After some research, I purchased the Olympus D-565, and I am extremely happy with it.  It solved the old issues I had with the D460.  The startup time of the camera is extremely fast, and it is ultra-compact.  The picture quality is excellent in both bright or low-light environment.  The D-565 only uses 2 AA batteries, and the battery life is better than the D460.  I am extremely happy with my purchase, and highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants to purchase a quality digital camera for under $300.", "Date": "November 24, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great 8 x 10 prints from Ofoto", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "ROESA8VAZDWOE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had an older 2 mega pixel Olympus and it was fine but larger 8x10 prints were just OK.

This camera takes great pictures in all types of lighting. The flash is nice and powerful. If you are taking pictures with white or reflective background you might want to turn off the flash. You'd be amazed at how bright the picture looks without flash. When reviewing the pictures on the LCD, they look so crisp. The supplied AA's ran out pretty quickly but the fresh batteries I just put in seem to be lasting quite long. I picked up some rechargeable batteries too. The nice thing about a camera that uses AA is...you can get them anywhere! My old Cannon used the CR5 battery but those were about $10-13 each! My friends who have cameras with proprietary batteries are stuck with buying more rechargeable batteries from the manufacturer. Not ideal for long trips or hikes where you dont have access to outlets.I picked up a 256mb xD card. At the highest quality I could store around 85 pictures.Great camera!!", "Date": "December 20, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great little camera for price", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3JCHMFDPK6QJB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought the olympus d565 camera with an epson 5400 all in one printer from office max for $299.99 . So in reality this camera cost me $150 or so. Thats a great price for a 4 megapixel camera and its an olympus camera too!There weren't too many reviews on this camera, but I'm very impressed with the results so far. I've taken very nice pictures in alot of different settings and the camera produced real nice images. Take the previous reviewers advice and turn off the flash if you want a better white background in your picture.This camera is small enough to fit in your pocket, it uses 2 batteries (aa) - buy rechargeable batteries, they last so much longer. I got rayovac( radio shack brand ) ic3-15 minute rechargeables with a charger and I took about 60 high quality pictures with them and the batteries still have juice in them. The aa's included with the camera were used up after 9 shots .The only problem ( solved) with this camera is opening the front cover to turn the camera on. If you gently slide the slide over, sometimes the camera won't start up. After practice I learned that you have to slide it over while gently pushing down on it. Pushing down gently on the cover will sliding it over starts the camera.", "Date": "December 27, 2003"}, {"Title": "Best bet for your buck on 4 MPs !!!!", "Author": "Armin Afshar \"arm1351\"", "ReviewID": "R27A91RV05ML1L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At first, I was pretty disappointed with the picture quality.3-4 pictures out of every 10, came out blurry! So make sure you read that manual before you get started! D-565 is just a bit more than a \"point & shoot\" camera and if you learn how to use it, you will love the crisp picture quality and it's ease of use! Alkaline batteries are totally out of question as this camera has really been designed to use rechargeable NiMH or CR-V3 Batteries. My rechargeable Kodak NiMH batteries can take a good 150 pictures before they run out of juice. The only two negative things about this camera in my opinion are:-The auto focus is relatively slow.-The Low Battery warning will start flashing too early when the batteries are still almost half way full.Aside from the minor things above, I think this camera is probably the best bet for your buck on 4MPs.", "Date": "February 13, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great 4mp camera!!!!!!!", "Author": "\"sat208\"", "ReviewID": "R2GC65ZD1BIYC0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this Olympus D565 for about a month. I love this camera. It is easy to use, small, fits anywhere. I bought this camera for $299.99 at OfficeMax AND it came with a Espon 5400 all in one printer!I do recommend getting a higher XD-Picture Card for this camera, It comes with a 16MB card, you only take 5 pictures at high res. I got a 128MB card with that you can take 44 high res pictures.This camera can take AA batteries which you can get anywhere.It has a strong flash for this size camera.The pictures came out great, easy to download to your computer.Great software with this camera. You cant beat this price for a 4MP camera.You can download the manual and see if it fits your needs. This is a great 4MP camera!!!!", "Date": "January 14, 2004"}, {"Title": "Good photos but look at the Manual before buying", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1ABSQSHIV5TAT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, the bulleted description in Amazon is incorrect; the LCD monitor is fixed to the back and is not adjustable in any way. The photos of from this camera are good though I did not take that many before returning it. There are only 6 buttons on the back of the camera so most of the controls for this camera need to be chosen from menus on the screen, ie, changing from video to stills, flash options ect. The lens cover does not open all that smoothly but does seem sturdy. The flash is very bright for a camera this size and as other reviews have pointed out you should try taking pics without it. Besides AA batteries this camera can use CR-V3 lithium battery packs. Using new AA Duracell alkaline batteries this camera took about 30 seconds of video and 20 medium res photos  about half with flash before running out of juice though I did mess around with the controls for about 15 minutes while I wasn't taking photos. I'd recommend rechargeables or the CR-V3 packs. The included 16 Mb xD picture card is woefully inadequate but this is a complaint about most (all) digital cameras. It can take 5 4Meg pics and its done. Though the xD format is new it is a lot smaller and faster than Compact Flash but it is more expensive. There wasn't a noticeable shutter lag that some digital cameras seem to have though taking multiple photos when not in continuos mode took about 1.5-2 seconds between each take. I would rate the pics and form factor for this camera both 4 stars. But for me the menu driven controls was a big downside. The expense of additional xD cards as well as the battery life were also negatives. The LCD screen seems like it would be easy to scratch so get a case for it.I strongly suggest looking at the manual (from the link on the product description page) to see if you're going to like this camera. The strongest plus is that it takes great pictures at 4 Mega-pixels for the price.", "Date": "January 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "The D-565 is simple to use & doesn't eat batteries!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2SR749U87S9S4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a hardcore 35mm user, this was my first experience owning a digital camera.

Bottom line: Great focus, color saturation, flash/fill, ease of use, subject satisfaction! 6 to 8 shots on alkaline batteries - ordered AC Adapter from Amazon.com - carry pocket full of AA's when prowling for shots.

I could not get the largest file photos to work well and thought that I perhaps needed a tripod or something. I was okay with the less pixel pictures for what I was using it for. Then, after a while, some of the lower quality pictures came out blurry- some looked like a soft focus and some were so blurry you could not tell what it was. Even on the lowest quality setting, about 9 of 10 pictures are completely unusable- even when taking the lowest quality pictures. I have missed many family moments including my parent's 50th wedding anniversary photos due to this problem. After contacting Olympus, they know it is an issue but (not covered since warrantee is up)will only repair it at a price that is more than I could buy another comparable camera for. Why bother with the hassle and the chance that it will continue to have problems?

We bought it mainly because it was on sale, and it came with the highest mega pixel in the market at the time of purchase. It produces good quality pictures I must say. However, the design of user-interface for the camera need more improvement. I agree with one the reviewer who mentioned that the cover slides open easily, and even a slight push on the cover while taking pictures would turn the camera off, which was annoying as one has to push the cover open again and wait for the lense to extent, an anti-climax for people wanting a quick shot! another weakpoint about its-user interface, is that, one can't view the pictures with the cover 'open'. One has to turn off the camera (closing the cover), and only then the viewfinder menu would work. pretty annoying when one wishes to view the picture immediately after the shot, needing to shut down the camera, view and turn it on again for the next shot! I think the viewfinder uses up too much battery, and we had to reserve energy by switching off the viewfinder while taking pictures! what do you think? having a viewfinder is one of the main feature of a digital camera!!!! I think the camera should be designed to recharge the batteries without having to remove them, and this camera uses AA batteries, which dries out very quickly when we use the viewfinder. Another bummer today.. I was transfering the photos from the camera to my PC and and the camera has to be turned on all the while (meaning the cover has to be opened with the lenses extended). without realising it, the battery ran out, now I can't retract the lenses and it is still sticking out till I get home to change the batteries! How high tech! Guess I have more dissapointment to discover! This is an expensive lesson to learn on digital cameras. For first timers, I would suggest to invest some money on digital cameras magazines and check out reviews on the Net, learn more about them, go to shops, toy with them before buying them impulsively!!!

It was a little slow, and the pictures weren't always great, but I could live with that. Then, two days ago all of a sudden it stopped working. One minute, my husband was taking a photo of the cats, and when he went to take another he got a black LCD display and it took a black photo. We tried again and again- all black photos. There had not been any trauma to the camera at all! One minute good, next minute dead. We tried all the tricks to fix it and I went on line to see if anyone else had experienced this black screen phenomenon. It seems that some Sony users had this problem and it was due to a defective CCD chip that was used in many brands including Olympus manufactured in 2002. Sony was fixing defective cameras, so I figured I wouldn't have any problem with Olympus fixing mine. WRONG! The operator at Olympus denied this problem and told me it may be humidity! It's October in PA- the camera was indoors- it worked then didn't work - I'm not buying the humidity theory! He then told me I could have it fixed for $109.00 by Olympus- no thanks! I allready spent way too much money on this camera in the first place. It quit working for no reason, I don't trust it now! My other option was to trade it in for a discount on 1 of 3 offered Olympus models. I looked up the discount I would receive on the models- a whopping $40.00! Thanks a lot Olympus!

Kinda like a Jag; better buy two, so you have one to use while the other is in the shop  for whatever is wrong with it this time.Worked great fresh out of the box on a January, 2003 vacation in Switzerland, except for the slowww shutter response.Slowwwww!It's been all down hill since then.Sure it burns batteries; but the real pisser is when you drop newww batteries in, open the lens cover and nothing happens. You open the battery door, close the door and yes, yes, well maybe the lens will activate and the monitor illuminate.Maybe not.The battery door seems to be an issue on Olympus cameras of this design.Nice: especially when your taking the pictures of those special events,. Proms , 18th birthdays. Well you know.Another issue seems to be the cards. Both of my 256 cards and the emergency 16mb back-up have unexpectedly popped-up with the blue screen; (formt), message. The 256's on Xmas day!This with 20-40 pix already on the 256 cards. Great way to celebrate the Xmas holiday with relatives; all shooting with their SONYS and NIKONS!Maybe Xmas 2006...Olympus tells me to take the cards to a drug store and ask them to recover and either print or copy to disc, the pictures already on the cards, IF they can be recovered.Weak!!!They tell me if I have them service the camera for $99.00, they'll warranty it for 6 months.Listen, the total wear and tear on this camera I purchased three years ago for the Swiss trip, is about three months. I don't shlep it around everywhere with me to take pictures of crap. No extreme sports, like camera flinging. Just a warm and fuzzy camera holster and gentle touching.

I loved that camera, but what a dissapointment the D-565 has been!  I often have grainy photos; the flash is shallow--harsh in the foreground and inefective on even close background items; it is a poor camera for use in taking photos of children, as it has a big red-eye problem, yet the red-eye reduction flash is terribly slow and kids don't sit still that long; the focus is slow, and even when it signals that it is in focus, I can get blurry pictures; the optical zoom control is jerky and hard to control.  I have been through the manual and the online help and cannot rectify the extensive problems with this camera.  I have talked with a company technician about the problems, and she was not able to provide me any more suggestions or options.  My sister bought the same camera at about the same time I did, and she has the same problems.  I was expecting much more from this camera.  To make matters worse, I bought it at a national office supply store during its early availability, and paid a lot more for it than Amazon charges now. I bought the camera primarily to take photos of my new daughter, and I am so dissapointed!The D-565 does take better photos outside than indoors.

This camera was incredible. However, it was a little more complex/sophisticated and bulky than we wanted. We wanted a camera as simple as the 490. So, we sold the G-2 and bought the Olympus D-565. More than half of all indoor photos are out of focus. About a third of outdoor photos are not in focus. Even in-focus  photos are not as crisp as those from the 490 (only 2 mp). Go figure! Anyway, if all you want is primarily outdoor snapshots, the 565 is compact and simple to use. After taking photos at two very important events and being thoroughly disappointed I have replaced this camera with a Canon PowerShoot S50.  It's 'focus success rate' is about 19 out of 20.
