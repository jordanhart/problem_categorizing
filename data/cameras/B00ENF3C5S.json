Mounts are not the greatest but do the job.  Watertight  case needs improvement as it leaks.  Case is good for rain and vibration reduction when shooting in a car or bike.  Video is as good as cameras that cost 3X as much.  Didn't give it 5 stars because of the watertight case.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great as Action Camera, bad as CAR DVR.", "Author": "Lisa W.", "ReviewID": "R24Q7G7O1GX5PU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera too and wanted to use it mainly as a CAR DVR.I would recommend people to buy this as a cheap alternative to GoPro Hero.It matches the performance to Hero1 or maybe even Hero2 in 1/3 of the price of a GoPro and it does comes with a lot of nice mounts and accessories for all sort of mounting options and usage.However, I would not recommend anyone to buy this as a CAR DVR because my unit simply does not turn off automatically when I turn off my car, and no matter how many times I set the screen not to turn off itself after 3mins it will ignore my setting and turn off its screen after 3 mins.Also, the car adapter that comes with it has a short cable compare to other real DVR.  The wire is not long enough for me to route it half way across the top of my wind screen, then down along the A-Pillar, and half way across the passenger dash to the center console where the power plugs ar.So, great as action camera, bad as CAR DVR.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT 12 MP, but good 5MP for the money", "Author": "C Pollmann", "ReviewID": "R1FWKMQU1PGGHM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is NOT a 12 MP camera. It has only a 5 MP CMOS sensor manufactured by Novatek, and anything larger in the settings merely interpolates (stretches) the images to make bigger files, just like stretching an image in paint, photoshop, etc. It also isn't designed to take any kind of physical stress like a GoPro or other true action cams.That being said, it's not bad for the price. Currently (2013) it's the best camera you can get for about $80 shipped. It has plenty of features, excellent video quality for the money, longer battery life than other cheap cameras, and it can record while charging too.  It also has a couple of nice features that make it great for a dash camera, like saving video files into segments and motion detection (although I haven't tested the latter yet).  Unfortunately, with all of the confusing mounting attachments (half of which are completely useless), it doesn't have a good dash mount without using one of the adhesive pads to glue a base to your dash. Otherwise the video is upside down becasue the camera doesn't flip the image like many less expensive cameras do.  Not bad for the money though.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$81.90", "Features": "Mini Full HD Sports Camera with 1080P resolution and 30 Meters Waterproof Range is a portable and useful recording device.\nThe ultimate solution for capturing them must see moments, whether you're into surfing, power boating, skiing, mountain biking or paragliding, this camera that is referred to as the \"Zenith\" will record everything and anything.
