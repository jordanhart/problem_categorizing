In sunlight, it works as any good point and shoot should, but insides or dark conditions the images will come out less than good.That said, if you are into any sort of amateur photography or even looking into getting a low end \"pro\" camera this is a great place to start. I've posted a couple pictures to show it off. It does take a little time to get used to the more advance features (manually setting ISO/Appeture/shutter speed) maybe an hour or so of research but I think it's all well worth it. Not only did that hour teach me a lot more about photography in general, but it turned this camera into an amazing piece of kit that's really giving me the results I wanted/expected.To some it up: If you just want a point and shoot camera with zoom, probably best to look elsewhere. If you're looking to get into photography a little more seriously and are willing to spend a little time experimenting and learning the lingo, you'll get some pretty impressive results.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "AMAZING FOR THE PRICE", "Author": "Nina", "ReviewID": "R20LNT78LFP0TH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my camera at walmart for only 179.99 and it is a completely great camera for someone switching from digital to slr", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrific Value", "Author": "ralphie_boy \"RF\"", "ReviewID": "R19OAVVZSDIJBN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Unlike Robert from Illinois, who paid the astoundingly low price of $83, I happily paid 149.99 for this camera thinking that the specs were too good to be true but it's worth the gamble. WRONG! This is a great camera even at $150 assuming you are coming from a lower resolution point and shoot as I was(Sony DSC-W1 at 5MP and excellent in it's own right). 14MP is amazing for this average joe of a photographer.Today I went to my local arboretum and took some greenhouse flower and outdoor landscape photos in diminishing afternoon light. All handheld and when I viewed them on my PC at home I was extremely pleased with my results. Very crisp photos with great detail and color saturation even in natural light. As expected I could not focus in these light conditions at maximum focal length but that is the limitations of this type of camera that incidentally does not allow you to zoom or focus manually. Most of the 24x zoom range on this camera should be reserved for outdoor conditions. The image stabilization works very well and you can get away with hand holding it if you're just looking for a useable image otherwise bring the tripod along. It does however have a neat function in SP mode called \"Natural\" that will expose one image without flash and one with with one press of the shutter. In most cases I was most happy with the no flash images. The flash is intelligent and does a nice job of matching the amount of flash output to the existing natural light. I really like the fact that you must manually pop up the flash so it will not fire unless you want it too.The user interface is also user friendly if you take some time to familiarize yourself with the user manual which is available on the cd or as a pdf download from Fuji's site. I found this camera's menus much easier to navigate than my Sony DSC-W1's. There are plenty of options for the more demanding user as well as the Auto and Program functions that works surprisingly well for most situations.So why didn't I give it 5 stars? Two reasons. The first one is that you cannot use this camera for any purpose without removing the lens cap. Since they began putting such large displays on these cameras I would really like the ability to review my photos without taking off the lens cap. The second is the LCD monitor. My Sony has spoiled me. When it was introduced it had one of the largest LCD displays available at the time and is fairly clear even in moderately bright light. I got into the habit of checking each photo after taking it. The S4250/4200's LCD is low resolution for it's size as well as being very difficult to see in anything but indoor lighting conditions. I am not comfortable with having to wait to go indoors or viewing on my PC to check my photo's condition, even though my results were surprisingly acceptable.As I said earlier this purchase was a gamble. I was researching superzoom cameras for an upcoming trip to Alaska and the price for this feature set seemed like a great bargain and too good not to investigate. I pulled the trigger knowing that I might be disappointed but if so I could return it and continue my search, which is not something I normally do. That said, I am definitely not disappointed in this camera but I will be returning it for these reasons and purchasing the Fuji HS25EXR, which has a brighter LCD and allows me to turn the camera on without removing the lens cap. The CMOS sensor, 2MP extra, longer zoom and manual zoom/focus doesn't hurt either! Hell,it's only money!NOTE: This review is meant for the more casual and budget conscious photographer and the high rating is meant to reflect that as I feel that is Fuji's target audience. Please do not respond with technical evidence to the contrary as that will only confuse me. Thank you.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera with good overall quality pix", "Author": "Robert L. Schlessman", "ReviewID": "R3QLF8GZFWSHSW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We had been looking for quite some time for a better camera than the cheaper five year old Kodak we were currently using. It worked well for standard snapshots and close-up pix, but for anything that required zooming in, it was horrible. Concert pix were next to worthless which was very frustrating. But cameras that had the features we desired were out of our price range. And given that all we have had for the past fifteen years are cheap point and shoot cameras, and simple snapshot flash cameras before that, we were somewhat intimidated by all of the variations.So, I fell into the deal of the year when I found this camera on clearance at Wal-Mart for $83.00. I knew I could always return it if I wasn't happy, but let me tell you folks - that ain't happening. After only a day of trial usage I am sold on this camera. I took pictures inside and outside in all lighting conditions with excellent results. This camera is much more than just a point and shoot, though when using the Auto settings it works well for that too. I took a shot down a side street from our front porch in both normal and zoomed modes. The day is cloudy and overcast. I was zoomed at 20X and even with my shaking hands you can read the street sign two blocks away on the zoomed image. I was extremely pleased to say the least!I love being able to close the flash and not worrying about it. With our old camera, I would disable the flash (at concerts for example), but if I switched to a different setting the flash would go back to auto mode. I would take my picture forgetting to disable the flash again, and people around us would be quite annoyed, especially given that flash photography was not allowed. With this camera all I have to do is close the flash and it's disabled; problem solved.Pictures in low light look good too with and without flash. I took some video of my wife working in the kitchen and the quality was very good. It is a little heavier than we are used to but once again that should be expected. I could have paid the list price for this camera and still would be very pleased with it. I can't wait for our next concert!A couple of cautions - The digital display tends to show lower quality on your shot than what is really the case. The pictures always look better than the previews. And be sure to pick up a memory card because this camera has no internal memory. Without a memory card you can't use it. Wasn't a problem for me because I had a spare 32 Gig card.To summarize, this camera has a lot of features that will take you a while to learn but it can also be used for basic photos in a very short time. If you are looking for a simple point and shoot pocket camera then I suggest looking elsewhere. The size, accessories and weight will require a case to carry it. But if you want a camera with video capability, that will give you good quality shots in all lighting conditions, has good zoom features and you don't mind experimenting to learn how to use it to its full potential, then this camera is for you. It is simple enough for the novice and powerful enough for the more experienced non-professional photographer.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stop looking this is the one for you !!", "Author": "marsmoon117", "ReviewID": "R1LEK2RR1NKCFR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looked for about 30 days before I decide on this one. and here's why: I read a lot about people having problems with the flash on their other Fujifilm cameras like the S4200 so I decided to go and look at walmart to see if the camera was just poorly built. they only had the S4250 model and it looked great. and dose have some weight to it. too me that is a good sign of being well built. after talking to the guy at walmart about the Fujifilm camera S4250 he told me it was on sale for $119.00, amazon wanted $209.00 for it. at this price I couldn't pass on it, even if the flash was messed up on it.I posted some pictures that I took with the S4250 just using only the setting of SRauto and none of the pics were retouch up. I think they look great for someone who knows nothing about these kinds of cameras, I will be taking classes in the spring. but I think the pictures speak for them self's, and I had no problems with the flash working at all.once I take the classes I will be buying another camera like the Nikon D3200 but for right now being new to this the Fujifilm S4250 is a GREAT CAMERAP.S. even at amazon's $209 it would of been well worth it !!!!!", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW", "Author": "Jack Shew", "ReviewID": "R3Q706N7P7S3K8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent camera for the money.
