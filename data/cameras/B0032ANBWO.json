Especially in low light situations the pictures often blur or are just black or really dark.Buy it as an extra camera, but have a better one for important situations.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "~Worth EVERY Dollar~", "Author": "gauge_2008", "ReviewID": "R3LY87JX8YNWMR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a light weight camera with a nice zoom.

I've tested it out for over a year now...well lets start by saying this camera is ok. Nothing great! I had high hopes for this camera... I bought the pink one because I am a girly girl and absolutely love pink! The color & build of this camera is good. Design wise it is awesome. The camera is sturdy, construction is good, I have dropped this camera 2-3 times on accident and everything seems just fine. Lightweight, easy to travel with.Pictures are nothing special. Don't expect anything great, blurry and grainy low light pictures. Oh and low light, by that I mean any lighting after like 3pm, its practically too dark to take pics. Especially indoors. When I use the timer to snap pics, the last 2 pics always come out blurry. Extremely frustrating.This is a good everyday, just snapping pictures of my life to go on FB camera. I find that it is just not good enough for blogging and selling items online. Which is what I purchased this camera for. Its not the worst camera in the world, but its not the best either, so I am back on the hunt for a better digital camera.", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "The girlfriend loved it", "Author": "Me", "ReviewID": "R1VXQZO2UN0PBD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera when it was a gold box hot deal for $49 as a stocking stuffer for my girlfriend.

I used to not be a big picture taker but now I don't go anywhere without it. The battery life is wonderful. I take hundreds of pictures and turn it on and off all day without any problem. I am only on the second charge and I have been using it every day for weeks. I recommend using the advanced mode where it auto-edits your pictures for color contrast and shakiness. I am not a good picture taker but this advanced setting makes my pictures look fantastic because it automatically senses what type of photo you are taking and then adjusts accordingly. Supposedly this drains batter but I have kept it on this setting consistently and, as I said before, that battery life is incredible. The only draw back to this setting is that it takes a moment to adjust the picture after you take it so you cannot take photos rapidly. Make sure it is on the regular setting if you need to take a quick series.---I just received my camera in the mail this evening and have not had a long time to play with it but my initial reactions are very positive. I have been loooking for a camera to replace my 8 year old canon but I am not a big picture taker (maybe a result of how slow and clunky my old camera is) so I did not want to shell out a lot of money on something I wouldn't use much. This little Casio fits the bill. It takes decent pictures and 14.1 Mp is really generous for the price. It is definitely just made for general use so you can't expect it to compete with fancier models. For those occasional picture takers it is a great thing to have around.I happened to snag it during the flash sale on Amazon which only made it $49.99 for me which may bias me a bit because I feel like I stole it but I think under $100 is more than reasonable for a name brand 14 Mp digital.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simple and awesome", "Author": "Eka Aditya", "ReviewID": "R2THK05EHOV63X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera really good looking.

You will need to keep power off and on again to get it back to normal for another few minutes. Returned it for a replacement, however, replacement came with similar defect again.
