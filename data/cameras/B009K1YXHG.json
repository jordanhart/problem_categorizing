She is an enthuastic new photographer at 7 years old. I am a photographer, so I didn't expect much. The first step is to charge the battery. It takes a long while, be patient.  Next, when I first got it, it was a real challenge to get the menus from the Japanese characters into English! Here is the secret to save you the frustration and lots of time. The menu has two sections, the camera and the tools. To switch to ENGLISH, go to the tools and cursor down five (5) rows and then right.Its a cute little camera capable of medium low resolution, has the resolution of an iPad. Pictures aren't the best quality, but it does work.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Color: Black\nBody size (about): 6.6 x 4.3 x high back 2cm width\nWeight (about): 33g", "Name": "Bonzart LIT Digital Camera Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412sCPVSuaL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009K1YXHG"}}
