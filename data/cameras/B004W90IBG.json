{"Reviews": [{"Title": "EASY BREEZY!!", "Author": "slippersister \"slippersister\"", "ReviewID": "R1E7YUA194DN2Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am far from being an electronic wizard so I was very concerned about being able to easily (a) take pictures (b) review, edit and delete pictures and (c) dump pictures from a card into my computer.  PLUS I wanted to do all of this with minimal manuial reading, downloading from the manufacturer and watching endless CD-ROMs and never getting the answers I needed.  If these, too, are your criteria, BUY THIS CAMERA RIGHT AWAY!  This camera is so easy to use and so user friendly, it's ridiculous!  Not only that but Amazon has the BEST deal on the internet and I was able to purchase a cute purple bundle w/a leather case and strap, memory card and camera for $100 LESS than my local Radio Shack (they didn't have the bundle, fyi).  The pictures are clear and crisp.  Honestly, my relatives ooh and aah over my candid snaps which are over-the-top charming and fun.  I love the confidence I have taking pictures that I KNOW are going to be excellent AND look cute and coordinated while doing it!  One negative remark is the fact that it takes a few seconds between pictures for the camera to re-set...a minus when you're trying to capture candid moments in succession.  But this is a minor quibble compared to how easy and wonderful this camera is to use!  EXCELLENT PURCHASE!", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beyond Adequate", "Author": "Cassandra Ray", "ReviewID": "R3EZ099DWD1N0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There have been many reviews that give this camera a less than satisfactory rating. The reasons range from the pictures being blurry to software problems. Well, I would like to tell you that I have no problems whatsoever. I worry that many people have trouble with blurry pictures because they fail to realize that you have to slightly depress the snap button in order to get it to focus. This is kind of a new idea, but I am a strong supporter for it. It allows YOU to have more control over what your picture will look like compared with earlier generations of cameras. The screen is BEAUTIFUL. The colors are very vibrant. I have taken videos and the video quality is definitely above normal quality, but the sound is what to write home about. The sound is crystal clear. The case here is normally like 50$ by itself, so you are practically getting the camera for a steal. I would recommend this to anyone who is an amateur photographer, who enjoys carrying around a camera all of the time but really wants good quality photos to reflect upon.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little pocket camera", "Author": "Gaea", "ReviewID": "R1H17RBZU6B9G3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an excellent little point and shoot camera.  In addition to this little pocket cam, I also have a Cannon Rebel XTi.  As that camera is too big to carry around all the time, I often use this camera for friends' birthday parties, quick hikes, etc.  I have been surprised at the quality of photos this camera produces.  Occassionally, they are even better than the Rebel photos.  The touch screen is a great feature, and I like being able to scroll with the screen.  The memory card holds A TON of pictures.  I can go months without deleting.  The size is super convenient and fits in my pocket.  A few issues:  1 - You have to use your fingernail to scroll when using the touchscreen, it doesn't like finger tips.  Not sure that it would be of much use to someone with very short nails. 2 - I have not been able to figure out how to format the memory card from the camera.  I load all the photos to my computer, then delete the camera pics while I'm in the folder (on the comp).  3 - You have to charge using your computer or a USB port to wall converter.  There is no removable battery pack to charge (biggest drawback).  Overall, the value for the money can not be beat.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - Great Value", "Author": "ColoradoEngineer", "ReviewID": "RK22C4SYK8YUY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera fit our needs to a tee.

Even my camera phone takes better pictures. When I snap photo's, I only pray that they'll turn out good.

I have a Nikon D80 SLR and a Nikon Coolpix S3 (which i've had for 5 years and has been amazing). I thought upgrading to this Nikon Coolpix S4100 would be better than my S3, but it's not much better. The pictures don't look any better than they did when taken on my S3. The touch screen is kind of annoying at times, and sometimes the screen will freeze up. I've noticed my pictures sometimes seem blurry, and the night mode is not as great as I thought it would be. It's light weight, easy to charge, and the 4GB SD card is awesome, but the case is ok, and the camera is ok.

It's small, takes clear pictures, large screen size and cool color (plum).  At first I hesitated because of the reviews stating the screen was sensitive to touch but I'm happy I went ahead and purchased it.  I do not use my finger, I use the Stylus that comes with it and I attached the Stylus to my strap - perfect.  The only thing I would suggest you should practice changing the scenes so you can get the best picture possible at all times.  The default auto scene doesn't produce a flash everytime you need one so you will need to select a different scene to get your desired result.The only negative I have with this purchase is Amazon shipping delay.  I initially purchased the camera with the free shipping as I used the option in the past but this time my camera didn't ship in 5 days.  I ordered it on Monday and it still didn't ship by Friday and my money was deposited back into my account (assumed it was only a 3 day hold).  Amazon has never taken more then a couple days to ship a product that states in stock so I'm not sure what the problem was but I cancelled on Friday and reordered paying for shipping and I received the camera right away on Monday.  Shipping Scam huh...not sure but Amazon free shipping get's a negative for me on this purchase. Next time I will contact them directly if possible before paying for shipping when I should have recieved it free.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "awesome camera", "Author": "we1shi", "ReviewID": "R3KT2W0DDUUGQC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in June and it is awesome! I would say that I use the camera on a daily basis and have had no problems with it. Its great for taking all kind of photos and it actually has some neat things you do with the photos after. I love that I can take a photo and then change it to black and white AND focus on one color i.e. I took a photo of my dog changed it to the black/white/one color option. The photo is all black and white apart from her red collar..pretty neat! I also love the touch screen.

It takes great photos.  Better than the Cannon Powershot SD1400 and Sony Cybershot. The only problem I would say is that the cable is so different from all other cables that you need a different one for each camera.  This is did not come with one that you can use for the computer so I had to purchase one from Ebay.Update after using it for about 6 months: pictures are very fuzzy. There is no need for the cable because you can take out the SD card and download the photos that way.

Plus, it came with the SD card and case.  It was great for about 3 days... then it started to freeze. I took the battery out and replaced it, and it worked for a couple more days. Then the screen went GREEN! Yes, green. The reaction time for the touchscreen was ridiculous! It would not power down, so the lens stayed sticking out. The only positive that experience that I can say about this camera is that it takes quality fireworks shots, and I like to editing potential for the pictures. Those two things are not worth it, so I returned the camera today!

It is light weight and I keep it in my purse with me all of the time.

The stylus does not attach itself to the camera body, it is external and needs to be clipped to the camera strap which I find some what awkard.
