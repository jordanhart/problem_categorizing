{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good range, clear picture, beautiful screen!", "Author": "engineer_dad", "ReviewID": "R2SLE4WICA2CVS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When our baby daughter reached 6 months of age and outgrew her bassinet, 'twas time for her to move to her nursery and sleep in her crib. My wife and I started looking for a baby video monitor - our requirements were digital transmission (clearer picture), 5GHz (to minimize interference), 3.5\" screen (easy viewability), good day and night video quality (picture clarity and contrast), easy pan/zoom controls (no fumbling with sleepy eyes!) and range (our bedroom is 50ft away down the corridor from the nursery). We didn't need a temperature sensor since another unit (Angelcare baby movement/sound monitor) does a decent job.We did extensive research and selected The First Years Home and Away Portable Video Monitor. It met most of these needs except for 5GHz transmission (works at 2.4 GHz). The key feature that attracted us to that monitor was their claim of 650 ft range, clear transmission. Alas - the range was not even 10% of what was advertised (loss of video at just 40ft away with minimal wall/furniture interference), rendering the product quite unusable.We started looking for video monitors with an *external antenna* hoping that this would solve the range problem and selected the Samsung SecureVIEW baby monitor. We are pleased to note that it does seem to have a longer range. We can now watch our baby in her nursery from our bedroom (~50ft) on most occasions. Moving the unit by 10 more feet causes more frequent \"out or range\" beeps and video loss.Overall pros of this monitor: (1) Good range (2) Clear picture (3) Beautiful screen (afterall who else in the industry would you trust to make a good LCD screen? :-  4) Good mechanical movement range of camera (We were able to mount the camera on the wall, right above the crib, alongside one of the edges and fishwire the power cable through the drywall - this gives us an excellent/unobstructed view of our baby).We haven't tried recording video images into a microSD card, USB connection, A/V connection, Skype etc. - but I'm sure that given Samsung's prowess in electronics, these would work as advertised.Cons: (1) Temperature sensor is simply busted (hence the reason for 4 stars instead of 5). Consistently reports 5-7F more than the room's actual temperature. Samsung needs to use a better thermal sensor, or fix calibration or improve the software used to arrive at more accurate thermal readings. We have disabled the thermal alarm feature (woke us up the first night!)Wish List: (1) The zoom/pan controls need to be accessed from a second level menu. The dedicated pan/zoom buttons work in record mode only. Seems like waste of dedicated hardware, since one would zoom/pan more often when simply viewing than during recording. (2) Docking cradle - we plug/unplug the power cable into the viewing unit; would be great to have a docking station.One other note - I must say that finding comparative information between various Samsung monitor products was a bit difficult at first.

We already had an older, black and white monitor that did rather well, but we wanted to try a more expensive color monitor to see how much better it could be.  Boy, oh boy were we disappointed!  It is a very nice looking piece of technology, but probably one of the worst buys we have made in a while.  We bought it at a big box store that only has a 90 day return policy and until now we really didn't get a chance to really put it through its paces.  The darn thing beeps or vibrates every time the baby cries!  I know the baby is crying...I can hear it on the monitor!  I don't need it to vibrate or beep to tell me that!  You can't even turn that feature off!  I called tech support, which sounds like a 3 man shop...I really think it is, and they said that is the way it was supposed to work.  Additionally, one of the advertised features didn't even work!  It is supposed to monitor the temperature of the room.  It consistently said the temperature was 82 degrees when our thermostat was set at 70!

Also, the kick stand is flimsy, handheld is very bulky for carrying around, and the sleep mode doesn't consistently wake up.Things that met my expectations include great picture (regular and night vision) compared to other baby monitors, good battery life (handheld lasts ~5 hrs while constantly on - and obviously much longer in sleep mode), good communication range,  versatile (all units run on either batteries or AC adapters), good mounting options, 2 way communication is great for temporarily calming a meltdown, Skype connection capability but really isn't all that useful and I really wouldn't video record or take pics - there's much better, higher quality, more accessible/practical ways to do this (e.g. your cellphone).It's still a good monitor but with all the low price technology out there, I expected more.Update 112911:  So, I just installed the Mac driver and was sorely disappointed.  Although the product description says it will display what is on the monitor, what actually displayed was just the upper right 25% of the monitor's view.  Unplugged the USB and my baby was in the middle of the monitor's screen - connected to computer and could only see the closet door behind the baby (see pic).  Sent an email to Samsung customer service a couple months ago and no response.  Boo samsung customer service & tech support.  :(So, would I buy again?  No.  I'd definitely go for the Motorola - I've had buyer's remorse ever since I realized Motorola's has the remote pan and zoom.  Plus, their monitor display seems to be clearer.  However, the best baby monitor set-up I've seen is using the Foscam pan/tilt/zoom cameras that can be monitored via apps using your mobile phone, even when away from the house.

I have never had a charger stop working.  I had to buy a new charger which cost $20.The really bad.  As discussed by numerous is the actualy working of the monitor.  I had an old monitor that you could sleep the picture but the sound would stay on so that you could still hear the baby with the screen off.  Perfect.  Assumed that was how all monitor were.  Nope.  This one when you sleep the picture the sound goes off as well.  The only way to have the picture off and know when your baby is crying is to adjust the sensitivity on the camera.  Then when your baby cries the screen pops on.  However, there is an added beep or vibration that goes with it that you cannot turn off.  and it is not just one beep or vibration its like five.  I now have the sensitivity turned to its lowest and i have to keep the picture on all night so that I will hear my baby.  That is usually workable.  But my son has a cough and everytime he coughs it makes the stupid thing vibrate.  All samsung needed to so was have an option of \"none\" so that it doesn't vibrate or beep.  And also there should be a option to have the sound on but the screen off.  Did samsung even test this product and try to sleep?  I am very disappointed.  I bought this product because in pretty much every other area samsung products are the best.

Yes it has a nice screen and infrared and multiple camera options, whatever.  But the control of the features is horrible.  As others have said, the \"trigger alert\" is the worst crime - this is where the monitor doesn't just let you hear your baby but it also makes an obnoxious alert if it picks up any sound, so you can't even hear the baby groan or whatever thanks to the stupid alert.  And you can't turn that feature off, you can only turn down the sensitivity level and choose between the annoying vibration or annoying beeping.  The volume control and brightness control on the monitor are way way too high - they were apparently set up by engineers in a loud office, not somebody in a dark room and possibly trying to sleep.  So the monitor sits there blazing bright and buzzing or beeping at you if the baby makes a noise, when really you just want to know if he's crying or just fussing and be able to look at the screen.  Then for some dumb reason the monitor's menu buttons also beep loudly with each press, so good luck adjusting the monitor near the camera where you need to be (i.e. near a sleeping baby).  Finally the temperature sensor is the most ridiculous feature - ours was off by 14 degrees F!  It started fine but after a few hours it said the baby's room was at 90 degrees.  I ran in with another thermometer to find it was just 76 degrees.  The tech service guy said to send it to California for repair.

If the baby makes a noise, it's going to happen. The thermometer seems to be way off too (like other have said).But those aren't the only problems.The firmware on this thing is horrible. If you want to zoom in, you need to press a button to get to a menu page where a list of truly incomprehensible pictograms pops up, scroll through the list until you find the zoom function, select zoom, toggle to 2x, confirm, then press the menu button again. SO, that's at least 7 or 8 button presses for something that should take no more than one press. And that's for almost every function on this thing (temperature, alarms, etc). It's just not a very usable monitor.We could overlook those flaws, though, because it had some nice features: good screen, good sound, a light on the camera. Because of the terrible firmware, though, other functions seemed like too much of a hassle (skype, for example).But the last straw was when the battery failed to keep its charge only after about 4 months. It is to be expected (though it happened pretty fast), but that's not the end of the story.
