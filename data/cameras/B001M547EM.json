It installed with no hitches at all, within 3 minutes up and running and recording (Win XP). Mine came set to PAL, so be sure to check your settings. I recorded over 8hrs last night and it came out to a 2 gig avi file. During the day recording, it seems the files will be smaller.

I bought this to upload my four outside cameras to a website.  In order to do this, I need a constant filename.  I had been using an ancient snappy w. snapcap s/w with a video switcher to upload to my website but the snappy started having problems.  This device lets you view all four channels at once, and will save a jpg of the channels at a timed interval.  However, you can't name this jpg what you want, it defaults to date/time format, no matter what.  You can manually name a shot, but since I wanted a jpg at five minute intervals, this is too much manual for me.  It will also not ftp automatically, but there's other free s/w to do that.  Computer is a 1.2ghz pentium running XP.  No other s/w except my weather station s/w runs on this so there appears to be lots of computing power for the app.  Three *'s for this.Update: Worked with limitations as stated above for two months, then suddenly died.

There is nobody to talk to if you need help with the installation or if you just have basic questions regarding the product. There is a forum on there website that is suppossed to help, I couldn't find any thing that helped. I cannot speak for other systems I am using a Dell Inspirion 17R with windows 7. This might be the perfect product for someone using an older operating system. The actual device itself seemed to be ok and I recieved my item in about 2 days however good luck trying to figure out the installation and software. If there is something I can say that would help the seller is that they must create a better website that is more user freindly and establish some sort of customer service to assist people with software and installation.

This item will not work with all cameras (higer res, or more scan lines). Motion detection is flaky at best. Not even worth sending back because the postage will cost as much as the item. It may work better with upgraded software though. I have yet to find it useful. Computer: 1.8G Intel 1G of Ram. This may be good for someone who wants to watch four cameras in realtime without the record feature or use manual record option.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Viewing Only", "Author": "Matthew G.
