Also I had to call Q-See to get the cable and power adapter I was told by Q-See that all there cameras sell with these items! The seller said I was wrong? I have 8 other Q-See cameras that all came with the 60' cable and P/S and Q-See confirmed they all sell with such so if you buy one you might have to call Q-See the get the missing parts! And only authorized persons are allowed to sell the products on a site like amazon! Per there rules listed on there site. My camera was shipped direct from Q-SeeUpdate it has started to fail the color is way off I will not buy anything from Q-See again I have 8 off their smaller cheaper bullet cameras that are 3-4 years old and they still work like new this unit and another like it were a waste of $$$$$$ my $30.00 webcam gets a better picture than these over priced Cameras you are better off with their low end cameras you will get more for your money!!!!! also these cameras need to be readjusted after a power outage they have no memory retention at all even for a few seconds and getting to the little joystick on the cable near the camera is not practical once installed! also buying a UPS battery back up for each of them is also not practical.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappoint!", "Author": "sean", "ReviewID": "RAUQ3Z0QCB0T3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had high hopes for this camera, on paper everything looked good; long day/night range, new EFFIO-E chipset 700TVL.
