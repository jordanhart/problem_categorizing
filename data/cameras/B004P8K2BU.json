You can take hi-resolution snapshots, time lapse photography, annotate images, and even record video and save it to an SD card or a USB flash drive --all without hooking up to a computer.The images are clear and detailed (5 megapixels). The 8x optical zoom is fantastic. I used it to zoom in on an old coin to reveal detail.You can control the F50 with the included remote control. It has a lot of buttons but they are well organized.The 5-year warranty is the best I've ever heard of.I absolutely love the F50 and will probably be using it every day in my classroom.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R1CK07HCBZXV74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you have come to this page, then you already know about what a great product this is.
