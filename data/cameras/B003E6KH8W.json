simple to setup, and couldn't be easier to navigate the menu's once you're completely setup.Since the audio on my digital camera doesn't work:The first half of the video was live footage of what was being recorded at that moment. Then you'll see me easily and quickly navigate the menu to go back to midnight of the night before and show the nightvision capabilities. The camera(3) I zoom in on shows a dark corner that would appear completely black to people looking at it. The nightvision capability of this system is awesome. Camera 2 shows a car in the street, that area has no light around it and you can still clearly see the car and surrounding area.All in all I'm happy with my purchase. I did a LOT of research before making this purchase and it payed off. I'd definitely recommend this product to a friend.UPDATE::: The system is working great still with the exception of one camera. The night vision is blurry on one camera and there is obviously something wrong with that specific camera since the problem followed the camera to the four mount points. I contacted SVAT customer service and they told me to send the camera back. I did and two months later I received an email from them saying the camera works fine and they're sending back the original. I received the original back and it still has the problem. They must not have read what I wrote was the actual problem. I'm disappointed with their customer service this time and I guess I'll just buy another camera to replace the broken one.UPDATE 2::: I uploaded another video real fast to show the system again. The file was too large so I used a free file converter to change the format to make the file smaller. I guess they watermark the video and limit it to 3 minutes. Not a big deal cause it was only 3:09 so the entire video is essentially there. Sorry for the watermark though.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "2+ Years and Going Strong", "Author": "G.

She also said the DVR needs to be within 15-20 feet of the internet feed which is not noted anywhere. After spending over 60 minutes waiting on the phone for an available agent I finally sent an e-mail as they suggested. After 3 days I finally received a very brief e-mail which did not answer my questions. A few days later I was finally able to talk with an agent. She connected to my laptop and made some changes and said I was set. Well, like I said - no I-phone and no internet connection to the system.

I have not had the time to go through all the set-up and recording options, but they seem pretty straight forward.  Basically, once you plug in the cameras and power up the DVR, the system is recording.  The definition of the system is about what I expected....about standard definition TV quality.  (Remember what that is?  Before High Def.)  If you want high def, you will spend A LOT OF MONEY.My biggest complaint is the cheesy little camera mounting brackets.  None of the 4 included in the box are very stable (the ball joint for the camera cannot really be torqued into stability.  If you do try to tighten them too much, the plastic handle just spins on the threaded lock screw.  One of the mounts was totally inoperable -- the head assembly just flops around, so it is worthless.  I contacted SVAT and they are apparently sending a replacement mount.I was so disappointed with the mounting situation, that I have already ordered 4 after-market mounts that received pretty good reviews.  You might want to check out VideoSecu 4 Wall Ceiling Mounts for Security Video Cameras 2-6 inch Adjustable Pan Tilt Camera Mounting Bracket 1S8  I haven't received them yet, but at least they are alleged to be steel, instead of the SVAT pot metal mounts.UPDATE (6/7/2012):  After looking at additional video monitoring systems, I have relegated this system to backup duty due to lack of resolution (420 line) and (honestly) crappy night vision lighting.  SVAT actually has the huevos to call the cameras \"hi def\".  I found much better products from Q-See, with cameras of 600 line resolution and night vision capabilities to put this system to shame.

So far I have not had any overheating issues and I believe the reason for this is twofold:1) I live in Upper Michigan and we have cooler temperatures up here even in the summertime.2) The DVR is kept in the basement where it is cooler.  (For those of you who think about breaking in you'd better bring some C4 and blasting caps 'cause that box is indestructible).The camera quality is decent but I, as others stated, should have spent a bit more for better quality.  Bear in mind however, that if you need to bring in the DVR to the cops to analyze suspicious activity then the quality does not matter too much.  The police have their own tools to get what they need off the DVR in higher quality than what you would expect. You might want to consider buying a supplement PTZ camera to supplement the 4 cameras that come with the system.  Believe me, you WILL find use for another camera.  I also recommend buying a trail camera to hide (if you live in the country like I do) to watch your road...just in case your system fails you or the bad guys steal it.  My final recommendation is buying a battery backup just in case you are dealing with professional criminals and they cut the power, which would render your camera system useless.  I know this seems a bit excessive but hey, if you have belongings to protect they take every precautionary measure to secure them!  My Platoon motto in the Army was simple, \"Trust nobody!\"Ps: don't forget to post signs identifying the fact that you own and use a camera system.

Shipping was unbelievably fast.  Connecting everything to the DVR / power supply was actually quite simple and doesn't require advanced knowledge or instructions at all.  The hardest part was running the individual cables through the wall.  Images are pretty clear, and the night vision only goes out about 15 feet.I rated this a 4 star though for a few reasons:a) I bought this because based on reviews I read, the customer support was apparently amongst the best available. They CLAIM 24/7 support, but a live person is only available during normal business hours.  Additionally, when calling during normal hours, you can only remain in the queue for 15 minutes, after which it goes to a voicemail where you have no clue if you'll ever get a call back.  So far, I haven't.b) The one thing I didn't like about running the cables was the size of the plug itself.  The wiring is super thin, which is nice because that means you only need a super thin hole in your wall to run it through.  But the plug itself requires you to drill a much bigger hole (it's about the size of the old Keyboard / mouse plugs that go into the back of your computer). So just to get the plug through the wall, I had to drill very large holesc) Setting up the networking wasn't terribly painful...but it wasn't very easy either...and still isn't working 100%.  The tutorials provided are helpful for the basics, but not for troubleshooting.  I'm running Win7/IE9 and can not see the cameras using Internet browser, despite all my firewalls being off and all netowork settings configured exactly to spec.  Firefox is out of the question since the system requires ActiveX. I would suggest using the NetViewer app provided on the installation CD for use on your home computers.  That seems to have given me an alternative solution to the problem.d) I have an IPOD touch and a Android Galaxy 10.1 Tablet.  The CD provides an app for the Tablet that seems to work well.  It does not provide an app for the Ipod / Iphone though.  The folder is there, but it has nothing in it.  You have to go the IPOD APP store yourself and install \"ASEE\"...which is listed no where in any of the instructions.  Once installed, you can view your cameras live on the Ipod.All in all, I am very satisfied with the system and would recommend it.

Very good daytime picture but limited at night. No way to reccognize faces once it gets dark outside. After about one month of use, I noticed some issues. For instance,on several occasions, when viewing recordings in 4 camera simultaneous mode, it would display all views and in about 5 seconds, it would switch to camera 1 view only. I needed to reboot the system several times to correct this. In one instance, the time stamp recordings of night time showed that it was between 12 AM and 5 AM but were showing broad daylight. For the price, it's OK but don't bet the farm on it or you will be dissapointed. For me it works. In fact, I had been wondering why the netting over my backyard pond was destroyed on three occaisions over the course of a week. When I reviewed the recordings on my SVAT system, I found myself watching my neighbors dog splashing around in the pond, thereby tearing the netting. The system allowed me to figure out where the dog was getting into my yard and I was able to fix a small gap in my stockade fence.One tip: The bugs are attracted to the infra red light at night which results in spiders taking up residence near the camera.

Originally I thought I might be able to mount the cameras inside the windows, but this turned out to be foolish due to the glare from the infra red. The maintenance guys for the landlord did the install on the outside walls of the house, probably about 15 feet up.  They did an ok job, but it seems that there are only two planes of motion once the cameras are mounted on a vertical surface, so it was difficult to get the images aligned properly and upright.  This was most true of the camera mounted on the side of the house looking up a driveway.  It is possible that there was a trick to it, but since I wasn't doing the install I am not sure.  As for the image quality, it seems pretty good, but as other reviewers mentioned it is definitely not high definition.  During times of the day when the cameras get direct sunlight, the color can become a little strange.  The night vision works, but I am a little concerned about the image quality (It would be very frustrating to watch footage of a person in the act, but not be able to make out identifying features.)  Since there is so much pedestrian and vehicle traffic in front of the cameras it will be tricky to get the motion detection not to trip.  There is a feature that allows you to fine tune which areas in in the field of view trip the motion detection, as well as the overall sensitivity of motion detection, but that will take some work, and for now I am content to let the cameras record everything.  The 500gb HD is good for hundreds of hours of video - 3 of 4 cameras have been running for close to a week straight, and there are over 300gb remaining.  As for the networking and smartphone feature, all of the documentation is written with Windows users in mind.  We've got Macs, and I am not sure how that will work out, or even if it can.

I find that this is mostly true. I mean you aren't going to be able to read the name badge on their shirt but you can certainly tell who it is.  The box that it came in was very sturdy and protected the cameras and DVR very nicely. The cameras especially seem to be of very good quality. One point to mention is that the screws that it comes with to mount the cameras are pretty flimsy. So if you have to move them (something I did)to adjust the angle and such they can easily break.  Set up was fairly easy I would say, and I am not a tech type. It doesn't come with a monitor so I used an old computer monitor and it worked great. I set the DVR and screen in the top shelf of a closet and ran all the cords up through the ceiling and out to the various points around the house that I wanted to set up the cameras.

The cameras do have good quality in my opinion and I was able to setup the dvr to view remotely.  I easiest way for me was to follow the port forwarding instructions to allow port forwarding on my actual router.  I followed the video provided that showed me how to do it and it worked great.  There is software included called net viewer that allows you to view the cameras, browse history, and do other things.  It's easier to use the net viewer software than to bother messing with internet explorer.  That also worked however but wants a 32 bit version of ie which can be a pain for some people.  I haven't used it too much at this point since I just bought it.  The only thing I noticed in my limited use was when I tried to fast forward through the few hours I had the cameras recording it was going slow.  I hit fast forward a few times so it was x4 but still was slow.  I think if you'd want to review the day quick you'd want to blow through the majority of the day when nothing is there.

I hooked up to a spare TV to set up all cameras and recording times. The hardest thing to do is run your wireing to each camera and keep it hidden or out of reach (my attic is getting smaller as I get older). I wanted the hard wire style because I don't want to worry about someone tapping in on a wireless system (I don't know if its possible but I want to be safe anyway). The cameras night vision is pretty good. The area is dark to the naked eye but on screen it is illuminated enough to make the persons face out (I set the recording to BEST)But one cameras nightvision was not working. I called the 1 800 number and told the rep. about it. She sent me a email with instructions to return the defective camera. You pay for the shipping and if they repair or replace the defective part they will pay for the return shipping(kind of a bummer). Dont throw away your receipt because you will need a copy of it to return any defective part. I've read the other reviews about calling in for customer service and can see why they say what they say but when I called the 1 800 number the recording said to leave a message. I didnt. I just dialed again. It said the same thing so I dialed again and the call was placed in waiting while this junk song played over and over. After about 8 minutes a real live person answered. She was very helpful and polite. She explained the procedure for returning a defective part and said that she would send me the email in approximatly 5 minutes. I waited for 1 hour and it did not arrive so I called again and went through the same re dialing game until a second real live person answered. I explained what had happened and she was very nice and said she would stay on line until I received the instructional return email. It uploaded in 30 seconds and I told her thank you. I have since mailed my defective camera according to instructions and am awaiting its repair or replacement. This is a good system and like anything, you can get a defective part. I hope the repair/replacement department is good. Customer service is also good but I think there phone system sucks.

I bought it because i had vehicle vandalism, And now with new tenants in Basement Apt and shady people (traffic) coming around i was happy to get this. Tho the people see the camera's they wear hoody's now. We all know what this means but my landloard he does not seemed concerned much. Any ways back to the review folks sorry. I placed 3 of the camera's outside of my second floor windows. During the day i get a real nice clear picture. At night i get a picture on my HD TY it comes in a bit fuzzy, But i am able to see my car and people come and go. It was very easy to hook this unit up starting with the DVR and Camera's. Then i downloaded the cd that came with it and followed the directions and had it hooked up to my internet and computer in minutes. Everything is easy to use on the menu just follow the directions and it is all easy going. To be honest i thought the video's would have been better seeing that first review but if i lived on the first floor this would be the best system in the world for the price!!! Lets put it this way if it was day time and i knew the person coming i would have no problem identifing them if it is a stranger and they look at my camera i can see them but wouldn't be able to Id the face for 100% sure if a crime was comitted but the clothing would do the trick! The neibor on the first floor is a nervous lady and said i could run a camera down to her window so that will be the bomb Face Shots!! So if you live on the second floor depending on what you need it for it maybe good for you as it would of been for me but my circumstances have changed and i need a closer shot exspecially at night time. I think they may have other camera's compatable i could buy that would help me at night and get a closer shot. I am going to look into that after my problem gets fixed...***PROBLEM***BOUGHT THIS UNIT IN JULY HERE BRAND NEW FROM AMAZON TONIGHT I POWERED SYSTEM DOWN AND UNPLUGGED IT SO I COULD PLUG MY INTERNET CABLE IN.

I WILL UPDATE YOU ON THE PROGRESS OF THIS SITUATION AS IT MOVES ALONG.SORRY FOR THE CAPITALS BUT SOME FOLKS MAY WANT TO SEE THE PROBLEM WITHOUT THE STORY ABOVE BUT THAT STORY WAS MY REVIEW AS WELL AND HOPE IT HELPS SOME CUSTOMERS LOOKING TO BUY AND LIVE ON A SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT..
