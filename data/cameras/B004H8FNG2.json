{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good-Looking Camera", "Author": "Berry Flavor", "ReviewID": "R1OXN00TH6FNGG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Opinions:---------I bought this camera because I wanted a low profile, a slim and sleek camera, while having good picture quality.My first opinion when holding this camera is that it is light-weight. I thought it would have a nice weight to it, like an iPhone. I can't complain, because this is probably better especially when you want to carry it in your shirt pocket and you won't look like a fool.The sliding mechanism that covers the lens is actually a thin sheet of metal coated with your favorite camera color. I think this gives it a cheap feel, but probably contributes to its lightweight.The OLED display is respectable. The pixel density is not like the latest DSLR camera display, the pixels are identifiable but still a good display.I use a Transcend 16 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC10E with this camera. Under maximum picture quality and size settings, it estimates about nearly 2800 possible pictures that can be taken (from when it was formatted). This is an estimate, usually it's  more based on my experience with other cameras (the estimate adjusts as the card fills up). Picture sizes vary between 2MB to 6MB (16MP size; 4608x3456), excluding some outliers.HD video is very good. the files are AVCHD videos, in *.m2ts files, the frame rate is smooth, and you can zoom in and out (4x optical, I disable digital zoom) while recording. One quirk about the video recording feature is that when I switch it to video mode, it automatically starts recording. And to stop recording and record again, I need touch the record-button on the screen rather than the dedicated capture button. It is possible to record in MPEG file format for compatibility, but it won't be in the highest-quality than what this camera was designed for. With this camera, you can take pictures while recording a movie, except in the highest video-quality (60p?) mode.Taking the pictures in ideal conditions (daylight, minimal clouds), the pictures are good, but it has hardware limitations. The CMOS sensor may be \"EXMOR R\" (whatever advertised connotation that may be), but 16.2 megapixels on such a small sensor leaves blurry image details when viewing at 1:1 ratio. But 16MP gives you more freedom to re-size and crop your images.The camera uses the Sony NPBN1 Rechargeable Lithium Ion Type N Battery Pack. But having such a large display (3.5 inch) and capturing HD videos and large images takes a toll on the battery life.This camera is compatible with SD card (SDHC, SDXC) in addition to Memory Stick. 5+ years ago, I used to own 2 Sony cameras, but I switched to Canon. I did it solely because Sony only prefers Memory Stick (little competition on speed, pricing, compatibility). I'm giving Sony a chance to redeem themselves.The 3D images are a gimmick. The image quality is reduced (and jagged) and it requires special software to view it. The included software can view it and you can connect it to a Playstation 3 to view it as well. The file format is in *.modd, and currently has limited usage outside of Sony.The panoramic image feature is OK. It takes images in a long burst (10 images) and compiles them into a single large image, but it is jagged (like the 3D images) where the images are combined.I picked this camera mainly because of its physical design, as well as the specs (large display, SD compatibility, HD video recording, and good auto-mode). I knew the camera has hardware limitations (Comes with all point-and-shoot. I'm spoiled by the DSLR image-quality), but I don't intend to carry a large camera (like DSLR) to parties or clubs. I want something that fits in my pocket.This camera is targeted at non-professionals who want to take good pictures that ultimately end up on their social-networking sites. This camera is intended for people who use the auto-mode that instantaneously detects and adjusts to the most appropriate settings to take great pictures. This camera does a great job, especially in low-light conditions, such as night events.Suggestions:------------Turn off GPS geotagging for privacy.When sliding the lens-cover open and during normal operation, it's easy to touch the lens with your finger. Cloth, including microfiber, does little to remove oil and usually smears more oil onto the lens. I actually use a \"lens pen\" to clean it. One end has a soft brush (lens safe) and the other end has a carbon powdered-tip. Carbon is good at removing oil and you can brush off any dust after. The cap that covers the carbon-tipped end has more carbon, so you can put the cap back on, and twist it a few times to get more.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "HD Video Review (comparison with the TX7)", "Author": "Venecius C. Thomas \"V.T.\"", "ReviewID": "R14LS6ASR60ZQL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I anticipated the release and ordered the TX100v to upgrade from the TX7. I mainly use these cameras for videography projects so I will be focusing this review on the HD video. The TX100v has slightly better video quality and better white balance than the TX7. The TX100v image stabilization is not so good and constantly changes focus causing the subjects to appear a little blurry in situations where you have to constantly move the camera to follow your subject. The image stabilization on the TX7 is much better and doesn't constantly go out of focus. The TX100v has slightly better low light performance. The TX100v doesn't wash out the subjects in bright sunlight and handles back light situations well. The TX7 washes out certain subjects in bright sunlight and handles the back light well in some situations and not so well in others but still ok. The TX100v takes a few seconds to start up from the time you turn on the camera and takes a few seconds for the video to start recording after touching the record icon. The TX7 takes 1 second to turn on and video recording starts instantly when the shutter is pressed or when the record icon is touched. You can only start recording by touching the record icon on the TX100v and stop recording by touching the record icon again or by closing the cover. On the TX7 you can start recording by pressing the shutter and touching the record icon and stop recording by pressing the shutter, touching the record icon again or by closing the cover. The TX100v zooms slightly slower than the TX7. Both cameras can record continuously for up to 29 minutes but splits the video files if it exceeds 2gb. The TX100v has better audio quality since is has a Dolby stereo microphone. The TX7 has a simple stereo mic which is not bad but doesn't handle loud noise well at concerts. The touch screen on the TX100v can be bit unresponsive at times causing you to touch the icon a few times before it actually responds. The TX7's touch screen is very responsive. Both cameras use the same NP-BN1 battery and the battery life (45-50 minutes)is about the same in both cameras when fully charged. The TX7 includes a wall charger but takes about 4 hours to fully charge the battery. The TX100v includes an USB charger for in camera charging and fully charges an hour faster. You can find a used or refurbished Sony charger on Amazon for around $10-20 bucks that fully charges the battery in 2 hours and 25 minutes. The still picture quality and scene setting features are better on the TX100v. The TX100v a good choice if it's your first Cyber-shot for casual use. If you already own the TX7 or TX9 then it's not worth the upgrade. I decided to stick with the TX7 and returned the TX100v. Hopefully the next gen is worth the upgrade.Update 8/30/2013I ended up buying it again a few months later because it has the best video quality out of the cyber-shot TX series to date. The picture and video quality is better the the TX200v which is supposed to be an updated model to the TX100v.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best of the bunch", "Author": "J. Maxwell", "ReviewID": "R1ZG8PX5FTGGRW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best of the current batch of cameras using the Exmor R CMOS.  The shutter delay is negligible.  A previous reviewer mentioned the movie mode button.  There is a movie button but this just starts recording a movie according to the current movie settings (incredibly flexible up to 1080 P 60 fps). This lets you skip a step and just begin shooting video.  during video shooting you can grab a still photo without interupting the video by pressing the normal exposure button. If you use maximum settings and all the bells and whistles you will create gorgeous still photos even in backlight conditions and video files that are remarkable especially if you use a small tripod to hold the camera by a stem.  The macro feature is amazing with the Carl Zies lens.  If you're interested in 3D get your own apartment first and move out of your mothers basement.  The files created with 16 mp are huge and eat battery so you'll need lots of storage and batteries for a trip and perhaps one of the new USB3 card readers (5GB/sec) to download.  Remember that HF video files cannot be stored or played from DVD's, you need a blu ray writer, they are cheap now.  When I don't want to lag my Cannon SLR and lenses around, I still get remarkable images and video and the ability to shoot stills in 16:9 makes adding photos to my videos a pleasure.JM", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just a really quick review", "Author": "Liquid Sky", "ReviewID": "R2C3KT4245IAVO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a few days now and here are my thoughts:The Good:1) Fantastic pictures with very good low-light handling and fast start-up (around 1 sec).2) Very easy movie mode. You just press the movie button on the touchscreen to start/stop. No fumbling through menus. The video quality is excellent as well, and you can record in both MP4 and the finer MTS (AVCHD). Audio is pretty decent and in stereo.3) You can take pictures (sans flash) while recording videos.4) The OLED screen is really detailed and impressive.5) The panorama shots are easy to perform and very cool. I LOVE this feature.6) The camera gets charged by connecting it to the USB (no need to take the battery out).7) The touch focus (tap where you want to focus) and touch zoom during review (zooms in where you tap) are nice features.8) Aesthetically speaking it's a pretty camera.The Bad:1) The touchscreen isn't all that great. It is resistive and not capacitive so I guess that explains it. I also have the Samsung ST600 with a 3.5\" capacitive touchscreen and it is so much more responsive in comparison.2) The cover is a pain to open. This is my first Sony camera with the push down cover so I don't know if all the others have been this way, but it seems more difficult than it needs to be. You have to push it down DIRECTLY from the top or you won't have any luck, and if you take a close look at the cover there really isn't much top. I'm not kidding about this. If you have fat fingers (and I don't) it may be even harder for you.3) Access to the HDMI port is just a plastic clip held in place with a cheap rubber attachment. For the price of the camera they should have hinged it like a door.4) It only has 4 language settings (English, French, Spanish, Japanese) unlike some cameras that have practically every language you can think of. Not a big deal but I would have thought Sony would have provided more in case you needed the option.In conclusion, I guess I would buy it again despite the negatives. It's not perfect and it's definitely overpriced in my opinion, but it's also a nice well-protected little camera that you can just take along anywhere for great pictures or HD videos on the fly.The HDMI is a mini type C connection if you'd like to order that along with the camera. The case that is recommended by Sony for this camera is model# LCS-TWK (which currently comes in black, pink and blue). I have one and it's really nice, although it does add some bulk to the whole camera package.This isn't an extensive review, but I just wanted to throw some quick comments in there since I don't see many reviews anywhere for this particular model. I may add more info later when I've had more time with it.[MORE - 2011/04/20]I'm not a professional photographer by any means so I really can't comment on any professional aspects of photography when it comes to this camera. I can say that it takes excellent pictures and videos as far as I'm concerned. I had a chance to watch the video hooked up to a large screen TV via HDMI and I was thoroughly impressed! I'm not going to post any sample videos here but you can find some on youtube and they look just as gorgeous. I'm very happy with its capability in that regard. Also, the zoom while taking videos is smooth and SILENT! (not the audio, the zoom motor is really quiet). The colors are rich and the shots are crisp, and I must repeat how incredibly well this camera handles low-light conditions (particularly in videos because obviously you can't utilize the flash in that mode). On the downside, it does takes approximately 3 full seconds for the video to start recording after you've pressed the record button. That seems a bit slow to me.I don't have a 3D TV so I'm not able to test that feature, but there's also this thing called Sweep Multi Angle that works like the panorama shot. The final product is a kind of moving picture that changes perspective as you tilt the camera left and right. I laughed the first time I saw that! It's just an extra fun thing you can do until the novelty wears off I guess.The biggest negative I see for this camera is still the touchscreen. It doesn't seem to be all there and seems somewhat buggy. Sometimes it's hypersensitive and sometimes it just seems to lag. It does get irritating. The GUI is also sub-par. The buttons are kind of tiny and the whole interface is just rather dull. It's just not that refined. The camera does come with a stylus that you can hook to the strap and that helps a little. Also, I know that a lot of the newer cameras with accelerometers have features where you can just tilt the camera or tap it to shuffle though your shots, but this camera has none of that. It's just button presses or finger swipes (and the finger swipe doesn't work that well).And speaking of fingers... because of the placement of the lens I seem to be getting my finger in the shot rather easily ^_^.  I guess I need to start holding the camera differently or something.The thing I do like a lot is the form factor. When it's closed it feels rock solid and protected. That along with its amazing pictures and videos and its unique features makes this camera worthwhile for me. I just wish it came with a capacitive touchscreen (like iphones and droids). That would make this thing totally awesome. But if you don't have that much experience with touchscreens in general you may not notice at all, so maybe I'm being too picky. It's not a terrible touchscreen by any means, but it could be better.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Was expecting more upgrading from TX9", "Author": "B. Hayes", "ReviewID": "R3S2FP68YFDXVG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'll keep this short and sweet.  If you're stuck between the TX9 or the TX100, in my opinion, the TX9 is a better value and a better point and shoot camera.  I have both and did side by side comparisons and the TX9 takes better photos in intelligent auto mode.  I can't put my finger on it, but most of the TX100 shots are either not well focused or just too soft and fuzzy.  There is a lack of definition in photos of people and the result is inferior image quality compared to the TX9.  This is really a shame, because the TX100 does take better video.  The video on the TX100 is clearer, has better color rendition and also has better low light quality.  I didn't see a huge difference between 60p and 60i, other than file size.  Where Sony screwed up is the placement of the microphone on top of the camera.  First, it picks up too much ambient noise and second, I found myself covering the microphones with my fingers holding the camera.  Because of its small form factor, and to keep fingers out of the shot, you have to hold the camera on the extreme corners of the body to avoid covering the microphone.  The other difference I noticed is that the TX100 is slower at startup, but slightly better shot to shot than the TX9.  I just can't justify spending the money to upgrade to the TX100 because its truly not a better all-around camera than the TX9.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best of breed", "Author": "B. Preston Rich", "ReviewID": "R1YT0YMWIQ9IAU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yhe best pics are the ones you actually take. A DSLR may do a slightly better job in some respects, but lugging it everywhere with multiple lenses and crap seriously reduces your picture/movie taking ease, joy and opportunities.  I sold my DSLRs and bought this newly released one for its combination of features and portability--fits easily in my pant's pocket and is instantly ready for action at all times--I don't even carry a camera bag anymore.  This camera goes everywhere w/me and is used far more that I ever used my Nikon 7000 DSLR or even my Lumix GH1.Bottom line on this new TX100v for \"point-n-shooters\" is that this is by far the \"best of the breed.\"  Shooting in auto mode for both pics and videos is simple and produces great results regardless of lighting or sceanic conditions--no need to fool with the settings...this thing is fully automated and works perfectly nearly every time.The TX100v easily beats my prior TX7 in most all categories.  Only complaint is that if you want to join any of those those fabulous AVCHD video files you need a software editor like the free tsMuxeR (which works great, BTW).I never miss getting priceless pics or movies any longer when the grandkids start doing something special at the drop of a hat (which is often), and I'm free to literally forget about shooting settings while getting truly great pics and videos.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Newer is not always better (compare to TX9)", "Author": "Joshua M. Levine", "ReviewID": "R22W163FX2JXDH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Conclusion:The TX9 is a better camera and much cheaper.PROS:*You can finally charge via USB! This is the first Sony camera I've tried where you do not have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it. This also means that you can can bring just the cable with you and leave the bulky charger at home when you travel if you have a laptop to plug into. This is great.*HDR mode is very nice in the correct situations. In cases where there is a very bright part and a dark part in frame, this makes for great shots not otherwise possible.CONS:*Like the TX10, this camera has a quirk that sometimes forces you let go of the trigger and then press it again when you try to take a shot before the camera has \"warmed up\". This is intensely frustrating and makes me miss a lot of shots.*GPS takes a good 2-3 minutes to lock in, even when standing in an open field. This pretty much makes the GPS useless for me since I typically take my camera out, take a picture, and put it away all within a few seconds. In practice, not one of my photos had a GPS tag on it. I had to go out to a park and stand there for several minutes with the camera on to get a lock and take a picture just to make sure it was actually working.*Proprietary USB connector. What is the deal, Sony? Why can't you just use a normal USB connector? This means you need to have an extra special cable plugged into your machine, and one more thing to carry when you travel. Argh.*Lens cover is hard to slide. Unlike the slide on the TX9 which I *love*, this cover just does not go down right. Sometimes it takes two hands, and even then can be hard.Picture Quality:I spent a couple of days with the TX100 on one pocket and my old TX9 in the other pocket, shooting every picture twice in the Intelligent+ auto mode. Going though all the photos, I really can't find one where the TX100 looks better than the TX9 and there are a few where the TX9 looks noticeably better.The only case where the TX100 won is a few times I manually switched it into HDR mode for specific cases where there was a bright area in an otherwise dark shot. The HDR really does work great in these situations, but is too much of a hassle to have to manually turn on every time.Advice:Don't buy the TX100 camera.

I wanted to like it as much as my TX1 which unfortunately fell off the hood of my truck (and survived the fall at medium speed, except for the optics--and survived in the rain for 36 hours no less).  But there are several things which left me constantly frustrated using this camera during a once-in-a-lifetime trip this weekend.  To clarify, I have happily owned 4 Sony digital cameras so I am very familiar with their layout and format.  This review is based on an in-depth knowledge of how to use their products, YMMV if you are not familiar with Sony.  I found the following challenges:  1) Many of the pictures did not turn out well.  I was using the camera in strong sunlight, but mistakenly had confidence that they pictures would be ok if I aimed right.  I use the camera in Auto and in Program mode.  The focus was poor in some of them, the exposure WAY off in others.  Metering mode seemed to randomly change, but perhaps that's due to the next challenge.  2) The touch screen is too sensitive.  There were many pictures which I almost missed because my finger inadvertently brushed or even hovered above some menu option or the help menu.  In the sun it was hard to see to cancel out of these options.  Also, it was too easy to accidentally brush the video start button and start videoing when you really meant to take a still picture.  I had a TX1 which also had a touch screen (part of the reason why I chose this model over some of the other similar models) so it's not a touchscreen learning curve issue, this one is just way too sensitive.  3) The slide down lens protector which turns on the camera and exposes the lens did not always slide down easily.  There were a few pictures I almost missed because I simply could not get the camera opened without careful 2-handed interaction.  When walking around as a tourist all day with something in your hands, this was sometimes a bit of a challenge to navigate.  Again, the TX1 was the same form factor but did not behave this way.  4) The touch spot focus worked TERRIBLE.  One reason I went with the touchscreen was because I like to point to exactly where I want the focus to be.  The TX1 did this well.  The software \"enhancement\" in this camera tries to \"intelligently\" decide what you are trying to focus on, which means it moves around randomly--often not at all where you want it to focus.  This led to much frustration.  To note, I operate the camera with face and smile recognition turned off, so those features were not trying to compensate.  5) The zoom moved too fast.  Although it's only 4X, it was a little clunky in getting the zoom to move--something other reviewers of recent Sony products have noted.  There's not a very granular level of zoom unless you very delicately finesse the zoom lever.  6) Finally, when accessing pictures as a drive on my laptop (did not load the software) it constantly hung Windows Explorer so I could not copy pictures off of the memory stick to my laptop.  After 30 minutes of retrying, I simply gave up and will need to use a MS adapter plugged into another computer.What did I like?It worked with previous memory sticks that I have as well as SD cards, of which I also have several.  So there's no worry about running out of space taking only pictures (HD video of course is a whole 'nother story.)Battery life was just ok.  The camera went through heavy usage one day and needed to be recharged after only 75 pictures or so (and no video).I liked that the battery charger also regulates voltage when recharging the battery, so you can use it in a foreign country without a voltage regulator (although you still need the funky outlet adapter).  The battery charger also was very small which meant that it fits into the toe of a shoe in your suitcase.  While others have disliked that you can only recharge the battery in the camera, this wasn't a problem on this trip.  It probably would be if I had had two batteries with me and needed to recharge both overnight.The small form factor meant it fit easily into a purse pocket, so it was easy to access.Sony does great with low-light picture taking--this was true of my TX1, and true of this camera.  (At least when the exposure worked correctly on this one!)I will return this camera and replace it with one of the other models and hope it works better.

In some ways it is remarkably capable and in other ways it is so dumbed down that the needs of precision are removed and the result is unsatisfactory.Some shots are breathtakingly beautiful. Colors seem to pop and the images seem to be larger than life and richer than the actual scene. At the same time I found focus to be very soft, some distortion on the sides and lots of time taken to store photos. But what I had the most difficult time was trying to get take indoor pictures without motion blur. Even the slightest motion caused images to appear out of focus. No matter what I did, even fast shutter settings, those objects not directly in front of the camera were badly out of focus due to motion blur.The real problem is nothing can be adjusted with this expensive camera. Need a higher ISO than the automatic is giving you? Can't do it. Need a faster shutter speed? No can do. If the camera decides it's not appropriate, you're out of luck.Other frustrations - no raw image results. Everything is a JPEG. And if that isn't frustrating enough, the choices of image sizes is limited both with pictures and movies. You can only shoot in 60p - you cannot shoot in 30p or 24p and make the most of your camera's small lens. If you want to shoot in other variations other than 60i, you can only shoot in non-full HD (14400 and less) and shoot MP4 movies. Why on earth did Sony limit the variations of what we can shoot?Photos are equally frustrating. You either get 16MP (which is maybe too much for this tiny lens) and only 10MP or less. There is no choice for 12MP or 14MP, common on many other cameras. With 16:9 photos you only get 12MP and then you go down to 2MP. Nothing is in between and it's frustrating.The full motion movies are very good for a camera this small. Still I don't think it captures scenes as crisply and clearly as a regular HD camera that has a larger lens and even just 30p. I think it does a much better job. Still, this camera's movies seem to be its strong suit - although you should know that the record/stop mode is stupidly on the touch screen -- not a hard button! There is noticeable time lag before the camera begins to record and after you press stop.The 3D can only be taken under certain circumstances. It's mostly gimmicky although it can be quite cool when it works properly.Bright sides are that the panorama mode does a very nice job. The movie mode (less than 60p recording) will also allow for lower but acceptable MP picture taking - which is very impressive.Summary: This is a very expensive camera that I couldn't get to take many good photos, except of still, non-moving objects. If you know how to use a camera to a small degree, this point and shoot will frustrate you because it is only point and shoot. You may need to shoot a LOT of pictures to make sure you don't get home to find blurring or the spots that appear as compensating for indoor lightning/darkness. If you want an OK camera with excellent movies capabilities, this might suit the bill.MESSAGE TO SONY: You desperately need to have a firmware update for this camera. Such a shame you've stupidly had the movie record button as a soft button (use the playback button) and stripped out all the meaningful controls even lower end cameras should have.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "HERMAN PI\u00d1EREZ", "ReviewID": "R3RKC205P1MHOH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent camera, the first shipment arrived with a manufacturing defect, not light, was reported and was replaced quickly.

Image quality is fantastic.  Added features like smile-detection and panorama are not-necessary, but cool to play with and all work great.I have been a faithful Sony camera user for years.  I take a lot of photos for work and I have found Sony's picture quality / ease-of-use ratio to be the best fit for me.  I used a P200 Cybershot for years (and still have it) and thought I should upgrade to a point-and-shoot with more features.  I mistakenly went for the DSC-W570 which was a piece of junk.  Photos were grainy, camera took way to long to start us, and lag times between pressing the shutter button, and actually taking the photo was like 4 seconds.  I traded that one for this little gem.First off, the DSC-TX100 is made in Japan. When it comes to Sony, only the Japanese stuff is worth the money.  following that, all the problems I had with the W570 - lag time, low-light quality, were not an issue with the TX100.  Finally, all of the little added features like HD video, panorama sweep, smile detection etc, are all features I could do without, but are all pretty awesome.Finally, the low-light image quality is unsurpassed in a camera this small. I rarely use my flash with this camera.And, as an added bit of usefulness, the ultimate deciding factor for me when choosing this camera was the water-proof rating for this camera.  Sure, its not going to replace a dive camera, but its nice to have a camera I can take to the beach, accidentally drop in the sand, and still use the next day.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad quality camera - broke in 6 months", "Author": "Rodrigo Fontecilla", "ReviewID": "R1WL2TFILTS8PF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after my other Sony DSC lasted more than 12 but less than 18 months.  Being a SONY fan for many years I decided to buy SONY again.  Well, this camera broke down in less than 6 months.  I thought once I talk to SONY customer support they will send me a new one.  To my surprise the fine print said I was not entitled to one and that was it.  They fixed it after 4 weeks.  So now instead of having a new camera I have a repaired used one.  The camera essentially went black on me. Since there is no view finder you cannot use the camera once this happens.  The previous SONY camera had the same problem, it went black on me only a bit past the warranty time.  My suggestion is avoid SONY cameras or at least this style of cameras.  Customer service is pretty bad as well.  Big companies should learn a thing or two from comanies like Nodstrom and Apple where customer service is their number one priority. If SONY would value customers like me they would have hesitated in sending me a new camera and keep me a happy customer.

Why? the bloody instructions (loosely termed) are on a CD in web page (HTML) format.But then why bother...the English is so poor that it must be a Babelfish translation (\"Making camera on be so kind as lifting hood cover...\") -- a fictional stretch, but you get the idea. So even after you've put this gobbledygook on your PC (you have a PC, don't you?? Can't tell the players without a PC-based program...), you're not going to get far.Oh, sure. There's a \"getting started\" booklet with the camera that tells you where to put the battery, how to charge it and even rudimentary picture making and playback info. But after that, you're Peter Sellers doing battle with a hidden Kato.I know, I know -- everybody's leaving out the user's guide. With miniaturization like it is, the bubble-pak packaging would have to double in size to contain a decent book, and we can't have big trucks hauling the emulsified corpses of all those decapitated trees around. Besides, someone human (oh, please...) would have to ponder how to convey that information, and those jobs were long since outsourced. So we've all decided to bite the cyber-bullet and live with this kind of \"up yours, customer\" marketing.Well, for me, it's asking too much. So I rate this camera as a loser for that reason alone. $350 for a complicated piece of equip. with no worthy user information is sheer garbage.Oh, we'll keep it and learn to live with it.
