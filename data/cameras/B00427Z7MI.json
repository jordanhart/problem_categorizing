{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Upgraded from a K100D and K2000 to a K-r.  It's awesome.", "Author": "James Lin", "ReviewID": "R3JLSCQSJ2C4MZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Over the past four years, I've owned an *ist DL, a K100D and a K2000.  The new Pentax K-r feels like a huge improvement over its already excellent predecessors.NEW FEATURES:The most obvious improvements are the great new features.  The K-r now has a dedicated focus assist lamp.  In short, it's unintrusive compared to a strobing popup flash and it works great.  I can't believe it took Pentax this long to give us this feature.The K-r also supports both a proprietary lithium ion battery and AA batteries.  You'll have to find a special adapter to use AA batteries though.  Unfortunately, Pentax didn't bundle the adapter with the body.K-x users will also be familiar with the in-camera HDR feature.  The K-r includes several HDR settings including auto, standard, strong 1, strong 2, and strong 3.  HDR mode is easily accessed by pressing the Info button.Movie mode is available once again, but it's still not particularly robust.  You can shoot in 720p at 25fps, which is an odd frame rate.  AF isn't available while you're shooting, but I've found that manual focusing is easy enough with the right lens.  I didn't have any problems with my FA 35mm.Auto white-balancing is greatly improved over the K100D and the K2000 also.  You can now shoot in tungsten light without having to manually set the WB.  No more horribly yellow photos indoors followed by extremely blue photos outdoors when you forget to white balance again!Finally, my favorite new feature is the selectable 11-point AF.  When it's enabled, you can press the OK button to bring up the point selection interface and use the arrow keys to select your focus point.  When you're done, press and hold the OK button to close the menu so you can use the arrow keys for other shortcuts again.INTERFACE:With each new release, Pentax's interface has improved and the K-r is no exception.  For people coming from the older *ist DL and K100D bodies, you'll immediately notice that the four arrow buttons now have double purposes.  Instead of pressing FN + right to get to the ISO menu, you just need to press the right arrow button.  Users of the K2000 will find the interface very familiar, but still improved. The Info button now brings up the grid of commonly used settings such as HDR modes, JPG/RAW, metering settings, AF mode, etc.  Each setting is represented with an icon or text label and moving the cursor over the setting allows you to quickly cycle through the different modes using the dial.  It's similar to pressing the OK button the K2000, but now with more options and fewer button presses.When you preview your last JPG photo, you also get the option to save it as raw.  This only works with the last photo taken, probably because the camera only stores the raw data for one photo at a time.  This is a great feature for those who prefer to shoot in JPG and still occasionally use raw.BUILD QUALITY:The build quality of the K-r is as solid as every previous Pentax dSLR body that I've owned.  The battery compartment latch is slightly improved over the K2000 and the K100D.  It's a little hard to describe the new latch, but it's easy to use and much harder to accidentally open.PERFORMANCE:I loved the low light performance of my K100D and I enjoyed the newer interface and faster AF of my K2000.  The K-r again gets the best of both worlds with very clean photos at ISO 1600 and even faster and more decisive autofocus.  It's also now capable of shooting at 6fps in continuous mode.OVERALL:The Pentax K-r has really exceeded my expectations.  The improved performance combined with the new features makes the K-r a joy to use.  It's an excellent entry-level dSLR that it will satisfy even more seasoned photographers who want a compact spare body.", "Date": "November 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Upgraded from a K-2000, the K-R Rules", "Author": "Aldo R. Perez \"aldorp\"", "ReviewID": "R1S939XCWO4BEO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from the Pentax K-2000 to the Pentax K-R.  I have only had the camera a few days but I already have a good impression.First, the LCD display is good, really good.  A huge upgrade from the one on the Pentax K-2000.  With this screen it is easy to verify the right focus, love it.The camera is very fast.  Fast at focusing, talking the pictures and fast going through the menus.  Now, activate some of the special features like filters or lens distortion correction and things slow down.  I think it is a fair exchange.The camera brings a new battery that last a LONG time.  In theory you could use AA batteries but you need a $35.00 adapter that the camera did not bring.  I'm not going to spend $35 for an adapter, I would rather pay for another battery for that money.  Pentax dropped the ball on this one.The visible focus points make a BIG difference.  I had defaulted the K-2000 to center only focusing to avoid problems.  I had been doing this for so long that I didn't realize how useful it would be to have an 11 point focus system.  This is a big improvement.Live view is a LOT faster than the reviews give it credit for.  I had NO PROBLEMS telling people to pose and using the face recognition in live view to take the picture.  Once you focus it does a zoom in on the focus point for a second.  I like the feature as it lets me verify focus.The biggest surprise was the low light capabilities of the camera.  I can shoot at ISO 1600 without having to worry about noise.  Even if I shoot RAW there is not much noise to talk about at ISO 1600.  ISO 3200 is still very usable and with some Photoshop using Raw files they are easy to make usable for 8 X 11 pictures.  The K-R is a HUGE improvement from the K-2000 in this area.Build and Handling:  It feels just like a K-2000 and from the outside it has few differences.  The biggest change was the menus as they have been GREATLY improved making finding and changing settings very easy.  The camera is still noisy and in a quiet environment it will be noticed as you take the picture.  Since I shoot a lot in Church environments I would have rather have a silent camera.Low Point: The video is not really a big feature.  Mono sound, you can only record up to 20 minutes as the sensor heats up too much, 25 fps, no automatic refocus, no aperture control after the movie starts.  In short, don't buy the K-R for the movie mode, that is just a basic feature in the camera.  Live view is the REAL improvement.So I find the K-R a very good upgrade from the K-2000.  The pictures look great and the low light pictures are excellent.  Only two issues are the basic video feature and the lack of the AA adapter in the package.  The fast focus, fast shooting, improve LCD, visible focus points, amazing low light pictures and live view make the K-R a great upgrade for K-2000 users.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Can Find No Fault", "Author": "photogeezer", "ReviewID": "RNV217TXH25FM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a Canon 5DII shooter needing a compact SLR for hiking or backup on trips I got a good deal on this K-r and immediately set out to find fault with it. I had the box ready to send it back. My nitpicking was in vain; I like this little guy!I let my Pentax K20D go to my son to get more pics of the grandkids out of him, leaving me without a Pentax body. I already own a couple of Pentax digital lenses, and I thought that a compact DSLR was preferable to holding a miniature camera out like a baby with a dirty diaper to compose, or dealing with one of several miserable electronic viewfinders.The K-r has a bigger, clearer LCD screen than the K20D, image quality is noticeably better in the shadows than the K20D, and the penta-mirror optical viewfinder competes well with its CaNikon peers (at this price level). The ergonomics fit me fine, and the interface is very simple. In fact, I am familiar with Canon and Nikon SLR's and I find the Pentax interface to be straightforward and well thought-out. LiveView is very smooth in use, and is a great help in focusing a manual-focus lens, such as for macro use.Unlike my Canon 5D2, proper exposure reads in the middle, without any under- or overexposure that I can see. If colors look too cartoonish for you, simply select the Natural jpg mode. As other reviewers say, there IS a tendency to blow out strong highlights. If the picture is that important to you, shoot RAW and be extra careful. Setting minus Exposure Compensation and processing for the highlights (Adobe Camera RAW) should not cause noisy shadows with the K-r.  Set the K-r to shoot your RAWs in the DNG format, and do your processing in ACR. In my testing, hot spots in the scene, such as a sunlit white wall, really do show up hot. You must adjust for that with ANY camera. Also, you will have SOME blown specular highlights with any digital camera in some situations. Finally, use at least a Class 6 card, or it'll be slow writing to the card.In summary, the K-r is compact (especially with the DA 21 or DA 70 pancake lenses) and competent. It's a pleasure to carry around in a small bag. It is feather-light without being at all flimsy. Great buys in Pentax lenses for the K-r include the new 35mm f2.4, the old FA 35mm f2, the F and FA 50's, and the F and FA 28's. The 55-300 tele zoom is decent, but don't expect Canon L performance ($350 lens vs $1,200). If you MUST have a zoom, an excellent choice would be Tamron's 17-50 f 2.8. The Tammie is significantly better than the Pentax kit zoom, which is, in turn, not junk, just a cheap zoom. Don't shell out for the Tamron Image Stabilization; get the non-IS version. You already have in-body IS with the K-r.The Pentax K5, for double the money, gets you a brighter viewfinder, better weather-sealing, better high ISO images and bigger files. At about $550, The K-r is a good buy. You can expect the price to come down even more as the next \"latest and greatest\" comes out.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pentax quality control problems", "Author": "John149823 \"John\"", "ReviewID": "R31EEDGZW9UGRJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ordered this camera from Emmy Photo.  The original camera that I was sent had the light meter calibration off by more than 2 stops.  Sent back and promptly received a replacement unit.  The LED display on this second unit began to fail within a matter of weeks.  Emmy will not take back the second camera, so am sending back to Pentax.Note added in postscript: I contacted Pentax today regarding warranty service, and was told that I was responsible for shipping and insurance costs sending this unit back to them for repairs.  I was further told that I should expect turnaround of up to 4 weeks.When I requested free shipping and exchange for a new unit given that I had been sent two defective units in a row, I was told that \"this is not Pentax's warranty policy\".", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "AF Fix Using Free Software", "Author": "Dong Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R3S5Y9CJZ6ZPWV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "From the factory, the K-r front focusing was really bad (tested 3 lens: 18-55mm f3.5-5.6, 28-90mm f3.5-5.6, and 35mm f2.4). I had to AF Fine Adjust to -10. I then found a nifty app called PK_Tether, which allows you to put Pentax cameras (K-x, K7, K5, K-r, K20D, K10D, K200) into debug mode. That enables you to get to the Debug menu and do AF calibration. I am not sure what the max is but I went as high as -19. You would want to reset the AF Fine Adjustment to 0 before using the calibration. That way you can do fine adjustment from the calibrated setting.Other than the front focusing issue, the K-r could use the individual AF fine adjustment setting for up to 20 lens feature available on the K7 and K5. Otherwise, the K-r is a great camera with the fix mentioned above.", "Date": "May 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Camera, mediocre focusing", "Author": "John Babits", "ReviewID": "R3UR21UFBY9BBH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was in the market for my first \"real\" digital SLR, and after doing a lot of research settled on the Pentax K-r. The specs are amazing for a camera with this price, and the capabilities are endless. I tried it in the store and was quite impressed with the performance. If you use Live View you can make changes to the White Balance and see them right on the screen, a prerequisite for me. Rather than the Pentax \"kit\" 300mm lens, I opted for a Sigma 70-300mm since it appeared to be a better lens. I also had a couple of Ricoh cameras with an assortment of lenses, and they fit the Pentax mount no problem.Under ideal conditions, this camera takes amazing pictures. I believe the sensor is the same Sony sensor used in more expensive Nikons, so the color is very good. Image sharpness is also very good...however...This camera appears to have a problem with the autofocus. As I said, in ideal conditions, photos are amazing with either the stock lens, the Sigma lens or a Tamron AF lens I purchased later. If you try to push it in low-light conditions, the focus goes off a bit and results are slightly less than spectacular. While colors stay as sharp as ever, sometimes the focusing program just can't seem to get it right. I have lost some good shots because of this, so I have learned to shoot, adjust, shoot again, adjust and shoot again. As long as the subject stays where you want, you WILL get a decent image. If it's a once in a lifetime shot, be prepared. Also, when using older manual focus lenses, the focus assistant doesn't seem to get it quite right all the time. The better the light, the more accurate the focus. Except for this one fault, I am well pleased with this camera. When you do get a good shot, it is magnificent, considering you've saved $150-250 over a Canon and $200-300 over a comparable Nikon.I have heard that there are split image focusing screens available for this camera, and since I have a lot of manual focus lenses I am going to try this as a solution. Replacing the focus screen is a simple three step process, and if it makes my shots clearer it is well worth it. Thankfully you won't have to pay developing fees to see if the shot came out clearly...If you are an amateur and just want to take standard shots, this is a great camera. If you are a little more professional, be aware of the focusing issue and be prepared. This would be a good 'bag camera' for those shots you want to get off quickly and don't want to pull out a $2500+ camera. Also, since it uses the same Pentax mount as all cameras back to the K1000, lenses are all over the place for low $$$. This fact alone makes this a good camera for an occasional photographer that wants decent shots from a mid priced camera.", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera", "Author": "HR", "ReviewID": "R3EYXU6GO7UN88", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this because of the price, along with knowing that my used *ist D bodies wouldn't last forever.  Now that was a nice, high-quality camera, with an honest-to-goodness pentaprism rather than this cheap pentamirror nonsense, and with a very well laid-out set of controls.  Plus it had an LCD readout on top, something I really miss with the dim viewfinder of the K-R.Like an idiot, I bought several Pentax film bodies and (mostly used) lenses, just before digital became the norm.  Mind you, I love digital.  It's like having a Polaroid that actually takes decent pictures, but doesn't cost an arm an a leg for film (plus development and printing with 35mm).Fortunately Pentax digitals allow me to use all my Pentax film lenses, with a crop factor of 1.5, which means my 20mm lens gives me roughly the field of view of my 28mm lens on 35mm film, which is plenty wide for my needs (hardly ever used the 20 on film).  Also, fortunately, the bodies still allow fully manual operation.  All those scene settings, HDR, and what-not mean nothing to me.  I just put 'er on manual, set the meter to spot, and take pictures.This camera, like the older bodies, produces great images.  I use the RAW format exclusively, which allows me a lot of latitude during conversion to other file formats on the computer.Truth is, I would be just as happy if this was a 6-megapixel body though the trend is for bigger is better in general these days (remember that a 35mm negative used to be considered miniature and is, compared to roll or sheet film).  Images from the 6 megapixel bodies can easily be enlarged to 11x14, or larger, if the camera is held steady.  I rarely crop severely and enlarge, so that's not an issue for me.  And, I doubt that a puny 12 megapixels would make all that much difference in that regard anyway.Screen size is a much-overhyped feature in my opinion.  A larger screen draws more current and runs the batteries down faster.  I use the screen only to set menu items.  I learned early on that the picture on that screen is only a rough approximation to what the image actually looks like, particularly in terms of exposure, on the computer or when printing.  Plus, for all the talk to the contrary, they are difficult to see in sunlight.  The little *ist D screen was perfectly readable.  I'd prefer a smaller screen on the K-R, which would allow the buttons to be placed further from the right edge of the body.  As it is, I often find that I have inadvertently changed ISO or some other setting on the four-way controller, which the K-R uses for quick access to certain menu items, a good idea if the screen was smaller and the controller nearer the center of the back ...One thing I really don't like is the larger file size from the greater number of pixels, roughly twice the size of a RAW *ist D file, after both are converted to Adobe's dng format (roughly 6 vs 13 megabytes for a RAW file).  But, that's just the way it is.  I don't like gas-guzzling SUVs either, and anyone can see how much good that did me.All in all, it's a nice camera.  Does what I want it to do, if I'm careful to make sure I haven't bumped the four-way controller that is.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Basic DSLR", "Author": "Batgirl", "ReviewID": "RSADUE764XIJ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had to find a new digital camera fast when my old Pentax died at the beginning of a photography class. I loved my *istD and am still hoping I can get it fixed. The Pentax K-R is good camera. I like the larger LCD screen on the back and the hand grip seems to be improved from my old camera. It has most of the same features as my other camera with some nice updates. The high-speed action mode is really fast. I'm not sure how I lived without it before! The menu is easy to navigate and the live preview comes in handy. I never thought I would like the ability to capture video, but I really like that feature. A couple things I really miss from my old camera are the cable switch outlet, the ability to reset file numbering, and having the control knobs on separate sides of the camera. I constantly hit the camera mode dial, changing the setting by accident. The white balance options allow you to tweak the settings, however, I have a lot of trouble getting the white balance correct for a particular situation now. My old Pentax had limited white balance settings, but I usually kept it on auto with perfect results. Not this camera. Without the cable switch, I had to buy the remote for this camera.Some words of advice, buy the AA battery adaptor along with an extra rechargeable battery when you purchase this camera. You cannot use regular batteries without the adaptor. Depending on how many pictures you take and whether you use the live view mode, the camera battery may not last as long as you think it might. I am a photography student who shoots A LOT of pictures. After the first day of using the camera, the rechargeable battery was dead. I was setting up the camera and trying out the live view, which consumes A LOT of power, as well as taking a ton of pictures.Overall, I think this camera is a good DSLR. Pentax makes quality products. This is my third Pentax camera and I will buy a Pentax the next time I buy a new camera. I was disappointed with some of the features that were not included on this camera, but Pentax does offer those features on the higher end camera. I have taken over 3000 pictures on this camera in the short time I have had it. It functions well, is well built and is fairly light weight. The hand grip makes it easy to carry around with one hand. Compare features between this camera and the higher end Pentax first to make sure you won't be missing something you use. If you are a beginner, this camera will be more than enough to get you started. If you are an advanced photographer, it is a matter of features and your budget.

I had thought about changing brands, but the economics of replacing my lenses did not make sense.  HOWEVER, this K-r camera has very good photo quality.  It is more user friendly than it's predecessor and the ergonomics seemed to be well thought out. It has a very large preview screen, easy to manipulate around the menu screens and lots of options.

It is quite small and lightweight.  The low light capabilities of this DLSR are amazing.  It is as if the camera can see in the dark without a flash.  The included Li-Ion battery is long lived.  In a pinch, you can even fall back on AA batteries (provided you buy the separate adapter).  I could go on and on, but...  The front focus problem on K-r's is real.In case you haven't heard, low light photography under tungsten light (standard light bulbs) will produce incredibly fuzzy photos.  If you shoot outside, or with a flash, then you will probably never notice.  If you bought the camera because you most frequently shoot indoors like I do, then this is a major problem.  It is wide spread and (from what I've seen and read) you have a 75%+ chance of having this issue if you buy at this time.  The one I bought from Amazon had this problem.  It took Pentax 4 months to even acknowledge the issue.  Rumor has it that Pentax is working to fix the issue with a firmware update.  I have my fingers crossed.  If the firmware update resolves the issue, then I will revise my rating to 5 stars.I believe in the Pentax brand, they have once again become innovators in the photography industry and buyers can enjoy much more value for their dollar, so I will wait a few more months for the firmware.  If that doesn't pan out, then I will warranty-repair the camera.  If that still doesn't work, I will sell the camera at a loss and probably go with the proven K-x until such time as someone comes up with a truly viable micro 4/3 or other EVIL camera.

Had to buy a lens, strap, battery adapter, lithium battery pack, battery charger, USB cable, and case.  Also had to download the user manual online.  Almost worth paying extra to get the entire kit at WalMart for $599, if it wasn't for the tax.  Since there is no battery or adapter, I cannot complete my review until all the stuff comes in.  I just hope it works because I've been dying to use the lens from my old K1000.  Will complete this review later.  Just thought you'd want to know about all the necessary accessories.  Also, I've been looking for cases.  the best deal I've found for a good, safe, padded case is at WalMart in the sporting goods section.  There is a nice case with 3 extra pockets that is a padded cooler for 12 cans of pop.  $9.95Finally got lithium battery.  New problem:  Shutter keeps flapping when I pressed the live view 'LV' button and wouldn't stop.  Almost sent everthing back.  Couldn't find a solution to the problem.  Put on a lens from my old K1000, and no problem.  Only had a problem with new DA lens that comes with the K-r kit (18-55).  After searching for a solution for several days, someone suggested cleaning the lens and camera contacts.  Completely solved the problem.  Another problem:  Camera has problems with autofocus in low light.  That seems to be the only downside so far.  Picture quality is outrageous.  Crystal clear and razor sharp.  Not much to hang onto, so I will attach my old handlebar that attaches to the base.  Old pentax k1000 20-200 lens functioned with no problems.  Best thing, my 3x adapter also works, so now I can shoot 60-600.  Still kinda grainy thru the lens like it was with the k1000.  A million different options, but I'll think I'll have fun with this camera.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12.4-megapixel CMOS sensor; compact, lightweight body\nBody only; lenses sold separately\nWidescreen 720p HD video at 25fps; powerful automatic shooting modes including Pentax Auto Picture\n3-inch LCD with 921,000 dots of resolution; wide range of in-camera image processing and special effects filters\nCapture images and video to SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Pentax K-r 12.4 MP Digital SLR Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Black Body)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PzQEeDCiL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00427Z7MI"}}
