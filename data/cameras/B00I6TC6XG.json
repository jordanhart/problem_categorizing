{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing camera -  D800 replacement?", "Author": "Waikiki", "ReviewID": "R2UFUWT71VRQZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many folks, I pre-ordered the D800 the same day it was available.  Alas, Nikon totally blew the market analysis vs production vs. supply chain formula.  After waiting 2 months, I had to leave the country before Nikon got it's D800 act together. I needed a beat-up D90 replacement camera, and the D3200 seemed like a decent place-holder.  I quickly ordered one before they were back-ordered too!  Sure, the D3200 is DX, not FX.  Sure, it is not nearly as flexible.  Sure, it can only AF with newer lenses.  BUT, you can buy about 4-D3200's for the price of a D800, AND it comes with a decent kit lens for $699!The tutoring graphical-based menu system is geared more to beginners, which I am not, so I find it maddening.  Most will love it, since it is somewhat educational, and offers a great variety of pre-sets to take creative shots easily.It is amazingly light weight - lighter than most lenses! It is very quiet. The AF could be faster, but it's plenty fast enough. When you dig deeper, you shockingly find that the D3200 has many advanced internal features from the highest-end cameras (D800 & F4). The high-res LCD rear screen, the EXPEED 3 image processing engine, and a new 24MP sensor.  The EXPEED 3 image processing engine allows the D3200 to perform at an altitude unheard of for a so-called entry level camera.  Nikon's Active-D dynamic range enhancement at 24MP at 4 frames per second requires substantial in-camera processing power.I bought this camera primarily for still photography. With the proper lenses & technique, the results are stunning.  Low-light/high ISO performance is far beyond what you should expect at this level camera. Candle-lit face images are noise-free, and look great. Still life's on a tripod at ISO 100, have more resolution that ANY DSLR I have ever used, with very little shadow noise.  In short, I might not accept my D800 when it becomes available.  I might use the D3200 longer than I thought, (waiting for the 24MP FX D600 for $1999 later this year -- my guesses on price & stats & date)...or, just keep using the D3200.  If it breaks (I'm hard on cameras), I'll just buy a new one.Bottom line -- the D3200: super light-weight, very quiet, super high resolution (& low noise, high dynamic range, superb colors), incredible HD video with slow motion.  It is no doubt THE most amazing DSLR value on the planet!5/14/12 UPDATE: I've now shot 100s of images, using lenses from 11 mm to 600 mm.  I've learned a lot.  Super-high resolution cameras are a new arena for most of us. On the surface, one automatically thinks you will get images with twice the resolution (12MP vs 24MP). Not so.  MP resolution is measured linearly, so the increase while significant, is less than doubled.  More importantly, when you enter the hi-res camera stratosphere, photographic technique & lens choice are critical. While these high MP cameras are capable of amazing results, you have to work to get absolutely ALL the MP's this camera has to offer.  Do not blame the camera if your initial results are less dramatically sharper than your old 6-8-12MP Nikon. It's probably you...BTW, the Nikon 18-55mm is a decent lens, but it doesn't do this imager justice.  You can get better results, with better glass.  The excellent f1.8 35mm DX Nikon on this camera makes a super-light weight compact package you can carry all day long, producing super images.  A 60 year-old Nikkor Q 200mm f4, $70 or so on eBay, produces stunning results if carefully used on Manual, on a tripod.Set-up a table with clean background and a few artifacts on it.  Use the sharpest lens you have,  at f 8, on a sturdy tripod, perpendicular to the table, Shoot the scene with the in-camera flash on both old & new camera bodies. You will see the difference easily when images from both cameras are compared side by side, enlarged to 100%.How does this translate to everyday casual shooting?  Not easily. Sub-par technique still results in sub-par images no matter what camera is used.  If you are a beginner looking for the best entry-level DSLR ever made, all of this won't matter -- grab a D3200 and shoot away!  Just note that the D3200 is capable of world-class imagery.  If it takes more effort to take photographs of this caliber, it's a good thing -- the D3200 forces you to up your game to get there!5/5/13 UPDATE.  It's been a year.  I have a D800 and a D3200.  Yes, there are many differences between the two.  One is at the high end of the spectrum, the other, entry level.  When I'm shooting commercially, or seriously in any way, it's the D800.  It is a superb camera, if you own glass that can fully exploit the 36MP sensor, and your technique is solid. For everything else, I use the D3200.  Why?  It's light and compact.  You can easily carry it around all day, with the f1.8 35mm, and hardly know it's there.  If that lens isn't wide enough, shoot a 3-frame series and stitch them together in Photoshop.  Again, with good glass and technique, the results are very, very good.  D800 territory? No, but few would notice. The D3200 is a pleasure to use, and handles fast enough for most kinds of photography. You can use old manual Nikkor lenses easily, albeit with a bit more effort.  With the focus confirmation dot in the viewfinder, manual focusing is easy.  Exposure can be guessed and adjusted using the great hi-res LCD.  I recently had to shoot an emergency-rush job covering a politician's speech. All I had in the car was the D3200, the 35mm f1.8, and an old, sharp 100mm f2.8 E Nikkor  -- my normal in-car-at all-times stash.  The setting was indoors, in a bright garden area -- no flash allowed.  I was surrounded by folks with Nikon D4's and $1500 lenses.  I got a few looks....LOL.  I boosted the ISO to 1600, used the $50 100mm @ f4 @1/125th, and the results were great, published in several places.  The D3200 is a great camera for the money, I like it more now than when I first bought it!", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Baby D800 ??", "Author": "scs_13", "ReviewID": "R1G4A261F3H5RK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had no plans to buy this camera, but eventually had to find a solution while waiting for my D800 to be delivered. I kind of felt, I could get some training by shooting high megapixel images on this entry level camera.My first outing after the camera arrived was to some birdpark with absolutely no prior preparation. The manual is still in the box, only charged the battery overnight and brought a selection of lenses in addition to the kit lens.First surprise, even the kit \"plastic\" lens performs really nicely on this camera. Due to the nature of the objects of interest, the remaining shoots were done on a 28-300mm.I was accompanied by an experienced bird photographer and we took turns with the camera. Both made the following observations: From the angle of experienced Nikon users, this camera offers everything in terms of menus and dials to set the camera up the way one is used to from D90, D7000, D300s level cameras. This came as a surprise, as the D3200 does not have the front dial that we both were used to and familiar with. Nikon has done an surprisingly good job in making the menus very easy to access and after a short while, we where entirely concentrated on the shoot and only occasionally reminding ourself that this was \"only\" an entry-level DSLR.At the same time, we were impressed how nice the software is tailored to the needs of a potential beginner, gently guiding him towards to goal of making better photos along the way.The LCD screen on the back is a huge step forward from previous models, as it allowed to effortless pre-screen the shots taken. I was even carrying a laptop computer to better inspect the initial images, but after a short while we only resorted the the built-in screen.The biggest surprise was however the image quality after we analyzed our initial >350 photos on a large monitor. The yield of usable photos was right out of the box very high, which reiterates the ease of use of this camera and the great auto-focus system (despite only 11 sensors). Also the smallish size of the body turned out to be less problematic, even with a bigger lens attached to it.We found the image quality obtained to be absolutely stunning, the sharpness of the images was \"picture perfect\". Colors just the way one would expect them, as is the hall mark of any Nikon camera. Even small birds could be cropped from the 24 MP resulting in usable 7 MP images. Post-processing was a thrill and resulted in a substantial number of images clearly qualifying as publication quality.Having seen both, the best and the worst in Nikon cameras, I can verify that this entry level DSLR is a keeper. Even though never planned, it will stay in the collection as a second body and now serves as the main camera until the D800 arrives.If an entry level camera already is this good, what may be expected of the upcoming updates of the other DX models, the likes of D5100, D7000 and the D300s?", "Date": "May 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid performer for the price.", "Author": "Dwegs \"Dwegs\"", "ReviewID": "R3PHW5WX9WXBKY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I only really purchased this as a studio cam. Don't need AF performance for that, nor high ISO's, but do need great resolution. So, with trepidation and reserve, I decided to try this one. I am coming from D700's, D3's, D7k's and other as my point of reference. I shoot for a living.The good:Resolution is excellent, especially when coupled with the 40mm macro from Nikon. I have shot a few hundred shots now and am very happy in that regard. The menus are simple enough that you can work them out if you already know Nikon's systems for menus. AF performance is great for this kind of body. Using my 17-55 with it, I could acquire focus only slightly slower that with the D7000. I tried in lower light to see how that worked, and while you could tell it was slower, it was not too bad. Every shot I have taken bar one (black dog in a dark room), was in focus as intended. So, AF is good for this kind of body. I like the layout of the controls too, everything was where it was expected to be.The bad:Small body means uncomfortable grip. However, that is what was expected, so I don't really think this is a \"bad\" for this camera. I expect a person with smaller hands will thoroughly enjoy that aspect. Lenses (all but smaller ones) are front heavy and fell off balance. Pop a 70-200 VR on this and it is silly unless you carry/hold it by the lens primarily. Lastly, there is no AF fine tune, but.... I have not found the need on even one of the lenses I will use it with to make any adjustments, so not too bad a thing.Conclusion:Get one if you want it for landscape, low speed portraits (esp families) or for product/architecture.

I never use the swivel screens on my other models but it would be nice knowing that I could if I had to.Do yourself a favor.

This review is for those SLR beginners like myself. I have never had the money to spend on a digital SLR but since now we have twin boys at home and D3200 finally came out I felt justified to spend the extra bucks. Specially after being disappointed by and returning the Canon S100.I have had the D3200 for 5 days now and even though I have not had the chance to take it outside that much, here are my impressions:1. Pictures are amazingly crisp and true to the color, simply beautiful2. FPS is fast and satisfying (although, with flash, not always fast enough for two 14 month old boys!). Now I find myself capturing motions that I could have never done before (compare to S100 of course)3. Takes Amazing videos with great sound4. Love the view finder, specially, since in this camera it's smarter and more detailed/informative than most LCDs5. The manual booklet is a good start for someone like me, but you will have to do additional research and playing around to understand all the available options in the Menu6. The Modes are quite useful once you understand them7. The LCD screen is so well pixilated that you can see the quality of your pictures right there and then8. The camera is the perfect size (specially if you're on the move and have your hands full already like me), light wight and grips well9. Battery is still on the original charge after about 200 pics and 10 videosFinally, I ordered the Wifi module last week but seems like Amazon is not going to get it anytime soon! I can't wait to try this functionality with my android. I will update the review once I get that but overall we love the Camera as is.===================================================Update 6/24/12 WMAU reviewAfter waiting for 2 months on Amazon I finally got the WU wireless module from somewhere else by paying an extra $25 and cancelling my order on Amazon.The module is pretty useful. Super small and comes with a cool case that attaches to your camera strap. Connects via WiFi to your phone (Android for now) and the associated wmau App (Wireless Mobile Adapter Utility) gives you the following 4 functionalities once you are connected Remotely:1. Use the Camera to take pictures that will be downloaded and to your phone instantly. Take about a sec per pic.2. Use the phone to take the pictures. can see the camera view live. Only provides the shutter options but it could come handy for taking family pictures on a tripod.2. Downloads the pictures (temporary memory) for viewing on your phone in seconds. I had about 200 pics that were downloaded in about three seconds. From there you view and select the files that you actually want to download to your phone. Every time you close the app the temp pics will go away. You can select a picture or multiple pictures to download permanently to your phone.4. You can \"share\" the downloaded photos. The share option gives you all the usual suspects, Facebook, Gmail, etc.I like the last two option as I am betting all my techie friends on Facebook are wondering how I posted a family picture via mobile with this quality! :) Little secret iphone10!Also, overall now that I have taken over 2000 pictures and 20 videos with D3200 all I can say to convey the quality of pictures, ease of use, speed, and other utilities made available in this camera are WOW and Love it!

Reading on the Nikon Rumors site, it appears that the D7000 may be replaced with a higher MP sensor (24.2 - same as the D3200) sometime this fall.Not wanting to wait, I thought I'd give the D3200 a try.  I still had to wait a bit, but finally got one from Amazon for $699 with Prime.This thing is NOT a toy!! It is a serious piece of camera gear, and if you spend time getting to understand all it can do, it will pay off handsomely with incredible pictures. I would also recommend getting a good Digital Image Management program to get the most out of your pictures (I'm using Adobe LightRoom 3).Doing some test shots with the D3200, those extra MegaPixels DO count, if you know what you are doing.  My brother-in-law (who just bought a Nikon D800 for $3,000 with no lens) was surprised at a shot I took at 6000x4000 JPG resolution, hand-held with available light at 1/20th of a second with the \"stock\" lens that comes with the camera.  You can blow the picture up to 36\" and still not see any blur!  You can get even HIGHER quality pictures by shooting in RAW format....Exposure bracketing is the only thing missing, IMO, but if they threw that in NOBODY would buy the D5100 or D7000 - it's that good.P.S.

Many things have changed since then, including the price and the competition in the market. END OF UPDATE.I had a chance to try this camera for two weeks with my Nikon lens collection. I compared it to my D5100 and a D7000.I skip repeating the features and specifications and just mention my final impression after using the camera in different conditions and with various lenses.1. It is getting too small. A DSLR should be comfortable to hold. D5100 was on the small size too and now this one is a bit smaller. i use a battery grip with my D5100 for maximum grip and comfort.2. Photos, out of camera, are not as smooth as those taken with D5100 and D7000. The extra megapixels didn't really add to the final picture quality, in my opinion.3. Exposure is unpredictable and often on the overexposure side. I tried it in various lighting conditions. I am well aware that they are fixable both in and out of camera, but is it too much to ask to have nice photos when I pay quite a few hundred dollars?4. Video quality is comparable to D5100. 60fps is a welcome change though.5. It is expensive for what it is. It is perhaps targeting the first-time DSLR buyers with the wrong price tag. You can do much better if you are willing to spend that much. (I am referring to the price as of August 2012. Its price may be adjusted in near future.) You are better off buying less expensive DSLR and save money to spend on better quality lenses. Keep reading below for recommendations.My recommendations (These are in case you have decided to buy a Nikon DSLR):1. If you can, wait for D5200 (it is not out yet as of August 2012),2. Get a D5100. It packs an impressive array of feature for the price,3. Get a less expensive one if an entry level camera is what you are looking for. D3100 should be on sale these days,4. I do not recommend D7000. It is a nice and able camera, of course. And I know that it has an impressive autofocus system. The difference just doesn't justify the hefty price tag for me. D5100 sports the very same sensor and produces identical picture quality for much less money.", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Well, I guess the pictures are enough not to say any other word", "Author": "N Jalali", "ReviewID": "R3GWDATN0UG3HD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very interested since it was announced and finally sold my D90 which I love forever and was my best nonliving friend since my son was born and bought this. although I was hesitant to sell D90 but I guess now the new little brother has a lot to say comparing to it.Pictures are really vivid, great colors and much more closer to real colors of the environment, focusing is not different from D90 although is accurate and fast enough, it is very handy and much more lighter than D90 and handling is quite easy. the settings are very easily adjusted and lacking the other dial is really not making any difference to me at all.I did not even use the 18-55mm lens and since I opened the box I added my Nikkor 35-f1.8 which is a huge addon to this camera.resolution is interestigly not double but triple or more of the D90 actually. I know it is only twice of that but really much more improvement you'll see when compare those two.colors, colors, colors, I love those.

I compare pictures taken with our Nikon D800, D300 and D40X, and our D3200 easily beats our D300 and D40X in terms of details, clarity and color depth, although still visibly not comparable to our D800 (which also benefits from its superior FX lenses). But with Photoshop on a 28-in HD monitor, besides the visibly more brilliant colors of the D800, I can only discern the D800's higher quality at 200% or higher magnification. At 100% (or Actual Pixels View) seeing the differences between our D3200 and D800 does require some careful examinations. It is no wonder DXO Marks ranks the D3200 among the best of Nikon professional and semi-professional DSLRs (Best of the Nikons: D800E (Best and also Industry Leader), D800, D600, D4, D3X, D3S, D3200, D3, D700, D7000; [...])2) Ease of Use: The D3200 is so easy to use; there are many shooting modes to choose from with its top Dial. I typically only stay with Manual, Aperture-priority, Shutter-priority and (if in a point-and-shoot situation) Programmed-auto modes. But as with other (amateur's) Nikon DSLRs, the D3200 offers point-and-shoot (Auto, Auto Flash Off) and preset modes (Portrait, landscape, Child, Sports, Close-up, Night Portrait). And then there is GUIDE mode (with on-screen guides) as well.3) Focus: There are many focus modes to give the maximum flexibility. However, I tend to stay with Spot (Single Area) Focus as I find with this much resolution, in high-magnification scrutiny, the Dynamic Area and the 3D Tracking Focus modes tend to give me a \"softer\" image.4) Working with Nikkor DX lenses: The D3200 pictures are pretty much comparable in resolution with the D800 in DX mode with most of our DX lens collection, the only differences (visible at 200% or higher magnifications) are with our Nikkor DX 35mm F2.8 and Tokina DX 11-16mm F2.8 (which requires manual focus), where I can see better details than the D800 in DX mode (with DX lenses).5) Working with Nikkor FX lenses (Manual Focus): Under very controlled situations and with a rigid tripod, the D3200 gives higher-detail results than the D800 in DX crop mode with our FX lenses.6) No Auto-Focus with FX lens: Without an internal motor, the D3200 cannot auto-focus when the (superior) FX lenses are mounted. This manual focus requirement is not an issue for me - I just use the D3200 electronic range finder to focus my FX lenses.7)Adjustments of Picture Quality: You can also choose how your picture quality can be controlled: Standard (default), Neutral, Vivid, Monochrome, Portrait, Landscape.8) Active D-lighting: Very nice results when I face situations of high contrast. This is almost High-Dynamic-Range (HDR). However I usually have this off since I do post processing of the raw images with Photoshop.OK, now some notes:9) No bracketing: This is not an issue for me (personally I think this is an over-exaggerated feature anyway, I rarely use this capability with my D800, D300)10) Light Metering: The D3200 Matrix metering has a tendency to overexpose a little in bright conditions; luckily it also offers exposure compensation up to a generous +/-5EV. I do advise that you take plenty of pictures in all metering modes as well as in Manual so you can tally up the effects and set the exposure compensation to get your best pictures results. Maybe Nikon will update the firmware to fix this.11) SD Card: Please make sure you use the fastest card you can afford. The D3200 files (especially if you shoot RAW (NEF) and JPEG Fine together) are large and the camera does take time to store and display images.12) HD Video Recording: The D3200 new 1080p25 and 1080p30 modes in addition to 1080p24 produce very nice videos - Live View is great - I find the continuous focusing during movie recording not only visually distracting but noisy and I just avoid it altogether and use single AF (AF-S) or manual focus for movies13) The tabbed menu system with long pages does take some getting used to (it does appear cumbersome at first).---Update---5) I've found no auto-focus issues with the majority of my FX lenses (AF-S and AF-I). However, besides the 1.5X factor, the minor issue is the D3200 does not quite cover the view 100% in its viewfinder; please keep this in mind when composing your picture with the FX lenses, as your actual picture will be not be as large as what you see in the viewfinder.10) After careful note-taking for a couple hundred photos, I've found that setting the D3200 to -1EV has yielded results pretty close to manually compensating the exposure via the viewfinder in most cases, including the case of the subject against strong bright background.", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Professional backup", "Author": "Edwin Karl \"professional/design\"", "ReviewID": "RG6ASCGQZEKKM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using Nikon cameras professionally for over 20 years.

Bravo Nikon!************************Just received this Camera today, and this is my preliminary Review (will update progresively).Background: I have upgraded my Nikon Digital D100->D200->D90->D5100->D3200.Okay, seemed I downgrade every single time, but actually not. (I also use D300, D3X, but those are different class of equipment). This path, is more for daily activity platform (lightweight).D90 -> D5100: I actually considered to buy D7000, but chose D5100 simply because the price, and the articulated LCD because I use it 50% for Video. I am glad I did! D5100 image quality is SUPERB and on par with D7000. D5100 is lot FASTER than D3000 & D3100, but a little bit slower than D7000. From D90 to D5100, it has lots of improvement in image quality, low noise in low light, much better video (with 20 minutes max per session). The only drawback I can see, is the battery coverage is not long enough (on Video mode), but it is understandable, and the solution is add another spare.D5100 -> D3200:Other than the obvious layout design difference, the only thing I eager to know is the Low Light Noise!So I am glad to report that IT IS COMPARABLE!See my attached photo (The Costco Connection image) and judge yourself (both image are taken with the same setting at ISO 6400)So, 3200 is a clear winner!*** Update ***I upload an image taken at ISO 12800 (Hi1). For me the image is very usable.Will update the review in a couple of days, once I get the whole importance difference between 5100 & 3200 ...*** Update After 200 shots ***1. My copy of 3200 has slightly over exposure consistently (but not much, probably 1/3 ev, but I actually like slightly under exposed)2. I noticed  a slight improvement of Dynamic range. I take a shoot at an overcast day, but surprise how it can capture the clouds, the trees and shadows3. An improvement in response. It is slightly faster than 5100, but not in the same level as D7000.4. Smoother Mirror, and quieter. It is noticable (but not sure if this is consistent between model, or just batch/production variance).*** Update in Video ***The Video is also amazing. It is comparable to D5100, especially the color rendetion is great!The low light performance is on par with D5100.The addition of 720p 60fps, and the Manual Audio Level control + Stereo Audio Meter is a real plus for Video Maker, making this DSLR a good choice for Serious Video taker. I wish it has a headphone Jack, but probably too much to ask for considering the price level. The focus tracking in Video mode is also improved, not substantially but good enough to be considered. I did 4 songs video clip and really satisfied with the result. Both the end result and the operational experience are great. I use the 720p 60fps mode for this project, and really like the result.I noticed slightly longer battery time, but not sure whether this is consistent or only slight production/batch variance. (*** Update: I finally found that It is a batch variance, because the other battery I have give me noticable longer running time ***).The additional Audio Meter view (press Info several time in the live view mode), is a really good addition for me, especially while attaching external Mic for Video mode (see my image). Also the option to set the Audio Level (Mic Input) is very useful. I took 10 Video clips already, and use the Mic Input to capture the Audio from A Mixer. The audio quality is SUPERB!For all the test, I didnt use the kit lens, but use Tamron 17-50 F2.8 VC.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Only as Good as Your Technique", "Author": "Charles Heckel", "ReviewID": "R3DBM95TLSXP5C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The sensor is all you'd expect it to be, and will deliver poster-size enlargements with no apparent pixelization; but when it comes to image quality, the sensor is only part of the pipeline.  The kit lens is all very well and plenty-good-enough for casual shooting, but making the most of 24 megapixels suggests the use of better optics, such as the fixed-focal-length Nikkor 60mm f/1.8, and flash or a tripod.  Older lenses won't autofocus with the D3200--you need the newer AF-S models--but you can focus manually with any lens using a built-in rangefinder function which is buried in the menu system.There are compromises with the D3200, just as there are with any entry-level camera.  The autofocus hunts a little in low light and with low-contrast scenes, burst mode isn't that fast, video playback flickers, and the memory chip needs a little time to swallow each RAW shot.  If you're not a pro, you don't need a camera that grabs each shot with the voracity of an Australian salt-water crocodile.  If you think you do, the D800 may be worth your kilobucks.You can take this camera out of the box, charge it up, fire away in auto mode, and get 16x20 enlargements of excellent image quality--just as photographers have been doing for years with 5-megapixel point-and-shoots.

However it does have some disadvantages. I'm going to list these first:1) Lenses, the big oneIt is crippled with older Nikon lenses. With most manual focus lenses, the meter won't function at all, not even as stop-down manual. You will get more function by mounting these lenses on a Canon using an adapter. Why Nikon cripple their cheaper cameras in this way is a mystery to me, but this is not for you if you own cherished Nikon lenses from the 35mm days.It is not capable of autofocusing with older Nikon autofocus lenses (AF lenses). Only the newest \"AF-S\" lenses will autofocus.The above are worse than they sound because even if you don't own Nikon lenses already, they still sell a lot of AF lenses and even a couple of manual focus lenses brand new, and don't have an AF-S equivalent. So you are restricting yourself to a smaller part of the Nikon lens range. However if you want manual focus, you can buy new manual focus lenses from suppliers like Zeiss or Rokinon that have the 'chip' which will allow the meter to work.I am switching from a Canon system so the above aren't a big issue for me, but it surprised me - although old Canon FD lenses don't even fit on any new Canon, any Canon lens you can buy now will work on any Canon digital SLR.[edited later - I am talking about full frame lenses - the EF-S lenses won't fit on a full frame camera]2) Build qualityThe camera is very small and light for a dSLR and built from plastic. I actually like this as I often carry the camera in a backpack, but if you want a camera you can throw around in the press pack, use in the rain or drop on the floor a lot, this isn't for you.3) ViewfinderThe viewfinder is less good than more expensive Nikons, it uses mirrors rather than a prism and lacks depth of field preview. This helps keep the weight down but means the image is less crisp and bright, and does not cover the whole frame.The above three are true of any of Nikon's cheaper, sub-thousand-dollar cameras.OK, now the good:1) Image quality...is superb. At ISO 100, it is better than almost anything from Canon, including some of their professional cameras, at low ISO, and only really beaten by the Nikon D800. Colors are rich and dynamic range is huge. Check out DXOmark and others if you don't believe me, but this is also my practical experience. If you crank up the ISO the more expensive cameras start to outperform it, but it is still perfectly usable.2) Very small and lightGreat if you carry it with you a lot while doing other things.3) Surprisingly fastAF is quick with the right lens, and will take 4 shots a second easily even with the huge megapixel files.4) Good ergonomicsFor a small camera, all the important controls are easy to find and use while the camera is at your eye.5) Good quality included lensThis is important because a lot of cameras are sold with a sub-standard lens but this is a good one. The sensor is so powerful, though, that it does reveal limitations of this lens and you will get better results from professional grade lenses- however these start at about twice what this camera costs together with the 18-55mm zoom.Altogether, it takes incredible pictures, so unless you have lens issues as noted above, highly recommended.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Preliminary impression: Love at first sight!", "Author": "J.

With several DX lenses, I'm committed to the small AP sensors, so I was elated to see Nikon come up with the D3200. So far, I'm very impressed. The camera body is so compact and lightweight, you have to hold one in your own hands to fully appreciate it.It will take some getting used to having fewer buttons and controlling most functions with the multi-selector, but after a couple of days, I'm getting the hang of it. The learning curve isn't too steep.I haven't tried shooting flash yet with my SB-800, but the built-in pop-up flash works very well.After I get through checking out the camera, I'll probably keep my 18-200mm DX zoom lens on most of the time, but for everyday casual shooting, the 18-55mm kit lens is giving very nice results, and its light weight goes perfectly with the D3200 camera body.This is no stripped-down entry level camera. It has most of the functions and capabilities of my far-more-expensive (and much heavier) D-300. A novice could use it as a point-and-shoot, but an advanced photographer could have complete control over their shots. And having 24 megapixels to work with while editing images is awesome.So the bottom line is that for me, the D3200 was love at first sight. Please note that I did a separate review of the Nikkor 18-55mm zoom lens that came with the camera body in the kit.I'll update my review as I get more experience with the camera.Note: If you have older Nikon DSLRs, your CF memory cards won't work in the D3200, nor will your batteries. The D3200 uses SDHC memory cards, and the battery is an EN-EL14, not the EN-EL3e that some of the earlier models used.UPDATE (June 3, 2012): I've used the D3200 for a week now, and I'm even more impressed with it than I was initially. There are a few functions of my old D300 that aren't available on the D3200, but they aren't functions that I used very much, if ever. To me, the benefits of a smaller, much lighter camera body more than outweigh the negatives. Also, I've used my Nikon SB-800 flash on the camera, and the camera and flash work very well together.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nikon D3200 hits it out of the park!", "Author": "Mr. Chute", "ReviewID": "RJ1IZW12DICLE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was sceptical about the need for 24mp and what an entry level camera could do.

But check out the Sony NEX 5n", "Author": "Doctor.Generosity", "ReviewID": "R2GVPRG1ZTIP4I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Recently I had a weekend opportunity (borrowing from friends) to get my hands simultaneously on this D3200, a new D800E, a Fujifim XPro-1 and a Sony NEX 5n, and I was able to compare them all, head to head on the same scene at the same ISO, both JPEG and RAW. Of course they all had different lenses, but I tried to minimize the variance by shooting at f8.As expected, the D800E was the best IQ, but the differences are subtle. At ordinary ISO, the D3200 was not as far behind as one might expect. Entry level DSLR's are a very competitive market segment and Nikon went all out in trying to pack in as much as they could for the price. The D3200 falls behind mostly at high ISO (3200). But of course the D800E costs more than five times as much as the D3200; is it really five times better? No, it is maybe 50% better for five times the price and twice the weight. Also the D3200 is much smaller and uses smaller, cheaper lenses. So the D3200 wins in terms of value for sure, especially if you plan to take most of your pictures in good light - those images were excellent, sparkling and clean.If you are interested in the other results, you can check out my XPro1 review linked below. The XPro1 images were remarkable; except for pixel count (16 MP vs. 36 MP for the D800E), the JPG's were almost as good as the full frame Nikon. Of course the XPro1 is also very expensive and idiosyncratic in other ways and it doesn't really compete with the D3200. It is a camera for rich dentists, not ordinary folk. The Sony NEX 5n on the other hand, is about the same price as the D3200 and is also impressive. At high ISO, the NEX gives nicer results than the D3200 but not quite as nice as the D800 or XPro1. If you want a camera which is much smaller than the D3200 but has comparable or slightly better image quality, check out the Sony. But there are many more lenses available for Nikon, and the SLR type viewfinder is still the easiest to use in my opinion (the NEX 5n LCD is better for street photography because less intimidating).Bottom line is that D3200 is excellent and a bargain, and most people will be very happy with it.http://www.amazon.com/review/RZFD6T3DK37ED/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm", "Date": "June 26, 2012"},

novice/Intermediate photographer and not for the advanced user.  I say that because the D3200 is certainly a camera that is worthy for an advanced or professional photographer. In fact, the D3200 is a marvel since it is possible for a novice to take professional looking photographs with only a few hours of study, but it will also allow a professional all of the capability that they would want for premium quality prints.Notes -Image Quality - Absolutely top-notch - the Nikon D3200 takes super crisp photos with excellent color representation. The additional functionality allows more advanced users to maximize light, shutter speed, and zoom/focal points.Why 24.2MP? - Why does someone want a camera with such high resolution? Well the answer is pretty straight-forward. A high resolution camera will allow you to zoom and crop any portion of your photograph without worrying about the image becoming grainy. This will allow you to zoom to a small area of interest and blow-it-up to a full scale print.Multiple ISO Sensitivity Settings - The various ISO settings allow for changing light sensitivity without loss of image quality. This is similar to the \"speed setting\" of film cameras and the 100,400, etc films of previous years.- Fit and Functionality - The Nikon D3200 feels great in you hands. While it is not *pocket sized* compared to the cheaper smaller cameras it is still light enough that you will not be fatigued after a day of shooting.- Outputs/Inputs - The Nikon D3200 has inputs for a mic and GPS and it has HDMI and a standard AV output.- VIdeo - The D3200 will take up to 20minutes of video at 1080P - the video quality is excellent.... I am not sure I would call it the equivalent of a full 1080P camcorder (Due to image stabilization and frame speed) it will certiainly work in a pinch.- Burst Mode - The camera will take 4photos/second in a burst. This will help you find the *right* shot even during an accidental blink. If you have never used a camera with burst mode you will be amazed at how much easier this makes in taking photos of children.Buffer - The Nikon D3200 has an internal buffer of (up to) 100 photos. This will allow you take a multitude of high resolution photos without having to wait for the camera to write to your memory card. On the topic of memory cards you will certainly only want to buy class 10 memory cards.Camera Modes - - Portrait - Used for Portraits with soft natural-looking skin tones. If the subject is far from the camera the background details will be softened. - Night Portrait - Use for a natural balance between the main subject and the background in portraits taken in low light. - Landscape - For vivid landscape shots when ample light is present. - Sports - Fast shutter speeds freeze motion in order to capture fast acting sports moments. - Close-up - For close up photos of flowers, photos, and small images taken at very close range. - Child Use for snapshots of children. Clothing and background details are vividly rendered while skin tones remain soft and natural.Final Verdict - Whether you a re a novice, intermediate, or advanced photographer you will likely be very pleased with the Nikon D3200. While you will need to spend a few hours with the manual all levels of photographers will be able to take stunning photographs.

Vogt", "ReviewID": "RH92D9V60VYXS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In terms of photographic usability... the Nikon D3200 is excellent. It's fast, comfortable to hold and shoot with, the menu system is intuitive, and LCD is much improved over the D3100. It feels solid and well-made and could stand up to the weight of a more pro-grade lens.The camera has solid image quality but perhaps slightly inferior noise performance when compared to its predecessor. If you are an everyday, casual shooter and not shooting much at ISO1600 and above (and not blowing your images up to huge sizes or doing heavy cropping) you will be perfectly happy with the picture quality from this camera. Especially if you're stepping up from a point and shoot. The camera displays good color reproduction, and the 18-55 kit lens is probably one of the best kit lenses to be offered by a cameramaker out there in terms of its optical performance. Dynamic range is excellent. It does overexpose some, so you might want apply some negative exposure compensation in bright conditions (other Nikon DSLRs have had this issue in the past as well).One disappointing feature that was on the D3100 but not of the D3200 is the drive mode switch on the top of the camera near the mode-dial. Also the switch between movie and video has been replaced with a button.The video is pretty good on this camera. I have not messed around too much with the video but from the footage I have taken so far, the video has been sharp and clean.Even though there is a slight drop in the imaging performance on this camera (again, unlikely to be noticed by casual shooters and even enthusiasts), I still reccommend it over the older D3100 due to the increase in performance and the higher LCD resolution. A very enjoyable camera to shoot with and will provide many years of great photos and dependable operation.", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finally got a new camera!", "Author": "Elaine C Thomas", "ReviewID": "R3B2OZHGAFNV7O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My Kodak got drowned in a surprise T-storm.

One, my favorite film camera is my Nikon and I have the AF lenses and flash that go with it and this model has a hotshoe for an external unit.  Two, I still like the viewfinder on my cameras!  Sometimes the sun or light glare prohibits using the screen.Even great for someone who isn't a professional.  I wouldn't recommend it for a beginner or a point and shooter because the controls can be a bit confusing to someone who has no knowledge of photography or the how and why for each of the settings.  I didn't give it a full 5 stars because sometimes it takes too long to start up when I power it on.

In fact, I'm just barely getting into it and I have to say, the money I spend on the Nikon D3200 is well worth it! The camera is very easy to use and has great manual features. Camera feels solid while holding it in the hands and doesn't feel cheap. Most of my family has Canon DSLR's and I was going to go with Canon, but took the risk and got this Nikon camera instead. It has not disappointed whatsoever. The images come out unbelievably crisp. It's not the megapixels that count, but rather how you shoot with the camera and the techniques. Of course, having 24MP's are great as pictures come out razor sharp.For those that just want to point and shoot out of the box, you can with the D3200 with the guide mode. Makes taking quick photographs easy and you learn to dive into the camera at the same time. The shutter seems fairly quiet when taking shots. Buttons are well placed and adequately labeled. Wish it had a touch screen for quicker selection and settings, but thats being nitpicky. Getting to the setting is quite easy and fast.Already bought some filters, a tripod and extra batteries. I'll be going to a wedding soon, so I'll try and get to know the camera better so I can take some great pics. Again, this is one of the best enrty-level cameras you can buy.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera with a couple of drawbacks", "Author": "Inspector Gadget \"Go Go Gadget Reviews\"", "ReviewID": "R1NC16RFC72EBL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera over a year ago to replace my Samsung HMX-R10 and it works brilliantly as a movie-making camera and as a still camera. Naturally, as there is a focus ring the D3200 is not focused to infinity so when you're lining up your shots, be it video or stills, you will need to take a bit of extra time. This wouldn't be such a hassle if there was a pop-out reversible screen (as featured on the Nikon D5100 model) but there isn't, which means if you are out shooting on your own and want yourself to be in the shot then you are going to run into many logistical problems. Quite annoying, but it's my only real gripe with this model. There IS auto-focus, naturally, but you can't be sure that you're actually in the shot and in position without a reversible screen.The quality of the pics, at 24.2 megapixels, is amazing, with very deep colors and bold contrast. When loaded onto your computer you can zoom-in many times without losing resolution. It's great. There are a few picture editing tools but I've never really experimented with them as I prefer my shots to look as natural as possible. The long-exposure feature is capable of creating night shots with amazing light effects.The video can record in 24fps, which is a major plus if you want your movies to look as film-ic as possible. Obviously setting it to 1080p is the best option. I wish that it shot in 2k but simple 1080p is all that it offers. Still, the quality of the video image is excellent, and a huge improvement on simple camcorders.There is an audio-in jack for attaching externals mics, and a shoe on the top for securing it (or an auxiliary flash), but when taking pics the built-in flash will not fire properly with a mic loaded.The strap is a bit of a gamble. Twice now the clasps have given way when I've been carrying it around my shoulder. Luckily, I was quick enough to catch the camera in my hand, but it's just too heavy. I'd recommend using vinyl tape or staples to bind the cord and ensure that it does not come undone.The 18-55mm lens is pretty basic, and you will have to stand very close to anything that you want to shoot, but it works perfectly with the 52mm Wide-Angle Lens if you want a mini-IMAX feel to your shots, and can also be used with the AG-LA7200 Anamorphic Lens to frame your movies in full 2.35:1 widescreen. The stills have a native aspect ratio of 1.55:1 and will come out in 2:1 with an anamorphic attachment that has a 1.33:1 squeeze.The camera uses SCHD memory cards that are loaded into a little slot on the right of casing, but the door that closes over this slot feels a little flimsy. It's never once broken on me, but it's one of those things that once broken can never be repaired which means that a new camera is on the cards if it does snap off.A very good camera, despite the drawbacks I have listed, I'd recommend this camera to newbs and novices as it is very easy to get familiar with. I love the red color and can stop polishing it whenever I get it out. I don't want any marks or fingerprints.

I figured having a camera and video camera in one would make it easier to take video of our kids, especially #3 who was sorely lacking in the video department compared to the first two. I was debating between the D5100 and the D3200. (The D5200 was just announced when I made the purchase and had forced the price of the D5100 down to about the same as the D3200). In the end, I decided the only thing I liked on the D5100 that wasn't on the D3200 was the swivel screen. And I figured the newer, higher megapixel sensor would make this one last longer before it was replaced with a newer model. Pretty soon the D5100 wasn't being sold by Amazon, so that sealed it since buying from Amazon would get me a free SD card, backpack, $100 off the 55-200 VR lens (also an upgrade from my non-VR 55-200) and 2% back plus downgrading from Prime shipping even netted me $3 to spend on Amazon Instant Video.Since getting it, I have loved it. I'd describe myself as an \"advanced\" novice photographer. The Guide option has been really helpful to get at some of the settings on the camera. Decided to go with the red body, and I kind of miss the texture of the black body, as the red is more smooth and \"plasticy\" feeling. But so far the red does make it stand out and easy to tell which one is mine among the crowd.The video by itself would probably get only 3 or 4 stars. It took some figuring to place the camera in AF-F mode to get the focusing right. For the first few I was pressing the shutter half way down to force the focusing. The sound of the focusing motor is noticeable most of the time. The shotgun hot shoe microphone might help with that according to some reviews of it. But having a single device that can do both has definitely made it possible to get more videos of the kids. Picture wise, the video has been fantastic.Definitely worth the price. Not sorry at all the I didn't go with the D5100.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "D3200 Great for Both Beginners and Moderate Photographers", "Author": "Chase", "ReviewID": "R36CJX2WN1W725", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to get some professional quality photos at a reasonable price for a beginner. I must say that the D3200 well exceeded all my expectations for spending about $550 on the body as well as the kit lens. However, I will update this review over the life of the camera, so you can get an accurate review to make an informed decision.Let's begin...So far, the camera on auto is great, but it's true beauty lies when the user tries to mess around with the manual settings. I've been able to achieve some fantastic photo effects by changing the features from the shutter speed to the ISO settings.Based on my pictures (and one video) thus far, I can definitely say the following:1. Auto Mode is okay. Honestly though, if all the you want to do with a camera is take pictures on auto., then purchase a cheaper digital camera since you won't be utilizing the D3200's full potential... or any DSLR for that matter.2. The 18-55mm kit lens takes great pictures, but its certainly not professional quality; Let alone designed for professionals. I fully intend to learn the camera and master it's settings before committing to a more expensive (professional quality) lens, which can amount to quite an expensive sum.3. The video visual was amazing, but the video audio was not. The camera does have a external mic input, which I intend to take full advantage of. TIP: Make sure to purchase a class 6 memory card or higher or the video may turn out \"laggish.\" I purchased a class 10.4. The 24.2 Megapixels was great if I wanted to crop without ruining the quality of the photo, otherwise it didn't make much (if any) difference when compared to 12ish megapixel photos.To sum up my experience, the D3200 is a great camera for beginners. I would even say the it's well suited for moderate level photographers if the camera isn't used on auto. mode. If anyone believes that they aren't getting great pictures, then I would say that the problem is most likely the photographer... not the camera itself. The camera truly does take fantastic pictures, yet it's less likely to happen on auto... and forget about professional quality with this 18-55mm lens. To truly take great pictures with this camera, you'll go far by going out one day to take a ton of pictures on various manual settings... then see for yourself what the effects are.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Much better than you expect of an \u201centry-level\u201d\u00a0camera.", "Author": "Bob Blaylock", "ReviewID": "R1I7ZLWAAUVLQ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a Nikon F2 Photomic, made in 1971.\u00a0 Forty years ago, this was Nikon's top-of-the-line camera.\u00a0 Between my F2 and this D3200, I have a variety of much-lesser film and digital cameras.\u00a0 I've long wished there was a digital back available for my F2, to convert it into a DSLR.\u00a0 The advantages of digital photography over stone-aged film photography are tremendous, but nothing else that I had before the D3200 could take pictures nearly as good as what I could get with my F2.\u00a0 This D3200 takes great pictures, easily in the same league as my old F2.\u00a0 This is actually Nikon's current bottom-of-the-line (they prefer the term \u201centry-level\u201d) DSLR, though quite a stock still seems to be out there, being sold in stores, of the now-obsolete predecessor to this camera, the D3100.\u00a0 The experience of using it sure doesn't feel like what you expect of bottom-of-the-line.\u00a0 It certainly does not feel like a step down in any way from my F2.\u00a0 This camera seems to do an amazing job of striking a balance between the needs of the rankest novice, and those of the most experienced, discerning professional or skilled amateur.\u00a0 It has fully-automated modes that implement an amazing degree of intelligence in determining the nature of the scene before it, and picking the optimal settings to photograph that scene,and it has fully-manual modes that allow the photographer to exercise complete control over every parameter.\u00a0 Although the manual claims that non-AI lenses (any F-mount lenses made before 1977) cannot be used with this camera, I have found that all of my old non-AI lenses that I have for my F2 work just fine on this camera, albeit with some obvious and expected limitations.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "New mom new camera", "Author": "P.

I have no prior experience or knowledge with things like aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  I'm slowly learning through research and playing with the camera.  I had read this camera was great for beginners, because the LCD screen is very visual as you are making changes.

I haven't really used the lens much as I purchased an additional lens when I purchased the camera.  I've read the lens is a good beginner lens.  As you learn more about how to use the camera, you'll eventually desire other lenses.  The camera comes with the rechargeable battery and charger, a camera strap that says NIKON and a lens cover.

Various feature improvements that I'm sure everyone knows about, and of course, a 24 megapixel sensor.  My biggest concern when deciding to buy this camera was noise - however, Nikon has done a great job on this sensor coupled with the new Expeed 3 processor.  Noise is LESS than with the D3100 and it \"only\" has 14 megapixels.  It is MUCH better with noise than the otherwise fantastic Sony A65, also with a 24mp sensor (and better than the A77 as well). Dynamic range is better than the D3100 as well.Yes, it still lacks some of the bells and whistles you expect to get with pricier camera bodies, and certainly noisier than full frame sensor cameras, but that's a whole different ball game. For the price nothing else can touch this great little camera at the moment, in my humble opinion.  If you're buying an entry level Nikon at this price point it might be a toss up between the D3200 and the D5100 now that the latter has dropped in price. The D5100 has more operational features, an articulating LCD panel and similar video, but the D3200 has 8 additional megapixels of resolution and somewhat better dynamic range with very similar noise profiles.

Even when using a prime lens (35mm/1.8 in my case) I can still see noticeable softness when viewing images at 100%. Even more so when using the 18-55mm kit lens. Still, there is more resolution in images under ideal conditions compared to the D5100, which I also own. Overall I prefer the D5100 images for sharpness, dynamic range, colors and low light noise.One other thing I noticed with my D3200 is that the VR on the kit lens can introduce blurring of images. Shooting at 55mm and 1/100 shutter speed (which Auto ISO and auto min shutter speed option will select and should be considered sufficient to eliminate camera shake) causes shaking which is visible in images. Only when switching VR off that blurriness is gone (this also means I can hold the camera steady enough). Also, I could observe the same with the 55-200mm lens at 55mm. So I don't think it is a lens issue. So I will keep VR on the kit lens off when shooting in good light. For the 55-200 however this is more complicated as at the 200mm tele end the VR switched on seems always better.Edit: upgraded the rating to 4/5 stars since there is a workaround to the issues I found. Also, I didn't want this review to be seen as negative.Update: The image softness at 100% pixel level is caused by the in camera jpeg processing. I just developed some of the RAW/NEF images taken with the 35/1.8 lens in good light and low ISO and they come out clear and sharp at the pixel level (with a little extra sharpening applied).

This camera is built in Thailand to the extent of my knowledge but the quality control on mine is absolutely incredible. Doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Has nice grips and a comfortable weight to it.

Basically it's sold as an entry level camera and can be use as a point and shoot camera and produces great pictures in this mode but it's also capable of operating in semi-manual and full manual mode so it will produce great pictures from the time you get it, through learning to get the most out out it in manual mode.The manual is very basic, as an entry level DSLR it should be much better, I am glad I bought an independent guide book.I was concerned about it being all plastic but the material seems solid and does not look cheap. The kit lens doesn't seem as sturdy as my old Pentax SLR lenses but it works well. Overall this camera represents great value for the money, it is compact and light. I would definately reccommend this to anyone consiering a first DSLR camera.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic for what it is", "Author": "J. Levin", "ReviewID": "R39CHVP1A1JZCD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For capturing pictures of \"life\" (things that are moving, people, pets, sports) a DSLR is really what you need. Buying a high end DSLR body is kind of a silly thing to do for most of us, because they become outclassed by newer technology so quickly. For example, this this is better at 90% of what it does than their highest end crop sensor models were only 3 years ago.So... if you need a DSLR for the shooting you do, this is a great option. 24mp is silly, but doesn't hurt high ISO performance too much. The AF performance is pretty good. You'll certainly do better with a 5000 or 7000 series model, but not that much better. The image quality in the right hands is pretty great, especially at low ISO.With the new firmware, the battery life has been fantastic for me. Last night, I shot 650 RAW images at a party, with the camera on (but LCD off) for nearly 6 hours straight, and with 500+ flash firings, and the battery status never dropped below the full three bars! I was pretty shocked. Tip: set the \"auto info\" setting to off, to avoid the LCD coming on every time you depress the shutter halfway.Also, this model is a wonderful size. It's about as small as it can be without compromising handling, and it's very lightweight. I don't mind carrying it nearly anywhere I want a non-pocketable camera. I use the 35mm 1.8g af-s prime lens on it nearly all the time. With a lens hood and protective filter (I like the Hoya heavy duty high definition protective filter), it's safe to use without a lens cap for long periods of time.One gripe: They limit the functionality of the camera in some silly ways. Maybe the worst offense is that they limit the use of the fn. button to four uses. On the higher end models, you get way more choices. For example, last night I wish I could have had an easy way to control the flash compensation, but it's a cumbersome process within menus. If this were an option for the fn. button, it would have made my night a lot easier.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "I like it, but was a greater fan of the D60", "Author": "Tiffany Hartman \"Tiff\"", "ReviewID": "R2JKM8BA4WG5ER", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There isn't much more I can say about this camera than what has already been said with regard to positive comments.  It is indeed a great camera and probably much more than the typical person needs.  I wouldn't recommend this camera to someone unless they are a hobbyist or budding professional because unless you are one of these, chances are you are going to throw it in auto mode and not give it the dignity it deserves by exploring its incredible capabilities.  In that case, I'd tell you to save your money and stick with a point-and-shoot because you'll probably get the same result since today's point-and-shoots are becoming quite advanced in their technology.  Based on what I understand about all of the specs, this camera is very similar to its upgrade which is the D5200.  It has a DX sensor as well.  It seems to me that unless you're a hard-core professional (and/or you really want the FX sensor), this camera has more than what you need and it's a great price (I paid $1,200 for the D60 kit back in 2008.  The D60 is an older version of this camera).The reason I did not give the D3200 5 stars is because I am comparing it to the older D60 that I have used for the last 5.5 years.  My husband and I updated from the D60 to the D3200 a couple of months ago.  The first thing I noticed is that all of the pictures were darker than what I was used to seeing with my D60.  I have gotten into the bad habit of using the LCD screen rather than the actual histograms to gauge exposure so at first, I thought that since the LCD on this camera is unusually bright, perhaps it was giving me inaccurately exposed previews of the photographs I took.  I turned down the screen's brightness a notch or two and learned more about histograms.  Still, the photos were dark once I viewed them on the same computer I have been using for years.  I checked the exposure compensation on the camera and it was at the factory setting of 0, so it wasn't like it was in an accidental negative setting without me being aware.  I switched into auto mode to test myself, thinking maybe I was doing something wrong.  Same problem even in auto.I typically shoot in aperture.  I am familiar with lighting.  I am saying that when shooting \"wide open\" outdoors on a sunny day, I am sometimes having to use a 200 and even on occasion, 400 ISO setting if my exposure compensation is set at 0.  If I use a 100 ISO setting, I have to turn up the exposure compensation to compensate.  With my D60, shooting outdoors on a sunny day (and sometimes even a cloudy day) with a medium f stop, a 100 ISO would occasionally be a bit too bright.  I am trying to understand if the D3200 is just mechanically different and I need to get used to majorly boosting my ISO or if there happens to be something wrong with my particular camera and if so, I'd like to know so that I can return it to Costco within my 90 day window.  If anyone can help me out with this, I'd appreciate it.  I have searched exhaustively online and have seen very little about chronic underexposure with the D3200.I am aware that the sensor on the D3200 is slightly smaller than that of the D60 and have considered that this may be the issue.  If it is, I am very disappointed because there is a significant difference between the two as far as lighting is concerned and in this case, I would say that Nikon has regressed rather than improved its entry-level camera.  I read that although the sensor is a bit smaller, it is newer so should still perform just as well if not better than the D60's sensor, but I'm not so sure that this is true.  I have to work considerably harder with the D3200 to get the same image that I could quickly take with the D60 without a second thought.  I am afraid to say that this has knocked the \"fun\" wind out of me and the camera has been sitting around without use for longer than is normal for me.Also, if you are purchasing this camera in order to utilize the wifi feature, I would discourage you from doing so.  This was the main reason we updated and the wifi adapter simply does not work.  We tried it with both an iPhone and an Android  for several hours at a time.  The adapter shuts down your ability to change settings with the camera while in use.  The moment we opened the app, the camera would take a picture (it is not supposed to do this until the remote shutter release button is tapped on your phone).  It would then begin uploading our unintentional photo and in the process, the wifi would disconnect.  This process eventually drained our battery in the middle of our Christmas card photo shoot.  We had to charge it for an hour and put it back in the camera before it was fully finished because we were losing daylight.  We tried again and had the same result so we resorted to using the old-fashioned timer method.  We were never able to take even one intentional photograph using the wifi adapter.  I love Nikon and am loyal to the brand, but the wifi gimmick is a crime.Anyway, if anyone can help me with the underexposure issue, I'd be very grateful.  I have been able to find little help with this online.  Most people tell me it is operator error but I have checked myself a thousand times and I have been a hobbyist for 5.5 years.  After months of using this camera, if I was doing something wrong, I am pretty sure I would have caught it by now.  I even read the user manual cover to cover and am still in the same boat.  Being familiar with Nikon for nearly 6 years, and at this point in my investigation, I'd say it is highly unlikely that it is me.  In your experience, does the D3200 underexpose compared to the D60?  If you can tell me if you have noticed the same thing or not, I'd really appreciate it!", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Edward L.

The Nikon D3200 is all you need as it produces beautiful pictures with beautiful color and sharpness. I'm just an average guy who likes to take both pictures and videos. I am not a professional photographer. All most people will need is the kit lens that comes with this camera and to shoot at the smallest picture size and the lowest quality JPEGs. The photos come out great despite the small size so they quickly can be uploaded to Flickr, Facebook or Picasa, etc. They print well too. No need for 24 megapixels. What makes this camera stand out is the fill flash; that is, when using the flash, this model automatically knows how much flash you need and your pictures come out great. This feature alone makes this camera worth it's money.I've learned to come out the auto mode and use the program mode which lets the camera do most the things for you.As for video, well, this type of camera is not the best for that. The quality is good but it can't focus fast enough and the lens makes a lot of noise when doing so. You can press half way down on the shutter and it will refocus and it will automatically adjust for light but this type of camera cannot zoom automatically so it cannot film like a camcorder. The sound is uncompressed which is great, but only in mono. It cannot film at 60 frames at 1920x1080; only at 1280x720. You should always film at 60 frames as it comes out much smoother and later can be edited using software and reduced to 30 frames if you wish.I've used ultra zoom cameras for years and currently have a Sony HX100V digital camera. It makes great videos but I was disappointed in the photo qualily which produced an \"oil painting\" like quality when looked at closely.So, yes, I would highly recommend this camera for photography but I am going to hang on to my Sony ultra zoom for video use.

But, I ended up with the D3200 and I love it! The D3200 is one of the best cameras that I have ever used. It is lightweight, durable, and takes beautiful pictures. The options on the camera are great and very user friendly. This is definitely a step up from the D3100 because it has the ability to take more  photos per second (action) and the higher mega pixel count gives it phenomenal color. The resolution of the screen on the D3200 is so much better as well. The higher megapixel count also allows the photographer some room to crop the photo down if necessary. To boil it down:Pros:-More frames per second capability than the D3100-More Megapixels (and bang for your buck)-High resolution screen-Lightweight and durable-Fast processor (no more waiting for your pictures to process with your old point and shoot)Cons:-Doesn't have a focus motor built into the camera -- meaning to get auto focus you must purchase a lens that has a motor in it. Nikkor lenses with AF-S or AF-I in their names.-With larger telephoto lenses it can be a little bit off center when you hold it, but that is to be expected because telephoto lenses are heavy by nature.-Not a full frame sensor but a great value for the price.I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who is will to pay a little extra and get the quality. If you have a bigger budget however, definitely choose a camera that has an autofocus motor in it and a full frame sensor with no crop factor.

Switzer", "ReviewID": "R3IYC2HMUP46DK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Review of the Nikon D3200So far, I am impressed with this camera.I just got it a few days ago, and I am already putting it through its paces, consulting the manual, which it has both a short user guide in hard copy and a PDF format full manual on CD.  The short manual and the full manual cover most of the same things, but the longer version has more detailed information about some features that are only briefly touched on in the shorter manual.  (The short hard copy manual has 77 pages, whereas the full manual on CD rom has 228 pages.)  The PDF manual also has copies of the manual in various languages Chinese, English, Spanish, French, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese.  In my package there was also a short hard copy manual in Spanish.  There is also a Guide Mode in the camera itself which has pointers and tips as to how to use the camera.I have already taken a few pictures and a short movie with it and I am very impressed with it so far.  This is a very nearly professional camera for a mid level camera.  And I am sure a professional could use it without any problems.  With a good lens, a pro should be able to shoot excellent images with it.Until I got this camera, I was quite happy with my 5 megapixel Sony F717 camera.  It was indeed a great camera and I took plenty of pictures with it.  And it had quite an array of features of its own, and it was quite near the quality of a professional SLR camera.  But then it started developing memory errors and finally the camera simply died on me after 10 years of faithful service.  I could not power it up, even though I bought another power adapter for it.  So I decided it was time to get a new camera.  I always liked the Nikon cameras.  And I have an old Nikkormat manual SLR 35mm camera, which I took thousands of great pictures with.  So I decided to gamble with Nikon again and upgrade my digital camera.  I wanted a good high res camera so I opted to get a 24 megapixel camera.The camera is little different from a standard film SLR camera.  You can do practically anything with this camera that you can with a manual or automatic film SLR -- and some things that you can't with a regular film SLR.  And you can get some really great images with this camera.  The camera is capable of creating images of resolutions up to 6016 x 4000 pixels and as small as 3008 x 2000.  (My old Sony digital camera by contrast took pictures of 2560  x 1920 maximum size.)  That translates to a size of 20.1 x 13.3 inches or 50.9 x 33.8 cm at 300 dpi.  Of course you can enlarge the image even further using a computer with image editing software such as Paintshop Pro, or Adobe Photoshop, and there would be no pixelation, and obviously you can also edit the image in other ways and add special effects, etc.It has a standard viewfinder that all SLR cameras have where you can see the image as the lens sees it, but if you like to use the digital monitor, all you have to do is press a button and then you can see the image in the digital monitor.  But if you use the monitor, it is a good idea to use it in low light such as indoors.  Those types of monitors are hard to see in sunlight.  Movies however can only be shot using the monitor.One great feature that I love with this camera is that it can do both movies and still pictures with the same camera.  It takes high quality video at 1920 x 1080 maximum and 640 x 424 minimum.  You can take stills while shooting a movie too.  And it can shoot up 64 frames per second.  And you can adjust settings such as f-stop, ISO, and other settings to get the best movie images.  To shoot video in stereo sound, you need a special stereo microphone.  It has a standard micro audio in jack, so you can hook any microphone to it including stereo microphones.The camera has a built in flash, but also supports hot shoe for external flashes.  There is no jack for using flash with cable however, unless you have a flash cable that uses the hot shoe, or some kind of remote control flash.Because I had old lenses that I used and were compatible with my old manual 35mm camera, I wondered if they would work with my digital camera.  And, yes, they do work.  I have a wide angle Nikkor lens, and a 200mm Rokunar zoom lens, and both work with the camera, that way, I don't have to buy new zoom lenses or wide angle lenses.  Of course, because these are manual lenses, you have to do everything manually such as focus, and f-stop, but they work.  So if you have a good high quality lens from a manual 35mm Nikon or compatible camera, you likely could use it.  And as one commenter in this forum put it, and as any professional photographer will tell you, the lens or the \"glass\" in the front of the camera is one of the key ingredients to getting great crisp sharp pictures with a camera.  The digital image processor, which is the digital equivalent of film is the next ingredient.  And as far as I can tell, this seems to be a high quality image processor.Like any professional SLR camera, you can vary shutter speed manually, anything from long time exposures (such as for night city lights or stars), to 1/4000 of a second (for high action photography).  It also has ISO ( or ASA) settings which adjusts the sensitivity of the internal image processor to simulate film light sensitivity.  Normal standard film is 100 ASA or ISO, but if you are in a low light setting and need to simulate a higher speed film, so that you can shoot in low light levels at higher shutter speeds and small f-stops, you can set your ISO setting to 400 to simulate 400 speed film or set to 1000 ISO (ASA) to shoot indoors in low light without using flash and you can use higher f-stops and/or faster shutter speeds and still capture good images.  It goes up to a whopping 12800 ISO, great for night shooting in very low light.  But, like real film, the higher the ISO or ASA rating, you may get grainy images or \"noise\" in your images, and color gets washed out in low light levels.  Of course, I mentioned f-stops and these are adjustable too.  If you are using a manual lens, you will have to adjust manually, and f-stops vary according to the individual lens.  Some lenses have f-stops from 1.0 and go up to f 22 and even to f 64  (F-stop, by the way, for novice photographers, is also called aperture opening, this sets the opening in the iris, or the eye of the camera.  It is very much like the pupil of the eye. The higher the number, the smaller the opening.  Hence, with a low f-stop, you have a wide opening to let in more light, but also less depth of field, that is, the range of distances where objects will be sharp.  The higher the f-stop the less light, but greater depth of field.  Thus getting a properly exposed image means finding the right combination(s) of film speed, shutter speed and f-stop. )Of course, if you are just looking for a quality but simple point and shoot camera, this camera has a fully auto mode, which will handle everything for you, f-stop, focus, and shutter speed.  All you do is point, look through the viewfinder or use the monitor to frame the image you want, push the shutter release button just lightly to allow the camera to focus and adjust settings, and then it will beep, push down, and click, it will take the picture.  (But then, of course, you will have to use only the fully automatic lenses with the camera.  You can buy additional lenses separately.)  The camera will warn you if your image will be underexposed, and in auto mode, the built in flash may pop up.  There is a built in light meter, but it only works with the automatic lenses, but if you are shooting manually with a CPU lens, that is a lens that can be used fully automatically with that camera, the light meter will be of great help in getting good exposures.  After you take the picture, the monitor will show you what your image looks like and there is a menu where you can browse your pictures and even do some editing and even delete bad images.  No more waiting days for your film to come back from processing, and then you see if you made a mistake!  If you don't like the image you took, you can change the settings and shoot another image until you get it right.The camera has everything a novice photographer would need to get started.  There are also special automatic settings that the camera has to shoot specific subjects easily, such as a setting for portraits, settings for shooting children, settings for action and sports, automatic settings for low light situations, etc.So this camera covers a range from professional photographers to rank amateur and novice photographers.Other features include, burst shooting, where you can shoot a rapid sequence of images up to 4 images per second such a for capturing dynamic action.  It has a timer for self portraits or situations where you may want to wait a few seconds before shooting the image.  There is a white adjust so that light looks natural in different kinds of light, such as florescent light, sunlight etc.  Some automatic lenses also include features, such as image stabilization to avoid the shakes in video and motion blurs in stills.The camera body seems to be a fairly solid construction and fairly rugged.  It is a solid molded plastic with rubber grips.  Of course, you wouldn't want to drop the camera because of all the electronics, but the body seems to be a fairly solid molded exterior.  It has a good ergonomic feel and is a less clunky and is somewhat more lightweight than my F717 camera which had the trademark long lens.The camera takes a variety of SD format sticks.  If you don't have a compatible card reader on your computer, you can use the USB connection to upload your pictures to your computer.  Depending on the size of your stick, image size, the level of compression you use, and whether you are shooting movies or stills you can store anywhere from hundreds to thousands of pictures or several movies of 20 min length on your memory stick.  I bought a 32GB stick which can store thousands of pictures without having to change sticks.  It sure saves on buying film!  After you upload, you can then delete the images and movies off of your stick, if you desire, to make more room, especially if you shoot a lot of pictures.The camera in the box comes with the camera body, the lens that is advertised to come with the camera depending on the camera you buy (and that is a fully automatic lens.)  A shorter booklet manual, CDs for the PDF version of the manual, which is the longer manual, the charger, a L -ion battery, a neck strap, and basic software for handling, importing, and editing your images, movies, etc., and a couple of small odds and ends, such as lens caps, viewfinder cover (if you are shooting without looking into the viewfinder, to prevent light leaks).  If you have Windows 7, Vista, or XP, you can actually access the images and movies and move them without any special software, but the software simply makes it easier.  If you have a compatible memory card reader or USB connection, you can simply use windows utilities to read the files on the stick.  They are just ordinary *.jpg and *.mov files.  There are no proprietary formats or any special data types for which you have to use the provided software.  If you shoot in uncompressed format, the stick will then store .nef files.By the way, if you want to do things like double or multiple exposures and special effects, that is all doable with image editing software such as Paintshop Pro or the more popular and well known Adobe Photoshop.  Hey, this is digital photography!  You don't need to do them with your camera.  But the camera does have some effects you can add during or after you take the picture.  And the software included with the camera can do some basic image editing, but it is not a full fledged image editing software package.This is my review so far.

When the price dropped and Coke spilled into our Point and Shoot the time was right.Have been playing with it for about 10 days, the menus were pretty easy to figure out once I learned about basic camera settings.  The Auto setting produced some of the best pictures I have taken, though considering what I was using before that may not be saying much.  Did not play with the guide mode, thought I would but we dove directly into the Manual mode which forced us to learn the settings.  The adjustments took reading the manual to figure out, but once we learned them they were easy to adjust on the fly (ISO, Shutter Speed and F-Stop).  As we worked through the settings, we were able to improve our skills and see the D3200 really shine.  Seems to take excellent low level light shots, and high speed action seemed to be no problem.  The detail was great on all the shots.The setup menus were easy to figure out, thought they were quite intuitive.  Also the build quality is great, it was smaller than expected, but fits in the hands well, and has a solid feel.  The rear display looks great and is a good preview.  Data through the viewfinder was also easy to read and great as we learned how to adjust settings without using the info page.Overall I would recommend it.  Through all the research I found that the more knowledgeable people were who reviewed it, the more they found that they complained about.  Now that I have it in hand, I realized that while what they are saying may be true, this is an entry level DSLR, and to the target audience, it does not matter.

The 24MP is overkill for most, true enough but for some of the enlargements I plan to do it works for me.  I personally think the D3200 is a bit beyond an \"entry level\" classification so instead I'll call it a \"Pro-Wannabe\".  Or perhaps a \"Second-string Pro\".  Focus is pretty fast, shoots pretty fast and pics come out great.  The detail on enlargements is remarkable.  Quality photos can be had on auto right out of the box.  The menu is great too both of which will get newbies into the action rather immediately.  I shoot largely in the program mode and dabble in the other priority modes.  Switching settings is pretty quick with the info button and the programmable function button helps that much more.  I presently have it set for quick ISO changes.  Indoor shooting without a flash is quite good and I haven't really hit any readily visible noise until ISO 6400.  I'm still shooting with the kit lens but can't wait to put a 50mm/1.8 on it!

The Nikon D3200 is making it very easy for me to learn, however.

I would invest in getting a battery grip for the camera it makes  balance and so much easier to hold get the Vello BG-N9 battery grip along with the Vello - Shutter Release Cable for BG-N9 it ties grip into the camera and adds another battery so u can shoot longer to. i have not regret gettting it  you will love it to just get those things i listed and u  will love it to  as for flash will it thats up to you  ? what u will  use it for  SB-910 and the SB-700 will do a great job ***************** update as of febuary 2013 i upgraded to a nikon D7000  there was nothing wroung with the D3200 just wonted more options to choose from the D3200 was a great camera to start off with i enjoy my time i spent with it i hope every other user enjoy it as much as i did", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera, going to be a great entry DSLR", "Author": "Jeeper \"Jeeper\"", "ReviewID": "R3CPUT5VZIYC7C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently bought the D3200 and have run a couple hundred images through it.  Long exposure night shots have been great, both with the kit 18-55mm lens and the Tamron 70-300mm lens.  I wish it did have some effect modes like the point and shoot cameras have as well as other brand DSLR's (IE sepia mode, etc..) That can also be done in post processing though.  The software that comes with the camera also seems to work great for some minor post processing work, especially just shifting white balance and things.  I picked up a wireless remote and corded shutter release at the same time as well as polarizing and UV filters.  Focusing could be a little faster, but at this price point I am not complaining.The camera itself is very light, so a large lens throws it a little off balance.My biggest complaint is the optional wireless adapter.  I bought it because it said you could use it as a shutter release.  You cannot use it as a shutter release if live mode is active, and you can only use it to trigger the shutter, you cannot use it to do a long exposure in bulb mode.The app is also a little flaky, if you let your tablet/phone go to sleep while you are transferring photos from the camera it cancels the transfer.

For many years I used various 35mm cameras and one medium format one that take film.  I took thousands of slides and pictures.  When digital started with Sony floppy disk cameras I bought one.  I used the digital cameras with my work in heavy machines.  I graduated to more Sony digitals.  I always had high end phones, and those started having better and better digital cameras.  I never got rid of my favorite film cameras.  These include a 1953 Voightlander Prominent, Olympus OM2n, Olympus XA, Olympus Stylus.  I learned to edit pictures early on using Photoshop.  I have used Picasa since introduced.  I really like Picasa as it is OK for the thousands of pictures of machines I need to quickly edit and add to web sites.  Recently I have started using iPhoto.  iPhoto IMHO is much more capable than Picasa.I stopped using film a few years back and have started back using film in the last two years.  I started to try and get better pictures with my digital compact and phone cameras.  Those work well with scenery pictures at a mid level of quality, but were hopeless taking pictures of pets or children or any action.  When I saw the Olympus OMD in chrome I immediately wanted one of those.  Looked my my 1980 Olympus OM2n which I have always thought was just about a perfect camera and beautiful.  Mine works perfectly after 33 years BTW.  So I did months of research on the OMD and then tried to see and hold one in person.  There is only one Olympus dealer in San Diego and they kept selling out of them.  Once I got to see a black OMD but no chrome.  Then Oly started the on again off again sales.  I was pressured by going on a long trip last summer so I wanted to get a new DSLR.  This was complicated by the fact that Olympus is a smaller sensor format that not everyone likes.  No actual live viewfinder.  And it costs a lot more than Nikon 3200.The other camera I considered extensively was the Sony Nex 6.  In the past I had only bought Sony digitals and consider them a superior product.  The Nex 6 was less money than the Olympus OMD.  What turned me towards the Nikon was recommendations.  On line recommenders like Nikons.  The Sony early last summer had a limited selection of lenses like the ones I wanted.  Olympus had want I wanted, but I never could hold one in my hands and it was twice the price of the Nikon 3200.  I drove several times to the local camera store to see the Olympus, but no luck.So I ordered the Nikon and two additional lens from Amazon.  As usual Amazon delivered everything fast and in perfect condition.  The Nikon has worked flawlessly from day 1.  The 3200 is fairly easy to learn.  The adjustments and controls take a little time to get used to but are relatively easy.  It takes very good digital pictures without much effort.  Those who just want to take pictures that are pretty good should just take the standard 18-55mm lens with image stabilization and leave it at that.  It works fine for pictures blown up on my 27\" computer monitor.  The only annoying thing is that with a lens as slow as this one the built in flash is always popping up.  Even in shots that don't need a flash.  So I find myself setting the camera flash off frequently.  I have not used the two additional lenses I bought much.  The longer lens a few times for distant scenery.  I thought I would use the much faster 35mm lens all the time.  So far that is not the case.  Before I bought it I did not notice that the 35mm lens did not have image stabilization.  When I have used it that has not been an issue.  I come from many cameras that did not have IS and always instinctively hold my breath and stay still when shooting.The Nikon is much larger than my Olympus OM2.  I would prefer the OM2 size.  But I find the 3200 very comfortable in my hands.  Yes it is big, but the size and weight works well.  It is a plastic camera.  It is well made but very plastic.  Much more so than my last Sony compact camera.  The Sony has a much more pleasing quality look to it.  The comparison between the Voightlander or OM2 in quality appearance and feel is vast.  In the distant past I owned a Nikon FM SLR and can attest that Nikon knows how to make a very high quality look and feel camera.  The Nikon is not cheap plastic feeling, but rubberized sorta cheap plastic feeling.  If you really like Apple products like Mac Books, iPhones, iPads you may not like this product.  It is in no way a jewell like thing of beauty like Apple products.But it takes very good pictures easily.  It focuses fairly quickly and comes up with very good color balanced shots on automatic.  It has a small view finder.  Much much much smaller and less useful than my 33 year old Olympus.  For me the viewfinder size and lack of light is the worst feature.I have most of my film cameras on display in a glass cabinet in my office.  The Voightlander is a thing of beauty.  It still works well after 60 years.  The last time it was cleaned and worked on was 1979.  It is hard to use.  Mostly because of it's small and dull view finder.  Maybe some day I will buy a Leica M3 for the finder.  The metal working and gorgeous glass lenses on the Voightlander put a smile on my face just holding it in my eye or hand.  The Olympus OM2n is only slightly less so.  The metal on the Oly is not as nice but the Olympus easy operation makes up for it.  Both the Voightlander and the Olympus are about the same size.  The Nikon 3200 as a tool to take pictures is a good camera.  The shots I have taken with it at the highest settings on the sharpest (35mm) lens are very good.  They are not as good as shots taken with my OM2 and it's 50mm lens with good film in color or detail.  However, the Nikon is much easier to use and get good shots with.  But I feel absolutely no passion for the 3200 and good photography demands passion.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera!

I am new to DSLR but have used Nikon D40 before. So this review is for novice. D3200 is a light weight, small camera that packs many features. I use it for my kids primarily. The picture quality is very crisp and clear. The 24mp thing doesn't make much difference to naked eyes, but sure is nice when you need to blow up the pictures to print. We had some portraits done by a photo studio and some pictures look blurry at 12x12. Even with my cheap inkjet printer at home, there's a difference when I print pictures from various sources.I noticed after a few days that I don't like the color saturation of the pictures. The colors don't \"pop\". Found out online that D3200 does not saturate the colors as much as other DSLRs in its standard mode. If you like more vivid colors, you have to adjust the image quality under Shooting Menu in one of the manual modes. I cranked up the contrast and saturation in Vivid mode and the colors came out a lot better. Some reviews complain about its tendency to overexpose, I wonder if that's what they're talking about. Kids don't look very good if they look pale.I also noticed that it performs more like a point-n-shoot camera under indoor low light while using one of the preprogramed settings. The light compensating bulb in the front is very, very bright. As I'm getting more comfortable with the various settings, I find myself moving toward the P, A, S modes. I haven't had time to use it on landscape. I look forward to using it during our trips this fall. I haven't used the video function either. Looks a bit too complicated for me.

It offers a variety of options for the serious as well as point-n-shoot amateurs.Menu settings are easy to follow though the accompanying guide was not very  elaborate. You need to download more detailed reference manual from the Nikon USA site for more detailed help.The camera has manual(M), aperture priority(A), shutter priority(S), program(P), auto with and without flash and various scene modes. All the non-auto modes work great and offer you a lot of flexibility. I did not use the auto or preset scenes modes I found most of what I needed in the other modes.The auto-focus has a variety of options to suit various situations & scenarios (all the way from single point focus to wider area for focus. However I found the exposure metering options to be somewhat limited. The AF-L/AE-L button allows you to lock auto-focus and auto-exposure as you pan the camera. and it is useful when you want to focus on the subject on the side of the frame.The wireless adapter is a useful addition to the camera as it lets you take pictures on the camera remotely or download or view pictures from an Android phone.

The 24.2MP sensor is astounding and you can get some really beautiful images off this even with the included kit lens. For the price I don't think you could do all that much better. The video recording is also pretty nice, and the built in microphone is great for what it is.Obviously it lacks some features that some more expensive cameras have, such a built in AF motor which limits you to lenses that contain a motor unless you you just want to do manual focus.Overall I would recommend this anyone that enjoys taking pictures and wants to get something great at an affordable price, if you're buying this and expecting a professional grade DSLR then look elsewhere.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful, Portable and worth the price", "Author": "diya alhihi", "ReviewID": "R3ROJPDH6UWYIC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Such a great camera, sexy and small.

The D3200 fits the bill nicely.  The D3200 is a \"starter\" DSLR that is loaded with features. For the nearly newbie, the guide mode will help take some of the mystery out of a camera with more buttons, dials and settings than the typical point and shoot.The D3200 has several automatic settings for the typical shooting situations that will set the likely settings needed for the shot.  This will allow those of you who want a nice camera's quality without spending too much time learning speed, aperture, f-stops and the like.  Switch selectable modes include night portrait, portrait, landscapes, kids, sports and macro. The experienced photographer can configure the camera with full manual settings, shutter priority, aperture priority and the like.I find the D3200 fits nicely in my hand and makes it easy to position for the shot.  I like having the eyepiece for the viewfinder as I'm often shooting outside. LCD displays are often overpowered by the ambient light which for me is the reason to consider this camera over some of the similarly priced compact cameras.

In the past, I've shot with Sony, Canon, Fujifilm, Mamiya Sekor, and some others that I can't remember.  I have no brand loyalty; I will use any camera that is able to generate good images on a consistent basis.  Most of my shooting is outdoors, daytime (dawn to dusk) using burst shooting and telephoto at or near 300mm (450mm ff equivalent), but of course there are exceptions.  I do a lot of shooting in very high-contrast situations (brilliant white sunlit foam against a dark blue sea or shaded cliffs, for example).  I do a lot of cropping and/or enlarging for prints up to 20x16in or larger.My comments on the D3200 are based on expectations and comparisons with results obtained with other cameras, mainly the K-5 (using kit lenses) and the FZ150.  I also did the same shots fairly recently with the Pentax K-r (which I sold to upgrade to the K-5) and a Fuji S100FS (superzoom bridge camera with 2/3in sensor, 11MP and 14.3 optical zoom, which was great but not quick enough in burst mode), and those results also enter into my evaluation.My purpose in buying the D3200 was:1. Get higher resolution than I have with the K-5 or FZ150.2. Have something that would be a bit lighter than the K-5, while matching it in IQ.3. Have decent burst speed and depth.  (With the K-5 I shoot a lot at 7fps; with the FZ150 I alternate between 5.5 and 12fps.  All at full resolution, RAW.)Beyond this, I was going to be pretty easy to please.  I don't do much low-light shooting, and I don't mind doing PP.The good:--The D3200 is a nice camera in terms of design, pretty well laid out.--The D3200 feels good in the hand, is well balanced, and light yet solid.--The kit 55-300 lens functions well and smoothly, and is solid, with a metal bayonet mount that works easily and firmly.--The LCD is a real delight.  Very bright, good resolution and contrast, very easy to read.  (And I am a committed VF user. ;0)--Battery and memory card doors are light but don't feel flimsy; they are well designed for quick opening and closing.--The burst at 4fps (RAW or JPEG) is acceptable for many action shots, and steady.--The VR (anti-shake) works very well and hand-held full-zoom (300mm) shots are clear at 1/180.  (I didn't go below this shutter speed yet.)--AF is quick and reliable.  (In a complex physical environment, it's most effective if you select single point focus as otherwise the camera may focus on something other than your intended subject, but this isn't unusual.)--Color and WB are very good right out of the box.The not so good:--Unfortunately, at present there is no substitute battery available, so you must pay between $40 and $50 for a Nikon battery.  Both Pentax and Panasonic also charge a lot for their batteries, but other totally acceptable options (which I have as backup) are available for a fraction of the price.--Another drawback is the NEF Raw format used in the D3200.  Unless you have CS5 (or maybe CS6) or equivalent, you can't process D3200 NEF images in Photoshop.  (You can process earlier versions of NEF, but NEF keeps evolving.)  Luckily, there are free programs like Raw Therapee, Irfanview and FastStone which do read NEF from this camera.  Of course, there is also NX2 (Nikon PP software) which you can download off the internet or from the CD with the camera.  It's a good program for  improving image IQ, but lacks layers and other features found in PhotoShop.  You also can convert to Adobe DNG (which is read by PhotoShop and other programs); the free DNG Converter may be downloaded off the net.  Be sure to get Version 7.1; earlier versions will not work with D3200 NEF (I found this out the hard way).--There are a couple of shortcomings in the controls, but most of the main functions are quickly accessed and changed by pushing the \"I\" button on the lower left of the back of the camera (below the lower left corner of the LCD).--The camera has an irritating eagerness to make you use the LCD to view your settings.  It would be nice to have full information easily accessible through the viewfinder, instead of having to take the camera away from your eye.  Example: to switch to and from burst shooting, you have to use the LCD screen to make changes; when you push the burst button (which is a very nice thing to have), the only change menu appears on the LCD, not in the viewfinder.--The D3200, like many other cameras, has a tendency to overexpose.  This is easy to remedy by setting EV at -2/3 or so.--Leave the in-camera sharpening on; images are very soft without it.--Bracketing, histogram, DOF preview: all missing.  These aren't fatal flaws, but the rest of the camera had better be very good to compensate.The bad:--IQ is a major disappointment.  I have a number of standard shots that I take with every camera I try or buy; I have done this so many times that I have a very clear idea of what is possible and what reasonable expectations are.  Again, I'm comparing this camera specifically with the K-5 (16mp on an APS-C sensor, kit lens 55-300mm) and the FZ150 (superzoom, 12mp on a small 1/2.3 sensor).  Recent experiences with the K-r (12mp, APS-C), the Canon T2i (kit zoom lens) and the Fujifilm S100fs (11mp, 2/3in sensor, bridge zoom camera) also enter into my appraisal.In every one of my standard shots, the D3200 performed worse (in terms of IQ) than the K-5 (and K-r) and often worse than the FZ150.  When shooting at full zoom, definition was poor and fine details were often fuzzy or smeared.  With in-camera noise reduction turned off, noise was often evident.  With either of the other two cameras at full zoom, you generated an image that allowed you to count the roof tiles on a house well over half a mile away, and read license plates at 400 to 500 yards.  The K-r was the same, and the Fuji S100 was close.  The D3200 does not have this capability.You might say, well, sure, it's probably the fault of the kit lens.  But my K-5 has a kit lens, and the FZ150 itself IS a kit lens, as was the Fuji S100fs, and they all did better on the same shots.  At any rate, the D3200 doesn't seem like a hot enough camera to warrant spending serious money to put top-quality glass on it.  And again, the K-5 didn't require this, nor did the K-r.You might also say, well, yeah, but who shoots all day at 300mm?  I don't know, but why limit yourself right from the start?  If the camera/lens combo can't do this, I'm going to miss out on a lot of shots.Apparently, I'm not the only one who is underwhelmed by the images from the D3200.  Here's what dpreview had to say on the subject: \"resolution and detail aside the Nikon D3200 has no image quality issues of note.\"  Hardly a ringing endorsement of the camera's IQ.Bottom line: the purpose of making pictures is to get good results, and the main ingredient is IQ.  I will take a couple of days to try some adjustments and see if I can get better results, but if it's this much harder than it is with my other cameras, I'm not optimistic.IQ is closely related to pixel size; in general smaller pixel size can be detrimental, and the D3200 has pixels that are quite small for a DSLR.Larger pixels offer enhanced light gathering ability and a higher signal-to-noise ratio.  Higher pixel counts on the same size sensor create a tradeoff.  To use one common metaphor that equates pixels to light-gathering \"buckets,\" having more, but smaller buckets (pixels) on the same surface area (sensor size) doesn't mean you can collect more water (light).  In fact, the shape and necessary circuitry of each pixel create wasted, non-light gathering areas in addition to generating electronic noise.Here's how Wikipedia puts it:  \"The size of the image sensor, or effective light collection area per pixel sensor, is the largest determinant of signal levels that determine signal-to-noise ratio and hence apparent noise levels ...more pixels within a given sensor area will make the image noisier.\"Here's a comparison of pixel sizes for a number of DSLR cameras.  The D800 is a full-frame, 36mp camera; the others are APS-C (a generic term which includes slightly differing surface areas and proportions).Pixel size in microns (\u00b5m)Pentax K-r - 12mp - 5.42 \u00b5mNikon D3100 - 14mp - 4.94 \u00b5mNikon D800 - 36mp - 4.88 \u00b5mPentax K-5 - 16mp - 4.8 \u00b5mNikon D5100  - 16mp - 4.78\u00b5mCanon Rebel T3i - 18mp - 4.3 \u00b5mNikon D3200 - 24mp - 3.85 \u00b5m", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "FOR THE MONEY", "Author": "LTCRET \"real person\"", "ReviewID": "R2QC0PL89FUEA0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I do like it. It really is a glorified point and shoot. If you want it to shine get some really good lens.  Reality is lens make the camera more than camera makes the lens. Good lens will cost about or more than the cost of the 3200. My advice if you hate changing lens is to get this then the 18-300 macro zoom. Yes it is heavy but you will not have to carry four or five lens like I do.  That lens is a decent all around but not a good anything. Also get either a GOOD monopod or tripod. I have one of each but use the monopod more than the tripod. Remember their is a limit to what you can carry and you will miss a lot of great pics changing lens, putting on a tripod etc. The VR is terribly over rated. Take every photography course you can, learn you camera and how to set up your pic.  BTW Canon makes a camera that is similar. And cannon, usually has better lens though pricy.

It takes very high quality pictures with just the default lens, but get a better lens and prepare to drop your pants after each and every photo.Seriously, for the price this is a damn fine piece of equipment. Now, the lens that came with the camera had a very noticeable smudge inside it, but it doesn't seem to affect my pictures in any way that I can see. The smudge is inside the lens, so I can't get to it. (Or at least I'm not sure how to get to it)Other than the smudge, I love this camera. I've been taking pictures of everything and everyone I can. So much so that I've been banned from most places with people in them. Now I'm stuck taking incredibly crisp close up pictures of my cat because she doesn't run away. But even if she did, this camera has an excellent action shot option so I could get a non-blurry photo of the cat's escape.If you have the money to spare, then go for a higher tier camera. I'm sure the results from that would blow your mind even more than this. But this is an excellent camera for its price, so if you're in the market for one then buy this beauty.Now I shall retire back to my dungeon and take pictures of the people that couldn't run away fast enough.

The D3200 has a sensor which makes it better than D3100 & D3000, which are now very affordable.  As a online news provider, I needed quality photos as well as video for local events.  I have used quality point-and-shoot digital cams for awhile, which actually are not that bad, but has a limitation in controlling the shots & adding more quality.  I was at 16megapixels on point&shoot;, but D3200 has 24megapixels, which isn't necessary a benefit of quality, but more size of the image.  My other option was The D5100 which looks attractive, too (esp. $50 cheaper than this D3200).  From research, the D5200 is coming out soon & this product should be much cheaper next year. Also, The Canon is a great competitor with each brand having its own advantages & disadvantages from color, accessories, & quality.  SInce I needed video, the Canon T3i & T4i was my second choice.  Since I was offered free 1day shipping, this concluded my search & within 14hrs, I had my new NIKON camera!  Great deal Amazon!

The major difference between these two cameras is the D3200's new Sony sensor with much higher resolution; 24MP vs 14MP for the D3100.  The LCD screen on the D3200 also appears brighter and sharper than the D3100 LCD and about the same as the D5100 (but not movable like the D5100 LCD Screen).  Notwithstanding the different sensors, the photographs taken with each camera (especially at lower ISO settings) look almost identical.  I have reviewed the D3100 seperately here on Amazon.  Photographs taken with the D3200 are richly saturated and highly detailed.  An external flash with bounce capabilities (ie SB-400) greatly enhances expsoure and color indoors.  The only quibbles I have (and this is also true for the D3100 and D5100) is the automatic white balance bias towards yellow under incandescent lighting resulting in an artificially warm look. Manual adjustment of the white balance provides better color accuracy under artificial lighting.  There is no dedicated white balance button or white balance bracketing option.  Also, the D3200 tends to overexpose quite a bit outdoors (similar to previous lower end Nikons) but doesn't underexpose indoors as the D3100 sometimes does.  The overexposure is easily fixed by adjusting the exposure compensation or by spot metering. There is no exposure bracketing option.  The AutoFocus on the D3200, like every other Nikon DSLR I have ever used, is very quick and accurate under all lighting conditions.  This camera (as does the D3100 & D5100) uses the EN-EL14 battery.  Only a battery actually manufactured by Nikon ($40+) and not a generic 3rd party battery will work.  Consequently, having a spare battery is a bit of a luxury with this camera.  The megapixel count of the D3200 may be overkill for most people especially this camera's target audience.  The D3100 14 megapixel count (D5100 16 MP) is more than sufficient unless you plan to print highway billboards. The file size of .jpg files generated by the D3200 is over 12MB (almost the size of the D40's raw files).  An advantage of these larger resolution files is the ability to crop photographs without any issue of having a small remaining file size.  The extra megapixels does NOT improve the image quality or amount of detail being captured.  The dynamic range of this camera (the difference between the brightest and darkest part of the picture that show detail) for .jpg files is excellent and appears about the same as the D3100 and D5100 at base ISO using the kit lens (and Active D-Lighting turned on).  There is a downside to the D3200's higher resolution; a bit of increased visible noise at high ISO levels specifically at ISO 1600 and 3200.  Comparing photographs taken on identical subjects at identical conditions using the same lens at 1600 or 3200 ISO on the D3100 and D3200, shows a little cleaner photographs on the D3100 (and the D5100).  Reducing the file size from \"Large\" to \"Normal\" does improve things a bit; perhaps this setting lowers the MP count.  In this context, it would be helpful if there was more than one ISO stop between 800 and 3200 (there is just one stop at 1600) as well as a dedicated ISO button so that one didn't have to navigate through a menu to adjust the ISO.  In summary, the D3200 is a very nice camera capable of taking very sharp photographs.  Like all cameras, the most important component is the skill and imagination of the photographer.  The D3200 is not a worthwhile upgrade in my opinion from the D3100 unless you place great importance on the ability to crop a very small portion of a photograph.  The D3100 and D5100, which are both less expensive than the D3200, are simply better cameras for most people. Incidentally,  I did not use the video or live view so obviously I can not comment on these features.6-4-12 UPDATE:  Within the last day or so, CNET and Cameralabs.com have each issued their respective comprehensive reviews of the D3200.  These are the first actual reviews by a major web site of the D3200 that I am aware of.  These reviews confirm that although the D3200 has some improved specifications over the D3100 (higher resolution for sure), the image quality of the older (and less expensive) D3100 is better than the D3200.  Specifically CameraLabs rated the image quality of the D3100 18/20 and the image quality of the D3200 17/20.  Consequently if image quality and value are important criteria, the D3100 should be given strong consideration over the D3200.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Friendly Camera!", "Author": "XER888", "ReviewID": "R3T5PSHTG8C57L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After debating whether to go with Canon T4i, Pentax X5, and the D3200, I was sold on the idea that D3200 comes in \"red\" - no, seriously. As my wife and I have no idea how to use a SLR camera.  We have always bought Canon point and shoot cameras and have never use any of the dials other than \"Auto\". But we decided that it's time for a SLR since we are expecting our first \"little monster\" in a couple of months in order to capture those special moments.  We had no idea about the specs except that there seems to be a war between the \"Canon\" people vs. \"Nikon\" people.  All of the cameras sound pretty much the same for us so we based our decision mainly based on the camera being red; and friends have made fun of me since.I was always impress with the posted pix from Amazon users...especially the \"bokeh\" (blurry background) pixes and that was the first thing I wanted to do when I received the camera two days ago. In short, the camera is very easy to use. I was able to do a \"bokeh\" in less than an hour by just dialing the selector to \"Guide\" and following the instructions on the LCD, and still I don't know what is aperture, \"F\", or anything like that.  I truly believe that this camera has enough functions for you to delve into and take shots that are as professionals as some of the ones that are posted here; all it takes is practice!!!I am sure if I had bought the Canon or Pentax, I would still be blown away from coming from a point and shoot camera. I really think any one of the cameras would suffice and I think it all come down to preference.  For us, it was the color \"red\" because we were tired researching.  If there are any suggestions I can give, I would say go find a camera and put it in your hands for the look and feel to see if it's suitable.I also want to give props to Roberts Inc.

It was a little intimidating when I first got it a year ago and I put it away for almost 8 months, preferring my Pentax point and shoot, because there were fewer settings.  I took this one out of the back pack again in November and determined to learn how to use it.It takes fantastic low light shots and it gives great product shots for my website using the product tent with full spectrum CFBs.  I'm a total noobie with Digital SLR, even though I used to take photos with a Pentax K1000 and develop my own film.  Digital SLR is nothing like the old Pentax.I also use this camera to take landscape shots and live animal shots.  It does a really good job with both.  Some of my landscape shots look like paintings, the focus is so crisp, and the light play with the camera is really attractive.  It has a fast shutter speed for action shots and to catch moving animal shots, like seals leaping to grab a herring out of your hand.  I haven't mastered the grandchild shots yet, though.The pictures are 6 to 8 mb in size and give lots of room for editing using the built in editing tools.  The video is good and the built in microphone is better than the one in my Flip video camera (which stopped working this Fall).The camera has a learning curve.  I'm not going to outgrow this camera for a long time.  I'd recommend getting one of the camera guides to shorten your learning time, if you've never used an SLR digital camera before.I still haven't learned how to fully utilize all the bells and whistles, but now I'm determined to learn.Buy a sturdy tripod for it.

It was a jump from 35, but the D3200 is fantastic. I'm getting great details and vibrant colors after just a little time shooting. The images are clear and crisp from 100 to 3200 ISO/ASA with slightly noticeable noise around 6400.One thing to note is that, if you don't know how to completely utilize the camera, the images will be bad, or underwhelming. I recommend trying to familiarize yourself with some of the slightly more advanced features. After using a completely manual 35 I had no problem diving into some of these features and they helped a lot. Try to stay away from the auto features and go into shutter priority, aperture priority, and manual shutter modes.The image effects are present, but I wouldn't say any of them are particularly impressive. Yes you can give your image a sort of older appearance, but if that's the kind of shooting you go for regularly, I would recommend just using an old camera and some expired film.I would recommend this camera to most people who are looking at entering the DSLR market. I take that back. If you'rte looking to get into DSLR, this is a great choice. One note, just because the MP is twice some other cameras, doesn't mean the pictures are twice as good right away.

My previous camera is a Canon PowerShot S3 IS, which I cherished until the noise in the still photos started bothering me more and more.  I can barely see my son's face in some of the photos when lighting is not optimal.  The PowerShot S3 is a great video camera, and I got that camera right before my son was born so I could record lots of videos of him.  It has handled that job admirably.  The PowerShot does not record video in HD, however.That's when I started eyeing the Canon T3i and T2i.  After a year of shopping and researching, I decided to give Nikon a chance.  Perhaps I was partially persuaded by my Nikon fanboy cousin, who is a professional photographer for twenty years.  All the rave reviews on Nikon cameras also helped me cinch the decision.  The fact that the D3200 offers an unprecedented 24 MP for an entry level DSLR is the final nail.I am extremely impressed by the image quality right off the bat.  Having a decent lens that comes with the camera body probably makes the biggest difference between the D3200 and the S3, but I am sure having four times more megapixels doesn't hurt either.On the downside, while D3200 can record true HD videos, but autofocus capability leaves a lot to be desired.  It does not seem as responsive as the S3, and the lens motor is extremely noisy ([...]).I may resort to using the S3 primarily to record videos and the D3200 to shoot stills, which is not the most efficient system.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kind of pricey...", "Author": "Michael Howell", "ReviewID": "R1R5ZY3AX7F3UR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "...for what it is.

Why only four stars? And why I want to return it...OK, there is a huge deal breaker for me - no FP mode. Yes, I know, it's totally my fault, I should read spec more carefully. I bought this camera in a single click after reading a general spec. I have the d90 and was interesting in more cropping ability, I don't care about video, I have a good camcorder, but I do need a better low light performance with higher ISO. My d90 is best camera ever, but I don't like to go with it above iso 400, even with ISO 400 noise is noticeable.I'm not a pro. I'm just taking pictures of my  18  months daughter, a lot of pictures, almost every day.I mostly do it at home and use sb-900 flash with various lenses. And now you probably understand why high synchronization speed is so crucial for me. The d3200 allows you to shoot with  flash using 1/200 exposure or higher (slower), it's definitely not enough for my high speed baby :-)Also, imaging you are shooting portrait against a sun, you have to use a fill flash and you also want to preserve thin DOF to get a nice blurry background, it is also impossible with d3200.About pictures quality - I didn't notice significant difference between d3200 and d90. My old and lovely d90 still very sharp. I've tried  Nikkor 50/1.8g and Sigma 17-50/2.8. In terms of sharpness and focus accuracy my 50 mm is doing better on d90, Sigma is my flagship for indoor shooting is doing pretty similar and very well on both bodies. I have not tried 18-200vr yet, I'm planning to try it over the next weekend. I also have a 60mm d macro and 105mm/f2 love to use them on d90, but they are both D and will not auto focus on d3200. The only gain that I see with using d3200 it's a much lower noise between ISO 400 and 1600 (compare to d90), but don't go higher. D3200 produces better colors and of course much more details (thanks to 24mp sensor). I didn't play with raw on d3200.Almost forgot, the face recognition is not that good compare to even some p&s;, many times d3200 focus has been jumped between my daughter face and her toys, especially balls. I also like 3d tracking in my d90 much more, it's more accurate. The d3200 is not always can predict movement direction and set focus correct in 3d mode.So, I have pretty mixed feeling about d3200. It's a nice camera and could be a perfect walk around camera, this is a good and light backup camera, this is even nice prime camera if you don't use flash much as I do. But it doesn't work for me. Just one more feature and this camera could be a champion, but no FP HSS means no deal for me.Sorry Amazon, I'm really love your  30 days return policy, It's not my usual practice, but this time I have to return this little baby, it doesn't feet my needs.Bottom line: I would recommend this camera as a first slr camera to people who want to advance their photography experience and people who like to control their cameras settings.

It's really a lot of fun to use and feels well built.I got the D3200 a few months ago. The picture quality is excellent but video recording is no good. Video focusing is the issue. The focus is very slow, and the stock lens makes a lot of noise when focusing. When I record moving people I usually resort to manually focusing the lens. Also, the D3200 also can only record 1080 at a maximum of 30fps, which is very noticeable when compared to 60fps - especially when recording rapidly moving subjects. At 30fps moving objects seem jittery and move unnaturally. Due to these issues, I use my iPhone almost exclusively for video. I didn't expect a DSLR to take perfect video, but I assumed it would be better than my cell phone. I break out the D3200 usually only in low light conditions. I also feel that the videos are soft.The extremely slow focusing has made the camera useless for recording video. Imagine this, you are focused on a subject and the person moves two feet farther from the camera, the camera does not realize this and does nothing. So, you hold down the shutter button which tells the camera to refocus. Now the camera cycles through being completely unfocused to properly focused - this gives me a headache when I watch it later. So obtrusive.The photo quality is excellent. The only gripe I have is the custom white balance - you must go through numerous menus every time you want to adjust it.

Basically I've read up on it and the D3200 doesn't support metering... so now I have to purchase a new set of lenses to make it work seamlessly without putting the D3200 in \"M\" mode and adjusting the aperture manually (keep in mind this is for my wife and she wants simple).  More can be found here, ug! [...]If I would've known this I may have opted for a Canon.The red is nice, but my wife already put a very small chip in the paint (and we don't know how as she's normally very careful with it).  Basically the black camera housing on our past D100 was way more durable and even after all these years - has no chips in it what-so-ever and looks entirely brand new.  Not sure if this speaks for the quality of the housing but it should as it's lacking.It takes great pictures, and we're not professional photographers.

I already have a SONY NEX 5n and a PAnasonic GF3 and for the price i thought this camera was a great buy based on reviews I have seen on the web. I think this is a good camera for the entry level range of users who are upgrading to a DSLR. I see a lot of people boast about the size of the camera being a lot smaller then most other DSLRs and all I can say is the other cameras must be monsters because this is not a small camera by any means.I gave this camera 4stars because i think it is a very capable camera for the price and I didn't think it fair to give a lower rating because of my bias towards the Micro 4/3 cameras. I am not a professsional but I am getting into photography more and more. To be honest I didn't think the video when taken in lower lighting indoors was that great and every picture taken indoors with fairly well lit lighting during the day wasn't the most crisp pictures i have taken. I used Aperture priority without a flash and had the aperture open fully and let the camera do the ISO and shutter. My Panasonic GF3 and SONY NEX seemed to get better results. I have to say it was nice to look through a viewfinder again as my last cameras were all in a LiveView type of config.As far as the build and fell of the camera it seemed pretty cheap feeling. I had to go for the red color because i thought it was nice to have a different look to it other then black. Hey, if you want pretty picture you ned a pretty camera right? lol. It has a cheap plastic feel to it but it wasn't a show stopper by any means. I don't see myself dragging this camera to get pictures on a daily basis. More of a specialty kind of usage because of its size. The Micro 4/3 i can take anywhere more easily and it does the same thing even better.I just want to say after reading a lot of reviews on AMazon and elsewhere I truly believe that only a couple people mentioned that you can take great pictures with a point and shoot and a DSLR for everyday use. If all your doing is going around taking shots of your friends drinking beer and partying then most cameras would do the trick but if you want a night shot of the moon or fireworks or Christmas lights you will need a DSLR with all the programming modes. One other key thing i have heard people preach about photography is it's all about the glass in front of the sensor. Mostly true as a good lens can make a difference.My next purchase will be a mid range camera or high end one when I get better at picture taking. I dread trying to find a camera when I am ready, 16, 18 , 24 megapixels.. this one has external mic, this one doesn't, this one has bracketing but why did they remove it from this camera, this one has 1080 in 30, 24, this one has noise at 1600 ISO.. blah blah blah. OMG shoot me now. Too much choice clouds judgement.If I owned a camera company i would make two types of  cameras, one entry level and one Pro with all the features. It's crazy all the different models every manufacturer has out there, ridiculous.In the end I returned this camera because i like my two Micro 4/3 cameras and well..

Thank you Amazon!I'm disappointed at some of the reviewers boasting they feel they got a D800 at a D3200 price.  This is STILL a D3200, and is meant for a very large, but very neophyte audience.  Nikon knew there were millions looking for a DSLR for $500 - maybe so they could say they had one.  Well here it is, and believe me you get what you pay for.  If you believe the egos of the prior reviewers, you'll certainly be disappointed when you try take this camera out of the simple, picture-led guide mode.True, this camera is very much entry-level, but it's REAL entry level.  And the 24mp does not look like 24mp - unfortunately the way the computer processes the image it ends up looks more like 8mp.  The images are hard to describe - it's like they're synthesized or over manipulated.  Even the RAW seems compressed and lossy.  I saw a side-side close up analysis/review of the image, and although it's 24mp, most of the pixels in, say, a 20 pixel radius are all the same!  The camera doesn't have the power to distinguish the pixels for clarity like the higher end cameras.  Point and shoots do this as a matter of course, then they brag they have \"24mp\" etc which may be misleading some into thinking \"well 24mp is still 24mp\".  But it's not.  Go do your online homework and look at the analysis photos from this camera.  You'll see what I mean - and that pans out in real life.  Just one step up, the D7000 is 10x the camera, and yields much brighter photos.  It's sort of like an old round 50's style TV vs a new 90\" hi res LED TV.It's plastic case gives it a chintzy feel, it's VERY slow at shot acquisition (you will certainly wait a bit till it's figured out how to take the shot), autofocus is awful even with $3000 glass, metering is whacked, short battery life you name a bad trait and this camera has it.  Oh - and don't get caught in the rain with it either.However, it is lightweight.  And to some that's quite important.  Like a tourist that has to lug a his new SLR all over creation, when they're used to a little pocket camera.  This camera is 1/2 the weight of any DSLR.And it also has a real dumbed-down \"guide\" that takes about 30 seconds to setup a shot - so that whole sophomoric 7th-grade level guide thing is a bust.  And the scene selector on top doesn't help at all either.  In both my wife's, my 24 yr old son, my and my Mom's use, about 30/50 shots were blurred, mis-flashed, mis-exposed to WAY out of proportions etc.  So why have 24mp for a camera that can't handle it?The lens that it comes with (mandatory) is just more cheap plastic mess.  If this camera was sold w/o the lens it would be in the $299 range.  We put a $3k lens on this camera with little improvement - it still just can't cope.  Don't fool yourself into thinking you're clever by purchasing a $4000 camera for $400.  You've got a $400 camera.But I wouldn't waste your time/money - get the D7000 and be done with it.

I bought this camera in May and i finally got to unbox it in June.I had only use this camera for one day i started having problems with it.After charging the battery fully i decided to go and do a test run only to realized after a few hours the camera went blank on me.There i was thinking to myself that the battery might be the problem but knowing that i didn't get any warning.I then removed the battery and put it back in the camera after about a min then the camera came on with an error on screen \"error: press shutter release button again\". At that time i was not able to take any more photos and when i tried switching the camera to live view to record video the camera would just shut down,and i order for it to come back on i had to remove the battery and put it back again,that was the strangest thing i ever saw from a camera.I even tried removing the memory card but the error still came back,i even went on to resetting the camera but that didn't make a difference.I am about to send back this camera and i don't think want it service,am thinking about which one i might have to get instead.hope this problem gets rectified ASAP Nikon.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "d3200 camera", "Author": "C.

I think I would choose that one if I were doing it over.  I was trying to upgrade from a D40 which I totally loved.  I don't see much improvement, but then maybe that is because I have not used the camera much.  I should have gotten black maybe and I would like it more.  Mostly it just sits in its case.

I saw this camera on an ad on TV and since I would like to get a better camera, am thinking about this one.  About six months ago, my husband bought me a Nikon Coolpix 8510.  I am sure this is NOTHING AT ALL like the 3200..  Since I want to get into more photography but I am a newcomer and will be learning mostly on my own, would this be a camera for me?  I love to take scenery, portaits, etc. and would love to have a camera I can use with more options, but just want to be sure before I invest in this, if this would be something I could use relatively easily and learn on?  Any advice.  Thank you so much :) (Please excuse the 'rating' I had to give before I could leave this 'review')..  I have no idea what kind of rating I would give it since I don't own one..

The pictures taken from it were very disappointing and almost unusable, especially when compared against my D60 that it was supposed to be replacing. So I returned the \"bad copy\" and had amazon resend another one (great customer service by the way). Unfortunately the second D3200 was just as bad as the first one. SOOOO disappointed in Nikon.

It doesn't allow for bracketing of shots and anything you need to change seems to have be done through the menu screen in the camera.  It is very light.
