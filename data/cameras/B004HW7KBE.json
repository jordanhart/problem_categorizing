you're shooting (I've done that about a thousand times on my other cameras,) it's super-compact, has an optical telephoto lens, easy-to-navigate menus, and decent battery life.  But the thing that's most important to me: can I use it without worrying about which setting it's on?  Yep, I can.  It's a solid point-and-shooter.  You can set it on auto and it will take very nice pictures without the need for any fuddling with the menus.The video shows the quality of the photos.  They were taken at a New Orleans house museum where the lighting is varied and can be a little tricky.  The photos look great, especially the ones of the spiral staircase.  The detail is impressive.  This is a great little camera.I do like the large lcd touchscreen on my older Fuji Z700, but the picture quality seems a little better on the Lumix, so it's destine to become the camera that I carry in my bag for instant use.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Compact Lumix is a Perfect Companion", "Author": "TomK1 \"tomk1\"", "ReviewID": "R29JJNVFYL711U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH2 is a is part of the Lumix line of cameras.  Lumix cameras range from SLR-like sophistication to simple point and shoot meant for taking pictures of friends and family at get-togethers.  I've used cameras in the Lumix line for several years and I've always been pleased by quality of the pictures.  For some reason, the pictures from a Lumix really \"pop\" compared to other cameras.The DMC-FH2 is consistent with other Lumix cameras.  There are multiple scene modes available for control of your pictures, generally, you choose Intelligent Auto (IA) when you want to camera to choose the correct combination of flash, depth of field, focus points, and shutter speed.  You can also manually choose how the camera will operate based on scene type such as portrait, night photography, or landscape (there are many variations).Unlike others cameras in the Lumix line, this does not have a dedicated mode button; that is done scrolling through options on the screen.  The main disadvantage of this approach is that instead of a dedicated movie button, you must scroll to the correct mode on the screen.  I found this inconvenient and does not lend itself to quickly jumping into movie mode when the need arises.The zoom range isn't particularly wide at 5x, but given the compact dimensions of this camera, its reasonable.  It's sufficient for most uses, although it may leave you wishing for more range if you're travelling.  On the other hand, the zoom button is positioned nicely, so it's very easy to quickly frame your picture.  Shutter lag is non-existent.  The rest of the controls are consistent with the Panasonic line from the last 4-5 years which is a good thing.  All in all, the experience using it is overwhelmingly positive.The pictures themselves are excellent and well lit using either natural light or the fill-flash.  The 14M pixels (!) give you plenty pixels to blow-up, crop, or do editing, but keep in mind this is a small camera with a tiny lens, so don't expect to get sharp pictures if you blow the pictures up on your PC.  For most uses, I don't believe this will be an issue.Movies mode is a bit disappointing.  In addition to the control problems I mentioned previously, the camera will not zoom in or out once you start taking the movie.  Whatever the zoom position was when you started taking the movie, thats what you'll get.  I can't figure out why they added this limitation (motor noise from the zoom perhaps?), but its particularly frustrating and makes the movie function significantly less useful.  The good news is the movies are in QuickTime .mov format so should be readable and editable on either PC's or Macs in almost any picture or movie editing software.The screen, like all new Lumix cameras is big, bright and useful to determine if your last pictures was blurry.  Whatever Panasonic uses as the material for this screen is very scratch resistant.  I always carry the Lumix cameras in my pocket with no cover and the screens have never scratched.Battery life seems reasonable.  In standby mode, the batteries do not drain away too quickly, and in general use where you take 1-2 pictures, turn off the camera, then shut it off and repeat, I was able to go an entire weekend travelling and at party taking about 150 pictures and the camera's battery indicator showed full.In summary, this is a compact, well made camera that is perfect to carry along in a shirt pocket when a bulkier camera doesn't make sense.  If your photographic needs are simple, its a great one-and-only camera.  It has all the usual goodness of the Lumix line (sharp pictures, vibrant colors), an IA mode that will suit 90% of all point-and-shoot needs.  And the ability to manually choose a scene mode when the IA system isn't doing what you need.Pros:1) Consistently excellent pictures2) Small, compact3) Beautifully made4) Ease of use5) Intelligent Auto (IA) makes photography easy6) Control system maturityCons:1) No zoom in movie mode2) No dedicated movie button3) Somewhat limited zoom range", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Grant", "ReviewID": "RRGPYOPQQQSYE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera with the main intention of using it for digiscoping with a Vortex Razor spotting scope. The camera worked excellent for this purpose, no vignetting, easy to change ISO setting and it takes bright crisp images through the scope. I also have been using it as a pocket point and shoot camera and the pictures it takes are amazing. Macro shots of spring flowers are bright and crisp and I have taken some of my best coastal sunset pictures with this camera using the sunset feature. My other camera is a Nikon Coolpix S6000 and the Lumix has became my go to camera.Battery life seems good but I wish that it could be charged using the USB cable. You have to take the battery out of the camera and insert it into the wall charger.One reviewer said they had difficulty viewing the LCD screen on a bright day. I live in Nevada and we have a lot of bright days and I haven't had any trouble viewing the screen.I would recommend this camera for everyday general use and digiscoping.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Point & Shoot!", "Author": "Odds", "ReviewID": "RZM4DGV4IEI9H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first camera, so my #1 priority was to find a camera that was easy to use. The DMC-FH2 was just what I was looking for:- Small and lightweight, you can take it on the go just about anywhere (It's smaller and weighs less than my cell phone!).- It boots up and focuses quickly, so you can snap shots on the move without having to stop and wait for any longer than it takes you to press the shoot button.- The IA takes all the work out of taking decent (not blurry, not too dark, etc.) shots. There are various modes for taking better shots, but for my purposes the IA is perfect!- The battery life seems excellent. I took over 250 photos and shot a 30 second video and the battery still registered full. That seemed a little strange to me, since reviews had it pegged at an average of 270 shots before the battery runs down. But maybe my habit of quickly snapping shots extends the battery life?I took this camera on a day hike the other day and took over 250 photos with it. I only had to delete a couple due to blurriness. Most of my shots I simply pulled the camera out of my pocket, paused long enough to take the shot, and kept moving. Often I was barely waiting for the UI to show up on the LCD before shooting, but it seemed to handle it just fine. Now I have tons of stuff to share with friends and family on facebook!My only criticism is that the LCD isn't very helpful. I didn't even bother checking what my pictures looked like. The sun was too bright and the screen too small to really tell whether I got the shot. But I guess that's what you get with such a small camera. Not a big deal. Like I said, you won't have to worry about the IA not focusing properly and the image stabilization appears to work near-perfectly as well. So if you point the camera in the proper direction, you should get more or less what you're looking for!If you're looking for professional quality photos, this probably isn't the camera for you. But if you want a cheap compact camera for the purpose of taking shots on the go, then this one deserves a look. It helps that the price is pretty low, too!", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lumix love", "Author": "tirah", "ReviewID": "R2F22PS7A8H8EC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i own a Lumix LX3 and wanted to try another Lumix.

Then i came upon this beauty here that they call the Lumix Fh2.  Im liking it so far, it looks great and works great.  There is no lag when you take a picture, which I noticed on the Canon.

I was worried when I didn't see many reviews for this camera so I took a couple days to do some research and I couldn't find a bad review anywhere. I got the camera and am so glad I did. I have been using it for two days now since I got it. At first I was a bit disappointed that to charge the battery you had to take it out and put it in the charger but after really thinking about it (and doing it twice) it dawned on me how nice that is if you have more than one battery, you can charge one and use the other. Charging them doesn't take long either. It is slimmer than I expected, perfect size. The resolution is fabulous, the modes are great. I have already taken some of my favorite pictures ever. Mid-range camera with high-end features. HIGHLY recommended!", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "That's The One", "Author": "M. Gerrish", "ReviewID": "RC1L5JRMCYOOG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like a pocket camera, mostly because phone cameras are really only good for recording a fender bender, and because it isn't always convenient to tote a big DSLR around (especially since I keep a long lens in place). I can discreetly pull a pocket camera from my purse and get a close-up of the fabulous anniversary dinner at the swanky restaurant. Or a great shot of me and my sibs at a backyard barbecue.In theory.Problem is, those shots generally require a flash, which I really dislike, so I lose a lot of shots to \"dim light-blur.\" I hate it when that happens. So I lusted for a better pocket camera.I don't care about digital zoom. Megapixels? At this point, unless you're shooting for billboards, anything over 10mp is more than enough. I don't care if a camera has a front facing window to see myself while I apparently take a picture of me. What? And I don't need any auto-upload feature to a social networking site.I want enough sensor punch to work well in dim light. I want it to do a superb job with macro so I can zero in on the food! (I love food shots, such great memories.) I don't want a load of pixel \"noise\" getting in the way in any circumstance. And I want it to fit comfortably in my pocket or purse.So the Panasonic Lumix enters. After charging the battery, I went into a closet, set the camera on macro and took a closeup of the stitching on a suitcase. As one would expect, the photo was horribly underexposed, practically black. But using graphics software, I lifted the exposure and I was delighted to see that the stitching was in focus. Dark closet. Tiny subject. In focus. Imagine if I cared about the stitching! This is excellent, because my former pocket camera would automatically slow the shutter speed (no choice on my part) to allow enough light to get the shot, but without a tripod, the blur would make the shot useless.I quibble with this -- when I took indoor action shots of my grandson with the camera set on Intelligent Scene (auto-mode), his skin didn't look pixelated, but weirdly mottled. I had much better results by manually selecting the scene. There are many scene options and they all seem to work really well. Even in dim light! And it does a great job of stopping a moving target (did I mention the grandson?).The Lumix is small, about the size of my smart phone, but the view screen is large enough and you can zoom in during playback to make sure you got the shot you want. The controls are self-explanatory and easy to operate. I did not load any of the software into my computer, but simply connected the camera to my PC with the supplied USB and the drivers loaded automatically. Of course it will connect to an ordinary tripod (if one must).Oh, the flash, you ask? It's just as unpleasant as the flash on every pocket camera, although it's a quick couple of flicks to turn it on or off. And using the option to avoid red-eye (instead of full-on flash) dims the flash just enough to be not entirely hideous. Presto!Even at a higher price point, this camera is a great deal. Start shooting!", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Veeeery nifty wittle Point & Shoot camera thingy", "Author": "P. STEWART \"Patrick Stewart (NOT the Star Tre...", "ReviewID": "R2TWP6QSQJF7SC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Deal:I was lucky enough to get this little camera for around $85.00 here on Amazon. (Chose the red one btw.) I think I made a very good selection. Not only was that a great price but it's also a great camera. If you need a basic (with some cool bells & whistles) point & shooter and don't want to spend toooo much...this is the perfect one to consider.Construction & Durability:Can't obviously comment on the life & complete durability of it yet since I've only had it since January of 2012. But, so far so good. It's constructed well and feels very solid. I think the shell is probably made of anodized aluminum. The buttons and switches all feel durable. I have to say that I really love having a switch instead of a button to power on the camera too. For me that's a plus.Speed:It's a very fast camera. All the functions (processing, flash recharge, etc.) work smoothly & quickly. It's...sparky!Battery Life:When taking pics at the highest setting (14MP) and with IA (Intelligent Auto) engaged it gets very good battery life with the included 680mAh, 3.6V one. For taking HD videos however...that's what sucks the power cell fast. You'll definitely need a higher capacity battery (& maybe an extra just in case) to shoot a significant amount of video. Unfortunately the Panasonic batteries are not cheap. Fortunately I did find a great 3rd party replacement for it from Wasabi. It's double the capacity and not very costly. Seen it for $8.99 with free shipping. Works perfectly and \"feels\" like the original battery too. Here's the link--Wasabi Power Battery for Panasonic DMW-BCK7, DMW-BCK7E, DMW-BCK7PP, NCA-YN101F, NCA-YN101G, NCA-YN101H, Lumix DMC-FH2, DMC-FH5, DMC-FH7, DMC-FH25, DMC-FH27, DMC-FP5, DMC-FP7, DMC-FS16, DMC-FS18, DMC-FS22, DMC-FS35, DMC-FS37, DMC-FX77, DMC-FX78, DMC-FX90...Picture & Video:It takes very crisp & clear photos and the 720p HD videos look great. As for it not taking good pictures in low light like some have suggested...I'd say you're not adjusting the camera correctly or using the proper IA mode. Plus, low light pics can be kind of a crap shoot with MOST cameras, from cheaper point & clickers to expensive SLR's. For a below $200.00 camera this sucker does pretty well in my opinion.Memory Cards & Stuff:Since it only comes with a piffly 70 megabytes built in you'll need a good memory card. I'd recommend Kingston or Sandisk cards. Neither of those have failed me yet. Also you'll need to get at least a Class 4 card if you're going to be shooting video with this thing. The documentation recommends Class 6 or higher but I've found that the 4 is fast enough to catch the video. The HD movie mode shoots at about 30 Frames Per Second. According to the people who know about this kinda stuff, Class 4 is perfect for 30 FPS videos. For more than 30 you'll need higher. Oh yeah...and class 4 cards are still much cheaper than 6 & up.

Never taken a class. Never owned a particularly expensive camera. But everyone needs a point-and-shoot even in this age of cell phone cameras. For years I've been a Canon Powershot user. My second is still in good working order and in spite of its bulk I will continue using it. I was really excited, however, to give the Panasonic Lumix a try. It has lots of features my old Powershot just doesn't have and double the MP.As just a point-and-shoot the Lumix is very easy to use. It's easy to take great photos without much more than pressing the button. I do find that the auto-flash goes off considerably more often than I would like it to. Fortunately it's easy to quickly turn it off.If you're interested in learning more about the art of photography it's also easy to change your other settings. I took some really cool pictures of my kids on Independence Day playing with sparklers and shooting off other fireworks. Snapping photos in the dark at a slower shutter speed was something I'd never been able to try with my previous cam because the screen is so small and the controls confusing. The Lumix is definitely user friendly in that department.The actual picture quality... honestly 14.1 MP is insanely big. I think that contributes to the slow speed of take and loading but the photos look great. I've taken several photos of things I wouldn't normally bother with just for the purpose of reviewing and plenty of shots of my toddler running around. Considering my lack of training in the do's and don't's of photography most of my photos have turned out really lovely. Outdoor shots come out vivid and crisp. Indoor shots occasionally have red-eye and not all motion shots come out great, but generally most are good. Going through about 250 photos I would say there are only about a dozen that aren't good based on technical issues (ie. red-eye, blurring, graininess).The Shake Detector and Image Stabilization is by far my favorite feature of the camera. I've had other cameras with this that did well but the Lumix's is by far superior. I have VERY shaky hands. Always have. It's frustrating when taking photos so this feature is the first thing I look at when camera shopping and I would recommend the Lumix based on this feature alone. It does make the camera slower to snap a photo and sucks up battery life but if you also suffer from severely shaky hands I can't recommend this camera enough.My only real deal-breaker, that would keep me (personally) from wanting to purchase this camera, is the rechargable battery. While it lasts quite a while I've had it run out when I was out at the park. Unlike other cameras I've had there's no quick replacement tucked away in my camera bag when I run out. That said it's obviously intended to make the camera thinner and lighter. That's definitely something you, as the consumer, have to make a choice on. I like the light, very portable size of the Lumix but am really forgetful about charging batteries so it loses a star for that.Overall this is a very good camera that takes beautiful pictures with minimal effort. I've been surprisingly impressed and begun to use my old camera less and less as I get used to this one. For taking 'still life' photos (as I do for my blogs and reviews from time to time) I've never had a camera compare even closely to this one. For the price range I think you're getting an exceptionally high quality camera and if it weren't for the battery not meeting my needs I could have said I loved it. Highly recommended for folks with shaky hands, who take a lot of outdoor photos or still object shots, or who desire portability and don't mind recharging the battery.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Great Camera for On-the-Go!", "Author": "JD Cetola", "ReviewID": "R3P8UI3BEKE920", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Panasonic FH2 Lumix camera is one of the best I've seen/used when it comes to packing a punch in a small package.  This is a sleek and easy to transport camera--smaller than most phones (even flip phones).  It's easy to use and takes great pictures as well.  There is a lot to like and little to complain about:Likes--size (a huge plus, this really is a small camera), 14.1 Megapixels, 1280x720p HD video capable, on/off switch is difficult to accidentally trigger, battery life is excellent, 70MB built-in memory, Face Detection Auto Focus/Exposure feature (reduces blurring due to focus on other objects), and Intelligent ISO Motion Detection Sensor (a nice feature that reduces blurring due to motion).Complaints--very few, but to get nitpicky, the 4X optical zoom is too weak, the LCD is often difficult to see in bright light (although it is a good size for this small camera), and access to video (as opposed to camera mode) takes a couple of steps.  As I said, these are very minor complaints.This is a great camera and is perfect for those who like to take their camera everywhere.

I was climbing the south couloir of Mount Quandary with a buddy. We were post-holing in deep early June snow (yes, we were using snowshoes, but still post-holing pretty badly), when my right foot sunk in fast; I was up to my crotch in snow and, in my flailing attempt to arrest my fall so I wouldn't start an uncontrolled fall down the mountain, I managed to knock my camera case loose from it's velcro strap and I watched helplessly as my Lumix tumbled down the south face, bouncing off the crusty snow all the way down. Having fought my way up that far (we were 3/4 the way to the summit at this point), I was not about to go down and get it, so I considered it lost. Well, my buddy looked at 14ers.com the next day and lo and behold, a climber had found my camera, with no case in sight, sticking out of the snow. I called him to ID my camera and he told me it still worked! I picked it up the next day (luckily the guy lived near Denver), and sure enough, IT WORKED. I used that camera for another 3 years before it finally started to give up the ghost, and I bought a new one a month ago. So far, so good on this one; it works as well as the previous one, and is smaller and lighter to boot. And it still features the high-quality Leica lens that the previous one had.

I particularly liked the \"panorama assist\", which allows you to knit together several adjacent images for a wide scene.  The absolute best feature (which I did not know existed, but was so thankful later that it does) is that when taking a video, the camera makes a still picture of the initial shot.  On a number of occasions, I mistakenly left the camera in video mode and wanted to take a still shot, and I got my still shot anyway.The only knock I have on this camera is the small amount of built-in memory--they tout the 70 MB of built-in memory as if this somehow a great feature.

With the old Cybershots I could blow up the images on my computer monitor and see that they were soft and somewhat grainy due to the lack of light, but the Lumix images have major grain and in general it's harder to get a good low light shot with it. The Lumix is better than the Sony (DSC-W510 is the one I tested most recently) but still much worse than previous Cybershots I purchased 2, 4, 6 years ago.That said I haven't had this camera long enough to learn all its quirks, but so far this has been another in a line of recent disappointments with what point-and-shoot small digital cameras are available right now.Thinking maybe I should have gone with a comparably-priced Canon?

Flash helps indoors, but only if the thing you're trying to take a picture of is 5-10 feet away.

The 4x optical zoom gives a better quality zoom (before going into digital zoom) than the 3x zoom I had on my last camera, especially at lower resolutions.  I found that for the majority of my photos, I was fine with the camera set at 7 megapixels or less for close subjects and indoor use.  This helped the write speed of the picture and reduce file size.  The 720p video capture is great too, but also more than I needed in close quarters and is hard on file size and battery life.  For the times that I did need to go beyond the 4x optical zoom into the digital zoom range (outdoors and covering longer distances), having the higher 14mp resolution, image stabilization and motion detection features came in very handy -and necessary- for zoomed in images that were not blurry from camera movement (which is greatly magnified with amount of zoom used).I recommend taking the time to really learn all the features and how to access them.  As an old manual 35mm SLR user, I found that I could better control the images when I manually adjusted the settings for live action and shutter speed, such as panning movement during sports or other live events.  I also recommend getting a very high speed memory card if you plan to shoot a lot of high-res pictures and video.  For most people, 14mp is overkill for birthday party snapshots (unless you plan to blow them up to mural size) when 3mp would do, but having the high resolution is great when shooting outdoors or at distances and wanting the ability to zoom into an area of the picture later and crop out the excess, without having to worry about image pixelation or graininess from over-zooming.

That is true, but how many times with those cameras have you accidentally gotten into a mode that isn't automatic and you can't get out?  This camera has so few modes that you almost cannot make a mistake.  It doesn't even have a format for the SD card.  Only delete single, multi and all.  You don't really need to know a lot to use this camera.The two main switches on/off, record/play are actually switches.  Which means they are either in the on or off, or play or record, not the \"did I press that button or not\" mode.I took over 100 test pictures.  They included: Full sunlight, shade, shade with fill flash, indoors, indoors with flash.  I tried different mega-pixel sizes of the images.Every shot was good, not great.  Not one of the pictures was truly super sharp.  I took a picture of a car across the street in full sunlight, zoomed in.  Viewing at 1:1 on my computer, I could easily read everything on the license plate, but there was no sharpness to the picture.  Everything was a little soft, like shooting through a very thin layer of gauze.No matter how easy a camera is to use, if it doesn't take good pictures, then it is not a good camera.  A lot of picture taking is the photographer.  A big responsibility of the photographer is not to move while taking the picture.  Sometimes that is very hard to small cameras or hard to press switches. For this camera, the \"shutter release\" is easy to press and it does have a built in image stabilizer.  But please understand that image stabilizers in cameras can do only so much, you still need to do your best to not shake the camera or the picture will still be blurry even with the stabilizer.  It was a little disappointing that I could not take what I thought should be a great picture.  While it could have been me, I am a semi-professional photographer and most of the time I know what I'm doing.Movie mode was similar.  The movie was good, not sharp.  You cannot zoom while in movie mode and the sound was actually pretty good.I want to conclude by saying this is an okay camera.  For Facebook, for emailing, soft pictures are fine, no one will even notice.

Lightweight and small, this is great for travel plus easy to use.  The pictures look really good and it is first-rate for the price.I admit it, I really don't read instructions much when I first get an item.  Which often results in mini disasters since I am so lazy.  But in this case working with the camera was so intuitive that I still haven't read the instructions on working the camera.  The only problem for me was getting the battery in.  In that case do read the instructions on inserting the battery because I could see how it could easily damage the camera if you tried to jam the battery in the wrong way.My favorite thing about this camera is how easy it is to use- just point and click.  There a ton of modes from different lighting (even fireworks, indoors, night), moving objects, close up, panoramic, cool black and white.  I particularly like the panoramic.  The camera has memory of the last picture you took and gives you an outline so you can line up the next shot and if it is still of it has an option to let you retake it to you satisfaction.  My other favorite mode is film grain which is in black and white and has a rough texture that made things look they were in a from a film noir.  I am also pleased with the lighting options and the modes to take action photos that do not blur the photos.  Another fab option is the timer which lets you take a pic 2 or 10 sec later so you can get in the photo, too.  The battery also seems to run for a long time. I have used it off and on for the past 4 days and not had to recharge it yet.  However, I have only been taking about 20 pics each time.However, there we a few things which I did not like about the camera.  The first being that it does not come with a memory card.  It instead has built in memory which amounts to like 12 photos!  And if you take a mini movie forget it, that is pretty much it of your memory.  So I had to go on Amazon an buy a memory card cause you want to take more than 12 photos!  I also bought a carrying case for the camera's extra protection. (another thing I am considering doing is getting an extra battery just in case)  The other thing is that the movie mode has a lot of limitations.  I liked that it also records sound but it is really more for fun since it still a bit primitive.  You can't make adjustments like zoom or change to black and white etc.  That last thing is the lock on the bottom for the memory card and battery is kind of flimsy and I could see where this might break if someone was a bit too forceful.Overall, great quality camera for the price, definitely pleased.UpdateThe camera fell in the sand and never recovered.
