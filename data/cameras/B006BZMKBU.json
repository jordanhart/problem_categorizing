{"Reviews": [{"Title": "First SLR!!", "Author": "Julie", "ReviewID": "R3F5FWP9Q2WH8U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first SLR and so far I love it.  I love the weight of it - extremely light.  At first it felt bulky compared to a point & click but I am getting used to it.  There's alot to learn now with lenses and settings that I have been searching for classes with no luck.  So for now, alot of trial and error shots - thank goodness it's digital. This kit has everything but the camera bag is way too small if you plan to carry all your lenses, filters, mini tripod, batteries, charger and book with the camera at all times.  The flip view screen is a feature I think I'll have on every camera now. Definitely recommend a T3i kit as it takes the guess work out of knowing what you'll need!!", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera and lens combo", "Author": "Scrapbamy", "ReviewID": "RJB23XVM60WS1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great package. We did a lot of research before we purchased and we are very pleased with what we received. The tripod is junk, but we suspected that beforehand.

Pictures and video are literally EXACTLY the same. This camera is half, or less than half the price of a 7D! There are some things that make this camera feel more comfortable for the family like auto settings. My wife loves those. It is lightweight, not the magnesium casing that the 7D has. The extra batteries that came with this package are fantastic. The tripod is crap but cool for the kids. Now, the macro/wide angle attachment is also pretty fun to play with. All in all, I have absolutely no regrets in purchasing this package!  Visit youtube and type in bookdeadsilence in the search box to see awesome videos of flowers and children playing, all shot with the T3i.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera and kit!", "Author": "Jenner85", "ReviewID": "R2HIOG2BJR6NYK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera and an awesome kit! If this is your first SLR purchase or your 5th, this kit really does include it all (or at least a very hefty portion of it).My one and only complaint about the kit is the camera bag itself. I can't even fit the camera and a lens in the case let alone anything else! Kind of disappointed that I now how to go out and buy another bag. But all in all, considering the cost and what comes with it, this is a great bundle and a great seller! Shipping was EXTREMELY quick. I ordered on a Monday (mid morning) and the package arrived Tuesday! It was amazing!Thank you!", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Best Camera ever", "Author": "Roger Kaput", "ReviewID": "R2AELJ1PT10HIB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best camera on the market. Way more features than most of us will ever use, but fun to experimemt with.  Great quality, great creativity is possible and very easy to use.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "First Time DSLR Buyer", "Author": "Voitek Klimczyk \"Lex\"", "ReviewID": "R3EHI7ZHNU37ZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm new to DSLR's and I purchased the Canon Rebel T3i because of it's 1080p video capabilities because I have a YouTube Channel where I post a lot of How-to Tutorials for Cars, Computers, and DIY Around The House Stuff.[...]Anyways, the Camera is amazing, although you will have to do a little bit of reading to figure out some of the more technical features. The good news is that you can set this thin on auto and you'll take excellent photos and excellent videos just like that. The more advanced features allow you to tweak your photos and videos, such as adjusting brightness, focus, blurring of background obkjects, and the speed of the shutter. I'm still very much a newbie with DSLR's but I have to admit that I fell in love with the camera and became a bit of a shutter bug as well. I think anyone that gets a camera like this will soon be filling up their hard drives before they know it. I actuall have to order a new hard drive as I'm writing this.Words of Advice:If you are looking for a camera that does photo and video very well = Get This!The only negative is that this camera doesn't do auto focus very well while in video, you have to hold the shutter button when you want to re-focus the camera on another object or scene. I also had some problems with noise in low lighting but, that's where the pro settings come in handy as well as the right lens. I seen videos on youtube with people making amazing quality movies with this exact camera, so I know it's just user error :PGreat camera and the kit has everything you need to really get started. If you bought a bare bones camera you would find yourself buying most of the items in the kit anyway. The items in the kit are all good, but the best items in it are the 2 real Canon lenses & the memory card. I have not really used the other lenses or filters. The Tripod is okay, but I believe if you spend the money on a really high quality tripod it would function much better than this one.Get the Camera; you will love it!", "Date": "April 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rebel T3i Digital Camera", "Author": "papa", "ReviewID": "RHKYWPOGSS4LY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We absolutly love this camera and use it all the time both for professional pictures for our buisness and for personal use.

The camera is a beauty which was as I expected but the tripod is way to small for a camera this heavy. The extra lenses are poor quality screw on lensesthat will not help the great canon lenses so those are money wasted. This is a over priced kit due to the quality of the added items all from China and should not be sold as components with a camera and lenses of this quality.

Plus I saved a bunch of money buying the bundle instead of purchasing the items separately. The camera itself is AMAZING. The additional batteries and chargers are wonderful and cost lots of $$$ if you purchase alone. I recently used the bigger tripod for the first time doing family photos for Christmas. All I can say is WOW. It made it so easy and I got professional pictures! Love it. Have not used the small tripod and I don't think I will.

It comes with every lens u cd possibly need and everything u cd use.  Just 2 problems.  One, if u r not familiar with fancy cameras, u need to get lessons.  Secondly, the camera and accessories DO NOT fit into carrying case.  You need to buy a backpack type case just for that purpose.  Also, be warned if u r using the small case that comes with it and decide to just take camera with u one day, it may very well fall out.  So beware.  But if u want to take up photography, this is the camera to get.  Taking my first pics with auto setting were gorgeous ..

I being using it for two weeks and I can say that I like it a lot. While the delivery the lens fluid spelt a little bit but it was well protected inside a Ziploc bag so it did not damage other items. I sent an email to the seller and he fixed the problem by sending me a new box in which contained the liquid and other accessories that were in side of the same box from the previous one.  By my experience shopping online other sellers when you tell them that you are not happy with what you got they just say they are sorry and won't fix your problem or you would have to call them a lot.
