The picture quality is good but nothing superior over other cameras.Here are some of the reasons why I rated it a 2:Menu:  the menu is not user-friendly, it has alot of sub-menus which makes it difficult to find the feature you want.Review:  when taking pictures, it would only preview the picture for 2 seconds and then revert to the camera screen.  I found this annoying because I would always have to click the review button and then go back to camera mode.  I couldn't find any way to set a longer preview time.Flash:  it would not remember my previous flash setting so half the time the flash would be off.Battery:  this was the most annoying part, you have to take out the battery from the camera and charge it in a separate battery charger.  also, the SD card was in the same compartment.  I will say that it did have a good battery life.Lens Error:  after using it sparingly for 6 months, I turned it on and got a Lens Error.  I sent it in to Casio because it was still under warranty and they send me a $135 repair estimate, which is more than I paid for the camera brand new.  Or they want $8 to ship it back unrepaired.I've had 2 Kodak cameras for years without problems.  Perhaps I'm having bad luck, but I won't be buying any Casio products in the future.", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome little camera", "Author": "Jack Senn \"Jack\"", "ReviewID": "R2TGW7LMIQMU4W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went shopping for a new camera after our Kodak EasyShare decided it didn't want to work any more.  I was comparing several models, but ended up choosing the Casio Exilim.  The shutter speed is fantastic in average to good lighting.  When shooting a 2 year old, this is crucial.  The features like \"best shot\" and \"make-up\" are awesome!  Make-up seemed to remove wrinkles and even blemishes on peoples faces when I was shooting photos.  Although the menu's take some time to learn (reading the owner's manual always helps...^cough cough^), the features it has are very good for a camera so cheap!  The videos, both audio and image, are good for a camera.  I would recommend this camera to anyone in the market that is not a professional photographer.  The Kodak I had prior seems like a dollar store item when compared to this camera!", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good camera for the money, but...........", "Author": "R. E. Gassert", "ReviewID": "R8S97PGPBFNLV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all, since you can get this camera for around $100 now, you have to say that is a good value at that price point.  It fits in a pocket, starts up quick, takes good video with sound, has a high speed mode and has a long lasting battery.  However........The lens quality leaves much to be desired, even for a pocket point and shoot.  This is where consumers have fallen into the megapixel trap.  Much like horsepower in a car means little to acceleration without torque, MP mean nothing without a good lens.  My old 4.1MP Fuji can take finer pictures than this.  So you won't be printing out any 16x20 prints from this camera.  But if your pictures never see photo paper, then this camera is great.It has a youtube mode which really speaks to the prescribed use of this camera.", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Save yourself money and buy a different camera", "Author": "A Nonymous", "ReviewID": "R3KPEZXUXJD7W4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hi, I'm a typical high-school student. I bought the Casio from Costco a little over a year ago, expecting a decent camera for my own use, specifically for a summer camp I was about to attend. My family already owns two Canon Powershots, which have 7.1 MP each.I thought the Casio would be an excellent buy, since it was (as I had thought) moderately priced at $[...], but I was soon dissapointed at the quality of its pictures. Casio claims to deliver a 8 MP photos, a claim I would say is arguable based on my experience with this camera. Every single shot I took appeared grainy and unclear, to the point at which I took out my family's old 7.1 MP Canon SD800 to compare side-to-side shots. I was stunned to find that the picture quality of the Casio was clearly worse than that of the Canon.The image stabilization of the camera is pretty much non-existent as well; the poor picture quality got even worse with the slightest hint of unsteadiness whilst taking a picture.The worst was yet to come. While I was on a vacation with my family in the Dominican Republic this last March, I tried to turn on the Exilim, only to discover that the lens had somehow managed to become jammed halfway out, which I have been trying to remedy for the last year to no avail. Further, part of the metal casing near the zoom-in/zoom-out dial had come loose with it, causing the dial to become to loose to use.After searching online for a replacement camera, I discovered that there were MANY other cameras on the market for a far less price-- I saw 10 MP cameras for as low as $[...]! Needless to say, I'm definitely buying another brand next time.(As I write, I'm planning to purchase a new Sony CyberShot to replace the Exilim. The Sony is 12.1 MP, AND costs $[...] less than the crappy Exilim! :-)", "Date": "August 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "PDB \"mrs goodstar\"", "ReviewID": "R149F7H0QNJZKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera was purchased as a gift for our daughter.

But it is not something happened in post, the silver model has scratches like shade.  I didn't like having this color...I should have opted for a color having smooth shade.Apart from, the camera seems good in battery life, photos quality.  I have two suggestions to make for the manufacturer1. Instead of taking out the battery, can we have the camera just plugged-in for a charge...like the way we do for cell phones2. The USB support, is not a standard USB ports for the camera.  The one that connects to computer is USB standard but the other end that connects to camera is NOT a USB standard.  So, if I lose the camera USB cable then I have to order from manufacturer than using any standard USB cable available.  Before of above two problems, I have problems in accepting the camera as \"good\" camera", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.99", "Features": "8mp with 3x zoom\nAuto shutter\nYou Tube ready\nInstant video button\nFace detection", "Name": "Casio Exilim EX-Z80SR 8MP 3x Zoom 2.6-Inch LCD Screen Digital Camera (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41c%2Be3al2gL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0012XXD7Q"}}
