Its a wonderful camera, and is more then enough for me, and the family, senior, weddings etc Ive been doing!This kit was the perfect price, I couldnt have found a better deal! I love everything in this kit. except 1 thing, its a minor thing cause it doesnt really affect me, but the Tri-Pod is Very Flimsy and when I went to put my camera on it, the tri-pod was broken, even if it wasnt broken I wouldnt trust putting my camera on there. Luckily I have a better durable tri-pod! :) Like I said nothing that affects me :)", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera and kit!", "Author": "linetta33 \"Linetta33\"", "ReviewID": "RDC0W055N1ATF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did my research and shopped around.  I looked at flyers and asked what other people thought of Canon.  For what is offered, it is the best price I could find.  Know the slight differences in Canon EOS Rebel T3 and T3i though.  T3i is slightly more expensive related to higher MP (18), a swivel screen, a sensor telling you when to clean your lense and other differences.  I have the T3 and am extremely content with it.  GREAT pictures and easy to use...I would recommend reading the book and experimenting.  It then becomes easier still.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "T3 Package Review", "Author": "Max Gatsche", "ReviewID": "R3DUD8FUFWYE2F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought one of these for my son and his wife for their wedding present.  After seeing it I bought one for my wife.  Everyone loves them.Camera is great, takes great pictures and has plenty of options that will help any photographer.  75-300mm lens is a pretty good starter zoom.  16GB SD card is plenty of memory for most people.  Camera bag is not a bad starter bag.  Tripod has a lot to be desired and is flimsy.  I would recommend you get another one if you plan on serious tripod usage.All in all, this is a great camera that you can grow with, at a great priceLastly the vendor sent the package right away without a hitch.I would highly recommend this package.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Features", "Author": "BG", "ReviewID": "R5CCG21T2RBXW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I took my time to review many DSLR cameras before making my choice with this EOS Rebel T3 camera by Canon.I would say this is above a beginner who is just starting out with an DSLR camera. I took 6 to 8 hours reading the manualand watch the DVD. No more auto mode for me. In the Program mode you can change settings on the fly and still havemany auto features retained. I plan to use this camera for closeups, portraits, and macro shots. I am the type of person who study's everything there is to know about a product before using it. I have taken some fantastic shots just playing with the various settings that this camera has to offer.  I am solidly convinced this is the camera for anyone who wants to go beyond Auto and get the enjoyment out this camera using the various settings in the program mode. WOW factor off the charts. Glad I read reviews first before making my final choice. The only negative would be that both of the lenses that came with this purchase are not UMC, but it is livable.Update:I have had this camera now for about three days and have played around with various settings and features. Definitely will keep in P mode for majority of the shots. After watching the instruction DVD that came with the camera, I was able to understand more and more why you should use the P mode, There you can access setting and features and make changes on the fly. Auto mode is not what I purchased this camera for. I knew that when I decided to buy this camera. I watched the DVD twice and with my camera next to me. I was able to follow along with the narrator and made same changes to took practice shots.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent package - camera, lenses and more - great value!", "Author": "Elinor Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3EBHKP6Z72JYQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A number of years ago when my husband and I had no kids and more disposable income we were both rather into slr photography, various film speeds, slides, black & white, effects filters etc.  We had a lot of fun with it but spent a lot of money on film and processing.As digital cameras took over the market we were still holding out for a reasonably prices Digital SLR (now that the majority of our \"disposable income\" was taken up feeding and housing our growing family).  As last year's Consumer Reports year book rated the Canon Rebel T3, T3i and T4 very similar in quality, price and value I figured it was time for the best birthday present ever for my husband.  Bonus was the lens mount on the T3 would take his old lenses from his traditional Rebel SLR.This kit was by far the best value for the camera, multiple lenses, bag, extra battery, tri-pod, cables and much more.  Over the past 7 months he has taken thousands of photographs (3 kids in 5 different sports - and throw in ballet & tap for good measure) and the photos keep getting better as he gains further skill with the camera.  Fast shutter speed, easy swap out of lenses, ability to set ISO and depth of field make it a wonderful choice.He got it for his birthday in December 2012 and as recently as last week commented \"did I thank you for this camera, I really love this camera, thanks again\".Highly recommend - but as others have said the tri-pod is flimsy and not really an asset to the package deal.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera, poor chinesse accesories.", "Author": "Laura", "ReviewID": "R1GF82IF2E0MMS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera is acceptable, but you might find same accesories cheaper somewhere else.

Mollere", "ReviewID": "R1EPGBTKY7BOCX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a Christmas gift for my wife. It worked fine the first 3 times we used it, then for one reason or another the camera would not recognize the SD card. At the same time I noticed the battery failed to hold a charge and completely drained a freshly charged battery overnight.  I contacted beach camera, and they sent me a new SD card.  This card worked fine, but the battery still failed to hold its charge.  Beach referred me to Canon warranty repair, as it was now 45 days past purchase date (even though it sat under the Christmas tree for 23 days).I sent the camera to Canon, with a note detailing the SD card problem which had been resolved, and the problem the batteries failing to hold a charge, which I thought might be related.  They returned the camera, stating that they had replaced an electrical part related to the SD card....and made no mention of the battery problem.  I returned the camera to Canon, asking them to check for problems related to the rapid battery drain.  I just received the camera, with a note advising me that they were unable to duplicate my problem, and the camera worked per their specifications.I bought this camera on the advice of two close family members that owned it, and highly recommended it. In mentioning my problem to them, they both stated that they battery remained charged for over a week as they took occasional pictures....as mine did for the first 3 weeks we owned it.So, while the Rebel T3 is a quality camera, don't depend on Canon to resolve your problem if you get a lemon.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Good Value!", "Author": "rmatraining \"rmatraining\"", "ReviewID": "R2GQDCJB39URJ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would have given a five rating except for a few things I will mention, but overall it is an excellent value.The picture sharpness on the 18-55 mm lens is excellent, and that is one of the main reasons I wanted to upgrade from a Canon point and shoot.  The second lens that comes with it (70-300 mm) is virtually useless without image stabilization unless you set up a tripod.  Speaking of tripods, the one you get with the kit is too lightweight to steady the 70-300 mm lens for a quality shot, so plan on buying a heavy-duty tripod if you want to use the lens.The camera on Auto takes great indoor pictures with flash, far better than anything I have owned in the past.  I have not been able to get a good picture with a subject under an incandescent bulb, and I have tried about all the settings I can find, but maybe I have yet to learn the secret.  Yes, I have put the camera on the incandescent setting.When you price the kit out separately, the extra you spend on the kit vs buying the camera separately is a phenomenal deal.  I cannot justify replacing the 70-300 lens with the image stabilizing equivalent ($699), but I will probably buy something in the 200 mm range that is stabilized.If you want to step up to a DSLR quality camera, you can't go wrong with this kit.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Camera - Bad Tripod - bad spare battery", "Author": "Div", "ReviewID": "RQSO7X6CNGSDJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros - Good camera.Cons -Bad Tripod.

Normand \"Scotcher\"", "ReviewID": "REHEEM8EVBPAZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is easy to get tunnel vision with all these glowing reviews on Amazon.  However, this camera really doesn't have any standout features.  Its the same old technology that has been around for years.  You are still going to have to wait a ton of time between shots, the burst mode is slow, and the burst mode does not support focusing between shots.  The view finder is not going to actually show you the picture you are going to get since it is an optical viewfinder.  And the viewfinder is going to black out when you actually take the shot.  Sure, all these traditional SLR cameras take great pictures, but really, what camera at this price doesn't.  What are you really looking for at this price point?  For me, it is fast between shots and can burst fast so I am sure to get a great shot.  I hate cameras that make me wait between shots until the camera is ready to take another picture.If you want the hidden gem in the SLR camera world, check out the Sony SLT technology.  It is a new technology that is much faster and allows the viewfinder and focus mechanisms to function like they should.  I have the SLT-A57 and I think you can tell from the reviews that it is as good or better than any of these SLR cameras.No, I don't work for Sony.  I just think that someone should point out the fact that there are other options out there and better technology available.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Irene", "ReviewID": "RI2CNGXDSSBSW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camara to take quality pictures at the boat races.

The tripod is pretty sucky as expected. Even when locked down, it still moves when the camera is attached. The SD card reader is also pretty sucky. The cap is extremely loose and sometimes when I upload picture or video, it will just shut off. Once it even deleted all the data. The camera bag is quite useful when it comes to storage. I like it and the battery as well. Just the other day, I accidentally left it in my pants pocket and ran it through the wash, when it was done and I saw the battery, I put it in a container of rice for a day, and it worked perfectly! The memory card wallet cheaply made and ripped within the first month of use. Last but not least, the cleaning kit. It might just be me but when ever i try to use the micro fiber clothe, it leaves smudges on the lens. Thats why I got a lens pen. Its super convenient!

Don't unscrew anything too much and it should be okay. The tripod is fine but I won't rely too heavily on it.Overall the camera is awesome, great picture quality and easy to use. The EF 75- 300mm lens is pretty awesome too and good for portraiture.

The main reason for me returning the T3 is that (unless I'm mistaken) there is no video playback on the camera itself so you can't playback without hooking it up to a T.V. or computer ( please correct me if I'm wrong about that point).If your looking for a low cost high quality camera get the T3 you'll love it. The T4i does have alot more features then the T3 however you pay for them as the T4i is usually more then double the price of the T3.So if you plan on purchasing the T3 I'm sure you'll love it as I stated before you can't go wrong with it and  was especially pleasantly ssusrprized at the awesome quality of pictures taken in low light without using or needing a flash. Also The T3 makes great black and white photo's and also allows you to shoot in Raw format as well as a few others, allowing you more ease at editing etc. Good luck", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "iubaby", "ReviewID": "R1B8P74AZMLJEC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera for the price,, the 300mm zoom lens is great at the kids sporting events.

The 18-55mm lens takes great general pictures and the telephoto brings most objects close enough for great pictures.

It also comes with printed instruction manuals for beginning photographers as well as CDs.  I am very happy with the set.

Now that the Digital Age has arrived, much of the learning costs have gone down.  You also get immediate results!  So, after shopping around various packages, I decided on this Canon EOS T3 Kit.The camera should be sufficient to teach me the basics of photography. If/when I master it, I can always purchase a new camera body, but this pckage should keep me busy for some time to come.My only concern in the entire package is the tripod.  It is a low-end model, not very fluid action and only one bubble level (I would prefer 2).  I would have gladly paid a little more to get a better quality tripod.Overall...if you're a newbie to photogrphy and don't want to front a huge amount of cash to learn, this is a pretty good package.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Canon Camera package deal :)", "Author": "Heather Stephens", "ReviewID": "R2TWQ951IJSKEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything that's advertise came as pictured.

I believe the package was well worth it especially because of the fact that there were two different lenses included along with a memory card, tripod etc...Considering the fact that I am a fashion blogger, I can say that this camera comes highly recommended because it takes great pictures of outfits with details portrayed very well.

It has been an excellent camera and it still takes fine pictures. However it's heavy, the flash attachment is no longer reliable and developing film is becoming a problem. Time to update. To me the only way to go was a new Canon SLR. Amazon had what I wanted and the price was right.I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box to find many more things in it than the camera. A tripod, an extra battery, as well as a camera bag were the top three.It is a more complex camera than the old one and while I am still learning how to use it (I guess that I'm use to a \"phd\" unit) I can see how much more this one can do as compared to the old one. I like the viewer and prefer using it over the screen. It takes some \"getting used to\" but I think it will well worth  the trouble of learning.", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "rebel t3 package", "Author": "DAVE DELUCA", "ReviewID": "R1EKIM6GZV1OIL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "awsome simple  to use and nice pictiure taken good quailty for the price .if there is one the camera case was poor quality .", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "ERIK PERELLI", "ReviewID": "R31Z7LAFNJ1XCD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice 35mm camera, great price!
