Gonzalez \"Vince\"", "ReviewID": "R39W9KIIXNNSD9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a serious photographer and I usually shoot with a pro Nikon camera.  I purchased this camera because I did not want to expose my pro Nikon to the elements, and this camera is wonderful for that purpose.I have added some sample shots for you to judge the quality for yourself.  I have to agree with other reviews that the GPS function is ok at best.  I have found that I need to be in clear view of the sky for the GPS to find the current location.  I have noticed that while the GPS is searching, it really uses lots of battery power.  I now geotag a few photos and then turn off the GPS to save on battery power.In strong light, the camera sensor washes out some images...  I would like to see a feature to allow for strong backlight as well.It is very easy to put your finger in front of the lens by mistake.If you use a Mac, the AVCHD (30 min recording at a time) mode does not play, I have to A) convert the file or B) set the camera to HD (10 min recording at a time) mode.I have dropped the camera from 5 feet or so into the sand where it was 75% buried, I found that I needed to rinse the camera off under running water to get all the sand out before I opened the door.  No damage or issues with this.I have operated the camera in 20 degree weather for hours with no issues.I have operated the camera in 90 degree weather for hours with no issues.I love that I can simply push a button to start and stop the recording process.If you have some basic knowledge of photography, you will be able to use all of the different available settings to your benefit.  If you simply want to point and shoot, keep the camera in the iA mode and this will work out fine for you.I really like the night shot mode because it allows me to hand hold the camera.Overall, I really think that this camera is a very good buy, given all that it can stand and the places I can take it without having to worry about it.  No the photos quality is not A+,  but I am also not exposing a camera that costs thousands of dollars to the elements.  I have in fact recommended this camera to other friends.  I am enjoying this camera and I think you may enjoy it as well...", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R13W7OJGHA48RD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has exceed my expectations in every way. I've had the opportunity to use in the rain, the sea and in a pool.  The image quality is far superior than I imaged, especially underwater.  The HD video is very good both above and below water.  The unit seems sturdy based on the abundant amount of metal use on the body. I wouldn't be worried if I drop it.Why did I buy this?  Well for one an upcoming Caribbean vacation, reviews and specifications. I plan to take video of Stingrays and turtles soon.  Originally I purchased a Pentax WG-1 which really had terrible HD video and image stabilization on land.  Admittedly, I am extremely picky about HD video quality (I do videos) and the Pentax just didn't cut it for me. So I returned it and obtained this unit. Glad I did.Photos and video taken with the Ts3 underwater are sharp + balanced.  The water tight seal seems adequate and did not fail after three hours in the pool and several excursions in the sea.  The pictures taken on land are very good and appear 85% as good as a DSLR (this will never replace a DSLR).  I enjoy using it and what appeals the most is that I can get it wet and not worry. I can accidentally drop it and not worry.  Plus I can slip this camera in my pocket- its portable.Things to know about this camera:1) Don't expect to record your cannonball jump into the pool.  The units water tight seals are not meant for impact in the water.  Don't put it into rushing water like a creek or massive wave.2) Sand- a sand grain got wedged into my shutter button and made the camera act as if it was attempting to focus all of the time (this made the other buttons on the camera useless).  The camera comes with a little brush and I used it to take the sand out. Works fine but the whole experience was not a fun time.  At least I've posted this for others.3) If used in the sea, remember to soak it in tap water when you are done per the instructions.  Then let it dry before opening. Don't rush it.4) follow the instructions on caring for the unit such as making sure the seals are clean before going in the water.5) Buy a CHUMS (float for the camera- search amazon) especially if you plan to use this in a pool. It came out of my pocket a few times and luckily I had a CHUM attached which allowed it to float instead of sinking.I really like this camera.Cheersupdate- Used this camera for 11 days in the Caymans and never had an issue. I made sure to allow the camera to dry before opening and closing the door. Also make sure to clean it each time with the little brush that comes with the package.  I think some folks may ignore this and that's why they have issues with water entering, etc.  I took about about 4000 pictures/video with this camera during my vacation.  I did notice when you got into dark situations the camera had issues with focusing but really what do you expect for a camera at this price?  It's a trooper in my opinion. Make sure to purchase the CHUMS flotation strap as that saved me from loosing my camera a couple time when it fell out of my pocket in the ocean.For an idea of what this camera is capable of here is a link to view..

I also bought an xp30 and the Panasonic consistently blows it away.GPS:  First sat aquisition takes a while, that is to be expected.  After than in clear view (no trees, etc) I have gotten quick consistent signals in Hawaii and decent signals in Washington.  Hawaii is much better as would be expected because there are more available sat's the closer to the equator.  If you are expecting performance on par with your Garmin device, you will be disappointed.  If you are expecting the tiny gps sensor to work under most reasonable circumstances, then you will be pleased.  The GPS data on the display screen is a nice bonus but again, don't fool yourself into expecting dedicated gps device performance.Underwater camera:  I've snorkeled in 75 degree salt water for four days in a row for not less than 3 hours.  In clear water the underwater pictures are amazing.  I never got anything close to this quality out of the XP10 and it is a good camera.  It completely blows the XP30 away.  The full 1080 movies underwater are also excellent, though to be fair I've only watched them on the 720 laptop screen.  The camera has gotten a rinse in fresh water after each ocean bath and plenty of time to air dry.  So far very good.  I can't say enough about how much better the images are from this device.Battery:  yet another custom sized battery and accompying charger.  I'm not going to pick on companies for having a custom sized battery too much, but for my sanity, please just make the darn camera charge over a standard usb plug.  I see how having a seperate charger coudl allow me to run with one and charge another but really, the battery life is very good (2-3 hours of actual snorkeling with the camera on all the time and still only using about 60% of the battery.Outdoor picture quality: Good.  lots and lots of specific modes (everything from portrait, to sunset, to fireworks, etc..) good enough general use that I left the canon SX100 at home but I do miss the 10x zoom.  I'm willing to trade off the zoom for the one device and the massive improvement in ruggedness.Haven't done much indoor shooting yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if this camera gives up a little bit in that side of things.  There are LOTS of good cameras for shooting indoors, but there aren't many that you can take snorkeling in the morning, drop on the gravel road loading up the car, and then rise and dunk into a snowbank in the evening.  This camera impresses me more every day of vacation.  I brought the xp10 as a backup but it hasn't even gotten out of the suitcase.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "DETAILED COMPARISON OF Panasonic TS3 to Sony TX10", "Author": "SammiMur", "ReviewID": "R2ZECGQZS7CYSD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, some background on what I was looking for:  I'm a casual photographer.  I wanted a waterproof camera which would produce high-quality photos in all settings (indoor, outdoor, and underwater.  My intention was to completely replace my 7.2MP Sony DSC-W7, which I LOVE.  I wanted to add the underwater feature without compromising on other features.  I did not want to spend more than about $400 for everything (camera, two 8GB memory cards (Class 10), two extra batteries with charger, and float strap.  This left me with about $340 max to spend on the camera itself.  I do NOT know a lot about photography.  Terms like \"ISO\" and \"white balance\" are foreign to me.  I like to use pre-programmed scene modes and auto features.  I enjoy digital scrapbooking and I frequently zoom and crop.  It takes a very high quality photo to crop out/enlarge a small figure without too much distortion.I began my search online and spent about 6 hours researching the cameras in my price range.  The cameras I focused on most were the Canon D10, Sony TX10, Panasonic TS3 (sometimes referred to as FT3), Olympus TG-810, Olympus Tough 8010, Fujifilm XP30, and Pentax WG-1.I eliminated most of these options rather quickly based on their reviews, overall ratings, and the quality of photos that I reviewed.  I narrowed my focus to the Canon D10, the Sony TX10, and the Panasonic TS3.I wanted to love the Canon D10, since it seems to be the overwhelming fan favorite, but I ultimately decided that it wasn't going to be a good fit for me.  The price of the D10 is similar to the Sony and the Panasonic, but it's a 2.5 year old model which doesn't have HD video.  The photo quality seemed about equivalent to the other two, so I decided to only focus on the two models with HD video.I would have been completely sold on the Sony, since I've used only Sony cameras most of my adult life and I've never been disappointed in one; however, there were some notable deficiencies which most reviewers found with this model (detailed below), so I was a bit hesitant to take the plunge.  The Sony was also priced near the top of my budget ($329), whereas the Panasonic was only $275 at Amazon.com.  The Panasonic reviews seemed to all be very positive, with the only significantly commonly-noted problem being lower quality indoor photos.  However, all of the indoor, outdoor, and underwater photos that I reviewed online looked very good.I decided to take a chance on the Panasonic TS3 and I really, really, wanted to fall in love with it.  I ordered it from Amazon and they delivered it the next day.  I wasn't blown away by this camera.  The outdoor photos were good.  The video was very good.  The underwater photos (taken in my large fish tank) were very good.  The indoor photos were POOR.  I decided to order the Sony TX10, hoping that I'd see better results.  I ordered it from Amazon at 9pm that night and it was delivered at 1:00pm the next day (gotta love Amazon!).  The photo quality of the Sony camera is outstanding.  I'll be keeping the Sony TX10!!!  For some people, however, the Panasonic might be the better choice.First, I'll provide my overall recommendations, then I'll add in all of the detail:BUY THE SONY TX10 IF:You value the quality of the photos/video above all else.You like touch screen devices.You don't plan to dive lower than 16 feet.You don't care if you can't adjust your settings (other than zoom) underwater.You want a VERY small camera.You always use a wrist strap.BUY THE PANASONIC TS3 IF:You can live with grainy indoor photos.You don't typically enlarge your photos to 100% (because they will be distorted).You want a camera with GPS.You plan to dive deeper than 16 feet.You want a larger (but not too big) camera.You're looking for a less expensive option.NOW FOR MY DETAILED COMMENTS ON BOTH MODELS:PRICE - The Sony is +/- $50 more expensive than the Panasonic.SIZE - The Sony is significantly smaller and lighter than the Panasonic.  I don't think one is better than the other, per se.  It's a matter of personal preference.  The Sony will fit in most pockets.  The Panasonic probably wouldn't.RUGGEDNESS - Both cameras are rated very well in this area.  I haven't \"tested\" them, but it seems like the Panasonic is built a bit tougher and would be less likely to get destroyed in a fall.  Rather than test this feature, I'm going to just trust the experts that either one will hold up well if dropped.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice rugged camera (with some caveats, see updates)", "Author": "MikeF", "ReviewID": "R37Q4L94QNNT6P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Had my TS3 for about a week and I have to say it looks snazzy in blue.  It has so many features that it is going to take a while to figure them all out.  Actually most of the features allow the camera to take better pictures in a wide variety of conditions automatically (iA modes).  It is definitely more rugged and ergonomic than the TS1 I lost :(.  You do have to be careful how you hold the camera on the left side as a finger could easily block the lens or cover the mic.I was very happy with my previous TS1 and I can already tell the TS3 it is as good or better in terms of picture quality. I have taken a series of indoor and outdoor shots, with and without flash, macro to full zoom, and overall the sharpness, color and light balance where very good.  So far I liked the \"intelligent\" features like iExposure, iISO and iZoom and decided to leave them on.  HD video looks great and the anti-shake works very well while walking with the camera.GPS, one of the main reasons I bought this camera, is a little tricky.  If you turn it on it stays on even when the camera is off so it can keep track of it's position, however I am not sure how the battery will last in this mode?  The manual says it will eventually shut off if the camera is not used for an extend amount of time (doesn't state how long that is) or if the battery become to low.  If you put it in the airplane mode, the GPS shuts off when you turn of the camera, which will conserve power, but it takes a few minutes to acquire when you turn the camera back on.  I am probably going to leave it in the airplane mode but will switch to ON if I plan to take pictures for an extend amount of time so it is ready to go and I am sure for that short of time the drain won't be an issue.  In any case it is good to have spare battery charged up in the camera case.Speaking of cases I also picked up a Lowepro Rezo 30 compact case which fits the TS3 perfectly, and is very well built with an extra pocket that holds pretty much everything I could want including the case strap, extra memory card, USB SD card reader stick, and extra battery very nicely.  Highly recommended and a great value.  Lastly picked up two Wintec 16GB SDHC Class 10 Flash memory cards.  I wanted 32 GB of memory to be able to record video and photos but didn't want to chance having one card in case it died so I bought two 16 GB cards.  I am not a fan of Transcend cards from my experience with them on my TS1, so I did some searching and saw all 5 star reviews on every site I found the Wintec card.  All I can say is these cards work great!  I had no problem recording HD video and they are very fast at pulling off data with my USB2 reader.  Add in a lifetime warranty and they are an amazing value!Update:  Be sure you update the camera to the latest firmware.  Mine came with V1.0 and Panasonic recently released V1.1 which I installed and it definitely helps GPS acquisition and location handling.Update 2:  I finally had a chance to use the camera underwater in the Philippines on a several snorkeling trips.  First trip was great, no problems, and got awesome pictures and video.  Two days later on another trip, water got in the camera and it would not power on.  Made sure seals were clean and rinsed it off with clean water afterwards, on each use.  If you look at all the 1 star reviews on this camera most are related to water leak problems, which is about 10% of the 300 reviews! Luckily Panasonic replaced it under warranty, but it took about a month to get.  Not wanting to get bit again, I also bought this Lewis N. Clark Waterproof Multi Purpose Pouch for double safety and found it to work great and it is a nice fit for this camera, highly recommended!  I also notice problems with the GPS recognizing many of my locations in the Philippines, including Puerto Princessa, which is one of the largest cities and only about half of my pictures were geo-tagged even though GPS was set to \"ON\" all the time.  If geo-tagging is important to you I highly recommend downloading Google's free photo editor \"Picasa\" which is great for viewing and editing geo-tag information.  I orginally rated it 4 stars but because of problems I've had with waterproofing and GPS I changed it to 3 stars.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Surpassed expectations", "Author": "Suze71 \"Suze\"", "ReviewID": "R2RR5TP9XH5Z30", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for our Hawaiian vacation and for use while snorkeling and hiking. The TS3 performed beautifully. I also own a Panasonic Lumix G-1, their first 4/3 format camera with interchangeable lenses and filters. This TS3 performed similarly, although in many respects it is more versatile while I sacrificed little in terms of picture quality in most circumstances.  I ended up using the TS3 more than the G1 due to weather, ease of carrying an even smaller camera + lenses, and the video capability. After a few days I usually only brought out the Lumix when I wanted a shot using a viewfinder, a shot with the ~400mm telephoto and/or the polarizing filter. The TS3 only records photos in JPG format - no RAW capability.The TS3 doesn't take the place of higher end camera but it is good for better-than-average amateur snapshots.After my initial tests in a swimming pool to get ready to take the camera into the ocean, I had to first overcome a lifetime of extreme care around water.  Panasonic provides a thorough set of directions for using in the water, and after care.The TS3's underwater photos I took while snorkeling are stunning. I used it to a depth of 6 feet, no more, although some of the subjects were in 15-20 feet. Conditions ranged from bright sun to mostly cloudy, during the morning, mid day and mid afternoon. The bright sunlight produced better underwater photos, as you might expect. As expected the photos have a blue cast underwater, as well as above, which is a Panasonic thing.  The underwater videos were very good.Even above-the-water photos in normal conditions were great too. The photos taken in extreme conditions (driving rain, fog, mist, light rain showers, wind, volcanic dust, volcanic steam, sand, bright mid-day sun, inside a dimly lit cave, in a tropical rainforest, on a boat) presented good colors with good exposures (in some cases minor adjustments were made as needed.)(I had no problem gripping the camera, or inadvertently blocking the lens, or the mic. (Can't figure that out at all as a criticism.  That isn't a design flaw, that is a user-flaw.)Prints (4 x 6) are sharp and bright.PROS:1) ease of use (I am familiar with Panasonic cameras. I think the menus are intuitive.)2) picture quality;3) sound quality on videos; (I recently made a video of red-tail hawk and the tweety birds sounding alarms. I have since been able to draw interest from the hawk, numerous song birds, and other birds, and my cats in the sounds when the video is replayed outdoors.)4) can zoom videos.5) Battery life while snorkeling with the GPS OFF was great - I often got a few hours.6) good view screenCONS:1) annoying and unstoppable reminders regarding use around water every time it starts up. (so, on start-up, touch the shutter button and you won't have to go thru the message.)2) Excepting typical underwater photos, colors sometimes tend toward the blue end which is also a Panasonic thing. Easily correctable.3) The only real criticism I have is that, as many reviewers on many sites have said, out-of-the-box the auto settings tend to overexpose all photos, but my G1 does the same thing.  The easiest remedy for this typical Panasonic flaw is to READ THE MANUAL and learn how to override the auto settings with custom settings. The top button on the menu control button actually helps with this problem.4) Battery life is dismal while using the GPS. It isn't real accurate either.  It is a throw-away feature.USE RECOMMENDATIONS:1) I am very happy with my purchase. It met my expectations, and in fact, surpassed them in many cases.2) I would not necessarily recommend this camera for someone who doesn't have some amateur photography experience, or is too disinterested or lazy to learn how to it.3) Before going on the trip of a lifetime and coming home disappointed cause you don't know what you are doing: READ THE MANUAL. TRY the camera while reading the manual. TAKE TEST SHOTS (in a pool, or even the bathtub) in sunlight, in shadows, indoors, in the rain or at night, and BRACKET the shots. See what you like and what you don't, then make the custom settings accordingly.4) For water use, get a strap that floats the camera if you lose your grip. The one I have is detachable and was not a problem while snorkeling.5) Buy an extra battery and keep it charged. With care you can change it out without going through the whole cleanup procedure, EXCEPT drain the camera on a paper towel for a short while until no more water drains. I only had to change the battery once for an extended snorkeling trip.6) If you really must use the GPS, turn it on for your first photo, establish your position, take a photo, then turn off the GPS. It isn't that accurate and drains the battery horribly.7) For most typical conditions, in order to fix the overexposure, I simply set the eV to -1/3This is a great little point-and-shoot camera.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sleeps with the fishes -- in other words, not waterproof", "Author": "C. C. Holland", "ReviewID": "R1Q3RU2RRDYKF3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So disappointed! Had high hopes for this baby, but four months after purchase it's proven that \"waterproof\" seems to have a time limit on it. It served me through one trip that included a few swimming pool excursions and a river kayak trip, but the bit the dust on trip #2.One dip in Hawaiian waters was apparently too much for the seal to handle, and within minutes of leaving the water, the display began to freak out as the lens fogged from the inside. I opened it to rescue the memory card and was unhappy, though at this point not surprised, to find the innards swimming in sea water.I had double-checked the closure before hitting the beach, so is definitely wasn't operator error. I'm leaving it open to dry out and hoping for the best -- but not holding my breath.The other features of this camera are pretty good. Solid picture quality, nice easy menu, wide range of settings, and one-touch video operations are nice assets. But based on the fact it failed dismally on the one feature I bought it for, I have to judge this camera a washout.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "AWESOME Rugged Camera!", "Author": "BlackOutBrian", "ReviewID": "R3GYDOFOZJ2A2X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my backpacking trip through Thailand, which I recently returned from.  I haven't purchased a digital camera in years as I've always assumed I'd end up breaking it.  I did a ton of research before settling on the Lumix TS3, mainly for the new models extra features, added toughness, and the consensus that it takes the best quality photos of all the \"tough\" cameras.11 days of backpacking through the heat of Thailand in the summer and 4 SCUBA dives later I can say this camera is awesome!  I was very, very surprised how quickly the camera turns on and off.  You hit the ON/OFF button and you can take a photo two or three seconds later.  Great for saving battery since you don't have to worry about missing anything.  Speaking of the battery, I think I only had to charge the camera three times.  If you're just taking pictures, you'll easily get two or three days worth of power.  I took a few long movies while SCUBA diving, and that drained the battery in after a few hours.  One of the most impressive features of the camera was the depth it can tolerate underwater.  I took the camera down with me on two dives, the first was to 12 meters (40 ft) which is the max depth the camera is guaranteed for.  The second dive I took it all the down to 16 meters (~53 ft) and it still worked great!  I was pretty nervous going down that far with it, and honestly I pushed it a bit further than I meant to.  After maybe 30 minutes or so at 16 meters the auto focus seemed to not be as responsive so I decreased my depth some and everything went back to normal.  Toughness wise I fortunately didn't have any bad drops, but it was in the pocket of my backpack which was thrown around constantly.  No issues there.The night handheld shot works great, no flash and no blurry pictures.  Also the one minute exposure captured some really cool night shots.  Some of the best pictures of my entire trip though were of a sunset over the Andaman Sea with the camera in sunset mode, really amazing pictures!  The geotagging worked really well too, even in doors most of my pictures have a decent tag.The one minor issue is that water does get stuck on the lens so you have to wipe or blow it off.  Not a major issue at all, sometimes you just have to retake a picture.  Certainly not something that bothered me much, I'm still 100% obsessed with the camera.

I got it at 12/14 last year and bring it with my Hawaii vacation in Chrismas holiday. Before using it under water, I have read carefully about the instrument and the reviews from AMAZON, so I know the preparation work before using it underwater, and the clean work after using it underwater is very importment. But still, after the 1st day using underwater, the flash did not work. after the 2nd day using underwater, the camera can not power on. So I decided to send it back to the Texas service center, and begin from here, the real nightmare begins!!!!  Before I send back my camera, I have a web chat from panasonic with some customer service guy, they ask me to send my camera together with my contact info back to the service center, and \"they will contact me\", I WAS STUPID ENOUGH THEN TO BELIEVE THIS! So I use FEDEX ( Thanks god I decided to use FEDEX, because the tracking info by FEDEX is my only proof now) to send it back, then they got it at 01/03. So I called the customer service center's phone number (the phone is very hard to call in, because they are always busy picking other costmer's phone), and the assistant kick me from one guy to another guy ( totally 4 different people), so each transfer I have to wait for a long time under someone speak to me , then I explain to him/her about my story, and during the last transfer, the communication was dropped! Then I have to call in again, finally I was told I should contact another department and gave me a new number. So I use this new number to call in, it seems now it's the corret department.  Here comes the new story. They checked my info, and said there is no record in their system, and ask me for the serial number of my model, of course I did not remember the serial number because no one ask me to write down before send it out to the service center. After a long waiting, they finally find it in the warehouse (thanks FEDEX again, otherwise I think they will say they never got my stuff), and promise to call me back for update. The next day, some one called me said my camera is under warranty and the technican is working on it and gave me the work order number. I thought I would not worry more because next time when I call in, I have this number for easy tracking my status.  So today 01/26 I called in again, gave them the work order, and they told me this work order is for someone else with a different model. and, there is STILL NO RECORD of my camera in their system. And after a 30 minutes conversation (plus waiting time), they said they will check the warehouse again using my FEDEX tracking number, and call me back....

Looked very hard at this camera, the Olympus Stylus Tough 8010, and Canon PowerShot D10. After looking at Amazon reviews and other website reviews, all three cameras had people complaining about color reproduction and indoor picture quality. However, all three cameras had good comments for underwater picture quality. This made the choice very difficult. I then visited a local professional camera shop to ask about the three cameras (they had all in stock) and they told me the lens quality on the Panasonic was superior than the other three.  That's what finally helped us make a decision.Issues:1. Only 1 battery and it seems to run out of power very quickly when the meter moves from 3 bars (full) to 2 bars. Battery must be removed to recharge and that means time to rinse and COMPLETELY dry before you open up the access door. Be careful and gently clean the door gasket per the instructions.2. Underwater it works great! Really good pictures while snorkeling (less than 15' underwater) with the flash manually set to fire, no matter what. Did not use the video yet. When you want to take an above water picture when the camera is wet, the picture is usually blurry because of the water on the lens. We have potentially great pictures of each other smiling and laughing, that are 'bad' because the lens was wet. :(  No easy way to wipe the lens properly while out in the middle of the water.Recommendations:1. Buy a floating wrist strap. Any of these cameras will sink to the bottom in a heartbeat. It may be lost forever or scratch the lens on the rocks / coral.2. But a very fast SDHC card, like the class 10. The faster the card, the faster the camera can record the picture and be ready to go again. Plus, it is necessary if you want to shoot video in full 1080. If price is an issue, go for the faster class 10 and smaller capacity card.3. Familiarize yourself with and use the different settings. To achieve the best underwater, beach, and indoor picture quality, use the camera setting for that condition.4.

Practice a bit with it to learn how it operates before setting it to the all important vacation photos.  Once you get the hang of it, the GPS will serve you well.  What there aren't reviews about is the camera's ruggedness - and rightfully so - who intentionally drops their camera to see if it breaks?Here's my real-world review on ruggedness from personal experience.We went on a family vacation for two weeks.  I used this camera almost exclusively despite having a high-end DSLR in my bag as well.  The results were great.  The last day of our vacation, with hundreds of recorded photos on the SD card, we went to a water park.  So many great pictures to be had going down water slides if you don't have to worry about the camera getting wet.  While walking from a water slide to our lunch spot I slipped and fell - down a flight of concrete stairs.  As I went down the camera went flying.  I slid down a dozen stairs with the camera tumbling after me the entire, painful, way.I should note that I'm 6'7\" so the camera did a high velocity drop from roughly that height - probably a bit more since I threw it up as I fell.After dealing with the immediate pain and getting my bearings, I gathered up the camera, still in one piece, and got to my feet.  My first concern was that our entire vacation would be lost.  And then of course that the camera would be broken and the remainder of the day would be photo-less.  After sitting down at a nearby table I found that the camera itself had indeed taken it's share of bumps as well.  Hardly a square inch of the casing was without a scuff.  The camera was however still entirely intact - including the screen.  I pushed the power button and the camera came on, though it warned me that the seal needed to be checked.  It's a typical warning after opening the SD/battery compartment, but I hadn't done that. My next thought then was that the waterproofness (is that a word?) was ruined.I opened the SD card compartment and the SD card was in the ejected position.  So when the camera came down, it hit hard enough to dislodge the SD card.  I pushed it back into place, and checked out the water seal.  It also seemed intact.  I closed the compartment, and fired up the camera.  All seemed in working order.  After swapping out the SD card for a second (just to be sure any additional water wouldn't kill my vacation photos) I put the camera back in the water to see if it was still waterproof.  No problems there either.  In fact, the camera continued to function flawlessly for the remainder of the day - including more slides, wave pools, and other water rides.In the end, while the camera looks like it has seen better days, it continues to work great and take great pictures.  All the sensors continue to work as well.  This is one rugged beast, sure to take just about any wear and tear you can dish out in the course of normal, and even above normal, use.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Seals need annual expensive replacement, poor warranty, terrible customer service", "Author": "apb", "ReviewID": "R1FGL0LAGXWIGM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It will cost you at least $60 a year to replace the seals, as required by the manual.The warranty on the sensor for labor is only 90 days.  their warranty can be downloaded from:[...]  They give you 6 months on the part, but what do you plan to do with a new sensor they send you?  You'll have to pay them $180 to install it.I was considering buying this camera until I read the manual, which states you must replace the waterproof seals every year.  After numerous phone calls to Panasonic's customer service in Kingston, Jamaica and Manila, Phillipines over overly compressed garbled phone links, speaking to utterly ignorant CSRs, I was directed to Panasonic's service center in Texas, where I spoke to an ignorant CSR who told me it would cost $180 to replace the seals because that is what every repair costs.  After asking her again about a dozen times for about 20 minutes, she went to check with someone and determined that replacing those seals allegedly costs $45 + parts + shipping.  After even more asking again and again, she was not able to come up with the cost of the part.  However, shipping runs $12 to $30.  If you're lucky, maybe it will only be $12, but don't bet on it.  And shipping it to them is your problem.  No way to know how much they will gouge you on the part.  I wouldn't expect it to be cheap, though.If you buy this item you should assume that you can only use it in water for 1 year, or else assume it will cost you at least $60/year for the pleasure of owning a waterproof camera.(I note that Sony also states you must replace the seals every year on their tx10 \"waterproof\" camera.

So I'll give a breakdown.What I expected:I'm not a DSLR user, and the only good quality camera I've had before is the Olympus 1030SW, a water proof, so I'm used to reduced picture quality for the sake of robustness.  I know that I could easily get a camera that takes better pictures for half the price, but I spend alot of time outdoors and in water settings; so waterproof camera's are a must for me.Picture Quality:The pictures I got from this camera are far better than my old 1030SW.  The anti-blur and motion stabilization work great.  I tend to take quick one handed shots, and I never had a blurry picture.  All the outdoor shots are great, even those taken from a moving car or of moving objects.  The down side is indoor shots can tend to be fuzzy, too dark, or over flashed if you are using the auto mode.  I found the party mode makes these alot better, but let's face it you are getting an outdoor camera so outdoor shots are just better.Features:Good:The different scene modes are easy to switch to and from, though I mainly stuck with iAuto.  The camera is really fast startup and between shots.  Combined with the burst mode you can get all the action.  Face tracking is good, but doesn't work when the subject reaches a certain distance; such as taking a landscape shot with a person in it.  Battery life is also good, I took about 300 pictures a day, half with flash, and never went below the halfway point on the battery (though I did have GPS turned off).Meh:I had no interest in the GPS and only tried to turn it on once at the airport.  It took too long to connect so I just left it off after that.  I don't have a 3D TV so I don't care about the 3D pictures.  The face recognition, where you register a face and it names the person and gives the age, is cool; but it only worked selectively when the person was close.  Plus it briefly confused my face with my girlfriend (I'm white and she's asian so yeah).  Panorama pitures have to be done with the computer; I took one and it came out good, but there are other cameras that can stitch it together in camera.  You basically have no idea when taking it if you lined them up right.Bad:Poorer indoor quality, but it's still good for viewing on the computer.Toughness:I haven't tried the water yet but I'll let you know.  I'll assume that since it's good to 40ft it should be good for just about anything I do.Overall I like this camera, yeah it's a little pricey but it does what I expected it too, take good pictures and handle a beating.  If you are expecting the same as me (and can afford it) then I'd get it, otherwise look for something else.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad image quality, outrageously bad tech support", "Author": "D.

First, Panasonic sent me a work order receipt that listed the wrong problem. Then, Panasonic sent me a refurbished replacement unit THAT ALSO HAS SOMETHING RATTLING AROUND LOOSE IN THE CASE. Why yes, that is the exact same reason I sent my camera in this particular time. So they managed to find another unit with the same problem to replace my old unit.*****This camera has now been repaired twice. The first repair took a month and the new lens unit did not seem to correct the image quality issue. The second repair seems to have been more successful, although, in typical Panasonic tech support fashion, when they sent it back to me they included a rubber case--for an entirely different camera--with no explanation.**I wish I had held out for the waterproof Nikon.The image quality on the TS3 leaves A LOT to be desired - mushy details, way overblown highlights, deep shadows even in good lighting. My camera seems to treat every situation as low light, and unfortunately it really and truly sucks at handling low light.I do have to admit, though, that it has performed admirably underwater, in simple terms of not flooding, thus far. The last time I brought it snorkeling I spent an hour photographing sea lions, and it handled that with no difficulty. (When I sent it in for subsequent repairs, they did feel the need to replace the waterproofing kit.)Given the awards, reviews, high praise, etc. and after extensive testing to try to find lighting in which this camera actually captures a decent picture, I think I have a lemon. Unfortunately, I'm beyond the Amazon and Panasonic return period, which means I'm stuck with it, despite my best efforts. Although the Panasonic tech agreed that my experience seemed unusual, he refused to agree that it was a lemon, and I have been assured that I absolutely, positively will never see my money back.This is where bad tech support meets bad image quality. I have spoken with Panasonic several times, and each time I have been told to manually adjust ISO, exposure, etc...which is a completely absurd suggestion for a point-and-shoot I bought to take snorkeling. I would consider this an appropriate fix if and only if the camera came with the magical power to make fish hold a pose while I futz with the settings. (Intelligent auto on this thing REALLY stretches the definition of the word \"intelligent.\")In short, count me as a distinctly dissatisfied Panasonic customer. I'll stick with Nikon or Canon from here on out, but sadly I can't take my SLR snorkeling.

My previous camera was a pentax optio w10 (also a waterproof camera) that I was satisfied with for several years. I wasn't sure how much of an improvement this camera would be, but it is definitely a huge upgrade. I know it is not the perfect camera for everyone, but it fits my lifestyle perfectly.So far I have been able to use this camera to take tons of pictures and videos from my honeymoon to the Dominican Republic. I took it snorkeling, in the pool, hiking through the jungle, and jumping off of waterfalls. The only time that it struggled to take amazing pictures was while we were swimming through the narrow passageways between waterfalls where it was dark and wet. Like most any other camera, it struggled to focus on the subject and took awhile to snap the picture (it also didn't help that I was wading in the water and shivering from the cold water). Besides that, it has taken wonderful pictures that I was pretty satisfied with and only did minor touch ups on the computer.Pros:- 4.6x zoom is a big improvement over my previous camera's 3x (wide angle pictures are also nice)- very quick response time from being off to focusing and taking a picture- clutz proof (I knocked it on a lot of rocks climbing up the waterfalls and haven't noticed even a single scratch)- dedicated video button makes it easy to switch between pictures and video- intelligent auto mode is pretty good most of the time (I leave it on this setting unless I have a few seconds before I need to take the picture in which case I will switch to the mode that best fits the situation)- burst mode works well for action pictures or even to compensate for the constant blinker (even works with the flash)Cons:- size. it is much bigger than I thought it would be, but it feels great now that I have gotten used to it.- video button sometimes needs to be pressed twice to start recording. i have missed out on a few good memories because sometimes one button press will start videoing and sometimes it needs two (the first will just switch it to the video mode)...- LED light drains the battery, especially while videoing- like any other compact camera, the audio on videos is always muffled. also the microphone is where I normally hold the camera, so I have caught myself muffling the audio even worse many times- GPS feature is cool, but I won't really be using it as it is just more of a battery waster- because it is waterproof, you don't worry that it gets wet, but you also don't really notice that the drops of water on the lens are there and mess up your picturesI am very satisfied with this camera and would definitely buy it again.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "4.5 Stars", "Author": "A.

I probs would go with the red if I could do it again.\\It uses a lot of plastic. I know that cuts down on weight (I forgot it was in my pocket) and probably helps with insulation, but I'd feel better if it was metal.\\Stupid underwater warning reminding you to batten down the hatches everytime you turn it on. If you hit the shutter button it does immediately go away, but I accidently took a few pictures trying to get it to go so i could set up a shot.\\More features than I will ever realistically use.Cons-Indoor shooting is subpar, but avg for a P&S;, probs because of the sensor size and weak sauce flash. Had i manually adjusted the ISO settings it would have improved a bit I'm sure. But I really didnt get this camera for much indoor use.-They should make some of the buttons bigger and with more of a tactile feel for use with gloves. I did take some shots ok with my gloves on, but it was a challenge to work the focusing to shoot part. I realize most people dont use cameras with giant ski gloves, but thats the demo your targeting Panny! I can use all my switches on my FJ Cruiser with ski gloves :]-The lens is a little too high, again no doubt because of my gloves, my finger ended up blocking a few shots. They should find a way to drop it lower or differentiate the feel from the rest of the camera so I know not to stick my big fingers in front of it.I will be snorkeling in Mexico a few months, I'm interested to see how it will do underwater picture quality wise, since disposable come out soooo terrible. I'm assuming it will survive my upcoming trips to Joshua Tree and the sand dunes of Pismo Beach without fail.

Camera takes very good photos in GOOD to DECENT lighting. In low-light or indoor photos the quality degrades very quickly. Don't use an ISO setting higher then 400 or use ISO 800 but plan on fixing the noise levels in software.2. The 1080p video is beautiful and excellent in again GOOD to DECENT lighting. It far exceeds my Pentax K-x in daylight and only loses in low-light conditions.3. There are two video modes, AVCHD must be used to get 1080p video and to use the optical image stabilization. These videos can be open on a PC or a MAC by downloading the free open source VLC Player. Many people use this to play any kind of video you may have. iPhoto and Aperture 3 don't recognize AVCHD video format yet.4. I've used the camera underwater and the pictures are good and haven't had any issues with malfunctions. It also contains a LED light that can be turned on in low-light areas just like a Move Camera might have which is very useful underwater or again, when indoors.5. The build of the camera is sturdy and feels solid.6. It has many features, all which may or may not be useful to you but are nice to have.7. The GPS data can be set to store your Latitude and Longitude as well as CITY, TOWN, Etc...8. You can set the GPS to airplane mode which will only turn it on when the camera is on, thus saving battery life.9. The battery lasts a good while and you can easily get 300-400 photos off a charge.

I spent a year, and was always dissapointed with the 1-2 star ratings telling of repeatedly failing water seals. Olympus, sony, pentax, panasonic, canon, they ALL failed to some extent. So, rather than buying a camera I thought would never fail, I went for the one with the best reviews, and LEAST bad reviews. Olympus and sony had just as many 1-star reviews as they did 5-star. THATS OBSURD! panasonic seems to build a quality camera they are proud to back as oppossed to the many ongoing lawsuits with olympus and canon cameras. Among buying the best product, I believe a reliable accident included extended warranty is a MUST for purchases over a few hundred dollars. Manufacturer's warranties rarely cover accidents, and in the case of water leaking, its always YOUR fault, not a malfunction of the camera. SO, get a good warranty. SquareTrade is who I went with, and they do offer a 3-yr coverage with ADH (accident included) for a reasonable price and with shipping to and from included in as little as 5 days!Now to the camera, I have only had it for a week, and will repost if anything changes, but so far I think the camera is GREAT! i have taken many pictures, explored the different features and can say that it feels and acts like a reliable sturdy camera.

I could take the camera out of the ocean, and immediately get great pictures on the beach!My major complaint about operating the camera concerns the zoom buttons. They are a bit hard to push, and the camera often zooms more or less than you want. It would have been nicer to have a rocker lever like in most digicams. I'm guessing the buttons were needed to make the camera waterproof.I am using the camera with a Mac, so I didn't try any of the included software, all of which is Windows-only. None of it is needed with a Mac. Just plug the camera into a Mac, and photo or video apps such as iPhoto and iMovie will find the camera and offer to import the data.This was my first camera with a built-in GPS, and most of my issues with the camera involve the GPS. If you don't care about GPS, just turn it off and you can ignore these comments:1. When the camera is moved to another position, the GPS doesn't always lock in to that position. You have to check the GPS icon on the display (which is not visible in all display modes) to see if you got a lock. If you miss it, the camera happily records its previous position. It would have been nice to get a positive indication of lock failure.2. You must set your timezone for the auto-clock-set to work correctly. Why can't the camera figure out the timezone from the GPS coordinates?3. You can't change the travel mode's destination time zone when auto-clock-set is turned on.4. The altitude sensor uses barometric pressure and is not very accurate. It thought my house on a hill was 100 feet under water! Why can't it use the GPS to determine altitude?5. When the \"My Landmarks\" feature is used, the camera records the landmark, but stops recording city, state, county, and country. The landmark you set takes precedence over other nearby landmarks in the camera's database, so if you are in a city with many closely-spaced landmarks, you may get the wrong landmark recorded.6. The city/county/state/country info is stored in proprietary Panasonic EXIF fields in the JPEG. It will not be visible in applications such as Photoshop. I was able to write a script using \"exiftool\" (use Google to find it) to copy the Panasonic data to the standard IPTC and XMP location fields of the JPEG files.Some of these issues sound like bugs to me, but I was using the latest firmware version 1.1.

There has to be something in salt water (salt haha) that compromises the sealing on these cameras. It seems that everyone that has problems had the cameras leak in salt water. I seriously doubt it's the door leaking .. more likely seals around the buttons or the lens bezil or microphone. Good luck, and don't even think of trying to use the Panasonic warranty. It will only frustrate you. And there's no fixing the Panasonic warranty dept .. they will always suck.I had read a few similar posts to this one when I was shopping and I blew them off, to my regret. It's easy to say to yourself, \"well maybe they didn't know what they were doing, or maybe they were careless\". However I own, use and know expensive camera equipment quite well and I know I couldn't have been more gentle or careful with the camera and following all instructions. I did everything to the letter.So now it's your turn to read \"my\" warning. Will you heed it?BTW the TS3 and TS4 are the same except for some software programming, etc. The seals and body are the same.Update on 6/22/12 .. I got the camera back from Panasonic, not repaired or replaced. As promised in the comments section I did tear the unit down and here is what I found .. it seems as though the speaker leaks.Right behind the speaker hole is a connector and cables for the LCD screen. There were also a few spots that had minor leakage and corrosion but it had not made it's way into the internal unit. The leak from the speaker hole is different and seems to be, in my case, where this unit leaks and creates the so many black screens you read about in these reviews. The rough surface of the case might make it difficult to seal up the speaker hole with some industrial type tape, but that's what I would try if I already had one of these units and was going to submerge it. Of course, if you haven't bought one of these units the right thing to do is buy something else.The main cable to the LCD is very corroded at one point close to the connector end. My guess is that was the \"kill point\". I guess these ribbon cables are not waterproof or resistant. BTW, you need a really good Japanese type screwdriver ($20), a repair manual ($20, not electronic), and be aware that the two external screws on the lens side of the front of the camera are just for decoration .. do not try to remove them. With those tools and some patience find your way in. I'm undecided as to whether I should order a new screen (this camera still takes pics) .. that'll be a hundred bucks itself.Update on 6/26/12 .. Just so everyone knows, the \"packing kit\" that needs yearly replacement consists of about 8 seals requires a complete teardown of the unit .. not something that a normal user can do by a longshot. If you were to make the terrible decision to buy this camera figure on sending it in for service. Some seals are deep in the heart of the camera. It's not just the seal on the battery door, which is what everyone has been assuming.Better to buy something else (the new model Olympus seems quite nice and they have a very good history in underwater cameras) or if you already have this unit, buy the waterproof case at about $250. Then you don't need to replace the seals.", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best vacation camera ever", "Author": "Xmeromotu \"Xmeromotu\"", "ReviewID": "R703AVW1OTQXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera rocks. I had the TS2, which has apparently gone missing, so after much fruitless searching for the TS2, I got this one.  I wasn't really sure how much of an improvement it would be, but really, I didn't need too much improving. The best thing about the camera is that you can take it anywhere without worry about it. I took the TS2 to the beach in Mexico, on a cruise, to the pool, and it was wonderful. It takes great photos - don't let these self-proclaimed \"experts\" fool you with all this pseudo-technobabble. Yes, it would be wonderful to have a giant sensor, but then the camera would be too big to be convenient, so it would be sitting on the shelf at home instead of being useful.You can take awesome underwater photos of your kids AND you can record videos of them splashing about in the surf. Not many cameras you can do that with!!! The other reviewer who hadn't even tried it underwater ... well, I don't know why he/she even bought the camera. Of course it's not a SCUBA-diving camera, because there is no such thing. I have taken plenty of SCUBA trips to foreign countries and taken plenty of video 100-150' deep. What you do there is that you take the best camera, video or still, that you can afford, then you spend 1.5 to 2 times the cost of the camera on a housing that will withstand the pressure at 5 or 10 times the pressure at sea level. There is nothing magic or special about \"dive\" camera. If you want a housing for this camera, you can buy one - and after you've spent $5,000 on SCUBA equipment and learning to dive, it will be a good investment. But I promise, it will always cost you 1.5 to 2 times the cost of the camera to buy a housing for it. This camera is wonderful because you don't NEED a housing. I am not going to exceed 40' free-diving with this thing. If I'm free-diving, it'll be because I want to shoot fish with a speargun, not with a camera.This camera was designed to take on vacation, and you can put a big enough memory card in here that you won't have to take your laptop along to offload the photos and video.

Whether or not this is in the warranty fine print, this is not a reasonable user scenario. In the past, on the other hand, I owned a Canon waterproof digicam.

Sansom \"huw_the_book\"", "ReviewID": "R1JQ2I9RYIT800", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "[Updated at bottom]I have used some 20 or 30 cameras over the past 15 years -- point and shoots like this, video cameras, film cameras and film and digital SLRs. The Panasonic Lumix is a very nice point and shoot, but there are definite issues.... I have _not_ tested it underwater as of this writing (May 16, 2011).Pluses:1. Outstanding exposure balance. High-contrast shots will be well-balanced between light and dark areas. You will see detail in the shadows and in the highlights. This is a significant strength.2. Nice and sharp for a camera with a point-and-shoot sized sensor but a high resolution (12 megapixels).3. Excellent color balance. Images are not over-saturated, something I've seen frequently. The camera does give you a good deal of control over color.4. There is comparatively little barrel distortion when close to subjects.Cons:1. You do not get as much control over shooting as you do with comparable Canon point-and-shoots. Canon allows you more control over what happens when -- like the flash firing. With the Lumix, the Flash is either on or off. The camera tends to use the Flash when it is not really necessary.2. Accurate and rapid focusing is poor. If you hope to catch something quickly, forget about it. My camera sometimes doesn't get _anything_ in focus.3. As with most point-and-shoots, the aperture is small, so if you want to get a nice sense of depth, you will be disappointed.4. The macro feature is especially frustrating. For some reason, it sometimes fails to turn on. The focusing issues are worse with the macro feature.5. Some features remain on or off after restarting the camera, others don't. If you turned off the flash, that will remain off when you turn the camera off and back on. If you turned on the macro feature, that will turn off when you turn the camera off.6. Adjustment of some features -- like how the camera selects focusing area -- are annoyingly difficult to access7. The video compression format is MTS (MPEG-2 Transport Stream) is used. This format is used only by Sony and Panasonic, as I understand it. It will require an MTS converter.8. The Panasonic-provided software is Windows-only. (Come on guys, haven't you learned anything post-iPhone and iPad?)9. As I said, I have not tested the underwater qualities, but the seal around the door and the locking feature both look pretty feeble. I have used underwater housings professionally, and I can say that underwater is _very_ susceptible to user-error. A tiny bit of dust or a strand of hair in the seal can kill the underwater protection. Water wants to get in... and the deeper you go, the greater the pressure to force water in.10. And of course, this is a _very_ expensive point-and-shoot in today's market.Update (3 JUne 2011):I have had more time to work with the focusing issues on this camera, and my conclusion is that it is _terrible_ on focus -- slow and inaccurate. I rarely use point-and-shoot cameras. Most of the cameras I have used have been Canon (both professional DSLRs and point-and-shoots) and this is hands-down the worst camera I have yet seen for focusing. No matter how I adjust the settings (sports, facial recognition, landscape, portrait, etc.), it routinely fails to focus on the subject of interest.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Leaked on first use", "Author": "Joshua B.

My advice would be to try finding a deep pool and go swimming with it.  I did the bathroom sink test with no problems, but did not have the time to find a pool.  The camera leaked on the very first time out snorkeling.  Luckily, we brought along a second, non-waterproof camera as a backup to use during the rest of our trip.  For those who will attribute my problem to operator error, I assure you that I followed the directions religiously and used the included brush to clean the rubber seal of any hair/sand before closing it and locking the door. In fact, that was only the third time opening and closing the camera door since taking it out of the box.  This makes it highly unlikely that sand/hair could have caused the problem.

These videos play full screen on my 24\" monitor with great clarity - they are of course reduced definition for the web.We were going on a cruise to the caribbean last spring and I wanted a camera I could take with me snorkeling. Beyond that though, I wanted a camera I didn't have to WORRY about constantly.  I own a Canon EOS Rebel T2i 18 MP CMOS APS-C Digital SLR Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD (Body Only) and a Canon PowerShot SD1400IS 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Pink), both of which I love, but the DSLR is just too bulky and too expensive to take to the beach or on a boat, and even taking the small SD1400IS would mean constant vigilance to make sure it didn't get wrecked.  After seeing someone at a waterpark using a waterproof camera, I knew I wanted one for our cruise.I wanted a waterproof camera, but I did not want to sacrifice picture quality to get it. The quality didn't need to be perfect, but what was the point if the pictures came out crappy? I bought 3 cameras to compare them: This one obviously, the Pentax Optio WG-1 Adventure Series 14 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 5x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom (Black) and the Olympus Stylus Tough 6020 14MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD (Green).  I took some pictures and videos with each.  I didn't attempt to submerge them as I was planning to return the two I didn't like).I found that the Lumix took the best pictures and video of the three. I was really disappointed by the quality of the images that came from the other two.  They really just weren't up to par - many came out unfocused and the video was low quality. The Panasonic if I remember correctly had a seriously horrible lag time when taking pictures as well. The Lumix was however the biggest one of the bunch, its just a bit bigger than most digital cameras now a days, but not terribly so.  The Pentax had a great strap at the end and a clip, which I liked a lot, but I just wasn't willing to sacrifice picture quality for form factor.  The Pentax also had some kind of macro mode, which I honestly couldn't figure out what on earth I would use it for.Another thing I liked about the Lumix was the way they seal the camera - there is a door on the side which opens and has a switch to lock that conceals everything - the sdcard, the battery and the usb connection.  The other cameras had multiple openings for these things and relied on little rubber things to keep the water out.  So I chose the lumix and I have not regretted it!So far this camera has been snorkeling (and I dive down 15 feet while snorkeling), its been to the beach many times, and its been to water parks where we took it down the slides and took videos of ourselves in the wave pool. I love that I can leave it around my wrist or in my pocket and not have to worry about my camera being left by the towels in a public place - or not get any pictures at all.I have had no problem with the camera at all, and the pictures it takes are fabulous. Using a waterproof camera IS a bit more work though.  You cannot simply hop out of the water pop it open and throw in another battery.  I don't open the camera until its been allowed to air dry for a few hours after being toweled dry.  I follow the directions and carefully check the seal on the camera and use the provided brush to remove any sand or debris from the seal area. When snorkeling I put the cameras leash tightly around my wrist and do not take it off.  You also have to be careful about the temperature of the camera - if you leave it out in the hot sun, then plunge into the pool with it - the inside of the lens will fog up, this is not a problem with the camera, if you leave it somewhere to dry out it works fine again.  The manual warns against this problem - its not something they can prevent, its chemistry.  Try to keep the camera from getting too hot, don't leave it in direct sunlight.  Also, when you are using the camera in and out of the water the lens will have water droplets on it, which can obscure your picture.  It can be annoying to get them off especially if you are completely wet yourself.  I've taken to blowing hard on it, though sometimes that can fog it up temporarily.  I'm considering seeing if a big of shammy attached to the strap might be a useful tool for this problem.Another thing to beware is since this camera is more rugged you start treating it more ruggedly - and leaving it around the cement pool deck to get kicked around will result in scratches to the LCD screen, etc - I invested in a screen protector.  I also bought a float strap Olympus STRAP FLOAT ORANGE but DO NOT think you can use this out in open water where the camera cannot be retrieved it if sinks.  The float strap is a great addition if you are using the camera in the pool and the kids want to play with it.  The camera is shock proof but I don't want to test it by dropping it on the bottom of the pool repeatedly.In conclusion - if this camera was just a slight bit smaller, I would make it my everyday regular 'purse' camera, the picture quality is that good.  I love having a camera that I can take with me and not worry about the elements, if its raining or we are at the beach. And this camera has performed well underwater on numerous occasions.

I went on a trip to Great Wolf Lodge.  I had the camera in the hot tub for less than 30 seconds a couple times and was wondering what would happen.  It was working fine.  Then I went to the wave pool while the camera still felt warm and I noticed the screen started acting up and went blank.  (I used the camera in the wave pool for several days before with no problems)I took it back to the room and found a lot of water inside.  I shook all the water out and let it dry overnight.  It came back on the next day, but still had a foggy residue inside the LCD screen.  I left the battery compartment open for a few more days and the camera was back to perfect.Lesson learned for people who had leakage problems from other reviews.  Do not leave it in the hot sun or beach then suddenly submerge in cold water.  The thin rubber will warp.  I wish they made the lining thicker with more resistance to close the door shut for a tighter enclosure.Note:  I have used this several times at waterparks were I kept it in the lazy river for hours underwater with no problems.  It's now 6 months later and the camera is still working great.Update:  It's been over a year of use and I noticed the raised part of the seal is squished and leaning toward one side.  The seal does not look firm anymore.It was leaking on my last water trip and the camera stopped working.  I had to shake the water out and let it dry for a couple of days.

The buttons and menu system on this camera are simple to navigate, well laid out, and the camera gives you detailed information about each option on the screen.  Low-light performance is in the top of the class, and the aperture is a bit larger than the Olympus.  It is FAST to shoot a picture when you fire it up, so you don't lose any special moments.  Battery life is a bit less than I'd like, mostly because the GPS is trying to update itself frequently.

Battery life got much better after the second recharge cycle, and now after a weekend of shooting around 150 pictures, the battery icon is still on full.  The ability to go from off to shooting instantly has been valuable.  Ergonomics are good and it's easy to use in most any position.

I'm normally a Canon fan, but the only rugged/waterproof offering in Canon's line is rather bulky and isn't capable of shooting HD video.  Therefore, after reading many reviews on various sites, I decided to give the TS3 a try.I've only had the camera for about a week, but during that time I've used it while hiking and whitewater rafting.  For the most part, I've been impressed with the camera's durability--it didn't leak even when it went into the river with me--and picture quality.  However, I found that due to the position of the lens (in the upper corner of the camera), there are several pictures (particularly those taken while rafting) which are partially obscured by my finger (a problem I've never had with any of my other cameras).  I'm sure this is because I used to the lens being in the center of the camera, but I found that I could avoid this by simply gripping the camera firmly with my right hand as there's not much on that side to obscure.  In that position, I don't even need to use my left hand to steady the camera.One feature that I find particularly handy, is that photo and video capture are controlled by two separate buttons.  This means that you can switch between the two without changing any settings.  This was particularly handy while rafting when it would have been inconvenient and difficult to change settings between shots (and raging rapids).Overall, I'd recommend this camera.

The camera worked well (all functions), took great video and good quality still pictures.

Today, I received a phone call from the Panasonic Exchange Center requesting $180.00 to repair the camera.

Again, it worked great OUT of water, and even for a bit in water. I say a bit because the first time the camera was used in the ocean, it was dead within 30 minutes. The camera never went below 6 feet, and died in less than 1 foot of water. I suspect the issue had to do with water leaking under the buttons, but that's a guess. All I know is that I took a picture of a fish, the back screen went black, and that was it.Hoping it was just a battery drain issue from using the GPS, I immediately followed the instructions for post-water use(and re-read them prior to opening the case), pulled the battery out and charged it, but the camera never returned to life. I never saw any water inside the battery/memory card chamber when I opened it.Panasonic service was of limited help, as they help asking me to use cables that weren't part of this model to charge it again, and then they realized they were discussing a different unit.

The camera's been dead since, and the pictures and movies on the SD card are in a format that requires the camera to download.When I got home I sought to return the item.  I am extremely disappointed in this camera.  I would never attempt to take it underwater, it is just not made for it.  Reading other comments posted for this item, the door seal needs to be replaced regularly.  I was not aware of that but the camera was new and I had only opened the door a few times.

I purchased the camera several months ahead of time to familiarize myself with it before the big trip.  I found that the camera was quite good for a point & shoot, and liked its ability to absorb bumps, dirt, and splashes without worry.Then came time for our trip to Kauai.  It survived its first challenge - a doors-off helicopter tour where the camera got high-velocity rain pelted at it.  No leaks, great pictures, no worries.  When the weather was good for fall snorkeling, I carefully cleaned and inspected the seal area (as per the instructions), closed, and locked the battery/memory card door.  First snorkel was about 3 hours in total, broken into ~4 separate 30 minute sessions - no deeper than ~5 feet.  When we got back to the rental, I did the specified freshwater rinse & dry.  When I opened the door, there was a very scant amount of moisture - perhaps 1-2 drops on the inside of the door.  It was a small enough amount that it looked like it could have been just water adherant to the seal.  So on the second day, I thought it would be best to limit the underwater time.  After an even more religious inspection of the door & seal, and cleaning any dust with a lenspen brush, I closed & locked the door.  Unfortunately, about 2 minutes into the first trip into the water, the camera display started flickering.  I immediately went to land, and was then faced with a conundrum.  If water is leaking in, and there is saltwater in the electronics, the only hope is to get it out ASAP.  Waiting to do the specified rinse, dry, wait would almost guarantee a failure, because time with the battery still connected would lead to irreversible damage.  I decided the best thing to do was to do a quick rinse with my plain bottled water, dried it off as best I could with a towel, and then opened the door.  There was clear saltwater intrusion.  I popped the battery and SD cards out immediately, and tipped the camera door-down.  Approximately 1 mL of liquid came out.  There was clear corrosion on the cable connectors.  I dried everything out as much as possible, and then continued snorkeling using my old iPhone 3gs in an Aqua Box to take videos (you can't use a capacitive touch screen underwater in salt water) as you could press the record button above water, and then record as you are underwater.When I got home, I opted against submitting a warranty repair, knowing Panasonic's track record on such things.  I did a teardown to see what had failed and whether it could be salvaged.  It appears that the door seal leaked despite my efforts, and the board which handles the battery input is located near the bottom of the case.  It's clear that very little water entered the case, but with saltwater, 2 boards sustained significant electrolytic corrosion damage, and do not appear repairable.Lessons learned:  I would not consider this a waterproof camera.  This camera took little bumps in its pre-snorkel life, but no drops, so that should not have caused the leak.  I followed the instructions, and still ended up with a dead camera.As a sidenote, I think these \"rugged\" \"waterproof\" compact cameras have a significant flaw regarding underwater use.  There is no way to know whether there is water intrusion until it stops working.  Admittedly, the cost of these is very attractive compared to the camera + waterproof case, where the cases often cost more (sometimes considerably more) than the camera.  That being said, you can see leaks starting and bail out before irreparable damage occurs.I give this camera 5 stars for everything up to the tragic loss, 1 star for failure to maintain \"waterproofness\".  Overall, not a bad camera, but I recommend using a case if you're going to use it underwater.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "I like and would recommend this camera (in certain circumstances)", "Author": "stmoad", "ReviewID": "R1TOYNWRFCSZ5V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The thing is, i went through a few (3) point & shoot cameras, which were always with me.  The pocket lint, dust, and rough treatment were to much for them.  So I decided I would look for a more rugged model.  The Lumix DMC TS2 (the model previous to this one) I had was fantastic.  Took great pics, and had all the features i need.  I lost that (Fell out of my pocket during a long bike ride...) and I needed to replace it.  I looked at all of the water/dust proof cameras out there, and was down to 2 choices, the Sony TX10, and the DMC TS3 (these seem to be the only real heavy hitters in the water/dustproof genre) .  When side by side the pics looked pretty comparable, and they both have high res video, etc they seem pretty alike.  There are a few features that sony has (like the sweeping panorama for instance) that is nicer than the Lumix \"line up your last shot with this one\" method, but nothing that was a must-have.The 2 reasons I went with the TS3 are this:  1) the Sony has a sliding cover, which gets stuff (sand for instance) caught under it,or in its hinges, leading to potential breakage, while the Lumix has everything internal, and nothing moves or opens to the outside except a locking door...  And 2) The capacitive touch screen of the sony renders it useless when it gets wet, where the Lumix is completely controlled by push buttons on the top or side of the screen. In the few years i had the Lumix TS2 I rarely used it underwater, but frequently used it in dirty places, dusty places and had it in my pocket often.  So in that the dustproofing was more important than the waterproofing.When reading reviews, a few people were knocking the picture quality, and compare it to SLR style cameras.  This is not that camera, and never will be.  The selling point of this camera is that you can take it virtually anywhere, and any time.  Try comparing pictures taken in a dust storm or under water with your SLR, and the TS3 will win every time.  It is a take anywhere, use any time camera.It is not THAT great at an art camera, but it does take decent pictures (I mean artistically here), not just snapshots - especially if you learn how to adjust the settings to your needs (this means reading the manual, guys I am looking at you).  But if your looking for great art cameras, your looking at a much higher price tag regardless.  I find the pictures to be more than adequate for my needs.  You can print them at 8x10 and have no idea that it was a digital not film image.  The composition of the picture, the lighting, the angles are on you.  The focal length is limited, but that's to be expected.In other regards, this camera has an amazing battery length.  I have a spare (as you always should...) And went to England for 2 weeks.  I took around 1000 pictures and about 1/2 hour of video, and still only needed to change the battery once (to my spare).  The camera is ready to take pics (from off to a shot) quickly.  the shutter response seems pretty quick.  The video looks great.  The quick menus are something I am getting used to (they were not on the TS2) but though limited on what you are 'allowed' to adjust there (As opposed to going in to the in depth menus from another button), they are useful.  It is ergonomic for me, and I have huge hands.  I think the placement of the buttons is intuitive (except i do not like the new placement of the zoom controls), and easy to use on the fly.  The mic picks up sound quite well, and the video is crisp and defined (though I doubt any block buster films will be recorded on one any time soon).  The focus tracking is good at following my baby around.Again not the best P&S; for the money.  Not even comparable to a SLR camera.  But if your looking for something rugged, to take *well above* average shots any where, any time, and not having to worry about the elements ruining your investment, I feel this camera would suit your needs perfectly.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Camera - check in fresh water first", "Author": "Daniel F.

Then I took it snorkeling (same trip) and was under water for 10 to 15 minutes ay a time. When I came out of the water it stopped working.

After messing with it a little bit I find that overall I like it. I figured I'd break it down similar to other reviews.Camera Design. The camera is a little larger than some waterproof point and shoot cameras (E.g., Fuji Z33), however about the same size as the Olympus Tough series. The design makes it easy and comfortable to hold while feeling solid, leaving me with a feeling that I can be a little rough with it without having to baby the camera (like some other point and shoot cameras where the slightest bump will damage the case, etc). The buttons are easy to use, and I found the dedicated video button a nice touch. The scene options are also a nice touch, and all the typical scene features you've come to expect are there. One feature I did like was in the burst mode, it offers you the option for picture amount/speed or quality to adjust the burst settings accordingly. The lock of the battery/sd card slot feels pretty secure. On my vacation, one of the first things I did when I took it out of my pocket on the plane was to immediately drop it onto a metal bar on the floor. Although it made quite a loud *THUD* the camera was fine with no scratches. One thing I found annoying is that the zoom buttons don't really compress when pushed. They obviously don't take much pressure to zoom in and out, but with all the buttons making a sort of click after pushing them and compressing in, it is weird that the zoom buttons are different. This is just a matter of taste though and others may not care. Since getting the camera, it has been dropped several times by myself and friends and it still functions perfectly with no scratches. One note of caution is that if you are used to having the lens on the center of the camera, you may need to watch your finger when taking pictures. Obviously, you will be able to see your finger on the viewer window screen, but some may dislike this design of having the lense close to the left side of the camera (when holding it).Picture Quality. I tried the camera in a variety of settings and found that overall the pictures are pretty good for a rugged camera. I personally think this quality is much better than the quality you will get from any Olympus brand. When put onto the max picture quality, the pictures are quite crisp. I found myself putting them onto my comptuer and zooming in just to see how far they would go before blurring, and to my surprise, they were pretty vivid even after zooming in a great deal. I try to keep the settings on around a medium setting (which creates pictures of about 1-2mb each) in order to save some space on the SD card and my comptuer when transfered, however even in these settings, the pictures are more than sufficient if you are just looking for decent quality and not the quality of a SLR or DSLR. If you are looking such quality you may be disappointed. Not sure why you'd expect this type of quality from a point and shoot, but I did see some people mentioning this \"limitation.\"Video Quality. As with the pictures, on full HD setting the videos are quite good in my opinion. Although once again, they are not quite up to the same level as some HD cameras specfically designed for video. However, overall I am impressed with the detailed quality you can get, especially when viewed on an HD tv or monitor. Similiar to the picture quality, I try to keep the video on a high def setting that is of medium quality which obviously sacrifies video quality, but keeps the videos a bit smaller in size. Despite this, the videos are still clear and good. The camera comes with a \"wind noise\" feature that reduces the noise associated with wind. I honestly didn't seem to notice a huge difference with it on or off, however I wasn't in a very windy area. Either way a cool and nice feature if it works when it is really windy. With that said, the audio quaity is what you would expect from any point and shoot camera with video. Nothing too terrible, but nothing spectacular.Rugged Nature. As i mentioned before, I have dropped the camera several times and have had no problems, or scratches becoming evident. Although I only tried the camera in a sink and bathtub (since my vacation was not to a \"beachy\" place) I have yet to try in the ocean, but from my trials I have found that the case is sturdy enough to not have to worry about water leaking in. When I opened the battery compartment after I put it in the water, it was dry inside with no indication that water had leaked in.Battery. One annoyance that I found with other similar rugged cameras is that you have to take the battery out to charge it. My old casio had a dock which made it significantly easier to charge. Although annoying to me it is not a huge inconvenience, just something I didn't know what I bought (I should have read better). The battery life is okay, but I had hoped for better. I have a habit of using the camera for a few minutes here and there, turning off, and reviewing later, so with this in mind I found that the battery lasts for at least a day of continued usage. With not much usage, the battery lasted a few days, however when I used continuously throughout the day, I had to charge either that night or the next day. For those who use their cameras a lot, this may be a problem, but for me it is adequate.GPS. The GPS is honestly kind of a pain. First thing is I turned on the airplane mode, as everyone suggested since it does drain the battery if left on. With airplane mode on, it often was able to find where it was through satellites and tag the pictures which is a cool feature. However, as others I did have some trouble finding GPS coordinates in some locations. Although not having as much trouble as others, it was still a problem at times.Overall. Overall, I have to say I like the camera and am happy with my purchase. I used to have a Fuji Z33 and loved it, as it was small, easy to use, and the pictures were fairly good. However, after losing it, I found myself looking at different models and was drawn to this one due to the features.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very dissapointing", "Author": "L.

The first time taking it into the water was a little nerve racking because it just looks like a digital camera, but that first picture you take underwater is so worth it!I got this to take with me when my wife and I went to Disney World and I couldn't think of bringing any other camera.  I am a photography hobbyist and would love to be able to bring my DSLR with me everywhere, but I it would be so bulky and in the way at a theme park, this camera was a perfect replacement.  It takes great night shots, you don't have to worry about it on any ride, and it stays out of your way so you can have fun!  The camera takes great hd video which was really fun to film rides like splash mountain.  On water rides when my camera would get wet people would be like, \"your camera got wet! Oh no!\", this is a great time to pretend to freak out.  We brought this to the water parks and I just thought to myself, if we didn't have a waterproof camera we wouldn't even have one picture from that day, there would be no way to bring a normal camera.The GPS is really important to a lot of people, and I'm one of those people now.  It's so cool that when we went to different parks and it would tell you right there on the screen, \"Hollywood Studios,\" and when you get home and upload all those photos, it has the landmark tagged right in there when you look at it in bridge or the cameras software.  The GPS also doesn't draw too much power, I would take about 200 photos and about 6 3min long videos a day without trouble and then charge it that night for the next day.Here are some tips I've learned from using it for my first week that I hope helps someone:*I don't have my camera with me so I can't tell the exact names of all the buttons and menu items-=Photos=--Took me a while to find the different photo options, but when you click the mode button you can choose \"scenes\" and you will be able to choose things like \"night handheld\" and a bunch of fun options-when asking other people to shoot photos for you, warn them where the lens is because it's easy to get your finger in the picture if you hold it like other cameras-=Videos=--When you open the quick menu there is a LED light option, use this to turn the light on because at night you really won't capture anything without it-Use the cameras software to get the video off the camera because it will convert all the files it stores into 3 files for your computer, one has the information that the camera captures, like gps and date created.  The others is the video, and the last one is a file that if you open in a text document will have the plain text of the videos info again.  If you don't do it this way you probably will have a hard time getting that information, and I'm almost positive that the camera data isn't stored in the video file so if that's all you get off the camera then that data will probably be lost.-=GPS=--Go into the gps menu and you can have it display the landmark, city, state, ect. which was helpful.-If you want to get the gps data to update it helps a lot if you go into the gps menu and click the reposition button and it will find it a little quicker.  A watched gps never positions!-The gps doesn't take that much battery so don't worry about trying to turn it off or put it on airplane mode, you will probably waste more battery trying to have it relocate you when you turn it back on then just leaving it on, though if you need to sacrifice gps for battery then that is an option, you can use exiftools later to transfer the gps info from a different photo later.-=Eye-Fi Cards=--I love eye-fi cards and they work with this camera despite what their website says, but if you use it to transfer to your computer by transferring it through the android app, it will lose some of the richer gps information from the exif data such as the landmark.  It will still be in the maker's notes in the exif data but you will probably need exiftools to fix the makers notes offset.Overall I love this camera and couldn't be happier with it.

Proceed at your own risk.I've had this camera on my wish list forever, it's more or less the go to camera for adventure motorcycle riders.  Rugged, everything-proof, east to use with gloves on, etc.  When my wife said we needed a new camera to get better pictures of our newborn daughter, I suggested this, she ok'd, and we bought it.I got the camera through Amazon's Warehouse Deals shop because I've had great luck with them in the past.  It arrived on time (August 4th) and I unpacked it to check it out.  The first thing I noticed was it was an open box and despite repacking the box, someone neglected to removed the post-it note from the original purchaser that was stuck to the front of the manual.  No bother, it's minor.  I played around with it and despite all the great features, noticed an annoyance; the camera required me to press to power button twice to turn it on.  After some thought, I decided it was enough to warrant a call to customer service.After 45 minutes of going through everything I'd already tried with the tech on the phone, they told me to send it back.  To my surprise, it took a lot of convincing to get them to cover shipping on this, which was odd as it is well within the warranty period.  In hindsight I should have sent it directly back to Amazon but as it was a Warehouse deal, I was pretty sure I couldn't simply exchange it for a brand new one.  Bad decision.  I shipped the camera back to Panasonic's repair facility in Texas on August 5th.The early customer service process was fine, they called to inform me they got the camera, and called back a few days later to tell me it was in for repairs and I'd have it back within 10 business days.  The 10 days elapsed and they called again to tell me that parts had been ordered and the camera was waiting for repairs.  I called back and left an angry message as they had obviously misinformed me.  I waited a few days for a response and got none, but did get another message reiterating that parts had been ordered but not giving me an ETA.  At this point it was already the end of August, meaning my new camera had been out of my hands for about a month.I decided to try to email customer service, who also took a long time to respond and ended up just giving me the same phone number I already had.  I tried to get more from them with no success.  I grumbled and decided to cool off for a few days.  Early September rolls around and I get the exact same message, parts are ordered and it's waiting for repairs, no other information.  I told the rep to have someone that could give me an ETA call me back, but after a few days I got no call back.  I tried calling back within business hours, three times and the phone just keeps ringing.  I called later in the day and finally get a hold of someone.  When I asked to speak to a manager, he took my name and said she'd call right back.  Two days later and I had to call again because I never heard from them.  Same response, so again I insisted that a manager call me back ASAP.  Another two days and I was losing my mind.  I called the main customer service line again, and after about 20 minutes of waiting, was told that the managers were in a meeting and would call me back.  I will give this rep credit, he took my entire story down and was the most helpful yet.  But, again, no call back.  I started looking hard for the CEO's home phone number or something, I couldn't believe how badly this was going.  Finally, on September 15th I got a call back from a rep at the repair facility saying the parts were in and the camera was getting repaired the next day.I received the camera yesterday, September 19th.  It was well packed and they did spring for UPS Next Day Saver, which was a silver lining.  Still, it took 45 days for me to get my camera back after shipping it.  Do you now how much changes with a newborn in 45 days?  A ton, and though my iPhone takes fine pictures, it's not the same.  I also had to find another camera for two big motorcycle rides that the TS3 should have been present on(again the iPhone stepped up).  I can't for the life of me figure out why they didn't just send a replacement.  I was not quiet in my anger at the process and won't be quiet about my dislike for the company, and they have lost me as a customer for good.  A large part of me wants to return the camera to Amazon, but I'm not even sure they'd accept it now.  I am so soured on the whole company from this ordeal that I've come to loathe the little blue brick.Sorry for the novel, I'm just completely blown away by how bad this experience was and the complete lack of respect.  A few notes on the camera:Pros:-Waterproof, freezeproof, shockproof, etc.  This thing is a tank and I will put it through it's paces.  There's a reason it's on top of the rugged camera heap.  I expect years of use out of it.-Image stabilization is good, as is the auto mode.  It takes good pictures out of the box, and if you want to customize them more, the options are there.-Dedicated record button for video, no modes to shuffle through.-GPS, not sure how much I'll use it but I do like that feature.-Buttons are usable (but not easy) with gloves on.  I'll have this on a retractable \"leash\" for shooting while riding and thus far, it looks like it will perform just fine.Cons:-It's big, this is not a compact camera.  Still pocketable, but the comparable Sony is notably smaller.-Screen resolution could be better.-Proprietary battery, just an annoyance, but inconvenient for international travel.-The menus aren't overly intuitive, but they're not bad once you get used to them.-Better hope you get a working one, see above if you don't and just return directly to Amazon.I sincerely hope someone high up at Panasonic reads this and looks further into their repair process.

I wanted a waterproof camera which would produce high-quality photos in all settings (indoor, outdoor, and underwater.  My intention was to completely replace my 7.2MP Sony DSC-W7, which I LOVE.  I wanted to add the underwater feature without compromising on other features.  I did not want to spend more than about $400 for everything (camera, two 8GB memory cards (Class 10), two extra batteries with charger, and float strap.  This left me with about $340 max to spend on the camera itself.  I do NOT know a lot about photography.  Terms like \"ISO\" and \"white balance\" are foreign to me.  I like to use pre-programmed scene modes and auto features.  I enjoy digital scrapbooking and I frequently zoom and crop.  It takes a very high quality photo to crop out/enlarge a small figure without too much distortion.I began my search online and spent about 6 hours researching the cameras in my price range.  The cameras I focused on most were the Canon D10, Sony TX10, Panasonic TS3 (sometimes referred to as FT3), Olympus TG-810, Olympus Tough 8010, Fujifilm XP30, and Pentax WG-1.I eliminated most of these options rather quickly based on their reviews, overall ratings, and the quality of photos that I reviewed.  I narrowed my focus to the Canon D10, the Sony TX10, and the Panasonic TS3.I wanted to love the Canon D10, since it seems to be the overwhelming fan favorite, but I ultimately decided that it wasn't going to be a good fit for me.  The price of the D10 is similar to the Sony and the Panasonic, but it's a 2.5 year old model which doesn't have HD video.  The photo quality seemed about equivalent to the other two, so I decided to only focus on the two models with HD video.I would have been completely sold on the Sony, since I've used only Sony cameras most of my adult life and I've never been disappointed in one; however, there were some notable deficiencies which most reviewers found with this model (detailed below), so I was a bit hesitant to take the plunge.  The Sony was also priced near the top of my budget ($329), whereas the Panasonic was only $275 at Amazon.com.  The Panasonic reviews seemed to all be very positive, with the only significantly commonly-noted problem being lower quality indoor photos.  However, all of the indoor, outdoor, and underwater photos that I reviewed online looked very good.I decided to take a chance on the Panasonic TS3 and I really, really, wanted to fall in love with it.  I ordered it from Amazon and they delivered it the next day.  I wasn't blown away by this camera.  The outdoor photos were good.  The video was very good.  The underwater photos (taken in my large fish tank) were very good.  The indoor photos were POOR.  I decided to order the Sony TX10, hoping that I'd see better results.  I ordered it from Amazon at 9pm that night and it was delivered at 1:00pm the next day (gotta love Amazon!).  The photo quality of the Sony camera is outstanding.  I'll be keeping the Sony TX10!!!  For some people, however, the Panasonic might be the better choice.First, I'll provide my overall recommendations, then I'll add in all of the detail:BUY THE SONY TX10 IF:You value the quality of the photos/video above all else.You like touch screen devices.You don't plan to dive lower than 16 feet.You don't care if you can't adjust your settings (other than zoom) underwater.You want a VERY small camera.You always use a wrist strap.BUY THE PANASONIC TS3 IF:You can live with grainy indoor photos.You don't typically enlarge your photos to 100% (because they will be distorted).You want a camera with GPS.You plan to dive deeper than 16 feet.You want a larger (but not too big) camera.You're looking for a less expensive option.NOW FOR MY DETAILED COMMENTS ON BOTH MODELS:PRICE - The Sony is +/- $50 more expensive than the Panasonic.SIZE - The Sony is significantly smaller and lighter than the Panasonic.  I don't think one is better than the other, per se.  It's a matter of personal preference.  The Sony will fit in most pockets.  The Panasonic probably wouldn't.RUGGEDNESS - Both cameras are rated very well in this area.  I haven't \"tested\" them, but it seems like the Panasonic is built a bit tougher and would be less likely to get destroyed in a fall.  Rather than test this feature, I'm going to just trust the experts that either one will hold up well if dropped.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Waterproof camera", "Author": "Rick Mcdaniel \"R.D.M.\"", "ReviewID": "R2IDH68YOZHHSM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far I haven't used this camera much so I may have to edit my review later. I'm an avid whitewater kayaker so I need a small waterproof camera and I have had a few so I feel that I can be objective as to what is good and what isn't.  This camera feels solid and it's a nice size, big enough to hang onto and be able to manipulate the controls without being too bulky. The controls are simple to use so with a little fiddling around I've been able to find how to access the features that I need without continually reading the owners manual. I do have to be aware to keep the fingers of my left hand from being in front of the lens. I appreciate that the door housing the battery and memory chip has a positive locking system so it's not likely that I'll not close it completely and drown the camera like I did my Canon D-10 on the 4th day of a 19 day trip down the Colorado river through the Grand Canyon. By the way I know of at least one other person who killed a Canon D-10 the same way so maybe Canon could learn something from Panasonic. I'm looking foreword to using the burst mode to get some great shots of my friends running rapids, instead of trying to time the shot just right I will start shooting just as they get to the top of the drop and keep shooting till they get to the bottom. Then I can pick the best and delete the rest, pretty neat!  On a recent trip I managed to leave my brand new camera at home. A friend also has a Panasonic Lumix and asked me to take pictures with his camera. The weather was cold and raining and I had trouble getting the water/fog off of the lens. I kept wiping it to no avail and got several pictures that were foggy and distorted. I forgot to try spitting on the lens and then rinsing it, that usually works.  11/17/12  After having this camera for a while now I'll update my review. This is one rugged camera! It has held up very well and hasn't yet let me down. It has been on many adventures with me. My wife and I took it to Yellowstone and glacier Nat. Parks in the summer of 2011. I got some fantastic pictures. The summer of 2012 we went to Kauai, lots of great pics while snorkeling as well as great pics out of the water too. I've used the burst mode for kayaking shots and it is very cool. Video is great also.

The third trip however proved to be the camera's last. After a day of taking photos while splashing on the beach, the TS3 began acting up. Fog appeared on the inside of the camera over the lens element, making it impossible to take any worthwhile photos.This issue soon spread to sections of the LCD screen - but cleared after waiting a few moments. I thought perhaps the fogging was due to the temperature difference between the cold water and warm air - so continued to shoot.That is when the LCD screen began flickering on and off and the camera became completely inoperable. Attempting to review photos displayed a message that the display ration was set wrong - yet I was unable to get into any menu to fix it.It was at this point I gave up wasting my time with the camera and went on enjoying my vacation.To give you some background on myself - I am an avid photographer as well as a admitted gadget geek. I take extremely good care of my toys, and enjoy reading every page of an owners manual.I took great care when it came to my TS3 - brushing the seal with the included brush to remove any dust or sand that might compromise the waterproof seal as well as soaking the camera in fresh water after every use.I did not use the camera in any manner that would have been considered 'above and beyond' normal expectations, yet after only a few trips I am left with a non-operable camera.After reading about other's experiences with Panasonic support, I'm opting to just completely wash my hands of this camera and call it a total loss.Buyer beware.", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do not buy!

From the reviews I read, I understood that this camera took good (not excellent) pictures and video, and with a $360 price tag, it should be waterproof as well.  I live a very active lifestyle on Okinawa, Japan, and I wanted a camera that I could take with me on the go.  I have a Canon EOS Rebel that I am very happy with, but for obvious reasons, this is not the camera to take with you while you go snorkeling or surfing and doesn't fit neatly into my wife's purse when we go out to dinner.  But, alas, my dreams of putting this (very expensive) camera into my boardshorts when I went surfing on small days or taking pictures of the reef and fish here were crushed my wife swam up to me in the ocean and said \"I think the camera battery died\".  We came home and I washed off the camera in the faucet and then opened it up to charge the battery.  After charging, I put it back in, and I could hear the camera working but the screen did not turn on.  Upon further investigation, I saw condensation inside lens and I knew I would sending this back for warranty service.  Although extremely disappointed that water got into my \"waterproof\" camera, I consoled myself with the fact that the camera was still under its extremely short 6 month warranty.  I would also like to point out the fact that I had this camera in the ocean only about 5 or so times total.  After mailing in the camera, I received word that the warranty repair service wanted $180.25 to fix the repair.  I called the warranty repair service to clarify, because this was obviously a mistake since (1) my camera was under warranty and (2) I have only used this camera within its given specifications i.e. I never took it below the  surface more than 12m (it actually never got below about 1m).  However, the repair service center said that the camera was out of warranty due to \"corrosion\" caused by improper cleaning.  I am not sure where the corrosion was, because I did not see any visible.  I did run the camera under the faucet after use, but for those of us who live near the ocean, you know it is impossible to get that stuff out from everywhere.

In terms of experience, I would classify myself as an advanced amateur.  I was a little concerned that there were several reports of water leakage in brand new TS-3s.  There were however, an equal or greater number of reviews from people who loved this camera.  Having used waterproof cameras before, and knowing how sensitive they are to the least bit of \"mistreatment\", I concluded that the people that had leaky cameras had not properly followed operating instructions.  And since I am a very careful person (some say to a fault), I figured leakage would not be an issue for me.  I now know that is NOT the case, as I'll describe later.I obtained the camera about a month in advance of our trip and I took the time to read all of the instructions.  Please note that only a very basic guide comes with the camera; the more detailed instruction manual must be printed out from the CD that accompanies the camera.  Grrrrr.  Annoyance #1I took the camera out and took some shots to familiarlize myself with its operation.  Each time you turn on the camera the screen flashes a warning about locking the battery/SD compartment to prevent leakage before using the camera underwater.  This was more than a little annoying.  So, I checked the instructions and followed the directions which were supposed to disable this warning.  It didn't. I decided I'd just have to live with seeing the warning each time I turned on the camera - not a big deal.  Later, it became a big deal because I had to wait so long for the warning to go away that I missed some great shots.  Annoyance #2I was pretty disappointed in the quality of the test shots.  Not particularly sharp.  Color rendition off.  And I found it did not have as many potential settings as my other Lumix point and shoot - very limited, with little creative freedom.  Annoyance #3.But since we didn't have much time before our trip, I decided it was \"good enough\" at least for underwater photos while snorkeling.  I had other, better cameras to use for land-based photography.  Off we went to the Galapagos....Day 2 of our 8 day trip I took this camera in the water while snorkeling.  I had followed the operating instructions precisely, and almost immediately the camera started malfunctionning.  The screen flashed on and off, and I was only able to get off a few shots before it quit working.  This is beyond an annoyance.  This is unacceptable.Upon returning to the boat, I soaked the camera in fresh water as instructed, then thoroughly dried it off.  Immediately upon opening the compartment to remove the SD card, I noted a drop of water inside the compartment.  I removed the SD card and battery and left the compartment open to air dry overnight.  I hoped it was an isolated incident, but had my doubts....The following day...the camera came back to life, but the same thing happened.  I got off about a dozen  shots, in between having the screen flash on and off.  Again, water droplets inside when I opened the compartment.  I left it to dry overnight.  And it worked fine on land the next day, but leaked immediately when we went snorkeling with it.If you want to see the shots I made with it, go to Days 2 and 3 of: [...]At that point, it simply became too frustrating to even try to use this camera in the water.  We gave up on it.  Since returning to land and apparently drying out, it has again come back to life.  But since I'm not crazy about the camera overall, I never use it.I've read the other reviews where Panasonic has denied culpability for water leakage, saying that operating instructions were not followed, and trying to charge customers outrageous sums to fix what is clearly a bad camera.  Since I know this is what they will likely do with me too, and I don't want to invest one penny more in this piece of junk, I'm not even going to pursue it with them.But I do want to warn other potential purchasers away from this camera.

I checked again when we got back under 50 ft and IT WAS WORKING AGAIN.came out of the water Max depth gauge read 61 ft.  the seal didnt fail and I got some incredible pics. (see 2 pics with the camera 1st showing depth guage and second of a friend I found at 45 ft.)Have been on 6 more dives and the camera went to a max depth of.... get this 82 ft !!! See the picture of my depth gauge  without the seals failing. Keep in mind it completely lost funtionality after say 55ft, but above 50 ft it works fine.not sure how to post pics but I always took pics of my depth gauge to back up my pics. ( I didnt figure out till the last dive how to set the depth gauge indicator on the camera.Plain and Simple. This camera rocks.  It works perfect to about 50ft, but can handle depths of up to 80ft.

Seeing as I spend a lot of time fishing and around water, I thought it'd be great to have a camera that could withstand a lot of splashing and maybe the occasional dunking.  And after semi-manually geotagging photos for the last couple years having a built-in GPS sounded fantastic.Alas, maybe I got a lemon, but after using this camera now for a week, including at a wedding and on a couple hikes, I am very disappointed with the picture quality and the GPS.  Images captured on my camera are distinctly fuzzy and almost always over exposed when using the automatic settings.  Light levels don't seem to be even across the images either, the top right quadrant always seems to be lighter than the rest of the picture.  Compared to the images taken with my 4 year old Canon, these are clearly less rich and less detailed.  I set up the camera outdoors with a tripod and went through all of the possible manual and automatic settings trying to improve the picture quality in a controlled experiment and never found a combination of settings I thought produced a good picture.The GPS in my unit was also problematic.  Even when walking across open areas outdoors, far away from any interference, it could take up to 20 minutes to acquire a location and many times never found its coordinates.  My iPhone in the same location (no wifi nearby, no cell phone signal) usually obtained bearings in less than a minute, and never failed outright.  Forget about finding coordinates indoors or under tree cover.On the plus side, the camera is clearly quite rugged and though maybe a bit larger than expected, still a good design for outdoor adventures.I am very tempted to send this camera back, I'm not happy with it at all.

I may have lost as many as 10% of the images due to the camera, two computers and 2 different card readers not being able to read the images off the card.

My job requires diving so I knew I had to find a great camera that was point and shoot, this was so perfect and very easy to use.I knocked off a star because when I was closer in shore and using it, there were times sand would kick up when the waves would break. Well, sand got stuck in the zoom buttons and it was SUCH a pain trying to get it out. The buttons would not work at all and I had to keep rinsing it non-stop. Besides that, no complaints.I was able to use this camera for SO many occasions. I also thought it took great pictures out of water as well. I saw a comment about someone saying that they thought they were grainy. I blew my photos up and had no similar experience.I will suggest ALWAYS having a floatation wrist strap on the camera. I took a trip to CA to visit family and friends and thought I wouldn't need my big obnoxious floaty strap. Well, I ended up taking a trip to Lake Havasu with them for the big annual float. I took my chances and brought my precious camera.. I got out of my tube to swim a bit and a random gust of wind came out of no where and flipped my tube upside down.

In clear water with cooperating fish, photos were sometimes surprisingly good for such a little camera and I was very happy with overall results.What I really and absolutely loved were the underwater videos - lack of color and some hazyness if water was turbulent didn't matter when seals were flying through the water around you. The videos alone were worth every penny of this camera.During this trip, I experienced no leakage. However, I was VERY careful to follow instructions, soaked, dried and dusted. 2 other guests had underwater cameras and 1 flooded due to operator error. Sorry, readers! I believe a lot of times, it is our own fault.Out of the water, the camera performed alright. Picture quality suffers greatly when you zoom but for panorama or macros, it did just fine.

This camera rocks for the price.I have used this camera for numerous dives for work (Underwater bridge inspection)Dived in 3 knot current and the camera did excellent, very difficult to hold still in these conditions, a couple of blurred images but once stabilized, images came out great.Underwater video works very well, however as noted by another review if you block the microphone you'll hear all the auto focus motors etc on the video audio. This is evident during underwater too, as the water somewhat blocks the opening.but it is a small price to pay.Flash from this camera underwater is about useless, probably works really well in a pool with good vizability and no floating/suspended material in the water column,but during all my working dives where I tried using a flash resulted in illuminating the dirt particles in the water and causing back scatter/snow to appear in the images. This is because the flash and lens are in close axial alignment, same reason why you get red eye in pictures.My cure for the flash back scatter was to purchase an Underwater kinetics SL4 LED flash light and inserting a piece of diffuser material (Artist velum, tracing paper) into the flash light lens this results in a nice soft diffused light source. The light can then be positioned in any orientation away from the lens axis but still allowing the object to be illuminated successfully.My only gripe about this camera is the lock mechanism, the little slide switch I have noticed a few times has the orange warning section exposed, when removing the camera from an underwater tool bag.As far as maintenance the camera requires rinsing for 10 mins and allowing to dry before the compartment door is open. I would soak the camera in the hotel sink in the evenings after working all day and then allow to dry over night before opening the compartment door and downloading the images.An underwater housing is available for this camera also, if you are planning on diving deeper than 40ft I would highly suggest purchasing.Either the Ikelite Underwater TTL Camera Housing $259 or the Panasonic Marine Case for Lumix TS3 Digital Camera - DMW-MCFT3 $255, this adds great versatility and piece of mind to a great camera.Another option for better underwater lighting is the SeaLife SL980 Underwater Photo/Video Light with Arm Bracket, but that is priced at $300+ it also adds considerable bulk to the equipment.Images from the camera are excellent.

I suggest you ensure that the camera is very dry on the inside before you enter cold water to avoid condensation. The easiest way to do this is to buy a big bag of dessicant, dry out same using a microwave oven, then place the sack and the camera in a sealed zip lock bag with the camera doors open. Let the dessicant do it's magic (overnight?) and then close the door ASAP after drying the camera out. However, for something as warm as regular pool water, letting the camera dry out under a cold AC vent overnight worked also.All in all, I am very happy with the camera. I dialed down the MP, as the tiny lens probably cannot properly resolve 12MP anyway. Plus, I get a lot more pictures out of the 32GB storage card I paired with this camera.

Some reviewers said they had a problem with the lens fogging up due to the temperature difference when going from the beach to the water.

At the recommendation of other reviewers, I bought a second battery, but I really didn't need it. (Be sure you have the latest firmware, and turn off the GPS feature unless you really need it.) Two minor things I would like to see addressed in future designs are: 1) the location of the mic hole for video recording is in a bad spot- right on top where it is way too natural to cover with your left finger when you hold the camera, and 2) when you aim the camera in the general direction from where the sun is shining (not directly at the sun though), depending on the angle of your shot and the intensity of the light you may see a vertical bar of light that divides the screen when played back on your computer.

However, carrying close to 20 lbs of photo equipment and worrying about it being smacked against a rock or drawn in a stream doesn't mix well with me. So after my last big trip I figured that I want two have two sets - one for photo-op trips and another for outdoor trips. And it proved to be good (like Bill Cosby used to say - Good, not excellent, but just good).First things first - image quality will depend greatly on the conditions - in bright light it will likely to be very close to DSLR, in low-light don't expect it to be stellar. But by the definition the rugged compact design with ability to withstand drops and underwater capabilities is intended for use outdoors, not indoor.The wide angle lens allows to capture scenery well, while decent 4x zoom (without use of optical zoom) is sufficient to get you close enough to the subject.There are three basic ways to set up camera - \"intelligent\" iAuto, simple, and plenty of picture specific modes to choose from which will preset camera's settings to the most efficient mode for white balance, exposure and shutter speed (out of which 3D, Sport, UnderWater and Beach mode are accessible directly). iAuto will try to get best setting for situation, but it does make mistake, so I opt for either simple or picture specific mode. There is a 3D mode (which I'm yet to test on my 3D TV).The couple of minor drawbacks are ergonomics and interface - are again quite understandable given design restriction of tiny camera. Using zoom in/out buttons is a bit inconvenient for one handed operations (although quite possible). The power button is too close to shutter and dedicated video button - too many times I switched off camera instead of taking a shot or video. Menu is somewhat clunky and complicated. But being as spoiled as I am with highly ergonomic designed bodies of DSLR cameras, this is something I can live with at a fraction of cost and weight involved.A couple things I'd like to mention in particular are UnderWater mode and GPS operation. I've been wanting to dip a camera since I first tried disposable underwater camera. However, I could never find the camera reviewed well enough to venture with and didn't have enough courage to stick a few thousand buck worth of photo stuff in underwater casing. Now I can experiment all that I want.Another cool thing I wanted to see in camera since Nikon D90 first introduced in DSLR is a built-in GPS unit. You probably won't be using it to navigate, but it is nice to stick photos to the places they were taken. The operation is not flawless (it may take a little while to get the location right) but it is good enough. I have it on Plane mode, when GPS is activated any time the camera is switched on. Since I turn off camera every time after taking pictures (to avoid battery drain from LCD operation) is proved to be perfect.At last, despite my preference to regular battery powered devices I can see benefits of using the compact dedicated battery.

However the image quality in my opinion is sub-par but that was expected given that it a rugged camera. It is still pretty decent though(look at the picture I uploaded; its the sunset and red flower pictures). Plus I have a DSLR camera for when I want quality. The key to getting a great picture is using the different modes(scene modes) because this camera doesn't have much manual control(you can control iso and white balance that's it). So by using the scene mode you get the advantage of the preset color and other setting. There are scene modes for each situations and each one has a different function for example you can take long exposure shots (15,30,60 sec) with 'Starry Nights' (use a tripod though) and 'Night Portrait' reduces red eye(this is important because the flash is very close to the lens and so red eyes are more likely to happen). In fact by using the Scene Modes you can use this camera for artistic purposes. Now unto the video capability, what can I say it is wonderfully sharp if you have enough light(like outside). I would say that one 100watt light bulb in a 10' by 12' room is still watchable(btw the camera has tiny LED video light).

I went snorkeling for almost an hour taking pictures and video with no problems.  I didn't have to worry about sand getting in anything and have even dropped it with no problems.  If you get something on it, just wash it off.  For the size of the camera it takes nice pictures and does pretty well in low light.  The video is technically HD and it does look pretty good but is not true HD quality.  I would stay away from the AVCHD video because it can be a nightmare to work with or even view.  Use the MPEG instead.The flash performance was average but most of the time I could get away with not using it. Took many pictures at 800 ASA and 1600 and they were pretty decent especially with the image stabilization.  A nice touch is that the LED can be used as a camera light when taking video.The quick menu was great and easy to use, allowing you to set ASA, white balance, quality, GPS, etc quickly.  The unit powers on really quickly and having a dedicated video button is great.  I was able to use the camera all day, on one battery, leaving it on for extended periods, using GPS and taking pictures and video.The lens has a nice wide end but doesn't zoom too far.  I hate digital zoom and refuse to use it but the Extra Optical Zoom feature is nice and looked good.  If you use any setting lower than the 12 MP you can use a subset of the chip to zoom the image further.  Frankly a 10 MP or even 7 MP picture is just fine and you get a little more zoom as well.The only gripe I have is that the unlike the Olympus ruggedized camera which has a metal lens cover the TS3 has none. I was constantly cleaning the lens which got really annoying. The lens does have a fairly large and deep ring around it, so it's unlikely the lens with get scratched through use, but it's more likely you will scratch it by constant cleaning. Make sure to have the included brush with you so the lens can be dusted before being wiped down.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works fine (so far)", "Author": "ValhallaSystems", "ReviewID": "R3BSW6H4KPA73O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have not dropped it to test that feature, neither have I taken it underwater (yet).

The SCN settings cover anything you need: low light, high light, high speed burst photos, etc. The audio and video are also a great quality. The battery life of the camera is really great. Decent macro setting. Quick camera speed (click the button and the photo is taken). Menu is really easy to navigate.Cons...panoramic mode does not stitch photos for you.

The minor salt water incursion has not affected anything, except my willingness to take the camera below a few feet depth. Never tried to return it as there's nothing wrong. All functions working well, no new problems. Have traveled all over the place with the camera just thrown in my backpack, and it doesn't seem to mind at all. The GPS has proved to be weak compared to my iPhone or outdoors GPS unit, but with a good sky view it works well.*** Update to first part (which appears below)***After a week's vacation...Took the TS3 to the Caribbean for various activities on the beach, in the water, and on land. I'm still impressed with the image quality and overall performance. Video is very nice too. I took it along on two beach trips, just into the water but not at any depth, with the accompanying sand and dirt. Followed the prescribed rinse / dry / seal cleaning with the included brush and no problems.BUT, then I went snorkeling with it to depths of 15 - 20 feet (half the rated level) for about 45 minutes. Got great stills and videos that live up to the claims. Upon returning to the boat I took the camera to the head and soaked / lightly rinsed followed by shaking off excess moisture and drying. When I tried to use it about 10 mins later the screen started to flash and it would not take photos. I immediately opened the door with it positioned down so any liquid would drain away from the battery / card, and found a drop or two of water in there that had gotten onto the USB / Video connectors; there was visible corrosion. I blotted up the drops, removed the battery and SD card,and closed it up. On returning to my room a couple of hours later I carefully swiped off the contacts with a slightly moistened piece of stiff paper, which removed the visible corrosion. After an hour of drying with the door open, the camera again works fine. No water had penetrated to the battery or SD contacts or into the bulk of the camera, but just the same this was not what I expected. Thus I docked a star from my rating.I will attempt a warranty repair / replace, but I don't think I'll take it below a foot or so of depth after this experience (which is similar to others have reported here). Even though I followed the instructions it failed anyway.*** Original Review ***Only had it for 24 hours, but I wanted to write down my initial impressions. I purchased the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS3 and a Transcend 16 GB Class 10 SDHC card to replace my older Nikon Coolpix S560 point and shoot purchased in 2008. Well, no comparison really. The technology has advanced considerably in the 3 years since I got the Nikon. I paid just about the same for the Nikon in 2008 as for the TS3. For a quick comparison, I took the same composition on both cameras, flash and without flash, and the TS3 comes out light years ahead in resolution, color quality, lack of fringing and jpeg side effects, etc., let alone the video, location features, and many more. So, onward to the new camera, old one goes off to auction somewhere or maybe I'll give it to my daughter.Played with the TS3 a little taking shots and videos of the dogs, just to get the feel of it. The user interface is similar to the Nikon and many other cameras of this type, so I had no problems learning the basics. I haven't dunked it in the pool yet; that will wait for the next warm weather water opportunity. But I did take it on a hike today to test the GPS and Intelligent Auto mode. For the most part GPS was pretty accurate. I took along my 'real' outdoors GPS receiver that I know is accurate to less than 10 feet or so, and then compared the GPS metadata in the pictures by plotting waypoints for each picture overlaid on the GPS track of the 3-mile or so hike with my spouse and our dogs. She took the pictures and turned the camera off and on a few times, with the GPS set to 'always on.' Most of the 20 or so photos were spot on, but one came out positioned about 50 feet northeast of the track. Then the GPS seemed to stop working, and the last few jumped to a single point about 15 miles southeast of the true position. Not sure what happened there; nothing different about tree cover or clouds, and the outdoors receiver continued to work. Could have been related to turning the camera off long enough for the GPS to deactivate, and then not waiting long enough after powering back on to get a good fix. We didn't look at the displayed GPS status so it's hard to say. Next time I'll try to pay more attention. Anyway, GPS seems to work very well when it was working and properly initialized.Intelligent Auto mode had no problem switching to macro mode when close to some mushrooms, and the rest of the photos of medium to long-range objects were fine. The flash functioned well on macro and normal shots. Overall exposure was accurate, although underexposed by ~ 1/2 stop. Auto white balance was correct for the overcast day.Leaving GPS on almost all the time, taking about 50 photos (maybe 40% flash) and around 10 mins of HD video, the battery is less than half used.Overall I'm very satisfied with the DMC-TS3 performance. Next challenge -- using it underwater or in other adverse conditions where I wouldn't dare take my SLR.

Ako", "ReviewID": "RIVICGXQBHFOY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Panasonic DMC-TS3 is a very good camera for the application it was designed for. It excels in photography during bad weather, on the beach, swimming pool, hiking, etc...This is a perfect complement to my Nikon DSLR because this camera can go places that I dare not take a multi Kilo$ DSLR. I purchased this camera to replace an ancient Pentax Optio 33WR & the electronics in the TS3 are many generations ahead of my old camera.The shutter lag is very short for a point & shoot. The TS3 is a full featured camera that is very likeable.Many people read reviews to see the bad stuff, so here are a few things I found irritating:1. There is no optical viewfinder as there is on my old Pentax 33WR. A viewfinder is very helpful when bright ambient light (usually outdoors, where this camera was designed to operate!) washes out the LCD screen. However, this is a common problem with every current generation water resistant camera I have seen, regardless of who the manufacturer is.2. The Panasonic uses a proprietary rechargeable battery. My old Pentax used AA NiMH rechargeables or even alkalines in a pinch. When traveling, especially internationally, the AA battery is found everywhere. Commonality comes in handy if your battery fails. Again, this is a common problem with every current generation water resistant camera I have seen.3. While photographing some furniture indoors, I noticed a lot more glare being picked up with the TS3 than I could see with my own eyes. I am not sure if this is the cause, but there is no IR filter in front of the CMOS sensor! This may be common to many point & shoots. My Nikon DSLR does not do this.4. In general, the images are a little on the soft side.Other things that I found useful:1. Olympus sells a competent Neoprene Sport Case (Olympus 202320) that fits the Panasonic TS3 like it was made for it. Excellent scratch protection. It is sold on Amazon for $6.82 on the date of this review. Great price Amazon!2. Amazon also sells \"Wasabi Power Battery and Charger Kit for Panasonic... TS3\", consisting of 2 batteries & a charger. So far everything works well with this kit & is a bargain at $29.99.Bottom line is that I do recommend this camera. The shortcomings are common to all water resistant cameras of this generation, not just with Panasonic. This so happens to be one of the best if not the best water resistant point & shoot camera available during the time of this review.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "DMC TS3 - Six months, leaking, still working", "Author": "westerndiver", "ReviewID": "R2UHVYL7BZW6HA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for six months, using it when I go sailing, diving, and general travelling.I'll echo what everyone else says about size and general durability. It's size makes it a great traveller and it can take a lot of abuse. I love this camera.But what I found out is that though this camera is marketed as waterproof, it's not really. The double lock door and little rubber gaskets do an admirable job of keeping water out and under most conditions it will likely stay dry, but Panasonic would have take it another notch up to make it really waterproof under field conditions.So here's some tips:- If you're going snorkeling or diving, use some waterproof athletic tape to help the door stay in place. I think that's why mine leaked, the roughhousing you find in the water probably jarred it just enough to seep.- Before you open the camera's access door Make Sure the Camera is DRY. The natural tendency is to open the door face up which means any water hiding in the door or gasket goes into the camera. Use a paper towel, newspaper, or toilet paper to dry the door area then open it face down.- If you get corrosion on the contacts, use a product called DEOXIT(RadioShack). Works great.- If you find water in the camera, Don't Turn It On (you knew that). Take everything out and let it dry for a couple of days. Mine came back to life with no problems.One of these days I'll do something to this camera and it'll croak for good, and in a heartbeat I'll buy another one.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this camera, huge disappointment", "Author": "Stainless", "ReviewID": "R1R0MS008H27NO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I looked hard at waterproof cameras.

I had to search for another rugged camera and then we took a cab to the camera store to buy it. At the time it was much more expensive then what the TS-3 is now on Amazon. My husband choked but at the time our son and daughter were even younger. They like to grab mommy's camera and take pictures...needless to say they are both dropping it constantly on various surfaces including concrete. I can tell you it has taken a lot of abuse from those 2 and it is still taking pictures. Of course you don't buy a small camera like this to take the best pictures you have...you buy it because of it's size and ease of use. I think the pictures are good enough. The underwater part is also great when you want to take pics of the kids under the water and they turn out great.I have the orange one and love the color.THIS VIDEO IS FROM THE TS-1 underwater...if this one is this good...I imagine the TS-3 would be much better.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "capable off-road camera", "Author": "Lyle A.

It takes beautiful pictures both insides and out.  It is fairly easy to use and set up.  It fits in my husband's pocket, which is a must when we travel.  The screen is large and makes it easy to see the shot you are trying to get.  It has also proven to be pretty shock resistant as it has been dropped several times and banged on walls - all by accident as we move through the day with luggage and a young child.Now, with all of the nice things said about this camera (I am not technical nor a photography expert so I cannot give specific details on more advanced features), this camera is NOT water proof.  My husband has taken it kayaking, so it did get splashed on and it had no problems but either did our last non-waterproof camera with this activity.  The problem happened last month when we decided to take it snorkeling.  Well, it was in about 6 inches of water (since we were still getting positioned) and it took 3 pictures (which did survive) and it died - black screened on us.  We thought okay, it needs to dry out and get some rest, as if it had a hard day and needed some time to reflect on how to go forward. Well, letting our little blue camera rest and dry out did not help it.  It was utterly and totally dead!!We called the warranty department and got a very nice young lady to help us with the procedure on returning the camera for repairs.  We sent the camera to them by priority mail and one week later the status online said that they had not received it.  We called them again and they said it was there probably but they have a BACKLOG of this particular camera so they will get to it as soon as possible.  This was a huge red flag for us and one that I wish would have been in bold letters on the product page!!  :)  The helpful people, which they were every time we contacted them, called us three days later and left a message saying that they could not repair the camera and they were sending us a replacement.Our camera got water in the lens, the flash, and the battery case - it smelled burnt and took two days for the lens to dry out.  It was toast.I would have gladly given this camera 1 star but I feel as though since the company stood behind their product then they deserve my 3 star rating.  With that said though, we will not use this camera in water again.  I would not recommend this product for its intended use of being water proof/resistant and it is too expensive for a point and click camera since you can get the basic features on far less expensive models.

The first morning there, I woke to a hubbub of activity, whale sharks had been seen close to shore. I grabbed the camera and within moments had taken a shot of my lifetime of my girlfriend hitching a ride with a huge whale shark! The underwater shot was beautiful. Although I admit there had been a moment of panic of putting the camera under water, there was nothing to fear.Since then I have taken beautiful shots in the rain, and in a rain forest in Hawaii. I never worry if it will make it through. Note though, I FOLLOW the DIRECTIONS for the procedures to be waterproof. If you don't, the camera will flood, as would specialized waterproof cases costing thousands of dollars!!!The camera is now the only camera I normally carry unless I need my DSLR. Of course, with the DSLR, I also need to carry my Garmin 60 and run all the pictures through GPS tagging software (all my photos are geotagged).This is a great P&S.; And also, it's waterproof (to 40 feet, optional 120ft case), has GPS, and is very rugged.

Based on the manufacturer specifications, I think this one has the best water-proofing capacity compared to other water-proof, shock proof cameras currently on the market.  Essentially, this would be a perfect camera if you are not too terribly picky on the picture quality, and would like to take pictures WHEREVER you go, no matter what the environment may be throwing at you.  The following is my 2 cents on the camera:Pros:-Water-proof depth (40 ft/12 meters), shock and freeze proof, and has a very ruggedly-built look.-GPS (which is a good and bad thing, but definitely handy in Picasa if you want to remember where you've been in the world.)-Great outdoor pictures, and full-HD video with auto focus/zooming function when shooting.-Various modes for different photo-shooting conditions.  For the most part, using the iA (Intelligent Auto) mode will suffice.-Leica lens is always great.Cons:-Slow response from GPS (indoor, mostly) When outdoor, the GPS seems to pick up quickly (firmware version 1.2 would help.  It drains the battery as well, so you might want to use Airplane mode to reduce battery drain even when the camera is off.  The latest firmware can be found here:[...]-Indoor picture isn't as good. (OK, but not great)-I wish they had a len cover when the camera is off.Overall, I am really happy with the purchase, and although I haven't officially taken pictures during scuba dives, a bunch of pictures in my bath tub showed that the water-proofing is working so far.

The USB did not work. Amazon shipped a replacement and it arrived the same day (two days later) that I was able to get the old one shipped! Works perfectly. Downloading pictures is easy to iPhoto but video has to be downloaded to iMovie and that takes longer than our other camera (iPhoto takes care of both pictures and video with that one).I have already used it under water in the local YMCA pool and it worked great, both pictures and video. The quality was much better than the $10 disposables. We have taken it to the zoo and a couple of Fairs. I was never concerned about dirt, moisture or getting it knocked. It has worked as expected in all conditions.Remember that it's not a $1000 camera and that there are limitations to the rugged design. Its picture quality is no better than a camera half its price. It's bulkier and a little heavier than most digital cameras; but nothing that causes problems. You are limited with distance with the flash. Remember the limitations and there are no problems.The GPS is a little slow locating itself. Recommendation: Take a minute whenever you arrive somewhere to get the GPS set asap. Don't wait until you want to take a picture! The battery has lasted about a day of regular use and the GPS permanently on.

It is difficult to get crisp shots unless you are outdoors in bright light.  Even then, when you review the pictures you shot, if you zoom in on any of them, they quickly get blurry.  It's like even though it's 12.1 MP, it's really not much better than a 3 MP camera, because you can't zoom in to take advantage of the quality anyways.  Indoor/low light performance of this camera is terrible.This camera was a letdown, but we ended up keeping it for vacations and wet use anyways.  For normal shooting, we wanted something better, so we bought a newer model (at the time) Canon, the SX230HS.  That camera is awesome - the shot quality and low light performance is really good.I also generally like Canon's menus and UI much better.

The optical zoom was a little less than best in class, but not much.I had this camera for 15 months and used it underwater about 15 times, taking around 1200 photos while snorkeling, sailing and kayaking. Almost all of the photos were taken within 6ft depth. I was generally happy with most of the raw photos it took, and very pleased with how they looked after editing in Lightroom. Limitations I found were with focusing - a lot of pictures were slightly off when I zoomed in; and dynamic range - a tendency for bleaching out the bright areas. Performance on land was OK but nothing special. I think the TZ1 trumps it for low light every time.The GPS feature is, frankly, a waste of money. Not very accurate when it does work, which is sporadically.The movie quality is ok, but the sound is awful.And now the real con to this camera: reliability. The first week I had it, I lost all of my photos because it corrupted the memory card. And yes, the card was fine and functional before I used it in this camera.Now if you're reading this review before buying this model or its successor with the same basic body design: beware.

I carefully inspected the seal and found nothing, no nicks, cuts, foreign matter etc. Sent back to Panasonic and they replaced the motherboard and seal.  Was able to take pictures out of the water just fine for a year after i got it back.Outdoor pictures are ok. Not as good as my Pentax K-7 and I didn't expect them to be.

I took it on the trip, and although I was nervous about actually using it under water, it worked great, and I got some fabulous pics of stingrays and conch shells! I was totally impressed that a poor photographer like myself could get such great quality shots! I think it's not only the technology within the camera, but also the Leica lens; my photos look professional. I have also taken videos with the camera, and they have also come out fantastic, although the HD recordings make huge files (400MB for a 2.5 minute video). I highly recommend this camera, but suggest that you compare prices before buying, 'cause I've noticed that the cost is all over the board; some of the price differences seem to be based upon the color of the camera, which makes no sense to me at all, but I found the best price on the blue case.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great underwater pics but did not last", "Author": "C.

It worked very well and feel the pics and video underwater was better than expected.  The shots were clear and got pics of nemo and great memories.  It also took decent pictures during daylight but less than average quality at night.  After the Australia trip, I only used the camera above water and sporadically light.  Last month, I traveled  to the tropics and took the camera to the beach.  To my surprise water got inside the camera and it shut down for good.  I think the camera lid may not have snapped in all the way but it appeared to be closed with the extra security switch. Either that or the seal failed.  In hindsight, the locking mechanism is a serious flaw on this camera.  I really love the ability to take pictures underwater, so picked up a good deal on the equivalent Nikon camera (AW100).  I quickly noted that the locking mechanism on the Nikon is far superior and full proof relative to the Panasonic.  While I have not tested the Nikon underwater, I did get it wet and encountered no problems.  But I can tell you that above water it is far superior in picture quality and particularly using the scene settings.  It also does great at night, where the Panasonic did a poor job.  At any rate, while the Ts3 now is an old and replaced camera, i think the locking mechanism of the latest model has not changed.

There were very few reviews at the time so I purchased the camera mostly on faith.I recieved it just prior to our departure,and used it extensively on land and in the water.By the end of the trip , the camera was no longer functioning - black screen - even though I had followed all of the immersion and post immersion procedures to a T.Upon returning home, I had to send it to Texas for repairs and didn't see it again for 3 months.While the camera was working, I took underwater vids, and still photos, on land and in the water. In my opinion, the photos were very good in bright sunlight, and mediocre to poor indoors, or in any kind of low lighting. The underwater videos were good as long as there was ample sunlight and we weren't too deep.Compared to the Sony Bloggie that one of our travel partner's brought along, the land videos weren't in the same league - the bloggie took much more vivid videos with less lense flare, and other weird abberations that the Lumix experienced, depending on the angle of the sun.All in all,I am very disappointed with the camera. I have an old Fuji finepix 3.5 megapixel camera and a Canon A630 8MP that take much better pictures, and land videos than the lumix.

That means I need a good point-and-shoot camera that will survive constant rough treatment while I am scrambling around on roofs taking tons of pictures -- rain or shine.I am very pleased to say that after about a year of daily use my Orange DMC-TS3 has held up to this task perfectly.  I work with the camera in my tool belt where it is constantly jostled around, often dirty, and occasionally wet.  Sometimes I accidentally drop it.  In spite of my best efforts to break the thing, it continues to operate perfectly, with absolutely no problems whatsoever.I am not a sophisticated camera user, but I appreciate all the work others have done to help demonstrate the very good photo and video quality.  (All those camera-techie reviews are what helped me decide to purchase this camera over the close competition.)  When taking pictures, I most often simply use the \"intelligent\" auto-everything point and shoot functions.  With the work that I do, I need hundreds of high-quality pictures that display good details, but when I'm working (up on a steep roof) I don't want to have to think about how to take a good picture.  Thankfully my DMC-TS3 delivers this over and over and over.I also use the camera recreationally.  I recently took the camera to the local high-speed go-cart track, and was able to shoot pretty good pictures and HD video while driving.  About twice a month I take the camera swimming, and my family loves the underwater pictures.  My young children especially like having their pictures taken while splashing around.  Even when snorkeling in the murky light at depths of 25+ feet, the pictures are much better than I would have expected. There's a handy pre-programed 'underwater' mode that makes this easy.  Again, the DMC-TS3 consistently delivers excellent pictures every time, without me needing to excessively fiddle with the settings.I found a nice, perfect fitting, shock-protective silicone jacket for the camera, which significantly helps protect the camera.Bought here on Amazon, LINK:http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006OQY550/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag;=foodrene-20&linkCode;=as2&camp;=217145&creative;=399373&creativeASIN;=0892968192The silicone jacket does not help the waterproofness at all, but I believe that it provides a huge improvement by making the wet camera easier to grip while protecting the camera from drops, etc.  After a year of use the snazzy orange housing remains in like-new condition, even after a number of big drops -- a few of these drops happened while I moving fast (running, biking, etc), where the camera fell and then scuttled and tumbled along the asphalt for a compelling distance.  To my amazement (wearing the silicone jacket) there is no apparent damage to the camera.I also have experimented with a wireless Eye-Fi card in this camera, \"Eye-Fi Pro X2 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Wireless Flash Memory Card.\"Bought here on Amazon, LINK:http://www.amazon.com/Eye-Fi-Class-Wireless-Memory-EYE-FI-8PC/dp/B002UT42UI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1339002848&sr;=8-1While it works reasonably well, and the Wi-Fi functionality from the camera certainly was novel, I suspect that the DMC-TS3's high-quality metal housing might hinder the strength of the Eye-Fi's signal.  The card seems to work better in some of my other more plasticy devices (mobile scanner, etc).  My experience was that the Eye-fi card was pretty slow in this camera (around 15-25 seconds per picture).  When working, I usually am transferring around 100+ full resolution photos at a time, often doing this several times a day.  I now use a 'class-10' 16GB card, and I find it much faster to just remove the SD card and manually transfer the camera's data directly to my computer.  While I ended up deciding to not use the Eye-Fi card in the camera professionally, it remains a pretty cool gadget.  I am more inclined to use the Eye-Fi card while at the beach or while swimming -- places where I do not want to open the camera for fear of contaminating with water or sand....All in all, I am extremely happy with my Panasonic DMC-TS3.  Arguably there may (or may not) be other similar cameras out there which deliver slightly better performance in one catagory or another.

The battery doesn't last as long as i would like, but I've only cycled it a few times, probably will carry a spare for those longer trips through Thailand.Image quality is average, compared to my Nikon. The image stabilization feature makes a big difference. I find the image quality drops a bit when I use the zoom. I relied upon the review at dpreview.com for this camera.

In the several weeks that I have owned it, it has been everything I wanted and more.The camera is rugged and beats just about all the competition in terms of underwater depth it can achieve and drop height. Never will I be snorkeling past 40 feet and if I decide to do any scuba diving, a housing is clearly what I will need. So this camera is perfect for the water enthusiast.The quality of the pictures is great, crisp, clear, and with great colors. I have noticed that it is a little slow to focus, especially while taking videos, but I have not found this to be a major issue.Other great features: the designated video button is awesome, making videos SO easy to capture. The playback is pretty easy and shows the photos nicely. Video playback drains the battery pretty fast, but it still lasts several hours.The GPS isn't really great and is, in my opinion, a rather useless feature since none of the data transfers with the photos. A nifty gimmick is all. The 3D picture is also a nifty feature, but not very useful unless you have a 3D TV that can playback (which I do not).Overall, I would say that this is an excellent camera to buy.

A few months after this review I was taking mine between 30' - 40' deep regularly while scuba diving in the Red Sea. It never leaked and I'm still using the camera daily in my job as a park ranger. I just keep it strapped to my utility belt and never worry about the downpours or cold it's subjected to. These are some amazing cameras!After extensively researching all the \"tough\" cameras out there, we decided on two DMC-TS3's to travel around the world with last summer. We'd been using a Fuji XP50 for our \"adventure\" shots, and while it survived the abuses we subjected it to the photos were usually really awful. Review after review put the TS3 on top, so we ordered ours here on Amazon for a lot less than we saw them being sold for elsewhere. Then we hit the road with them, subjecting the poor things to multiple falls of 3' or more onto concrete or tile floors (and a sidewalk once), daily snorkeling trips in several oceans at depths of up to about 20', countless pools, rain storms, near-constant humidity, and our own coin or shell-filled pockets with no protective cases. After 7 months of this abuse and some 9,000 photos later (each) both of us still having perfect-working cameras with nothing more than cosmetic blemishes from drops and light scratches on the display screens. Bottom line: these cameras rock if you're traveling.We never seem to miss any shots; just pull out the camera, turn it on, and it's ready to go in about a second. The shots aren't up to the level of quality of say, a Canon Powershot Elph series, but an Elph would've been destroyed with the first grain of sand that got into its retractable lens on a beach. Or inevitably dropped. Been there...not fun. That's one thing that sets the Lumix apart from the others: no moving parts. The similar Olympus and Sony models both have lens covers that retract into the body when they're turned on, meaning sand can get in there. The lockable access cover to the battery and card reader slots is accident-proof, unlike the one on the bottom of our old Fuji which could be opened underwater with a wrong movement. I've read the stories on here of people's TS3's getting water in them (sometimes on the first use) but we haven't had any problems with that in 7 months. I chalk that up to carefully doing just what the camera (rather annoyingly) says to do anytime the case has been opened: make sure there's no sand on the access door after you've been in the water or on the beach. It's that simple. Like the manual says, run the camera under fresh water when you get out of the sea, then allow it to dry before opening the case. Use the little included brush to get the little grains out and viola: nothing's gonna get in there...not even water. We usually shower ours off when we're showering the salt off ourselves.The GPS is a little hit and miss; it works much faster on one camera than the other but the battery tends to die faster on that camera. That said, the battery still lasts all day when taking 200+ shots. The compass is accurate, the altimeter jumps around with variations of several hundred feet, and I've never used to barometer function. For taking travel pics in every kind of environment imaginable, though - they're perfect. Panasonic makes a scuba case that allows much deeper movement, as well as a $5 rubber skin to keep the scuffs at bay when dropped. I think everyone else had covered the technical aspects better than I can; it shoots fast, auto-shot works well usually, timed shots come out well, and the preset shot selectors seem to work great when shooting in the environment it's made for. Honestly, I usually just keep mine on \"auto\" all the time and like the results. These cameras really live up to the \"tough\" moniker, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy one again in a second should mine get stolen or something.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "not bad at all... not the greatest", "Author": "Petr Marecek \"glados\"", "ReviewID": "R22CQJI3CH2PGR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a replacement for my stolen Sony Cybershot camera. I have 2 kids so I was looking for something rugged they drop and step on and that I can take to the beach and shoot them playing in rain splashing mud around. As far as ruggedness goes, it's been exposed to all of the above and held up pretty well (6 months in) as I took good \"aftercare\" described in the manual.The picture quality is average. It doesn't have a lens cover so if you take one picture in rain and a drop dries off on your lens and you don't wipe it off and go on a weekend trip, you'll have 50 smeared pictures. In low light, it's kind of grainy and the flash is not the most powerful. And the video in low light is just sub par. The video is otherwise decent but the width of capture is not quite as wide unless you're standing at a good distance. Underwater looks pretty good. The zoom buttons are somewhat awkward, definitely preferred the zoom \"lever circle\" on the Cybershot.Battery life is average. Size is not the super compact but not too big. Looks are great.It is slow. Sometimes it takes 3+ seconds before taking another picture with flash on. And from off position to start shooting a video easily takes 5 seconds which with 2 hyper kids makes you sometimes miss the best action shots.Overall, not a bad camera.

I wanted water proof and ruggedized mainly so the camera would last and could be taken out in bad weather, rafting, and sailing etc. with out worring.  I haven't had a chance to really put this camera to the test but side by side shots with my FX07 show a definet improvement in pics and video dispite the lower max aperature of F3.3 vs. my old camera's telescoping optics with F2.8.  I was skeptical about the folded optics and lower max aperature but somehow it just takes in more light.  The camera is a bit bigger than my FX07 but I will just have to live with that.  I looked at the Sony TX10 very closely due to it's smaller size and came back to panasonic because of their features and intuitive menu design.  Another reason the I went with the panasonic is because video starts instantly when you start recordings where the sony takes 4-6 seconds to start recording video.

Does survive 5 foot falls--we had a toddler and so the camera has taken a few spills already :( .Photo quality is poor given the price. Our four-year old, $149 camera takes pictures that are much sharper with more accurate color. The TS3 cannot deal with even moderate dynamic range in a shot--darker areas are noisy. If the shot is dim overall, the entire image will be rather noisy. And all fine details, regardless of light intensity, such as blades of grass, distant tree leaves, even the striped pattern of bluejeans, get blurred into a patch of solid color. It is amazing that a $300 camera gets away with this!GPS is impressive if you wait long enough for it to determine the location.

It is replacing a Canon PowerShot A640 (which is a great camera) but I broke it by dropping it once too many times and getting it wet while I was fishing.The Lumix DMC-TS3 seems to be exactly what I was looking for.First, it is small enough to fit in a pocket in my fly fishing vest or the back of my cycling jersey. The Lumix is slim without being too slim or small for my hands. As a rule, I don't like custom battery packs but in this case, I think it keeps the camera small and slim (and I think most other cameras in this class have a similar battery). Some people commented on the Lumix being larger than they thought but for me, I wouldn't want it any smaller. It is just the right size.Second, it can take a dunking. I'm probably not going to take it underwater on purpose very much, but it's good to know that I can get it splashed and occasionally dunked and not ruin it. My Canon survived my dropping it in a river at least twice, but not the last time, and I'm sure this Panasonic wouldn't have a problem here! I guess a few people don't like that this camera doesn't float but I actually do. Since most of my time near water is on a river, the camera might float away from me if I dropped it and it was buoyant. I guess it would be different if I spent a lot of time on a boat, and in that case I might invest in a camera float for it. I also chose the orange color because I thought I would be able to spot it easiest in case it sank to the bottom of a river.Third, it is rugged. Yesterday was the first time I took the camera fishing and wouldn't you know, I dropped it! I didn't mean to, of course, but it happened. I was putting it in my back fly fishing vest pocket and I missed the pocket and it dropped from waist height onto some large boulders. Not only did it survive, but also not even a scratch! Awesome!Lastly, it has to have *decent* picture quality. I don't mean that it has to equal a DSLR (and anyone who thinks this tiny lens and sensor can come close to a DSLR is probably kidding themselves). I have only taken pictures one day, but I can say that the pictures are good enough for me. I had some challenging lighting conditions and some of the pictures had some overexposure, but I expect that with these scenes. You can see the pictures I took here:[...]These pictures were all taken with the normal default camera settings. I don't know if I had played around with some of the scene modes if that would have changed things. I did darken these photos a bit with Photoshop Elements, but other than that they are straight out of the camera. So, overall, I thought they were decent for what I was looking for. I'm sure I can tune the settings in the camera a bit to improve them even more. These were some of the very first pictures I have taken with the camera.As far as the buttons on the camera go, I think everything is where it should be. If I had a complaint at all, it would be that the menu/thumbwheel button location can be accidentally hit when I \"one-hand\" the camera. But I'm ok with it, anyway. I'm sure the more I use it, the less that will happen.I haven't tried any video modes or anything like that yet.All-in-all, I think it's a pretty good little camera that so far has met or exceeded my expectations!", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "DETAILED COMPARISON OF Panasonic TS3 to Sony TX10", "Author": "SammiMur", "ReviewID": "RE6RHXX3KTPUI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, some background on what I was looking for:  I'm a casual photographer.  I wanted a waterproof camera which would produce high-quality photos in all settings (indoor, outdoor, and underwater.  My intention was to completely replace my 7.2MP Sony DSC-W7, which I LOVE.  I wanted to add the underwater feature without compromising on other features.  I did not want to spend more than about $400 for everything (camera, two 8GB memory cards (Class 10), two extra batteries with charger, and float strap.  This left me with about $340 max to spend on the camera itself.  I do NOT know a lot about photography.  Terms like \"ISO\" and \"white balance\" are foreign to me.  I like to use pre-programmed scene modes and auto features.  I enjoy digital scrapbooking and I frequently zoom and crop.  It takes a very high quality photo to crop out/enlarge a small figure without too much distortion.I began my search online and spent about 6 hours researching the cameras in my price range.  The cameras I focused on most were the Canon D10, Sony TX10, Panasonic TS3 (sometimes referred to as FT3), Olympus TG-810, Olympus Tough 8010, Fujifilm XP30, and Pentax WG-1.I eliminated most of these options rather quickly based on their reviews, overall ratings, and the quality of photos that I reviewed.  I narrowed my focus to the Canon D10, the Sony TX10, and the Panasonic TS3.I wanted to love the Canon D10, since it seems to be the overwhelming fan favorite, but I ultimately decided that it wasn't going to be a good fit for me.  The price of the D10 is similar to the Sony and the Panasonic, but it's a 2.5 year old model which doesn't have HD video.  The photo quality seemed about equivalent to the other two, so I decided to only focus on the two models with HD video.I would have been completely sold on the Sony, since I've used only Sony cameras most of my adult life and I've never been disappointed in one; however, there were some notable deficiencies which most reviewers found with this model (detailed below), so I was a bit hesitant to take the plunge.  The Sony was also priced near the top of my budget ($329), whereas the Panasonic was only $275 at Amazon.com.  The Panasonic reviews seemed to all be very positive, with the only significantly commonly-noted problem being lower quality indoor photos.  However, all of the indoor, outdoor, and underwater photos that I reviewed online looked very good.I decided to take a chance on the Panasonic TS3 and I really, really, wanted to fall in love with it.  I ordered it from Amazon and they delivered it the next day.  I wasn't blown away by this camera.  The outdoor photos were good.  The video was very good.  The underwater photos (taken in my large fish tank) were very good.  The indoor photos were POOR.  I decided to order the Sony TX10, hoping that I'd see better results.  I ordered it from Amazon at 9pm that night and it was delivered at 1:00pm the next day (gotta love Amazon!).  The photo quality of the Sony camera is outstanding.  I'll be keeping the Sony TX10!!!  For some people, however, the Panasonic might be the better choice.First, I'll provide my overall recommendations, then I'll add in all of the detail:BUY THE SONY TX10 IF:You value the quality of the photos/video above all else.You like touch screen devices.You don't plan to dive lower than 16 feet.You don't care if you can't adjust your settings (other than zoom) underwater.You want a VERY small camera.You always use a wrist strap.BUY THE PANASONIC TS3 IF:You can live with grainy indoor photos.You don't typically enlarge your photos to 100% (because they will be distorted).You want a camera with GPS.You plan to dive deeper than 16 feet.You want a larger (but not too big) camera.You're looking for a less expensive option.NOW FOR MY DETAILED COMMENTS ON BOTH MODELS:PRICE - The Sony is +/- $50 more expensive than the Panasonic.SIZE - The Sony is significantly smaller and lighter than the Panasonic.  I don't think one is better than the other, per se.  It's a matter of personal preference.  The Sony will fit in most pockets.  The Panasonic probably wouldn't.RUGGEDNESS - Both cameras are rated very well in this area.  I haven't \"tested\" them, but it seems like the Panasonic is built a bit tougher and would be less likely to get destroyed in a fall.  Rather than test this feature, I'm going to just trust the experts that either one will hold up well if dropped.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great waterproof camera", "Author": "Summer ShutterBug", "ReviewID": "R2UH9IS6QI7LVW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been looking for a good waterproof camera for a long time to use on vacation.  The reasons I held off for so long were numerous, but this camera fits the bill.  Why did I choose this one over the others on the market (options which include a waterproof housing for my current point and shoot)?  What constitutes \"good\"? - waterproof up to 40 ft - full HD video recording in AVCHD format - fairly good pictures where there is sufficient light - uses SD cards.  16Gb cards are really inexpensive - acceptable price - bonus: GPS!Sure it's a pocket camera, so your expectations for picture quality should be set accordingly.  Additionally, since the lens does not extrude from the camera body when you zoom, should you really expect picture quality to be as good as non-ruggedized cameras where their lenses do extend outside the body?The catalyst for purchasing this camera was a recent trip to Hawaii.  Along with such trips the activities included lots of snorkeling.  Got good pics of the kids snorkeling as well as various sea creatures.  Also took video of our snorkeling trip with the manta rays, which took place at night.  Video was decent when the only light source were from lamps 30 yards away under water.

Additionally get the Olympus brand float strap thingy - I was confident that I would never lose the camera in the ocean with this strap attached.<rant>I really do wish manufacturers would standardize on chargers though.  I have so many gadgets, each with their own charger, that it's a ridiculous exercise to travel with them all (phone, iPad, Kindle, cameras, camcorders, etc).  But for now, what can I do?  Is it really that hard to get electronics manufacturers to use AC to USB adapters (with standard mini USB cables) across the board?  I won't ding Panasonic for not doing this now, but I do wish manufacturers would be brave enough to not have a different charger for each and every model they make (well, based on the battery).  This camera functions well for summer vacations, but it's charger is not.  It's difficult enough where airlines charge $25 for any luggage checked in.  Why did I check in my luggage?

I banged it around in the snorkel bag... getting in and out of the water, etc.  It worked and still works like a champ, easily portable and useable it fits in your pocket.A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS...  1.  if you are going to use it in the water get a 'float' strap.  2.  READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! AND Follow the instructions for soaking and cleaning before opening!  3.  LET IT DRY OUT BEFORE OPENING!  4. Bring some lens cleaner if you're going to use it around the beach...sunscreen inevitably gets on the lens.Can't wait to take it skiing this winter!", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Durable, versatile, and takes great pictures", "Author": "sarahfromky", "ReviewID": "R2QN52WQXR8TS2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this camera to take on occasions where my DSLR is inappropriate.

I enjoy photography but I am by no means a professional.I waited until I had adequately used the camera to do this review.  It's awesome! I took it on vacation to Florida.  The scene settings are great for me.  Basically all I want is a camera that will take great pictures during the day and at night indoor and out.  There is a great candlelight setting that I like for outside at night.  The beach setting is awesome, too.  I took it to the ocean and it took great photos and I didn't have to worry about it getting wet.  At Disney, I took some candids and it worked wonderfully.My main complaint with compact digital cameras is the shutter lag. After pressing the shutter release, it takes seconds to focus and then flashes a million times THEN takes the pictures. 99% of the time, the pictures are terrible. I would rather use disposable 35mm cameras. NOT THE CASE with this camera. Depending on the setting, it is as quick as my DSLR.  The settings are easy to change and work. With other cameras (cough SONY cough) the settings are essentially the same and the shutter lag is terrible.If you're looking for a camera that is durable, versatile, and takes great pictures this is it.

It takes great outdoor pictures, but indoor ones are sometimes not as great.  They are still very nice pictures but lack the crispness and vibrancy of the outdoor ones. I use the camera pretty much on \"automatic\" all the time.  It may be the way I am using it.  Either way, I still like the camera. it is my \"go to\" camera.  It boots incredible fast and has a very fast cycle time.  THE GPS function is next to useless. I just leave it off.A few things that sort of bug me with the camera are: 1. The USB cable appears to be propritary and expensive if you want a spare. (The HDMI cable is not). 2. When transferring pictures via the USB cable to a computer, the full display on the camera is lit up completely white.  This uses a GREAT DEAL of battery power.  I wish there was a means of turning it off or making it black during transfers. 3. The placement of the video microphone is such that when you hold the camera while recording, you almost ALWAYS cover it up with a finger or two.There is some kind of of provision where if you expect to take Panasonic up on their (waterproof/dustproof) warranty, you have to send the camer to them every year (or similar) and have them inspect and replace the seals. 1 person siad that this costs between $60 and $90.

I took it on a rubber boat trip down the Waccissa river, which is spring fed and pretty clear waters. I didn't even bother getting in the cold water- just turned the camera on video- and dropped it over the side of the boat (floaty attached- but not used) I held onto the camera strap so I could somewhat control the direction. After a few minutes pulled the camera up to see what was recorded.  I was amazed not only at all the fish and vegetation near the spring head, but the sounds we heard. It automatically focused on fish as they swam by. Captured some pretty awesome video without ever having to get wet. I let it dry as suggested, and our photos and videos came out great. Took it again to the Wakulla river and took one of their paid boat tours. Asked if it would be ok to drop it over the side of the boat as we were approaching a pod of manatees. Was given the ok, so we tied a piece of fishing line to the camera strap (boat sits higher so couldn't reach over to hold it over the side)- turned on video and over it went- unfortunately using the fishing line, I didn't have any control on which way the camera was facing and since we were still moving (very slowly) I think I got more video of the underside of the boat :(  Not the cameras fault though. Once again took it home and let it dry- and photos and videos are just fine. so far no problem with the seals, as mentioned by some others.

They agreed to mail the camera back to me.When I opened the box, I immediately pulled out the now-dead battery and inserted a charged one.  The camera started right up!  I went through the pictures on the memory before I lost it, and they were all intact!  Then I took a few pictures with the camera, and it worked perfectly!  I washed off the mud, inspected the camera, and found that after 6 months of being buried alive, frozen, carried in snow melt, and lying in mud, THE CAMERA STILL WORKS!  All functions I have tested operate as new.  The battery even holds a charge.  I am simply amazed that after all this little guy has been through, it continues to work perfectly.As other reviewers have remarked, it takes good pictures, but is not likely to replace the massive SLR's used for photographing magazine covers.  But I defy anyone to find a camera that can withstand more punishment without breaking.  Kudos also to the Brother labelmaker whose labels adhered to the case for the 6 month enduro so that the kindly person who found the camera would know whose it was, and thanks go to my good samaritan friend in Colorado for returning it to me.", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "Tink Thinks", "ReviewID": "RIQZY5QY04GCK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little camera has gone everywhere with me.

I've used it several times now in the Bahamas and Bermuda. I was also able to use it while scuba diving this year.I followed the instructions meticulously about preparing the camera for use underwater, and for cleaning when out of the water. I've had no problems with leaks and it's been over a year.The \"intelligent auto\" setting of the camera did fairly well. It recognized when I was photographing a person and switched to portrait mode. It also switched to macro mode when doing a close up of a flower, and landscape mode while taking pictures of a small island from a boat.The camera has several other pre-set modes, including one for beach/snorkel, and a second for underwater. According to the manual, underwater mode is used when going deeper than 40 ft, with the use of an underwater housing. Beach/snorkel mode is used for depths less than that. I found that these modes do not work that way.Using snorkel mode while in a 4 foot pool of clear water in bright sunshine, the camera took very good pictures, both above and below the water. The video turned out very clear as well. However, during beach and reef snorkels, despite the bright sun, any pictures under the water have a very noticeable blue-green look, like they were taken through a cloud on turquoise gas. They are in focus, but the colors are washed out. I assume that the camera's mode is trying to adjust for the loss of light and the color shift as you go deeper, but even near the surface, the pictures were not very good. Out of the water (on the surface and in a boat), the pictures were fine and the colors were accurate.Switching to underwater mode made a huge difference. The camera still did well on the surface using the underwater mode, but the underwater photos were bright and clear. Both snorkeling, with the camera from inches to a few feet under the water, to scubaing, down to about 25 feet below the water, the photos were clear, sharp, and colorful. If you will using the camera under any water besides a swimming pool, I would recommend only using underwater mode.The largest liability of the camera is its LCD. While on land or the water's surface, it is easy to see the LCD, read all the icons to see the settings, and make any adjustments. Underwater it is a different story. The LCD becomes nearly useless when looking through a snorkel mask underwater. Holding the camera at half an arm's length, the LCD was only a light blob with no detail at all. If you held it right up to your face, you cold see it, but then you couldn't see around it. I wasn't always sure I had my subject fully in the photo. When zooming, it was nearly impossible the be sure what you were actually photographing. Even having the camera at a slight angle caused the subject to be partially out of the frame. Consequently, I used much less zoom than I wanted for many subjects.The camera is far from perfect. However, I don't want to spend the money for a waterproof housing for my DSLR. So, as a compromise, this is OK. If you are planning on using this more at the pool, on the beach, in a boat, or other areas where you want the safety of a rugged camera, this is a good choice. If you spend a lot of time in the water, this may not be the best choice. However, I don't know that there is a great choice in point and shoot underwater cameras right now. With the right settings, the pictures are good, but the limitations of the LCD are a barrier to many shots. Overall, I am happy I have this camera, but I will continue to look for a replacement.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Invaluable for every water-related vacation I go on!", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "R27SD266TVQO8Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera in early 2012, and I've brought it with me on every vacation I've gone on this year.

My friends and I love the day time photos I took with this camera while traveling in Europe last year. The clarity and color representation are excellent and it was a breeze to use. The night time photos are gorgeous when I was able to use the nighttime mode which takes 2-10 seconds and requires a stationary surface. The handheld nighttime shooting mode works pretty good but it can't compete with a DSLR nor does it work for motion shots such as during a boat/bus ride or when taking photos of moving objects. If only I could get a DSLR small enough to fit in my pocket with built-in GPS...While the GPS and compass make geotagging a piece of cake there was one huge problem with this feature. It seems that all of my photos are off by one GPS coordinate. For instance my first photo after landing in Paris was taken in the US apparently... Also, infuriatingly, they released a GPS precision update after my trip specifically tailored for Europe so some of my geo-tags are off by more than they should have been. The update could possibly have addressed my \"off-by-one\" issue as well if it's related to acquiring GPS locks but the details on the update are pretty vague.One issue many users of this camera will experience at some point is taking some photos after accidentally touching the lens cover with an errant finger, basically ruining the pictures. This is especially an issue because there is no viewfinder and the LCD isn't anywhere near the resolution of the pictures taken by this camera so it's very difficult to notice a smudge on the lens cover. However, due to how the lens is recessed into the casing of the camera I usually noticed when I did this before taking any pictures. 20 of my 3000 pictures had smudges on them and had to be deleted. Unfortunately I wanted to keep two of them.I did in fact try out the underwater feature a couple times while on the French Riviera and the camera got some water inside of it after my second trip to the beach. I followed all of the instructions provided with the camera except that I used a beach shower to clean it rather than calm water but Lumix provided warranty service for me anyways. What really sucked about this is that it occurred halfway through my trip and as a result the camera was sporadically resetting itself, especially under bright lighting conditions where this camera excels.If you're looking for an easy to use camera for taking daytime pictures that can survive your punishment you'd be lucky to find a better camera without spending way more money.", "Date": "July 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "I can't find little reason not to love this camera", "Author": "Carol A.

It doesn't really seem like the battery compartment closes tight enough to be waterproof, but as of yet I have not had any problems. I think the most important thing to remember with these cameras is to rinse the camera in fresh water after being in the ocean, the saltwater can damage the seal over time (or so I hear).

Waterproof up to 40 feet and if you plan on going further it is one of the few lower end models with a housing case that can take it over 100 feet (fuji and canon do not). This camera takes great photos you just have to understand the different modes, and it has so many different scene modes including airplane mode, firework mode, underwater mode, etc.Cons: battery life is short especially underwater (buy a second battery, preferably an extended life battery).

My other camera is a DSLR (Canon EOS), and I did not want to invest in the waterproof gear that is offered for something that I may not do regularly.  My research led me to the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS3 camera, and I have to say this camera exceeded all my expectations.This camera is packed full of features and is relatively easy to use.  I found myself simply toggling between the various canned modes depending on my needs.  The sunset mode, scenery mode, the auto mode, and of course the snorkeling mode.  Switching between each mode took 3-4 clicks of the navigation button and I was ready to shoot photos in a few second.  I recommend playing with each of these modes and taking sample shots to see what mode works best for your situation.While snorkeling, one of the best features of the camera (after setting it to snorkel mode) was the single record button.  Previous cameras I have seen always required the toggling of switches or menu options to get into record mode; this camera has a single button and when pressed starts recording video based off your current video settings.  I found this to be a great feature when I was underwater and saw a fish or turtle and had to act quickly to record.One downside to the buttons on the camera is that the power, shutter, and auto record are close together, and on occasion, I would accidentally turn off the camera instead of taking a snapshot or video.  In addition, if snorkeling during the day, with the sun refracting into the water, it was difficult to see the lcd screen on the back to enure you are aligned with your subject.  But by knowing where the sensor is on the camera, and a little practice, it was easy to shoot video and pictures blind.The micro hdmi port is nice for connecting the camera to the big screen and reviewing your video and photos.  I do reccomend a 2nd battery.  While the battery life was decent, it is always nice to have a back up.  I got this one. Panasonic DMW-BCF10PP Battery for Select Lumix Cameras (Retail Packaging)Taking care of the camera is important as well.  After using it snorkeling, be sure to let it soak per the instruction manual to ensure all the salt and sand come off.The stills did tend to have a bit of a washed out look, but nothing that distracts you from the picture itself.  The sport mode and high speed shutter mode was fun to play with and I was able to capture some birds in mid flight.  By no stretch of the imagination could this camera replace a DSLR that allows you to adjust ISO and other camera settings to a granular level, but if you are looking for a camera that is light, portable, durable, waterproof with decent battery life (I went a full day with it on about 75% of the time).For sample video I took using the camera at Hanauma Bay on Oahu, follow this link:[...]", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camera, and more...", "Author": "Laguna", "ReviewID": "R30YKI1DP32LCY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my honey moon trip in Hawaii.

The camera worked very well for me. We took it snuba-diving (which I would highly recommend if you ever get the chance) and snorkeling to a depth of about 15-20 feet for a couple of hours. It took great underwater shots and was completely watertight. One thing, though... I did notice some vertical white lines on the LCD screen for brief moments while in a water park's lazy river, and actually sent the camera in for warranty service, thinking that it might be having a problem. The camera was determined to be in fine condition, and the repair technician sent a note stating that sun rays may produce the lines effect when pointed toward the sun. I will accept that this may have been the problem, as I did not notice any such issue when using the camera underwater or for routine picture-taking. I have recently learned that there is a silicone jacket available for this camera (actually recently discontinued, I understand) that I think will further add to the camera's durability, helping keep the battery/SD card compartment door switch from being tripped (I must confess that I did pay a good deal of attention to this switch when using it in the water, as this would be the main way for any internal water damage to occur, should the switch become tripped and allow the compartment door to open). The location of the battery/SD card compartment door is probably my biggest gripe about this camera, as it is located on the right side and falls underneath your right hand when holding the camera. My concern is that it could be tripped with even normal use, allowing internal water damage should the door seal become compromised during water use. This could be even further improved (in my opinion) by requiring a \"double-lock\" mechanism for the compartment door to minimize any such occurrence. I also recommend an extended warranty for such cameras (or any expensive electronic device, for that matter), such as can be purchased from SquareTrade. I have this coverage on cameras, netbooks, iPods, etc. It is very reasonably priced (much cheaper than through the product retailer) and usually provides better coverage.

However, low-light performance is just so-so; underwater, you have to either have bright sunlight above you, or be very good at holding still.  However, thanks to the uber-fast burst mode, you can usually take 3-5 shots and get one that's very clear, when at \"snorkeling\" depths.  (You have to delete a lot of blurry photos when you get home, but it's worth it for the excellent 1-in-5!)  But to be fair, we didn't have a lot of direct sunshine on our trip, which would have greatly mitigated this problem.We took this camera to southern Thailand for a week, and had a blast - took it on boat tours for 3 days, with tons of playing in the ocean, and played with in in the hotel pools, all without any problems.I thought that water on the lens (after emerging) would be an issue, and it sometimes is, but it ruined very few photos.  The globs are generally big, so you can see them in the viewfinder; if you see them, just dunk it again, and you're good to go.One annoying feature is that you can't just turn the flash on/off if you use burst mode.  It should silently disable burst mode when you turn the flash on, but instead, you have to go into the menus, turn off burst mode, THEN turn on flash mode, etc.  This is a bummer.  The camera's main drawback is its clunky UI, but it's survivable.Underwater, though, the flash makes for ultra-clear images.Battery life without flash was amazing.  I easily got ~700 shots a day, and never even got a low battery warning.The battery charger is another story.  Ridiculous design flaw here: when it's charging, a green LED is on.  When it's done, the LED goes off.  But if you see \"green\", you might easily think that means \"done\".  Oops!  Don't do that.  They really should have made the LED red, to avoid this confusion.The color balance on the camera isn't quite as nice as our Canon S95, but that's to be expected.  It's still very good though.  We brought both on the trip.IMPORTANT: For video, it has 2 modes: AVCHD and MJPEG.  I highly recommend AVCHD mode.  Further, I recommend using \"FSH\" (AVCHD at 1920x1080), since the lower-res AVCHD mode (1280x720) is lower resolution but the files come out at the exact same size, so there's no point.The three MJPEG modes all show very bad ghosting artifacts - like an old 80's camcorder - do not use them!  These modes should be completely removed from the camera, in my opinion; the videos are terrible.  Use the AVCHD modes (\"FSH\") instead.Overall, I am thrilled with this camera; it's super sturdy, well-built, and has a fantastic lens (although the zoom is weak, even in bright sunlight and above water).  I would highly recommend this as a 2nd camera, although due to the poor image quality when zoomed, and the not-stellar low-light performance, I wouldn't recommend it as a primary camera.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Linz", "ReviewID": "R31O4GE56P8HBJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely loved this camera.

Box arrived sealed and contains most accessories, including battery  and charger, but not memory card.  You will have to purchase one, however if you own another Panasonic camera of recent vintage (I do), its memory card most likely fits.  The battery is different in size that those of two other Panasonic cameras I owned.  It took only three hours to fully charge the battery..fairly quick.  It is not a true compact camera but is reasonably small and a little heavier than other cameras of this size..and for a reason..it is built to withstand shocks and water.If you own a Panasonic camera the controls are essentially the same and I did not have to read manual to quickly get started other than cautions about using in water and drops, etc.  Inserted battery and memory card and it powered up.  All functions worked.  As other have noted, having a button for still and movie is great, and the (the only negative for me so far) location of the lens is not ideal..your finger may wander over it if you are not careful.I bought the camera primarily for use underwater when I go to Hawaii in a few weeks and to Tahiti next year.  In the past I would buy throwaway underwater film cameras but those are now cumbersome and do not take great pictures.  As my first test on the first day of use I placed the camera six inches underwater in a sink for ten minutes.  No bubbles to suggest air is escaping from camera.  I turned on camera underwater and it worked.  I then took a video of me outside the water using the camera in the water.  I then looked at the film underwater and it showed me in great clarity.  I also took a few shots of me and these also were good.  I used macro underwater of the sink plug and it was sharp and color accurate.  Wide angle and telephoto worked.  I then removed camera and dried it with a micro cloth and it is now sitting on the cloth to drain and further dry.  I just checked it and it turns on after drying.  At least I proved I do not have to immediately send it back to Amazon for an exchange.I do not expect this camera to produce pictures as sharply or with color accuracy of my more expensive panasonic digital camera but those that I looked at on the lcd screen are very good for my use. I am not a professional and shoot travel pictures to print in Apple picture books.I also bought a Chums camera floater strap to have when I take the camera underwater.  As others have noted the cord used by Chums to attache to camera seems thin and weak.  I will have to strengthen that cord in some way before I use it.Final conclusion after several hours of use and inspection... I am very pleased.  I am giving it four stars because of lens location and I have not fully used it for an extended time period.

Nonetheless, SCORE.  I bought this camera because I wanted something that can deliver around water and other organics and not get all fugged up, and bought it based on a recent comparative review of waterproof cameras in dpreview.com.Second, I also own a Lumix DMC-LX5, and once you understand that camera's limitations and exploit its sweet spots, it delivers consistent professional quality across the board, quality that amazes this professional all the time.  I tell newbies that glass is everything: Lumixs have Leica, Sonys have Carl Zeiss, Olympuses have Zuiko, and Samsungs have Schneider. These are the big four global players in quality lens production.  Reviews that tout these four brands always point to the lens quality as being a big plus.As far as the TS3 goes, I pulled it out of the box, although high-impact plastic with some metal, build quality seems robust.  Inserted the battery and an SDHC card, turned it on, set the date, and presto was taking pictures instantly, then downloading them, before I had to stick the battery in the charger.  First results are very impressive: flash, outdoors, inside available light.  Very intuitive and simple menu, it even tells you how to take care of it before and after extreme conditions.  Fortunately you can turn this off.Going to an art show opening tonite, and will put it through its paces as a second camera to my Olympus E-3.If I could dock Amazon, they shipped through a carrier that only started service in CO on 9/1 (OnTrac) without so much as a peep.  Imagine my surprise when I went to OnTrac's website and it hadn't been updated (yet, it is now).  A little nervous about this at first, but all worked out well.  Their CS was very good, and camera arrived perfectly in an unmarked cargo van.  =)  Good job OnTrac!Anyway I will amend this review as I put this robust little Japanese-made waterproof wonder through its paces.

An amazing bargain for 12 megapixels, AVCHD lite full HD movies, GPS, barometer, altimeter, and compass. Did not mention the 3 d because that has got to be the most useless feature that cameras have adopted. Oh another thing I like is the scene modes are all the same as on my Panasonic Lumix ZS 7.

Less than a week before a trip to O'ahu it occurred to me that a waterproof camera might be in order.  I pored through dozens of reviews of different cameras.  I don't remember what it was that finally made me settle on this one, but  I do recall that there was nothing in any review that totally sold me.  When I made the selection, I was a little nervous because of the amount of money being spent.  All that being said, I'm thrilled with this purchase.  Originally I gave this product a four star rating, because I don't award five lightly.  However, I then rated the products attriutes individually and realized a four star overall would be silly when I gave five in each category.  At $300 on Amazon, this purchase was a bargain.  Ruggedness- while I haven't dropped it (yet!), it WILL happen and I love the fact that it'll take it.  My wife carries a Cannon Powershot in her purse and the screen cracked within the first month.  I guess the waterproof feature also factors in here.  I took this snorkeling and surfing.  Dove more than 10 feet down, plenty of wipe outs on the board- held up great.  I got a little worried while gleaning the owner's manual on the plane.  It showed a \"sold seperately\" waterproof case.  I panicked because at this point it's too late to get any other accessories.  Decided to just go for it and anxiously took it into the drink.  No problem.  I guess the case is for taking it below the 40 foot waterproof claim.  Ergonomics- one thing I do recall from other reviews was the nod given for individual snapshot and video start/stop button.  I also loved this feature.  It made taking pictures and video while treading water, diving and surfing extremely easy.  There was another review which knocked the zoom buttons on the rear face of the camera.  I disagree.  Just like the separate camera functions have dedicated, buttons, dedicated buttons rather than fumbling with a toggle switch for the operation make this camera quite easy to use while underwater or trying to keep your balance or stay afloat. I would agree with another's complaint regarding a the lack of a viewfinder.  Using the screen can be difficult in bright light, under water, etc.  However, this characteristic is not unique to this device and I'm so pleases with all of the other ergonomic aspects that I really feel a five star in this category is warranted.  Photo quality- Beautiful.  I also own a NikonD60 and can't tell a difference.  The underwater pictures were excellent- if the light was good- just like any other camera.  Shots taken on the beach were phenomenal.  Crisp & clear.  Quality of design- see ergonomics.  Value for money- the D60 was $800 when I bought it and I like this camera better.  You can't add attach a zoom lens to it, but for spontaneous snapshots and aquatic use, the Lumix is a great buy. At $300 on Amazon, it's an awesome deal.  I also love the geotagging.  Just put it on airplane mode and it'll turn off when you turn it off and won't kill your battery.  Which btw, battery life was great too.  I also got the Chum float and would recommend it.

The pictures taken were amazing.  I switched modes often (from normal to snorkeling) and found no difference in the quality of the photos.  It was great to be able to clearly see the view screen underwater.  I could even see the menus as I changed options underwater.  I purchased a floating wrist strap and let go of it while in shallow water.  It floated to the top with no problem so I would say this is a must.I noticed if I used two hands to take pictures underwater, I had a tendency to get a finger in the way due to the location of the lens.  I found taking photos with one hand was very easy and had no problems switching.If you use the GPS, be forewarned the GPS stays on even when the camera is off (camera prompts this to you) so it drains the battery fairly quickly.

So I'd like to think, a little thing such as a compact camera won't bring me down! HOWEVER, this camera, was 100% overly complicated.I had it for a week, read the book, cover to cover, and it was still too complicated. There were features this camera had on it's screen that weren't even discussed in the book. I got it to 'Ia' (intelligent auto) and could never get it back out of that, even after telling it to re-do all settings back to factory. You can't just change the settings on the fly. I was shooting in the bright sunlight, with snow.. and it was having a difficult time finding what to focus on. I could have probably changed the settings, but who has 20 minutes to go through the entire menu!There were a billion different features, that just werent needed, which took away the ease of point and shoot. The GPS feature was never right, even when I told it to go out and look for location again. It kept saying  \"location failed\".. i'ts a super heavy camera, so good luck finding a floatie strap to keep it from sinking.We have a Lumix regular camera, and the quality is superb, this one however, lacked that crisp sharp picture. This camera was a replacement for my Olympus tough that we'd had for several years(also waterproof, shock and freeze proof) I was looking for better quality underwater photos, and thought since our regular (Lumix) point and shoot camera is awesome, I'd go ahead and pay the high price and get a lumix for underwater, thinking, it would be worth the $$ for the lovely photos. Nope, not even close to the same quality.Now, here are a few more weird things. Each time you turn the camera on, it reminds you to check the door, makes sure to have you check that nothing is stuck in there. The entire book is a testament to WHAT NOT TO DO, with way of the sand, or water, and how to lock the door.. its even got its own little brush you are to bring with to sweep the door and seals!!The book also tells you that after one year, you need to replace the seals. (read somewhere they are at least $60) If you are in the water more than 60 minutes, it's underwater functions are no longer guaranteed, you are to take it out of the water, then within 60 minutes of coming out it has to be submerged in tap water, for at least 10 minutes. What type of person, buys a tough, freeze proof, water proof camera, and has this kind of time while on vacation? Oh gosh, I have to hurry out of the water, and hurry to someplace where I can submerge the camera for 10 minutes in tap water?! I don't know about you, but if I'm on vacation, I don't want to worry about how many minutes I am in the water, or how long its been since I submerged my camera, or where in the world the silly brush is to clean out my seals!! My Olympus which I had for years, never gave me any trouble, and I can assure you, it was in the water for more than 60 minutes, and never rinsed, brushed or submerged in tapwater!I bought the olympus tough once again instead, I should have known better. Why fix something that's not broken, and its by FAR easier and more user friendly to work.Returned this one today, and bought my trusty, easy to use, takes great pictures, light, Olympus tough 14 mp.Sorry Panasonic, you failed on this one.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lots of Features but GPS Not working Correctly", "Author": "L.

Panasonic's advertising led me to believe that it would include metadata like city, state, country, and maybe even special sites like Disneyland in each photo's image file. However, once you get your photos out of the camera, at least for Macs (I can't speak for PCs), the photos actually only include latitude and longitude data. I really don't need a $400 camera to only include latitude and longitude data along with each photo. Furthermore, about 25% of the time, this camera does not at all readily acquire GPS information; it might take an hour or more to do so.NONETHELESS, just regarding picture-taking, this Lumix DMC-TS3 is surprisingly good! For its price, it has a good zoom range, good resolution, good macro focus, and amazingly good low light level performance. I can't account for some owners' opinions that this camera performs poorly in low light. Our TS3 is far more light sensitive than our 8-year-old Canon G5, a high-end, 5 megapixel, digital compact camera.The TS3 is a little slow focusing and setting aperture and shutter speed. With the shutter button depressed half way, it needs about 2 seconds before actually taking the shot. The controls are outstanding. They are intuitive and the camera has just enough well-marked switches and knobs so that you don't often have to be mucking around in endless menus, especially several levels down in endless menus. I haven't tried its waterproof and physical ruggedness qualities, but it looks like it is sealed well enough.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worst Customer Service", "Author": "Michelle T \"Michelle\"", "ReviewID": "R3D62WSWGTF4RH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS3 from Amazon and did not realize until I had taken pictures of my daughter's birthday party that it did not come with the USB cable required to put those pictures on my computer.
