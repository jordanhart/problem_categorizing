I bought it, use it and love it, but I'm going to take a different approach here and review one aspect of this camera: the viewfinder.Most of the professional reviews I've found for the Sony a77 (dpreview, etc) are entirely missing the point.  The electronic viewfinder alone is reason enough to consider this camera a step up from a traditional DSLR, even if the DSLR you were comparing an a77 with had identical specs.  I'd say the a77's viewfinder is a pleasure to use (and it is), but even that is missing the point.This viewfinder will change the way you use your camera.  It'll change it for the better because it gives you greater control over the camera than you've ever had before.Because the viewfinder is an OLED video screen in the eyepiece instead of being a typical piece of glass, you're seeing something entirely different.  Something more useful.An optical viewfinder shows you what the lens is seeing.  An electronic viewfinder shows you what the sensor is doing.  Think about that for a moment.  Let's say you own a Nikon D7000 and you boost exposure compensation.  Do you see any change in the viewfinder?  Of course not.  You'll see that change in the photo you take.  That's how SLRs have always worked, even back in the days before digital.  Ah, but with the electronic viewfinder in a Sony a77, when you boost exposure compensation, you'll see the image in the viewfinder become brighter, just as the shot you take will be brighter.An even simpler example:  Look through the viewfinder of a DSLR and choose an exposure point.  Pick a dark spot.  Nothing changes in your viewfinder, right?  Pick a bright spot.  Do you see any change in the viewfinder?  Of course not.  But, in the a77 viewfinder, you see the exposure change because the viewfinder is showing you what the camera is doing rather than only showing you what the lens is seeing.Here's how most of us probably used our DSLRs:  You pick the camera up to your eye.  You look through the viewfinder to frame your shot, etc.  You take the shot and then pull the camera away from your eye so you can review the shot you just took, using the LCD screen on the back of your camera  \"Ah, shoot.  Blown highlights.\"  You lower exposure compensation, put the camera viewfinder to your eye, frame up the shot again and take it again.  Then check it again on the LCD screen on the back of the camera.In other words, it's a game of switching from viewfinder to LCD, LCD to viewfinder, etc etc etc.  Back and forth.With the electronic viewfinder in the Sony a77, you don't have to do that anymore.  You can literally see the changes you're making in the viewfinder.  And, better still, you can set up your viewfinder to review the shot you just took for 2 seconds (or 5, though I find 2 to be enough).  So, you take the shot and immediately see the shot you just took without moving the camera.This electronic viewfinder is an absolute pleasure to view, and it can do some amazing things.Want a level laid over the shot you're about to take?  Put it in your viewfinder.There's an excellent tele/crop feature in the a77 that drops the 24 megapixel sensor down to 12 and doubles the length of your lens' reach.  Thus, a 50mm lens becomes a 100mm lens, and you're seeing this change perfectly in the electronic viewfinder.There's also an option to check your focus.  Click a button and the viewfinder will show you a super-zoomed in view so you can check the precision of your focus.  There is absolutely no way this sort of thing can be done with an optical viewfinder.I've seen so many reviews talking about the weaknesses of electronic viewfinders in comparison to optical viewfinders, but they fail to mention the weaknesses of optical viewfinders.  Now that I've made the switch to an EVF, I'd really hate to have to switch back.  After using the viewfinder in this Sony a77 for a day or two, you'll realize just how limiting an old fashioned optical viewfinder really is.Specs only tell you what a camera is capable of, but as we all know, photography isn't about the camera.  It's about the photographer and the photo taken.  The viewfinder in this camera will give you, as a photographer, more control over your camera than you've ever known.  The buttons and dials give you control over the camera, but the EVF literally puts you inside the camera.  It's an awesome experience.  I suspect that, ten years from now, most DSLRs will have electronic viewfinders.I certainly wouldn't want to go back to an optical viewfinder after using this thing.  No way.UPDATE: Two years later, and I love shooting with my a77 more than I did when I wrote this review.  I also realize how much I didn't even mention, such as Focus Peaking, just to give one example.  Again, that sort of thing simply isn't possible with an old fashioned optical viewfinder.  Or how about the fact that this EVF is large and show 100% of the frame, whereas DSLR optical viewfinders only tend to show you most of the frame, though the edges aren't in view.  Details matter, right?  I want to see edge to edge of what will be in the shot.  I realize that the change from an OVF to an EVF is probably intimidating for some, just as the switch from film to digital was intimidating years ago.  It's change.  Digital isn't perfect, of course.  Some still prefer film.  That's fine if it works for them.  And an EVF isn't perfect.  Some will still prefer an OVF.  Again, that's fine if it works for them.  But for me, this camera with its electronic viewfinder is simply astounding.  It's two years later and I'm as excited about it now as I was when I bought it.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "A worthy successor to the A700", "Author": "D. Pierce \"pierce324\"", "ReviewID": "R1MSQLRKMEZKDD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Camera Fairy blessed my porch last Friday and handed me an Amazon box which upon opening, disgorged a familiar black and orange Alpha box with my A77 body inside, safely cushioned in bubble-wrap.  In addition to the charger, manuals and ads, software CD, neck strap and USB cable, there was an empty space (sadly) for the kit lens. Since I already own a very nice Minolta 28-75 f/2.8 standard zoom, I passed on ordering the A77 with the new 16-50 f/2.8 SSM \"kit\" lens. I put quotes around \"kit\" because the new 16-50 is anything but a standard starter lens. It has a constant f/2.8 maximum aperture, solid build and is weather-sealed to match the A77. Though not designated as a \"G\" or \"CZ\" lens, in tests it approaches the performance of Sony's excellent 24-70 f/2.8 Zeiss and is actually designed to fill the same effective focal length range on the APS-C cameras that the 24-70 does on full-frame. I planned on replacing my Minolta lens with the Zeiss next year but this new \"kit\" entry seems to be a serious alternative and since it is designed for the smaller APS-C sensor, manufacturing cost savings make it a heck of a bargain at half the price.Look and FeelIf you have never handled a pro or semi-pro camera body, the tactile difference between a polycarbonate and magnesium alloy shell is immediately noticeable. Even though the body only weighs a little over 1\u00bd lbs (without lens), it feels solid. It has a rubber grip that extends around the back on the right to cover the thumb rest area. The grip itself is deep and fits my medium-wide hands comfortably with a secure feel when holding it one-handed. The body is a little taller than the A700 but more rounded with a matte finish that gives it a no-nonsense appearance. I wouldn't base a camera purchase on how pretty it was, but I appreciate the look of a well-made tool whether it is a Kitchen-Ad mixer, a drill press or a tripod. The A77 is a well-made tool and that makes it pretty to me!It's What's Outside That CountsThe control layout is a bit different than the A700 but the main controls are similar enough that I was comfortable with it after only a few minutes of fiddling with them. Sony's Quick-Navi menu system from the A700 is gone but the replacement is not a step backward. All of the main functions except stabilization on/off can be accessed either with a dedicated button or on the LCD with a press of the function button.  the The stabilization on/off being relegated to the menu instead of having a dedicated button was surprising at first, but after thinking it over, I decided that I really never switched it off unless it was for one of the rare times I was using a tripod (or by accident) and all too often I forgot to turn It back on. Having it on by default and being able to set the menu to come on in the same position that you left it is a workable alternative to having a dedicated switch. One addition is the movie button. Yes, movie. The A77 is the first DSLR I've owned that can do movies and in addition to a full movie mode on the mode dial, there is a record-it-now movie button that lets you start a recording of that unexpected UFO encounter with your default settings at a moment's notice. Now I just have to remember that my DSLR takes movies!The LCD screen is the same size as the one on the A700 and has the same extremely high resolution but with improved brightness and contrast making it easier to see in bright light. Unlike the A700 the A77's LCD is articulated. Very articulated! The mechanism is very sturdy and can be tilted or swiveled into almost any forward, rearward or sideward position. It even allows you to flip the screen inward in the collapsed position for protection.The top of the body includes the aforementioned dedicated function buttons plus a monochrome LCD with it own dedicated backlight button that displays the basic camera settings at a glance. The selection on the mode dial is a little different from the ones on the A700. The multiple scene modes are replaced with a single scene mode position and the various modes are now chosen on the rear screen using the joystick control. The additional scene modes have been replaced with settings for Movie mode, 12 fps shooting mode, Sweep Panorama and 3D Sweep Panorama.The pop-up flash has a new mechanism that slides the flash forward and up to reduce the chance of the lens/shade blocking it. There is also a button to pop the flash up rather than the manual flip-up on earlier 7-series models. On top of the flash is another new thing for me...there's a microphone on my camera! Maybe I'll have to try this movie thing after all. The autofocus mode switch near the lens hasn't changed but the depth-of-field preview can now be programmed to show either depth of field or a preview of scene settings.Inside counts tooThe first \"inside\" part that I checked out was the viewfinder.  After reading all of the doomsaying from the fear, uncertainty and doubt threads on the forums followed by nearly unanimous praise from people who had actually used the camera, I had to see for myself.  I have had cameras with EVFs that were considered good. My Minolta D7i was hopelessly outclassed by the full VGA EVF on my Minolta A2 (yes, full VGA on a digicam bridge camera back in 2004!) and I was impressed by the A55 that I tried at a local store. About the new OLED viewfinder on the A77, all I can say is....wow! I imagine if you had 20-10 vision and were college-trained to pick flyspecks out of ground pepper, you might be able to see pixels in the image. I certainly can't. It's like looking at a good 17\" XVGA monitor from about 2'-3' away. The image is sharp and contrasty with nicely saturated color. The only clear reminder that it is an electronic image is in areas of very bright highlights or deep shadows where the dynamic range of the display cuts off before you eye would through an OVF. If you pan quickly, there is a faint fuzzing of vertical edges, but no serious degradation and no color tearing at all. Following a moving object is no more difficult than it was with my A700. As light gets lower the image grains up and gives you video noise sparkle which worsens as available light decreases. but still lets you see to compose down past where it would be practical or even possible with an OVF. Those are the basics. The initial plusses and minuses, so to speak. Now for the cool stuff! The list of add-ons in the menu includes options for showing all info (OCD mode), no info (just basic shooting info at the top and bottom), graphic mode (like the NEX LCD info display), Histogram overlay and electronic level. On top of any of these you can add a grid with a choice of a 4x6 square grid, rule of thirds or diagonal lines. The real value is something I missed when I went from my Minolta A2 to the 7D DSLR, namely that the viewfinder can be set to display exactly what the sensor is set to capture. This is really helpful when you are working in mixed light or mixed shade where auto white balance will often fail. Too blue? You see it. A little green from fluorescents? You see it. You can tweak settings until it is corrected and check the results in real-time. Another plus is that you can review the image for critical focus or exposure directly in the viewfinder in the brightest light and see it perfectly.  Speaking of critical focus... Most of the better DSLRs can magnify the live-view image for critical focus, but in the field it is often difficult to see clearly. Being able to look through the viewfinder and see a magnified image centered on any point in the frame is a real winner. Another great tool is focus peaking. This is a tool used in videography to highlight the parts of the frame that have the highest contrast (sharpest focus) so the cameraman can quickly determine where the focal point is while filming. What it does is create a colored halo (choice of red, yellow or white) on the edges of objects in the in-focus area that is very easy to see even if you are looking at a washed out LCD with the camera at an angle that makes using the viewfinder difficult or impossible. My bottom line? The A77 EVF exceeded my expectations. It offers a razor-sharp image that displays a larger, brighter view than any APS-C camera (the A700 is one of the best) and nearly as good as the full frame cameras. It also has some technological tricks up its sleeve that are more than marketing gimmicks and offer real functional value.Deeper InsideReally deep inside is a somewhat controversial Exmor sensor. It is 24MP which is far and away the highest pixel count of any APS-C camera on the market today. Why controversial? If you have been following the build-up to the release of the A77 and the initial reviews, you have surely seen endless threads on whether Sony should have put so many pixels on an APS-C sensor or spent their efforts on making a lower pixel-count sensor with stellar high-ISO performance. There are also thousands of images with accompanying text declaring its image quality is anywhere from better than medium-format to worse than a cheap compact. In truth, it is neither. Rather it is an advancement in sensor technology that trades some high-ISO performance for some pretty remarkable low-ISO resolution. It also makes a couple of steps ahead in color accuracy and dynamic range.I am not one to snap a photo and peer endlessly at each pixel blown up to 100% on my monitor, searching for something to b1tch about. I prefer to look at the images as I expect to display them and determine if they will look good. So far, the A77 looks good. Real good.Tools to Get Those ImagesIn the past, having \"special\" modes on a DSLR other than P-A-S-M (Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority and Manual) was pooh-poohed as a sure indicator of an entry-level camera that catered to photographers without a clear understanding of basic settings. Though this sounds a little snotty, it was generally true with helper modes like \"Sunsets\", \"Sports\" and \"Landscapes\" to preset the beginner's camera for best-bet shutter and aperture combinations for those subjects. I always thought that some of the more advanced cameras might benefit from some presets that would quickly get you near the optimal settings or add functionality that would be hard to set up manually. As I mentioned earlier, the A700 had a selection \"special\" settings on the mode dial for just that purpose and after checking them out when I got it, I never actually used any of them. That may change with the A77. While diving into the scene mode menu on the A77, it earned guaranteed return visits when it revealed a hidden gem in the Hand-Held Twilight mode. This first appeared on the higher end Sony compacts and is quite a useful feature. It fires off a series of shots in rapid succession then matches and stacks them to reduce noise and enhance detail in low-light situations. Image stacking has been available in Photoshop and other dedicated programs for years, but having it done for you in-camera is pretty cool. Some of the other features that have migrated from the compacts to the NEX and now to the DSLRs are Auto HDR and Sweep Panorama. The Auto HDR is similar to the Auto Bracket feature found on many DSLRs to trigger a series of exposures with ascending values to be used to create an HDR (High Dynamic Range) image. Auto HDR goes one step farther by actually combining and processing the images in the camera. Maybe not as \"pro\" as sitting in front of a computer and processing/tweaking the files in expensive software for an hour to get a natural-looking dynamic range enhancement, but Easy and Good trumps Hard and A Tiny Bit Better any day. If you want to do more than natural and create HDR art, the auto-bracketing covers up to a 6 EV span and there is always manual. The list goes on...ShootingQuite simply...I like it!It is solid, well-balanced, easy to grip and has a control set that grows familiar very quickly. I originally chose the A700 for its control ergonomics and the A77 may end up being a bit better! There's the huge, bright viewfinder and an acrobatic LCD that makes low, high and odd angle shots easier than ever before.The fastest autofocus I have ever had the pleasure to use and it is accurate too. If one of my lenses back- or front-focuses, there is a menu to compensate with micro adjustments that registers and saves the adjustments for up to 30 lenses. Technological assist for critical manual focusing is very useful.Fully metered, focus tracking continuous shooting at up to 8 fps is probably more than I will ever need and if it isn't, the more restricted 12 fps mode should cover it.Image quality is pretty amazing. I haven't tried out the RAW files yet but the JPEGs are quite good. If they improve the JPEG engine with firmware like they did with the A700, I may never use RAW.And then there is the movie mode...up to 28mbs 1080p60 recording with full-time autofocus or manual focus assisted with peaking...The features and combination of features fills a 240 page manual and rather than plod through them here ad nauseum, I'm going to go enjoy the rush of photographic inspiration that always comes with a shiny new tool!Down The Rabbit Hole...?Is the SLT design with a high-quality electronic viewfinder the wave of the future? Maybe, maybe not. There is personal preference and user inertia involved as with any major change. Remember, it wasn't until digital capture surpassed the film in working quality the it was widely accepted by working photographers and it took years after that to pry film out of some of those cold, dead cameras. The usability of the A77 viewfinder certainly has captured my interest and the interest of a lot of people that would have (and did) scoff at the idea.Is 24MP too much for APS-C? Some would say yes and I might have been one of them. Certainly the high-ISO performance would have been improved with fewer and larger pixels but for print sizes up to 12x18, the ISO 6400 images are pretty darn good and that places it at least two stops better than the A700 even with double the pixels. At ISO 100 to 400 in good light (which covers portraits and most landscapes) the level of detail is truly amazing and rivals the current crop of full-frame cameras. If you add the improved dynamic range and better color fidelity I might still say that 24MP is too much, but with a lot less conviction than before.I hope this answered a few questions, I will add more images and perhaps some comments as I get more familiar with my new friend.Happy shooting!", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "REVIEW of the new SONY SLT-A77|SONY 16-50 2.8 LENS", "Author": "Michael G.

We shoot a lot of photos so we change out bodies every 3-4 months so we don't run the shutter count too high and ruin the resale. We shoot 250,000-300,000 photos a year currently. Sony has fixed the bug that made me have to keep rebooting my first camera, as a matter of fact we've had zero camera problems since the first 3-4 bodies. We believe that this is the perfect camera for what we do and will continue to use them until they are no longer available. After trying several point and shoot zoom cameras we also settled in on a Sony HX-50. It is an excellent 24-1200MM 20MP camera with excellent video. I use ours for all of our video needs exclusively :DUPDATE 12-11-11Last week we put our 2 SONY SLT-A77s through the ultimate test.We were the official photographers on the Rock Legends Cruise and shot over 9,000 excellent photos over 3 days. I had to only reboot my A77 3 times but my wife did not have to reboot hers at all.We shot about 65% of the concert photos with no flash in low natural stage light and got amazing results with very little ISO noise problems.We also shot our 1st and 2nd rock videos with the A77 and were amazed at the results. I was set up about 15 feet from the main PA system right stack and the sound was not blown out even though I only used the on-board microphone. The stereo sound is crystal clear and other than some faint wind that was picked up the audio was perfect!We've received hundreds of compliments on our concert photos and many are from Canon and Nikon users :D They have already been published on several online rock magazines and there are a lot more to come :DORIGINAL POST:We were going to preorder one of these SONY A77s here on Amazon but my wife and I don't have enough patience ... plus we didn't want to risk the initial shipment from Sony being sold out before it arrives in the US... so we ordered 1 from a Hong Kong E seller Sunday night and received it this morning (Wednesday). (only $1329 delivered!)Wooohooo!It's quite a bit bigger (than our A55s) but it's not too big for my wife's normal sized female hands. It's a lot heavier (than our A55s) but not too heavy for her to use(she's our top WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER). She's been shooting 5 straight hours with it now with 3 different lenses.The new SONY A77 looks absolutely awesome! Sony has put all the buttons for everything nicely placed right on the body. There is very little need to go to the menu. The manual seems very comprehensive and since we already had 3 A55s it was very easy for us to breeze through and just highlight the new stuff.As far as photo quality if you are upgrading from an A55 we didn't expect too much more than the size/definition you gain with a 50% increase in MPs. We were wrong, the photos are phenomenal! If you are upgrading from another camera brand you will be stunned! My recommendation to all you Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Olympus, and Fuji users...  If you are thinking about upgrading your outfit, DO IT! Sell everything you have and grab one of these revolutionary new cameras and some legendary MINOLTA LENSES, or the SONY 16-50, \"G\" Lenses, or Carl Zeiss lenses. You will be opening up a whole new world of photography excellence!The 1st 25 quick photos we shot with an APO Minny 100-300 look excellent on our 42\" TV!Update 10-14-11We have now shot almost 5,000 great photos including 2 weddings. The 2nd wedding we shot was outdoors on a dreary, gray, rainy day and the photos came out fantastic. As a matter of fact they were so good that we sold our last 2 SONY A55s and ordered another SONY A77 with the 16-50 2.8 LENS which will arrive Wednesday-Thursday next week.We shot the 1st 5,000 shots with version 1.02 and experienced none of the issues that others have seen. We updated to version 1.03 yesterday, but since we had no issues we really don't have a comparison.Update 10-24-11We now are the proud owners of 2 of these beauties plus the new SONY 16-50 2.8 lens. The camera and lens go together like peanut butter and jelly! They are so fast together that the finished photo has appeared on the screen before the subject has finished saying \"cheese\"!We have shot our 3rd wedding, our 1st with good lighting. The photos that we took were nothing less than stunning. We are off today to shoot our 2nd engagement session and we are both like kids on Christmas Eve with every new opportunity to shoot. This camera grows on you every day and even though we have had the 1st one almost a month it is still exciting to use.UPDATE 10-31-11We have now taken over 6,000 excellent photos with our 2 SONY SLT-A77s. So far zero problems with either camera. We went out yesterday and shot with a handful of MINOLTA lenses and they all performed wonderfully on the A77s! We also now had the opportunity to shoot a few hundred shots with some of the new in-camera special effects. The color extraction is amazing, and you'll really like the pop and vivid as well!If you google our company name you will find our site with hands on reviews and photo samples under the SONY|MINOLTA tab of both the camera and lens.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "How refreshing can you get?", "Author": "C.

Of course, if you are already bogged down with another manufacturer's lenses and kit, you'll almost certainly disagree.......we understand and sympathise!Let us look at a few facts and leave nefarious comment to the bitter and twisted.1. This camera does not have a big flappy mirror assembly....thank you,God...even my digital Hasselblad cannot negate the appalling vibrations from its mirror (and there is actually a dedicated program in the software to delay shutter activation by 50, 100, 200 ms...or whatever to cover the failing up). Yuk.2. The A77 does have a super electronic viewfinder that even when wearing complex prescription specs,copes superbly.And you actually see what you are taking ALL the time. I have been using this sort of viewfinder for over ten years and always have preferred it to my Hasselblad....and optical viewfinders don't come much better than Hasselblad's.3.The frame rate at 12fps is magical.....no one else comes near.4. The image stabilisation is in the body...thank you again God...so even the G lenses are good value. The standard range is almost cheap!5. As STANDARD the camera does 12fps, sweep panorama, video, HD,and 3D and GPS. No fuss, it's all there.6. The artificial horizon feature,,,,as well as yaw sensing...is absolutely great. Who needs spirit levels now?7. There is a HUGE, yes HUGE, supply of Minolta lenses stacked up on eBay and elsewhere, that make experimenting with this camera a real joy.....instead of seeking a mortgage everytime you decide to try a new lens combination!8. AND....AND, this thing has over 24 Mpixels of sheer resolution.....cropping has never been such fun!9. The body is a metal casting and is sealed against a goodly level of water intrusion.....tough as old boots, if my 10 year old predecessor is anything to go by.10. It costs far less then you might think too. Buy the body and try some of the 'giveaway' used lenses before you commit to your final choice.Do try the 18-250mm superzoom.All in all, an exciting major step forward.Go and enjoy it!", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "NEW TECHNOLOGY", "Author": "Amer Bedi", "ReviewID": "R2MIXXSJCCZ364", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to shoot wedding video's because of it's superior focusing system. I shot several stills as well, and found that the images equalled or exceeded the quality of images shot with my Canon 5D MKII with L Series lenses. The only department this camera falls short in is it's limited capacity to shoot in low light. It will still focus very well in low light, but the images/video become very grainy. Images are equal to or slightly better than 5D MKII at 100 ISO and stay really good till about 800 ISO. After 800 ISO image quality starts degrading slowly till 1600 ISO which is the last usable ISO setting with acceptable results. The camera does have an option to shoot high quality pictures at even 6400 ISO, but the render time is very long. But it is great to have this option. Because of the extensive electronics, there is a lot of drain on the battery, so a spare battery is a must if you shoot professionally. Sony's 'Steady shot' is definately superior and more affective than Canon's 'Image stabalizer' and Nikon's 'Vibration reduction' technology. The electronic OLED True Viewfinder is amazingly accurate and can be switched off to work as a conventional viewfinder. The built in special effects are very interesting and a real Bonus. Everytime I pick up the camera and hit the FN button, I discover someting new. This camera has by far exceeded my expectations, and is priced reasonably.

I hate it! I love it! I hate it!", "Author": "Hatter", "ReviewID": "R2VTKMZ0XTPTR1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as an upgrade for my Sony A700 (badly dated) and this camera is a very good, but too long delayed, replacement for the A700.I do wildlife photography and sports photography as hobbies, so this review will only touch on those uses.  I absolutely love the improvement I have gotten in my wildlife pictures.  The focusing is faster and sharper, the colors seem more true, and the transition from 12MP to 24MP makes a tremendous difference in my ability to crop images (most animals still refuse to walk up to me) and still have a quality photo.  There is a night/day difference between the quality of pictures I take with this camera and pictures I took with the A700.I am disappointed with this camera's usefulness for sports.  The quality of pictures I obtain is either excellent or worthless.  Some reviewers love the electronic viewfinder and it does give you a better idea of how the camera sensor is \"seeing\" the scene.  However it is slow when following rapid sports action, and the viewfinder stutters (i.e. it shows still shots of previous pictures or just shows a black screen for a fraction of a second) when taking a continuous series of pictures.  This is very frustrating when I am trying to follow an athlete who is chasing a ball.  It is very difficult to keep a player in focus if I cannot see them and do not know exactly where they are.  The manufacturer is justifiably proud of offering a camera that can shoot 12 frames per second (only in aperture priority mode) and I really wanted that level of capture speed to allow me to get better pictures of bats meeting balls etc..  The only time you need 12 fps is when you are photographing a rapidly moving object, which is the time you will not be able to consistently see that object in the viewfinder:(The \"Sports Mode\" is unusable in my opinion.  You cannot employ spot focus in Sports Mode, and consequently the camera tries to average the focus between the athlete you are trying to photograph and all the players, officials, coaches, birds, stands, water coolers, etc., that you do not want to focus on.  It is not that difficult to employ manual settings, but why would you make a camera with a Sports Mode that assumes everything you can see is equally interesting to you?I love that I am getting great images and am able to get some shots I could not get before.  I hate that I am missing some shots that used to be much easier to obtain.

The EVF is a joy to use, the camera handles very well and is easy to use. I love the fact that what you see with the EVF is what you get on the photo.So far, of the couple of thousand shots - its performance is great... Love the focus peaking (shows you what is in focus with a hi-light color) - its great for tweaking the focus.I have not used the focus tracking for sports yet, but my tests (with a dog) show that it seems to work pretty well - I will leave others better qualified to answer that usage.Pros:Resolution !!!Nice interface (most of the options are really close to hand - and because of the EVF you don't even have to take your eye away from the viewfinder.That EVF !!Focus peeking and zoom functions allow you to nail the focus.Cons:Its not quite as good at handling noise at very high ISO (aka VERY low light) as say the Nikon D7000.The focus square confirmation can be a bit hard to see sometimes.. It really should be configurable.All in all =  I highly recommend this camera.

My skepticism was based on 3 things: 1) the image quality of 24mps on a \"C\" sensor (lots of mps on a small sensor); 2) the quality of the OLED viewfinder; 3) the buffers ability to keep up with the speed of the camera in RAW and 12fps.My concerns were put to rest when I tested the camera and saw the results.1) With the high quality Sony and Tamron lenses I use, the 24mps makes the images extremely sharp and crisp without any noticeable edge distortion. WOW! Just amazing quality.2) The OLED does take some getting use to and can become very pixelated in low light with the \"Live View Display - Setting Effects is ON\" but the advantages of what it can do when setting the proper exposure, shutter speed etc so that \"what you see in the OLED viewfinder is exactly what you get on the card\" has changed the way I shoot for the better.  When using the camera with my studio lights in Manual mode, I Turn OFF the Live View Display in the menu and OLED operates like a DSLR with all the settings in complete manual mode without any pixelation in the OLED viewfinder or Live View Display.3) The buffer speed when shooting in RAW or in the 12fps mode is not an issue WHEN YOU use a SD 92mb/s card. Slower cards work but you sacrifice buffer performance in RAW and at 12fps. Turn off the image preview in the menu. Image preview really overworks the buffer especially at 12fps. As you get use to using the OLED, you will find you won't need to be constantly previewing the images you just took because \"what you see in the OLED is what you get\".Now for the fun stuff the camera can do: 1) in camera panorama mode; 2) digital 1.4 and 2.x zoom; 3) what I call Super Auto mode for the times when you are just shooting snap shots of family, things etc.; 4) and my favorite is the \"Picture Mode\"- with HDR Paint mode, b/w monotone, b/w spot color, soft focus, toy camera, etc.Conclusion:  I am very impressed with the a77.

Griffin", "ReviewID": "RWFKD8ZSAYP3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I made the switch from Canon to Sony about five years ago with the release of the Sony a350.  Wanting to move to a more feature rich DSLR I did extensive research and liked what I saw regarding Sony and the direction they were going.  After acquiring Konica Minolta's photography technology, it didn't take long for Sony to start making an impact.  They seemed to be on the cutting edge of research and DSLR technology (Sony released the 1st really useful Live View technology).  My research was confirmed when I went to a well know photography chain to look at the newest Canon and the salesperson directed me toward the Sony line.  After doing a side-by- side comparison of features and image quality, I made the jump to Sony and have not regretted it one little bit!I finally got lucky and caught the a77 in stock at a very popular NY photo supply store and had it in my hands in TX just three days after I placed the order!  I have been shooting with it for a couple of weeks.  There was a slight learning curve as the a77 is quite an upgrade from my a350.  Simply put, this is the best camera I have ever used.  It was nice that it came with the newest firmware already installed (1.04).  After reading some reviews I was a little concerned about the EVF but am truly amazed at Sony's implementation of the new technology.  It is bright (even in sunlight), big and extremely helpful at obtaining the correct exposure (WYSIWYG) and I don't have to take my glasses off to use the viewfinder.  Another really nice feature that I discovered, while attending a wedding, is the sheer quietness of this camera.  Two photographers were shooting the wedding (One with a Canon, the other with a Nikon) and it sounded like the paparazzi.  The shutter noise of the pros cameras was distracting while my a77 was extremely quiet.  Another cool feature is the \"Peaking Level\" menu option that is extremely useful while manually focusing the camera (for macro shots, etc.).  When you obtain focus the EVF or the back LCD draws color lines (red, white or yellow options) around the object you are shooting to verify focus.  Really cool and useful.If I have to find something to complain about regarding the a77 I have a few points.  One, the battery life could be longer.  It uses the same battery as my A350 (so I have some extras) but it would be nice if Sony would develop a longer lasting battery.  For some reason the GPS feature seems to suck battery life.  Two, there is no \"Steady Shot\" button on the camera body.  To use the camera on a tripod I have to go through the menu system to turn off \"Steady Shot.\"  Not a huge deal but a button/switch would have been nice.  That's it, no other negatives from my perspective.  There has been a lot of chatter about the noise in high ISO ranges from this camera but I have not found it to be an issue in real world use.  All cameras are going to be \"noisy\" in ISO 1600 and up.  This camera has so many useful features as well as many fun options; it's just not practical to discuss them in a short review.Just a note of caution. . .  if you are trying to make a decision about which camera to buy, keep in mind that not all reviews on the Sony DSLR/SLT cameras are unbiased.  As I was researching I found that many pro reviewers (photographers, tech. geeks, etc.) were heavily biased toward the equipment they use. There are also many unbiased reviews that point out the short comings of each of the camera models.  I recommend that you go to a photo store and see them for yourself and do your own side-by-side comparison.  If you have lens from Canon or Nikon it may not make since to switch.  But, Sony is on the cutting edge and the future looks bright for their technology.  I know I'm going to be very happy with my a77 and look forward to what is next.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best features and image quality for its class", "Author": "A. Pardo", "ReviewID": "R26CYMAUA0N3IT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Nikon D300s. The scores for the sensor of the A77 in DXOmark are slightly better than the D300s and slightly lower than the Nikon D7000 which has the same sensor as the Sony A55 and it's known to be the best in class so far. It's unfair to compare this camera with other models that are more expensive, so keep it real.So, in my mind, when I changed systems, these were the things I gained:* Full focusing during video* Option to shoot at 24MP (I still shoot at 12MP most of the time)* 12fps* Stabilized sensor, which means every lens I put will be stabilized* Superb electronic viewfinder, OLED with >2 million pixels!* Auto and Manual HDR, Auto and Manual DRO (Dynamic Range Optimizer)* And a whole bunch of features that for the first time I've used effectively...On top of all of these points, I highly recommend the bundle with the 16-50mm f/2.8 lens. They call it \"kit\" lens but it's definitely not. Just look at the specs: f/2.8 and weather sealed. And I can tell you the image quality it's way up there with the lenses in the $X,XXX range. It's only $600 extra to add it to the body price. Go for it!Cons:* The only cons I've found are that the JPEG processing in-camera seems to blur details a little more than Nikon or Canon. But still, for a 24MP sensor and to keep-up with current noise performance of competitors I think it's a major breakthrough and the images are very usable.You can safely shoot with plenty of details up to ISO1600 or even a little more, but don't expect to be using ISO12,800 all the time. RAW image data is much better, so if you have the time to edit your photos, shoot RAW.* The auto-focusing only works with the largest lens aperture of the lens you put in the camera, but it works decently.* If you shoot at 24MP all the time and especially RAW, you'll fill those memory cards quickly. My solution? I was happy with 12MP on the Nikon D300s, so I just adjust the setting on the A77 to shoot at 12MP and that's it. I still have the option of going 24MP if the situation needs it.Final word:Give Sony a chance, you won't regret it. If Canon or Nikon were to offer a camera with the specs of the A77 it would easily be in the $2,200 range. Just check the reviews online everywhere and you'll see how happy people are.

This allows me to absolutely control my shutter speed while compensating for low light by increasing aperture and when the lens runs out of F-stop pick up the remaining exposure compensation with an increase in ISO.  This will give the best exposure (as long as depth of field is not a consideration), by eliminating camera shake, freezing subject movement and adding only the absolutely necessary amount of induced ISO noise.  When shooting with the 16-50mm F2.8 lens in Shutter Priority and Auto ISO (or Multi-Frame Auto ISO) the software will NOT allow the lens to go below F4.0.  This means that as the light is decreased the camera will begin to increase the ISO at F4.0 and never go to F2.8.  So you've paid big bucks for a lens that opens to F2.8, carried its extra weight around and then can't open the lens more than F4.0(When shooting in shutter priority).The HDR and \"Multi-Frame-Iso Noise Reduction\" give excellent results.  However, when used, there is a significant post shooting processing time during which the camera is non-responsive.  The camera will not allow you shoot for about 7 seconds after HDR processing and 9 seconds after using Multi-Frame-Iso Noise Reduction. Just hold your breath and count to 9 as that lion opens wide and roars at the setting sun.With previous cameras, I preferred to show a 2 sec \"after review\" on the monitor screen.  I didn't always refer to it, but it was there if I needed it.  If you set the A77 to \"after review\" and you are looking through the viewfinder, you are blind for about 3 seconds.  (About a 1 second \"processing\" message and then 2 seconds of the past).  You can clear this with a tap on the shutter, but this is an extra step and if you are taking multiple images of the same scene, it is easy to become confused if you are looking at the past or present.  It would seem like a simple programming task to show the \"after review\" only on the monitor, and not in the viewfinder.Am I going to keep it?  Yes.

Yet it still remains one of the best sellers (like the Canon EOS 60D or Nikon D5200) in that it is a true pro-sumer bridge type camera system.  This product is not a professional's grade camera, nor is it a beginners-end DSLR/DSLT type product.  But what it does provide is a product that has an easy to use internal \"Camera Menu\" system with a host of easily selected settings, a variety of available Sony or third party Lenses to chose from, an articulating rear LCD, a top-of-Camera LCD for quick visual reference and selection of some of the more frequently utilized settings (ISO, Metering, Burst Shots Speed, type of Focusing, etc.), that is also lighted.  This model also provides very high quality live action (Movie) type image capturing.When Sony purchased the Minolta and Konica Camera companies some time ago, Sony was able to combine the engineering development power of these two previous established manufacturers, plus Sony's own engineering capabilities to continually bring many of the newest engineering innovations and enhancements into the consumers market for products such as this Alpha DSLT A77.  Other Sony DSLT Translucent Mirror Alpha products include: the A37, A55, A57, A65, and their newest model the A99 \"Full Frame\" professional grade camera.  Also, Sony's DSC-HX## family series of products for those who want a higher end Point & Shoot with high zoom capability have enabled outstanding results in products such as their:(HX9, HX20, HX30, HX50, HX200, HX300, etc.).The Sony DSLT Alpha Series with its Translucent Mirror technology has eliminated the \"reflexing\" mechanical mirror that all DSLR cameras otherwise have.  Thus the image you see through the A77's \"Electronic Viewfinder\" or \"Live View\" LCD is the same image you will capture for viewing or printing, and allows easy access to the Camera's (28.2mm diag.) APS-C Sensor itself if cleaning is needed.  Not having a mechanical moving mirror also eliminates wear from physical movement over time, and potential repairs.This Sony A77 and A99 are the only Alpha's that have a Magnesium Metal Frame underneath their plastic outer covering - thus this camera is no lightweight item to carry around, but it is strong and very solid.  You can, or may have already, read its \"detailed features and specifications\", thus this review is intended to help provide insight to the reader from a slightly different perspective.  It is a straight forward powerful well made camera that will fulfill all your user desires and needs.As an additional comment, I am NOT a professional photographer, just a retired person who is a hobby enthusiast level photographer who primarily takes Wildlife and Landscape photos, who also utilizes Canon and Nikon higher end P&S; and DSLR type products with various Lenses and Accessories (you know, the type of guy whose wife is ready to disown him because of being a Camera junkie).  But, the point herein is that nearly \"all\" of todays quality name brand camera products will perform nicely, some better than others under varying conditions, such as: (image color, image capturing speed, internal image processing under various lighting conditions) and ability to capture \"quality\" images under poor lighting being the most prevalent concern, with a host of other detailed techno pros & cons that professionals or more detailed enthusiasts consider when selecting and using a camera.There are of course numerous other brands of Camera products currently offered, and products from Canon, Nikon, Fuji, Olympus, and others may be the right brand and model offering for you.  However, this Sony A77 is an excellent choice for those desiring high quality equipment, yet do not need, or perhaps can not afford to have a professional grade very expensive product.

I also wanted something more sturdy and preferably weather resistant. I've seen this camera listed as an entry-level 35mm, which it is not. I've seen it listed as a professional, which it is not. It really bridges the entry-level to the professional, with the functionality of what I would consider to be a professional category camera. I know many pros use this with fantastic results, especially if they have better lenses. After all, the lens is 80% of the picture (my guess anyway).I very quickly ruled out getting a Nikon or Canon. You pay extra for the name and when I played around with friend's Nikons (3100, 5100, and 7100) I was really not impressed at all. They took decent pictures but the cameras felt light (except the 7100) and, honestly, cheap. When I began comparing the Sony A65/77 with Nikons and Canons, it quickly became obvious that there were many more features in the Sony's and Pentax cameras!So ultimately I was trying to decide between the Pentax K30 and the Sony A65. After researching the two I then was looking at the K-5 and K-5ii, again comparing that to the A65. Let me say that I believe that the K30 is the far better deal for the price!  If you're looking to spend under $600 to get an outstanding weather-sealed camera AND lens, then the K30 is for you. It is, however, very much an entry-level camera and will not grow with you. There is no jack for an external microphone and a few other little things, that, for me, added up. For most it would be fine.So my expectations grew from the ~$600 range to about $900-1000. So I compared the K-5 to the Sony A65. For me it was pretty much a dead heat, with the K-5 slightly outperforming the A65, especially as it is a weather-sealed camera. After a LOT of online research and examining the differences between the A65 and their weather-sealed A77, I found the A77 to really be far above the \"entry level\" A65. You go online and look at some reviews and you'll quickly see that the A77 is a pro camera for a relatively cheap, entry level price.Some of the features that sold me:1.  weather-sealed body (now I opted for the non-weather-sealed 18-135 mm lens. I didn't know it wasn't weather-sealed when I got it though. I wrongly assumed that it was, but I don't regret it)2.  Magnesium alloy body (not plastic like most, even the canon and nikons, and the Sony A65)3.  24 megapixels4.  ability to shoot amazing, cinema-quality \"film\". Autofocus during video! Amazing!5.  OLED viewfinder. I was used to optical VFs, but when I tried this I was blown away. Immediate feedback on what the picture will look like. Totally sold on this technology6.  LENSES GALORE FOR CHEAP!!!!Let me explain this last one. First of all the \"kit\" lens that comes with it is weather-sealed. While I didn't get it I have read great reviews of this. I got the larger, 18-135 and let me tell you, this is a hell of a lens. This is a solid, heavy lens, not the cheap, lightweight lenses that are sold with high end Nikons, Canons, etc (I keep using Nikon and Canons as examples because, well, that is what everyone seems to feel they need to get)Second point about lenses. You can get any of the older Minolta AF (and even non AF) \"A\" mount lenses. Sony bought Minolta and kept the mount. So you can now go into a used camera store or on Ebay and pick up some OUTSTANDING lenses for a fraction of the cost of new Sony lenses. I got the 70-300 mm Sony lens as an add-on to the purchase for cheap on here (they had a deal). But if I didn't I could find this same Minolta lens (which apparently is exactly the same as the current Sony lens internally) for about $100. Seriously.  The fact that you can use Minolta A mount lenses AND Sony lenses is a major factor in my decision to go Sony over Pentax and the rest.7.  VERY QUIET AUTOFOCUS!!! Wow! I thought the lens was broken it was so quiet. You can find reviews of the Pentax K30 and Nikons and you'll hear how loud the autofocus is. The 18-135 is SO quiet! Good job, Sony.8. I also appreciated the way the menu system is set up on the Sony. For me it is a more common sense approach to setting your camera up. All options are listed on screen without having to scroll down ... you tab to the next screen to see the options listed. Much easier!9. Fantastic and LARGE sensor that surpasses most professional video cameras (this is a good thing for those of you who want to use this to shoot video.Things I don't like:1. non-standard \"hot shoe\" .  Jeeez.  Have to use Sony's proprietary flashes. They aren't too expensive, so no biggie for me2. The fold out LCD screen. Again, not that big a deal, but why not just fold the thing out to the side?!  If you put the camera on a tripod with a flash, then flip up the LCD to try to compose a self-timed pic, you can't do it. The tripod is in the way on the bottom and the flash is in the way at the top. Just dumb design on Sony's part. Stubborn.That's about it for now. Hope this helps you decide between some of the cameras above. I spent weeks researching.

Plunkett", "ReviewID": "R2TC57DVSEO3HN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, I love the viewfinder. It's not for everyone, and those well practiced with DSLR might see a lot of my reasons for liking it as amateurish, but the exposure and color I see in the viewfinder ends up being the exposure and color (white balance) I get in the picture. I don't have to constantly remember to check the preview and make sure I didn't blow it (and often I would forget to check that preview to find out I blew it later, with much disappointment). And there's a few setting for auto switching between the viewfinder and the screen that sometimes take 1/2 second to turn it on when I bring it to my eye, and it's taken me a bit to get through some initial confusion with it. Also, I can't seem to get the menu to work the way I want, with the viewfinder showing the live view, and the LCD panel showing my aperture, shutter, exposure, etc. (the way my older DSLR worked), but the top panel LCD helps with this.The autofocus is amazing.  Not only is it fast, but it's usually right on the target. Even with shallow DOF it usually zeros right in on the correct subject.  It does this in low light, even with a big lens. I realized today that it was able to snap right to my wife's face across the room with the 75-300mm Minolta beercan lens (the 30 year old first generation of AF lenses) while inside the house.  With the 16-50mm f2.8 it seems like it's just instant.On the \"fast\" mode, it's fast, taking shots quickly enough that it's hard to get just one. But it fills the buffer after only about 10 (or less) shots and then slows way down, even with some of the higher speed memory cards it tests one's patients waiting for the buffer to be free again.  It is great for a short burst though.The higher ISO settings are noisy. I can see the noise pretty plainly on a RAW image at ISO 800 with a 24 inch monitor. I've never had a higher end camera to compare it against, only some sample images on the web, but I can see the noise and have read many other's complaints. I can usually work around this with a fast lens or a flash, and have had some really great result with night shots using the multi frame noise reduction. There are limitations to each of these methods, but I've been able to make it work well for me.  When comparing it with previous camera, I realized that while the pictures got noisy, they were in focus, compared to my previous camera where the AF would fail in low light.It fits in my hand well (I've got big hands). I'm considering the extra battery / portait grip, but it's pretty comfortable without it, the controls are pretty easy to reach, and I'm beginning to get used to the top LCD screen enough to find it useful. Most or the buttons are well places and almost right under my fingers when I need them, but somehow never hit on accident.The on board flash doesn't fold back down that easily, and concerns me that I need to be careful with it, but it hasn't broken and might be more rugged that I give it credit for, but it needs to be pushed down at a particular angle back and down, not just down. And I have an external flash that I normally use anyways.The tilting on the LCD screen is way cool too.I think anyone upgrading from a point and shoot should immediately be comfortable with this camera. Those coming from a long time use of DSLRs might find the electronic viewfinder irritating, but should try it, maybe they'll like it after growing accustomed to it. Those shooting indoor sports or bats flying around in the dark, the high ISO performance just isn't there.

It allowed me to get my feet wet without breaking the bank. I learned alot about the basics of photography and lighting using it. I quickly upgraded from using the iAuto modes to Manual and eventually purchased an array of Minolta Rokkor lenses to compliment this amazing little device. I love the focus peaking and in most cases, find that manually focusing gave me much better results than autofocus. The only gripe that I had with the NEX was it's inability to use off-camera flash. Although the NEX cameras have amazing low light capabilities, I just love the strobists' style of photography.This is what lead me to purchase the A700 and some flash units. After using it, I began to prefer the handling of a larger DSLR vs the diminutive body of the NEX. It just feels a lot more intuitive for certain types of photography, especially portraiture and sports. Of course, the A700 also came with it's limitations...Live View with histogram to quickly determine the exposure of a scene, focus peaking and magnification for accurate manual focusing, articulating LCD screen which is REALLY useful for low angle shots. The OVF was nice, but it was not something that I was attached to like \"old school\" photogs. Bottom line, I really missed the conveniences I had with the NEX, but loved the \"professional\" features of the A700.Along came the A77. It offered everything I loved about the NEX and A700. The price point is a bit high, so I really had to crunch some numbers to justify the cost. I could've either purchased some more lenses and light modifiers or increased my budget to upgrade to the A77. I eventually decided that upgrading was something I'd most likely end up doing anyway. If the A77 didn't work out, I could always sell the body at a minimal loss (actually, between the high demand and limited supply, I could probably sell it at a profit in a month).I've finally received the camera after days of looking for online retailers that had it in stock (yay Amazon!) and after my initial round of testing, I feel that the high ratings from all of it's users are well deserved. I'm sure many of you have read enough about the A77 to know that it's no slouch, so there's really no need for me to reiterate what many have been saying about the technology.My personal opinion? I love being able quickly determinee my exposure in the viewfinder. As I stated previously, my experience with an OVF is very limited, so I don't miss it at all. Focus peaking is great for fine tuning a scene. The body itself is very comfortable to hold, sexy as well as rugged. Very similar to the A700 in some aspects, but slightly improved (not really sure how to describe it). It's a pricey camera, but I see it as an investment. I've been approached by family and friends to shoot portraits and upcoming events next year, but I have no plans to become a professional photographer. Of course, a paid gig here and there doesn't hurt.If you're in a similar situation and are still on the fence about purchasing it, go ahead and take the plunge. You won't be disappointed. For those that prefer OVF's, are not so enthusiastic about the new technology and features, or strictly CaNikon users with a large investment in lenses, you probably will not be as satisified with the camera as I am and most likely won't notice a huge difference switching.PS. I gave the camera a 4-star rating because of the price. It really is a bit expensive. I purchased the body for 1399.

As a confirmed Canon-lover (7D with a couple of 'L' lenses), I really didn't think Sony could bring much to the party. I've rarely been so happy to be wrong.  It is an excellent camera, especially when you ignore its many automatic modes and use it as a serious photographer.  I'll be spending a little more time in the weight room so that I can put the A77 in my camera pack alongside the Canon.My first impression was positive.  The camera is fairly large, but the body feels rigid and solid.  Buttons are placed and shaped so that you can make most choices while the camera is at your eye. The build quality of the lens is good--certainly not the rock-solid build of a Canon 'L', but not cheap. The strap is reasonably wide and strap connections feel solid.  Sony is proud of the OLED display and they should be.  It's beautifully detailed and saturated, and its articulation means that you can see it from many angles if that's the way you need to shoot.  I like the fact that it can be stored face-in.  You won't worry about it getting scratched from things rattling around in your camera bag.The first look through the viewfinder was more than a little odd, and I'm still getting used to it.  While it's a through-the-lens finder, it's not optical.  It's a digital display.  In a normal SLR, the light bounces off a mirror into the viewfinder.  The mirror swings out of the way as the shutter operates.  With the A77V, the mirror is barely reflective.  Only enough light to estimate the exposure bounces off the mirror.  It's not enough to form an image, so you get a digital version.  The good part is that it compensates for low light situations by brightening up (it's still kind of weird).  The bad part is that there's a small bit of lag--feels like a few tens of milliseconds--and a bit of moire patterning from densely-detailed situations.  This could be a small problem when shooting fast-moving sports.  I've often shot speed skaters from just a few feet away, and I really rely on my finder.  I'm not sure how this will work in that situation.  Guess I'll find out next time world cup is in town.Because the mirror doesn't move, Sony claims you can shoot at a very high rate of speed.  I was skeptical of this claim and with good reason.  There are several factors necessary for grabbing lots of shots in a short time span.  Of course the camera mechanism is a driving factor.  Then the camera's buffer memory, processor speed and card speed come into play.  Larger images require more memory and higher bandwidth in order to offload data to the card in time for the next shot.  As an example, my 7D will shoot about 15 RAW images in 2 seconds (the buffer's filled up then) and will then continue at a rate of about 3 frames/second until the card is filled or my finger gets tired.  You'll get higher sustained rates by shooting JPEGS.  Sony's mechanism allows you to grab a few shots at the claimed 15 FPS rate, but the buffering and card management are much slower than Canon.  If I shot 6 megapixel JPEGS, I could get a sustained rate of about 4 FPS.  With 24 MP JPEGS, that fell to a little under 2 FPS.  For RAW, the sustained rate was under 1 FPS.  For this test I was using type 10 SDHC cards--the fastest in the category.  This may reflect on Sony's choice of the SD card  instead of the faster CF card.The overall operation of the camera is very smooth.  The most critical choices appear both on the large display and on the viewfinder.  I can quickly choose metering and autofocus points, as well as exposure parameters, without taking my eye off the subject. This is well thought-out and allows quick decisions to be made without interrupting the flow of shooting.I've rarely expected much from a kit lens and typically buy only the camera body.  This one's a little different. The 16-50mm zoom that comes in this kit is quite a nice lens.  It's atypically wide for an APS-C type camera.  Couple that with a slightly larger sensor and a crop factor of 1.5 instead of 1.6, and you can get a pretty good chunk of real-estate in a single shot. The bokeh of this lens (out-of-focus appearance) is absolutely beautiful: on par with my 70-200mm F/2.8 Canon zoom.  That is high praise.  Focus distance can be very short.  You can easily get within a foot of your subject.  There's some barrel distortion (how could there not be) and a small amount of chromatic aberration.  That's partially corrected internally if you're shooting JPEG and it's also easily correctible in Photoshop.If you're shooting video, you'll be more than pleased.  I won't spend much time addressing it in this review, but I've found it smooth and sharp.  The ability to shoot at 60 FPS--progressive--is a bit of future-proofing.  Using VLC for playback, my Mac Pro found itself very busy simply trying to play it back.  The articulated main display earns its keep in video shooting.  The built-in stereo mic is quite good (Sony has long known how to make high quality inexpensive microphones).  It picks up a little camera noise, but it's still very useful, with a nice wide stereo field.I've seen a number of reviews which criticize the built-in noise-reduction.  That's true, up to a point, but it brings up the subject of the camera's internal processor.  If you keep in mind that an internal processor has to make decisions of noise-reduction vs. sharpening--all in the context of dynamic range reduction necessary to spit out a JPEG--you'll wonder how it does anything at all.  And that, in a nutshell, is why I don't bother with all of the camera's scene modes and other bells and whistles.  Sure, it's got panorama and pseudo 3D and psuedo tilt-shift, but I like to make those choices for myself.  I consider those to be point-and-shoot features that clutter up what is in fact a very nice camera.  I shoot almost exclusively RAW images, making those decisions later in Photoshop.  And this is the place where this camera has surprised me the most.  It's quite possible to throw in features to disguise what's really a mediocre product, much as you might overspice low-quality food.  I feared that would be the case with the A77.  But behind the gegaws is a really classy camera that can give you truly professional results.  Noise?  It's on a par with Canon.  Not really a problem up to ISO 800.  After that, it's what you get.  The excellent Photoshop Raw Converter can work wonders, but you have to consider why you need to be at ISO 6400. I've added a few shots to this review where I compare the camera's JPEG output to my own handling of the RAW data.  The reader can see why a little deferred gratification will give you a better result.Of course I have quibbles (if you catch me at the right time, I'll quibble about the Canon, too).  The management of the  SDHC card leaves a lot to be desired.  I use a card reader to get my images onto the computer and have found the data cluttered up with thumbnails and odd databases that should be stored elsewhere.  In general, the easiest thing is to reformat the card after offloading.  Sony could apply a little more thought to this aspect of use.  There's no way (at least that I've found) of embedding a copyright into the EXIF data of each shot.  Autofocus gets a little iffy in low light, etc, etc.Quibbles aside, this is a worthy camera.  For those moving up from a point-and-shoot, it might be a little too much camera.  A simpler DSLR might be a better gateway into the world of ISO, aperture, RAW and the like.  Those who know their way around a camera will be able to get solid results after just a few sessions. We'll have to see how this performs in the midrange market where Canon and Nikon dominate.

I have never owned a camera before but I knew that I wanted a camera that could take great pictures. I spent an obscene amount of time researching for 6 months while I was saving up for purchase. I also read two great books (Peterson and Northrup).I narrowed my choices to Nikon D7000, Canon 6D and the A77. I was concerned about the low light capability of the A77 and the ease of use for a beginner so I came very close to purchasing the 6D. I settled on the A77 and have used it for the past 2 weeks, about 300 pictures.I am overjoyed with this camera. I don't understand all the negativity that I've read about low light with this camera. I've taken great pictures in my house at night which is all I really need.The camera is equipped with so many buttons I have already learned how to work this camera manually. You rarely have to go into the menus, it really is incredibly easy. In manual my right forefinger is on the front wheel to control shutter speed,right thumb on rear wheel for aperture. While looking into viewfinder the screen gets lighter and darker as you adjust each wheel. When the exposure looks right snap the shot. The ISO button is just below the shutter button so u can adjust easily again seeing the screen change until it looks right. I learned how to shoot manually in one weekend so if anyone is concerned that this is too much camera for a beginner, don't be. It is very easy to learn and very user-friendly. I learned so much faster being able to see the adjustments live as I was making them.Set up was also easy. I followed Friedman's ebook chapter on \"my personal settings\". It took me about 2 hours to set everything up on every menu as he recommended.I purchased the 16-50 lens and it is incredible but larger and heavier than I expected but it won't leave the camera often. I also got the new 55-300 zoom for soccer games and wildlife. This lens is very small and light so I won't look like ESPN at my 8 year olds games. The image quality to my eyes is great. I'm very glad I didn't splurge on the G model of this lens.I wasn't too interested in the 12 fps at first but now it is my favorite part of this camera. I can get frozen shots in mid air without any skill whatsoever. Really cool.This camera is perfect even for a beginner and great bang for the buck.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great upgrade", "Author": "DocLunchbox \"XCV8404xcv\"", "ReviewID": "R2Y06K0CSAC9P4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this product as an upgrade from a Sony NEX 5r and have been greatly enjoying it so far. I actually did not order off Amazon but from the military NEX here in Italy, but since I frequent Amazon all the time I figured id write a quick review.The quality and feel of the camera are exactly in line with the listed price tag. All the dials and ports are well made and easy to open and close. The overall feel of the camera is exellent imo. It definetly helps that it is weather sealed as well as the weather in quite frankely any country your in can be unpredictible. With the NEX it didnt have many exterior mode buttons as the a77 has and found it difficult to nagavite the menu on the fly to get that once in a lifetime shot. The a77 is a much better option because most of the mode buttons are right there at a press of the finger tip. The bottons are also very synergistic with eachother.The EVF is absolutely wonderful, a game changer for me as others have said as well. Its so nice to look through it and be able to adjust the exposure in real time instead of taking a pic and seeing if it was under or overexposed. Essentially what you see is what you get.The back lcd if im not mistaken is the same reso as the NEX 5 so no gripes there. Very true to life colors and displays all the info on the shot that you are going to take just fine.The stock lense is great. It has heft and the zoom and focos rings are easy to manipulate. No jerking or anything of that nature. The in body stabilization is great when paired with the stock lense. When I zoom in to pixel peep or to crop an image its quite simply very sharp, imo a huge step up from my NEX.I am very happy with my purchase and will go Sony again in the future.Oh ya, one thing that I wanted to mention is the low light iso performance. So far ive had mixed results to tell you the truth. Sony has implemented a 3 shot burst at whatever Iso you choose and stiches them together while doing NR to create one final image which is pretty usable up to Iso 1600. Without that though, 1 shot at iso 800 is pretty noisy. Not unusable but definetly noticable.So I am very happy with my purchase, again the iso noise might be an issue for some but for me not really. 80 percent of my shooting is in the day anyways so im good. Dont do much video but from what ive seen is great. Please pardon any flaws in my techincal lingo and any misspelled words. Its 130am at work over here.

The A77 yields very sharp pictures even at 6 mp.  I have not taken any pictures at the maximum 24.3 mp yet.  I bought it to photograph my Huggmee chair and put it on the side of my van.  My little Sony Cybershot with 5 mp was just not enough.  With any camera, the quality of the picture is in the lens and the sensor. Everything else is toys. The kit lens is excellent, and the sensor yields pictures indistinguishable from a full screen.  The body of the camera is surprisingly light and small, compared to the professional models.  Unless you shoot at extreme lighting conditions without a flash, you will get excellent results.  Others complain about noise at low light but in the days of film, all high-speen films had grain too.  We know how to use flashes!If you do not want to spend $2,000 on the A77, you can get the same lens and CMOS on the A66.  Biggest difference between the two is the waterproof and dustproof body of the A77.  Taking 12 frames per second was achieved with the translucent mirror whereby we no longer have a mirror flapping up and down.I am glad I spent the time to read up on these cameras and that I bought the A77.  I have read some horror stories about bad customer service from all manufacturers but Sony seems to be the best of the lot.I hope this camera lasts me the rest of my life! (I'm 69.)

I am colorblind so gave up on photography when color took over.  But I know a quality photograph when I see one, and every shot from this camera so far, is a quality picture. The A77 at its price, makes Nikon and Canon look like scam artists.  The A77 is state-of-the art in dslr photography and can do some things and has some features that no other dslr has.

Once I got my hands on the A77 and realized the features it has, I realized I could sell both the A390 and Nex-5.  Sure, I'll miss the portability of the Nex-5, but sometimes you have to trade in your Miata for a Land Rover.  The electronic viewfinder is truly amazing.  Once you get a feel for where the buttons are on the camera, you can make adjustments on the fly without moving your eyes and you can actually see how your adjustments affect the picture.  It has some of the neat little features the Nex-5 has, video recording capability, panoramic and 3D panning, and creative modes, but it doesn't slouch on the features photographers want either.  You have to pay attention as the camera flat out flies and before you know it, you've filled up your memory card.  RAW + JPEG results in 30MB+ file sets per shot and since the electronic viewfinder allows you to adjust the shot on the fly, you take pictures a lot faster.  The 12 FPS burst is no joke.  I've checked timestamps and have a couple of bursts that were 12 per second.  You have to have a fast memory card though!

Out of all these cameras I love the a77 the most and have no intentions of ever selling it.  So why 3 stars you ask?  Two reasons:  ISO performance and lens selection.I took off one star for ISO performance because it is simply AWFUL.  Pictures of certain situations will display noticeable noise as low as ISO 100 and by ISO 400 you can see noise in pictures of any situation.  I have to admit that I've taken pictures at ISO 3200 that I actually like but it is rare.  In fact, I am very scared to ever take this camera above ISO 800 and do so only if it is absolutely necessary.  On my 60D I didn't even think about ISO until I got to 3200, so that's very disappointing.  It's especially disappointing because the ISO performance of the nex-5 and nex-5n are OUTSTANDING!  I would literally pay $500 to be able to put the 5n's sensor in the a77's body, there's that big of a difference.  The worst part about the noise that this camera produces is that it's simply ugly.  Canon and Nikon produce noise that could well be described as grainy.  In some situations, this noise can actually improve pictures by adding more of a film-look and a bit of character to a picture - not so with the noise from the a77.  I would describe the noise from this camera as splotchy and I have yet to see it improve one of my pictures.  So that is my first, and biggest, gripe with this camera.My second gripe is the lens selection/strategy for Sony's alpha lineup.  There are several things wrong with Sony's lens selection/strategy and if it's not fixed by the time I'm ready to get a new camera, I'm probably going back to Nikon.  The most obvious problem with Sony's alpha lenses is that they are ridiculously overpriced.  Comparing Sony's lenses to the Canon and Nikon equivalents, the Sony is almost always significantly more expensive (70-400 Canon-$1,600 Sony-$2,000, 24-70 f2.8 Canon-$1,200 Sony-$2,000, 70-300 Canon-$500 Sony-$1,00! - I could go on).  This would be ridiculous even if Sony's lenses were directly comparable to Canon's and Nikon's, because as the smaller player, Sony needs to be buying market share with reduced prices, not charging a premium for a brand that has no clout.  But the most ludicrous aspect of this problem is the fact that Canon's and Nikon's lenses offer much more than Sony's.  Every one of Canon's and Nikon's professional lenses are weather-sealed and most are stabilized.  The only one of Sony's lenses that is weather-sealed is the new 16-50 f2.8, and not one of them is stabilized.  So Sony is charging way more for their lenses which provide way less than the competitors - doesn't that bother anyone besides me?  It's especially upsetting because I remember back to when Sony bought Minolta and they were lauding the benefits of in-body stabilization, and they made such a big deal about the fact that the lenses would be cheaper because they wouldn't need stabilization.  That's just plain hypocrisy.Frankly I just don't like in-body stabilization.  I desperately wish that Sony would redo their entire strategy and move the stabilization to the lenses - I mean I'm already paying the same price for the lenses anyways!  It's also created another problem with the advent of the nex lineup because even though you can get autofocus with alpha lenses, you'll never be able to get stabilization - and that is a HUGE drawback.  That greatly reduces the usability of alpha lenses on nex bodies which is a shame because there are many situations where I wanted to use my nex with the alpha lens but couldn't because of this problem.Okay so those are the two significant things that I don't like about this camera.  There are other small niggles but nothing worth mentioning here.  Like I said before, I do love this camera and probably get a higher percentage of keepers out of it than any camera before.  However, that's only after realizing the troubles this camera has with noise and figuring out ways to work around it.That's all I have to say for now.  I'll try to post samples that show the noise that I'm talking about but it's hard because they're so small on Amazon.", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "that Was one hell of an upgrade", "Author": "Maher", "ReviewID": "R28QSXLS1X6VRZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "as a background I came from a 6 years long canon journey with 8 lenses and two flash guns, never wanted to go for full frames and never earned my life from photography, however photography is the second most important after my family. the review below is after 4 months of using the camera in almost all conditions.At a point i thought I'm giving up my canon 50D for the 60D, 70D or the legendary flagship 7D, out of the blue i came a cross the A77 (though I never thought before to change my canon gear even for Nikon's) and after some online research i decided to head to a Sony shop and test it and oh boy only if you believe in love at the first sight you would know how i felt, i have a real large hands but this baby just balance right the grip is fantastic and the build quality of the camera directly had me in. first time i put it against my eyes i LOVED the E-viewfinder, the idea of -what you see is what you get - that handy is amazing couldn't believe that i will kiss the test shots forever. only then i decided I'M getting it. the amount of details that this camera can handle in a single shot can't be compared with any crop sensor all over the market you name it. the sharpness and the color depth and temperature ISO performance all are just fantastic. i gave up my canon gear and now I'm building up my Sony's with 4 lenses and 1 flash gun so far.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "In the end, Sony a77 is the best total value (UPDATED)", "Author": "Chilehead Photography \"Captured Moments are t...", "ReviewID": "R1OLH7YCY5K2O0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll start by saying, that I have migrated up from a Sony point & shoot and the Sony NEX-5n, so I was already familiar with Sony menus and features.  Now when my decision to upgrade my camera came along, I really did consider switching due to all the chatter that says that you have to have a Canikon if you want to be serious about your photography.  For some reason, though, Canon just didn't appeal to me when comparing specs, so it was really down to Nikon and Sony.What sold me on the Sony a77 over the Nikon D7100 was the EVF, in camera stabilization, in camera panoramas (which worked well on my NEX), focus peaking (very helpful if you are into focus stacking) and the 16-50mm f/2.8 \"kit \" lens.  Where I was really torn was that the d7100 does appear to have a slightly better sensor and less noise.  For me, I like to do nature and landscape work, so I'm ok using a tripod and a low ISO to manage that.  To that end, since I am out in nature and inclement weather can catch up to you, I also needed a weather resistant camera body AND lens.  It appears that the only Nikon lens that is weather resistant is the expensive Nikon 17-55mm f/2.8G, which sells for $1450.  SO, to get an equivalent setup with Nikon, the cost would be $2650 vs $1500 for the Sony w/ kit lens.  Also, compare the two lenses on SLRGear and check out the \"blur index.\"  Compare them at 16mm/17mm and f/4 and then at 55mm/50mm and f/5.6 and you'll see Sony actually out performs the Nikon at the sweet spot for both short and long focal lengths!  On top of all that, this camera is so much more feature rich, so I'll just save $1150 and learn to manage the additional noise!!Aside from the features, I really like the camera layout too.  I was able to start using most of the controls with my eye to the EVF within a couple days.  They are really intuitive.  The only negative is the placement of the knob to change the focus (continuous, manual, etc) as I rest my hand close to it and it presses into the side of my palm.  I just need to tweak my hand hold and that will be a non-issue.I am really liking this camera and plan to get the Tamron AF 70-300mm f/4.0-5.6 USD XLD to fill out the long end.  I wish one camera could have it all, but I guess there are compromises with everything and, for this, it was a little more noise.  If noise is critical and you don't need or want a lot of amazing features or an affordable weather resistant lens, then maybe the Nikon d7100 is for you, but don't write off Sony until you give them a try.UPDATE:Well, I got buyers remorse.... almost.  I began to second guess my decision based on the noise issue.  It really is there if you take your ISO too high (higher that I was used to with my NEX).  When comparing it against my NEX-5n it was worse by between 1-2 stops.  Then I compared real world use with them.  What I found is that, due to the lenses alone, I gain 1-2 stops based on maximum aperture.  What that means is I can capture the same scenes with the same amount of noise just because I can gain a couple stops from the lens.  Yes, you have to be concerned with depth of field, but it just means tweaking your shooting style a little.  You also become a little more intimate with hyperfocal distances (download a calculator app, it will be a life saver).If there were a 16-50mm f/2.8 lens available for NEX, that would be another story.  I have fallen in love with this lens and could not go back to anything else.  Even if they introduced one for NEX, it would be way more expensive for sure. (EDIT: Sony just announced the Sony 16-70mm F4 for e-mount.  Its 1-stop slower and $400 more, assuming the 16-50mm is purchased as part of the kit.)  Of course, I could use this lens with the adapter, but I'd lose Image Stabilization and then I'm just trying to make the NEX work when I don't need to.  Furthermore, I took pictures of a landscape with both cameras and the A77 just had more detail and punch.  Even if there was more noise, there is more detail captured so the overall image is still better.FYI, I am comparing these two since they are two I happen to own and all the review sites seem to like to compare these two on the noise issue.  I know you have Canikon alternatives, but, as I mentioned previously, the Nikon alternative is very expensive.  There also isn't really a Canon equivalent, but I considered the 60D with its equivalent lens at $600 + $1050 = $1650.  It was more $$ by only $150, but it was lower resolution and the sensor scored lower for color depth and dynamic range on DxOMark.  The low-light ISO score was about the same.  I would also lose out on all the great features of the Sony.I also happened to get my latest issue of Outdoor Photographer (Sept 2013) which had an article on the best DSLRs for wildlife.  Lo and behold, the A77 is listed in their table on p 74.  They also go a step further and explain that translucent mirror cameras have a particular advantage over the moving mirror type when in Live View mode since they can use phase detect focusing on moving animals vs. contrast based AF which is slower and cannot keep up with fast movement.Needless to say, I have convinced myself (again) that this is the best camera for me considering features, performance and price.

Many of those cameras were great machines and I shot thousands of pictures with them. Sometimes you find a camera that seems to take great pictures every time you press the shutter release, this is one of those cameras. I have had the camera for about a month and haven't had a single disappointing shot. I was worried about noise having read some reviews that downgraded the camera because of alleged issues.  Shouldn't have worried. Yes there is noise ( all digital cameras have it) in high ISO shots but shooting RAW and a quick once over in Lightroom easily renders very clean pictures. So, noise addressed, what else? The control set up of the camera while not as great as the A700 is still very well thought out and the basic functions are easy to manage. It's a good thing too as there are a ton of possibilities for set up and use of the camera. It is difficult to imagine anything that might be missing.  That said, if one is not up for playing with the vast selection of controls, setting the camera to Auto or Auto+ will do it all for you. Finally, the addition of HD video on top of the stills capability is just frosting on the cake. I am very pleased with the camera and can find nothing much that I would do differently.

Here are the day-to-day things I've noticed.Pros: - Auto+ mode is *smart*. It will do the right thing most of the time. - The SCN mode has right number of \"modes\": portrait, sunset, etc and they all work great. - The viewfinder can be adjusted so you won't need to find your reading glasses. - Videos are pretty. Auto focus makes it really nice, but noise from autofocus can be an issue especially with 3rd party lens. - Focus is FAST. I was always missing shots with my last camera. Not any more. - Auto ISO does this crazy cool thing where it takes snaps multiple photos in a fraction of a second, then combines them into a single, low-light, low grain picture.Cons: - Heavy (but rugged). Consider getting a high quality \"sling camera strap\" (search amazon) - Custom Sony flash connector. You'll need a $10 adapter to use your existing flash. - Batteries don't last long, get extras. - HDR, while cool is slow. Auto+ will sometimes decide it's the right thing to do, but then you're stuck waiting for the processor to combine images. - No time lapse. I miss this fun feature, but if you buy a $30 Remote Timer Control and combine images on your computer then you can do it. Just not easy/fun. - Shutter click is louder than expected.Recommendations:1. Get the camera with the Sony lens \"kit\" (bundled together).It's worth $700, but the bundle only charges you $600. I've used multiple lens with with A77 and the \"stock\" one is excellent. Fast focus and solid performer. You can always sell it on eBay for a profit if you don't want it.2. If you want a camera to take everywhere, then this is NOT the one.If it's too heavy and big, then go check out the (currently back-ordered) Sony NEX-7. It's basically the same camera but in a smaller form factor.3. Get a SDHC UHS-I Memory Card. The A77 will take advantage of its 80mb/s write speeds for video and continuous shooting mode.

Other owners have given great detailed technical reviews so I will not be repetitive.  I own the Sony Alpha A330 10.2 MP Digital SLR Camera with Super SteadyShot INSIDE Image Stabilization (Body)Sony a330 and the Sony Alpha DSLR-A550 14.2MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)Sony a550 camera bodies as well.  I was considering switching to Canon or Nikon because of their massive lens selections.  I own a few Sony G Series lenses and three Zeiss lenses.  When you couple them with this new a77 it is an amazing package and will compare evenly and in some cases outperform both Nikon and Canon.  I am a wildlife and nature/landscape photographer.  I am very active in the field never sitting still and always moving.  The feature that I love the most about the Sony is the built in image stabilizer in the camera.  I very seldom use a tripod as I want to be able to move and hike freely.  I couple the a77 with the Sony SAL70400G 70-400mm f/4-5.6 G SSM Lens, Sony 70-200mm f/2.8 SSM Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera or the Sony 24 -70mm f/2.8 Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar lensSony 24 -70mm f/2.8 Carl Zeiss Vario Sonnar T Zoom Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Cameras.  When I use the 400mm lens at full zoom and no tripod the images come out crystal clear with no noise and vibrant colors.  Even when I attach the Sony 2x teleconverter their is still no noise distortion and very sharp images.  The HD video is a wonderful feature which I also use.  I would personally add the Sony vertical grip with a hand grip when you use larger lenses in the field.  Makes for a more stabile ensemble.  I was recently in Alaska for a 10 day photo expedition through Denali and Katmai National Parks.  I took over 2,000 photos each day.  I visited with numerous photographers on my journey and I would take my personal bag of equipment made up of Sony over their's any day.  I look forward to upcoming rumored Sony equipment.  Anthony Kosobud Photography 9/3/2012", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Two Years Later, Still a Contender (from a Nikon User)", "Author": "NyReckDiver", "ReviewID": "R1HCD970G718FK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently, I had the opportunity to shoot with the SLT-A77 for an extended period.  As a heavy Nikon user (D300s and D800) with \u201call things Nikon,\u201d I was ready for a serious let down, especially concerning build quality and using an Electronic Viewfinder (coming from optical).  Boy was I wrong.First, the build and design quality of the camera is tangibly at a professional grade (some may say semi-professional).  In the hands, the camera feels fantastic (medium sized hands) and clearly, the engineers did some serious research and focus groups. While the camera is light compared to my Nikon D300s or D800, it has a solid feel due to the magnesium  alloy body and professional rubber grip, and thumb placement (critical for serious shooting in my opinion).  All the camera controls feel solid and professional, with more than sufficient tactile feedback for use without pulling the camera away from your eye, or shooting in the dark.  The articulated LCD screen is very bright, even in daylight use.I have never been a fan of menu driven camera controls and as a Nikon user of the D300s and D800, I rely on external camera controls to the point of operating solely on feel.  Without getting into extensive boring details concerning camera control layout (Nikon users have this reputation), let me just say the external controls are more than sufficient and the layout is intuitive, even coming from another system.  Many of the dials perform dual functions and this will require some practice to master.The Electronic View Finder, my most serious concern prior to trying the A77, flawed me.  In fact, not only was it not difficult to use, I found I missed it when I went back to an optical viewfinder. A key difference between an optical and electronic viewfinder is understanding that the optical viewfinder shows you what you are seeing, compared to the electronic viewfinder that shows what the sensor is seeing, including not only the actual image composition (at 100%), but exposure as well.  The EVF reflects all changes you make to camera settings, live in the viewfinder.  This was a difficult, but useful, paradigm to break.  No more looking at the back of the DSLR after the shot, especially since the A77 plays back images directly in the viewfinder.  Keep in mind EVF technology has improved since the A77 launch (touted as the first true OLED viewfinder on market in 2011).  Nevertheless, the A77 EVF is simply fantastic and shows no sign of its age though the new Fuji XT-1 (launch in March 2014) is being billed as the most advanced EVF to date with nearly zero lag.  A key concern for me concerning any EVF is lag.  In this case, the Sony EVF does in fact evidence minor lag when panning very quickly.  This lag is mainly evident around the edges.  Ironically, the lag does not impact my shooting in any regard.  However, if you are a sports shooter, you may want to opt for more recent products.  The EVF, while great for portraits, landscape, and even moderately paced movement, seems to lag when it comes to sports.  This is most noticeable in continuous shooting modes.  Either way, I recommend fast SD cards if you will be shooting raw with this camera.  Since I normally shoot portraits and landscape, this is not an issue for me.Image quality of the A77 is typical for Sony- fantastic.  Dynamic range is superb, though I still personally prefer my D300s, which is a fair comparison (APS-C compared to APS-C). This preference may be solely due to my post processing workflow and how Lightroom and Photoshop handle the raw files.  However, as I said, that is my personal preference.  DXO Mark rates the A77 sensor a little better than the D300s sensor.  I will note that I also prefer the Nikon D300s noise reduction to the Sony noise reduction, especially when shooting jpegs.The current pricing (about $600 less than when first launched) combined with build quality and availability of a wide range of lenses (Minolta and Sony)  makes this camera a very good buy for someone stepping up from Point and Shoot (typical sub $200 compact camera) or advanced Point and Shoot (think Nikon P7700).Final Note:  I am a very heavy user of the Nikon Creative Lighting system.  However, I cannot comment on Sony lighting options as I do not have enough experience other than to say the onboard flash is decent for minor fill flash, and that\u2019s it (no different than the Nikon D800).  I also don\u2019t shoot video, so I will leave a review of video capabilities to more qualified reviewers.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far...not bad at all with a few quirks", "Author": "Shinebox", "ReviewID": "R3R5ECEYOMOGWN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just a quick warning before you read, I am well educated in photography thanks to YouTube and flickr forums... :-)I will update this review as I go along but after this first picture outing I have come to the conclusion that I must be doing something wrong here cause I know this camera has to take better pictures then what i witnessed on my laptop today.Eee gads... 70% of the pics were out of focus and the rest that were in focus were overexposed terribly. A few seemed exposed OK but they just didn't look right. I'll give the camera the benefit of the doubt cause it was a cloudy day and I had ISO up at 1600 at times, mosly 800 though to get fast action shots of seagulls being fed by some kids.My settings were:Vivid picture mode (+1 sharpness)Autofocus with 18-135 lens - SONYWhite Balance was Cloudy DayI didn't set exposure comp so it was 0I was zoomed out at about probably 100 + mm most of the time.I noticed a few times the high speed multi picture rate stopped after a few pics, maybe my card isn't fast enough, I have a new one on order.One other thing i noted was the OLED viewfinder went black when I put my eye up to it after looking at the LCD. I had to pull back and then reset my eye on viewfinder and then it was ok.Other then that this camera is built like a tank and has some great picture features. Ergonomics are great also and button placement is easy to access for changing settings.I have been doing some research on the web a day or two after I wrote the above information and I see some forums about people having issues with autofocusing for action photography but i also see some spectacular shots of people who have had success with this camera. A good thing is they included some settings for how they took these pictures and I am going to apply them the next time i go out and shoot. People seem to have good results using spot metering with single point focus in continuos focus mode which i did not have set. I think i had auto focus with all the focus points (wide area) in play so it probably picked the wrong focus point with the type of shots i was aking. With birds flying all over they are going in and out of the viewfinder and it is probably getting confused at which focus point to select, my guess or I am picking the wrong time to release the shutter. I have a 300mm SONY zoom on order and will try that one also.If anyone could help here i would appreciate it, I will update the star rating as i use and test out some more this week. I'm not giving up on this camera.** Update January 19, 2013 **I have been getting more used to this camera as i go along. One thing I would like to recommend to anyone new to this camera is get to know your focus options really well. I found that taking the Wide area focus point out of the picture and using spot focusing or either Local (zone focusing) is the key. I did some test portrait shots and noticed the pictures were a tad out of focus. I did have spot focusing on but i also had face detection on cause I noticed that the squares in the camera LCD would track my face when i came into view. This is cool but it doesn't give you the sharpest focus. Well maybe it does for smaller apertures but in my case I was using a 1.8 50mm lens. When i took off face detection and focused like a laser at the eye of the person in the portrait, Bam! crystal clear when zoomed all the way in. What a difference. So keep that in mind.A couple things i am still noticing is the OLED when I look at the LCD fast and look back at the OLED sometimes it boes black, a quick pull away from the camera and back to the OLED and it's fine. I think they still need to speed that feature up. No biggie just have to adjust to it.One other thing i also noticed is that autofocus on a few of my lenses seems to hunt a little more then i would like to see. It doesn't pick up focusing quick in some situations. Noticed this on a couple lenses but all in all i do love the camera.Noise issues?Also a quick note on image quality/noise for the pictures this camera takes. I have seen a lot of reviews and comments in user forums about the lack of quality over 1600 ISO. I did a few test shots at ISO 3200 with this camera and the D7000. Let me tell you that the Nikon is way way better at higher ISO's without any noise reduction applied. Now.. hold off from posting the A77 on EBAY, you can make an adjustment or two that will help here. 2 options you have are: Change the settting in the menu (High ISO Noise reduction) to High and this will help some. The other option is to use the High ISO noise reduction option that's part of the ISO setting (when you change ISO sensitivity from the LCD). Below ISO 50 there is an option that will say High ISO Noise Reduction, use this and take a picture in low light. It will take a few pics quickly, process and spit out a picture. The quality is actually pretty good, it came extremely close to the High ISO picture quality king (D7000). I was pretty satisfied. I think you shouldn't have to do this and that ISO 3200 out of the camera would produce a decent pic but maybe SONY will make some adjustments to thier algorithm for High ISO usage, IDK just a wish for future.Get to know the camera and you will enjoy it, I really feel like The Terminator or Predator when looking through the viewfinder. Feel like I'm in some futuristic world. :-) It's different then any other camera which is what makes it interesting to use. I really like it but until i get used to it some more the money in the bank cameras are my Nikon and Canon.** Update 3/19/2013I have been using this camera a lot lately and have noticed a few quirky things. First off the viewfinder is very laggy, when i put my eye up to it i have noticed a few times that it goes black and i have to move my face away and re engage the viewfinder to reset it. Maybe it doesn't like my ugly face? IDK. I also noticed when taking pictures i get a focus lock but pressing down on the shutter release button is hit or miss sometmes in low lighting. i had a terrible time this past weekend at an indoor cat show where the lens would not engage and i could not take a shot. My daugher was clicking away endlessly with my Canon 60D with a kit lens no issues. I was using the 18-135 kit lens. her pics were way better so i kept hers, not 1 keeper from my A77. I just ordered a Sigma 17-70 for it and am going to dump my 18-135.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera!", "Author": "mtipper \"mtipper\"", "ReviewID": "R1SC0LM1872RZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a well-reviewed camera in many quarters.

It's a fair trade in my book.  Makes spot metering (for blue skies, for instance) a MUCH easier proposition.In the actual image, the details that WILL show up in the shadows do show a bit of noise, even at ISO 100.  (At least it does with JPG and DRO turned on.  With RAW and no DRO, you may get cleaner shadows, but they'll probably have less detail.  I haven't bothered to shoot RAW yet, since I like DRO).But, it's very pleasing noise.  You can leave it in, or take it out.  With 24mp to work with, it probably won't show up anyways in your output.  I shoot ISO 3200 without a problem.I compared it to medium format digital at base ISO.  Yes, the medium format back was much cleaner in the shadows.  But it has a sensor 4 times as big, with 1/4 the gain, capturing 16 TIMES as much light.  Kinda stands to reason, doesn't it?By analogy, the A77 is like shooting 200ISO negative C-41 film, versus 50ISO slide film on the digital back.  The digital back gives you better results in perfect conditions, but the A77 gives you better (and faster and easier) results the other 90% of the time.

Here's my case....The first chance I had to take this camera out in public was to my son's 3rd grade school play.  One of my fears of having a camera such as this was realized when another parent, who also had a professional looking camera, kept looking at my camera and asked me something about the aperture or f-stops or something like that.  I was like, \"Dude, I don't even know.\"  As this was just a day after getting the camera, I wasn't at all familiar with most of the camera's features.  At one point, I held the camera high in the air, view screen angled down so I could see perfectly, and I inadvertently held the button down and rattled off one of those 12-shots-per-second rounds.  The parent who was just talking to me, looked stunned!  Of course, I acted like it was all intentional.... Later, I watched other parents trying to get up close to the stage to snap off a picture or two.  One thing that I realized was that with 24.3 MP's I could probably stay put and, sitting at my computer later, could photo shop my pics for some crisp closeups.So, yes, I get home and review my pictures.  I was impressed.  I don't take pictures like this.You see, I have always owned the cheaper, lower-end, automatic kind of cameras.  Reason being, I felt intimidated by my lack of camera knowledge.  Why would I spend THAT much money on a camera that I would never be able to learn how to use?  Don't get me wrong, though; The thought always hounded me.  Deep down, when I would see people out and about with really nice cameras, I wondered if having a camera of quality like that would make a difference in MY quality of photos.  Would I be able to take those great photos like what you see in magazines?I was given a chance to answer that with Sony.  What I found is that this camera can be just as easy to use, as fully automatic as I want it to be, or as adjustable as I want.  There was no need to sit down and pour over the manual (which is pretty detailed btw) for endless hours before I could learn to operate this camera.  I was able to take some great pictures with little knowledge.  And, as time has gone by, I have been able to look through the manual and play around with some of the different settings...and take even BETTER pictures.This is the camera I will be using for the rest of my life.  When my son has a school play, a band concert, is out on the soccer field, marching through high school graduation, I'll be there capturing those quality moments with a beautiful Sony camera.  So, is it worth it?  How much are YOUR family pictures worth?  If you're like me at all, believe when I say, you can use this camera effectively and the memories you capture will be breathtaking and priceless.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ghosting like A33&A55; update", "Author": "Eugene C.

Tried with the 16-50mm kit lens at 18 and again at 55mm it is the same. Tried the 55-200mm SAM Sony lens and it is the same thing.PLEASE SEE NOTE AT END OF THIS REVIEW ON GHOSTINGSo 4 stars day time images are really detailed and nice. it is only the night time shooting that is effected. Camera is like a tank, really well built and nice to hold. 16-50mm kit lens is really smoothand quiet in autofocus. You don't even know it worked it is so fast and quiet.Focus was right on with out any fine tuning, which the camera can do.Tried a minolta 50mm 1.7 AF lens, worked fast with only the little noise of auto focus.Tried a Quantaray28-300mm for minolta lens 3.5-6.3 72mm filter LDO multi coated. This was said to be a cheap lens made bymaybe tamron.On the A77 this focus is so fast the lens doesn't make any more noise than the sony 55-200mm SAM lens. I would rate the lens higher than the sony 55-200mm on this camera. wasn't so on my A33.Using Sandisk extreme pro SDHC UHS-I card the buffer does fill when shooting at 12 FPS but the buffer empties fast with this card.The ghosting ,night time use not as good as A55 and small buffer are the short falls to this camera that I see from my use so far.it was a toss up between purchasing this camera or the Nikon D7000.The Nikon has a slightly better image quality and better at night time shooting but the Sony A77 has all the new technology in it. I thought I'd like the view finder in the Nikon better but after using the new electronic view finder on the A77 I'll never go back to a pentiprism,it is that good. And I've been using slr camera's for 40 years.If you have small hands you should try the camera before buying, but it really isn't any heaver tha a Nikon D7000.May update this after I've used the camera for several more monthsWould like to up date the Ghosting I reported at the start of the review.After a comment by Edward BoydI tried the same shots of the moon without a filter. NO ghosting, Thank you edward! Seems the filter was giving me a reflection never had that happen to me before. Live and learn.Have really enjoyed the camera and glad I purchased it.

This review is not technical at all.  I'll use Leiman terms to describe the camera.This is however my 5th DSLR in one year.  I've been upgrading and keeping my cameras for about 2 - 3 months each.This one however, I might keep longer.I really think Sony made a different camera with the A77.  I think Canon and Nikon are so far behind in technology and they will have now try and catch Sony.  They probably have better optics but that's changing specially with Sony being influenced by Carl Zeiss.The second you put the viewfinder to your eye, you know the camera is going to give you a totally different experience.  With a gyroscope telling you if your frame is crooked and with all of the information right there on the screen, the feeling is fantastic.  You control aperture and speed with two separate rings and Iso right there with your fingers easily learning where to go.Then you start using the LCD that you can swivel in so many different positions.  This is great for many occasions in which you can't simply throw yourself to the ground or you cannot get higher than your extended arms.The camera is really fast thanks to the Translucent Shutter and you feel it on the very first shot.  Auto Focus and Manual focus, everything feels so smooth with this camera.I did get the camera with the 16-50 mm 2.8 lens which adds a big deal of weight to it.  When shooting an event you'll feel tired after 3 hours holding that camera.  I purchased a Kata sling to hold it below my chest with little or no effort.Overall, this is a great camera worth every penny and a revolutionary one that has led me away from looking at more expensive options.  I liked it so much that I now have a little companion:  a Sony Nex 6, basically the same viewfinder so I feel very used to it when I switch from one to the other.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm in Love", "Author": "Photo taker", "ReviewID": "R35DTGEOO6LFOA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first SLR was a Minolta.

These cameras are all so feature rich that it takes a long time only to read about them in the manual. A77 has the full metal body, weather-sealing, 24MP, 12fps, and so many more features. I do not bother you here with the technical details, because I know you already have researched all the available sources; however, if you have not checked out Gary Friedman's book yet, it is worth to do so. Just the features introduction is more than 60 pages in his book, and you will learn a lot about this camera and shooting techniques.I have switched from Canon, not because of picture quality or style, but for having more in-camera features. The built quality of A77 is wonderful. From its touch and feel to the operation and looks, everything feels just right. A77 is well balanced and easy to hold. OLED viewfinder is amazing, and features like digital magnification make it easier to focus precisely. The articulated LCD makes it fun to take pictures at odd angles or high up on the tripod. The operation is smooth, and this camera delivers very nice huge pictures. On the negative side, the pictures have more grains in low-light compared to Canon, but it is not a deal breaker.I recommend getting a fast memory card and perhaps spare battery pack. I got the Sony Media 32 GB SDHC Flash Memory Card (SF32NX/TQ), but camera takes a few seconds to write each JPEG to the card. Now, I wished I got either Sony 32 GB PRO-HG Duo HX Memory Stick MSHX32B (Black) or SanDisk Extreme Pro, SDHC, UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 619659070977 for their wonderful transfer rates. I also find the batteries ran out more quickly than my Canon 30D's used to. You may need to have a spare battery pack in near future. The camera took a long time to shut itself off, but the new 1.05 firmware solved this problem. The camera is more responsive after the update.If you do a lot of family pictures, I recommend getting an IR remote. I recently got one, and it is great. I didn't get the expensive Sony Alpha RMT-DSLR1 Camera Remote (Black), and I just got the Opteka RC-3 Wireless Remote Control for Sony Alpha A33, A55, NEX-5, A230, A330, A380, A390, A450, A500, A550, A560, A580, A700, A850, A900 (RMT-DSLR1 Replacement). It has a very long range and works great with A77.I was skeptical at Sony in the beginning, but I am satisfied with my choices. Sony has done a wonderful job with this camera. In addition to the camera, I have gotten 16-50 kit lens for all-around, 35mm f/1.8 for experience, Vivitar 7mm for wide angles, and 70-300G for telephoto and candid shots. I love all of them. Granted, the quality of Sony lenses and glasses, even in the \"G\" series, is not yet in par with Canon \"L\" series, but Sony has just started the revolution, and it is admirable what they have accomplished in such a short time.

I've done a bit of professional work, but mostly this is just a hobby and passion. I am used to shooting with a Canon rebel T1i, (That I love) so that is how i'm basing my review.There are several things that i enjoy about this camera.Color - In my opinion, the slt-a77 does a great job at capturing a wider range of colors. its as if my eyes have been opened wider. I am not talking about the saturation of colors, but they images seem to have a truer color space to them. This was an unexpected upgrade when i bought this camera, i never noticed this with my T1i, but looking back now, it is a noticeable difference.Digital Viewfinder - This camera has a digital viewfinder that replaces a traditional optical setup. When first researching this camera i was weary of this feature. I had read reviews stating that it was slow to react and would even cause some people to miss their shots. i can honestly say that this has never happened for me, and i hardly even notice it starting up. being able to change display overlays when looking through the camera is really neat, and even sometimes quite useful. its a high quality image with tons of rang, and little lag. The only downside is that when your shooting in the dark the screen will display a good amount of noise trying to give you as much light as possible.I love the way this camera feels in the hand. Just the right amount of heft that lets you know this ain't no toy, but not overbearing. they did a nice job to shaping the grip to naturally form to your hand, its comfortable and gives you much more confidence that its not going to it slip.Other - there are a few other notable features that i also enjoy but are pretty well known. The flip-out LCD is useful and i find myself using it more and more to make shooting those awkward angles easy. Its auto-focus is really sharp for me and i was able to capture some great shots of my dog running straight at me - this coupled with the super fast shutter speed means you'll have many shots to choose from. It also does a great job with handling video, able to capture 60pfs and 24fps at 1080p , enabling those video buffs out there to have a wider control of style.The cameras software comes packed with a plethora of shooting modes to tackle any situation, and of course you get full control over everything in manual mode. (i found that transitioning from my Canon to the Sony not that difficult).However, you're probably wondering why its only 4 stars.I've got the same remarks of everyone else - high ISO performance is just sub-par. I knew this when i purchased the camera so i wasn't surprised. But to me its not that bad of an issue, it just keeps the camera from being perfect. To combat this issue the camera has a \"Handheld Twilight\" mode that does a decent job at getting rid of noise. It works well but the image detail will take a hit. Honestly, if your going to be shooting in the dark, and you want it to look perfect, you need a tripod.

Note, for the owners of the a65 i recommend putting it up for sale because if you purchase the 16-50 you'll be at the price point of the A77 kit. Only makes sense then right? There is a significant difference with the autofocus engine that the A77 uses versus the A65. Picture quality and overall focus in all modes on the A77 is leaps and bounds above the A65 and its quite staggering putting pictures up side by side. I guess if you were to manual focus both bodies on the same lens you'd have the exact result since they technically have the same sensor but that can also mean a missed shot or opportunity. The A77 features are great, right out of the box without much tweaks the pics are crisp and with the 16-50(FRIGGIN AMAZING LENS!!) its just the perfect combo. The 16-50 is a HEAVY lens but its quality thru many reviews rival that of the 16-80CZ lens and person experience echos that as well. I'd recommend this to anyone that take their hobby serious, im by no means a pro or would ever tout myself to be but i love to take photos. The A77 does almost everything for you in body and saves you money all while doing it. The ability to use quality minolta lenses is a huge plus! I've taken about 80 photos with the A77 and versus the A65 i tend to have more keepers out of each group so this thing is making me feel like a pro because it's just so good.Pros:Build quality, magnesium body16-50 f2.8 kit lens is AMAZINGLY SHARP!Articulating LCDCamera features are worth the upgrade, lens correction being my favoriteAble to use Minolta lenses. Fyi, sony has repurposes many of these older lenses and rebranded themCons:The 16-50 is HEAVYI already had two extra extended batteries from the A65 but the A77 consumes more battery especially with the lcd in useI think that's about it. I've own Nikon cameras and use to be devoued  but i don't think i'll ever turn back. The features you get in a sony body is leaps and bounds over what Nikon (old d5200 & p510 owner). I think to be fair, the A77 is more comparable to the new d7000 but i've never own it so i cant say much. I know this review wasn't very objective but buy the camera, if you dont like it, return it but  I'm sure you will love it. The camera will blow your mind with the 16-50 lens and will make you feel like a pro with the quality of pics it takes.

When in Auto-ISO mode, it picks ISOs that are too high.

Sometimes it take two full seconds for it to respond to setting changes, menu presses and even longer to review already taken photos.I was hoping that the Sony would become my primary camera but, for now, it will be regulated to taking posed, group photos where I have time to deal with the time needed to change settings.

This camera has a lot of features that some of the more expensive models are missing or charge extra for, and the price was better than comparable Canon and Nikon models.  Being that the Alpha line is built on Minolta technology, I had no problems using my existing lenses, which was a big plus for my decision to buy.So far I have been extremely pleased with this camera.  It does a lot better than expected in low light situations.  The continuous shooting mode is extremely fast, and the auto-focus works really well.  The electronic viewfinder took a little bit of getting used to, especially when shooting in low light, but once you do you will wonder how you survived without it!  I have not used the video mode all that much, but from what I have tested it works really well.  I like the phase detect auto focus in video mode, which keeps you from having to manually focus while shooting video.  The one drawback I have noticed, however, is that the lens is somewhat noisy while auto-focusing, which may be picked up on video.The big drawbacks I have noticed is the inability to use some of the extra features while shooting in raw.  The in-camera HDR function, some of the screen modes and a lot of the other features can be used in JPG mode only, which is kind of disappointing. However, while these features would be nice, it's works out fine to process these manually when working with RAW files.Overall I am extremely happy with this camera.

The mirror technology and the 16-50 mm lens make for clear accurate shots. I bought the David Busch's Sony Alpha SLT-A77 Guide to Digital Photography to help me utilize this camera, a huge step up from my beloved but aged Olympus. I also bought David Busch's Sony Alpha SLT-A77/A65 Compact Field Guide to take with me in a camera case. The Sony actually has a function that tells you what each setting is for, but when I'm in the middle of trying to capture a picture I don't want to have to stop and read the view finder. The large viewfinder on back is excellent, and you can switch to the eye viewfinder. It also helps to buy a memory card that can keep up with this camera so that ever few pictures you don't have to wait while it writes to memory.The camera is large and weighs in at 6 lbs. That can become heavy when tromping through the woods or around the french quarter. it's a camera I take specifically to take pictures, as opposed to a little point and shoot I throw in my purse and take pictures of my day, food, desk , ugly shoes, etc. This is a serious camera to haul around.The pictures are high quality, the HD video is amazing. The A77 is not an intuition based camera. Out of the box it really does take great pictures, but to really utilize and work the camera to it's potential I had to play and experiment a lot, but hey, that is fun!

Loos", "ReviewID": "R2BN4ODNH8BROG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I held off on reviewing this camera for a little while because I wanted to give it some time. I'm glad I did. Before getting this camera I researched dslr's like crazy! Countless hours have been spent finding just the perfect camera. For the money, I am convinced that this is the best camera you can buy. The reason I say that is because for under $2k, you can get a professionally built camera (weather sealed and all) and a professional grade lens (also weather sealed). No other manufacturer does this for this price. The Nikon d7000 would be the next best option but you can't get that camera and a nice professional grade lens for under $2k. The kit lens is okay on that camera but I wanted the whole package--camera and lens. What's the point of buying an expensive camera if you're going to slap on a plastic lens? Everywhere I read continued to say that glass is where you get the good photos from. The next runner up would be the Canon Mark II. Of course, the III would be ideal but breaks the bank. Again, the problem with the Mark II is that the camera is the price of the a77 for the body only. To buy the 24-70 2.8 lens which is canon's favorite among professional photographer's, it would cost you an extra $2k. I've also read numerous reviews on the Sony lens and everywhere has it matching up with all of the other big boy lenses. I think it would be obvious to say that the Canon lens is superior but is also three times as much! The Sony lens does not pale in comparison. Sony's 16-50 2.8mm lens is the equivalent of Canon's lens because of the 1.5X factor on non-full frame cameras like the a77. Again, it compares with all the big boys, even Canon's $2,000 lens.I've come to realize that you have to learn how to use this camera, which I am still doing, before you can adequately review it. Once you learn a few of the tricks the photos are amazing! I've been cropping like crazy in Lightroom 4 and I am amazed at how well the photos crop. That means you can also blow them up and they will retain the great image quality. Love it! One reviewer helped me to understand how to use the focus points. I think he's right, that's key. Once you learn that and get out of always just shooting in the Auto settings, you'll find that you're able to get better pictures. Of course, the Auto settings are still great. Again, I'm still learning this camera but as I learn more, I realize how great of a camera it really is. I also think it's one of the better looking cameras out there and better built as well. The 50mm 2.8 lens is also a beauty and very well built. The lens is very professional looking and has a great feel to it. You can tell it's high quality when you hold it.In summary, I am convinced that this is the best camera you can buy for the money. I love the EVF as other reviewers have commented and all of the extra features that come with the camera. There are so many extra bonuses that come with this camera that have been explained through other reviews.

In the mean time I was happily using the 55v as my main shooter. Still, from time to time, I would visit the Sony store and hold this beauty in my hands, dreaming of the day.Well the day arrived, and I've been using the A77 and could not be happier. It is a beast compared to the 55v, much stouter, heavier, a definite handful. But that is what you pay for in quality. It is a much more rugged machine than the 55v as well. While a crop sensor, this camera is in every way a match for it's full framed cousin,  but at a fraction of the cost. In one aspect it actually outshines the full frame and that is in rapid fire shooting. I found that it really can not keep up at that 10 frames per second burst for long, but that may be a case of the SD card I have on board (and yes a smallish buffer for the RAW images I shoot.)I really love the way the back articulates, I've been able to set up some unorthodox shots by using that finder. It will actually set up a rather nice selfie if that is your thing as well. Waist level shooting is fairly easy but sometimes gets washed out by the sun. On the opposite end you can do a decent job of holding the camera overhead and still framing the shot. The weight of camera will get in the way with your arms fully extended though.I can not speak to the in-camera tools as I shoot strictly in RAW and only use the panorama feature. This is only sore spot I have with the unit as it requires you to shoot absolutely level and to move rather briskly around to get the shot. Any kind of upward or downward drift or a too slow sweep and the camera will give up. It can get frustrating. But this is very much an operator error kind of issue, sweep level and steady and the shot will be genius.My only real concern with this camera is whether Sony and the independents will still support it. With the new E mount cameras coming out, especially the a7 and a7R, will Sony still have a place in it's heart for the old translucent mirror cameras? Both seem safe for now as the the shiny new ILC's can only shoot at 2.5 frames per second.

I would always have it, as no other camera every felt as good in my hand.But finally the desire to have video too for shooting events at my daughter's school drove me to look again at the A77.  I had looked many times since it came out.  Liked the features.  But really never like the electronic viewfinder - EVF.The recent price reduction made it by far the best camera under $1000 and I think under $1400.  Magnesium body, Tilt Screen, weather sealing.  I looked at other systems willing to sell off my lenses and rebuild under Canon (which I use for astrophotography) or Nikon which also makes really great cameras.  If I thought they have the better camera in a similar price range ($900-$1100)But the value + my current set of lenses pushed past my EVF, concerns.After 5 days I sold be beloved A700.  The camera feels good in the hands.  IT is amazing to shoot with the image quality is greatThe AF during full video is nice to have if shooting sports etc.but I have to say except in very bright sun (where it is low or the sky is hazy)  The EVF is better than the Optical Viewfinders on the other APC cameras.  You see more in low light.  It lets you chose info, including showing you face detection focusing and a histogram.  But my favorite feature is manual focus peeking.  Where the EVF shows you live in still or video what is in focus by placing a user adjustable red, yellow or white glow on the areas of focus.It makes manual focus really nice.  When I am shooting Macro off my Sigma 17-70 C it makes finding focus points on something like a spider web so fast an easy..I give it 5 stars because I love it that much. There are things that could be better:EVF needs to be brighter for those glaring sun days.  You can shoot but the detail is harder to see.Sony should not have taken out tethered shooting.. on this camera.There are some buttons like WB and Help that I don't use.. I would like to be able to remap to another feature like you can many of the other buttons.I miss having two memory slots like the A700And it does use the battery faster so I keep one on my strap at all times.But if you want a solid camera, that takes great images and is easy to use.This is the best DSLR under $1400 in my book.  You need to look at Canon 7D with an older sensor or Nikon D300S also with an older sensor to get this kind of build and feature set.  And still they don't allow for fast AF during video, this large and useful a viewfinder, 12 FPS, 24 MP, etc.  This camera may be 2 years since release.  But in so many features it still is better than any camera under $1400 ($1390 etc)Sony makes more photo sensors than anyone and in most years sells more cameras than Nikon.  (Just not DSLRs yet)  This is a great camera.  And the large EVF went from a concern to a feature I love after only a few hours with the camera.The Amazon warranty extension covers damage too..

I bought this to replace my A55 for recent a trip to Europe (Italy, Switzerland).  All I can say is I am not only in love with this camera, I am in love with this 2.8 16-50 (24-75) lens.The digital EVF works fine.  In 2 weeks of shooting hundreds of pictures I never said, \"I wish this was a real viewfinder\" and actually the fact that when you change settings you see the result in the viewfinder BEFORE you take the picture is a big plus.They cramed about as much resolution as you can in a 2/3rds sensor, and I kept waiting to see extra noise, but it just was not there.  Now I did keep all my shooting at ISO 400 and under, but no issues if doing that.  What I love about the resolution is I can take a picture and still have plenty of room to zoom in and still have enough resolution to print even up to a 16\" wide print.The layout, 2 dials (as opposed to 1 on the A55) and joysick make navigating around about as intutive and easy as any full featured DSLR can be with all the gazillion options.  It is solidly built and weather sealed (and I did take it out in the rain with no issues).Now the lens.  I have had the Zeiss 3.5-4.5 16-80 (24-120) lens as my prime for years.  Awesome lens, but I hate to say it, I like this new 2.8 16-50 (24-75) lens even better.  (I think this is the first time a camera came with a default lens that was not junk!)  Read the professional reviews.  Yes it is a bit fat, but man, that constant 2.8 is awesome and allows you to take photos in much less light at higher speed (or lower ISO) then the Zeiss.  Now you do loose a little in zoom, but again the resolution allows more cropping so essentially I have the same resolution with this camera at 50(75)mm as I do with the A55 and Zeiss at 80(120)mm.Back at home I took a bunch of action photos of my Godson's soccer game with an inexpensive Tamron 70-300 (105-450) lens.  Oddest thing, I was very dissapointed with the quality of this lens and the A55, figuring it was the lens and you just get what you pay for.  But with the A77 the pictures looked great.  Better then with the A55.  I have no empirical data to back this up, but all I know is those pictures of my Godson playing soccer came out fantastic.This package, even at full price is a deal (the camera by itself is $900, the lens $800, so you save $200 with the bundle).  I would love to get the full frame A99, but after printing out a bunch of 16\" wide prints on my Epson 4880 for display I can not imagine the quality being any better, certinally not enough to warrent spending 3x the money.

I can't comment on those as I always have it in manual unless I'm handing it to someone who doesn't know how to use a DSLR.

Nice upgrade!One of the options that I've completely fallen in love with is the af/mf button on the back.  It allows me to hand hold the camera, auto focus on the subject, press the button, and move to adjust my scene.Haven't tried out the 3D panorama option yet, but looking forward to.I love Minolta.

The downside is the lens selection and the avaliable lens are pretty expensive for people like me.I hope sony will introduce an all in one lens 18-300mm range with an affordable price  like the Nikon did.

I've ran this camera through the gambit of lenses I've collected over the years and from my 1.8/50 to my 55-200 all images are crisp and crystal clear.  The dynamic range this camera achieves has blown my mind.  The viewfinder is probably the best feature.  Manual focus is a breeze for me now (I wear glasses and it's usually a task to use manual).  With or without glasses my images are now completely in focus.  I used to snap around 300 photos on an outing with my old a390 and maybe have around 50 usable images with luck.

It is touted as the worlds fastest shooting DSLR and well, I can believe that because I've seen my dad use his Nikon and this is a lot faster. Point, click and you are done. Sharp pictures, no mess no fuss.Included is the USB cable, which I find a little thin, the CD and a booklet. A really thick booklet which I am still trying to filter. I've come to the conclusion that I am basically going to have to learn a lot more about photography terms in order to hang with the more techie opinions here, but it has always been an interest in my family and I have a rather good teacher.The camera build feels incredible. It is heavy, but not unweidly. It is very solid. The LED screen is bright and vivid. The wall charger is a breeze, you might want a lens dust cover, an extra battery, a carry case and an HDMI cable.I will be sure to update this with any further thoughts and opinions.

It has pros and cons like any product, however there are some drawbacks that may deter you to another brand. First a quick list of some things I like and then the negatives.PROs:FAST, FAST, FAST! This thing can focus and shoot faster than any other camera I have used. AT LEAST this is true in decent lighting, not so much in low lighting obviously. Don't expect miracles. The 12 frame burst shooting is great! And it can even manage to keep up with focus (depending on the lens you're using).For video, the focus is quite acceptable. It is much faster, usually much more accurate than other cameras, and some of the gimmick features like face recognition and smile detection are mostly just for looks but can sometimes be useful.This thing is lightweight and enjoyable to use! Weather resistance (for the body, not most of the lenses). The battery life is quite acceptable. The size isn't overbearing. It's a great camera to carry around when it comes to stamina.The shutter noise is less than other brands/models I have used.The built-in sensor cleaner actually seems to be quite effective!The rest of the pro's I can think of really aren't unique to this brand or model so I'll move on:CONs:Okay, this camera does have some serious flaws that, after owning and using as my main camera for a year, has caused me to wish I'd of opted for a Canon or Nikon.I'll be the first to say this honestly, in my opinion, the images produced with this camera in low light are full of ugly noise. I'm not entirely sure if this is a problem with the sensor or with the lenses I use. Even images with decent lighting, when viewing the full image on a monitor, they're breathtaking, beautiful. When viewing up close at 100% resolution, however, they turn ugly and show noise and artifacts and aren't as sharp/crisp as I'd like. Honestly the difference compared to other brands at this price range is probably un-noticable but worth mentioning.The OLED EVF is NOT a good replacement for optical viewfinding. Sure, the quality is acceptable, and it gives you a good idea of what the image will look like with current settings, and allows you to see all the various display information overlayed (such as the digital \"level\" which is a nice feature but I'd say only 95% accurate), as well as playback images and whatnot, (and see video you are shooting while shooting it through the viewfinder). Some of these things are great, but in the end, the OLED can also be a major setback. Probably the most obvious is the functionality in low-light scenarios. You CANNOT pull a focus of stars while trying to shoot a starry timelapse. You cannot pull a focus of a person in a dark room because the viewfinder is drowning in the ugly \"Sony\" noise. Basically, with optical, seeing through the viewfinder is only limited to your own eye, not to the sensor and OLED and that whole process. This can be a dealbreaker. I love taking time-lapse shots of stars and now I have to try and hunt for the right focal length through trial and error. If I shoot \"light-painting\" photos, I have to first cast a light on the subject to pull a focus. This can really be a limitation.I agree with other reviewers that these Sony lenses are much too expensive for what they offer. The build quality in the lower-end models is very cheap. Some of the lenses are quite noisy with focus. The total lack of cross-compatiblity with other lenses is a setback (only Sony or Minolta lenses allowed). Sony lenses also don't work with other bodies, i.e. cinema cameras, unlike Canon. The optics are mediocre at best, though I have yet to try the $2000+ lenses.The hot-shoe mount being proprietary is quite obnoxious. Can't mount anything to it without adapters which are over=priced for the quality made ones.The in-camera microphone for video recording is, as expected, just about unusable.Cannot plug the HDMI into a 720p display, 1080p only.The images in burst mode can take a very long time to write to the card at times depending on content of image and quality being written.The image stabilization while recording video produces very odd and annoying results, with certain things in the image being stabilized (i.e. the sky/clouds, the trees) and other things in the same frame being unstabilized (i.e. the subject), which creates this odd \"warping\" effect, almost like some sort of rotoscoping (see Waking Life, A Scanner Darkly, where certain things in the image are whirling around and other things are more static). It can turn a nice shot into something a little more like an acid trip. Not sure what is up with that but it has ruined some shots of mine. Better to leave IS off and do it in After Effects instead.Overall, if you can look past these flaws, it's a great low-end camera to use, especially for video or sports. The ultra-fast focus and shooting speeds really make up for many of the flaws, but not all. Sony makes excellent products, one of the few Camera companies that actually produces films as well, using their own cameras, so they have the experience with filmmaking that they seem to be incorporating into their newer products, hopefully the future will bring better results. But, perhaps unsurprisingly, this is the first line of camera implementing the \"translucent mirror technology\", and still has setbacks. The incompatibility with other lenses or hot-shoe accessories is a real drag. But if fast focus is what you need at this price range, look no further.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ready for the shot", "Author": "M.

I like how fluid the video footage is from this camera which is much smoother than the canon 7d I own.  The water flow is a very accurate measure of what you can expect to see for moving objects.Another feature I like is the speed with a quick video card that it can shoot.  I haven't felt like I was missing many shots because it's almost always ready for the next one.  It also seems to zero in and focus much faster than other cameras I have used.The weight is comparable to the 7d and other amateur to pro cameras.  A good camera bag is a good idea when carrying it around on trips as your neck will thank you.Overall I like this camera for both the color of photos even before editing but especially the video footage.  I would recommend when looking for a new camera that this be one to consider.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony A77", "Author": "dcard", "ReviewID": "R101QRC4CA84UD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best camera ever!!!!!!

Weight wise they said it was a little on the heavy side but still it had a very comfortable grip with a secure feel too it.

Its a big problem if you can't control your shutter speed in video. Anyone konws how to rectify this problem?Using this cam with all the zeiss lenses is great!

(On the other hand in-body image stabilization often allows to take sharper images at lower ISO than, say, D7000 due to longer exposure - due to the image stabilization.)CONS:lens connector is a little loose - all the lenses are tangling, and can slightly rotate - that's the body/connector problem, since it occurs with all my lenses ( SAL1650 2.8; SAL75300, Rokinon 85M-S 85mm F1.4)External flash docking is plastic - my Sony HVL-F43AM flash, which also has plastic stand is loose on it, dangling quite a bit. Sony takes the same price for the flash as Nikon/ Canon flashes, which have a metal stand, and metal docking on the camera, however Sony thinks that loose plastic for the same or slightly higher price will be good enough for its customers;AF/MF push button on the body is too easy and loose, and sometimes I press it unintentionally while shooting.Tiltable display can be tilted forward, however is useless on the tripod self portrait: it can go down, to be obscured with the tripod, or can go up to be obscured with flash.

In the short time I have used it, I am greatly impressed. I shot a couple of local high school football games at night under the field lights. To get a decent shutter speed for freezing the action under these lights, a high ISO is needed. With my Sony A350, I shot at either 1600 or 3200 ISO. With the A77, I was shooting at 6400 and 12800 ISO. There is a fair amount of noise in these images, but given the 24 MP sensor, not as much as you might think. Adobe Lightroom was able to reduce the noise to acceptable levels without much image deterioration. One issue I found was that if you shoot under field lights at high ISOs with the white balance set to Auto, colors can vary greatly. This can be corrected, but it takes a bit of work. It is best to shoot with a constant white balance setting. Even so, I still found a bit of color variation when shooting well lit areas of the field vs shooting in less well lit areas. In daylight shooting with lower ISOs, colors were incredibly good, even with auto WB. One minor issue I found was that my images using a Sony 18-250mm lens had chromatic aberration more often than in my other cameras using this same lens. I believe this is due to the much higher resolution of the sensor being able to register small amounts of chromatic aberration that other lower resolution sensors could not register. I have found that a simple click of the Remove Chromatic Aberration check box in Lightroom takes care of this problem when it occurs.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bravo to Sony for a really nice product", "Author": "Gozzer51 \"<\"))>><\"", "ReviewID": "R2HYRUFYYLTT8P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really well thought out controls.

I am late to the world of photography - having gone back to college and will graduate this spring with my AFA in Fine arts and move on to Photo journalism and Fine Arts next.I really like the feel of this camera.  The A65 had a nice feel too, but I like the heavier more sold construction of the A77.  Right now I'm still learning all the functions.  I'm not sure I like the toggle switch as much as the arrow pad dealio on the A65. Perhaps it will grow on me.  I do like the locations of the buttons, although I am not quite as adept at hitting them as I'd like to be yet.  I am intrigued at the very low iso offerings, but haven't been able to employ them yet either.  I have been taking a lot of photos in a dimly lit theatre setting with a lot of action going on - without a flash.  the higher ISO settings - 1250 does a good job of stopping the action even in the dimly lit conditions.  I am using a 50mm prime lens 1.8 so that helps the process.  I continue to fiddle around to see what I can push in low light conditions with this camera.

They have made the second half of my life a great adventure!", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "4 Star Unbiased Review", "Author": "Kal", "ReviewID": "R1U4UVIBLWQ30S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Prefacing this with I'm not an Expert in photography but can only judge from what appeals to my eye. I've used this camera for around two weeks and this is my entry into DSLR (Or in this case DSLT) from Point and Shoot cameras. My previous camera is an Canon S95. I'm familiar with manual settings and the relationships between Aperture, Focal length, Shutter speed, and the use of ISO settings, etc.On paper this camera boasts a lot of features and for the price it's definitely more expensive than the Canon and Nikon alternatives. You'll be hard pressed to find popular photographers using a Sony although. It might be because they have a wide variety of lenses for the brand they choose or they're just more familiar to them. I didn't have any such caveats and I wanted something that could handle both stills and video and that is what brought me to Sony.I'm a firm believer that cameras do need higher Mega-pixels to achieve great detail especially when viewed on a computer or cropping. The Sony comes in at 24.3 MP and the detail when viewing at 100% is good although I expected more from this. Zooming beyond 100% is unpleasing.The EVF is nice but it has its limitations. It projects onscreen data such as Aperture and Shutter speed but if you turn the camera vertical it's difficult to see the corner edges of the EVF because it's best viewed horizontal. It also does not correctly simulate the adjustments you make to shutter, aperture, etc. Example is how the camera focuses and displays what's in or out of focus. Even at F.22 it still doesn't properly adjust the picture. At such a small aperture everything in frame should be in focus depending on your distance from the objects but the EVF doesn't correctly display this. In the end you have to snap the picture, review it to see if everything in foreground and background is in focus, and then make adjustments and reshoot if it's not to your liking. This defeats the purpose of the EVF in my opinion.16-50mm F2.8 Lens is solidly constructed as you'd hope for a price of $700 ($600 if purchased with camera kit). It has a metal mount, hefty weight, and weather sealed like the A77. The adjustments are smooth and the auto-focus is relatively quiet. I haven't had much success using it indoors and found you need to basically be outside in direct sunlight to get any decent pictures. No success using this for any close-up (macro) imagery either. A major flaw of this lens is that it has no physical stops on the focus ring but it does have a locking mechanism for the zoom which is nice.The noise performance is not that great. I try to do most shooting with ISO on 100 because image quality definitely suffers in my opinion. ISO Performance is terrible but your mileage may vary, I'm just a tad picky and don't like noise and/or grainy photos. The higher ISO (6400 and above) settings are more or less a waste, not something I'd advertise as one of my selling points. I will make note that I'm shooting in Fine JPEG only because my Photo editor doesn't have Sony's RAW format and being an older program it is unlikely to get it.The good thing is this camera can utilize Minolta Maxxum lenses, a legacy lens that this mount is based upon. These lenses were built in the 80s and quality is far superior to most modern lenses and they cost significantly less. I got a 100-300mm lens and was able to get some good hand-held shots even at max focal length. I guess it's the saving grace of this camera for me.I'd like to do some Indoors photographs. An example would be Aquarium photography. I purchased an f/1.8 Lens from Sony to go with this Camera because even in a well-lit indoor environment the A77 struggles and the ISO only introduces unwanted noise or otherwise grainy photographs. I also have multiple large windows and a large patio door that I can open up and let in light. The white walls of my Apartment also help with lighting and yet still this camera struggles.Feel free to check out some of my customer images that I've uploaded.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Daisy \"Life is Good\"", "ReviewID": "R2JG12BSYNGQKL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have for over a year and to be honest am still learning it.

I'm just so impressed at all of the incredible things, that this camera is capable of. I have been using Super Zoom Bridge cameras, for the last 10 years while the advancements of digital cameras that have exchangeable lenses, progressed enough to, no longer  worry [as much], about dust and dirt, getting in the insides. Ten years ago, the prices were stiff, and the constant worry about dust held me back. I felt that, until they really looked into the problem,  and fixed it decently, I didn't want to take chances on a camera such as this .I was also waiting for the prices to come down.That being said, for those that have used a 35mm film cameras with regular and zoom lenses, in their past, should not worry as I did about making a change to a \"Real Digital Camera\".  I quickly found out that, using the camera, for the first time, that the worried feelings I had, were not necessary. I feared that, it would take a long time to get used to this camera's differences. Thankfully, it comes right back to you, just like riding a bike,,,but this time, the bike has JET PACKS and is WAY more fun!First things first - if you too have been using an \"all in one\" bridge camera - this camera is HEAVY! VERY HEAVY! And that is just the body. Add lenses, and it starts to pack on pounds - well not a lot of pounds - but at least 3, with a lens. A good camera strap with a neck cushion is a MUST - or - you can get a sling type strap, that allows the camera to be slung on your shoulder and neck, and hangs upside down - this leaves the camera easily accessible, as it slides up and down the clip attachment on the strap. But you can use a regular neck strap but get a luggage strap cushion and add it to your strap - it will help! A decent bag will also be needed if you have more than one lens and any accessories. I purchased a sling type bag, and it works great.The next thing that I noticed once the battery is charged up - was the clear LCD screen and packed feature menu. It is a bit taxing to get thru at first, but once you learn where things are placed, you can get back to it fairly easily. The menus are a bit confusing - but stick with the manual and do a quick Google search for ANY question that you have - you will have answer right away. Don't be intimidated, the learning curve is not long if you stick with it. The small bit of at first work is worth it! And, if all else fails, just use the smart Auto mode, until you become comfortable with it, and the rest of the settings.Next up that blew me away was - the Electronic View Finder! Or (EVF) OMG!!! Wow - it's like I have NEVER taken pictures before with ANY camera! Yes - it IS THAT impressive! One really nice thing about the EVF, is the eye sensor. It knows when you place your eye up to the view finder, and when you remove the camera from your eye - the rear screen comes up showing you what the lens is seeing at that point. This allows for you to view any picture taken, but it also shows your camera angles in a bigger frame, so you can see the full field of view for sizing up the view, before taking another picture with your EVF as the final guide. Sony apparently has done something groundbreaking with their EVF,  that no other maker uses. and it is noticed as a big plus for me! I really like using the EVF - and that was even after I because used to taking just about every picture for the last 10 years with a full screen! The EVF also has a great level line in the screen so that you can see if your frame is aligned straight -- great idea if you are standing on a hill!Next up, are the features! There are plenty of automatic features - and PLENTY of manual features to play around with. I have not gotten into all of the special things that it can do, as I am still learning about what each setting actually does and how it does it. I will hopefully update my review as I become more acquainted with my new baby!Bottom line - if you are looking to update both your camera,  AND your picture taking experiences, to a higher level. This Sony A77 is a fairly budget friendly feature packed camera for that update.  I highly suggest the Sony A77 -- there is also a newer model for a LOT more money the, Sony A99 and a slightly lower model the Sony A65 - much more budget friendly, and has the same viewfinder! It lacks a few of the frills on the A77 like a different body composition, no upper screen on top of the camera to show settings, and no GPS.Bottom line - the middle of the line A77 fits in exactly where I needed it to fit, and I'm happy that I made the choice!If you are looking to have a camera that has a burst speed fast enough for sports shooting (12FPS), but is still affordable, GET THIS CAMERA - again be warned of the weight! To me though it is worth its weight in gold - I really love it that much, and I am a TOTAL newbie to a world of the SLT cameras - I cannot wait to find out everything that this camera is capable doing, of in my hands -- or what I am capable of capturing, with it in my hands!Read more about the EVF at Sony.com", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sony A77 is a very nice camera.", "Author": "Joel K. \"Joel K\"", "ReviewID": "R1YAOOZNW9DF4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Sony a77  about 4 weeks ago and have been enjoying all the features and the great pictures.

I have no extensive experience with other cameras.  So you may take that into consideration with my review.I will mostly be supporting or disagreeing with what alot of people are saying.This camera came out in 2011, i just bought this in 2014. I felt alot of the online/youtube reviews were slightly misleading. The camera is much cheaper now making it more competitive and they improved they performance with firmware updates.With that said, I love this camera, I had this for a month now. I have been enjoying the learning process of photography. The color in this camera are vibrant. I think anyone who says this camera shoots blurry picture doesn't know what they are doing. Because initially i was having grief, my cousin who is a photographer remedy this.FlashThe flash is really good on this camera, you have to go into the menu to dial it down. And it lights up the room nicely.12 Frame Burst ModeThis mode is sick but I haven't been into that many situations other than jumping photography. Gotta try to catch a sports game.Dancing ScreenThis is another great feature, I don't have to lay on the ground.Delayed EVF and NobsI read about this and i don't think its there with the EVF,  it doesn't bother me. You can also set it to disable the lcd and having the evf turn on without using the eye sensor. The nobs do delay a bit and this is slightly annoying when your trying to adjust real quickly.Auto ModeWhen i'm out an about I do shoot in auto. It's still alittle tricky for me to adjust everything on the fly in M. But when I have time shooting landscape/building or my gf wants to patiently wait. It does the job.Low Light ISOIt can be a bit tough sometimes. I can still occasionly get really beautiful images. I sometimes have to lower shutter speed. I can't put a verdict on this yet because it maybe my skill or my lens.I got the 18-55mm lens with this camera. I ordered body only and wanted to save a bit of money, plus i didn't want the weight of the other lens. What I should of did was get the 50mm prime instead.Manuel FocusWhen you manuel focus it has a red outline which is really neat.To may buttonsThe menu system is setup really well, hit function and you go left and right and choose picture mode, iso, flash, shooting mode (burst, single panorama). Really easy and convenient . And around that they have alot of shortcut buttons that go there directly. I sometimes forget what certain buttons do. But the drive/shoot mode, iso, preview and trash are layed out nicely.Bottomline, this camera shoots very fast and is crisp with vibrant colors. I don't think this is the perfect camera but I feel it's cheaper than the other camera that are similar. I might need to upgrade lens for better low light performance.

I thought the a77 would compare in image quality, as well as allow me to offer video to my clients. However, the noise was extreme and the general warmth in color was gone. Skin tones weren't nearly as nice as my old a700 and the noise was simply not manageable above ISO 800.Maybe I had a defective unit, but I also noticed that black often was lined with bright purple. I photographed a baby in a polka dot dress and half of each polka dot had purple and magenta spots throughout. This was in daylight under the trees so I certainly was not expecting noise on her dress and skin (with lenses 1.4 50mm and a 2.8 28mm)I returned the a77 after a few days and purchased the full-frame a99 at a Sony store. It produces beautiful images and does not have a noise issue. Well worth the splurge.Had the a77 given me images comparable to my old a700, I would have been a lot happier. Unfortunately, I was embarrassed with the images I got off of it and would not dream of using it with clients. I was so disappointed with the image quality that it makes me wonder if I just got a bad unit. Not worth buying a second and hoping for better though.FEATURES:The digital viewfinder is awesome! I loved it right away and have only grown to love it more on my a99. It is extremely useful to be able to see your exposure adjustments in real time. I also love having that screen as a viewing option in extreme daylight.The mobile screen is extremely handy. When I'm using the camera above my head, I can flip the screen and see exactly what I'm getting. It's also useful for photographing babies and young children as they are low to the ground and sometimes laying flat on my belly isn't an option.

So of course I can turn off the flash, but when I need fill-flash, I need to switch it back on and then remember to turn it off again.  For action shots in Auto or Auto+ the A-77 is simply useless because it won't take the photo until it's satisfied with lighting, focus and whatever else the Auto function checks first, but I have completely missed action moments because this camera was still thinking about what to do, a full one or two seconds after I pressed the shutter.  So I have to use it in Manual mode, which rather misses the point of having all those Auto functions and presets.

This was a good theory, but I could not make it work in real life.  My main goal was to be able to shoot pictures of the kids indoors with no flash.  With this lens/body combination, it is generally necessary to shoot the lens at f/2.8 at 1/60 sec and ISO 3200.  The problem is that the lens is not at its sharpest because it's wide open and the noise at ISO 3200 is relatively high.  Therefore, the pictures just don't look that great.  I suppose they would be printable but they just don't look much better than a point and shoot to me.Initially, I thought the problem was that the 16-50mm \"Super Kit\" lens was the problem.  This lens does \"feel\" high quality, almost like a Canon L lens, but it is Made in China, which I take as a negative sign for optical quality.  I then rented a 35mm f/1.8 Sigma prime lens.  This was a bit better (sharper/brighter) but I still had to shoot relatively high ISO 800 to 1000 to get sharp indoor pictures at f/2 or f/2.2.  I could get nothing that I considered sharp and noise-free enough to warrant the purchase of the 35mm lens in addition to what I was paying for the kit lens with the body.From the testing with the supposedly good 16-50mm Sony lens and the 35mm Sigma fast prime lens (also not exactly cheap), I am concluding that the Sony body is not well suited to low light shooting and am returning it.Increasing the in body sharpness to +3 did not seem to make a big difference.  I did not test the image quality using RAW, as that's just too much work for me.  Perhaps that would make a difference.On the plus side, the camera has great quality feel to it.  I like the EVF OLED viewfinder a lot.  It focused quickly and it took pretty good movies with the 16-50mm lens due to the continuous auto focusing and SSM motor (silent during video).  I like the \"instant\" digital/crop zoom feature that zooms in and takes the \"inside\" 6MP of the 24MP image, thereby simulating a 2x zoom factor.If I were looking for a video DSLR, I would possibly keep it.  However much I considered this, I then rejected the idea due to the cost of the Sony 70-200G SSM that you would have to buy for video, as there are no other obvious good options for Sony / Minolta that would be silent and quick focusing.  Perhaps Sigma could do it with their HSM motor lens; I don't know.Probably a good option for many to consider if they are willing to concede some of the indoor light issues with either a flash or tolerating more noise and then buy the inexpensive Minolta lenses that have good optical quality but do not have silent motors (70-210 f4 beercan, 50mm f/1.7 prime, 38mm f/2.8 prime).  The combination of a Sony alpha body with older used lens is very cost effective.Myself, I think I am going to get a used 5D and 24-105mm f/4L lens instead.  Cost is pretty similar to this combination.Good luck!", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not ready for prime time", "Author": "rbtk", "ReviewID": "R362YE6Y98ZK7W", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I love the idea of this camera - I bought it locally to use as a second body with every intention of using its video as well as still capabilities. Fair, or not, I previously used a Canon 5dMII for 2 years and am currently using a Nikon d800e. With that frame of reference in mind, I have to say this camera was a complete disappointment. In fact it is the most disappointing camera I've ever used.The body is good - plastic build, but with tight seams. Nice and compact with a sleek, modern look. I was generally fine with the button layout, after a little time to adjust to the different handling. The grip was adequate - a little on the small side. My biggest issue was that the AEL button was where my thumb naturally rests - this is normally where Nikon or Canon would integrate a thumb hook/rest.The lens was nice for a kit. The zoom was a little rough - it clunks at the end of the tele end. Sharpness was fine. Color rendition and contrast were pretty good. It's way better than your standard kit zoom, but, IMO, lags far behind typical f/2.8 zoom lenses (which is entirely expected given the relative affordability of this lens - most f/2.8 zooms tend to be pro models)The EVF is cool, but flawed. Taking pics in low light was a terrible experience. High noise creeps into the viewfinder and makes framing the shot very challenging with the darkened image. The lag of the EVF turning on is also aggravating. The color rendition of the EVF seemed a little over saturated and it was sometimes challenging to gauge the final output based on what you see through the EVF.Speaking of noise - this is where the a77 massively fails. Objectionable noise creeps in at above ISO 800. It's not pretty noise either - it's clumpy, curdled, watercolor looking noise and lots of chroma shadow noise is also visible. Visible softening is also seen. These can be mitigated via RAW processing, but the compromises that either the translucent lens or Sony's imaging pipeline introduce are just not worth the extra work. You feel like you are never taking advantage of what that sensor can potentially offer.Daytime pics are great - Low ISO pics are wonderful with high detail and great color.Conversely, shooting low light pics at ISO 3200 or above is just a mess - JPGs at this sensitivity were almost unusable. Getting decent exposures was a challenge to say the least.The video performance was fine. The IBIS seemed to introduce some bizarre jello like distortion. That said, the continuous phase contrast AF in video mode was awesome. I love this function and it's the only redeeming feature of this camera. Otherwise, I just don't see the point.I would strongly suggest buying this camera from Amazon or a retailer that offers a locktight return policy - definitely demo this camera and see if it fits your shooting style and subject material before committing. I really wanted to love this camera and I don't have a significant investment in Nikon glass. In fact, I had just switched from Canon not too long ago.

This is done even before the US product is released, indicating an admission to the dissatisfaction of its earlier versions of the firmware. But to Sony's credit, they did it quickly. I updated the rating accordingly.(2) Judging from the DxOMarks which measure the raw performance of the sensor, Pentax K-5, Nikon D7000 and Sony NEX-5N are still the best among the APS-C cameras, each scoring around 1100 for high ISO performance, significantly better than the 800 score of Sony A77. By my standard, even K-5 and D7000 are still shy of giving truly excellent quality ISO 3200 performance, although they are getting close. But the fact that Sony A77 is a step back, instead of a step forward in lowlight performance, is depressing for those who need truly excellent lowlight performance.Technologically, Sony already possesses the capability to make a APS-C camera that has lowlight performance close to what is offered about three years ago by Nikon's full-frame cameras, but they chose not to do so. It is their marketing choice, and I have no right to demand them to change. I just wanted to share my thought.And my thoughts reflect a quite large group of users who are not satisfied with A77. That doesn't mean A77 is not an excellent camera for people who have different uses and preferences. It just means that Sony has not covered an important group of potential buyers. To make it up, Sony will need to either come up with a similar camera with a different emphasis, or use true hardware-based pixel binning to satisfy both camps. There is no indication at this time what Sony has in its mind.Perhaps Fujifilm will come up with something to satisfy that need next year. They already said they will.--THE ORIGINAL REVIEW (or comment):I don't pretend to be writing a full review based on scientific tests. I just wanted to tell you what I think about this camera, Sony A77.Why only a 3-star rating for an apparently brilliant camera?One star off for widely reported firmware bugs (search the Internet please, I'm not making this up).  I will update when the bugs are fixed with a firmware update that is likely being rushed out soon (Sony knows they messed up on this).Another star off for the disappointing lowlight performance. More discussion on the latter below.If the bugs are fixed, Sony A77 would be a five-star camera for those who primarily use it at at low ISO (at or below ISO 800). But it would still not be the right camera for those who need lowlight abilities. For the lowlight performance, A77 is just slightly better than the 4-year old A700, which is supposed to be replaced by A77, and significantly worse than the 3-year old A900, which is not known for its high ISO capability in the same class.Overall, A77 brings superb specifications. Virtually everything at least matches, and in many cases surpasses, competitions (cameras under $1500), be it resolution, speed, viewfinder clarity & coverage, AF performance, and video quality. Also, don't forget that A77 has built-in image stabilization, making every lens mounted to it a stabilized lens getting several stops of advantage.The EVF in the A77 is both exciting and controversial. Some will love it, but some will hate it, and most will probably both love and hate. Although I am fully aware of the disadvantaged of even the best EVF in the world (battery consumption, for example, is an inherent disadvantage which is not going to go away in the future), I believe EVF is here to stay, and is likely to be quickly adopted in the vast majority of cameras. It just has too many benefits, including progressively lower cost, progressively higher quality, plus upgradability, flexibility and expandability.My disappointment is with LOWLIGHT PERFORMANCE which is related to the very high SENSOR PIXEL DENSITY of the camera (the concept is explained in detail at the end of this writing).I am an owner of a Sony A700, and for the last three years have been waiting for a Sony replacement. A77 is supposed to be Sony's long-waited replacement to A700.  But when it has finally arrived, I decided to continue to use my A700.So I am obviously disappointed with A77.Sony wanted to make a camera of class-leading pixel density while maintaining reasonable lowlight performance. They succeeded. They chose a sensor with 24 megapixels, which is class-leading. Based on the early tests, it is virtually noise free at or below ISO 400, very clean at ISO 800, and reasonably clean up to ISO 1600. This is great news for those who primarily shoot at lower ISO only.However, the sensor choice was a compromise which resulted in a level of noise which requires excessive noise reduction beyond ISO 800.As a result, A77 has the following characteristics in terms of image qualities:(1) at or below ISO 400 - A77 is the sharpest and the clearest among ASP-C cameras;(2) at ISO 800 - on par with the best of others;(3) at ISO 1600 - falls slightly below the best of the competition;(4) at or above ISO 3200 - apparently worse than the top competitors despite its higher number of pixels. Essentially the noise cancels out whatever advantages brought by the extra number of pixels.Both the DxOMarks by the DxO Labs and the test results produced by the raw files of A77 with the support of the newest Photoshop Light Room 3.5 seem to support this conclusion, and I don't believe the basic conclusion above is going to change.I'm not suggesting Sony is stupid or has made the mistake. It may very well be a smart decision in terms of marketing. For many, Sony's approach is a good balance and compromise. Particularly, for people who shoot at low ISO only, A77's choice of sensor is ideal because its low ISO performance guarantees it to yield the best image quality in that condition.But I wanted a camera that has a different emphasis and a different character. I need a high ISO performer. This desire is not a mere pursuit of a higher number. It has to do with the kind of photographs I take, frequently under low natural light without flash.I almost never need resolution beyond 12 megapixels. In reality, a clean 12 megapixel photograph is capable of producing excellent poster size pictures. Even if you are hard-nosed to look for visible differences, one would have to make a print larger than 20\"x16\" to see any difference beyond 12 megapixels.  Among the photos I take, perhaps less than one out of every thousand (that's less than 0.1%) may see that kind of enlargement. In contrast, at least 30% of the photos I take are indoors or lowlight outdoors and need good lowlight performance (at least excellent ISO 3200 and usable ISO 6400).So for my own needs, lowlight performance is about 300 times more useful than more pixels (do the math, 30% to 0.1% = 300).Besides, I, and my computer, hate to always carry the burden of the large file sizes which I nearly never need. That in itself is a negative.Based on the tests so far, it seems that the new A77's lowlight performance is comparable to that of a fully updated A700.  The old Sony A700 has a 12MP sensor.  Although it had relatively unimpressive lowlight performance when the camera was first released, subsequent firmware update and RAW processing algorithm advances made some significant improvement. But Sony A700, and now A77, is still about two full f-stops short of perfectly meeting my lowlight needs. Had Sony used a 12MP sensor for A77 and focused on the sensor performance rather than MP, the camera could overcome that shortcoming and would have been the ideal camera fro me. Or even a 16MP sensor would have been a good choice. The 16MP sensor on NEX-5N seems to be doing just fine, and is at least a full f-stop better than A77.Alternatively, had Sony used binning technique to give 6MP and 12MP RAW options with the 24MP sensor, it would have at least partially covered the best of the two worlds.But of course Sony did not do any of the above. Instead, we have the A77 as it stands now.  After four years (which is three generations in digital photography product development cycles), I was expecting significantly better lowlight performance instead of more pixels. Without this improvement, I lose a major reason to update.I'll probably wait for the next full-frame Sony, especially if it is relatively compact with a full frame sensor staying at 24 MP (I would wish it were just 12 MP like Nikon D700, but there is not a chance that Sony would do that). And if they make a very compact full-frame NEX camera with fast AF and no more than 24 MP, that would be for me.Considering that A77 has twice as many pixels as A700 does, Sony has effectively improved its sensor technology's fundamental performance by at least 100%, which is actually a quite significant technological achievement. So this is not saying Sony hasn't been capable in technology development. It's just about an unfortunate choice of emphasis.I know this review is going to be controversial, and will be hated by many. For those who believe the ISO performance of A77 is good enough, that's great.  Apparently, if you don't take photos beyond ISO 800, and if you don't mind handling larger file sizes whether or not you need the large files, A77 it is hard to beat. But for those still do not believe (or simply don't understand) that high MP (high pixel density) leads to poorer lowlight performance, please set aside what you believe to be \"common sense\" temporarily, and read the following, because you may be misunderstanding something fundamental.SENSOR PIXEL DENSITY AND LOWLIGHT PERFORMANCEThere has been a lot of misunderstanding with regard to the relationship between sensor pixel density and low light performance. The problem is that many people think of this as an abstract math problem. In their eyes, having more megapixels on the same sensor should always be an advantage because you can always reduce the number of pixels by downsampling, and as a result the only burden of having more pixels is the file size, a relatively minor thing to complain about. But this understanding is incorrect. The issue of pixel density is not just a math matter. It is a physics matter.First of all, photosites on a sensor have boundaries which are dead zones without any active sensing element to convert light to signals. These boundaries are always minimized as much as possible, but the reduction has a limit for a given technology.The easiest way to understand this issue is to use the following analogy:Suppose you draw a grid on a piece of paper. And suppose the line you draw has a certain width (which may be quite thin, but is not infinitely thin). The more dense you draw the grid, the more surface of the paper is going to be covered by the black lines. If you keep going, your paper would become darker and darker. That's why there is an absolute loss of optical performance when you put more photosites (pixels) on the same sensor of a certain area. (At the same time, more pixels are always desired to achieve higher resolution. So it's a balance.)The reality in the sensor technology maybe a little bit better, thanks to the use of microlenses which collect some of the light that might have otherwise fallen onto the dead zones. But although microlenses are a quite effective solution, they are not a perfect one.Another related issue is light diffraction when the photosites are too small. This affects resolution at small aperture settings. This is a widely discussed topic, although not very easy to understand, but relatively causes less misunderstanding.In addition, at 24 megapixels, most lenses no longer have enough resolving power to materialize the resolution advantage even if there is any at the sensor level.The truth is that getting more pixels isn't just a free math game, it's a war of physics. You lose something absolute in physics.Unfortunately, companies are biased toward increasing the number of pixels because it is the easiest metrics to market. Most consumers don't understand or don't care what affect digital image quality, but everyone understands that 24 as a number is greater than 16, and than 12. Companies know that. It is a cheap good impression to create. It's about marketing.--", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Picture quality is not great compare to Nikon", "Author": "Kenny", "ReviewID": "R1LC290G7O6AON", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I shot this Sony A77 with Sony Zeiss 85mm, 70-200mm, 24-70mm.

But those were the days when Sony meant quality.This one I ordered directly from Sonystyle.com. The sales agents who chatted asked me my experiences on DSLRs. I said 'This is my 1st DSLR'.  The product came very fast. I tried 500-600 shots in 4 days in many lighting / camera setups, jpeg, raw, auto, manual, with various lenses (which give fantastic pictures in other cameras)... NOT A SINGLE PICTURE was clear. ALL the pictures were smeared, including the raw pictures. It was a DEFECTIVE unit. It is not just the compression software. The picture is bad even at unprocessed (before software) stage.How can a defective product leave Sony factory? Is it a used one? Did the sales agents cheat on me by sending me a already returned / defective item (since I told this is my 1st DSLR)? Does Sony have a second market selling factory-rejected items ?? I am getting all these suspicions. I better share with people. I have been using film cameras of very high quality for decades and I make good telescopes myself.

In addition, all of the inside photos had a purple line through them.  The constant live view slows things down a lot and consumes batteries voraciously like candy.  \"Superzoom\" point and shoot camera are effectively the same thing for a third the cost.  Buy one of those and save a $1000 or buy a real SLR from a different vendor.

And its not Nikon, or Canon, its SONY.  Leaving the dinosaur technology of SLR way behind, this is second generation SLT, a significantly better way to compose images artistically.  Someday we'll look back and laugh at how professional photographers thought is was ADVANCED to shoot an SLR, totally unable to see the ACTUAL image they were going to take until AFTER they took it.  SLT changes all that, and Sony has built a true solid professional body around that advanced technology.  SONY won't be the number one professional camera system in the world this year in sales....but if just as many current pros had SONY lenses as Canon lenses, you can bet they WOULD be.

It is in the still picture arena that they have recently entered where they are playing catch up with Canon. Noise has been an issue for Sony. Should they beat this problem with this new camera they will poise a real threat to Nikon's dominance. They could replace Nikon as Canon's chief rival. Nikon uses the Sony Sensor and places it in tough pro oriented bodies. Should the a77 prove to be tough in the field at its given price it will get noticed and used by budget minded pros. The new Sony lenses are a further signal that Sony wants to move up.  As someone who has much invested in a Minolta/Sony system the thought of having to go Nikon or Canon to step up in toughness is chilling.
