I have been a loyal canon fan for a long time.  I bought this camera to replace my previous SureShot that had been reliable for ten years.  My hopes were high, but I had this camera for only three months before it broke.  During the three months it was working, I was disappointed over and over by the SUPER OWL flash which was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bright it completely washed out my pictures.  The auto focus was unreliable.  And now the camera has stopped working altogether: it complains that it needs new battery, but does not respond to replacement batteries.The quality of this camera fell far below my expectations.I would warn anyone away from buying it  =(", "Date": "December 23, 2001"}, {"Title": "Too much flash", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2XS0AVDA43UBY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I found the flash to be too bright, and many photos were out of focus.
