{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Canon EOS 7D review", "Author": "Larry Pound \"LD\"", "ReviewID": "RV3XD7P8SAP2R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We recently purchased a Canon EOS 7D to upgrade from the camera my wife had been using.  We have found the camera to be everything we expected.  It is somewhat heavy and a bit harder for her to handle, especially when using a large lens, but the images are very sharp and the colors vibrant.  The lens that came with the camera kit (28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM) is good, but not outstanding.  It produces good images with vivid color, but does not yield the razor sharp images the L series lenses give.  Fortunately we have some L series lenses, and used with the EOS 7D, the images are truly beautiful.  We find the auto-focus to be good, but not as effective in some conditions as manual focus.  For example, when shooting birds in trees the auto focus often results in soft or even fuzzy images.  Apparently the camera focuses on something other than the target object when in complex environments like that.  That is not a surprise, and we simply switch to manual focus under those conditions.  Also, the image stabilizers in the Canon lenses are excellent.  We've hand held the camera to take zoom photos at long exposure times and had no problem with camera movement.  Overall, the camera is an excellent one and we strongly recommend it.  (We also have a Canon Rebel T2i, and it is a very good camera but not in the same class as the EOS 7D.)It has now been about 6 months since we purchased the Canon EOS 7D, and we are still very pleased with it.  The images are very good, much sharper than our previous camera (an Olympus DSLR.)  I used Olympus cameras for many years, had some of their best glass, but as much as I liked the Olympus I have to admit the Canon EOS 7D produces much sharper images and more vivid colors.  The 7D is a great camera and well worth the cost.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pleased with Camera..not kit", "Author": "Hannah", "ReviewID": "R3L8R3P57VBTBT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After finding the camera and lens that I wanted. I thought it was great to get a 'Canon kit' also but having it arrive the kit was a very poor quality no brand. My bag clip has already broken and the charger was not even compatible with Australia. The tripod was also cheap and nasty and does not hold the wait of my camera being made of very brittle plastic. I was very dissapointed being lead to believe it was all Canon. Also the 'universal' card reader included in the 'deluxe' kit does not even fit the card that the camera uses which is what it was meant for. My camera is great!", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Kit package for D7", "Author": "Craig W. Marston", "ReviewID": "R3B4MB2P3GX3YB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "All the acsessories in this package are poor quality. I complained to the seller and they did send me a bigger tripod and bag. The bag was great, the tripod was just a bigger version of total crap. You would never trust this tripod to hold your HEAVY two thousand dollar camera, That's if you could actually get it to attach. The generic battery has half the life of the canon battery. The card reader prongs bent the first I used it. I use nothing but the charger from this kit, Oh the lens cleaning tissue works well.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "7D = 5+ stars, extras = ZERO", "Author": "Typical American", "ReviewID": "R1D9BKOMV6FAHG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Best camera i've ever owned.  The camera gets 5+ stars. But all the accessories that came with it are all cheap and not really worth a damn.  Even the CF card is the cheapest one out there.  The card works fine, but I like to have one with a higher transfer rate.  The extra battery works, but its not reconized by the camera.  How that happens?  I don't know.  It might be alittle extra to buy all this stuff seperately, but worth it to buy, at least, the mid-level quality accessories.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love my new Canon.", "Author": "I Want one", "ReviewID": "R39RRUUAHKGI7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera itself is amazing. I would rate the camera a five, but the things that came with it were kinda cheap. Like the camera bag has a really cheap feel, and the tripod is super wobbly. I wouldn't trust a heavy camera on that thing.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cannon EOS 70 and Service", "Author": "Sam W.

Not only are the still photos far beyond my expectations, the HD video is near movie quality.  The DVD that accompanied the package was also very helpful.  If you are looking for a high quality camera that is also easy to use, this is the product for you.the service from the vendor is equal to that of the quality of the camera. This company is excellent and most responsive.  I will definitly use both the Canon and the company as much as possible.Sam", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great kit!", "Author": "God Bless America", "ReviewID": "R1W86MSG5E1I7M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We use everything that came with it.
