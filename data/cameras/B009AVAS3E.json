The camera bag is very cheap quality and I purchased a new one.  I also bought this package for the extra $10 to get the full sized tripod and I was very disappointed with it.  Very flimsy.  All in all it is still a great package.  This camera is worth the deal with the extras that are usable.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful", "Author": "Roxie C.", "ReviewID": "R3OKHMQR4GHVJF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For only $10 more than what Walmart wanted for just the camera and basic lens I was able to get everything I needed plus some. Shipping was quick, everything works great is in perfect condition. Would definitely go through this seller again! Highly recommend them.

I found out that the quality of the items isn't the best, but it was nice to have it all when I was first starting out with the Rebel camera, not knowing how serious I would be with this hobby. As time goes on, and I upgrade certain things about my camera/accessories I slowly get rid of the items included in the package. The camera is amazing, everything else you could get by without.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tons of functionaluity...", "Author": "Aaron Johnson", "ReviewID": "R1B47SMKNB4B1U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just about everything you need to start your camera hobby in one purchase!
