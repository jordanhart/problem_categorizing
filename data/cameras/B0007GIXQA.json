My daughter has a Kodak Easy Share camera and I had played around with it some, but I wanted an easy camera of my own.  After doing some research and comparing I decided to go with the Finepix A345.This camera has a lot of features, yet it was easy to learn how to use it.  I had to get used to mastering the Auto Focus feature.  Some of my shots came out blurry if the camera couldn't auto focus.  If you are too close to your subject or not holding the camera still it will flash an AF! warning which means it can't auto focus.  Most of my prints have come out great, very clear and with great coloring.I have taken this camera to a concert and was very pleased with the Optical Zoom feature.  I got closer shots that I could have gotten with my film camera.  I used the Action mode and got some pretty good shots considering how far back our seats were.  I've also taken this camera to an aquarium while on vacation and was very pleased at how my prints turned out.I also like the size of this camera.  It's small without being too small.  I like the large LCD screen as well.  The price was also right.  The Amazon price was about $20 cheaper than Target or Best Buy.  I also bought a 128 MB XD card.  The 16 MB card that's included only holds about 20 pictures.My only complaint about this camera is that I couldn't get the software to load correctly on my home computer.  I have Windows XP and from what I've read from other Fuji camera reviews, sometimes the software can't be loaded without calling technical support.  I just haven't took the time to do that yet so I go through \"My Computer\" to up load the pictures.  That works perfectly so I may not even fool with the software.I gave this camera 4 stars because I am basically pleased with this camera.  However, this is my first digital camera so I don't have anything to compare it to.  But for a beginner camera I think it's great.", "Date": "July 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "It serves it's intended purpose well", "Author": "northernbound", "ReviewID": "R113ZQBCI4Q1SB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned probably 15 digital cameras over the past several years, this is my sixth fuji finepix.  My other digital camera (that I currently own) is a DSLR and I am a photographer by trade so I'm quite possibly a little spoiled by the BETTER cameras that I've owned.With that said, I wanted a cheap (around $100) camera that I could stick in my purse and take everywhere, a camera that even (GASP!) my husband was allowed to touch.  This camera fit the price guidelines so I bought it.First of all, it's small.  VERY small.  It is perfect for that in the purse/glovebox camera.  It takes AA batteries which can be found at any backwoods bait store if needed.For indoor shots, it lacks.  Yes, it can take a picture that is in focus (sometimes) but it's often over or under exposed.  The macro mode is worthless because you have to be around four feet away from an object before the camera will focus on the subject.  For me, this is really a non-issue because when I'm at home, indoors, I'll use my GOOD camera.For outdoor shots, this camera shines.  Crisp, sharp pictures with little effort.  The processor in this camera produces rich, vibrant colors.  This is especially noticeable in the bright blue skies.In conclusion, if you are looking for a cheap, SMALL digital camera to take along on vacation - this fits the bill perfectly.  If you are counting on this camera to preserve your precious memories of your family, taken mostly indoors, I'd look elsewhere.", "Date": "January 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!!!", "Author": "Delee \"Debz\"", "ReviewID": "R1HDKEVN0AZ6LF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera back in July and I love it. some people complain about clarity and i get great shots. You truly have to know how to set any camera to get the picture you want. you can't take a picture in the dark with no flash right? so in other ward you need to change settings to get clear pictures. that's with any camera. about the battery life. i was using regular batteries at first that lasted oh about a week. then I found some digital camera kind for $10 at target and haven't had to change the battery since then. i even got concerned thinking maybe i changed the battery and forgot, but no sill have the whole pack left and its been 3 months and i use my camera almost ever weekend.

So I hope that I know what I'm talking about.I bought this camera at best buy during chrismas season of 2005. Before buying it, I compared it to an olympus 900 and a Sony S60. In the end, I went for this one (obviously). After  fumbling with it for 2 days, I have to say- It's pretty good.After further research, I am still semi happy about my choice- the olympus downright sucks (according to cnet) and the Sony...well, let's just say it is more complicated than I expected it would be.One thing that I do wish this camera had was the ability to capture movies at \"TV MODE\", which is at 600 by 500 or something pixels, and to do it at 30 frames per second. This camera could do it at a max of 300 something by 200 (see the specs at the top). Really, the movies do look good but if you view them fullscreen on a PC they look bloated and choppy. The Sony can capture better at the same price.But a digital camera is supposed to take pictures, right?This is where the camera excells in. I don't know howthe other reviewers could say that the image quality is bad, but all I can say is that from where I live here in Washington, the pictures come out nice and beautiful.How does it look from your state?Generally, this is a good camera for the average casual person. I'm planning to get a better one for my family (likely something from Sony) this spring though. But what can I say? This one do offer satisfactery shots in a small package.Be warned however, this is not the most durable camera on the market. Its left side sports 3 uncovered and open areas: USB, Video out and Power ports which are totally out in the open. So don't accendentally spill water on that side. Proberly not good when taking pictures in the rain either.And do get recharable batteries. My first set lasted me 20 shots, although it says that the camera can do around 100 on one set.256 mb memory card is also recommended. Everyone says that they're cheap. I don't know how $30 sounds cheap. But you'll need them.That's it!

So far i have LOVED the little thing. *It fits great in my purse and i can take it anywhere with me.* If you are looking for a good camera for generic pictures then this is the camera for you. Latley Ive been gettin more into photography and even tho this little camera isnt the best for taking complicated shots it really isnt bad. The zoom is great for the price, EASY to use, GREAT photo quality. If I had to make the choice again Id definantly choose this one.

Lakes", "ReviewID": "RMXHM819Z19UI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to take with me to Europe because I was studying abroad.  The day after I bought the camera I was trying it out and it \"froze\" after the flash went off.  No picture came up on the screen and the camera wouldn't turn off or anything.  So, I had to take the batteries out and put them back in before it would turn off.  Well, I was leaving for Europe a week later so I didn't have time to deal with sending it off.  So, I took it with me.  I continued to have problems with it.  The \"freezing\" continued to happen, but I also started experiencing another issue.  Sometimes when I turned the camera on the lense would not come all the way out, like it was stuck.  And when you look through the view finder the picture is completely blurred.  So you would have to turn the camera on and off hoping that that would fix the problem.  Well, my camera survived 9 countries and took great pictures.  I was never caught without being able to take a picture, it may have just taken longer than I would have liked.  Once I was home I plugged up my camera to my computer and the dreaded words \"communication error\" popped up on the screen of the camera and a message popped up on my computer screen telling me there was something wrong with whatever I had just plugged in.  That was the last straw.  I mailed off the camera yesterday (at my own expense) and I am waiting to see what Fuji is going to do.  I am very disappointed with the camera and will not purchase another Fuji.", "Date": "March 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "it's not worth your time, money or frustration", "Author": "Melissa Pens", "ReviewID": "R52NTXZGQYSG4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm surprised to see so many positive reviews for this camera. I had their older version and absolutely loved it. When that one died I decided to go with the same company despite some warnings from a friend who had bought this version. I just figured he had gotten a lemon. I guess not. This camera rarely works. Currently the lens won't even open... it just makes a weird sound and won't do anything. It has never worked properly for me. Half the time the shutter won't open. Often the camera refuses to do anything rather than just *look* at the pictures... it won't let me take any. More often than not the camera won't be recognized by any computers (I work in a computer lab and try it on several different ones) even though I've bought replacement connector cords. The pictures are usually blurry and I have to take them several times even though I steady the camera on tables, etc. Don't even think about taking photos inside with this camera. Everything is dark. What you see in the screen (as well as the peep-hole thing that I always use) is not what you will see in the pictures. You have to think about whether to zoom in more or less in order to get what shot you want. The picture quality is alright if it's just for home use, but, especially when compared to the previous version, is horrific for any sort of specialization. I tried to take some pictures of jewelry I had made but not only could I not get a shot that was not blurry or dark but the colors were all off. I've found that every single photo I want to keep from this camera I have to take into Photoshop to fix the brightness and the colors. I have to take a lot of photographs of various materials, so you can imagine how annoying that is to have to take each and every one into another program to fix. The salesman who sold this to me was trying to press another camera. At the time I thought he was just trying to sell me a more expensive camera, but now I wish I would have taken his advice. What's the use of having a camera if most the time you can't use it and when you actually can it gives you a terrible product? My friend has all the same problems and we're both incredibly unhappy with this camera. They had me as a lifelong Fujifilm camera buyer before but no longer. I'll never buy one again. I hate this camera. Today I had to take three pictures but it won't open.

My friend has the A350, and I was always hogging it, so I decided to get my own, but for a better price.

It's easy to learn how to use, and anyone could use it.  I am totally in love with this camera, and if I had the chance to buy another camera instead of this one, I definitely would not.  It's the best thing you could ever buy for yourself photo-wise.My only tip: buy good batteries.  This one goes through them quickly, though having AA batteries rather than the traditional kind that you have to charge makes this camera a snap, and you don't have to wait hours and hours just to take a few pictures.Well done, Fujifilm.  5 Stars.

Howe", "ReviewID": "R1MJDEFZH2O6DV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really liked this camera for the first 6 months I had it. It's small, easy to use, and takes good quality photos. The indoor photos were vastly better than with the blinding flash of my old Olympus digital. I can see why it's getting 5 stars from so many people.But after 6 months, the trouble began. The lens didn't pop out consistently when the camera turned on, and I had to keep turning it off and on until it popped out, which it did about 25% of the time. In addition, the viewfinder looked blurry, like the lens was out of focus. Not happy-making, but oh well, I thought, at least it's under warranty. I mailed it in to Fuji (at my own cost, which I thought was a little shabby), and got it back after three or four weeks. Nothing had changed! It had EXACTLY the same problems as it did when I sent it in. As far as I can tell, all they did was polish the exterior and pop it back in the box. So I have sent it back to Fuji and am awaiting the results. (Not that they apologized when I called to report the problem, either.)I'm not buying another Fuji very soon after this. Beware not only the possibility of experiencing the same technical problems I did, but also the incompetence of the Fuji service dept.!UPDATE: After receiving it back STILL not fixed, I called and complained, wrote them a nasty note, mailed it back, and finally received a brand new replacement from them.

You will always find someone selling Fuji films, and therefor my logic went that he/she maybe able to help me if I ran into a problem.The good thing about the camera is its size. I can slip it into a tiny purse and carry it with me. Other than that, the quality of the pictures are not all that great, and neither is it easy to navigate the menu. Many times I find that the pictures are not clear, and I have had others use the camera, and they too got the same results. I also find it a bit cumbersome to get the camera ready for a shot, you have to slide and let it click twice before the lens opens. Also, sometimes when you do not slide the lens cap properly, you end up draining your battery. I am not fond of the button or lever, or whatever you want to call it, to zoom in and out.Shop around, and see if you can get another camera.

This one is not.First, the atrocious indoor pictures: I happen to consider the flash my natural enemy, and this has never been a problem with my previous FujiFilms, but it is with this camera. Eventhough I have it set to no flash, every once in a while it'll reset itself to autoflash, and I don't discover that until I've lit up a whole no-flash-photography venue.Second: battery life. I think all in all the battery will last maybe two hours without the screen on, but it starts complaining about it like 10 minutes after you put in new batteries, no joke. It'll shut itself down occasionally claiming it doesn't have enough battery life to operate. I forget about it, and a couple hours later turn it on, and it'll operate for another hour. If it's battery was so low it had to shut down right then, why am I able to have it on for another hour? Just for reference, I had to change the battery in my last camera (a FinePix 2650) once every couple months. I change the battery at least once a week.Its power use is really the worst part of it. As alluded above, it plays silly games about the status of its battery. Sometimes it won't turn on (presumably because the battery is \"dead\"), only to turn on and work flawlessly a few hours later. I never know when it's going to work. It is completely unrealiable.Don't even get me started on the delay between pressing the button and the actual taking of the picture. It's only a second or so, but life moves pretty fast, and that second is important.When I get the money, I'm replacing this camera with its predicessor (the aforementioned FinePix 2650).
