He asked me a few days after I put them up if they could see what's going on across the street. I have them installed under the eaves of my garage and front door. I said yes and he was concerned that the police would ask for footage! I assured him that I won't provide the footage unless they ask for it. He's been a \"good boy\" since!", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice design, but cheaply made.", "Author": "Pat Etzwiler", "ReviewID": "R1IUJ97OI846FS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not to happy with the quality. Cheaply made with thin easily broken plastic. Motion sensor quit working within a few days. But, for the price...you get what you pay for. Seem to be doing what I wanted them to do. We have 6 \"live\" cameras on the property and added these two \"fakes\" to cover another area too far away from the wireless network.

These with the addition of the stickers placed on our battery box solved that problem. My only gripe would be the LED that flashes. The batteries don't last more than a few weeks and to replace them you must first climb the ladder, then hang upside down and try to remove a tiny screw without dropping it. Not worth the effort, so ours no longer blink but they still seem to be fooling people.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good investment", "Author": "Visa \"catman43\"", "ReviewID": "R2W95ETUJZXZS0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "These fake cameras look real and do the job,nobody can tell that they are not real since they are installed at the top corners of my house.
