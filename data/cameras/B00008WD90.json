Got it when they were first released.  My wife dropped it on the tile floor and broke the lens.  While I do have my Samsung Galaxy, nothing beats a real camera for Reports.  Even though I could buy any camera I want, the perceived extra quality would make no difference at all.  I think I'll get another one and keep it on the shelf!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "little metal jewel", "Author": "Chase", "ReviewID": "R7PAYTS9IPEL0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this camera from olympus is made mostly by metal not like todays cameras made of plastic they feel like toys they give you more megapixels but inferior lenses..believe it or not the lenses are the key for crystal clear pics and the camedia comes with the best optics in the business, i have the full line of olympus camedia type cameras and they all shoot wonders.", "Date": "June 17, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Olympus CAMEDIA C-750 Ultra Zoom - Digital camera - compact - 4.0 Mpix - optical zoom: 10 x - supported memory: xD, xD Type H, xD Type M", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31YMH5wRUTL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00008WD90"}}
