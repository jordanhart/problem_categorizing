{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony's Latest \"Bridge\" Camera", "Author": "Ray \"A Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R16HCTB3QOV9MI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sony DSC-H50 Cybershot camera has generated significant interest in the photographic community for a number of reasons. First, there is the ever-present hope that this new model may move us closer to that \"gold standard\" camera of our imagination, the point-and-shoot camera that rivals DSLR performance in terms of picture quality, containing a single lens that spans all the way from a true wide-angle to high telephoto range, with good overall performance, customizable features, and low weight. Then, there is the large, bright, and articulated screen that so many photographers desire, yet is strikingly absent from most recent models. And, of course, there is the interest always garnered in the technology upgrades that new models typically possess, such as support for ever-larger memory cards, more sophisticated processor algorithms, and improved photographic features that help make everyday photo-taking easier and more successful.After owning this camera for a few days, I can report that from the usability standpoint, the DSC-H50 is a gem. The camera is lightweight, easy to hold, and has a comfortable grip. Sony's implementation of a bright, clear, articulating 3-inch LCD screen makes the camera particularly easy to use, and only a short time using the camera is required to find that the camera's shape \"works.\" Controls are laid out in clear, easy to understand manner, and users of previous Cybershot models will recognize the trademark Sony approach to controls on point and shoot cameras. A new, self-explanatory menu system explains each menu option, and the system is mastered in short time. The camera feels solid and well-built in spite of its light 15-oz. weight. Beyond the normal rotary knob that places the camera in its various modes, a number of dedicated buttons control image playback, burst mode, slideshow mode, and \"night shot\" mode.Picture quality also appears to be generally good. The DSC-H50 may be of interest to more demanding photographers who are looking for a secondary camera when not wishing to lug around a full set of lenses and a DSLR, albeit with a necessary amount of post processing to remove sensor noise and the chromatic aberration that appears in some shots. Macro performance is excellent, and the \"Steady Shot\" technology appears to work well. It is important to remember that this camera, though having a full 15x telephoto lens, is not a \"true\" wide-angle lens, with the wide end only reaching 31mm. Nevertheless, this is wider than most point and shoot cameras, with only a very few select models reaching the 28mm width so usefulfor landscape and close-up group shots. The DSC-H50 is a coated Zeiss Vario-Tessar, and seems well suited to take high-quality shots, as long as one understands the limitations of the unit.The camera is designed to make general point and shoot photography very easy, and the camera certainly meets those goals. There is automatic scene detection, face detection, ISO detection, and many other features that will appeal to the typical home user. When shooting in automatic mode, the camera produces good quality images that will satisfy the average user. From my preliminary results, it looks as though the DSC-H50 will make happy a large number of users who are looking for this type of a camera.There are also a few other unusual \"plusses\" for this camera. First, the camera comes standard with a wireless remote control, which is almost unheard of. And the remote control is not a simple shutter release control: you can do almost anything you can do by holding the camera, including using the menus, with this remote. Next, the camera comes standard with a lens adapter, which in the past has been a $30 or $40 accessory necessary if you wish to use add-on lenses. Further, both a wide-angle and an additional telephoto lens are available for the camera. And last, but certainly not least, Sony has finally adopted a small and lightweight battery charger that does not use the cable-and-brick approach, but rather, plugs directly into a wall socket. All of these are welcome additions to the camera.PROS- Very good optical lens range, from somewhat-wide (31mm) to 15x zoom (465mm)- Generally good image quality- Excellent macro performance- Effective image stabilization- Outstanding, pivoting 3\" LCD screen- Feels solid and well-built- Lightweight- Good ergonomics- Full set of customizable photographic settings- Extrememly bright flash (strongest I've seen on a point-and-shoot)- Intuitive, redesigned user interface/menu system with descriptions- Can use up to 16Gb Memory Stick Duo- Very easy to use, even for novice users- Comes with remote control and other accessories- Both super zoom lens and wide-angle lens are available accessoriesCONS- Not quite wide-enough short end (only 31mm, not 28mm)- Small sensor makes noise both inevitable and present, even at low ISO levels (noise reduction can be adjusted in-camera)- Chromatic aberration/purple fringing under certain conditions- No true HD video (compare Panasonic DMC-TZ5)- No RAW mode (but commonly missing now in \"bridge\" cameras)- Camera carrying case not included- Can turn camera on with lens cap in place, allowing lens to push into lens cap; lens cap also pops off occasioanllyIn summary, this lightweight camera with loads of features, generally good picture quality, and aggressive pricing makes the DSC-H50 appear to have hit all the major marks quite well, particularly for the average user who wants to shoot decent pictures with little effort.", "Date": "May 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera", "Author": "T. Riley", "ReviewID": "R2JKWGUPB8KUJU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, so I originally had a Sony Mauvica digital camera. That was my first taste of Sony camera's. My husband and I decided that the Carl Zeiss name was enough to invest in a camera. That camera was amazing. I then went to the Sony Cybershot DSC-W80 because I wanted something smaller and those little bitty pocket cameras came out from everywhere. That is a good camera as well, but nothing like the mauvica and especially this H50. I was a little worried buying this camera because it had so little reviews out there. I'm glad I did. It's really great. The zoom feature is wonderful. I have children and we really need a good zoom for their school concerts and musicals. I have tried this zoom in every atmosphere I can think of. It does so good outside. The steady feature is great because I don't always have a steady hand. Inside in low light, the zoom is good and doesn't look too grainy on the computer unless you zoom into the picture really close. Good for printing 8 x 10's. I haven't tried anything over that.The portrait mode is fabulous. I love taking close up pictures of flowers, the kids and animals with this.The new smile detecting feature is really cool. I didn't really think it would work, but it does. I tried this by having my kids not smiling and then waiting a second to smile. It does seem to detect a smile. There is a setting you can change to detect smiles, low, medium and high. It is suppose to have an editing feature to be able to add smiles after you take the picture... I couldn't get this to work. If I do get it to work, I will add more later.The editing program that this camera has is very cool. You can change the photos you've taken to black & white and the other basics like red eye and sepia also, but it has an option to select one object to stay in color and put the rest of the picture in black and white. It's a really cool feature in my opinion. There are other effects also like blurring everything around one center item. I posted some pics that I took and edited. I will also say that once you upload those pics to Amazon, they lose a lot of their quality.One of the reasons I love sony cameras is because it has a night shot option. It's infrared and lets you shoot in complete dark areas. You can also record video in night shot. I have used night shot in the past with a Sony camera when I couldn't use a flash and it worked great in Disney's \"It's a Small World\" ride.Another cool feature is when you view your pictures, you can do so with music. Now what I like about this is you can upload your own songs to the camera from your PC.There is a noise reduction feature that lets you automatically set to low, medium or high. This is a great feature once you learn what you need to use. It eliminates a lot of the grainy photos.I can't say enough about face detection, it makes photos of people turn out better. It has no problem detecting faces for me.The LCD screen comes out and tilts. I really don't know what I will use that for, I wish that it would turn around for self portraits.It comes with a lens hood, I have to admit that I haven't even tried using this yet.I hope I have listed enough to tell you about the features of this camera. I usually look at user reviews as well as professional ones to determine what camera I purchase. There is more to talk about, but for the semi-novice user that I am, I feel like these are some important qualities. Overall, I believe this is well worth the money. I do believe it will come down in price after time, just like everything else. Next to a DSLR, this is a camera worth having.", "Date": "May 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "So far....", "Author": "XtraBlu", "ReviewID": "R2PPJ3WUNZY2DR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "...I'm ambivalent about this camera.  I loved the earlier version (the DSC-H2) which I'm still using, but decided to replace it because the viewfinder isn't working well.About the camera:I bought the camera to have an all-purpose camera light enough to take backpacking (which my digital SLR with it's lenses isn't).  It's a little bulky, but light (although it feels sturdy) and it's versatile enough to take long-distance wildlife shots or macros of flowers in virtually the same moment.The camera takes very good photos, but is not a huge change from the earlier version of this camera, even though it has half again as many megapixels.  If the ISO is left on auto, as it is when using the fully automatic modes, I find the photos can be noisy, which may be part of the problem other reviewers are describing. I recommend using the adjustable settings, like the \"P\" program and setting the ISO on 80 or 100 to keep noise level to a minimum, especially in outdoor light.  This camera has settings for in-camera noise reduction, which I don't use since I prefer using computer software for noise removal if it's necessary.  This series of camera excels at outstanding macros.  The image stabilization works well on the zoom, and long distance photos taken with the zoom are generally very good.The menus are very easy to see and navigate, in fact I've barely read the instruction manual because it is so self-explanatory. The DSC-H50 offers some manual controls including shutter and aperture settings, which is great for more advanced users. The optical viewfinder mirrors the view through the lens and is clear and sharp enough to compose a photo, or to make sure you got the optimum shot. Many cameras are doing away with their optical viewfinders, much to the detriment of outdoor photographers. It can be hard to compose a decent photo in bright sunlight using an LCD alone. However, the LCD on the DSC-H50 is large and bright, and can be positioned up or down, which is nice when taking a photo at an awkward angle or close to the ground.  Unfortunately, it does not swivel or enable storage with the LCD hidden.  The display seems quite vulnerable to damage as the glass surface is exposed all the way to the corners and is not recessed at all.I don't understand why point and shoot cameras have gotten away from offering a choice of image formats instead of only jpeg.  No matter how many megapixels the camera is, you will still end up with artifacts related to jpeg compression.Main issue:What really bothers me about this camera and the biggest reason for the 3 star review (it would get 4 otherwise), is that Sony made the accompanying ring/hood in a non-standard size (74mm).  The newer flared end design of the filter ring is an improvement over the old ring, since it means no lens vignetting at wider angles, but it seriously irritates me that Sony couldn't have made the opening to fit a standard 72mm filter.  This means that the reasonably priced Hoya or Tiffen filters will not fit, and that you must buy the costly Sony brand ($90-$100 for a polarizer) if you want a filter on your camera.  I tried the inferior quality 74mm Opteka filters (apparently hastily made just for Sony), and the polarizer came apart while I was cleaning it to put on the camera.  Faced with the prospect of buying pricey, odd-sized Sony filters for a point and shoot camera, especially when indications are they may not fit future models, I managed to find a $7 off-brand 74-72mm step down ring (made by Bower for Sony products), which is supposed to fit the Hoya filters I just ordered (about $40 for both). The $120 Sony telephoto extension I bought for my DSC-H2 camera a year and a half ago is completely useless for the DSC-H50, which is a further irritation.Sony's apparently increasing level of specific and non-interchangeable accessories will make me think twice about buying Sony cameras in the future.  They make a good product, but I won't buy from them if I am forced to purchase a whole new set of accessories every time they update a model.  I was unable to find the specs about the end sizes of the hood and ring for the DSC-H50 prior to purchase, but there was no reason to assume that the opening of the ring would be anything but standard.  I thought I'd be able to incorporate the accessories I had already purchased for my DSC-H2 by using step-up step-down rings, which are easily available, as long as the diameters are standard sizes, which was the case with the DSC-H2.Also, as of the date of this review, Amazon's technical specification information on this product is pitifully inadequate, even though I gave them feedback regarding their lack of usable information at least two weeks ago.  I had to go to the B & H photo website to get some decent specs on this camera, and probably would have bought it there, if Amazon hadn't been $20 less expensive with free shipping.", "Date": "June 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Everything I dreamed of", "Author": "Annie C. Boyd", "ReviewID": "R3Q6IOCCD6ES1Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was described to me as a \"bridge\" camera.  It is not a point and shoot, and not an SLR.  It is a bridge between the two.  And, for my money, better than both.  Shutter speed, focus points, macros... and my favorite feature is the battery charging mechanism.One doesnt have to plug in the camera, rather you simply place the battery in a simple cradle that plugs easily into any outlet... even those with little space.  Its a quick charge, and works for hours.  I never went past full charge in all of my 300+ photo shoot.My other favorite feature is the pivoting LCD screen.  You wouldnt think you would depend on it so much at first, but the second you flip it up to see what you're shooting while low to the ground, and you'll understand perfectly.  It helps immeasurably when it comes to close quarters or awkward locations.The 15X zoom is powerful.  Of course, I'm coming off of a 6X zoom, but this picked up kites over 3/4 of a mile away with absolutely no blur.  It was beautiful.In the end, this has to be one of the most powerful and easy to use cameras I've ever used.  A great buy!  I do not regret my purchase at all", "Date": "June 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing lens, Spectacular photos, easy to use!", "Author": "sharkychick", "ReviewID": "R1TMJC4O435WTH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really surprised at a couple reviews I've read here that state this camera takes poor photos and/or is difficult to use.  I am NOT a pro, not even close, but I love shooting pics and I just go gaga over a spectacular photo.  In the short time I've had this camera I have taken quite a few spectacular photos and I could not be more pleased.I also wanted to speak to the issue of weight.  I've seen a couple of reviews on this camera that it feels light and cheap.  I absolutely do NOT find that to be true.  It has a nice, substantial weight in my opinion.I don't think I've shot a bad pic, even one time that I accidently hit the button shooting an unintended pic in my living room the first day.It isn't even necessary to use manual settings to get a beautiful picture.  I just wanted to start shooting, then figure out the more involved stuff after getting used to the basics.  For the last few days I have shot almost everything on an auto setting for just that reason.This is my first Zeiss lens and I just have to say - WOW!  I love how wide this lens is also.  I wasn't used to that with my previous Sony (I am a Sony girl and this is my fourth Sony digi cam).  I also have had exceptional results with the zoom.  The level of stabilization actually shocked me.  No bad pics yet!  I think that by the time I take the time to figure out all the manual settings I will be shooting like a pro.Over all, this is just a wonderful camera for both the amateur and the  experienced shooter in my opinion.  I have taken some pretty decent pictures in my day, but nothing like what I can do with this camera.  The level of clarity, ease of getting a focused shot without even using one of my tripods, and level of stability when super-zooming are all qualities of this camera that I have not experienced with any previous digital camera.", "Date": "June 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "This is one spectacular camera", "Author": "KindlePad", "ReviewID": "R2RWJJ7MQ2K95U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my eye on this camera for a while.

I was actually still quite happy with the H1, more than 3 years after buying it, but a couple of features on the H50 made me invest in the new model:* The camera can be operated through a remote control. In addition to self-portraits, this is good for leaving your camera somewhere on its own, pointing to a place you think an interesting animal, insect or something will appear, and then shoot. It's difficult to get close to animals and insects in person sometimes.* The camera has a screen on the back that can be tilted at various angles, making it good for taking photos from high above your head and conveniently also from ground level. I find this option often makes for creative photography!Just a quick note on the \"smile detector\". It works beyond belief! I'm not sure how useful it actually is, but it's amazing how quickly the camera responds when the smile appears.On the minus side, I would have preferred to be able to continue using normal AA batteries, like in the H1. While the proprietary Sony battery for this camera has impressive endurance, it is also expensive...Another negative, although it may be that I just haven't learnt to operate the camera properly yet, is that until now I find that my macro photos when I go EXTREMELY close actually turns out better/more detailed/cleaner on the H1 than with the H50. It's still good, though.I remain satisfied with the Sony megazoom cameras!", "Date": "July 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Some tips on how to get better photos with DSC H 50", "Author": "Ram Praveen Subramony \"Remo Rulz\"", "ReviewID": "R2WNWTU0FQ6EYX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, this camera and review is meant for those people who want to control the shots they create and tell the camera what to do. My review is not about AUTO mode. If you want to shoot in AUTO mode after getting such a high end camera which offers full manual control over your shot, you are humiliating your photographic skills and your camera. If all you are gonna do is shoot in AUTO mode, you can get any $100 camera for your purpose.I am not getting into all pluses and minuses since all that have been explained by many reviewers.Few points to note while taking snaps under various conditions to get best results:Day Light: Use the supplied lens hood. It will reduce stray flare and protect the lens from direct exposure to sunlight to some extents and prevent your photos from being over exposed.Low light: This is one area where people tend to get bad pictures and they blame the camera for that. Put in small efforts and you can get nice benefits. Use manual mode and fix the aperture value at the maximum say at f2.8 or so. Then slowly, optimize the shutter speed until you get decent exposure. A great advantage is that you can actually preview the likely outcome prior to taking the picture. You may like to change the sensitivity as well. Keep the ISO below 400 preferably. There are specialized modes for taking water side scenes and landscapes in low light without using flash. You can try that as well.Portrait: Use the portrait mode as beginning option which is very good and provides a shallow depth of field with tight focus on subjects. The, you may want to change the metering mode and convert to manual once you are comfortable with the controls.Macro: One of my favorite modes where this camera does wonders. This is one area where the photographer relies on the lens quality more than anything else. And H-50 will not disappoint you(Refer to my uploaded images).Clouded day: You may use ISO mode or manual/semi-manual modes to get good photos without flash.These are the main types of photograhy I have done so far and I am fully satisfied with the results.Experiment with the manual controls for a while before you go on any shooting trip. You can start with the aperture control mode, then the shutter release control mode and then move on to full manual mode. I am no photography expert and before this camera, all I had was a sub 200 dollar P&S.; Trust me when I say that you can discover and learn much more than your expectation with this highly self explanatory 'in camera descriptions' that provide you more than sufficient information as and when you browse modes.I have uploaded the images that I have taken with this camera. No images have been processed through any image upgrade software. They have been uploaded exactly as they shot. Expect much more quality since they compress the pic at Amazon which results in image quality reduction. I have uploaded low light shots as well as macro shots to get a fair idea of the camera's capability at high ISO as well as macro focus range.The camera is a tool that provides all features and unless you use them correctly, you are not going to get good shots. I can get more than worse shots out of a $7,000 SLR if I do not use it correctly. Remember it is always the photographer and not the camera.", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!  I'm in Love!", "Author": "C. Ragsdale", "ReviewID": "R6SUSJG3M9QX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera.  I was trying to decide between a Canon PowerShot Pro Series S5 and this sony.  My mother owns the canon, so I got to see how BEAUTIFUL the pics were and how great the camera was.  But in the end I went with Sony.  This is my first Sony cam, and I am SO GLAD I went with it.  The canon DOES have more options, but the sony is great for ease of use, the menu is easier for me to navigate.  The face detection and smile detection DOES work, which shocked me quite frankly!  I think the pictures from my sony are very crisp and colorful.  More so than my mother's canon seems to be.  This could be from lack of proper setting on the canon I suppose, but again, we come to the ease of use.  I'm no dummy where cameras are concerned, but I'm far from expert.  The shutter speed on the canon was lacking quite a bit.  This sony is much faster snapping shots and I am getting the shots I want when I want them with very little fiddling with the camera!

Many pictures are simply unusable. My old Sony DSC-S90 took better pictures - better color, better clarity, less noise. Every once in awhile I'll get a nice shot, and I wonder - how did that happen? I haven't touched the controls - I left the camera on automatic.Taking several shots in a row of the same subject produces different results - some are noisy and others slightly blurry, while still others look great. When viewing the pictures at actual size, blurry and noisy results are even more pronounced. At times, I get an annoying \"Processing\" message for awhile and the camera refuses to take another shot. I guess this is referred to as \"lag time.\" Well, I can understand 2 seconds of lag time, but sometimes I literally have to wait for almost 10 seconds!I've tried other settings, as well, such as Noise Reduction, Color selection (i.e. \"Vivid\"), EV adjustments, etc. I've also lowered the resolution to 5 megapixels and to 3 megapixels. Still not impressed. My friend has a Canon that clearly takes better photos, and he joked at how his pictures were better than mine and his camera's over a year older (and cheaper.)I suspect the problem is in the compression of the pictures to JPEG. I would much rather have Sony save full size pictures and let me compress them with my own software than have the camera automatically do it for me. Yes, I know that takes more memory, so I'll buy a bigger memory card - I don't care! The only thing I can't understand is why the compression on my old DSC-S90 worked fine but not on this camera.The flash on this camera is impressive, lighting up and entire room at nighttime to produce a shot that looks like daytime. So I'll give it that. But forget the Nightshot - it's so grainy you won't be able to print it. Maybe it's good if you want to catch a drug dealer or a cheating spouse without a flash, but the quality is not nearly good enough to print.The accessories are nice (the battery charger is good, the remote is cool, the lens adapter a nice add on.) But if I can't get good pictures, what good are the accessories?As far as the Zoom is concerned....yes it does go pretty far. But again, results are mixed - sometimes you get a decent picture, sometimes not.I bought this camera because my son graduated from school and I wanted to have nice pictures - and because my DSC-S90 finally died (after years of dedication and hard work and great looking pictures!) At the graduation ceremony, I specifically wanted 3 pictures - one where my son shook the hand of the principal, one where he accepted his diploma, and one where he was walking off the stage. Since I was about 15 rows back, I had to use the Zoom on the camera. Well, I got the first shot....but it came out blurry. And then....what....\"Processing\"...oh no....trying to click over and over...nothing...whoops, there goes...I got half of his back as he was walking away. So anyone who says the lag time is impressive is way off base - it ruined my pictures of this event that cannot be repeated!It deeply saddens me to write this review....because I have always loved Sony products....but this time, I want to warn others before getting this model.Will I buy another Sony? Yes, because I believe everyone (including Sony) is entitled to make one mistake. But it won't be this model. I'll try to get something that works as well as my old DSC-S90 4 megapixel.

So, far it's done all of this flawlessly.One other thing that I really love is the \"in-camera\" photo editing, especially the red-eye removal. No more loading up a program, opening the picture, circling the eyes...etc. It's all done automatically.This has been a great camera for me!", "Date": "June 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great step up.", "Author": "J.

I previously used an Olympus Stylus 760 and that camera is nothing compared to this new Sony. Things that I have noticed so far in comparison to that camera are:-Much faster. Focusing, shutter lag, etc.-Sharper pictures. Everything is so clear. Makes the Olympus' lens seem soft.-Just an overall joy to use. This camera makes me want to keep shooting rather than just taking pictures when they may come up.Haven't done too much low light shooting yet so can't really judge on that but what I have done so far seems to be a clear step up from my Olympus. I haven't found any major cons to this camera yet as it is still new and exciting to me. I just have to keep remembering to take off the lens cap when I turn it on. So overall this camera is a great point and shoot with a great zoom with excellent image stabilization that also allows a good amount of manual control. It is no DSLR that is for sure but it is not intended to be so I cannot judge it on that. This camera definitely deserves a look by anyone who does not need a compact camera and appreciates a powerful optical zoom and manual control.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sony DSCH50", "Author": "Donald J.

Jackson", "ReviewID": "R2IYW7Z78H52C7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera after returning a Canon SX100 IS, a Nikon L100, and a 10mp Sony that was so horrible I forgot the model number.  I've read through many of the reviews on this site posted on this camera.  Some \"Cons\" I've read are: *Requires a Sony memory stick (I purchased 4gig memory stick at Radio Shack and the amount of photos it stores seems endless even at full resolution).  *The lens hood gets in the way (When I opened the box, the lens was packaged with the 2 piece hood turned backwards and locked within itself.  I'm also guilty of attaching it to the camera that way, and yes! it does get in the way.  But, if you assemble it properly, it doesn't get in the way.)  *The hood is visible in the photo (that's true, but very easily overcome by zooming till it's not visible.  Also, the small amount of \"hood\" visible can easily be cropped out of the photo.  Usually when I use the hood it's because I'm zooming, it's very sunny out, etc.  So personally, this hasn't be an issue at all).  *Must extend the lens to view, load photos, etc. (Actually you can press the 'play' button and view, load, delete photos without extending the lens.  After doing so, you can press the power button and it will shut down)Doesn't focus properly (With any lens / camera there are limitations!  I have a 50mm prime lens on my Nikon D300 and many times it won't focus clearly.  The issue is usually your too close for the lens / AF to properly focus.  With the H50 you need to be at wide angle and simply move closer to the subject.  If your close and zooming many times....  that basically creates a condition of being too close for the AF.  The macro on the camera requires you to be VERY close most times so it's just a matter or playing with the wide angle / zoom and moving closer.  The things I really like about the camera is the ability to use manual modes.  The shutter speed / aperture are \"virtual', so it's more of a novelty versus something you'll see very noticeable differences with.  However, the manual modes allows you to select from a few setting that adjust the color saturation, etc.  And that is one of my favorite features.  Also, few point and shoot cameras offer a remote control, and that's what really won me over on this camera, as did the tilt screen.  The tilt screen allows you to change your shooting perspective without laying on the floor / ground to see the screen.  I have a 3 year old son and usually hold my camera at waist level and flip the screen so I'm looking down at it.  The difference between taking pics that way versus aiming downward is AMAZING.  Also, the remote not only allows you to get in the photo, but....  if your taking photos of children, etc. your able to place the camera on a tripod and work on getting that smile out there... while not holding the camera!!!  As with every point and shoot camera I've ever used or owned, you have to take 3 or 4 photos to get the one you want and this camera is no exception.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "sONY dsc h50 REVIEW", "Author": "N. Marshall", "ReviewID": "RUWL17QSZ5Z73", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been diligently reading reviews on cameras in this class and ran out of time and had to make a decision, so picked this one over the Cannon S5.  Not sure if that was the correct decision after viewing the image quality.Overal I very much like the controls and features, especially the face ID which is of course not unique to this camera.  The 3 inch LCD screen is also excellent and the tilt feature is useful for odd angle shots.  I have small children and don't always want to kneel down for pics.  The tiltable screen allows me to stand and still take shots at the kids level.So, all was great until viewing the pics on my PC.  I am not a pro and probably couldn't tell noise from chromatic aberrations if they hit me in the face, so my opinion is purely amateur, so take this with a grain of salt.  Pics were viewed with Microsoft Media Player (or the photo equivalent that comes with Vista).  Most were 5 megpaixel and some at 9.I mostly used the face ID facility and took the pics once the face was detected and indicated \"green\".  Overall I am frustrated at the lack of sharpness, some of which might be explained by the size of the pic rendered on the PC screen which is at least 8x10 and usually larger.  Practically every pic I took, regardless of being taken outside with plenty of light or inside using flash were not as sharp as I would like.Color rendering is pleasant and generally natural but to me, if the pic isn't sharp, nothing else matters.I also own a Sony DSC H 1 which has roughly the same level of sharpness, but the sharpness is adjustable, but not on this camera (unless I haven't come across it in the MENU).  I overcame the lack of sharpnes to some degree on my H1 by shooting in Shutter priority and keeping the shutter speed up as much as possible.  May have to do the same with this camera which is disappointing.I realize the D SLR's have larger sensors and would have opted for one of those, except I didn't want to have a separate camera and camcorder.  Plus the multiple lenses is expensive and a bit of a pain.Any tips on sharpening the pics are welcome.", "Date": "June 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Todd C. Keyser", "ReviewID": "R1FEXMFG4MLWTH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a trip to Europe that me and my wife were planning on taking and the camera hit a homerun. The ISO setting does a great job inside cathedrals which tend to be fairly dark. I was able to take pretty good interior pictures without a flash. My wife stopped taking pictures with her camera after she saw mine. The only thing you have to watch out for is people walking through your shot when shooting on the ISO setting because any movement in the shot is blurred.The one feature that was a pleasant surprise is the rotating LCD screen. When everyone around me was bending over backwards to take shots of the cathedral domes and ceilings, I was able to rotate the screen out and shoot straight up. The rotating screen was also great when I was taking pictures in crowds because I could raise the camera over my head with the screen rotated down and get great shots.Once I got home and played around with the pictures I realized that I could zoom in on the pictures I took and still have a very sharp picture. I kind of regret zooming in too much now on some of my shots because I chopped off some things that I did not notice until I was reviewing the pictures on my computer. The zoom is awesome! It was neat to be able to take pictures from a distance and then zoom in on areas for detailed pictures. Just don't get over zealous and leave some extra room around your shot because you can always crop the picture later.Most of my pictures were extremely sharp, but a few were a bit fuzzy. I think the fuzziness was more user error than anything else. Based on the sharpness of the other pictures I am guessing that I either rushed the picture or had the camera on the wrong setting.The large LCD screen is great although it is hard to see in bright sunlight. I still loved the screen and the fact that it rotates up and down.Battery life is decent. I bought a second battery and just swapped them when one battery would get low. The 4 GB card is all you will need. I took close to 1000 pictures on the highest setting along with some video.The video taking ability of this camera is very good.  The video is sharp and clear and looks like it came from a camcorder.", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "sony cybershot h50", "Author": "victoria", "ReviewID": "R3DRRLL19SL6V4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this camera is awesome!! i am so thrilled with it so far and i still have lots to learn.The Auto button gave me great prof/quality like pictures...and the family responded the same way to the pics i sent.

I did a lot of research before buying, and I seriously could not have made a better choice! I've been using it for about a year now, and here are my observations...Pros:- The zoom! It gives me access to pictures I never could have taken with my old Canon Powershot.- The picture quality. I hardly ever need to use the other camera modes, because the Auto setting takes amazing pictures on its own. The color is vivid, the images are sharp...it often makes you look like a pro!- The flexibility. The flash and focus have several different (and easily accessed) settings that enable you to tailor them to your picture. This really came in handy when I had to take very close-up pictures of plants for a Vegetation class. The pictures I took were perfectly focused, something many of the students in my class had a hard time with.- The display. It's huge! Not only that, but you can pop it out and tilt it this way and that, allowing you to see what you're doing if taking a picture from an odd angle.- The ease of use. The controls are quite intuitive, and the menus are simple to use annd understand.Cons:-The battery. While it's great to be able to recharge the battery and not worry about buying new ones all the time, the downside is that you're limited to the charge you have in your camera - once it runs out you'd better hope you're near a plug, and even then, it'll be while before you can use it again. I'm studying abroad in Ireland this summer, and I plan to buy a spare (or maybe 2!) that I can charge up and carry around as backup. Because as nice as all the features are, they eat up battery life fast.- The bulk. No matter how much I love the zoom and display, they sure do make it big. Of course, this is to be expected with this kind of camera. Just keep in mind that this is a camera you will lug around, rather than just slipping it in your back pocket. It's totally worth it, though!If you're looking for something that takes incredible pictures, but is easy to use, this is your camera.

After reviewing a lot of different cameras, this Sony seemed to match what I needed.Sony Cyber-shot DSCH50 9.1 MP Digital Camera with 15x Optical Zoom with Super Steady ShotI'm not big on reading instructions, and I was able to quickly use the camera without them. A few functions needed a quick lookup, but most are intuitive. I took the camera on our trip to Disneyworld, and shot 3,800 photos on our 12 day visit.Everything about the camera worked well. With the basic setting on, I was able to take quick and easy shots of the kids and the family, and they all worked well.

My only quip about the continuous shutter is that the speed is not consistant, its starts quickly, then the clicks slow down while it processes, then it speeds up again. That's a minor issue, I still built some great sequences of my three year old twin boys.When I turned to manual mode, the settings were easy to use, and I was able to make some great images. I'll post some pictures of fireworks and animals that I took using manual mode, they came out great. The image stabilization worked great as well, the fireworks shots were taken with the camera on a beanbag on a metal railing. Even with a 3 second shutter speed, the child 10 feet away kicking the railing was clearly felt in my arms, but not in the image.The colors came out great, the images clear, even at full zoom.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this camera for thos that, like me, use a camera for quick shots usually but occasionally like more control.", "Date": "April 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Just what I was looking for", "Author": "maximum verbosity", "ReviewID": "R152RK8WT20GVO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I searched for several months when I decided to go a step-up from my Canon point-and-shoot.  I liked the idea of a digital SLR, except for the fact that I couldn't find one that also recorded sound and video.  This was very important to me because I liked the convenience of the point-and-shoot having a built in video recorder and didn't want to have to start carrying two separate cameras around.  But I also wanted the versatility of being able to change lenses, something I wasn't going to get with most of the cameras that had video capability.  The thing that finally sold me on this camera was that I was getting the best of both worlds; video recording and something like a digital slr....this camera is actually called a hybrid because it has a really simple point-n-shoot setting, but also has the capability of setting all of the photographer-techie stuff like aperature, etc. manually.The neatest thing is the smile detector.  When this is on, you can point the camera at a person and the minute they smile, it takes the picture.  You can set it to focus just on children's smiles (which is helpful in a group shot) or just adults or if it's only one person in the photo, just when they smile.The macro-lense setting is amazing, I love the detail and depth I've gotten when using this setting.  And the ability to virtually switch lenses is pretty neat too.  The lense itself is a Carl Zeiss so you know it's top of the line, probably better than you'd find with a digital slr, most of those cameras don't even include a lense in the price of the camera purchase, so that's a separate expense.The camera is lightweight, but feels solid in your hand.  I haven't read the handbook so all of the photos I've taken have been just from messing around with it and I've gotten some pretty good shots.  I'm sure once I read the manual, my pretty good shots will become amazing because this camera can do it.The battery life is good so far.  Not as good as a point and shoot, but I can use the camera everyday for several days, a few shots here and there, before I have to charge it in the included wall charger.The only negative thing I can find is that the memory card is too small to fit into the card reader on my laptop (A Toshiba Satellite) so I bought an adapter when I bought a new card.  However, I can't get them to work properly together, I get error messages and end up having to get the pictures off of the camera by hooking it up via USB.  Which isn't a big deal, I just like the convenience of popping the card out of the camera and into my laptop and not messing with finding the cord or having it with me when I want to get my pictures.

I used it at my sons football game last night and had a little trouble with blurry pics when they were moving, I even tried it in the sports shooting mode and the pics justcame out dark. When they did stand still, the pictures were great.  I do have some advice about getting that extra lithium battery for a back up.  First of all I recommend it for those times that you need to get those important shots and the battery goes dead. This camera only uses the \"infoLithium\" style batterys, DO NOT purchase a cheaper one from other battery stores, you will get a black screen that tells you that you need to use only \"infolithium batteries\" and will have to return it as I did.  I will tell you that Buy.com had the best price for this battery (sorry Amazon).  If a lot of functions and settings confuse you, then this may not be the camera for you, but if you have some knowledge of camera function than this is a great buy.  I will also mention that I had a little trouble finding a camera bag to fit this camera.  Sony has a case that says it will fit, but it looks like there would not be too much more room for extra items that I like to carry with my camera.  I did find a case at ebags.com from Crumpler called \"the 3 million dollar\"  the best way to describe it is a small version of a book bag.  it has great protection for the camera and is very comfortable to wear and has room for the extras I mentioned.

The image stabilization system works very well as does the night mode for taking shots in limited light without flash.  I have also been impressed with the performance of the Macro mode, especially as I like to photograph flowers.I have been delighted with picture quality which is superb for this price point.  The ability to use up to a 16mb card also gives more than enough capacity for my needs.The unit is well constructed, very intuitive to use (this could be because I have had several Sony cameras) and the ergonomics are excellent.  There are several modes from fully automatic point and shoot through to almost fully manual operation which gives the user a wide range of artistic options if required.On the negative side it is a little large (although not heavy) but still way more manageable than an SLR.  The LCD is poor in bright sunlight in common with most of the digital cameras I have used.  I also found some of the features such as smile capture a tad gimmicky for my taste.In conclusion I am very pleased with my latest Sony camera.

This is because petal-style hoods take into account the aspect ratio of the camera's film or digital sensor, and so the angle of view is greater in one direction than the other.If the lens hood is inadequate, there are some easy but less convenient workarounds.  Placing a hand or piece of paper exterior to the side of the lens which is nearest the flare-inducing light source can mimic the effect of a proper lens hood.  On the other hand, it is sometimes hard to gauge when this makeshift hood will accidentally become part of the picture.  A more expensive solution used by many pros is using adjustable bellows.  This is just a lens hood which adjusts to precisely match the field of view for a given focal length.Generally, It's great, but the general image quality is pretty good, not the top. the camera itself is really light, out of my expectation.", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Did not like this camera!", "Author": "T.

Some of the features that I have come to love about it are:most impressed with action photos- great pics, no blur, great detail (must be in well lit place)- if planning on taking a lot of action shots indoor (basketball, wrestling, etc.  I don't think I would recommend this camera unless the gym is well lit- for outdoor shots the pics are beautiful)when you are viewing pictures if you lightly touch the snap button it will instantly take you back to the picture taking mode- which helps catch those moments- I didn't realize how much I loved this feature until some family members asked me to use their cameras to take some pictures- I had to switch modes on their cameras and realized how much time you loose.really like being able to crop the pictures on the camera- gives you the option to zoom while cropping which is a feature I was always interested in finding in a camera or photo softwarethe video options are fun- can record in b/w, sepia, and a few other colorsthe zoom is great- I was at my daughters school play and I was in the back of the auditorium but the zoom made it seem like I was in the front rowthe slide show with music is funthe LCD screen pulls out and that's funVery, very happy with the camera- have received a lot of compliments on picturesalso, you can find extra batteries for cheap prices- I ordered one on line for $12 (including tax and s/h)The only reason that I gave the camera 4 stars is b/c the camera is now $599 and for that price I would expect a better picture for the action shots in low lighting- all other features have exceeded expectations.", "Date": "June 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "I Love My Sony H50", "Author": "Kady21", "ReviewID": "R2V356K41PSV7O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After returning a Canon Sure-Shot I received, and did not like at all, I did a lot of searching reviews before deciding on the H50. Even then I still wasnt sure it would be the camera for me. I have to say that so far I have been more than satisfied with the ease of use and quality of this camera. I have taken over 200 photos and other than due to my own errors each photo has come out wonderfuly. I havent gotten the hang of a few of the options and settings but even the basic ones take great pics. The color and clarity come out crisp and detailed. Photos of moving objects are well defined and stop action seems to work better than I had expected. The super steady shot is great, it really prevents blurring and the viewfinder or screen option is great. Battery life seems fairly good but I will get a second battery to have on hand. I have used this for about 3 weeks and so far I am glad I chose the H50.

It takes a little to get used to the several options, but it works nicely. This is what they call a \"prosumer\" product, for someone that wants some more than over the regular user.The only flaw I see here is the location of the zoom. If you hold the camera with one hand only, you will probably push the zoom without noticing. Is a matter to get used to it.I'm a fan from Sony products, none of them have ever dissapointed me. Now, if you are looking for something just to point and shot, maybe you shoudl try with the new slim ones with touchscreen, they are amazing.

I did not think I would use the flip LCD, but it comes in handy with shots of kids and other subjects that would ordinaraly require bending down or squating making my shutter hand a little shaky.All in all an improved product with obvious research and development from it's predecessors, lighter weight, and less expensive to boot.", "Date": "January 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera", "Author": "D.

Pham", "ReviewID": "R1WTJYNI9BPC96", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was shopping around and narrowed it down to the Sony DSC-H50 or the Canon PowerShot SX20IS. I decided to get the Sonby DSC-H50 because it was within my budget as I was a student getting ready to study abroad for the summer. I was glad that I got this for many reasons. Here are the reasons why I like the camera before I bought it and after I bought it:1. For the price, it was affordable.2. It had the blast shot/multi-shot which I needed since I was going to the outback and needed to take pictures of animals which would hop or fly off pretty fast at the sound of human beings. Just hold down the button to take pictures for 1-2 second and it'll take several frames. This is also good for taking baby pictures.3. The battery. The Canon PowerShot uses AA batteries and I didn't wanted to have to carry AA batteries with me even though I can buy the rechargeable ones. I'm more likely to lose rechargeable AA batteries than I am with a battery made for the camera. Also the charger! It's in one piece!! Unlike other camera chargers that would have a separate outlet for the charger. Just one plug into the wall, slide the battery in, and it's ready to charge!!4. It had the Carl-Zeiss lens.5. The zoom was excellent (15x zoom). Even though the Canon one had 20x zoom, Canon was just way out of my price range. Great zooms might be good but without the tripod, it might be a bit difficult to take steady photos.6. I can connect the camera to the TV. After I bought it, I found out that I can plug it into the TV and play it with the slide show with music! How cool is that?! Viewers won't be bored looking at the photos without music. You can add other music too but I haven't done that because the music provided are good slide show music.7. It takes great shot in low light setting. Believe it or not, I used the movie mode to record my brother's wedding and made a whole wedding DVD out of it! The quality of the video is really good. It still look really good watching the video on a 42 inch TV. And I'm pretty sure it will still look good on a bigger TV. The camera captures really good video. At the wedding, I could still see people in the background really well. You just have to be close to the subject in order to hear what they're saying unless they're speaking on the microphone. I had to stay within 20 ft of the speakers in order to get good sounds when people are speaking on the microphone. I just don't like how it only records up to 10 minutes of video at a time. But it's fine. It makes it easier for me to separate the video clips.8. It's got several USB connection mode. I don't really understand how it works but when the USB Mode was in Mass Storage Mode, I couldn't connect my camera in a computer at Australia so I had to use the USB Mode in PTP. I guess different computers recognizes different USB connectors. There is an Auto USB detector mode.9. There is the pop out tilt screen but I just wish I can turn the screen 360 or even 180 to take self portraits like how the Canon version can turn the whole screen.The cons:1. Sometimes it doesn't focuses on certain objects that I want to take.2. It uses the Sony Memory Stick which is the more expensive memory card compared the the SD card used in many other cameras.To be honest, I use only 3 mode of the camera which is the Auto, the Easy, and the Movie mode. It's really easy to use. This is my 3rd digital camera.

You thinking about getting an SLR? And do you want it in the 400 range? This is your best choice.. you would not regret it anytime.. Sony never put me down and this time it has kept my hopes high... I have been using this camera for the past 1 year... exactly 1 year before i bought this camera and you should understand this is worth getting.Cons:eAlthough the battery life is not that great... but that is negligible as a digital camera with such a zoom and pixel facility you should have a backup battery at any time. I have a backup battery and i never ran out of battery.The second con, not exactly, is the portability... it cant be kept in a pocket.. stop joking! why do you want to keep such a camera in a pocket? Its precious to be kept in its own bag.Pros:No words, trust me .. i have used it for 1 year... i have amazing pics and videos.. i have learnt photography i should say. It comes with a remote control which helps you in many ways. I haven't utilized it much but most of you would use it to the core.The tilt LCD display i should talk about - This is a very good feature a camera should have. I have taken awesome pics using it.I bought it from Amazon and they delivered in time as usual. They haven't delayed my package at any time. Make sure you order a carrying bag, extra battery and a memory card .. probably a 4 GB should be more than enough. Thats all it needs. You are all set now :).

The trouble with such cameras is to  manage in the ergometric design the data displayed on a small viewfinder. Most noticeable here is that one's (sometimes sweaty) nose shares intimate space with the movable LCD viewing screen should you wish to reduce battery load by using the excellent optical view finder - (Check out the battery price) There appears to be another problem with the use of lens filters (UV & polarizing).  Repeated enquiry of Sony's \"customer service\" returned garbage replies;  although these accessories are advertized no one seems to know how they are fitted and whether they influence auto-focussing.  This camera is possibly one of the few that do not download RAW data which a user of such a class of model would expect.

Unfortunately, I was wrong. My old point and shoot takes better pictures on a consistent basis than the Sony H50 does. I was really wanting a digital SLR but it wasn't in the budget at the time, so I settled for this one and I ended up being disappointed. I was frustrated by how misleading the LCD screen was. A picture would look perfect on the LCD screen, and I'd even zoom in a bit to make sure the image was sharp and in-focus. But without fail I would always get the images back on my computer and notice that they were fuzzy! It was especially frustrating when taking family portraits and having only a few salvageable pictures out of the many that were taken, even after checking the images more carefully on the screen. I did manage to get some breathtaking shots from this camera, but it was so inconsistent that I didn't feel like I ever knew how my pictures would turn out and found myself holding my breath when I uploaded them to my computer. Just not consistent enough for me.Another thing that bothered me was the noise of this camera. I couldn't delete, fix, browse or do anything with this camera without it beeping at me each time I pushed a button. I searched but couldn't find a way to turn off the beep, thinking maybe there was a mute button. It was hard to shoot and check my images while still trying to be discreet in certain settings (ie, places you don't want your camera beeping and interrupting proceedings or scaring off wildlife).I ended up selling this camera after 2 months of frustration and saved up for an SLR. I have had the Nikon D60 now for a few months and couldn't be happier with it. It is a great camera for people who are new to the SLR type camera (like myself) and has improved my photography immensely. I would not recommend this camera. Save up for the digital SLR instead.

Sony is incompatable with every other product.  Lenses, batteries, even USB cords.

Picture quality is horrible in less than perfect conditions.  Any pictures taken from less that high light outdoor conditions comes out grainy and of generally low quality.  Have tried all custom settings including ISO settings, shutter speed and aperature.  P,S,M and all other settings.  Also experiemented with all manual and semi-automatic focus settings.  None provide anything near the quality of my old Canon Powershot, and Nikon K1000 35mm.3. Viewfinder is pathetic.

I currently use a Sony W100 which is a great camera but only has a 3x optical zoom.I figured I'd go ahead and purchase the H50 since it replaced the H9. The image quality on this camera is really bad. The pictures are terribly grainy when viewing actual pixels on the PC. It is hard to tell how bad they are on the 3 inch viewfinder, but once you view them on your computer you'll see it. It's terrible. I couldn't believe how much better the pictures on my W100 were. The w100 is over a year old now and was about half as expensive.I brought my H50 back to best buy and got a replacement thinking the unit itself was damaged. The replacement was just as bad so best buy gave me a full refund.As of the time of this review there were no available updates to the camera software on the Sony's website.I downloaded some sample photos from the H9 and they were good - definitely better than the H50 pictures.

I spent god knows how much time in the store playing with it and taking multiple shots. I even brought my own pro duo memory card in case i needed to analize the quality of pictures later.  What i can tell is the camera is decently built and feels solid but not comfortable to hold, the grip was small and cornery. Also where the thumb is suppose to support the camera there is zoom control, so you unintentionally hit it every now and then. Browsing among multiple menu options almost drove me nuts. I usually figure out any device in minutes, i`m tech savvy, so to speak. But this one is unbelievably tricky. I lost track of time and space trying to figure out simple things like adjusting ISO, sharpness, contrast...etc.  And then taking pictures in the distance with a full zoom i was wondering about the perfomance of the anti-shake sistem. What can i say, I`m disappointed. Most of pictures came out blurry. I put in another SD card that i had in another camera and those pictures came out rather sharp and clear. I intentionally don`t tell another camera`s name. Having come home i tried to read the memory card with Sony pictures and my computer failed to read it...
