It was the only one I could find ata decent price that was also tall enough to be seen over my ellipticaltrainer. It is a very solidly made stand, but not very well designed.1st drawback: Nearly the entire thing is put together with tiny setscrews (a dozen in all) that you must tighten with a tiny allen wrench.This makes height adjustments quite a pain. Peerless really should haveat least put a thumb screw at the height adjustment pipe. To workaroundthis, I found an adjustable hose clamp with a built in plasticthumbscrew at the 99cent store, and it works great.2nd drawback: There is no up/down angle adjustment where the tv ismounted, so it must always stay basically flat perpendicular to thefloor. Adding this feature would probably have added somewhat to theprice, but I would have gladly paid for it.Other than these two issues, this is a solid and pretty nice-lookingstand which can also hide your cables pretty well.", "Date": "November 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Perfect for the home workout room", "Author": "E. Helmuth", "ReviewID": "R8G99662HPIO9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this stand for mounting a 26\" LCD television high enough to see it on the exercise bike in the basement workout room. It works great, and would be fine for a treadmill or other equipment. It is very well made and very easy to assemble with clear instructions. The price seemed high to me until I received it - the materials and machining are top quality. Before you buy it, though, be sure that your TV has a VESA 75 or 100 mounting pattern (hole spacing for the mounting plate screws). The LG televisions on Amazon list the VESA mounting patterns in the PDF spec sheet; for other manufacturers you may have download a product manual on the manufacturer's website and go to the wall mounting section for this info. Most but not all  TV's under 30\" use VESA 75 or 100.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Stand for the Smaller monitor/tv", "Author": "Ace", "ReviewID": "R3HFCO72YZU81S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This stand works great depending on what you are trying to use it for.I actually called up Peerless and got an adapter so that the VESA could expand to 200x200 (this allows for larger tv's to be mounted).When screwed into the floor OR with heavy weights on the legs/stand holding it down, I have actually mount a 47\" on it with the VESA Adapter Plate sold seperatley. The TV was less than the 40lb weight limit.I also went to home depot and purchased different screws for the assembly of it to add extra security.I have dealt with lots of Floor stands before and this one does the job people.  Just make sure you are using it properly and are buying it for the right purpose.  It will easily mount a TV/Monitor up to roughly 28\" (as long as the VESA is 100x100), without any extra purchases or equipment.  If you want to knock it down, you can.....its not the heaviest thing in the world.  It literally weighs 25lbs.I like it.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "A good stand with an achilles heal", "Author": "joelifer \"joelifer\"", "ReviewID": "R19Y005DQHH9HJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The stand appeared to be exactly what I wanted. The numerous socket set screws were really no big deal.There is minimal wobble, but nothing of concern. HOWEVER, if you do not plan to bolt this to the floor or to something likea 3/4th \" plywood board, be prepaired for some significant bending of the frame at the base and ultimately ALOT of wobbling.I had to jerry-rig a 1/2\" square aluminum pipe under the base and place 4 felt base threaded stem glides threw the squarepipe and the frame of this stand to give it enough structure integrity so that it could remain free standing and stable.Given the price, I still think it was a worthwhile product- but needs some minimal design help.", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Decent option, but not great engineering", "Author": "R.

We mounted a 32\" tv that was well within the weight limits. It performed very nicely. But the tubing is really a lot thicker than it looks in the pictures. It's very sturdy construction, so you know it will hold. But the hex screws seem kind of chintzy -- couldn't they use thumb screws or something more accessible? The bottom cross tube is very thick and the picture hides the length of the feet extending out the back of the tube (4\" or more).Maybe my use wasn't ever intended, but I think with a little industrial design, this would be an awesome alternative to a wall mount.

Neighbors", "ReviewID": "RZNBQQJ0KDENS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This product is structurally well designed, however, the internal diameter of the upper pole that attaches to the monitor is 1.25 inches, which is less than the width of any VGA cable we have been able to find to this point.  So, there is no way to utilize the cable management hole that is provided when using a VGA cable; since this is a monitor stand, it would seem important.  Its as if the manufacturer never actually fully tested their design.  I contacted the manufacturer and asked them to recommend a VGA cable for use. The responded with the following:\"Thank you for contacting Peerless Industries.  I contacted our engineering team and after testing with the cables, it has been found that the VGA cable will not work with this.  The tubing is not large enough to accommodate the plug.\"So I would only recommend this product if you plan on having your vga cable exposed.", "Date": "January 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good stand for Treadmills", "Author": "THD", "ReviewID": "R3FJ0II21FJTTW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The display stand is being used with a True treadmill with the addition of a custom made mouse/keyboard tray so my wife can walk while working on her computer. The stand is good and well made. The only drawbacks are that the holes for the cable are not big enough for VGA (they're fine for HDMI), the ability to adjust it is limited, and the way my monitor attaches required me to slightly cut the VGA cable connector.I also noted that when walking on the treadmill, the monitor oscillates slightly, but this is probably due to the base being on a carpet and under the front of the treadmill. I'm trying to figure out a way to stop this. My wife hasn't complained about it - just an observation I made.If you're thinking of adding a monitor or TV to a treadmill or elliptical, it's probably a very good choice.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simple solution, Great price.", "Author": "Daniel Wiersma", "ReviewID": "R1D8QX12HTBFL4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "An inexpensive alternative to drilling holes in my 'stand-up' desk ..... this get's the job done nicely - - - for only $125.00!", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for treadmill, paired with LED TV & Roku stick", "Author": "JBinDC", "ReviewID": "R6J7MR7S5OHFR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "See picture.  I used this stand to mount a Samsung UN19F4000 19-Inch LED TV in front of my treadmill and plugged in a Roku stick for wireless streaming.  I adjusted the height of the stand so that the TV is in the middle of my line of sight when I'm on the treadmill (I'm 5'10\").  The prongs in the front of the stand fit under the front of my treadmill, so I could bring it in close.  There are holes at the top and bottom to hide cables but if your TV power cord has an adapter box (like mine does) you may not be able to hide it.The stand is well made, very sturdy, I'm sure it could support a much larger TV.  The only criticism I have is that the threading in the drilled holes isn't always precise and it took a while to line up the little screws that hold it together, but overall the assembly is not complicated and once the screws are in the whole stand can be adjusted with the included allen wrench.
