I tried several batteries, none worked.  I was looking for a fun novelty camera, but as a novelty camera it is useless.  It's not a camera in my opinion it's a novelty key chain.  Doesn't live up to it's advertising.  I never was able to take a single picture with it.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Overpriced", "Author": "M. Lynette De Nike", "ReviewID": "R2VVBKUYGQZ0QE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This same identical camera is available from WalMart.com for $7.48 delivered to your local store and easy to return (to a store) if you have the negative experience of other reviewers. The brand is Cobra. I just bought one to have in my handbag at all times because I don't like the camera function on my phone. It's very cute to look at although it's ultra lightweight(inexpensive feeling)plastic. And it's simple to use. Perfect for my purposes. But if you want \"real\" photos of memories, you need to spend more money for a reliable camera. Or use disposable cameras. This should be considered a cute novelty item rather than a camera for any serious purpose.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works well but cant remember crap.", "Author": "Alecio", "ReviewID": "R1WIP0KF5GUNS0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So I bought this camera to bring on vacation. It took the pictures nicely but when I got home it lost it's memory.
