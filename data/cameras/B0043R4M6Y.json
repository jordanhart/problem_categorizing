The wifi connectivity works great on this camera, it might be kind of slow, but hey, is not a computer, nor an iPhone, no big deal for me.  I've been able to upload pictures to my Facebook from my house, my office, hotels/restaurants/malls wifi hotspots.The picture quality works very nice but this camera is not good for night shots/low light conditions, nor if you're moving while taking pictures.  ON/OFF actions are ok (not too fast, not too slow), zoom is OK (if you're a high level zoom lover, this is not for you).  The autofocus is a little bit slow, but the macro setting takes great pictures if your hands are steady.It is small and lightweight, fits in my pant's pockets just great.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cool and compact camera", "Author": "Kiara H.", "ReviewID": "R2RLEY0M9FG4XC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just recieved the camera a few days ago and sooo far its pretty awesome! i havent really sat down to figure out the more advanced features but the current setting take wonderful crisp photos. the touchscreen works like a dreamn with or with out the stylus. using the wifi feature takes some time but it beats having to pull out wires or my sd card to upload pics! this camera uses a micro sd card and it about the size of a credit card.
