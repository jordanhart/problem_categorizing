{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Small Stylish Digital", "Author": "John Woods \"TObject\"", "ReviewID": "RWRQFXVMLBQTP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nikon COOLPIX S50 is a compact, very stylish looking digital camera. This particular model has cherry-pearl red finish on the front, the top, and the bottom, accented by shiny chrome sides. The backside is black, dominated by a large LCD screen.The lens on the S50 is of non-protruding kind, automatically covered when the camera is off.This camera features a number of automatic scene modes, plus two automatic modes accessible with two tiny buttons on the top of the camera (anti-shake and portrait), plus a special High ISO mode. The range of manual controls is very limited. RAW file output is not possible.The menu system on this camera is multi-level; the menus change depending on which mode the camera is on. This in turn requires jumping through several windows to change controls; this can sometimes be confusing. For example: The ISO control is in the Shooting menu, where the VR on/off control is in the Setup menu. Furthermore, if the flash is turned on, it will not fire in the BSS (best shot selector) mode, which is understandable. However, turn the self-timer on, and the flash will fire; to turn the flash off, you would need to first turn the BSS off, and only then you could reach the flash modes menu.Look for on-line reviews with sample pictures to decide if the picture quality this camera produces will satisfy you. In my opinion, the pictures from S50 are noisy, soft, and over-sharpened. However I am willing to put up with so-so performance to have a camera that is as small as this one. If you are prepared to carry a bigger camera, you can definitely find one that takes better pictures.", "Date": "July 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Ahead of it's time", "Author": "Lori A. Baggio", "ReviewID": "R3NA0X5CPV42LN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is phenominal.  It is easy to use, the viewing screen is huge. The color is far beyond superb.  Be very very careful though when you purchase it through Amazon with the listing seller. Although the pricing seems to be good, it is an illusion because they rip the storage(memory card) out of it. You will be required to purchase one at a mere $70.00.  If you do not, you must set the camera image to a less than desirable preferance in order to take more than 4 pictures.In addition you will need to purchase additional battery's as well. They do not last long.  So if you are on the road with only 1 battery with no other's charge.  You will be stuck without a camera !", "Date": "November 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Overall nice camera for the price", "Author": "VSH \"Viv\"", "ReviewID": "R9RBQH0DL08O3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In a nutshell, I have owned this camera for about 8 monthsPros:Very pretty red colorHuge DisplayEasy to use - Very comparable to other digital cameras I have usedDecent price - Again compared to other cameras with around 7.2 MPMany nice features - video, etcLightweightCons:View finder is located in a poor area - people tend to put their fingers over it when they take a pictureThe zoom  - is not as impressive as I had hopedNot particularly durable - I have dropped this camera only once and the silver side paneling had cracked and chipped.", "Date": "May 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Coool", "Author": "G.
