Taylor \"runman\"", "ReviewID": "R293BE1NBHA3LD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a canon digital SLR camera, and wanted to go on a hummer 4x4 extreme off road adventure.  Rain was in the forecast and several days of rain on the trail already, taking the digital SLR was totally out of the question.I picked this nifty device based on the price, the batteries, storage on the SD card, and the 10mp really perked my interest.  The gentleman at the camera shop showed me the easy access on/off button, and where the \"press here for picture\" button is located.  20 minutes after the purchase, I was in the hummer taking photos and within the hour, I was being bounced around, getting muddy water all over me, I was able to laugh and press the button to take pictures without problem.Ease of operation:I use my cameras in the auto mode, (the if SLR is for my wife), and the auto mode does work.  I was able to view the pictures I took using the 2.5\" view screen with ease.  I did not even need the instruction manual.The batteries and memory card were easy to install too, without the need for instructions.  The camera does boast a host of different shooting modes, but auto is all I use.Picture quality:Not a fine as my digital SLR camera, but the price difference is over 1000.00 dollars.Compared to my old 5mp camera, this camera does a very good job for the price.  Image stabilization is WONDERFUL.  I was trying to take picture of the hummer tires while we were in motion bouncing everywhere (the tire at times was in the air) and the pictures look almost as if the tire is still.  You can read the manufacturer on the tireBattery life:After two days of use, the camera was still able to go.  To save battery life, the LCD screen turn itself off and the followed by the camera (the auto shut off was annoying some times)Summary:The camera is very easy to operate, image stabilization works very well.  Time from button press to picture taken is almost unnoticeable.Picture quality is pretty darn good.For the entry market, or for those looking for a good camera that won't break the bank, this maybe the camera you are looking for/", "Date": "May 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Paul Ferrara", "ReviewID": "R3UUVKPZFITQJ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received my camera today and I was impressed.  It's so tiny and has so much in the way of capabilities.  All I wanted it for was to take pictures of restaurants when I eat out (for Yelp).  Without adjusting the white balance or anything, every picture has been pefect.  I have three other Canon cameras: a G2 which cost me about $800 when new, a D60, and a 20D.  All of them are too large to lug around with me, while the A480 goes in my shirt pocket.  I uploaded some pictures, take a look.", "Date": "April 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Astounding macro shots", "Author": "Lonny D. Stark", "ReviewID": "R2ELTR1VUKFGJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a nice camera overall, but the macro shooting on the little A480 is positively splendid! The super-macro feature is unbelievably good. We've come a long way from the Kodak Instamatic cameras of 30 years ago, where your only chance of getting a tight closeup was to hold a very strong magnifying glass in front of the lens and hope that one of the photos turned out.I regularly use the A480 as a back-up to much more expensive gear - and every now and then it actually outperforms a DSLR camera and lens kit that cost me ten times its price. Anyone who enjoys taking experimental photos or shooting in the great outdoors -- nature geeks like me -- will appreciate this camera's macro abilities. It easily finds the correct focus and light levels, even on very difficult shots. The trick with a beautiful close-up photo is to have an attractively blurred background. Very smooth, \"creamy\" blur (referred to as bokeh) allows the subject to really pop from the photo. The bokeh of the A480 exceeds the quality of some of the more modestly priced, though reasonably good, DSLR lenses that fall in the $200-$400 range.Like most other point and shoot cameras, the A480 really shines in good strong lighting, and falls off a bit when used in dark settings with a flash. But even in poor lighting it is a remarkable little piece of equipment. Compared to most other point and shoot cameras, the A480 creates exceptionally rich photos with attractive color, sharpness, and tone. I use it regularly for website development projects, either to build photo galleries showing businesses and products, or to create textures and special FX graphics. The added Canon software is great as well and helps to supplement this camera. The Photostitch program, which creates a large panoramic image from a series of shots taken in sequence from left to right, was nearly perfect, and a riot to watch in action. It works best with photos taken from a tripod.The trick with any point and shoot is to take tons and tons of pictures, and then aggressively throw most of them out, retaining only the best. Unlike the old film days, it pays to burn through as many photos as your heart desires. Print only the best. This camera will help you create some real masterpieces.", "Date": "July 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Far exceeded my expectations", "Author": "Bww", "ReviewID": "R3TSDRWZZQ5265", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a small digital that would fit in my shirt pocket that used AA batteries and of course took good pictures.The Canon A480 far exceed my expectation.

I ran it through its paces first, and came away with a very favorable impression for a 10MP camera that sells for barely over $100. It is very easy to use and the picture quality is excellent. I like that it uses AA batteries which are easy to find anywhere. In addition to its standard \"automatic\" mode it has several options for \"custom\" modes. It has the normal \"macro\" setting for close-ups, but it has even another mode for very extreme close-ups which I find handy. It also records good video with sound, and you can play it back in various slow motion speeds if you want, in the camera or on a big screen TV. All in all I give it very high marks and especially for its price range. Its only disadvantage I could find is it is just a bit thicker than other small pocket cameras.", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great starter, low-cost camera", "Author": "Mr. Scott D. Desalvo \"Scott D.\"", "ReviewID": "R279FG4XCR6XL0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very nice, inexpensive camera.  Takes regular AA batteries, so it is easy to always be ready to take some pics.  I paired it with a cheap, hi-capacity memory card, and I can take photos for days.The included settings are very nice and this camera takes very good photos right out of the box, no monkeying around.  If you are a camera novice like me, and do not want to spend $200 or more on a camera, this camera is going to do everything you need it to do.I am not a pro, nor an amateur, nor even much of a hobbyist.  I do not read the manual that comes with cameras.  I needed a small, light, not too expensive camera to be able to take nice, high res photos with good, accurate color and detail and that is exactly what I got, at a price that is shockingly good.This is a very light, small camera, but it is maybe an inch to an inch and a half thick, so this is not the camera you want if you are looking for a tiny subcompact camera that fits in a shirt or jeans pocket with no bulge. But, it is small, but takes great pics, and there are a bunch of built-in scene modes, like Portrait, or Landscape--stuff like that so you can set the camera for what you are doing and take a nice picture.  It has a 3.3x zoom, which is handy.  You aren't going to be able to see the lion's eyeball if you take the camera on safari, but it allows you to zoom in on your friend's face, or a houseplant, or your dog, whatever, without dancing back and forth, to and fro to get a good framed shot.It is ready to take pictures in less than a second from the time you hit the power button, and it has surprisingly good battery life (I have a 5 MP Canon Powershot from 5 years ago higher up the line with doodads and features I only rarely used, but the battery life on that thing stinks).  The battery life on this camera is pretty darned good.Great starter camera for a kid or young adult, great camera for someone like me--who like to take some pics but will probably never worry about aperture or exposure or white level.  All around, general purpose camera that rocks sums it up well.", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Budget Camera", "Author": "Doggymcnuggets \"doggymcnuggets\"", "ReviewID": "R2UBZ3WVBL70ZC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second Canon digital point and shoot camera and it is a winner.  My wife and I seem to have lost our A620 (how do you lose a digital camera?!) and needed to replace it quickly with something inexpensive.  After doing some research we went with the A480 and are very satisfied.  The camera is svelte enough to travel in a pocket and is reasonably attractive in design.  Our bottom line most important criterion was picture quality, and the A480 delivers.  The pictures are close in quality to those of the A620, an older but significantly more expensive Canon \"A\" series model that offered more manual controls.  I was really surprised to get such good shots from such a budget price.  I've owned Fuji & Casio digital cameras and I find that comparably price Canon cameras take better pictures for the most part and the A480 only confirms this expectation.  The A480 is a model of simplicity, both in terms of controls and features.  There are a dozne \"scene modes\" but 90% of the time we simply use the auto mode and let the camera do the rest.  The pictures look great, both outdoor and indoor.  I was figuring that with a $90 camera we'd have to sacrifice picture quality but that isn't the case.  Speed-wise the camera is only average, showing a little bit of irritating lag time between pressing the button and capturing the shot.  You'll also have to wait a few seconds after shooting for the camera to ready itself for the next shot.  The A480 does, however, start up very quickly when you turn it on.  The less-than blazing speeds are not surprising given the price, and that's really the overall deal with the A480 - it all comes down to expectations.  This is a budget camera and for the sub-$100 price you get a quality instrument capable of delivering really good pictures, but without much in the way of features and a performance level that is not top tier.  A solid no-frills digital camera that offers good bang for buck and very good photo quality in a simple point and shoot package.", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Handy pocket camera", "Author": "NK \"Jordane's mom\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZZG8CQ616MWS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just a quick note about this handy little camera.

My husband has never been a huge camera user but used it on our daughter's field trip and found it to be user friendly.  We have been pleased with the video and picture quality for a $79 camera.

We started with Sonys and then I started buying Canon PowerShot a510, for reasons mentioned below. We rarely had \"lens error\" issues, I remember about 4 out of hundreds. When we got to the a480 being sold at the time of this writing, after almost no problems up to the a560, we got stuck lens with 6 out of every 10 cameras provided to our users.We liked Canon because unlike the Sonys, they used standard batteries, required no special and expensive cable to transfer, and the only dislike was that there was no native memory on the camera, requiring a memory stick from the get-go. All through the \"A\" series (530-580) we got good life from these cameras. But the newest model was virtually broken in the box.I assumed that this weakness of a spring or gearing was endemic to all cameras in this price range (under $150) since they all appear to spew from the same Chinese factory.

No image stabilization (though description says \"and an advanced Optical Image Stabilizer ...\")", "Author": "Stephen Dupre", "ReviewID": "RTNYCBDRIMGPK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I realize that other sites mention this model does NOT in fact have image stabilization. (and A470, A490, A490 don't either, by the way).But the Amazon.com text description of the A480 - as of 3/27/2010 says:\"...and an advanced Optical Image Stabilizer ...\" so it's possible some bought this camera based on that piece of text.  For those posting negative comments about others who've complained about \"blurry\" pictures, check the description again, it might have been false expectations and not their fault.You could argue that someone at Canon took the A590IS or some other Canon camera description *with*  image stabilization and cut-and-pasted it for the A480 and made an honest mistake.  It happens all the time.  It happened on the Sharp TV I bought off Amazon (4ms vs 6ms response time).I knew up-front this camera didn't have image stabilization and bought it anyway on price.  The LCD does show the \"red camera shake\" in low-light and the user should know this means the picture is more likely to be blurry in these cases.  Buyer beware.Now, to the review.  I have several Canon's - A520, A590IS, A470 - as well as a Pentax k-x SLR and a Fuji E900 - so it's on this experience that I base my review.Pros:- It's cheap and like most Canon's - it's great on batteries.- AA batteries always a plus for on-the-go- Decent video in medium to good light conditions- Pictures good in good light.  (10MP setting used)Cons:- Cheaply made. Too light. Seems like it would be easy to break if dropped.- low-light pictures aren't great.  Move out of the A470,480,490 models into something else if your indoor picture taking is low to very low light.- Weak documentation in this beginners camera (just a slim user guide) Had trouble putting it in \"MACRO\" mode, for instance.  Nothing on the CD that's useful (a PDF of the same printed users guide)I think Canon makes some good entry-level cameras for around $100-125.  But, to get the best value, if you can, buy at the time of the year when they're heavily discounted. (I think November and sometimes February).Then you may get a GREAT camera (like the A590IS) for only $40 more than what I paid for the A480 at a bad buying time (because of a birthday).  I think the $150 range (bought at the right time) gets you a lot more camera for the money.By the way, I bought the Canon PowerShot A590IS 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom - a far superior camera - for $110 on December 8th, 2009... about what the A480 retails for now... and you can't even compare the build quality.The A590IS has the bulk of the old A520 (4MP) - back when Canon made cameras you could throw against the wall...", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Cute, simple, and compact", "Author": "Diamond M. Dominguez \"diamon2x\"", "ReviewID": "R1QVZ9MWBLQQ05", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've just had this nice Canon A480 camera 3 days.  I bought it in exchange, returning a more expensive $200.00 canon model.  With the $200.00 Canon model, too many adjustments were necessary before snapping the simplest picture which made mad. But this A480 has very few function buttons which makes it easy to operate.  Of course it has setting functions for the more fussy photographer.  But if you just want a picture to capture a moment, you can practically point & shoot.  Good pictures outdoors and it takes REALLY GOOD FLASH SHOTS INDOORS AT NIGHTIME, which is most important to me for taking pictures in nightclubs.I HAVE ONE WARNING ABOUT THIS CAMERA WHEN IT COMES TO INDOOR PHOTOS. To avoid blurry indoor photos in places where the lighting is subdued, push the shutter halfway down first to allow the camera to \"auto focus\" first. You will see the little square narrow down on the LCD screen and then the camera will beep.  Once it beeps then you can now press the shutter all the way down to snap the picture. THE INSTRUCTIONS TELL YOU TO DO THIS, AND BELIEVE ME, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR INDOOR PHOTOS.  If you dont do this, some of your indoor photos may come out a tad blurry. Most of the time the auto focus function works very well outdoors on it's own by just snapping the picture. But indoors , pushing the shutter halfway to auto-focus first is a must to avoid blurry photos.INSTRUCTION BOOKLET: The paper instruction booklet that is enclosed with the camera gives only short summarized instructions. If you want to read the helpful detailed intructions that will really help you to understand this camera, you will have to insert the CD into your computer and download the 114 paged booklet.June 22, 2010: Update: I've had this camera for 6 months now.  It's still a very nice camera.  Outdoors, it is the greatest. Just point & shoot, and the photo is perfect.  However, for indoor photos, it is still important that you press the shutter halfway first so the camera can auto-adjust it's settings.  Otherwise your indoor photos may come out a tad blurry.

I called Canon and they said they had had this problem before and to send it in.

I've now owned 4 Canon cameras, which I like (obviously, I keep buying more), and this is the first one that I have had that used regular batteries as opposed to the Canon battery packs.  I wanted one that used regular batteries because if you have ever misplaced your Canon battery recharger, those usually run about $50.  I thought it would be more convenient but clearly, in this case, the \"regular\" battery option was not to be and I am back to spending $40 on Canon rechargeable batteries and a battery charger pack.  SO, if you think you are buying this for convenience of buying your batteries at the grocery or convenience store, think again.  You may be better off just buying a camera that comes with the battery pack and recharger OR add $40 to the price of this and buy the rechargeable battery kit (Canon kit CBK4-300).

I think this is a fantastic camera and my daughter loves using it.  We have had the camera for a couple of weeks.  I read all the other reviews on amazon before making the purchase (thanks!).While we love the camera, I am still not sure this camera will ultimately be sturdy enough for use by a 3 year old.  Our daughter is very careful with stuff and always uses the camera with the wrist strap, but with the lens extended, I fear it is only a matter of time until she bumps it into something or drops it on the floor.  So I am not sure I can recommend it as a sturdy first camera - time will tell.  But the design is very simple, it is a good size for her tiny hands (she is small for 3), and she is learning how to use functions like zoom and flash pretty quickly.  And she loves taking pictures!I also want to point out that the camera does a surprising good job with macro shots.  I am a casual photographer but I love taking close ups of flowers, textures, etc. and I recently purchased a Canon SX 200 IS (also from amazon).  The SX 200 is a fine camera and it does do great macros but, for my simple needs, if I had it to do all over again, I would be tempted to save some bucks and buy one of these instead.  Nice design.Update (4/9/2010): The camera is still going strong - my daughter has yet to destroy it by dropping it.  And she is taking a bunch of pictures and clearly having a blast.  I do recommend getting some rechargeable batteries for it as the batteries have gone flat at inopportune moments.  But if you carry fully charged spares you should be fine.Update (May 2011): The camera finally failed, but amazingly not because of any mistreatment by my 4 year old daughter. She was using it to take pictures one day and turned on the camera only to have it fail to snap pictures. It  then displayed the notorious \"Lens error\" message that so many other people mentioned in their reviews and the lens never retracted again.

I didn't find this at all when I tested this camera.  So, I bought it on the basis of how easy it is to use, and not that complicated.  When I got it home, I opened it up, put batteries in it, and put in the memory card.  I did a couple test shots, and low and behold I found what the reviewer was talking about.  When you take a picture, the immediate preview is grainy, but upon reviewing the archives, the picture turns out nothing like the \"preview\".  Full color, and clarity was awesome!

I've previously used Canon cameras and thought they were one of the best point-and-shoot brands. However, I was disapointed with the A480 the moment I unboxed it, and my disapointment only got worse with time.  I'm very likely to buy another brand as a replacement as a result of my experience with the A480. The only good aspect of the camera was it's image processor, which was as good as they get. When all went well, it took great pictures. It's really a shame Canon put this into such a cheaply built camera body. You feel the cheapness of it as soon as you pick it up. This turned out to be more than just an impression, as my lens mechanism began making a horrible grinding noise in a matter of weeks. I was actually relived that it did, as it gave me a real reason to ditch the camera. Other than it's sad lack of quality, it had the following problems:A) No image stabilization meant that unless you were in very very bright light, or using a flash, you would need to stabilize the camera against something or use a tripod or monopod to get a clear image.B) It eats batteries like candy, I only got useful battery life from the most expensive lithium photo batteries.C) No click-wheel for settings means you'll spend time running through unintuitive on sreen menus to find a setting instead of taking pictures. Likewise, you'll likely have to do the same inconvienient multi-menu process to turn off a mode, or worse forget to do so, and take an afternoon of outdoor pictures while still in \"aquarium\" mode.D) The flash takes far too long to recharge & during this time the camera is useless, 5-10 seconds between shots is seems to be the standard recharge time for this model.", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money on this...let me tell you why...", "Author": "J.

It has some limitations but it was, under the circumstances, a reasonable last minute substitute for the stolen camera and it used the SD flash memory used in the TZ4--and it was much cheaper than the Japanese version of the TZ4 (labelled the TZ7 which doesn't seem to be marketed in the US).  The lack of image stabilization meant that a few pictures went awry--a few more than I would have expected with the TZ4.  I missed the 28mm wide angle of the TZ4 occasionally and, on a few occasions,the 280 mm telephoto.  But it is 10mp and I can blow up some shots where the 280 telephoto would have been useful.  In all I took over 1700 pictures and most turned out OK.  The batteries (I'm not entirely sure they were alkaline--they had Japanese labels) lasted about 200 shots plus or minus, but I turned it on and off with great frequency--perhaps 850 times for 1700 shots (which, possibly, drains the battery a great deal?).  As a main camera I'd still go with the Panasonic TZ series but the TZ4 costs more than twice what this costs on Amazon.com.
