Execlent photos in the day, and execlent photos with the flash.  Zoom is incredible.  Indoor photos are good to very good, The low light photos have some strange and interesting artifacts when taking photos in automatic mode, however you can fix much of that with the manual settings if you know what you are doing. However that being said even the low light photos are better then most inexpensive cameras i have used.Battery life is good, not great but good.  I like that it takes standard AA batteries, so you never have to deal with dead propitary rechargables, In a pinch you can just buy some bat's and you are good to go. Works great with litium AA rechargables too, get them at any target or here on amazon. So you can get teh best of both worlds.The panorama feature is very slick, takes stunning shots.The only real minus I see is that the auto-focus will sometimes, well, just not focus very well. That may be adjustable with settings, this thing has a billion settings and I have only had it about a month and am still figuring it all out.I would recomend this camera hightly or it's youger brother the 12mp version. Same camera just slightly lower resolution. I have the 12mp at work and its a great camera too and significantly cheaper !  So if this is just a little pricy for you, get the 12mp one, its an awsome camera too.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Camera exceeded expectations", "Author": "Gregory M.

It arrived basically the next day.I bought this for the Zoom and view finder, the view finder is essential in sunny days. This replaced a Nikon L110 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 15x OpticalMy Previous Cameras were a Konica Minolta 4 MB (Still takes great pics after all the abuse, I use it as a backup, my 5 year old uses it) and the Nikon L110 (Nikon zoom broke on me within a year and needed to be replaced)The photos that this takes exceeded my Nikon L110 by alot. the zoom is great and the stabilization is fantastic. I am able to take the zoom shots and still crop a portion of the pic without losing any detailsI have not fully used all the features, the Panaramic is really nice and the pics are high MP... the pictures tend to be about 3 MBI have taken this to the Philly Zoo to fully test the shooting, Under all instances, bright, indoor, shady  - camera preformed better than my previous cameraI also take soccer pics and it has preformed great... I have challenenged myself to take one great pic a day... So far I have taken a picture of the Lightning (with the multishot feature) the moon just before dark, clouds, rainbows... and namy others... I am excited about taking photos with this camera because it gets the detailsI have recommended this to several people who have also bought it. You can't beat the features for the price....

My S1000 only needed to be replaced due to a chipped lense.  I spent a month looking at different cameras, DSLRs, and decided to wait out this new camera due to the success that i've had with the others.  I'm a point and shoot amateur photographer, and this camera line has made me look like quite the pro.  My camera goes everywhere with me, hiking, and packpacking, road trips... everywhere.  Producing fantastic photos most of the time.These are the issues i had with the S2800HD;1)  battery life is pathetic.  With the S1000, i can get a couple if not few, hundred photos out of four basic dur/ever. batteries. After 90 photos in one short outting, the batteries died on me.  (backpacking, every ounce counts, so i can't be packing in three times the amount of batteries.)2) the 'scene recognition' was often 'off'.  Taking photos of mountains, the camera would go into 'macro' mode.3) Holding the camera horizontally and vertically, while focused on the exact same point, would produce DRASTICALLY different images.  Horizontal would leave the photo washed out. Vert, provided rich wonderful color of the same object.4) On three different occasions, photos came out with very pink hues where such color was not present.  Specifically, in the clouds/sky over a waterfall on a rainy day, and worse, the 'stuff' in a stack of Oreos and the glass of milk as well.  QUite sure milk is white, not pink.5) I rec'd the camera two days before a very exciting, and incredibly scenic hike... The camera came with a basic instruction manual, and all of the added features had to be viewed on a disk.  I prefer to have a manual in the field.  Am i expected to carry my laptop with me to reference the best options for the shot, while hanging over a cliff?  Fuji let me down this time.After the excitement of purchasing this camera, I think i'm just going to go back to another S1000.  My entire family, and many of my friends have the S line of cameras all because they loved my very first.  I'm so disappointed that this new model didn't, from the very beginning, live up to basic point and shoot standards.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Tabby771", "ReviewID": "R28RQTJOOTVUOP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera and unless you're a professional you dont need anything better.

The Finepix 2800 HD is such a thing.I purchased this camera to replace an aging HP and being my 4th digital camera I felt I could easily find my way around and get down to the business of taking some decent pictures and videos. It pretty much does what it claims to do and I was initially happy with my purchase with a few reservations.As for as function goes, this is a pretty nice camera. A bit glitchy but the feature set is plentiful and I wanted something that had an actual viewfinder. While the image you see in the viewfinder is digitally rendered in low res from the larger LCD source it is preferable to using the large and better looking LCD screen on the back due to poor vision on my part.I like the way the camera feels in my hand and overall it seemed pretty solid except for the fact the lens cap does not snap on but rather just pushes on and can fall off easily.I have had no trouble taking pictures, adjusting parameters or uploading to my computer for printing and more permanent storage.  The auto focus fails intermittently and you can never be sure if your image will be in focus OR properly exposed.  I found much of the automatic features to be unnecessary bells and whistles as many of them do not work properly or dependably. Of course the full manual is only available to view on a device that will display it in PDF format. You get a small quick start guide that barely covers the basics. Par for the course these days.So why have I given it a low rating?  The answer is simple... VERY POOR BUILD QUALITY!  This thing is NOT made to be used with the included micro USB cable. The jack in the camera itself is just plain flimsy and not up to the job. I knew the minute I saw it that this would prove to be a problem.  And since it is the only way to get things out of the camera short of taking out the memory card each and every time, I feel this is inexcusable and a MAJOR design flaw.I am EXTREMELY careful with all my electronics and the jack withstood no more than 30 uses before virtually disintegrating inside the camera.  Using this miniscule connector type was their first mistake. I know it is industry standard for a lot of brands but is sucks, plain and simple! Can you imagine a light switch in your home only standing up to 30 uses before it fell apart, or a drawer on your Blu Ray player falling off after loading 30 different discs?Also, the battery door which also is used to access the memory card slot is flimsly , fussy and just plain poorly implemented. It is the next thing ready to go out on this camera.  I can still use it by removing the memory card and plugging it into a card reader to access my pictures, but that takes more time and is much more physically invasive to the already flimsy design of the camera. Just another thing ready to break.Basically, when you purchase something THIS expensive you tend to expect you can accomplish the most basic functions without fear of 'wearing it out' before 6 months have passed.  I have no reason to suspect or believe that a replacement camera would have any better build quality on those two crucial areas and now wish I would have purchased a Panasonic Lumix or some such model. They cost much less but are known for a robust build quality with great results.In future I will avoid Fuji film products and spend a bit more time researching my camera purchases. As nice as this camera initially appeared to be, and as good as some of my results have been, I still consider this thing a real piece of junk and I am totally unhappy with it.  (and of course it quit on me during the Thanksgiving Holiday which added extra insult to injury)  If you want something DEPENDABLE, I would firmly suggest you look elsewhere.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "More for your money", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R1SZ0NMYWYV1Z9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just paid $176.00 for this Fujifilm camera.

It takes video to! People are complaining about how the pictures come out blurry, and it needs an SD card etc. Well  first of all most cameras need SD cards and most cameras don't come with them.Second of all if it's not taking good pictures then that means you have to FOCUS it. Once its focused your pictures will be perfect! The price of it is so cheap for the quality! The zoom is great so you can get each detail the flash is nice and it takes FABULOUS video as well.

ZOOM.. the video picks it up.. Breathe too deep.. the camera picks it up.  Flaw from design.Using the dial to select the settings can get confusing at times.. if you are in a hurry.. you may miss something.Focus Focus Focus... sometimes when you think your pictures is in focus, and you review them later.... not so happy.

I have some cams that zoom better, but this more of a high end point and shoot (meaning you cant exchange the lenses)  so please take care and get closer if you can.Overall:I have had about five other camera, and this one has only been beat by one ( No I wont say what is it because this review is about this camera, but if you mail and ask I will tell you... if its that important to you)  I plan to use it often, and I have not reached the limit of what I can do with this one.

Ault", "ReviewID": "R3Q2WFI6X5DEEC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I already had a Fujifilm Finepix S1500, but the longer zoom range and higher resolution of the S2800HD seemed to make it a better choice for some specific tasks we had in mind; chief among them was taking pictures of small items for posting on the website.  Sadly, that's the one place where this camera requires the most fiddling to get good results.  When used in the Macro and Super-Macro (close-up and extreme close-up) modes, the autofocus is often useless in the SR-AUTO mode; it will indicate that the shot is ready to take when the focus is not sharp at all, and it often takes several half-presses of the shutter button to get it to produce a non-fuzzy image in the viewfinder. If put into the other \"auto\" mode (denoted by a cryptic small red camera icon on the mode selector knob) the macro focusing becomes far more reliable, but still less than perfect. If you leave it in SR-AUTO mode by mistake, it's possible to cope to an extent by backing off away from the subject a bit so that the autofocus has a better chance to resolve the image.  The autofocus  does much better with light-colored, high-contract subjects than with dark things that have little detail, more so than a lot of other autofocus cameras I've used.  And the time required for the autofocus to home in on the right point (which it often misses, in fact) is still too long to expect quick responsiveness when shooting a moving subject.  The bottom line is that this isn't exactly point-and-shoot in that area, and since it has no manual focus capability at all, this is a real disadvantage.  Coupled with the fact that the super-macro (extreme close-up) is very limited, I have to downrate this model pretty strongly in its focusing.  Particularly annoying is the fact that its closest physical approach in super-macro is allowed only in ultra-wide zoom, which isn't very useful at all.Another place that it doesn't shine is in taking long telephoto images without bright light.  The amount of visual \"noise\" in the image is considerable when the shot is taken in this manner.  If you set it to use the flash to increase the fill-in light in the shadows, that can sometimes be reduced or eliminated, assuming that the subject is close enough for the flash to matter - but possibly at the expense of having the lighting as you would have wanted it.In general outdoor daylight shooting, though, its ability to correctly identify scene characteristics is usually pretty darned good - though overall, I find it produces better results in general if the SR-AUTO mode is simply avoided.  For indoor usage when taking shots of people, it's pretty good at automatically suppressing the redeye problem.While it may not have been the absolute best choice for what I needed, it does enough things well that I won't say it's best avoided, but there are clearly a lot of better choices available.  Most people would probably find it entirely acceptable for casual snapshot work, particularly for things like vacation scenery.Followup:  The camera had to go back for repair under warranty twice, the second time because the zoom didn't work after the first repair.  Overall, my opinion of Fuji has not been left in the same condition as it was before I bought this unit.

I was very excited to see it and for the price as well. Without my knowledge my employee took up a collection from my staff and presented it to me for Christmas 2011. I was thrilled and started taking pictures right away. The quality wasn't good but I told myself its more advanced and I needed to study the owners manual and get educated on it.

All other aspects suck!!!!!Picture quality is poor, zooming in and taking pictures is a joke. Whether inside or outside the noise on the pictures ruins most shots.

That is, I need to know that 99% of the time the pictures I take will be clear and in focus. I am an auto mode, P&S; type of photographer, and I have no desire to learn all the various manual functions or the artistic features. I just want a good picture, and, at times, the telephoto function is must.However, with this camera, in-focus shots happen about 80% of the time, and that is a deal breaker. I always ensure I have a yellow [+] in my viewer, which indicates a focused picture, hold the camera very still, and wait a second or two after the shutter clicks. Still, about 1 in 5 pictures will be out of focus, which is not always discernable on the viewer. Also, at times, the telephoto shots are grainy. My workaround is to take two or three shots of every scene, and on a typical appraisal I'll take 70 or 80 photos.I've had the camera for over a year now.

Mean time my wife is clicking away with no idea of what she's doing and her photos were great. I had to constantly adjust exposure using manual mode. The other problem, no hot shoe.

I would say they probably wil be kicked off digital camera market in near future, which is sad, as they have been accounted for some really great cameras in a past.I tried number of fuji cams and all of them, have bad fuzzy jpegs even in bright sunlight, primitive image control, very poor dynamic range.

Have you ever heard of 'blue rain'?  The cameras lack of low light sensitivity has it compensating to make the picture brighter, but that results in a lot of blue on the screen.  If you don't use the flash, the picture that you take has a lot of blue in it as well.If you use the zoom while taking a video, the motor noise for the zoom is very VERY loud in the video!!!  Louder than what you hear when using it.One day I pointed the camera at my daughter sitting at the kitchen table with a bright day outside through the window behind her.  The result was streaks of light from the window into the dark areas below and no, this was not lens flare as there was no direct light shining inside the house.If you want a camera that you know you won't be taking any of the pictures in the settings I have described above, then by all means, knock yourself out.
