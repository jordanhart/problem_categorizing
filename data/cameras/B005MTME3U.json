{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Truly Pocketable Camera", "Author": "Sheraz A. Choudhary", "ReviewID": "R4R2PZQ0TBH32", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I owned five Powershot S Series (s30,s50,s60,s80,s90) cameras prior to purchasing the s100.  I took close to 100,000 photos with my s90 in the two years that I owned it.  I am a semi-professional photographer that owns multiple Canon EOS DSLR cameras with L lenses.First off,  I don't think it's fair to compare the s100 to DSLRs, APS-C, Four Thirds cameras.  These large sensor cameras are in another class and even my really old Canon 10D with 6MPs will at low ISO have better image quality than the s100.  If you don't mind a larger camera that is not pocketable and are willing to spend more, the s100 is not the best camera for you.  For example, the Sony NEX-5N will give superior results to the s100 in nearly all situations.The s90, s95 and now s100 are all unique in that the are truly pocketable--all the competitors are too large for pant pockets (Panasonic LX5, Olympus XZ-1, FujiFilm X10).  Some of these cameras are quite good and all of them provide faster lenses across the zoom range (the s100's size precludes a faster zoom lens).  But none of these competitors are comfortably pocketable--this means that the s100 has practically no competition for it's size as a truely pocketable semi-pro camera.If you don't need the manual control, the Canon 300HS will also take great pictures for less than half the price in a smaller/slimmer camera body.  The s100 does have a great AUTO mode and multiple Scene modes which in most situations does an excellent job.  But shooting both the s100 and 300HS in AUTO will lead to very similar results.  The s100 differentiates itself by providing excellent manual control and the ability to shoot RAW images.Now if you are someone that wants pant pocketable camera with excellent manual controls and image quality, the s100 is very hard to beat.  I take ten times more shots with my s100 than my DSLRs because I ALWAYS have it with me.If you already have a s90 or s95, there is little need to upgrade to the s100 immediately.  The s100 has some worthy upgrades (24mm, GPS, better designed body) but the image quality is near identical to the s95/s90.  My s90 took many falls and goo in an airplane pocket killed the flash otherwise i'd stay with the s90.  I have now taken close to 1500 photos with the s100 and here are my experiences of it's pros and cons:PROS:* The s100 is cleaner at high ISO (eg 1600 and above) but the difference isn't as substantial as Canon claims (for low ISO, there is no difference in noise)* s100 is even slimmer than the s95 which is was already quite pocketable* GPS is a great addition and quite accurate most of the time* rough texture finish makes the camera easier to hold and also looks great* rubber grips make camera easier to hold but don't expect miracles* mirror like shutter button is easier to find especially given the removal of the func button from the top of the camera* back wheel now has the perfect resistance and feedback* the delete button is not on the dial so I can finally delete while viewing a zoomed in on an image!!!* lens zooms very quickly (sometimes too quickly to get accurate zoom)* fast shutter speed (in fact in Continuous drive mode it is very difficult to take one photo--always get two photos and I am fairly fast releasing the shutter button--an additional slower Continuous mode option would have been helpful)* 8 shots in a second is a handy feature to have though not often used (limited to 8 shots and then have to wait for the photos to be written to the card)* 24mm wide-angle is very useful for indoor photography* lens is sharper across zoom range than the s90--with sharper corners (people have reported variation in the sharpness of the lens on early models)* ability to control max ISO and ISO selection criteria for Auto ISO* dynamic range correction works well* dedicated movie recording button* 1080p video recording (much better resolution but not as good low light capture than s90&s95; but can't match Sony HX-9V)* can zoom while recording video with minimal noiseCONS:* all Canons Point&Shoots; have slower focus especially in the dark.  The s100 is comparable or slightly slower than the s90.  Fuji and Sony have made strides to provide faster focus and I hope Canon follows.  Set shortcut button to Focus-lock to pre-focus--once focus is locked the s100 is really fast* NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHERS: a major con for me is that the s100 is locked to ISO80 for shutter speeds over 1sec.  May not matter to most people but I loved shooting 15sec ISO400 shots with my s90* The display does not brighten as much in a dark room making composition more difficult.  The s90 shows a very grainy but bright image in a near dark room where the s100's display is very dark (also if multiple shots are taken with the shutter button half pressed the display is darker for the subsequent shots)* The s100 is better in high-ISO short shutter speed situations but the s90 is better for long shutter speed photography* Auto mode is limited to 1/8 (have to switch to P mode if you don't want to use a flash in a dim room)* HDR requires a tripod because camera does not align images (given the tech Canon really should auto-align the images).* battery life slightly worse than s90 (buy a second battery--I had three for my s90)* fast zoom with steps sometimes makes it difficult to get the exact zoom desired* Movies are great in well-lit areas but have a lot less gain than the s90 resulting in hi-res but darker movies* Sony's panoramics are fantastic and Canon is still using same approach as it did in the s30 in 2001!* always open flash if it is needed before handing the camera to anyone else.  Everyone initially presses down on the flash resulting in a flash error.* price but you get what you pay forUPDATE 03/25/2012: Had to call Canon Support for the first time in a decade (lens error on s100).  Discovered, that you have to pay to mail back the camera to their facility in Virginia and be without a camera and wait 2 weeks to get it back.  Maybe I have been spoiled by the excellent warranty Amazon provides for it's products.UPDATE 05/31/2012: My Canon Service Center experience was much better than I expected.  They kept me informed on each step of the process and got the camera back to me within a week.  Yes, I had to pay to mail the camera to Canon and be without the camera for a week but the overall experience was excellent.  (Have taken over 12,000 photos with S100 and still love it).SONY RX100 Announcement 06/05/2012:  Sony has just announced what I consider to be the first pocketable camera that delivers better features and image quality than the Canon S95/S100.  The only major con against the RX100 is that it costs $650.  For that price you get a larger sensor, better iso performance, better video, much better auto focus, better features, ect.  If price is not a concern the RX100 which will be released in July is the best pocketable camera to get based on early impressions of reviews and image quality comparisons.  Sony DSC-RX100 20.2 MP Exmor CMOS Sensor Digital Camera with 3.6x ZoomUPDATE 09/18/2012: The Canon S110 [[...]] was announced yesterday and is mostly unchanged from the S100 with the following notable changes: Wi-fi functionality, touchscreen, GPS functionality removed, presumably faster focus.  Will cost $450.I will soon update this review to update it based on the options available today since there have been a number of changes in this camera segment in the last year.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Point and Shoot and Worthy Successor to S95", "Author": "AudioFan", "ReviewID": "RLJLDGUII3KDH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At the time of this writing the S100 was just released. I recently bought the S95 on the recommendation of a friend who is an avid photographer, thinking the S100 would not be released until much later. The S100 just started showing up in stores so I bought it as well, intending to return one of the cameras. So I had the opportunity to compare them both!To preface, I'm an intermediate level photographer, and it is just a hobby. I do own a DSLR, but it is one of the lower end models in the DSLR world. Still, I have become comfortable with manual adjustments and own a few lenses for it. However the majority of my pictures end up being taken with the camera most conveniently at hand (iPhone), and in this case I was looking for something that could offer a big step up in image quality without having to carry the larger DSLR.Both the S95 and S100 are excellent cameras. However, there are key points about the S100 that give it the advantage. The rubber grips on the front and back are excellent. The flash pops up on both the S95/S100 where you would naturally place your left hand. Having the rubber grips for your right hand allows this to be a one-handed camera, or at least allows better support with the right hand since the left hand may not be able to rest where it feels most natural, which for me tends to involve a finger resting on top of the flash. This is an issue for both the S95 and S100, but the S100 mitigates it by having better support for the right hand - the rubber grips and better shutter button position. More on that next.The shutter button is larger on the S100. This feels more natural and easier to access. Also the position of the shutter button has been moved more towards the right edge. It may seem small but this is a big improvement. If you have shorter fingers you may find it more difficult to naturally reach the shutter button on the S95 than the S100. The shutter button on the S95 is just a bit too far from the right edge for my taste, making it a bit difficult to reach when bending your shooting finger to press the button. Canon certainly recognized that as evidenced by the new location of the shutter button on the S100.The buttons on the rear of the camera have been changed, including having a single-press button to start shooting a video. This is great since most videos for me involve catching fleeting moments of my kids in action. On the S95 you need to turn the mode selection dial to movie mode first. Regarding video, the S100 also allows zooming in/out while shooting a movie. As I understand it, the S95 did not allow that.The processor has been upgraded and the S100 does feel slightly faster because of it when navigating through menus.I took comparison shots in my home using both cameras and I found a slight advantage for the S100 in terms of image quality. There was a bit more detail using the S100, but honestly it wasn't significant. Still, in my head-to-head tests the S100 was the winner.For me the main difference is in terms of the user interface. The button layout is better on the S100 and the addition of the grips is helpful. This camera feels easier to shoot because of this. This may seem small, but all of these button layout changes and grip additions add up to a camera that overall is more convenient for me to shoot. That's why I chose the S100. This is, after all, my camera of convenience.The only downside I found for the S100 is that it is priced higher than the S95.If you are on a budget and tried the S95 and like how it feels, then get it. You will be very happy with it! The pictures were very similar in quality between the two, and the S95 is a high quality camera. Everything about it mechanically boasts of durability and quality. But if the price difference is not an issue then I recommend the S100.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "LENS ERROR", "Author": "Par4DaCourse", "ReviewID": "RIHF0K93Y8ZV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I began getting a lens error.  This disables the camera from taking photos.  At first, it was very infrequent and intermittent, but got worse.  It didn't gradually get worse, but in giant leaps.  I returned it to Canon for repair.  They sent it back saying it was fixed.  It worked for one day, then the lens error came back 100% of the time, worse than ever.  I sent it back asking for a new one, but the Canon rep said that they had to look at it first.  Now, I have to wait a couple more weeks.  My expectations of Canon product and service quality were definitely not met.UPDATE May 4, 2012:  I got it back.  It took 2 1/2 weeks.  I popped in the battery and SD card, powered up and guess what...  lens error.  Lens stuck in the open position.  Took out the battery, put it back in and powered up again.  Problem gone.  Turned it off and on about a dozen times.  Still no problems.  Took out the battery, put it back in and powered up again. Turned it off and on a few more times.  No problems.  But that initial lens error gives me absolutely no confidence that the problem will not come back.UPDATE May 5, 2012:  LENS ERROR.  AUGH!!!UPDATE:  May 24, 2012:  A couple weeks ago, I sent my camera in to the Canon service center for the 3rd time.  I wrote a detailed description of the problem and requested that the technician contact me when making the repair.  Also called and emailed customer support explaining how frustrating this problem is and I wanted to make sure that they took extra care in repairing this camera.  No contact from the technician.  Received camera yesterday.  Turned it on this morning, worked fine.  Turned it on this afternoon.  LENS ERROR!  Turned it on tonight, LENS ERROR again.UPDATE June 1, 2012:  I returned the camera (for the 4th time).  This time, Canon shipped me a new unit and I received it yesterday.  This morning, it worked perfectly.  I'll use it for a month and post an update.UPDATE July 9, 2012:  So far so good.  NO lens error.  It turns out that that the camera that I had originally had a serial number that Canon stated was susceptible to lens error, especially in hot humid environments like where I live.  With that said, the photos are excellent for a compact camera.  I especially like the color and clarity.  Excellent good low light capabilities (again, for a compact camera).  I've even used the video and found it to be very good. I am very pleased with the replacement camera, but I'm leaving the rating at one star so that people are aware that there is a series of serial numbers to avoid (1st 2 digits beginning with 29 through 41).", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "A disappointing change from the s95, still a solid camera", "Author": "M. rogers", "ReviewID": "R196DFG8J2HKU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera, in my opinion, isn't nearly as good as the s95. However, it does have its positives, namely its user interface, wide angle lens and aesthetics.A very surprising positive for this item, is the user interface, specifically the button layout on the back of the unit. Canon reduced the total number of buttons and moved them around. Shockingly, I immediately adjusted to the new layout and found it very hard to return the unit, mostly due to the buttons' ease. After years of Canon's old layout, I am still amazed that I adjusted in less than a week to the new layout.The unit also features a rear thumb rest and front grip, combined with a less slick and more textured finish, the unit feels much better in your hand than the s95 ever did.The s100 features a 24mm lens vs. the 28mm lens of the s95. That is a huge improvement in wide angle shooting and creating more life-like scenes.Unfortunately, that's where the good ends on this camera. For me, the biggest issue is the awful white balance of this unit. As we all know, a big selling point of this point and shoot, is the 'bright' f/2.0 aperture lens. The s95 absolutely excels in low light shots, creating nearly 'professional' quality photos. I took a series of low/ambient light shots with both cameras on the same settings, under the same conditions and the results were absolutely night and day. The shots with the s95 came out bright and light, the s100 shots came out orange and dark. With a huge adjustment to the white balance, the s100 shots looked ALMOST as good as the s95 shots. When viewed on a monitor at 100% the shots lost a large amount of clarity and contrast.Canon 'upgraded' the CCD sensor of the s95 to a CMOS sensor. Apparently they've never heard the phrase 'if it's not broken, don't fix it.' Also, if you zoom to 28mm, the aperture goes to f/2.2, which is 'dimmer' than the s95 at 28mm.With these gripes aside, the s100 is still a solid performer. It just isn't an improvement over the s95. The bottom line is that the aesthetic improvements and wide angle lens do not make up for the white balance/darkness issues when shooting in low/ambient light. Canon, you messed up on this one.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lens Error(s)!!", "Author": "Patrick McGovern", "ReviewID": "R1EYTRKDV1POP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've been a big Canon lover over the years.  I've had 4 DSLR's and some pocket size cameras like the S95 and now the S100.  Loved the S95.  When the S100 arrived at our house, we were very excited to test it out during a trip to Las Vegas.  After a few pictures in Vegas, my wife started to get Lens errors.  (I checked on Google and learned that a lot of people were getting these errors).  No problem, I thought, everyone gets a bad piece of electronics every once in a while....and I've had good luck with Canon  I sent the S100 to Canon for repair.  It took about 3 weeks from the time I sent it to them until the time I got it back.  They claimed they replaced the optics and it was a warranty repair.  My wife and I started taking a few pictures.  We got about 10 pictures in with the \"Repaired Camera\", when we started seeing the SAME Lens Error!!  Very frustrating.  The S100 has been re-sent to Canon for repair.  It's been about three weeks and  I'm still waiting for the camera to arrive.  I dont' have high hopes that it will be fixed this time around.  At this point, I just want a new camera to replace this lemon.Update: 6-20-12:Received the camera back.  Canon forgot to return the battery (even though it stated in their paperwork that we had sent them a battery) .  Had to call support to have them send another battery.  3 days later.  Received battery.  Put battery in camera, turned it on.  Lens Error!!  Same Error after two full repair trips.  Arrrgh.Update: 7-10-12Received camera back (3rd time from Canon repair).  It appears they actually did something this time.  I'm about 50 pictures in, and it continues to work.  More testing is needed...but this is already 49 pictures more then the previous two repairs.  Keeping my fingers crossed.  :D  If it turns out I have another lens error...I'll provide an update to this review.Update 1-7-13Well...we had a good run there for about 6 months.  Took a lot of images and no issues...  but... went to Mexico for the holidays and the Lens Error is back.  We managed to get 2 days worth of pictures of the trip...and then it started failing.  Good thing the iphone5 takes good pictures, otherwise we wouldn't have pictures for much of the trip.  I'm at a loss what to do next.

Goodier", "ReviewID": "RDSFRTZP71JLM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm writing this review because these are two of the higher-end pocketable Canon cameras and you may debate between which is better for you. I've owned the S100 for 3 weeks/300 pics now and have had the SX230HS for 7 months and taken 1,000s of pictures with it.They are both great cameras and you will, no doubt, be happy with either. They both have full manual controls, shoot 1080p video, and are very similar in size.To me, there are two obvious differences that matter:1. Zoom! The SX230HS clearly wins out in the long zoom competition. 14X vs.  5X on the S100. Does this really matter? To me: not so much. In my experience, I shoot 90% of my pictures at the widest possible focal length and aperture. Even the pictures where I zoom, 5X covers just about everything else.Does this mean the 14X zoom doesn't have value? No. Some things are cool, like zooming in on the ball drop in Times Square, or reading some far away sign. Keep in mind that using that much zoom is limited to fixed subjects in very good lighting. Anything else will be blurry due to you or the subject moving during the relatively long exposure.2. ISO noise. This one is not obvious to all camera buyers yet, but once you know what it is, it becomes the most important feature. I have posted some 100% crop photos here with side by side comparisons of a ruler and a flat wall. I like this test because it shows both noise and smoothing processes that remove fine detail.So how do they compare? The S100 is much better than the SX230 as you can see from the test shots. The S100 has more detail (numbers and lines on the ruler) and less noise (splotchyness).There are purists out there that will say you can't compare the two because the S100 has a DIGIC 5 vs. the DIGIC 4 in the SX230 and they are using different noise reduction strategies. That doesn't change the fact that I greatly prefer the noise reduction on the S100 and I think the detail is retained better as well.Also aiding the S100 is a wider aperture f/2.0 vs f/3.1 (1.3 stops). This gives you the ability to use a faster shutter speed at the same ISO to reduce motion blur. Or use lower iso for less noise at the same shutter speed.Conclusion:I'll take the better noise handling over the zoom.The superior S100 Image Quality (IQ) makes this my primary camera for almost all situations now. The zoom on the SX230 just doesn't come into play enough where I would get more benefit from it over better IQ on the S100.Star rating:Why do I give it 4 start instead of 5? Cons listed by other users:Long exposures are stuck to ISO 80 and 15 seconds max, HDR needs a tripod, battery life (though I got a cheap battery on Amazon, works well).Hope this helps.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "I got a second copy, it's much better", "Author": "Richard Wanderman \"rwanderman\"", "ReviewID": "R3119J5Q308YQP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have the S100, had the S95 and S90 before it and took magnificent images with both S90 and S95. I'm a professional photographer, have both a Canon 5D and 5D2 and many high end L lenses. I've had many Canon Elphs before the S series as well as various G series bodies.The S90 was a spectacular camera, the S95 improved on it and I was very much looking forward to this camera because of improvements with ergonomics and the extra 4mm in wide angle at 24mm. In fact, I find distortion on the edges of 24mm unacceptable and have zoomed to 28 for much of what I've done with this camera.I have not taken a sharp picture yet with this camera and I have plenty of experience with both this line of cameras and with photography in general. I don't know what's causing the blurriness, probably not the CMOS sensor, more likely the lens, but I agree with others giving this camera a less than wonderful review that the IQ in the S100 is not up to snuff. It may be a copy to copy issue, I don't know.Time will tell if this is a copy to copy issue (a few bad apples) or something affecting all copies of this camera. I do know that I'm not going to keep the copy I have, I'm returning it and have ordered (re-ordered) an S95 as they're quite inexpensive now at $229.If Canon comes out with a statement about this and explains that it was a few bad apples I'll re buy the camera in a second, it's exactly the camera I want and if the IQ is just as good as the S90 and S95 I'll be happy as the ergonomics have improved considerably.Update:I ordered a second copy of this camera from Amazon and the problems of the first are completely gone. I'm guessing it's a problem copy to copy with some lenses.I particularly like having a 24mm lens in this camera and the extra 4mm of wide are very meaningful for what I use this camera for (hiking, landscape images). It's macro mode allows closer focusing than the S95, it will shoot at higher ISO with less noise, or, another way to put that is at the same ISO it exhibits less noise than the S95. The ergonomics of the buttons and case have been improved considerably and I'm now quite happy with this camera. I was able to buy (re-buy) an S95 for $229 on Amazon when they were discounted heavily during the holidays and I'll keep that camera as a travel backup but I plan to use the S100 as my primary hiking and travel camera now, the images I'm getting from it are excellent.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "S100 vs S95", "Author": "Tiger", "ReviewID": "R5VEABKORLT9K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been seeking an affordable camera which will give high quality photos and video clips for both home and work purposes. During the past week, I have closely compared the S100 to the S95 by taking a series of approximately sixty photos and five videos at various locations using the same shooting conditions whenever possible for both cameras. Afterwards, the photos and videos were compared on a 27-inch monitor. Here are a few of my observations. Both cameras gave excellent outdoor photos during a clear, sunny day. However, on my large monitor, the S100 gave comparably excellent indoor photos in either auto or P mode even when zoomed while the S95 showed more overall graininess particularly when zoomed or in low light. Although the photo image quality for both cameras was excellent, the video image quality was different. Out of fairness, it is important to note that the S100 will shoot 1080p HD video whereas the S95 is only capable of shooting 720p HD video. Thus, it is not surprising that the S100's HD video image quality was improved compared to the S95's. However, in addition, the S100 gave smoother video playback with good autofocus even when zooming. More astonishing was the ability of the S100 to give excellent video quality under a wide range of indoor lighting conditions while the S95 gave bright purple lines on both the LCD and in video playback when it was near various types of long-life incandescent light bulbs. The bright purple lines were reproducible, observed near three light bulbs in my house, and made some of the S95 video clips completely unusable. (I do not know if my copy of the S95 was defective.) Since I will use my new camera for work-related photos and videos, too, the purple lines on the S95 were unacceptable to me. The battery life of the S100 seemed poor during the first charge/discharge cycle. I did try the GPS, and while it worked, it drained the battery more quickly than expected. With neither the GPS nor its logger on, the battery life is more tolerable now that I am past the first couple of charge/discharge cycles, but I plan to have a spare battery with me at all times when I use the S100. Based on all of my tests, the features of the S100 are excellent for its size. The photo images seemed to have greater clarity on my big monitor than those from the S95, and the S100's video quality is much improved over the S95. My only complaint is that the S100 is a power hungry little camera, and I think that Canon's design engineers should consider a longer-lasting battery even if it makes the camera a little larger. I am now a very happy S100 owner, and I am glad that I took the time to do my photo and video tests. The battery issue is the only reason I gave the S100 four stars instead of five. It is worth noting that owners of both the S95 and S100 will benefit from learning to use the different shooting modes as well as knowing about options available in the recording and function menus. In addition to Canon's User Manual, there are a couple of excellent books specific to using the S95 that are also helpful for learning how to get the best quality photos and videos from the S100. Search \"S95\" at any bookstore to find them. One of these books has recently been updated for the S100:  \"Photographer's Guide to the Canon PowerShot S100\" by A.S. White.Update:  Since several reviewers have observed S100 photos that were entirely out of focus or had edges that were out focus, I reexamined selected photos for the S95 and S100.  For this examination, my 27-inch monitor was set at a screen resolution of 2560 x 1440, which is the highest available setting.  In addition, I zoomed in on the photos so that only 8.3% (1/12th) of an overall photo filled the screen.  For each photo, all four edges were carefully examined for clarity and compared to the center.  The photos selected for examination had considerable detail in them.  Some had pine needles, tree branches, bridge trestles, and buildings near the edges.  Others had wallpaper designs, signs, and posters with words printed on them.  (No low light or zoomed photos were selected.)  With only 8.3% of the photos filling the entire screen of my 27-inch monitor, the images on my copy of the S100 were uniform in clarity all the way out to the edges and corners.  For the selected photos, the images on my copy of the S95 were similarly uniform in clarity everywhere except for the lower right corner.  Surprisingly, the lower right corner was consistently blurry in multiple photos.  It is worth noting that with only 8.3% of the photos filling the entire screen, both cameras gave slightly fuzzy images, but when entire photos were visible, each camera gave sharp, clear images.  Some reviewers have complained about the LCD screen, too.  When I was comparing the S95 to the S100, I did note that the LCD image on the S95 was more pleasing than the image on the S100.  While I was considering this, I got out my old Canon PowerShot SD550 and compared the image on its LCD screen with that on the S100 and S95.  Next I compared each image with the real-life objects each camera was supposed to be depicting.  With the LCD screen in the default setting for each camera, the images on both the SD550's and S100's screens showed colors that were more faithful to real life while the image on the S95's screen appeared more vivid than real life.  It is worth noting that the screen brightness can easily be changed for indoor or outdoor photos.  There are five brightness settings available on the S100.  I assume that these settings are available on the S95, too.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Big disappointment", "Author": "Andre060 \"Andre\"", "ReviewID": "RU0HCA828LZGO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was really excited for this camera - there are very few in this market segment, a small compact camera intended for enthusiasts.

I'm not sure if the lens on mine was bad or whatnot, but both the left and right edges were blurry in pretty much all pictures I took. This includes brain-dead easy things to shoot, like the facade of buildings in sunny conditions outdoors. On top of that, the images seem more noisy than I expected, even at the minimum ISO setting of 80.I've owned several Canon cameras over the last few years and this one is definitely a let-down in my mind. It went back to the store, and for now I'm going to keep my 1.5 year old Elph instead.*** UPDATE *** : The day after I tested the S100, I just borrowed my friend's S95 (the previous model in this line of cameras) and took the exact same test shots again. The facade of a building in the same exact conditions (clear skies, 2 hours before sunset). And I brought along my current compact, a canon SD780. The result was as expected: While not as sharp as a prime lens on an SLR, both the S95 and SD780 were reasonable shots with no obvious blurry sections. When you put them side-by-side with the S100 shots from the day before, the difference is absolutely obvious - the S100 shots look blurry to the point of being awful and almost unusable. This is not just me being a snobby camera nerd - any casual observer could see the difference quite easily.I would love to believe that I had a one-off example of a bad camera, but the DPReview preview of the S100 seems to indicate this problem is much more widespread than that. Get it together, Canon.

I suggest reading the in-depth review at dpreview.com, which is a bit more detached and objective than some of the negative reviews here. (This is only natural. Someone who has spent the money to buy a camera, and has been disappointed, will react less objectively than a reviewer who tests four sample cameras, compares their image quality, and doesn't have to spend money on any of them.)Personally I am satisfied with the lens on my sample of the S100, and I speculate that there were production problems in the first models to come off the line. You always run a risk by being an early adopter, especially if the model is brought to market hastily for the Christmas season, as this was.S95 owners will find just enough differences in the controls to be irritated by the S100. After a relearning process, however, I felt that the functional changes were improvements, especially when I want quick access to aperture/shutter speed, ISO, and exposure adjustment. I also appreciate the completely new features such as GPS and automatic dynamic range compression. And most of all I like the wider lens. I am not so thrilled by the rougher finish of the metal body and the finger/thumb grips, presumably included to satisfy users who complained that the S95 was too slippery. I liked the S95's totally clean styling.For those who never touched an S95 (or its predecessors), you have a treat in store: I consider this the most amazingly feature-packed pocket camera, besides being one of the smallest. Almost all the features from my full-size D5 mark II have been replicated here, and are fairly intuitively accessible. Or, of course, you can just set it to Auto. But that isn't why you want this camera, is it? The intended buyer, I think, is a fairly serious photographer who wants total feature-control in a package small enough to take anywhere, with minimal sacrifice of image quality. Yes, the small physical size of the 12MP sensor introduces some additional image noise compared with a full-frame camera, and you may miss the higher pixel count from time to time, but still--an incredible achievement, and very beautifully executed.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loved it, then it began failing", "Author": "William H.

Perhaps, if you are looking for the best pocket camera which takes awesome photos by just turning it on, pointing and shooting, this may not be the best choice (I suspect the canon 300 HS would be one of the best for this). But if you are looking for a camera capable of taking superb pictures with excellent picture quality that require just a little understanding of how to utilize the settings, or if you want a fantastic pocket camera which allows you to manipulate all the basic controls of an old, standard film-35mm, it is hard to imagine you could find better (though if you have the money and pocketability is not of supreme importance, the Fuji Film Fine Pix x100 would be my pick ... at $1200).I spent easily over 1 month doing research on all all sorts of cameras (various models of Lumix, Nikon, Sony, Olympus, other Canons, a couple of others and the FujiFilm) before i bought this. While in the end i am very happy with my selection, it took way too long for me to sort through all the customer reviews here, the professional reviews on CNET, DPReviews, Youtube, etc. The many reviews here on Amazon helped immensely in trying to make my choice, but I have to say I was a bit confused at first and then concerned by the extremes of comments (lots of 5 stars and a good bit of 1 star reviews). I am writing this for other Amazon users in order to help make sense of this situation. (just for reference, i am a visual artist and have a good amount of experience with photography and cameras.)1. the negative reviews are mostly because of a lens error problem which affected a good number of units of this model. fear not about this ... canon seems to have taken responsibility for this if you get one of these lemons (and in my experience with canon, they are very good with making good on their mistakes). most of the units with this problem were corrected (the S100's with a serial number beginning with numbers 29 through 41 are the ones seemingly affected by the error and most of these have been sold or recalled or fixed).2. most of the negative reviews regarding picture quality are absurd. if you just put the thing on \"auto\" and press the button and hope every picture is going to be great, you will likely be disappointed. this camera takes a little more getting to know than the typical pocket camera because it is more complex, but this allows you to be able to do things that most other cameras of this sort cannot do. you just have to invest a little time. PEOPLE SAYING THAT THE IMAGE QUALITY IS CRAP ARE ALL JUST WRONG - they just have not put the time into learning how to use this camera and use it properly. i was going from an old Powershot s500 that i LOVED. this was only 5 m-pixels, but it was easy to use and took really nice, balanced photos with great ease. when i first fired up the s100, i was a bit afraid that some of what was said about the picture quality was true, but after taking 20 or sometimes 30 pictures of the same thing in the same light, i was able to really understand the differences in what the settings and modes do and was able to get a feel for using the auto-modes as well as manipulating the ISO, aperture, and shutterspeed ... and i get not just great but SUPERB photos. now, after a couple of weeks, i sometimes still need to snap 3 or 4 pictures until i get one i like, but that photo is an excellent image ... one so much better than almost every compact camera i have ever seen (and with my research, i looked at buckets of sample photos from all sorts of cameras.pros:image quality - i looked at probably about 20+ compact cameras, their sample pictures and sample shots of all of them at different ISO's: this canon had the best image quality of all of them bar the pricey fujifilm x100 (which was gorgeous but this is also not really a compact camera). at ISO 800, the s100 retains more definition and colour saturation than all of the others (i think there was an olympus that came in close ).low-light shots - MOST PEOPLE THINK THE MEGA-PIXELS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE CAMERA ... NOT SO. while the s100 has ample m-pixels, it is all about the size of the sensor and the aperture range. this camera has one of the biggest sensors (7.44 x 5.58 ... and a good quality CMOS) and the low end the aperture goes down to 2.0, so you have the ability to take really nice low-light shots. also has a good (digic 5) processor.controlability - this camera allows you to control everything important in your photo; f-stop 2.0 - 5.9 has a great range for a camera this size, ISO 80 - 6400, and 1/2000 sec. - 15 sec. shutter speed. there really aren't other cameras that can give you this.macro capability - i have never seen a camera that can take pictures at 3 cm like this, maybe a couple of full size SLRs fitted with macro lenses, but he s100 goes beyond what i imagined even possible on a camera like thisdata readout - has  great data information  for each shot, as you line up the picture and after you have taken the shottons of options - too many for me actually, which i also think is a bit of a con; but you can always just not use the ones  you do not likelens ring - gives using the camera a nice sense of control that hearkens back to the old SLRsRAW - i am not a professional and RAW has little appeal to me other than post-production manipulation, but if you want, this shoots in RAW ... personally, i find that JPEGs frequently do better in avoiding colour moire in fine resolutionvideo quality - not even interested in video, but great qualitycons:new added finger grip on front - for me it does nothing and just jets a little in the wayno decent digital filtres - with all the stuff they stuck in this camera, you think they could have included some digital filtres ... i mean how often are you going to want to use the fish-eye or miniature landscape feature? cute, but i'd rather have some simple digi filtres.too may options - for some could be a plus, but for me there are too many things and features i would never use and some which are so complex i would not be able to remember how to access themlens ring sticking out - while i love the idea of the lens ring, its protruberance makes the camera just a bit more difficult to stuff in the pocketflash - before digital, i had 2 canon elph film cameras. one had a pop-up flash like this one; it broke. i almost did not buy this camera because of the pop-up flash. while this one seems so much better (it has a little motor that seems very tight and strong), i still fear i could break it. in the end, though, i am glad i got the camera because it is otherwise so great.if you still have any doubts, this is a great camera.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super improvement on an already great camera", "Author": "RonAnnArbor", "ReviewID": "R1C365OX1S8RKQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had the new S100 for a week now, have taken about 1000 shots in all conditions (day, night, low light, high light) and I have to say that this camera is just about perfect.

It readily fits in a jeans pocket, without the protruding lens that is a problem for many small cameras. Image Quality is very good, and it is perhaps one stop better at high ISOs than the S95.

I find ISO 2000 usable for most purposes, but it depends on your tolerance for image noise.Key strengths are the ability to pick your most used menu functions and put them in a shortlist of favorites, an even faster way of accessing one key function by assigning it to a handy ring around the lens, good low light performance, and most of all the small, handy size.No real weak points beyond those unavoidable in a small digicam, though I am not impressed with the battery life, claimed to be about 200 shots. I haven't rigorously checked that claim, but it is reasonable based on my experience so far. Not really a weak point,  but note that the claimed fast f/2 is available only at the widest focal length.

Buffington", "ReviewID": "R3N1I6WV1O9DOE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I suppose that I am \"late to the party\" regarding the Canon PS S100.  The S110 is already out as its replacement, and it is, of course, a fine camera.  The time finally came to replace my venerable Digital Elph S50, and I did an enormous amount of research trying to decide what to replace it with for my \"pocketable\" walk-around camera.  I tend to prefer Nikon for SLRs and Canon for small cameras (both are excellent), and my research continued to support the notion that Canon is right at the forefront for small cameras.Many recent reviewers have concentrated their reviews on comparing the S110 and the S100.  I mostly will not. Since I have been absent from the small camera market scene for seven years, this review will instead mostly dwell on the improvements of the S100 over the earlier models, which observations I hope that someone will find useful.  Very briefly, with respect to the excellent S110, for me the deciding factor in favor of the S100 are the analog controls and the non-presence of a touchscreen.  Ergonomically I like the big shutter button and the all-analog controls of the S100.  I tend to find touchscreen control of a camera non-intuitive; perhaps I am just a product of the baby-boomer generation.  To further date myself, I miss the optical viewfinder that used to be standard on cameras of this class.  Like almost all of its competition, the S100 uses the rear LCD as an electronic viewfinder.  This is the wave of the future and the S100 is no exception. I am adapting.Examining the S100 I can see that Canon has improved much over the earlier generation of cameras.  The first thing I am going to comment upon is the image quality -- it is very, very good.  Almost astounding, in fact for a camera of this size.  Digital SLRs of a decade ago would be hard-pressed to take on the S100.  Somehow Canon has squeezed a lot of performance out of the relatively small lens on the S100; partly due to its excellent sensor.  This camera will effortlessly produce excellent images even under difficult light conditions.  The image stabilization (\"IS\") feature (together with this camera's excellent high ISO performance) made it possible for me to take reasonably sharp photos of nighttime Christmas lights, which is something my older pocket cameras could never accomplish to my satisfaction.The next improvement that I found pleasing on the S100 is the user interface.  It is very intuitive.  Canon has knocked most or all of the rough edges off of its interface.  I found it very easy to quickly adapt to it, which was not true of my earlier Canon circa 2002.  The AUTO function allows the user to be taking pictures right out of the box in a matter of minutes.  The \"P\" (Program) mode has many more features but nevertheless is easy to figure out and master.  To my surprise both aperture and speed priority settings are right there on the top control dial, so users who wish to really control their photos, e.g. depth of field or action blurring shots,  will be at home with this camera.My final main observation concerning the S100 is its amazing feature set.  As noted above, it features both Program, Aperture, and Focus-priority settings. Like a full-blown SLR it allows center-weighted metering, \"evaluative\" metering, and spot metering.  It has a variety of different focusing modes.  It also has scene settings mode and a \"filter effects\" mode which allows a number of interesting effects such as B&W;, sepia, vivid colors, and other effects.  This camera allows the photographer to approach his or her shooting in a variety of different ways, and you really have to work at it to produce poor pictures with this camera.  The AUTO or Scene settings will allow the shooter to let the camera make most of the decisions or, alternatively, the camera allows about as much flexibility as an SLR camera.Using a 32GB SD card the S100 will take approximately 10,000 photos, depending upon whether the shooter elects to shoot RAW, JPEG, or RAW+JPEG.  Pretty amazing considering that only a decade or so ago we were all shooting 36 images on film and then paying ten dollars to get it developed so that we could see how our pictures turned out.  There is no reason other than backup to worry about one's images on any vacation with this camera.I elected to go with the black version of the S100 and I am well-pleased with it.  The black looks very snappy and professional.  The aluminum body has a nice anti-skid texture that is very pleasing to the eyes and to the touch, and there is a rubber grip on the front that further aids in gripping the camera.  The one issue as far as handling is concerned is that I do occasionally find my left hand blocking the pop-up flash at times.  You have to watch that with this camera.  Another nit: there is no recess or protective lip for the beautiful LCD viewfinder on the back of this camera.  Buying one of the after-market protective products is an absolute must if you wish to avoid scratching this screen.  Many are available and I recommend that users buy one at the same time as buying this camera.  Last nit: this camera is a bit of a battery hog.  Buying a spare battery is a good idea.  A must, in fact, for the serious photographer.The camera features a 24-120 zoom lens that is F 2.0 when wide open.  The lens becomes slower as you zoom in which is an inevitable trade-off for the smaller lens, but still, this is a fast lens for a camera of this class.  Experienced users will know that to take good portrait shots a little zooming in from 24mm is a good idea; otherwise human subjects will be distorted.  But for landscapes and other tight shots, 24mm is very nice to have.Canon has packed a lot of performance and features into the S100 and things have improved a lot since the last time I looked at the \"pocketable\" digital camera market.

I ended up getting her an s95. We both love the s95.  We took a few hundred pictures over the holidays and are very happy with the results; mostly indoor shots of our children.  I was pleasantly surprised by the responsiveness of the s95.  I read a handful of reviews stating the performance was below average. When I press the button the shutter seems almost instantaneous, even with the flash.Last week I found an s100 at Best Buy.  I assumed it was an s95 with better video and zoom.  My s95 was still within return policy so I purchased the S100.  After taking about 200 shots I knew the S100 was not for me.  While it does have better video and zoom, these do not offset all the disadvantages compared to the s95. First the LCD screen is very dull.  The s95's LCD is bright and vibrant, and very visible in low-light.  I can barely see the LCD on the s100 in low-light.  Also, if you zoom on the s100 and move it to track a subject the LCD becomes a blurry mess.  The LCD on the S95 stays relatively clear when tracking a subject.The deal breaker for me was indoor shots with moderate light.  I suspect (going by reviews) the s100 does better at ISO 1600 and above, but I almost never go above 400.  I found the pictures on the s95 to be sharper and have better color under the same conditions.  The difference was not significant, but the s100 should at least been on par since it cost over $120 than the s95.  The s95 also fired faster when using the flash.  I found the s95 more responsive under all conditions (except burst mode).I do like the design of the S100, but the build quality seems below the s95.  The s95 feels very solid while the s100 more hollow.  The added rubber on the front and back is a welcome addition to the s100.  It definitely helps your grip when shooting with one hand.Overall I am just disappointed.  I was so excited about getting the S100.  I thought it was going to be exactly what I wanted after using the s95.  If the s100 was about $250 I think it would be a decent value, but $429 is ludicrous.  If you are looking for a compact camera with close to professional quality get the s95 while you still can.  Maybe I just got a bad one, but I am not exchanging it for another.

Since this setup is rather large and heavy I have been trying to find a good solution to photograph non-bird subjects such as landscapes/scenery/habitats, people, buildings and whatever else I encounter that a 500mm lens isn't good for capturing.I started off by purchasing an EF-s 10-22mm lens for this but I found that while I really liked the wide angle capabilities of this lens I really wanted more focal length than this lens offered so eventually purchased an EF-s 15-85mm IS lens. This lens was still wide enough to do most of the photography I wanted to do and offered me the extra focal length that I wanted. Both of these lenses are in my opinion excellent. However, after using them for a few years I found that I am still missing tons of photos that I would have liked to have taken because either of these lenses is still more than I want to carry around when I am out birding.After searching the various options I eventually purchased a used Canon S90 compact. I liked the idea that it could be used manually, it had reasonably good image quality, and most of all that it was small enough to fit in my pocket so I could carry it with me everywhere.What I wasn't so thrilled about with the S90 was that operation was a bit sluggish (compared to the SLR I was used to), the lens could only go as wide as a 28mm field of view and that the image quality wasn't quite up to what I really wanted. I know that it isn't reasonable to expect SLR image quality in a small compact camera but I am trying to find a compromise I am happy with and the S90 wasn't quite there.One issue that I wasn't expecting with the S90 was that as I carried the camera around in my pocket the rear LCD screen got quite scratched up and more importantly lots of dust accumulated inside of the camera. The dust eventually started affecting the image quality and I was never able to completely clean it out despite taking the camera apart and cleaning the sensor and as much of the inside of the lens as I could reasonably get to.When the Canon S100 was announced I was excited to see that the focal length range had been expended to 24mm equivalent at the wide end and GPS had been added. Before I purchased the S100 I had been carrying around a GPS logger in my pocket and the GPS feature on the S100 might be able to eliminate one more thing that I had to carry around with me and charge each night.I waited a while to see what the reviews were like and was very disappointed by early reports of decreased image quality (compared to the S90/S95) and issues with the lens. Despite the initial reports my curiosity got the best of me and I ordered the S100. It arrived just in time to take on a birding trip to California, which I just concluded. So the following are my reactions of 10 days of using the S100 in the field and post processing my images.At the start of the trip I turned on the GPS function but kept the GPS logger function turned off. Each time I took the camera out to take a photo it took a long time for the camera to lock onto the GPS signal. Even when standing outside in plain view of a clear blue sky it would sometimes take more than 10 minutes. I read the manual to try to figure out if I was doing something wrong and tried the measures listed there but none seemed to help. It wasn't long before I figured out that to really get any practical use out of the GPS function the logger function must be on. The advantage was that the camera will almost instantly lock onto the signal recording GPS data in the photos but leaving the GPS function on all day long seriously drains the battery. I am still not sure if the GPS function on the S100 will replace my GPS logger or not but I think that it might.A pleasant surprise that I noticed as soon as I started using the new camera is that operation feels substantially faster than it did with the S90. Focus seems more reliable and pretty much all of the functions on the camera feel more responsive. I am very pleased with the overall functionality of the S100.To avoid the dust and LCD damage that I had with the S90 I am carrying the S100 in a thin pouch that seems to be doing a good job protecting the screen and keeping dust away.The auto-focus on the S100 does seem to be a substantial improvement over the S90. With the S90 I would often have trouble getting the focus to lock when doing wide-angle landscape shots. With the S100 this rarely happens but it still does happen from time to time.On the image quality front I am not really sure what to think yet. The weather conditions weren't great for landscape photography for much of my trip but I think the image quality does seem to be pretty close to that of the old S90. In other words not bad but not great either. I think it will be acceptable for my needs (mostly web viewing and small prints no larger than 8x10).There does seem to be a lot of distortion at the widest setting which is a little bothersome. So far I have been shooting JPEG because I haven't been able to get RAW Therapee to work with the S100 RAW files yet. I do know that I was much happier with the S90 when I shot RAW and developed the files in RAW Therapee so I am holding off on final judgment when it comes to image quality.Overall I would say that I am rather happy with the S100 and I think it will be a nice fit for me and others in my situation.Some photos from my first trip with the camera are here:[...]", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Latest feedback - check the last review before buying", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R3OD51F7PO5KX8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There are many good reviews on this camera, no need to report what has been said.Just returned the S100 to Amazon today.

With family visiting, 55 pictures told me I made a mistake.  My camera was clearly one that produced unclear photos, some badly out of focus and many not sharp.  Having owned SLRs, I wanted an easy-to-carry, point and shoot, that worked well on \"auto\".  The S100 had all the features desired - large sensor, wide angle, high resolution - and it was disappointing when it performed poorly.  I do not plan to pick up another one (maybe an S95).

I returned it to Amazon and got the ELPH 50OHS.  The quality of the photos were better, but still not as sharp as I wanted them to be.This week I purchased the Canon PowerShot S100, and I LOVE it.Crystal clear photos, which is what I need.  Getting used to the functions, but I am a quick learner.The only thing that I like about the 500HS better than the S100 is the high speed burst function.  The 500HS will take as many photos as you hold down the shutter. The S100 will only take up to 8 photos at a time.That is not really a deal breaker considering the quality of the photos that I am getting with the S100.I have taken at least 5000 photos with the 500HS, and I could live with quality of the photos if there were no other options.The quality of the photos will always be the bigger factor.  I am sure that a small camera like a Leica could take better photos, but that is out of my budget.I don't want to carry a camera as big a DSLR anymore.  I carried my Canon F-1 every day for about 15 years, and I just got tired of carrying the camera, film, batteries, lenses, flash, etc.The Canon PowerShot S100 does almost everything that I want it to.

Monday I went to a local camera store and compared S95 vs S100 back to back including image quality on ISO 80 at 28mm & here is my impression: S95's image quality is noticeably superior, S100's image looks more washed out. S95's image is more consistent from center to corners but S100's image has 1 or 2 soft corners. At this focal point, S95's lens is brighter so has faster shutter speed. At ISO 800 both camera has pretty equal image quality but with such bright lens and good IS, you rarely shoot above 800 ISO. Unless you need the extra wide angle or slightly longer range I would choose S95 especially for the low price they offer. I do like the S100's better grip. I ended up taking the S95 home. I wanted to give 4 stars to the S100 but since it is 43% higher than the price of the S95 I give it a 3.Went home and compared S95 vs S90 back to back. Almost identical image quality except S95 has cleaner image processing at the darker areas due to an improve jpg processor. I also like the better ergonomics on the S95 and the price was $100 less than what I paid 1.5 year ago. Other notable improvement that was not mentioned in most reviews was there are more settings for Auto ISO: you can choose a slow ISO increase rate vs normal. In Program mode(P), the normal ISO increase rate was at 1/30\" shutter speed, but under slow ISO, the threshold is now 1/15\" which is very ideal for still or very slow moving objects in low light. This is just what I needed for the older S90 where under auto ISO setting, the camera wants to choose a much higher ISO than necessary thus produces poorer images, but now I just set it at slow auto ISO and let the camera choose the correct ISO.  I can also set a upper limit in addition to the auto ISO.

I was a bit skeptical about the quality of the images and do notice a different kind of image degrading when I blow up some images than I get with the Nikons, but for the type of shots I will use it for, a non-issue.  Yes, the battery runs down faster than others, so I have two. I like the function ring, am now used to the menu locations and can quickly adjust the flash, exposure and ISO for tricky lighting.

With that being said I have tried other major brand point and shoots but I always seem to come back to Canon. Professionally I shoot with the Canon 5D Mark II and 7D but I find that when I travel or shoot my kids I often just want something small and portable. Most recently I've used the G11 and G9 for that reason.One of the features I look for is a lot of manual control - while it's not necessary of course you can usually get the results that your eye sees if you understand how your camera sees and interprets light. If you're serious about photography I recommend taking the time to learn this - here's a perfect, easy to understand reference if you're interested: Understanding Exposure, 3rd Edition: How to Shoot Great Photographs with Any CameraThe advanced features such as manual controls and RAW exposures are the primary reason that this camera costs what it does. If you're not interested in any of that than you may not need this camera - the digital elph series may be a better bet for you. On the other hand if you want that level of control and size is the primary factor then this camera is perfect.Will you get the same results from a S100 that you would from a larger digital SLR? Simply put, no. You're always going to face issues with noise because of the smaller sensor size and you're always stuck with the same lens. Battery life is another issue - you'll want to pack some extras for a full day of shooting.While you're stuck with the built in lens it's a pretty decent quality one offering a nice wide 24mm view and a bright 2.0 aperture. It also features built in optical image stabilization which is valuable. The sensor in this camera is equivalent to the one used in the G11/G12 series (bigger than other similar sized point and shoots) which still gives you excellent image quality. Noise can be mitigated with some post-processing - Canon includes some nice software with this camera to get you started. One touch HD video recording is really convenient and with a 7 month old I find myself using that much more frequently than our video camera. What I like best is that I can stick this camera right in my jeans pocket. It's super small and very portable. When we're lugging the baby and his gear I'm grateful that this doesn't add any weight. And let's face it - while I prefer the way pictures look when I take them with my 5D Mark II, if the cameras not with me what's the point?Overall I'm very happy with this camera. I know there's some folks disappointed going from the S95 to this S100. If you have an S95 and you're happy you may not need to upgrade. If you're in the market for a new model I would say this is one of the best out there. I find myself taking it everywhere and finding new photo opportunities that I would have missed without it.

My review will compare some aspects of the S100 with my DSLR (a Nikon D90) which may be useful for others who are considering the addition of a small pocketable camera.I have used the S100 for a few days now and am generally very impressed with the quality of the images, and the level of customization possible.  The camera offers a myriad of functions for all levels of users, giving me a level of control that is fairly close to that I'm used to from my DSLR.  The lens is also excellent - far better than that of older point-and-shoot cameras (it rivals in sharpness [but doesn't quite reach] the quality of the kit lens that came with my DSLR).  The level of noise in the images and that of the the in-camera noise reduction algorithms, are very acceptable, and reach the level of quality that is provided by my 3-year old APS-C sensor DSLR. The biggest advantage of this camera for me is, of course, the tiny size of the camera, compared to the DSLR. While my other camera has a much better display, the screen of the S100 is just fine for normal use.  I also like the availability of an online luminance histogram (projected on top of the image). The construction of the camera is very good - it seems mechanically solidly built, with the only possible exception of the covers that hide the battery and USB/HDMI connectors.I don't particularly care for the many scene and automatic modes.  These are definitely for other types of users, and it is a strength of this camera that the modes can simply be ignored if one doesn't want to use them.  Having said this, though, the HQ burst mode, the multi-shot night mode and the HDR mode will probably be interesting to me in the future (I have tried them, and found them to work nicely).  Another big attraction for me is the possibility to use RAW images from this camera - custom-adjusted RAW images can be much better than the automatically generated JPG images.  While there have been negative comments about the inclusion of GPS capabilities in this camera, I find this feature very good, and, again, it can be disabled if one doesn't want to use it.Some aspects of my experience are not as positive.  Compared to the handling of the DSLR, the ergonomics of this camera are poor (as they are for most compact point-and-shoot cameras).  Many of the more interesting functions which have dedicated buttons on most DSLRs are only reachable through menus on the S100.  Also, focusing is a very slow process, compared to the much faster DSLR phase detect AF systems. Finally, the battery life is reportedly short, but I think that I will be able to live with this quite easily.  The battery is small, so that it should not be a problem to put an extra battery in one's pocket.  The software that is supplied with the camera is ok, but clearly not well integrated.  Canon could have done much better on this front, providing a solid piece of software rather than several that don't really integrate well with each other.  Unfortunately, I had problems installing the supplied suite of programs on one of my computers for reasons that are still not quite clear to me (it worked fine on another).I give this camera five stars despite the few negative points, because most of the camera issues (with the exception of the software issue) result from the fact that the camera is optimized to be small - the issues mentioned above are basically unavoidable.

It's everything I want in a compact camera.

I think the color temperature sensor is not as good as the G10 (I find I have to make more adjustments in Lightroom on the images from the S100 than I did before) but it's pretty darn good most of the time.

Either the reviewer is not using the camera properly, or, as this is such a new model, perhaps there are some defective ones.  Canon does have a warranty.The good news is that everything is improved:1. Ergonomics - slightly thinner so it fits in the pocket easier.  Textured finish, subtle front and rear grips.  The rear control dial has been perfected.  Just the right tension, comfortable detents.2. Eye Fi support - indicates when the card is active, and doesn't power off during transfers.3. GPS - Could be useful for location or accurate time-stamps, and easy to shut off it you don't like it.4. More wide angle, more telephoto - Not a lot of extra range, but for no extra space or trade off in lens quality, it's appreciated.5. Better high ISO - At least 1 stop better than the S90.  ISO1600 is noticeably more detailed and less noisy, with S100 NR at Low (which I recommend as a default setting).  This isn't the huge improvement I was hoping for after 2 years of sensor technology, but it is less noise and more megapixels than the S90.  I miss the \"amnesty international\" (candle logo) mode, but results are probably better than that mode by just using ISO6400 and brightening a stop or two afterwards.6. Movie Mode - If you had the S90, clearly you didn't care about video.  I don't, but it doesn't hurt to have it.  S100 video is great, high res and optical zoom.  Note that 6min at 720/30 will eat ~1GB.  1080 is 24fps, inconvenient for editing, but fine for grabbing frames out of that are high enough resolution to print 8x10 at 100dpi (plenty for the wall).  Somewhat makes up for the still anemic (2.3 fps) continuous shot mode (it is that slow even in M2, 2mp, mode).7. Better Image Stabilization - Not sure about vs the S95, but better compared to the S90.8. \"Other\" - Several other features to play with like HDR mode, Movie Digest, aspect ratios, ND filter, that may or may not be useful.  Macro is improved, but still inconvenient compared to other cameras.  The setting, like the S90, reverts to normal on power-off.  Unlike the S90, the S100 will not focus on distant objects in macro mode.Any other negatives would be in relation to other cameras than the S90 or S95.  There are now other cameras on the market like the Olympus XZ-1 or Fuji X10 that are worth considering for low-light pocket cameras, but both are much larger than the S100.  That's the cost of having a lens that is brighter at telephoto.  Sony may be faster at low light AF.

I see a lot of disappointed reviews in the S100 but I think it's more to do with the fact that there really isn't much of an upgrade from the S95 than lack of quality in the s100.  I have taken literally thousands of pictures with each camera, and they are both great.  I think the S95 takes certain pictures a bit better than the S100, but also the S100 takes certain pictures better than the S95.The S100 also has the separate video record button which is a nice feature, as well as the GPS feature.  The S100 has a slightly better zoom which is also nice.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 b/c i really was expecting it to be noticeably better than the S95 and it wasn't.  But its still a great camera and takes amazing pictures.edit:  I should add that i always use the camera in \"P-mode\".  Do not use on Auto mode, it's complete garbage.  I have no idea why Canon has this on the camera, it was horrible on the S95 and it's horrible on the S100, and it leads to most of the negative reviews on here when people don't know they shouldn't use it.Also, I almost always take pictures (of people) with the flash on.  The only time i don't is when they are facing into bright direct sunlight, or if for whatever reason the flash blows them out.  I would say for 90% of my people-pictures though I use the flash, even in daylight.  It just makes for a better picture, i couldn't explain why but go ahead and try it, you'll be surprised of the results.  If the flash is too bright, sometimes i'll back up a bit, zoom in, and try the same shot again.

Don't let the size fool you, it has just about all the features of an entry level DSLR and then some.

It has a ton of nifty modes that I don't use all too often seeing as how it will only give you a jpg version, but I have a fondness for the color select mode (which does work when shooting 1080p video).There are only a few things that I don't like about the camera. First is the battery life; it doesn't last that long. If you're getting this camera it means that you want a pocketable powerhouse or you have a lot of money for a point and shoot that you'll use rarely. If you're the former, make sure you pick up an extra batter or two. I can easily go through 2 a day and was relieved that I had a third so I wouldn't have to stop taking pictures. The second con is that you have to wait for your image to write to the SD card before you can take another. Make sure you pick up a class 10 card; you do NOT want that to be your bottleneck.I've been told that a lot of professional photographers use this as a backup and I can see why. This thing fits in your pocket and you can take it everywhere. The images you get are exceptional and it gives you all the flexibility you need to capture the image.

I bought this camera because it can record video in 1080p resolution (albeit at 24 fps). But then I discovered when I use it in a quiet room, I hear rattling sounds (woodpecker sounds) every time I move the camera around. After reading forums and experimenting myself, I concluded that this is because of the Auto Focus feature of this camera while in video recording mode. What you hear is really the mechanical things moving inside the camera body. So while this keeps the video stay sharp all the time because of the auto focus, you will hear the unpleasant rattling sound as well.To fix this, especially if you care more on the sound than the sharpness of the video, you might want to disable auto focus while in video. Here's how to do it:  - Set to \"P\" (Programs). You cannot use \"AUTO\" since the camera won't let you set manual focus.  - Aim camera to the desired object. Press shutter half-way to set focus automatically into this object.  - Press left button (on the four-way navigator) and select \"MF\". This will activate Manual Focus while shooting video. Note \"MF\" text should appear on the LCD.  - Press \"Video\" button (the red circle) to start video recording.Another tips is you may set the RING FUNCTION button to MF (manual focus). So all you need to do is to turn the ring once to enter Manual Focus just *before* you press \"Video\" button. Hope this helps! I do hope that Canon find a way to eliminate this rattling sound on their next generation camera, or make it so users can have MF as the default for video recording.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding point and shoot camera", "Author": "Douglas Y Park", "ReviewID": "R3I5WP06KTOHD3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So that you know where I am coming from, I am not an expert photographer, but a novice/intermediate.

When I turned it on again the LCD screen was black but all of the icons were functioning as normal. The camera acted as if it was fine, but upon review of photographs taken the first six were fine but anything taken after the LCD went black were blank.

I got the S100 for myself, as I was looking forward to the wider angle and reputedly cleaner high ISO (low light) performance.I think the image quality holds up well, which is saying a bit, since the new lens is much wider (24 vs 28) and a bit longer (120 vs 105).  I was also worried about going to a CMOS sensor, but the image quality is actually on par with the previous CCD.  When you go to higher ISO (1600 and above), the image quality is much nicer, in my opinion.  I do not use video much at all, so I cannot comment on video quality other than to repeat the newly improved specs.There are a few usability changes that I have to get used to.  They changed the button layout, and as a non-video user, the dedicated movie button is a waste for me.  I preferred not having to hit the up button before using the expousure compensations, which you now need to do.  The battery life seems a bit shorter (some report it getting better as the battery chip learns it capacity), and I wish it used the same battery as the S95.

I am really liking my camera so far so I have no reason to give it anything other than 5 stars.  I know my way around the manual settings of this camera, but I am far from a professional so I will hold off on a lengthy review.  The programmable control ring really makes the manual settings easily changeable.  Between the control ring and the sleek black color, its obvious you've got yourself something a little more substantial than a digital Elph.  This camera just does everything it is supposed to do very well.  The 5x zoom is inadequate for long distance shots, but that is not what this camera is for.  If you are interested in carrying a compact digital camera with all the major settings of your DSLR, this is a great option. I think this camera makes a great compact alternative and companion to a DSLR because it is easily pocketable and has great manual settings.  I recommend that you register your camera on Canon's website immediately because it guarantees you support and has provided me with this useful information that I would not have known otherwise.  I plan on updating this review.UPDATE #1In every way, I have found this camera to be a vast improvement over my previous compact digital camera, a 10.1MP Powershot ELPH SD88IS, however; it is not without issues.  Notably, the battery life is very poor when the default GPS mode is active.  I could not tell you exactly how many shots I have been able to get per charge, but it has been noticeably less than I would expect.  I already ordered a backup battery and am considering toggling the GPS as I need it.  This battery is the same basic battery that was in my 4-5 year old Elph.  I think it is time Canon looks at updating these NB5L batteries.  In addition, while the image quality for day shots is tremendous, I was not overly impressed shooting with a tripod at night.  I could not get more than a few half decent shots of a full moon for the life of me.  Despite my best efforts, I was having issues with exposure and focus.  I found underexposing and bracketing the focus to make for the best shots.  Reviewer  Sheraz A. Choudhary states \"NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHERS: a major con for me is that the s100 is locked to ISO80 for shutter speeds over 1sec. May not matter to most people but I loved shooting 15sec ISO400 shots with my s90.\"  This certainly did not help me either.  It was a real pain to see ISO80 keep flashing up as I slowed my shutter speed. If you are mainly concerned with shooting close range shots at night, you wont have a problem, but shooting stunning nighttime nature shots seems to be an issue.  Neither one of these issues is a real deal-breaker for me, but I have mentally subtracted a half star off this camera and well, I'd kind of like to get my hands on the Sony DSC-RX100.  Because it is almost $300 more expensive, I still feel good about my purchase of this camera.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "A pretty good enthusiast compact", "Author": "S. Vogt", "ReviewID": "R1J37TKDAUVBPV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying that my copy of this camera (just bought it last week @ Best Buy) does not appear to have any issues with its image quality. I'm not saying that I don't believe that there are some initial quality issues with this this camera. It's just that my camera seems to work fine in that regard.That said... at lower ISOs, I really don't see a monumental difference in RAW or JPEG between it and the S95. At ISO400 and above however...there is noticeably less noise in the S100 pics. I wouldn't go as far as to say that ISO1600 is completely noise free on the S100 but it does deliver a much cleaner picture than the S95 did. Detail capture is about the same between the two cameras. Which is to say, pretty darn good. One thing I have noticed though is that the default colors are a little flatter on the S100 vs. the S95. But this is not necessarily a bad thing. It allows you a little more room to adjust it as you see fit.The camera feels about the same as its predecessors. Very solid build and well constructed. You have a thumb rest on the back of the camera and a tiny indent in the front for gripping. So the camera is very comfortable to shoot with. It also has an extended 5x zoom range.Like it predecssors, one of the hallmarks of the S100 is the rotating ring on the front which you can customize to adjust almost any function you want in the camera. I cannot overemphasize how useful this feature is. My preference is customize to adjust shutter speed but you can also use it adjust ISO and aperture.You have two menus on the camera, the regular menu and then the function menu. The function menu contains the most-accessed shooting settings (ISO adjustment, changing from JPEG to RAW). While the rest of the settings are under the regular menu.Shooting performance is a mixed bag. Shot-to-shot times have improved on the S100 and it is quicker to start up. However, autofocus performance has not improved over the S95. It's acceptable, but, it's disappointing to see that Canon has not improved this aspect of performance over its predecessor.The video is excellent for a compact camera. Generally very clean and excellent audio. It wouldn't take the place of a camcorder. But it's a great choice if you want a camera that shoots quick videos of decent quality.The S100 is very good camera but I don't think in some respects it's a very compelling upgrade from the S95. It's picture quality at lower ISOs is virtually the same and its shooting performance hasn't made big enough of a leap. So if you primarily shoot stills at lower ISOs and don't do a lot of night shooting, you really aren't gaining much by upgrading. But if you shoot a lot in low light, want the extra zoom, and/or are new to the S series from Canon.

I think that even at base ISO, the S100's detail rendition is as good as that of my G10 (which is almost as good as the excellent 50D DSLR). In that regard, it's wonderful, capable of taking images which very few could tell were taken by a small sensor camera.Performance at higher ISOs is also surprisingly good, far surpassing that of the G10. Up to ISO 400, image noise is no problem unless one wants to make a moderately large print, 12X18 inches or more. Even then (at 400) a modest touch of noise reduction preserves all the detail while eliminating visible noise. At ISO 1000 or 1250, very good images are obtainable, when noise reduction is applied. At 1600 and above, color rendition drops off and noise becomes a problem for anything more than small web displays.There have been a few mild criticisms of the ergonomics of the S100, but I think those criticisms are probably the result of people trying to use it for an hour or so and finding the interface slightly different. After using the camera for a day or two, one almost never needs to access the menus. Aperture, shutter speed, ISO, white balance, and exposure comensation can be set so they're \"right out in the open\" for the photographer who needs to change something quickly during a shoot. Even with my XL size hands, using the camera is easy and comfortable.For me, the S100 is not really a \"shirt pocket compact\", and it's only a \"trousers pocket compact\" if the trousers are pretty large, with roomy pockets. But it is small, and it rides comfortably in a small Sony camera case, looped onto my belt.The S100's limitations probably would not be noticed by a casual family photographer. Focus is not as rapid as it is with a DSLR. Shutter lag is noticeable, even with pre-focus. Dynamic range isn't as broad as that of a large sensor camera. These are limitations common to almost all small sensor cameras.Finally, there's no \"hot shoe\" which could accomodate an external flash unit, and the camera's small built-in flash is of very limited use. The workaround is to use an external flash as a slave unit, but that does complicate things a little.There is no perfect camera,but for a small, very portable camera, it's almost impossible to beat the S100.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buyer beware!", "Author": "Mary C", "ReviewID": "R1OZOSMACB4IRS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have recently purchased 2 Canon S100 cameras after reading great reviews.

I have taken it on two vacations, and have used it for a variety of other occasions. I love the video feature that takes 5 second clips with each picture, it is great for things like helicopter rides through the grand canyon, where you would like both pictures and some video.So far I have been very pleased with the photos taken by this camera, I haven't notice any of the defects that some others have reported. The outdoor photos I have taken are stunning, very crisp and the colors are true to life. The low light and indoor pictures are also very good for a compact.The biggest disappointing I have had with this camera is the gps system. It doesn't record location data (apparently unable to find satellites) for over half my pictures, even ones that were taken in roughly the same area. There is also apparently no way to permanently load pictures into the map software that it came with to record different vacations and such, you must reload the picture each time you open the software.Overall, this is a great camera, I would recommend it to more serious photographers who either don't want to buy or to carry around a dslr. The advanced settings may be confusing for some, but the auto setting is very good, so most will never need the extra settings. I have not had a great experience with the gps function, but I really don't need it. I wanted a great compact camera, and this one was exactly what I was looking for.

Canon can repair them and will free-of-charge.  But why put the consumer through that hoop. They should have all been recalled; they do it for automobiles, so why not cameras, etc.?? And, I can't think of a single reason why Amazon check the serial numbers before selling to guarantee delivering a working product and perserving their reputation.For reference, see other one and two star reviews of this camera...UPDATE:  Replacement camera arrives. Serial # is 47xxx and works fine so far.  This would be a five star product if it weren't for the production run error that was not corrected by recall.

I find almost no difference in IQ between my SX230 and S100, both are CMOS based HS systems.Also, there seems to be highlight clipping when using the flash and skin tones look off color. Canon did improve the build quality, since the S95 had loose LCD cover panels, but the S100 has this very nasty rough texture and plastic feel. They copied the rubber hand strip on the Nikon P300. The zoom range is longer and video is better, but nothing forgives the diminished IQ in this new model, especially at this price range. Pictures in daylight are ok, but do not stand out from the rest of their HS line. It seems they focused on high ISO shooting, but sacrificed overall IQ.

I considered the Sony RX100 and this camera, the  newest pocket cameras with larger image sensors.  I chose the s100 since:-RX100 didn't really have a long term track record as it was only recently released.-Smaller size and weight of the S100, excellent image quality given its size.-Much lower cost of the S100-Lens error due to heat/humidity had been fixed in later production batches according to a recall bulletin by Canon; the camera's serial number began with 46 and was not a part of the recall-Other than the above lens error issue the camera had a good reliability record from several forumsThe bad is that I got the lens error where the lens gets stuck in the out position and fails to retract after extending and retracting while on vacation in Japan.  I'd taken a few pictures here and there, put it back in my camera bag or pocket, repeat several times for an hour or two.  After a dozen tries, the lens finally retracted but then failed to extend.Luckily, there was a Canon service center less than 20 minutes away from my hotel by foot and subway.  Long story short, since I didn't have my warranty card or proof of purchase with me on my trip other than from my Amazon account which I offered to bring up given Wifi access, they \"offered\" to repair it for just under 11,000 yen.  After pointing out that I'd  be returning home to the United States before the repair completion date, they responded that I could either come back and pick it up or I could arrange to have it delivered to me (what I understand is a polite way of saying owner pays delivery cost).  So let me get this straight, a camera designed and built in Japan that I bought less than a month ago fails in Japan under normal use and I would have to pay to get it repaired?  I would have purchased a new camera at a local electronics store, except that all the labels/menus were in Japanese and the only one I could figure out how to use at the store was a Canon S100.After a few days of occasionally turning the camera on and off, the camera suddenly started working again for whatever reason and the lens extended.  Unfortunately that particular time was while sitting in a stairwell while holding it wrong and the camera slipped from my hands and tumbled down a flight of concrete and steel stairs with the lens extended.  Other than scratches and dents on the body and the lens barrel, the camera took great quality shots and worked as good as new the rest of the trip.Summing up the bad experiences with the camera:-Lens error apparently not fixed-Bad service experience overseas-Should have bought an extra battery for the trip, video and GPS seem to suck up a considerable amount of battery life-HDR mode useless without a tripodI knew the technical limitations of this camera and also that batches with the lens error fix did not have an extended track record and went with this camera anyways.  I took a bet on this camera and lost (at least a few days).  In any case this camera is now working fine as far as I can tell.12/18/2013 update:Took it on a 2 week vacation, hit a lens error once when zooming and the camera shut down (retracted the lens though).

Over all it is a great little camera, but it is not a replacement for a DSLR.  I do a lot of stuff in the mountains of Colorado.  I just returned from a back country ski trip into a hut system.  The photos that this camera made were quite good.  It performed quite well at very cold temperatures.  The lens is very sharp.  Over all I gave it 5 stars but actually I almost gave it 4 because because time exposures over one second are limited to iso 100.  This time exposure issue would not be a problem for most people, it's just that I like to take pictures to the night sky from high altitude, but for this my DSLR is better anyway.  Never the less it still does 15 second exposures at iso 100 which would be great for photos of things like city lights at night, etc.Pros:  Excellent picture quality, Best image stabilization I have ever seen, very small, buttons and controls are easy to figure out and not so easy to change by accident, the camera has some interesting special effects and shooting modes but for me, I do all that in Photoshop, I like the automatic lens cover, and the flash is quite powerful for it's size, you can turn the GPS off completely to save battery life, the burst mode is amazing for action shots, it seems quite solid with a case made of metal, it has an easy to grip texture which will help prevent its being dropped.Cons:  Battery life is relatively short (I got 4 extra original Canon batteries used on Amazon for less than $25), the GPS doesn't seem to be accurate all the time, there is the issue of time exposures limited to iso 100, you can't add an external flash but the built in flash is actually quite good.This camera has a nice relatively wide angle lens.

Still the camera has been a nightmare for me. I require reliability. This has not been the case.I have had this camera for a year and a half. I wanted to have a pocket-size all-purpose camera for shooting kids and to use while skiing. I am a photographer and always like to have a camera with me. Cell phones are useful but in general won't do if you want good quality and to make larger prints. This camera takes great shots. It focuses fast and accurately and handles most scenes quite well.I use the program or scene modes frequently and find that I only use manual mode rarely. The images from this camera will not hold up to close inspection with larger sensor cameras but will give you good shots in most situations. Color saturation and dynamic range as well as detail will not be as good as C size or full frame sensors. That doesn't mean that you won't get acceptable pictures depending on your purpose.The problems that I've had with this camera have been significant to me. The first is that this battery cannot stand up to exposure to cold weather for even a brief period. You may get one or two Shots off when taking pictures on a mountain while skiing or even 15 seconds of video but no more. The red battery light comes on telling you that you need to change your battery and this even though the battery is fully charged. I returned my camera to Canon who told me nothing was wrong and that the camera was up to spec. This camera is not guaranteed to take pictures at temperatures below 32\u00b0. All my previous PowerShot cameras have been fine under the circumstances in fact I have never had a problem before. I Returned my camera a second time when this continued to happen this year and they change the motherboard. The camera is a little better but it's clear that the problem relates to this particular battery. The battery has been changed For the S110 which is back to the battery used in the S95. Interestingly my wife has the S95 and that is the camera that we used this season for our ski pictures without a problem.The camera makes beautiful videos in high definition of indoor sporting events with the only problem being again the battery not lasting that long. If you shoot in slow motion your images are also likely to be somewhat dark unless you are in a very bright arena.To Make a long story short, this is an excellent camera particularly at this price point. It gives beautiful pictures, beautiful videos and has state-of-the-art functionality for a point-and-shoot camera.If you plan on just going out and shooting a couple of snapshots, the battery will do fine. If you're going to use this to shoot events make sure you buy an extra battery. If you plan on using this outdoors in cold weather buy something else.ps. Canon Service was actually quite good.

I'd planned to use the camera on multi-day wilderness trips, but this would require toting along several extra batteries (at $30 - $60 each!)  Also, the image quality is not what I would have expected from a $429 camera. On my unit, colors often seem dull, and the focus is uneven with distinct blurring occurring consistently in the lower right corner of images (this is particularly visible in flat, highly detailed photos shot from a parallel plane, such as lawn from about five feet overhead). And even at low ISO settings, resolution seemed no better than my three-year-old Sony DSC-W80 pocket camera. (I did check the lens for smudges or fogging, found none, but meticulously cleaned it anyway.  No improvement. Also tried a variety of settings and lighting conditions.)  The S100 does have some impressive qualities: HD video is very good, GPS works well (though I wish there were an option to choose between UTM and Lat-Lon coordinates in the display . . . and on-board mapping software would be VERY nice!), and the camera boots up really fast. It is also loaded with potentially great features (I particularly liked the function-selectable lens ring).

Closest I could find before this little beauty was the G series which is in no way a lightweight quick little camera like this. Beyond that the ability to take video was of secondary importance. The ability to use zoom on this one and record in 1080p was really icing on the cake. Finally, the 24mm f/2.0 is fabulous. Oh and with the toggles you can control the f stop easily as well in Manual. The Raw plus jpeg mode is key as well.Frankly for me, the ability to toggle the features and use the front dial to change settings on the fly makes this rig user friendly and highly flexible and adjustable.

I have used 28mm (field of view) equivalents for quite a while now and a recent experience with a 35mm equivalent camera reminded me why. It left me wondering how people get by with such constricted fields of view - hardly anything could fit in the frame. This 24mm wide angle has opened a whole 'nother point of view! Going from a 28mm POV to 24mm is as big a step as going from 35mm to 28mm.My retired Canon SD870IS is a marvelous little wonder that was my foray back into the world of fully automatic cameras. It has served extremely well and with almost enough adjustments to do everything required of it. It is now severely battered, has a huge grey splotch on the lcd screen (known problem) but still produces excellent results. I've always looked at the S95 and thought longingly, 'If only it had a 24mm like the Panasonic LX5.' Conversely I looked at the LX5 and thought, 'If only it had HDR and was as compact as the S95.' That way I could safely justify staying away from either. Well, with the S100 Canon called my bluff!From very limited use, impressions are as follows:This camera blows the 870IS out of the water in terms of responsiveness.Every time I power up and look into the screen it is like ,'Whoa, that is a dramatic view!' That's 24mm for you..In auto mode you will almost never run out of light for a decent flash-less shot.In video mode, the 870IS would blur out when zooming in on a subject. The S100 refreshingly retains autofocus.The various scene modes are fun to play with.Cons:My hunch is that the S100 does not produce quite as vivid results as the SD870 when left to its own devices. May need to play around with it more.I preferred to take pics on my SD870 at 3MP resolution. With the S100 its either 2MP or 6MP+The zooming action is super-fast, which is not such a great thing in video mode when you want a more gradual zoom.That Canon added a 24mm to this camera is insane. It is worth ten times the paltry increase in MSRP over the S95. C'mon people, you know how exponentially valuable a wider field of view is!

After using mine for two days I can tell you that it ain't so.  It is capable of taking some lovely pictures, with pleasing flesh tones and perfectly balanced lighting.  But it can take some stinkers too--out of focus, yellow and overexposed (with flash and incandescent lighting).  At times in an indoor setting the screen blurred annoyingly and there was a shutter delay of about 3-4 seconds, by which time the moment had passed.  I love the special effects, like fisheye lens and color accent.  A good camera for some but not all situations, although if you're a very knowledgable photographer and have taken the time to get familiar with all the settings then you'll probably have better results.  Is it worth the money?  Maybe, but not for me.I also have to agree with the complaints about battery life.  After taking about 80 photos, most with flash, and 5 short videos of 5-30 seconds my battery was pretty much depleted.  (Canon says camera should take about 200 photos per charge.)  Video quality is generally ok, but I'll definitely stick with my Sony camcorder when I want HD video.Update:  After playing with a Canon SX230HS I decided to keep the S100.  It has a very solid, comfortable feel--compared to the SX230HS--and I'm getting more comfortable with the various menus and settings.  For example, I can now quickly alter the white balance (which you would expect auto white balance mode to do, but it doesn't) and I've learned to use Program mode or Aperature priority mode in most situations.  I've already mentioned that I love the in-camera special effects, and the slow-mo video too. Finally, compared to cameras I've had in the past there is remarkably little noise at high ISO settings.

I received a camera in the 46XX for serial number with a 1.01 firmware version. I did an upgrade to the latest firmware 1.02 even without having any problems that the firmware is meant to fix. I noticed with the new firmware the Auto mode is much more responsive and produces better color and overall picture quality.  I also prefer to use P or M modes to get much sharper pictures in general than those from the Auto setting which has the tendency to prefer high ISO thus adding noise to the IQ.

I have more experiences with Nikon and found most of the time the pictures from their cameras have the tendency to be \"warmer\" than those from Canon but with the S100 I can \"enhance\" the picture to look more \"punchy\" by cranking up Sharpness, Saturation, Contrast or RGB depending on the situation (this is really just personal taste and the Canon S100 does produce very accurate color by default but you need to play with it to find your best preferred combination - also note that Auto mode does not allow you to change Custom Color nor set E/V). I would have given this camera a 4.5 star if it is allowed since I don't believe it is perfect but for its class it deserves a good 5.0 star (compared to others I have tested that are much more expensive e.g Olympus zx-1, Panasonic LX7, Nikon P770Canon PowerShot S100 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)0 etc..). I would highly recommend this camera as a permanent travel companion since it is the smallest pocket camera there is around capable of taking incredible images, even in low light.

But how do you improve on perfect?Long story short, you can't.The S100 features a slightly bulkier, boxier chassis in comparison to the S95, which for some people is a welcome change, due to the easier grip, though others still prefer the sleek feel of the S95; the new look is too much of a change and will really depend on whether or not you came from the S95, or are now just entering the realm of Canon's S-series.For someone who already owns the S95, the S100 is not worth springing for. Newer is not necessarily better (as seen so profusely with Panasonic's sad upgraded lines of their GF series.. the GF-1 remains by far the best out of all their updates to that line, surpassed only once they came out with the GX series). In actuality, the S100 is what I would call a side-grade. It's the alternative reality of the S95, and with this, I have to say - if you've never handled the S95, you would probably enjoy the S100. It doesn't do anything much worse than the S95, but it's not much better than the S95 is either.For me, I have handled both and in all honesty, they both perform admirably well. But don't think that the S100 is supposed to outclass the S95.

Google \"canon s100 lens error serial number\" to see Canon's acknowledgement of the lens error problem.I did enable the GPS feature (but not the GPS logger) and my fully charged battery died overnight.  I will repeat this experiment and update this review.  The GPS tagging feature was one of the biggest selling points for me and I really don't want to worry about having to remember to turn this feature on and off.Initial impressions: The camera is very solidly built, the controls knobs are deeply knurled (making them easy to turn) and have very solid detents.  I find that the feature ring on around the lens makes it somewhat difficult to slip the camera into my pocket.  It is about 3/16\" higher than the surrounding camera body.  The lens cover is flush with the top of the feature ring, my guess is Canon wanted to keep the body as thin as possible but needed a little more depth to fit the lens assembly.  The first time that the flash popped up, my finger was pushed out of the way.  My previous camera had a fixed flash, not a pop up style.  I've since adjusted my grip on the camera to keep my left index finger behind the flash pop up area. The camera body above the top left corner of the LCD screen is not smooth and rounded, rather it has a small \"step\" which makes it a good gripping point.  The camera body has a textured paint finish (almost like fine sandpaper) that also helps in gripping the camera.  I wish the top dial and exposure button positions were swapped, I think this would make one-handed shooting a little more stable and secure.  The way these controls are positioned now, the camera seems to rotate slightly when pressing down on the exposure button.  If these controls were swapped, your right hand could more move under the camera and pressing the exposure button would oppose your hand versus create a rotational force.  Again, these are my initial impressions, I will update this review after I have a chance to get to know my S100 better.

This review won't cover all the features this camera has, but from my limited experience with it so far, I can say it takes very clear pictures and boots up extremely fast. It's ready to start shooting within 1 or 2 seconds of powering on - which is exponentially faster than my old cybershot. Whats different (and something I like) about the S100 is the adjustable ring around the lens. It can act as the zoom in \"auto\" mode or it can even change the f-stop in manual modes.It's priced higher than many other digital point and shoots, but if you consider the quality of pictures you geta and the the features, its a really good value. Dont get sucked in by the 15+ MP cameras because if you're not printing photos to fit on the side of a building, you don't need anything that big!One thing that also made my purchase that much  more satisfying is how fast it was delivered to my house!

I did a lot of research on small cameras and decided on the Canon S100 because it got very good reviews for the following: low-light shots, fast recycle time, image stabilization, manual controls, and others.  One big criteria for me was that it had to fit in my pocket.  I have been more than pleased with the results from this camera.  We were in several churches in Italy where the lighting was somewhat dark.  The S100 took excellent pictures, without flash, under those circumstances.  We were on the go constantly, I took many shots while I was walking, or on a boat, or on a bus.  The image stabilization works great!  I kept this camera in my pants pocket all the time.  I could pull it out of my pocket, turn it on, and begin shooting right away.  No real time lag, no waiting for it to boot up.  Also, no time lag between being able to take the next shot.  The quality of all of the photos I have taken with this camera have been excellent.  Because we were on the go in Italy, I kept it on auto the whole time.  Since then, I have had opportunity to use some of the manual settings and I am really impressed at the amount of control the user has over all of the settings.  Not as many settings as a DSLR, but enough to take some really good shots.  Overall, I would highly recommend this camera as a great point-and-shoot that takes great photos and will easily fit in your pocket.By the way, the S100 fits very nicely in the following case:  Case Logic TBC-302 Compact Camera Case (about $5).

Discuss that later.  The camera start up is fast seem to be faster than s95. Focus shot to shot is also improvement but could had been better.  In s95 i can't use iso more than 400 it cause too much noise, but with s100 i can use iso 1600 still pretty good, pcmag said s100 can use up to iso 2000. Which I can is probably true. Is best in class for the iso test.  Video is excellent. Soem of the video in outdoor can match quality of those mirror less camera with their kit lens. S100 can beat mirror less camera in low light with their kit lens, is not fair comparison, but most people buy mirror less don't want to buy pancake since cost as much as this camera. The gps function is good but canon picture software doesn't do geotag automatic for you, just gave u the gps info is up to to use it, upload to site like flixr or picasa instead. S100 has better grip support than s95.  the silver color of s100 really stand out better than black one, the battery in the s100 is made in japan, s95 battery is made in china.The issue with this camera is the shuttle lag freeze at some of the shots, usually during hot weather like 90 degree after you take like 50 shots in 30 minutes time frame, the camera will sometime freeze for few seconds before you can take another shots, is annoying i do not expect such issue with s95, the sensor or chip in s100 is hotter than s95, cause i do felt the camera is warmer after some use.Another annoying problem is the video focus usually during low light, u can easily hear the focus noise . Not too loud but is noticible, is the only p&s; with this sensor has this problem, other camera has to be like m4/3 sensor or larger to hear such noise.  the auto iso in long expose is limited to 80 only, not usefull. Typical auto iso only goes up to 1600. the HDR and night handle mode is useless without tripod. sony camera hdr can use it without tripod as well as night handle mode.  How can canon call hand handle mode if you still need tripod. Also no panorama mode, canon is the only major camera brand doesn't offer that feature only assist you mode.  You must buy spare battery for this camera, just get the after market one only like $15 or less, you might need 2-3 if you gonna shoot more than 400 photos without charging.

Reasonable price.", "Author": "Shelly", "ReviewID": "R2E3U43NGL581G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:  Small (but not tiny); typically straightforward Canon controls; easy to adjust; a multitude of available settings; high quality photos for a point-and-shoot.  Flexible options from auto to full manual.  Low-light capability better than smaller point-and-shoots.  Good manual (electronic, not paper).  Plenty of inexpensive cases available.Cons:  Low-light capability not up to hype (but no camera is up to its introductory hype).Neutral:  Reliable since purchase on Black Friday 2012.  Shutter priority seems always slightly underexposed (which frequently isn't a bad thing).  A pocket camera only if you have large pockets and are willing to expose an expensive (for point-and-shoot) camera to pocket lint and whatever else you carry.  Until recently, the S100 was reputedly the pro's point-and-shoot sidekick because of its easy portability, larger (for a point-and-shoot) sensor and ability to shoot in full manual mode.  The Sony RX100, at three times the price, appears to have replaced the Canon S100 as the top-of-the-line point-and-shoot.Comment:  Don't believe the breathless hype about any new electronic device, and consider exactly what you need and what you will use.  Many people over-buy, believing the latest thing will solve all their problems.  They fool themselves into thinking they'll spend the time digesting the manual and learning the camera's complex controls.  But they quickly find their cameras are too heavy and complicated for their day-to-day use.  More people are frustrated with the complexity of their camera than feel strangled by its limitations.  If you rarely change your present camera's settings from auto, and don't relish reading technical manuals, stick with a $100 point-and-shoot.  If you'd like something with greater flexibility that won't break the bank, and you're willing to spend time with the manual to realize the benefits of a sophisticated camera, the Canon S100 is a very good choice.  It will do far more than most amateurs ever need.

So it feels uncomfortable in my hands.  I guess my other \"pocket cameras\", a SONY and a Nikon had quite different grips and I'll have to adjust.

Watch out for the case they will try to sell you.  i will write a review for that.I had an intial problem figuring out the software.  Simply,how to upload the pictures to the computer. I had to call Canon about problems with uploading pictures from my SLR and he helped me with the Powershot because i was so confused.  Don't let that stop you though.  It might have been me and if it wasn't, Canon tech support is great.The camera was recommended to me by another photographer in the UK  who wishes he still had his..  He said it was the best pocket camera he ever had.  He's a great photographer and we shoot and post together on the same international site, so I trusted his judgement.Bottom line is, so far, so good.  I really like the quality of the photographs I've taken to date.  Not much glare where I might have expected to get some.  Crisp color.  Sharp images.  All basically on auto.

This camera is convenient in many ways.  It is easy to carry around because of its small size, height and width are very similar to an I-phone but thickness is a bit bigger, and the weight is negligible when it is in my pocket.  I have the black matte finish and the texture, very similar to very fine grit sandpaper, makes it feel secure in my hand.  There is no feeling of it slipping out of my hand.  It is also very easy to use as both a camera and video recorder, and images from both settings come out looking very crisp and clean.  Although if you move the camera around quickly in the video mode it will be blurry.  The functions, at least the ones I use, are easy to understand just from fiddling with the camera and the others are clear after going through the manual or looking at a couple of videos on you tube.I have not used it for an extensive time period so I have not had any issues with the battery life, but I also do not use the GPS function and turn off most of the others.  So if you are into using all the functions available you may want to look into purchasing a second battery.The one issue I do have with the camera is the same one that many people do too.  It is the positioning of the flash.  Imagine holding a camera, for most people the left index finger rests on the top/left portion of the camera and this is exactly where the flash pops up from.  However, most of the cameras that I reviewed before purchasing this one seem to have the flash set up in exactly the same way.  I have found that when you ask someone to take a photo of you, make sure the flash is open before you hand them the camera.Why by this camera for $300 when there are similar specs for about $100. I found this camera to be lighter than the $100 counterparts and the quality of photos, both on my computer and after they are developed, to be of a higher quality.  My previous cameras were a Nikon and Sony, both bought around $120, took forever to shoot between pictures.  I would push down the button and it would take about 6 seconds for the photo to take and then another 3 before I could take another picture.  For me this was a big issue when I was taking pictures of my kids and nieces and nephews because I would miss the shot I wanted of them because it took so long for the cameras to actually capture the image( little kids move around ALOT!).

There are a lot of grey market Canon batteries out there in genuine Canon packaging, but when you get them, most of the printing on the battery is in Chinese, not English, and the Chinese batteries hold much less of a charge than the \"real\" batteries. I got one of these through a 3rd-party Amazon affiliate and the product description said nothing of this other than it was a genuine Canon battery-- very misleading product description which I've brought to Amazon's attention, but nothing has been done about it so far.The second part is not so sweet. The camera I purchased was sold by Amazon and shipped my Amazon. The first camera came with so little packing in the box that they might as well have put no packaging in the box.

When I got the replacement camera, it was packed exactly the same way as the first camera.

I can't afford to do my own exhaustive testing on the camera to ensure that it is not damaged (the first camera took 2 weeks before I heard a grinding sound from the lens).I am normally a strong supporter of Amazon who has been buying from them for at least 15 years, but I am very annoyed and frustrated at the way they have (or have not) handled this problem and they refuse to escalate the problem beyond the first level supervisor in the order/customer support center. I have now burned through more than $900 worth of cameras that I am returning to them, and they can't sell these as new, so they have to be eating the cost. In fact, the supervisor refused to send out another camera to me because \"it is likely to have the same packaging issue\". Okay, they won't send any more to me, but if someone else purchases this camera, they will have the same packaging issues as I had.  I can't believe that Amazon considers this to be an acceptable business model! It's also a rare instance where they are not focused on customer satisfaction.

But, I could address this by half-pressing the shutter button and letting the camera determine the focus, lighting, etc. Then, when the shot was ready, I could quickly snap the composed pic.

The Sony RX100 is the hands down favorite for image quality (it's got 20MP in an even bigger sensor) but the S100 is smaller and the built-in GPS is a nice feature. With 12MP, the S100 is has plenty of resolution and it's probably the best on-the-go compact.  The RX100 beats it in the image quality department, but it's also slightly bigger, heavier and slower to use.For comparison, I took some landscape shots using the Canon S100, Sony RX100, Sony NEX-7, Canon 5DIII and Nikon D800.The Nikon D800 and Canon 5DIII were the best and readily distinguishable. However, the rest were all so good that I had to keep checking to see which camera took the shot. These were a combination of day and sunset shots in Colorado with a lot of detail and contrast.

So, it seemed like a no-brainer to upgrade to the S100. The S90 was a fabulous pick for is because it takes great, fast photos in low-light on automatic mode, but still has lots of custom settings for my husband who likes to play around with settings and experiment with different kinds of exposures, etc.So we bought this camera primarily to continue to photograph our day-to-day adventures with our active 3 year old, and hopefully in a few months, her new sibling. However, the performance has been dramatically slower. In auto-mode, it takes a good 1-3 seconds to focus (pressing the shutter halfway) and yet another 1-3 seconds after that to actually SNAP the photo. Completely unacceptable when you have moving subjects like a toddler. By the time the shutter goes, the subject has already moved and the results are many blurry shots. We never had this experience with the S90, or friends/families with the S95.  We ensured that settings which might slow things down (such as red-eye reduciton) were turned off, and after a few months, the frustration was just too much and we are trying to return it.Canon refuses to provide a refund since we didn't purchase it through them, but Amazon appears to be willing to take it back.

It fits in your pocket, in a small compartment in your backpack, and in any other multitude of convenient places.  And as the sayings go, the camera you carry is the one you will use.  What's really nice about this camera's size is that you can use it instead of your smartphone...it takes up little extra space and it takes phenomenal pictures.The camera also has significantly more features than a typical point-and-shoot-camera.  You can set virtually any aspect of the camera manually.  The screen is really nice (rich, bright and sizable), although it would be nice if it could swivel.  The picture quality is good, as is the video quality.  The camera feels like a high quality piece.So what's wrong with the camera, and what is the \"fatal flaw?\"1.  There is no viewfinder - yes, that's typical today for a point-and-shoot, but disappointing in an enthusiast-grade camera.2.  The flash is horrible and there is no hotshoe for an external flash.  Again, fairly typical for a point-and-shoot, but disappointing in an enthusiast's camera.3.  Battery consumption is unbelievably high....it feels like the camera has a parasite in it....Using the GPS feature will really hurt battery performance.

The body is like brand-new.  But none of that mattered the other night when I visited the Boston Red Sox the other night and the camera froze up with the well-publicized lens error.  That took the camera out of commission and I had to send it back for evaluation and repair.  This is a disappointing development and really causes me to distrust the camera.  If you do a search on the web for \"Canon S100 Lens error\", you'll see it's a wide-spread problem.Why won't Canon recall these cameras?  Why can't they simply build them right so this problem doesn't happen?

In post I threw in all the RAW files together, did quick adjustments in Lightroom, and exported them together. I was unable to distinguish many of my shots between the two cameras. The only way I could tell was my proximity to the subject, but sharpness and colors came out almost indistinguishable. I will say that the S100 tends to blow out whites in some scenarios. It's battery dies very fast, especially with video...Video is 1080p, 24fps. You can set your own white balance, focal length, and manually lock in focus on a subject PRIOR to hitting REC. Once you do the camera shifts to AUTO ISO, so I find it best to set its WB, keep auto-focus, and let it do the rest. The front facing stereo mics are amazing for the size of that camera. The image-stabilization was very welcome (coming from a DSLR).The biggest positives are that image and video quality are good enough, in comparison to a DSLR. There are plenty of full manual controls for stills (which don't carry over for video). The battery sucks (buy extras). I can live with these limitations because it fits in my coat pocket, or jeans back pocket. It gives me great stills and video, in a small, discreet package. So now I always a great camera on me. I used to stick to my iPhone for casual stills but battery and internal storage get chewed up like crazy. The best camera is the one that you have on you, unless the camera app crashes on you every now and again, iTunes Match eats up storage, and video recording causes the unit to shut off.

Still happy with the Pentax, but the Panasonic's CCD turned out to be be a dust magnet, so after carefully comparing point-and-shoots with manual capabilities, I bought a refurbished S100.It felt good to return to Canon's practice of having the \"no flash\" setting on the five-way switch on the camera back rather than Panasonic's placement on the mode-selection dial.  Since I never, ever, want flash, Canon's way of doing things allows me to use all possible modes without ever having to experience unwanted flash.  All of the other things on which other reviewers have commented - sharp lens, easy-to use ring around the lens for certain key settings, bright LCD - make the camera enjoyable, and it travels with me wherever I got.But (and there is always a but) either my S100 is a battery eater, or the OEM 1120 mAh battery supplied with the camera is junk, because I ran completely through the fully-charged battery after taking a grand total of 33 shots (56.7MB of information recorded).  I've ordered some Wasabi batteries from Amazon (Wasabi Power Battery Charger PowerShot Wasabis performed better than the OEM batteries in my Panasonic) and we'll see if the problem is the battery or perhaps a short somewhere in the camera which is draining batteries prematurely.  This could be why the camera was returned for refurbishment, although generally I have had great luck with refurbished photographic products.  I note that a few other reviewers mention short battery life, but my sense is that they are talking about a dead battery after a day of shooting maybe 100 pictures, not 33 shots over a two-week period.Edit 10/27 - I recharged the battery and have just done about 60 more shots over a two-day period and the battery is still showing full.  My takeaway from this is that the battery will slowly drain if the camera is left unused, which may be why Canon tells you to \"Remove and store the battery when you are not using the camera.\"  BTW, I also compared the S100 and my DSLR with a Sigma 18-200mm zoom by enlarging portions of shots taken at the same time from the same location, and the S100 is way sharper.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Happy Camper", "ReviewID": "RLWFNXLQRBTCU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Perfect videos, great shots, point and shoot perfect, using the program settings perfect.

This is a great substitute for a DSLR when you want something much more portable and for a lower price. The black color is stylish. I was most impressed by the wide-angle lens, video shooting quality, and low-light images. I rarely need the flash! This feature helps images stay true to color. This is also the first Canon camera I have had that has a battery indicator on it - it used to be all guesswork! That said, though, the battery icon stays forever at 3 bars, then once it goes to 2 bars it goes very quickly to zero. Better than nothing I suppose.One thing I found frustrating was that the wrist strap was next to impossible to put on the tiny and oddly angled loop on the camera body. Ultimately I had to link a loop of thread to the strap, attach the thread to a small piece of wire, and poke the wire and thread and strap into the loop on the camera body. It worked, but I wonder how that got past Canon's quality and design team.MAJOR SETBACK on this camera: Although I purchased a serial number much later than the ones with complaints of a \"Lens Error,\" I got the dreaded \"Lens Error\"! One random day the camera lens stayed telescoped in the \"out\" position and the screen gave the \"Lens Error\" notice and automatically shut itself off and wouldn't power back on. I was traveling at the time, so it was challenging to transport a camera with the lens sticking out and totally unprotected. Fortunately I was covered by my warranty, so I sent it for repair - but did unfortunately have to pay for my own shipping to Canon. The biggest disappointment was that it was under repair in early July, so I didn't get to take the dazzling low-light photos I had hoped to for July 4th fireworks! And when I got the camera back from Canon, it had some new scuffs on it.I give it 4 stars because although I had some mishaps with the camera, they had nothing to do with the actual photography experience itself.

If you are looking for a point-and-shoot camera, I don't think you will find a better one at this price. S100 has a larger sensor (1/1.7) as compared to majority of point-and-shoots (1/2.3). It captures a rich and deep color set. Good enough at low-light conditions, has a good manual control, has a built-in HDR, not the best one, but anyway, it does have, and also supports RAW image format. So in general, I consider this a great purchase. Before this one , I owned canon A630, which was I think even better, though an older model, but I dropped it one day, and some functions did not work properly. After a long research I found s100 to be most promising camera under $300, and I do not regret. The only drawback that I've seen yet is the short flash range, anyway it is not a problem for me, as I try to avoid using flash at all. Hope this helps.I am updating my review after some 3 months with a negative impression: everything is still good, but not great.

My old camera was a Canon A620. Its about 6 years old and been a great first digital camera for a beginner. I was thinking this time getting something nice a little more top of line. So I spent a lot of time reading and watching reviews. The RX100 had only been out a few months. All I heard were rave reviews about. So I bought my first $650 camera. When it came in I was kind of impressed. It was really high quality and small. So small and expensive I noticed my fingers hurting from holding it so tight. While trying to learn all of its functions. The first day after handling the RX100 I did not like it. Because it was so uncomfortable to hold for me. The edges were not rounded like most cameras. It had more of a square sharp edge. But after a while I got use to holding it and it became a little more comfortable.I ended up returning the RX100 in less than a month of owning it. Do to it draining the battery for no reason when not in use. 2 times while owning the camera it drained a full charged battery.I am just a novice when it comes to cameras. But honestly I felt my old A620 took better pics for me than the RX100. Which makes no since to me. I am glad I got rid of RX100.The Canon S100 right out of the box. I liked it a lot more than I did the RX100. It is so much more comfortable to hold with its nice round edges. I love this camera. I never felt that way about the RX100. Also I bought the S100 for 1/3 of the price of the RX100. Saved so much I bought the 2 year square insurance with it.Pros: super comfortable, shoots amazing pics.Cons: I see some say they don't like the S100 because it is plastic. But to me it seems like a super plastic. Kind of like a glock plastic. Seems tough to me. I would not call that a draw back. Only 2 cons I see so far. Recording video. There is a little a noise recorded when you use the zoom while recording. But not bad. And battery life could be problem.Recommendation if you buy the S100. Purchase a spare battery. They are cheap $13.Personal Con: I don't like the GPS. I know it can be turned off. But I don't trust there are not back doors into it. Just like cell phones were illegally spied on with out warrants. The gov said it was because 9/11 it started. But then we found out they had been listen to us since the 90's way before 9/11...

Harley", "ReviewID": "R3G4MVL9C8Q8YE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1/11/13 Update:  The class 10 card dramatically improved perfromance. I'm not sure why it required such a fast card to offer what I consider normal speed but it worked. As soon as I'm finished snapping one picture it's ready for another instantly.  There is no longer a momentary delay while it rights.  Of course, there's always the possibility that the first card might be bad, so I'm going to format it and try it in another camera to be sure.  It was a brand new card and that was the first camera I used it in.  My second comment is regarding the price.  My original review was based on the price at the time. It was well after Black Friday but still around the holidays when I purchased mine.  Now that the camera has been officially discontinued, prices have skyrocketed, by at least $100 most places (where you can still find it). That severly dampens my opinion of the value now because you can get the S110 for basically the same price.  So, if you didn't snatch one of these up during the inventory dump, I'd suggest looking at the S110 instead.  However, if by chance you can find an S100 for the price I mentioned earlier, then by all means, it's a no-brainer.  Buy it!Original Review---------------I bought one the other day because I've always wanted one but just couldn't justify dropping $400 for it. At $250 it's definitely a good buy for what you get. Fast f2.0 lens, large clear and bright LCD, manual controls, RAW capability and full 1080P HD recording to name a few items you get for the price.  Build quality is nice and solid.  The body makes me think of a miniature G12.  It is a bit larger than I expected. It replaced a Canon SD880-IS (which also gave me several years of beautiful photos) and I thought the S100 would be smaller than the SD880 but it's slightly larger.  The controls are well laid out and navigating through features is very easy.  Picture quality so far has been very good under a variety of shooting conditions. Daylight outdoor, indoor under tungsten and natural lighting, and even some candle light shots all came out well.  The image quality isn't going to make me forget I own a DSLR but is definitely very good nonetheless.  It has decent low-light and high-ISO performance but a downside is a softness and tendency to frequently over-expose in full auto.  It can be easily compensated for in manual but if you're a set and forget type, this may not be the best choice for a primary camera.  However, for me personally, I feel comfortable taking this as my primary camera anywhere a zoom is not needed. It's a perfect vacation cam due to the size and versatility.  I have a couple other minor complaints in addition to the indoor exposure.  One is lag. I have a class 6 card currently inserted and see a little lag between shots. I'm going to swap it with a class 10 card but that shouldn't necessary with this type camera and the type shooting I'm doing (basically all snapshots).  Another complaint is the flash. The position of it, top left, forces me to hold the camera in an awkward manner to avoid obstructing the flash when it pops up automatically.  It's a motorized flash, so obstructing it also raises the fear of possibly breaking it one day.  Other than these minor issues, I love this camera for its intended purpose, my primary go-to camera when I'm looking to travel light but want top notch quality and versatility.  At a price under $250, there is no way I couldn't recommend it.  I compared it to the S110 before purchasing and realized there isn't a ton of difference, especially considering they both use the same processor and are virtually identical spec-wise except a few areas that really don't convince me that the S110 is worth the extra cash.

Well my silver Canon S100 model number starts with 45 and even after using this several times no error messages or issues.  Spoke to Canon about this and they are aware of this issue, but factory sealed cameras with model numbers (the first two digits) from 45 and above should have no issues with the lens error issue.The Canon Powershot S100 camera is made in Japan but only the camera, compact disk, paperwork and cell in the lithium ion battery are actually made in Japan.  The charger for this Canon camera, the packaging of the battery and strap are made in China.  Not that is anything wrong with that, but I imagine there is some that are interested in that fact.  Another fact I'd like to point out is the milliampere-hour otherwise known as (mAh) is actually 1050, not what Amazon currently lists this as 1150.  That is a slight difference, especially to the person who buys this camera.The picture quality of this camera is exceptional and I take pictures with products with text and sometimes that text is rather small, yet I am still able to take a high quality picture of that item.  Some of these pictures were taken in broad daylight and the quality of the picture was still top notch.For those who are interested, should your charger ever want to repair or otherwise have a interest, to remove the Torx tamper resistant screw, you'll need a Torx tamper resistant drive size seven screwdriver bit or tamper resistant Torx wrench.  Once that screw is removed, all you need a spudger to remove the casing and the internal parts should be accessible.  As a disclaimer, I DON'T suggest this be done unless you absolutely know what your doing and even then I don't recommend doing this at all as this could void your warranty.Overall, this is great camera and if a simple to use, well built and designed camera that is also 12.1 megapixels this is the camera for you.One final note I'd like to add, to store my Canon Powershot S100 camera, I personally use the Leatherworks brand USA made suede leather pouch model number SLMPD.

I took the same \"Auto\" photos with my old Sony CyberShot DSC-W120 and with the new Canon PowerShot S100, and the comparison of the two sets of photos clearly showed that the Sony consistently produced pictures that were in sharp focus while the new Canon S100 did not.  And it didn't matter whether the photos were close-up or long range.There were other things that irritated me about the Canon S100, some of which may have been a matter of becoming used to it but, for instance, on the Sony, it is sufficient to turn the dial to movie mode and depress the shutter to shoot a movie but on the Canon, even when setting the dial to movie mode, one must still press the separate \"record button\" (and depress the shutter) to shoot a movie.The Canon's handbook (or operating manual) is 236 pages long (on a CD) and it isn't always logically written and compiled, that is, all the information that one might need, e.g., for shooting and downloading a movie, is not presented in one useful place.As others have noted, with the Canon, one must be careful to avoid holding the camera by its top left side, as that is where the flash pops up.Perhaps I had just not learned how to use it correctly but in the Auto mode, the Canon appears to have two choices - flash off or flash on, with the auto function of the camera deciding whether a flash is needed.  In situations where the background is bright (and thus the camera decides that a flash is not needed, even if one points the focus at a darker spot in the foreground), the flash doesn't fire.  Again, on the Sony, there is an option to use a \"fill-in\" flash, when one wants the foreground to be well-lit.Not withstanding the fact that the Canon S100 is clearly a very sophisticated camera, I felt that it was $429 poorly spent (largely because of the poor Image Quality) and so felt obliged to return the Canon PowerShot S100 to the shop where I had bought it (Best Buy).", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't buy it!

The S95, which followed almost exactly a year later, stuck with much the same formula - a relatively large sensor (at least in compact camera terms), a 28-105mm equivalent zoom lens with a fast F2 maximum aperture at wideangle, and a multi-functional control dial around the lens. But while its successor, the S100, looks much the same again on the outside, it is to all intents and purposes a brand new camera.Crucially, the S100's three key imaging elements are all entirely new. The lens range has been extended wider and longer, to a 24-120mm equivalent 5x zoom; it retains the fast F2 maximum aperture at wideangle but is limited to a rather less-impressive F5.9 at telephoto (an inevitable consequence of the camera's compact dimensions). Secondly the S100 debuts Canon's latest DIGIC 5 image processor, which the company says is six times faster than the previous version, allowing more sophisticated image processing and noise reduction. But perhaps most significantly, the S100's image sensor is a Canon-made 12.1 MP 'high sensitivity' CMOS sensor in the 1/1.7\" format (approx 7.5 x 5.5mm); only the second home-grown sensor the company has used in a compact camera after the PowerShot SX1 IS of 2008.Canon says the new sensor employs technology similar to that used in its EOS SLRs, including an on-chip noise cancellation system, and microlenses which cover more of the sensor area to improve its light-gathering characteristics. The company claims that this results in reduced noise and increased dynamic range; the maximum available ISO has accordingly been increased to 6400. A 4-channel readout system also improves the continuous shooting rate, up to 2.3 fps compared to the S95's maximum framerate of 1.9 fps. For real speed freaks there's also a scene mode that can capture 8 frames at an impressive 9.6 fps, but it's limited to JPEG images only, with no manual control.Compared to PowerShot S95 - key differencesThe S100 is in effect a whole new camera compared to the S95; almost every key feature has been upgraded or updated:  24-120mm (equivalent) lens range, F2.0-5.9, built-in neutral density filter  12.1 MP 1/1.7\" Canon CMOS sensor  DIGIC 5 image processor  ISO 80-6400  2.3 fps continuous shooting (9.6 fps for 8 frames in High-Speed burst mode)  Full HD (1080p24) movie recording; H.264 compression, MOV format  Optical zoom in movie mode  Super slow motion movie recording (640 x 480 @ 120fps, 320 x 240 @ 240 fps)  Direct movie record button  Built-in GPS unit with image tagging and logger functions", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon S100 Camera", "Author": "MARGARET DEWITT", "ReviewID": "R17V4KU2GL4B4J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Camera is excellent, however battery did not work.

I've taken some of the best inside shots of my family, ever, with the camera.I also like the longer focal length over my S90, and the high ISO performance (assuming I get the settings right for a scene).If you're a full auto mode user, you may be disappointed with the S100, especially if you don't use center (single area) autofocus. Learn to use P Mode and adjust settings (including Custom Color settings) as needed (eg. white balance, ISO, Exposure Compensation, Image Stabilization, saturation, Focus Mode and focus point size, etc). If you're not willing to learn how to tweak some of these settings, save yourself some money and buy a less expensive, real Point and Shoot camera.

I was quite excited to be the \"early bird\", yet I soon started to realize that I had made a terrible mistake purchasing it....I took this S100 along with the S95 and T3i for six field trips. Very frankly, I was SOOOOO disappointed with Canon at their inability to compete w/ the Nikon new series. It's quite obvious that Canon released this S100 in a hesitation!On one hand, it has to bring up sth to compete with Nikon, Sony, and other brands. On the other hand, Canon knows for sure that S100 has made so many trade-offs from the very beginning, which makes this camera a very bad choice for people who have been using S95 for quite a time.Here as below are my own experience:Pros - Unlike some people who claimed that the shooting speed is slow, I don't have any problem on this. I think the shooting speed is a bit faster than S95. But this won't make too much difference. Another great things are of course the GPS function and the 1080P video. Honestly, without these two functions, S100 is in NO WAY comparable to S95!!!Cons - Under auto modes, I found it sometimes hard to focus. And sometimes it took almost 5 seconds to focus yet with wrong objects..... So frustrated..... Second, under low light condition, the f/2.0 is not nearly powerful as it was supposed to be compared with S95. The picture I obtained was dark and orange rather than the bright and true-color ones produced by S95. Third, when you use manual settings, the ISO range is limited from 80, which is so unbelievable!! You may check reviews @ other major forums. People are reporting the same thing.... Can't believe this....Anyway, in general, I think S100 is kind of the trade-off product Canon has made. And it is definitely not a good one. It has some fansy functions, but who care??! The quality of the image is vital!!! And at the end of the day, I don't care if I have GPS or 1080P.

Many hobby and semi-professional photographers will say that you can't rely on any point and shoot to take great indoor photos of people, so I was afraid I would have to shell out for a DSLR, but decided to give this one a try before pouring a few hundred more dollars into a camera that I would be loathe to carry around. I am thrilled! In addition to wanting a small camera, I also wanted to be able to take indoor photos with no flash, because I hate how flash looks. This camera does that! Now, if my three year old is racing around in the house at night, I won't be able to capture that without flash, but taking \"normal\" kid photos where they are moving around, but not flying by is possible without flash with this camera (even in completely artificial light). It also has a lot of different \"effect\" settings that I usually would not bother with, but my husband has found a few that I really like. One unusual thing that this camera has that seems like a waste to me is the barrel zoom. There is no real barrel with this type of camera, so it's awkward to use and it will be wasted on most people since anyone who has used a point and shoot before is used to using the toggle lever to zoom (which this camera also has). It seems like a waste of weight and expense to have this redundant feature, but maybe some people like it. The other con, IMO, is if you use flash, it pops up right where you would be holding the camera. Fortunately, the mechanism seems really strong, so hopefully it won't break even after repeated deployment with one's finger firmly planted on top of it!Like some other reviewers, the first camera I was sent had the \"Lens read error,\" which did not seem to affect the function of the camera. I sent it back and the replacement hasn't had any problems.Overall, I am thrilled with this camera and I don't think I could find another point and shoot that would take such clear indoor photos.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great compact camera", "Author": "Gregory Windham", "ReviewID": "RRC33IENIVF7D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good communication from seller, good prices, prompt shipping, quality product.

Honestly, there is just no other camera out there with this size to performance ration. except for the RX100. But that beast is a good 2.5x the price of a s100.The Bad:1) Battery life is uhhhhh okayyy.

It's imagery was AWESOME when I 1st bought it, but I think too much time in powdery desert and maybe time in general degraded the sensor. It was never the same after BurningMan. I looked for a quality replacement after the lens recently got scratched from Kuwait sand.If you are looking for a TRUE pocket camera to take normal everyday pics, then buy one of those. They run significantly less than these and they are decent cameras with EXCELLENT portability (smaller than a pack of cigarettes).I bought this Powershot S100 at the same time as a Sony NEX 5N.I did a TON of research and if you want a DSLR quality camera that is \"compact\", look into the Sony NEX. There are cons to it (like expensive lenses and add-ons), but it is a GREAT camera for the price. I bought mine on sale for 425.00. They usually come with a standard 18-55mm lens which is great for my uses (see above).I also got this Canon S100 to have as an ELPH replacement.I haven't taken many pics with it yet and I haven't travelled with it, but it's a decent camera so far. I like the focus ring, menus, quality of AUTO mode, SCENES, movie mode quality and RAW image support. I bought mine on sale for 220.00It's a good everyday carry camera for that price. Had you paid over 300.00 I think you paid too much.Now if you dont understand Camera sensors etc. Keep this in mind. You will NEVER match a DSLR with a regular compact camera. The closest you will get to a DSLR in a \"compact\" is with a \"mirrorless\" 4/3 model. That's a WHOLE subject in and of itself.In that regard...until recently the way to go was with a 4/3 interchangeble lens camera. The Sony NEX has completely changed the rules providing a APS-C sized lens in a 4/3 body.(Think of APS-C cameras as those \"cheaper\" DSLR cameras like the Canon Rebel i3.)If you are looking for a fairly inexpensive camera to take GREAT pics but dont want to spend 800.00 - 1000 or more, look into a APS-C, or 4/3 interchangable lens camera. Period.You can find really good cameras in this range usually for 500-700If you want a \"pocket\" camera that takes \"GOOD\" pics, look into anything between 150.00 - 250.00. (Elphs are under 200.00)If you are looking into something inbetween \"good\" and \"great\" @ 200 - 400 and dont mind size too much, look into something like a Panasonic with a Leica lens (2/3\" or 1/2\" sensor). (still will NEVER match a APS-C sensor DSLR)If you are looking for a \"professional\" \"pocket\" camera to take GREAT pics...again, you're going to have to up your price to 400 and up.That all being said, this is a really GOOD pocket camera. The only thing I dont like about it is the lens shutter (part that closes over the lens when not in use) The Elph is like that as well and that's how the lens got scratched. That shutter is FLIMSY. Everything else on the camera feels like it's very well made.Matching up pics in the same environments between the Sony NEX 5N and this camera has provided me with a DEFINATIVE answer that in NO way can the two compete. They are on two COMPLETELY different levels of quality.I gave it 4 stars because for the price it's a really good pocket camera, but it does not \"WOW\" me. The Sony NEX 5N does.For 250 and under, The Canon Powershot S100 REALLY good. If you want something almost as good and even MORE pocketable, I suggest the ELPH. Keep in mind though that if you want decent video included, the ELPH is not going to cut it.I hope this helps. Finding the \"right\" camera for the price is REALLY tough.

Was invisible when viewed on the camera viewscreen - not enough resolution - but became visible when viewing photos or video at 100%.Also very annoying was the flash delay.  Most cameras set the exposure when you push the shutter button halfway down but this one doesn't for flash pictures.  Instead, it seems to take an initial flash to get the exposure, then a second flash to take the final picture.  I don't have equipment to time the delay but it's somewhere around a half-second.  That might not seem like much but it's an eternity if the subject is moving.Another annoying feature - the camera always chooses a low shutter speed and low ISO regardless of the mode, so in low light I'd get fine-grained but blurry photos of anything moving.  Fortunately there's a workaround for that problem (see below if you're still foolishly thinking of getting this camera)Another unfortunate feature (one that at least I knew of beforehand) is that the lens is 2.0 only at the 24mm setting and closes rapidly as you zoom in.  For me it's most noticeable when taking video in low light.  At 24mm the scene will look bright, but grow very dark as I zoom in.Tried desperately to find another camera with similar capabilities but at the time there weren't any (I should've waited a few more months) so I reluctantly bought another S100.  Big mistake.  After a few months (too long to return the camera to Amazon) I noticed a clicking noise in the videos.  Very obvious unless the background noise is loud.  There are lots of examples on Youtube.  I've talked to Canon and they seem oblivious.  First time I sent the camera in for repairs they responded that it was \"within normal operating parameters\", which means they did nothing.  The second time after long phone calls convincing the customer service rep to look at the camera again they sent it back saying the \"optical assembly did not operate properly\" and was replaced, but the very first time I tried it the noises were still there!  I still haven't gotten an honest answer from Canon if the clicking is normal or not.Gave it two stars because I really like the f2.0/24mm capability, but every time I pull this thing out I feel cheated.Bottom  line:  If you take photos of bowls of fruit, sunsets, or mountain lakes then maybe you'll be ok.  If you take snapshots of friends and family then you'll be endlessly frustrated like me.  DON'T GET THIS CAMERA!!!!!If you're stuck with an S100 there are a few workarounds:For the shutter speed problem choose Shutter Priority mode (Tv) and set the desired shutter speed to what you'd prefer (typically 1/250 to 1/500 for action)  Then in the menu settings make sure \"Safety Shift\" is ON.  The camera will try to take photos at the desired shutter speed by upping the ISO or opening the aperture, and only if it can't will it lower the shutter speed.For the clicking video use manual focus.  There are several major problems - first of all obviously the camera won't autofocus so if you aren't good at estimating distances, or not good focusing with the viewscreen, or more importantly if you subject moves then you're out of luck.  Second, it takes several button pushes to get the camera into manual focus so there's a delay.  Again, only a few seconds but if you're taking snapshots then key moments can easily disappear in those few seconds.  The camera won't stay in manual focus when turned off so you'll have to change to manual focus each time you turn on the camera.  Third, video and photo modes keep the same focus settings, so if you go to manual focus for video you have to remember to go back to autofocus for photos.  If you forget then your photos will be out of focus!", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great user interface and manual controls, average image quality.", "Author": "delbarcelona", "ReviewID": "R36LIIY902SIQF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that this camera has one of the nicest designsI have seen/used on a compact camera. The size is perfect as is themenu layout and the user interface. The manual controls are great andfor the most part logical and intuitive.After using the camera for almost two weeks I got some mixed thoughts.The camera is a total joy to use and makes you wanna use the manualmodes and try different things and get creative because it makes itreally easy. Accessing things like ISO, WB, exposure compensation,bracketing, etc. is really simple and you can customize it to make itwork almost the way you want. Very cool indeed!The problem I had with the camera has more to do with image qualitythan anything else (both photos and video). I decided to give this onea try mostly based on the positive reviews and popularity of both theS95 and S90, hoping it would be a camera that would cover most ofmy photographic needs (at least on paper it was).I tested this camera along with a Sony HX9V. Have beentaking the same pictures with both, under the same light conditionsand with the closest camera settings I can use. The S100 beats theSony in most low light situations for obvious reasons (2.0 vs 3.5 maxaperture). But in almost every other situation: moderate, bright,overcast, indoors, landscape... the HX9V produces better results outthe camera without further processing. I wasn't impressed with the results of the S100 at ISOs over 400 and was especially disappointed with the auto WB results.Focusing, although fast and accurate when there's enough light available, israther slow in low light, and in many cases not able to lockfocus.The images produced by the S100 were not vibrant, sharp and detailedenough for me. They were a little on the noisy side at high ISO andthe color rendition was a little inaccurate, I'm guessing due to poor AutoWhite Balance.Video looks really nice and clear as long as you don't move thecamera. I mean, image stabilization works really well, don't take me wrong; the problem iswhen you start panning right and left, up/down that it looks reallybad. The frame rate of this camera I believe is 24fps so it's not very smooth. If you watchthe video on anything that's bigger than 20 inches, it looks so bad (the panning) thatalmost makes you dizzy.So I guess for someone who's not very concerned about photo and video quality, and is looking more for features, full manual controls, compact size and a nice user interface, this camera would be worth serious consideration. Or you can just buy a camera that will give you the same kind of JPEGs for half the price. I'm trying to get the best possible pictures without the need of much post processing (if I wanted to do that I would just shoot RAW with my DSLR).I decided to return it to BB today and will be getting the Sony NEX-5N instead.

But I really wanted a regular pocket camera so I waited for and order the S100 pretty close to announcement day and got it last week.The camera certainly does a lot and has a lot of easy to use menu options for customizing the camera. But at the end of the day, there are two features I look for in a camera:1. Picture Quality2. Ergonomics (control layout)Picture Quality is pretty good. Although not as high a quality as the Nikon AW100 is an apples/oranges comparison I suppose. But just point-n-shoot produces descent images but I've seen better on other cameras of this size.Night shots were very good too, but again, \"compared to what\"? But what I say to people who ask \"I have yet to take a great picture with the S100\".Some new point & shot cameras are using the new style CMOS chips with the \"wires on the back\" of the sensor. I used one recently (the AW100) and it is like night vs day in picture quality. The S100 uses a \"new for Canon Powershot\" chip, but it is still front-wired. Not my job to write about that technology, read up on it if you're interested.Ergonomic design is where the S100 really fails. The power button, shutter release and mode Dial are not well thought out at all. The mode dial should not be where it is--it blocks access to the shutter release. This causes you to have to reach over it to take a picture--it is obviously in the way, so why not put it elsewhere, like on the top right side of the back of the camera like they've done in so many other Canon PowerShot models.If you have the camera to someone and ask them to take your picture, you have the inevitable situation where they try to press the Mode button and you have to show them where the shutter release is located.The shutter release button is difficult to find--you're body just expects it to be the dominate button on top of the camera.Next is the Flash--cool idea and looks good in a demo video on a website, however in practice in 100 percent of the cases, my left hand is holding a finger over to the top of the flash as it tries to popup. Fortunately unlike some older Canon powershots with this feature, this set of power gears is stronger--and doesn't get stripped when you do this (which you will) like some older powershots did. Where are you supposed to hold the camera?All in all, this camera is going back. If it were a $200 camera, I'd probably keep it I the glove box of my car for quick & dirty shots, but for $429 its going back to Amazon.

Adobe has not yet added the S100 to their camera file.  You can not process raw or JPEG images in CS 5 at all.  I assume that means you can't process in lower versions of Photoshop as well.  Hopefully,  Adobe will update the Camera Raw processor soon and include the S100.  By the way, the Canon processing software included with the camera is LAME.Edit 12/21/11:  As several comments point out, the recent release of Raw 6.6 now allows processing of raw files in CS 5.  Turns out my inability to process Jpegs was due to my card reader.  My older card reader would not read the new SD 8GB card. My SLR's use CF and this is my first SD card camera.  An new card reader solved the problem.  Been using the camera now for few weeks.  Lots of functions, many of which I'll never use.  Picture quality is very good (but not excellent).  Color quality very good.  Sharpness, good.  Speed, very good.  Low light very good.  Noise, good to very good. Video, have not used much.  I upgraded my rating from 3 to 4 stars.

Granted, Canon does provide the \"Solutions Disk\" with the pdf file of the manual. But what good does it do me when I am out of the house trying to take a picture? Are they thinking that I will be carrying my PC on my excursions? Or do they think that I can just commit all of the complexities of the S100's various operating modes to memory? Unfortunately, neither of these solutions work for me. I would not have bought the S100 if I knew that \"in an effort to be a more green company and better protect our environment, Canon no longer offers the small printed manuals with our PowerShot cameras.\" After having paid over $300 for a camera, that was the response I got to my inquiry about ordering a printed version of the user's guide from Canon.

The FPS (if you can call it that) is almost as slow is my 880DS from 3 years ago (over a second, too late for me). Not to mention that at least 1/3 of the pictures come out blurry when on the auto setting.

Future buyers may want to do a little more research than I.I read many glowing reviews,studied comparisions between cameras, technical specs and etc from a variety of websites...some seemed biased, some did not; but then noticed the internet notice from July 2, 2012 about a recall for \"lens error\".  Googling that phrase I found many, many dissapointed consumers of this model and cannon in general, specifically for their rough treatment of dissapointed customers.I gave it 3 stars based on the many glowing reviews, but less than 5 because of the very many disspointed and angry consumers posting about the quality.  I will keep this updated, but to any future consumers; be sure to do your homework before deciding.Oct 1OK...I said I would update my original post in time and I am doing so:I received the camera in good condition and specified amount of time.  I've been using it nearly daily for 3 weeks.Good:The camera certainly can do alot of things...there are many features that should satisfy both the most basic shutterbug and keep the pros pretty happy too ( like RAW file and fairly advanced controls.The camera has some pretty cool features like the ability to capture only one color and turn all the other colors grey scale (think of capturing all the orange pumkins in a pumpkin patch and leaving everything else in gray scale).  It can do slow motion video at 240 fps.  There are other cameras on the market for slightly more than can now capture at 1,000 fps.There is an adjustment ring on the front of the camera that allows additional control beyond the usual thumbwheel/rocker button on the back of most P&S;cameras and it is user setable.The not so goodPer the manufacture, the camera should not be exposed to temperatures above 104 F.  There are many places in the US that get above that every day in the summer, so I guess photo of the AZ desert are out.The battery life states 200 shots or 40 mins of video.  I found it to be less than that ( amout 1/2 ) in the course of a day with no flash and one or two videos.  I purchased an extra battery ( ~$30)Concerned about the dreaded \"lens error\" issue I wrote Cannon to see if they have made a permanent fix.  I never heard back.  From a quality/customer service standpoint this is unacceptable.  ( I'm a quality manager)Would I recomend this camera?Not for this price.  It can do alot of things, is intuitive to use; but based on the \"lens error\" reports widely on the web, the short battery life, the lack of response from Cannon customer service and most troubling the 104F max temperature limit.
