The Z800 is a great camera to have in your pocket for casual photography - light and thin. I especially like to feature that takes rapid fire flash / no flash captures for comparison later. I also like the large, bright display and touch screen functions. The negatives so far is that you need to be extra gentle on the shutter release for a crisp spot and the battery life needs to be improved.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not Bad", "Author": "AFGUY", "ReviewID": "R3O3AYH5PWJ4HH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "nd own an earlier version.The Good:  Zippy with loads of options, touch screen. does all i require from a cameraThe Bad:  Little more bulky than I was looking for.Overall:  I should have just kept my old camera.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice looking, great touchscreen, and more, but...", "Author": "SeBo \"seb6000\"", "ReviewID": "R1BG23M81C8LXE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice looking, great touchscreen, and more, but...Well I thought I'd found myself a reasonably priced camera that I could use as an everyday point and shoot, that fits nicely into my pants pocket, and although this is a very compact, stylish camera, that comes in multi-colors, has a fantastic touchscreen with 460k, its software operations are fast, easy menu maneuver, and can do 360 image capturing. Yes, these parts are far above any other recently released cameras (of this style) on the market, that I've tested.But for me there were a couple of deal breakers. I'm not getting into a lot of details in my review, I just need a few things to work at what I think are now minimal standards for cheap point and shoot cameras.If you need full specs, go to their website and compare...BUT,Video movies are important to me and some functions need to work in this process or this can be a deal breaker for me. Most everyone's got at least 720P now days, and I like the availability of an easy to operate movie option, but I also need the camera to perform, in low light, have both zoom and image stabilization options before I add it to my collection. For me.. and for a $210 priced camera, this thing hasn't got it. I've had better for around $130 cheaper.- Fuji is one the best at low light imaging, but this one fails badly in video and in some imaging (ISO 3200) when they have far better than this on their shelves.- Video: I've already tested a few recent Fuji's camera, and the Z800exr doesn't even shoot as good of video as their cheapest camera: $69 - Fuji JV100. Next the zoom doesn't work in the movie mode, I hate that. If it had worked I probably would have kept this camera. Image stabilization, non-existent in movie mode.---Overall the touchscreen is the best part of this camera. It fails (for me) pretty much everywhere else, unless you're only going to use it for daylight operations.Be nice if they'd put this touchscreen system on all their point and shoot cameras, but gave us all the options of say what the j/f series include.--> Bad smile face from me :(Still searching for a quality, cheap, all around, pocket camera.
