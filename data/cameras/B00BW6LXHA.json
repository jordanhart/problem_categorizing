{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The most compact Rebel, but few small lens choices", "Author": "D. Alexander", "ReviewID": "R220987TBNN8XP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very compact DSLR similar in ability and layout to a Rebel T2i/T3i for stills. Enhanced autofocus has made it Canon's best DSLR for point-and-shoot style movies (superseded by the 70D in 2014). Paired with small primes, it makes for an exceedingly capable travel camera. Larger kits can make the T5i preferable. Smaller kits come more readily from mirrorless cameras with smaller senors.==== Rebel T5i:18 MP5 fps9-point AF w/ 9 cross pointsHybrid AF w/ 9% frame coverage1080p/30, 720p/60Articulating touchscreenStereo mics13m flash range20 oz==== Rebel SL1:+ 14 oz, 30% smaller by volume+ Hybrid AF w/ 64% frame coverage-- 4 fps-- fixed touchscreen-- 9 point AF w/ 1 cross point-- 9.4m flash range-- mono micDIFFERENCES:* Size.This is the smallest DSLR from any make. It's a whole size tier below the T5i and level with a number of mirrorless bodies. Whether that's a worthwhile ergonomic compromise depends on the use case. With a small lens like a 40/2.8, the combined package reduces to prosumer point-and-shoot dimensions. Anything more ample (even the kit 18-55) and the bulk of the lens rapidly offsets the SL1's space efficiency.In-hand, the SL1 is a fingertip camera. The palm of my large right hand doesn't rest easily against the body without finger contortions, so support comes mostly from the left under the lens. It feels (and looks) lilliputian if you're used to larger DSLRs, but that's the only real adjustment; the button layout has no surprises relative to the T2/3/4/5i.* Single cross-point AF.First, context: Canon uses autofocus to differentiate between DSLRs. More expensive cameras tend to have 'better' autofocus. Precisely what that means, and whether it matters, depends on your requirements. With the addition of movie capability, we've got three parameters to consider: stills with static subjects, stills with movement, and movies with movement. A complicating factor is that performance depends greatly on whether you're shooting through the viewfinder or from the rear LCD (\"Live View\"). Unlike point-and-shoot and mirrorless bodies, Canon DSLRs (and all others save Sony's) have two entirely separate autofocus systems.When I talk about 'phase-detect' AF and 'cross-points', these are characteristics of the viewfinder AF system. The SL1's phase-detect AF array has 9 points. Only the center point is a cross-point. Cross-points (shaped like a +) detect contrast in any orientation. The 8 outer points (shaped like lines) only see contrast that's near perpendicular to them. The practical implication is that the T4i/T5i will be somewhat faster and more consistent with off-center compositions with wide-aperture lenses (e.g., 50/1.8) and motion-tracking.Both systems outperform the contrast-detect focus in any current mirrorless body with motion. You focus through an optical viewfinder that'll never wash out, show noise in dim lighting, lag the action, or smear colors. In exchange, you lose the clever information overlays of electronic viewfinders (EVF), the face tracking that's become a part of many contrast-detect systems, and the precise matching between what the EVF shows and the camera records.Here's the phase-detect breakdown for this body:VF, stills, static: fast and accurate in frame-centerVF, stills, movement: moderately fast and accurate in frame-centerVF, movies, any subject: not possibleThis is the same AF array as in the T2i/T3i. If you were happy with those bodies, you'll be equally so with this one.* Hybrid AF II.In the T3i and prior, Live View focusing from the rear LCD was achieved by contrast-detect. This method is vastly slower than phase-detect and, in Canon's DSLR implementation, isn't capable of tracking motion in movies. It's reasonably quick and quite accurate with stills. It isn't possible to use the main phase-detect array without interrupting Live View because a mirror gets in the way.The T4i/T5i added a second phase-detect system integrated into the imaging sensor itself that boosted acquisition speed and improved motion tracking to mediocre/adequate levels, but only for the center 9% of the frame. The SL1 expands this system to 64% frame coverage. The result is significantly more confidence with continuous autofocus in movies. With off-center subjects, it hunts (bringing the scene in and out of focus) much less than the T4i/T5i.Here's the contrast-detect breakdown:LV, stills, static: reasonably fast and accurate over the whole frameLV, stills, movement: slow, accurate when it can keep upLV, movies, static: reasonably fast, occasional huntingLV, movies, movement: slow, accurate when it can keep upMotion tracking is still short of exceptional. STM lenses (which use a stepper motor instead of standard USM or a noisy micro-motor) work more quickly and precisely than non-STM lenses. They'll track slow, undemanding subjects and faces. For more challenging movement, either prefocus, manually focus, or jump to the next performance tier comprised of Sony's 'translucent mirror' DSLRs, many mirrorless bodies (e.g., Panasonic G/GH), and Canon's own 70D. The SL1 has no focusing aids (e.g., focus peaking) for Live View except full-screen zoom. Focusing accurately by hand on a moving target is very challenging.OTHERWISE:Everything else is to lesser consequence. A slightly weaker flash, a slightly slower framerate, a smaller battery, one less microphone channel. Even the loss of LCD articulation isn't much of a bother unless you're continually shooting from vantage points away from the viewfinder.A major advantage of the SL1 is that, like the T4i/T5i, it has a new touchscreen that that significantly lowers the EOS learning curve. It's capacitive and almost as responsive as a modern smartphone. Adjusting functions (e.g., exposure, white balance, focus points; everything) is as simple as tapping what you want. The camera won't be at the ready when you're manipulating the LCD, but thanks in part to an integrated 'feature guide' that explains most options, you probably won't need to pull out the manual on first acquaintance.Phone gestures (e.g., pinch zoom, swiping) are now part of the picture review system, which makes checking focus vastly quicker and more flexible than on any other non-touch EOS body. Focus itself is touch-enabled in Live View mode, so you can tap to focus on static subjects anywhere in the frame without ever having to manipulate the 9-point AF system.The interface isn't necessarily intuitive, but photography in general isn't intuitive. There's a large gulf between a design for novice users that hides complication and one for experienced users that makes powerful features easily accessible. By offering redundant touch controls, Canon straddles this line surprisingly well. This is a camera that can grow with you.STILLS QUALITY:This sensor is functionally identical to those in the T2i/T3i/T4i/T5i/60D/7D save for the pixels devoted to phase-detect. Noise and dynamic range are similar in raw. Expect acceptable results up to ISO 3200. Nikon's D5100 is slightly better, Sony's A65 slightly worse. It's about two solid stops better than a typical point-and-shoot.Unless you're in a JPEG-only shooting mode (e.g., multi-shot NR, HDR), raw gets the most out of this camera. JPEG often lacks the flexibility for significant changes in post. Raw shooting also lets you defer decisions (e.g., white balance, sharpening, noise reduction, color, lens corrections, tone curves, and even exposure) that distract from catching whatever moment you're after.That aside, if your scene and shooting technique don't call for major adjustments on the computer, you're likely to be pleased with the JPEG output.LENSES:The 18-55/3.5-5.6 STM is a stellar optic. Focus is as fast as the camera allows, near-silent, and inaudible in movies, as is the IS system. If you upgrade, it'll be for speed, a different range, or perhaps more contrast, not because it isn't sharp enough. The 18-135/3.5-5.6 STM is equally impressive, though about an inch longer and twice the weight.Light and small primes are well-suited to this body. The 40/2.8 STM, 50/1.8, 28/1.8, and 28/2.8 are all more compact than the kit lens. Larger lenses work as with any other EOS body, though some will be slightly more awkward when you're trying to adjust the zoom ring and support the rig from under the lens at the same time.ACCESSORIES:For video, buy SD cards 32 GB or larger. My pair of 16 GB cards have been inadequate for even a one-day event. The highest recording quality uses 350 MB/minute, equating to about 90 minutes per 32 GB card. For stills (~7 MB in JPEG and ~25 MB in raw), two or three 8 GB cards is plenty.Interface responsiveness isn't much affected by card speed. Faster cards have three advantages: they can shoot longer bursts at 4 FPS, clear the picture buffer more quickly, and record video at the highest quality without risking a speed warning. Buffer depth is 28 JPEGs and 7 raw files with a standard SD card. Buffer cycling times are much lower with UHS-1 ('Ultra High Speed'). In one-shot mode, this difference is invisible; very fast cards would only make sense if you were time-limited on card-to-computer transfers with a USB 3.0, SATA, or Firewire card reader.If you buy protection filters for your lenses, try Hoya's \"DMC PRO1 Clear Protector Digital\" line. They have very high light transmission and cause no visible flare. Digital sensors filter UV natively, there's no reason to pay more for that feature. I've written reviews on the relevant Hoya product pages with more details and why you might (or might not) want a filter.IN SUM:Whether this DSLR is your huckleberry depends on your priorities. This is new territory for Canon. The SL1 is sized to compete with mirrorless, but the EOS lens line doesn't have many compact options to pair with it. And it never will, because the SL1 uses an APS-C sensor, the second-largest available. That applies doubly for Canon's mirrorless EOS-M, which looks like a deck of cards beneath an Evian bottle when attached to any of the f/2.8 zooms or longer telephotos.Canon's lens line is simultaneously the greatest strength and weakness of this body. The EOS mount makes accessible some extraordinary and unique high-dollar glass. If you want to shoot supertelephotos, or real tilt-shift, or superfast primes that see in the dark, or macro lenses that'll fill the frame with Roosevelt's head on a dime, there's no other system that has it all under one umbrella. And if you've already invested in it, the SL1 is the obvious choice.But what if that's not you? What if you plan to stay with the general-purpose lenses that just about every system contains? The advantages of the SL1 narrow considerably. They are: subject isolation, motion tracking with stills, the immediacy of an optical viewfinder, and Canon's highly polished user interface.Relative to a M4/3s body like Panasonic's G6, the SL1 will have more foreground and background blur at any given aperture. If you're all about creamy backgrounds for portraiture, the difference is noticeable. You can still isolate with M4/3s, it just takes a closer subject and more telephoto.Motion tracking for stills used to be a huge arrow in the SL1's quiver. It still is relative to most mirrorless bodies, though recent ones have gotten surprisingly fast. Likewise for low-light focusing, formerly a mirrorless weakness. Still, if your subjects are often running children, or anything that moves toward or away from you at high speed, the SL1 will have a higher hit-rate.The optical viewfinder is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you're seeing the scene in real-time with no processing delays from imaging hardware. On the other, you're not seeing what the camera sees. The DSLR shooting process involves a lot of chimping, where you take the shot with the viewfinder and immediately check the exposure with the rear LCD. Not so with mirrorless: what you see is what you get, for better or worse. The SL1 finder maintains an edge with fast action and in very dark conditions that'll cause OLED/LCD viewfinders to fade to black.And then we have Canon's UI. They've polished it for thirty years and the effort shows, particularly relative to recent entrants like Sony's NEX line. But Panasonic and others are closing the gap. This SL1 isn't the only camera with a touchscreen and logical menus. More to the point, mirrorless bodies are often less clunky than the strange amalgam of 'Live View' and traditional mirror shooting that defines this camera and other DSLRs. That may well consume the SL1's advantage.So what conclusions?If you're all about small size and you can sacrifice the SL1's advantages, mirrorless is where you want to be. The Olympus OM-series leads the pack now in this price range. Tomorrow, the leader may be something else.If you want to pair this body with fast, high-dollar EOS lenses or bulky accessories like an external flash, the T5i is a better alternative. The cost difference disappears into the system cost. The SL1 maintains an advantage with continuous focus in movie-mode, but lags everywhere else.If you want the smallest possible EOS-compatible body, the EOS-M has identical image quality in a truly miniature package. After a recent firmware update, it's now acceptably fast at focusing, though still well behind the SL1 in general responsiveness.But if your priorities favor DSLRs, hands-off autofocus in movies, and small size, the SL1 is the best choice in Canon's arsenal. A compromise, yes, but a good one.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Entry Level DSLR with Advanced Ability", "Author": "S Mack", "ReviewID": "R2IW1NHTFXGGOQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Im a casual photographer, who travels a lot and wanted a SLR to take with me. I also want to enhance my photography as a hobby, although I don't plan on ever being professional. I've owned several compact digital prior to this camera.Size:Even though I knew what I was ordering, I couldn't get over the size. It's so small for an SLR and so lightweight. I've checked multiple times because I didn't think it was loaded in my bag, it felt empty. No kidding, it's that light weight. But still has all the buttons you need, well placed and easy to operate.  It also feels tough and durable, so don't be dissuaded by the light weight or small size. I'm not sure about the concern some voiced about it being \"too small\" to hold. It's very comfortable. If you are going to shoot for 2 hours straight and/or have shot with a larger camera for 5 years, then maybe this would take some getting used to. But it's very easy to manage, comfortable to hold and feels solid in my hand.Performance:I've been experimenting for a couple months now with various settings, different creative shots and I love the camera. Any failures are certainly mine as an amateur. It's easy to shoot, fast enough (I'm not shooting for the NHL) and takes accurate, colorful pictures that are only limited by my creativity. I've shot macro, landscape, architecture, pets and portraits. I love it. It has a deep, feature rich set of custom options, menus and settings. I'm almost addicted to loading my amazing photos into a post photo software (name omitted) and playing with them to see how incredible they can get. That being said, they look incredible (when composed properly) straight from the RAW image. Also remember, this is a canon, so you can use virtually any lens ever created by them.Video:The improved AF Focus and STM lens is evident when shooting video. Video is amazingly clear, the AF does a good job keeping up with most subjects (again not shooting NHL or nocturnal animal scenery). The touchscreen, nearly silent lens combo is a huge improvement over prior versions. All but the most demanding professionals will find it does a remarkable job.Cons:Not many, seriously.No built in stereo mic..(minor issue use an external)No built in wifi (use an eye fi card)I kept this simple as there are some more technical reviews out there. I thought simple usage from a consumer standpoint would be most helpful. My advice, be very careful hanging your hat on some of the Amazon reviews that are overly technical. Some of the reviewers don't know as much as they pretend and quote erroneous facts, like the fact that this camera uses \"contrast phase detect\" for it's auto focus. Wrong, older canon's did, not this one.  If you really need the technical details read a review by dpmag, dppreview, camera labs etc. They will be spot on accurate and not a pseudo  professional opinion. Happy hunting...If you found this helpful, please click yes! Thank you.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best combination of image quality, viewfinder, and size", "Author": "Doctor.Generosity", "ReviewID": "R1F5OCNJIB76ZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am impressed with my new Canon SL1 with the 18-55 kit lens. As a long time dedicated amateur photographer with a shelf full of other equipment, including fancier and much more expensive equipment, this will now be the one I take with me and use most of the time. Here's why:* Incredibly small and incredibly light. The biggest single reason for the recent spate of mirrorless cameras (Sony NEX, Fujifilm X) is now negated! I am sitting here looking at the SL1 next to my Fujifilm XE-1 with a comparable 18-55 zoom lens. The SL1 is lighter and smaller than the Fuji mirrorless camera with its electronic viewfinder. The SL1 optical viewfinder, while more compressed than the one in a large high-end DSLR, to my eyes is still far superior to any electronic viewfinder, which is like looking at a fuzzy little television from the 1960's. Canon appears to have achieved the small size by repackaging the sensor and shutter; impressive engineering and I expect that Nikon and others will have to follow suit. Let's hope we will now see a new generation of tiny DSLRs.*Image quality: OK you say, it's small. So what am I giving up? Answer is - not really much. Image quality is excellent. The electronics of sensors have advanced rapidly in the last few years and the newest entry level camera is going to perform better than the high end product you bought two years ago. And new half frame sensors may be comparable to full frame sensors from a few years back. Also, the entry level DSLR market is the most competitive. Nikon (D3200) and Canon (SL1 or T5) are forced to give you more for your money than with high end full frame cameras. The SL1 is a bargain. Yes, you can get a marginal improvement in images and controls by going up market, but you will pay 3X as much in dollars, and in weight, and in volume. The cost of any technology is usually on a log scale; 90% of state of the art costs X and 95% costs 3X and 99% costs 9X. It makes no sense to ride this curve unless you do very specialized or commercial photography. For most of us, the most important thing is whether we have the camera with us when the photo opp comes up.*Comparison. The images coming out of this Canon SL1 are lovely, contrasty and with excellent colors. I compared directly with my full frame Nikon D600 and also Sony NEX 6 at ISO 400. Results; unless you are a fanatical pixel peeper, they are all in the same ballpark. Only by blowing up the central 10% to fill the computer screen can one begin to see significant differences. If you do make this extreme blowup, the full frame D600 had the cleanest, lowest noise, and finest detail. But then the D600 costs 4X the SL1 and weighs more than twice as much! And anyway, does it really matter if some other sensor is s-l-i-g-h-t-l-y better? No it doesn't. Having the 'best' equipment is just not the determining factor in capturing beautiful photos that I will take pride in years down the road. The SL1 gives me 90% of the quality I will get from any camera anywhere at 1/4 the cost of a high end DSLR. The main difference is that the viewfinder is cramped and the settings are in menus rather than dedicated buttons. Big deal. You can still do any creative thing you want and win photo contests with this camera.*How about the kit lens?: Just fine. By profession I am interested in the details of lens design and I admire beautiful finely crafted Zeiss lenses just as much as as the next fanatic. But as a photographer I can tell you that for actually capturing once-in-a-lifetime handheld photo opportunities with a sharp high quality image, there are two things that matter much more than ultimate optical quality: a) image stabilization and b) zoom so you can scale the desired image to fill your sensor. Are high quality prime lenses \"better?\" In practical terms, usually not. For most photography, they will not produce a more detailed image unless your camera is on a tripod and the scene just happens to be matched to the focal length. For general opportunistic or travel photography, squeezing out the last iota of lens quality is close to irrelevant. This is especially so these days when the camera JPG engine corrects typical lens defects such as distortion and chromatic aberration automatically. Modern lenses no longer have to be perfect in the glass; they all end up pretty much alike after the software corrections are applied. This is also why spending hours diddling around with RAW images in Photoshop no longer makes much sense for most of us - the JPEG engine has been programmed to optimize the specific lens - and it will take much time and skill to equal or improve on this on one's own. Today, post processing is not optional so JPEG is how cameras should be judged.Image stabilization in particular has a lot more to do with sharpness for handheld photos then ultimate lens quality. The stabilization on this Canon lens works fine, showing its best advantage with shutter speeds around 1/10 to 1/25 second and giving effective reduced jitter as if you were shooting at 1/200. (If the required exposure is much slower than 1/25, let's say 1/5 or slower, even IS will not help - and if it's much faster, don't need IS and it won't improve anything.) And as noted, using a zoom has a lot bigger impact on quality then the niceties of a prime lens because one doesn't need to crop down. If I crop to the central 1/4 of the image area because my lens did not frame the scene optimally, I am throwing away 3/4 of my pixels, so I no longer have 18MP anyway. Overall results will be better with a zoom, even if it's optically imperfect.*So is mirrorless no longer needed? There is one factor which does still favor mirrorless over SLR; the size of lenses, which are limited by the laws of physics and the long flange-to-sensor distance that comes with an SLR mirror. For the Canon SL1 or any SLR, zoom lenses will usually be bigger than the body. So I also bought the 40mm f2.8 Canon pancake lens which is compact for walk-around, although if I have to use a fixed lens I would prefer a wider angle. Canon makes a dozen other mid range zooms such as the 15-85, but you will have to accept a weight of 575-645 g compared to 205 g for the kit lens. In fixed focal lengths, Canon also makes two nice wide angle (24 mm and 28mm) lenses with image stabilization that weigh only 260-281 g and would offer a good match for the SL1. The 50mm f1.8 should be considered instead of the 40mm; faster and costs less. And of course you may already own a shelf full of Canon EF or EF-S lenses.*But isn't the SL1 plasticky? Yes, it is plasticky, and there are tacky \"sculpted\" buttons on the back, ala consumer cameras, and the shutter release is not as snappy as my Nikon D600. It does not give the impression of a professional tool. I regret that Canon interpreted \"small and light\" as \"entry level;\" I would have been willing to pay more for a compact but higher precision package. But it's also very light. And it's so handy I'm going to take it with me when I travel as opposed to leaving my big full frame Nikon at home. And if it gets stolen or dropped, not such a tragedy. Every camera is a compromise. In my opinion enthusiasts sometimes obsess too much over 'build quality.' Yes, there is a tactile pleasure to high precision Leicas from the 1950's, but that kind of mechanical quality is no longer necessary for quality photos. Cameras today, like so many other products are made of plastic and software but the results - photographs - are better than ever.*Interface and ease of use. Canon along with all other Japanese camera brands cram their interfaces with all sorts of useless clutter in the form of indecipherable icons, unnecessary modes and confusing redundancies. What does that odd little icon which looks like an upside down flag with a teardrop mean? Why not just use plain old WORDS to label it? And has anyone you know actually used the \"Food Mode?\" Is it really more convenient to have three or four redundant ways to change the ISO setting, or just confusing? Canon and the other makers should really drastically simplify the whole thing - look at your iPhone, which does many more things than a camera but has very few icons and labels and buttons. All the major Japanese cameras have the same overly complicated philosophy, but the SL1 Canon is somewhat easier to figure out than most, and the touch screen is a definite plus. In any case, although this is considered an 'entry level' DSLR, the full manual nevertheless runs to 388 pages, so plenty of options. There is also a remote control available as an option, to get yourself in family photos or for nature photography. In short, there is very little you can't do with the SL1.*Flaws? There is one real photographic deficiency. When I switch to Live View for still photos (this means lock up the mirror and use the LCD to frame photos, like a point-and-shoot), the autofocus becomes very slow and hunts for a lock. The mirrored autofocus runs on a fast phase detection principle but in Live View the sensor focusses using some combination of contrast detection (slow in poor light) with special phase pixels. The solution; don't use Live View for still photos, keep it for movies. Other minor annoyances: the on/off switch is not in the most natural place. Also the optical viewfinder picture is not only cramped but also does not capture 100% of the full sensor field; more like 79%, so you will have to learn to compensate by overfilling the viewfinder frame a bit. I wish the buttons on the back were bigger (Note to Canon: Just because the back of the camera is small does not mean the buttons have to be small - get it?) Finally the flash pops up when I don't want it to, although there is mode dial setting to suppress that.*Movies. Since one cannot use the optical SLR viewfinder to make movies, an SLR like this is not really the best camera for movies. In you want to concentrate on movies, the Sony NEX design is much better suited.*Bottom line: This is a great little state of the art camera and lens which takes lovely still photos without much fuss in an affordable tiny package. It benefits from the latest up to the minute sensor technology, the photos are quite comparable to high end mirrorless or other half frame DSLR cameras and only slightly inferior to full frame costing much more and weighing much more. Yes, it is cluttered with too many modes and icons, but they all do that. With the kit lens you get the benefits of zoom and image stabilization and still the overall package is very portable. There is very little one might wish to do in art photography which cannot be done with the SL1. Speaking for myself, a small half-frame camera with an optical viewfinder is just the ticket - the best overall combination of image quality, viewfinder and functionality for the size and weight. It seems to me that the main justification for half frame mirrorless designs with electronic viewfinders has been negated. Is there a time when I won't use the SL1? Yes, for street photography where people may be intimidated by having a camera pointed at them - the Sony NEX with its articulated rear display is better for that. But for any photography where SLR works best, Canon has produced an advance similar to that of the Olympus OM series in the 1970's. Small is beautiful. Bravo, Canon; you will sell a lot of these!Note added in response to comments below:Thanks to everyone who commented but perhaps I did not make my viewpoint clear. Yes I know a knowledgable PhotoShop artist who spends time fiddling with an image may produce a better result than the in-camera JPEG. That's not the point. Post RAW processing is no longer optional since lenses are now designed assuming their distortions and aberrations will be corrected in software. Since the efficiency of the in-camera JPEG is part of the product and the mode most people will use, it should be part of the review. For any hobbyist who insists on doing it all by hand, be my guest, knock yourself out!Second, yes it is possible to get somewhat better, somewhat lower noise images at high ISO from a full frame sensor such as the D600. But in my tests this was only apparent if I crop to a small part of the original image. Normally the difference - in my judgement - is not great enough to make it worth lugging the big heavy D600.One more update: Consumer Reports just reviewed the SL1 and rated it near the top of DSLR overall", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Small but very capable", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1ZZD7G3SDXXYU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had several smaller cameras like the Canon G11. All had one fault that troubled me. They could not shoot quickly when a grand child photo op materialized.  Setting up for a particular shooting situation was far too time consuming, but more importantly, there was too much delay once the shutter was depressed. When shooting flash with red-eye protection turned on the delay is worse yet.  The SL1 is slowed a bit with red-eye on but not much and for all other shooting is as fast as other Canon DSLRs. Shots using available light are near instantaneous under normal lighting as is typical of Canon DSLRS and as is essential for shooting pets and grand kids. When shooting available light in low-light conditions the SL1 can take a second to focus but is still DSLR-quick, much quicker than lesser camera types.Another issue I have with smaller cameras is a secure and comfortable grip. While the SL1 is dimunitive by SLR standards, it still fills the hands comfortably and doesn't feel like it's going to slip through your fingers as a Digital Elph or an S100 or S110 does.  My right hand fingers do bottom against the front of the body (I'm tall with longish fingers) but not problematically so. The thumb rest on the back of the body is excellent; as good or better than any DSLR I've had before. The grip is great in spite of the small body and allows secure one-handed shooting. And, of course, the light weight means many shots before fatigue sets in.As with any small camera with a large sensor, physics prevents an equally compact lens though the 18-55 kit lens is surprisingly compact and light.  With the standard two-handed grip with the left hand underneath and the right hand up the right side, the zoom and focus rings are as easily accessed as on any larger dslr and lens and sure beat the rubbery electric zoom controls on more compact cameras.While the body is small, seemingly half the size of a 5D or 50D or 60D or 7D, the controls are pretty much as accessible as those on these larger cameras and far better than on an more compact camera. I wasn't excited about the touch screen, being adicted to the Canon Q screen, but it's a winner.  I use it more on every outing.  I thought smudges from use of the touch screen would be a problem but that has not been the case even with a protective film applied. The LCD is very bright. I've only had to set it to full brightness for use in ver y bright sunlight.If you are a Canon shooter now, you will be up to speed on this camera in an hour or two without ever cracking the manual (mine is still sealed). If you are new to DSLRs, the SL1 is probably as good a place to start as any.I won't get into a lot of the technical details since they are well covered by others. It seems to do at least as well as any APS-C camera I've had. Suffice it to say, feature-wise, the SL1 has just about everything you can get in the Rebel line except the weight and size and the flip-out LCD. For me it's the perfect second camera for backup, to carry on long hikes, for use at the grand kids birthday parties and soccer matches, and for casual walk-around duty. I'll rarely be without it.  My full frame DSLR will now be reserved for serious landscape and portrait shooting.UPDATE ...........It's been about two months now and I'm over 800 shots on the SL1.  I like it better every time I pick it up in part because it lifts up so easily!  I've now shot a five day vacation (one that did not justify taking the 5DIII) and a granddaughter's birthday party as well as a few family outings and some construction going on across the street.  And lots of experimenting in the back yard.  Here are my key findings:The dedicated ISO button is a blessing.  Because one runs into noise issues more often in a smaller sensor (compared to a full frame sensor in this case) keeping an eye on ISO is a good idea. Mostly I put ISO on auto and set it for a maximum of 3200 and shoot Av and the camera does a good job of balancing ISO and shooting speed, dropping below about 1/60 only when ISO would otherwise go above 3200. When a special situation arises such as when I have something to brace against the ISO button makes it very easy to force the ISO down for that shot.The Av +/- button is also handy.  It lets you easily adjust Aperture and/or compensation in the Quick menu, surely the two most frequently accessed adjustments.At ISO 3200 noise is hardly a problem for jpeg shooters.  RAW shooters used to a 5DII or 5DIII and using the SL1 as a \"backup\" or for less demanding outings may be shocked at the noise.  Even though it looms large compared to the full frame cameras, I don't think it's any worse than canon's other 18 MP bodies (60D, 7D, other Rebels). But, higher ISO images from the 5DII and 5DIII that did not require noise correction will typically require some color and luminance noise correction if taken with the SL1 (or any 18 MP Canon APS-C body).  There are APS-C cameras with lower noise but I think none that offer the benefits of the SL1 (especially at the new lower price!).The silent shooting mode is great.  It's quieter than the quiet mode in my 5DIII!.  It also slows the 4 frames per second burst mode down to an often more suitable 2-3 fps.  As with my 5DIII, I set the SL1 on silent mode early on and it's been on that setting since (I may go back to the 4 fps mode when the grand kids are old enough for sports).If I have an issue with the SL1, it's the zoom range of the kit lens.  I love the compactness of this lens and the always excellent Canon image stabilization.  However, at 18-55mm, it's plenty wide for casual use, but is a bit short on the tele end (88mm full frame equivalent).  At my grand daughter's birthday party I shot well over 20 images at the maximum 55mm setting. Almost every one needed to be cropped.  While this is a bit of a nuisance, the 18MP of the SL1 is sufficient to allow a lot of cropping so long as you are not printing beyond about 8x10. Also, unless you are an expert (I'm not), there is risk of zooming in too far and getting a less than ideal framing that you are stuck with.  When cropping down from a too large image, you always get a perfect framing of the subject(s) (and you can crop to 4x6 or 8x10).  Living with a maximum 88mm tele reach is thus not a bad thing.  The logical upgrade would be to an 18-135mm zoom (29-216mm) though such lenses are considerably larger and weigh about 16 oz, almost three times the six oz of the kit lens. The SL1 would not be nearly so handy with such a lens.I'm continuing to transition to the touch screen. I think I'll miss it when I next take the 5DIII out.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon SL1 Reviewed & Compared to the competition", "Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "R1C5C3U5FPQGG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon SL1 is a really small and light DSLR.  At just 13 ounces, the SL1 body is lighter than some point and shoot cameras (ie the Canon G15).  Even with the Kit 18-55mm STM lens attached, the SL1 is only 2 ounces heavier than the Canon G-1X and comparable to many compact system cameras. I do not believe there has been a SLR this amall/light since the Olympus E-4xx series (circa 2007 or so) This is obviously achieved by using a lot of plastic and rubber. But the camera does have a pretty solid feel.  I suspect that individuals with large hands may find the camera too small.Ultimately, it's  about the quality of the photographic images produced.  The SL1 truly excels in producing terrific looking photographs in all lighting conditions (An external Flash with bounce capabilities such as the 270EX is essential for indoor photography).  The photographs rendered are crisp and very well contrasted.  Noise is well controlled without too much detail loss through ISO 3200.  Even ISO 6400 is quite usable for small prints.  However, to my personal frustration, there are no incremental ISO settings between stops(ie ISO 2000) sometimes forcing the use of a higher than needed ISO setting.  Careful examination of some of the photographs (especially those with small text) shows some softness (even after software sharpening), but I suspect that's from the kit lens.  Shooting at a smaller aperture (i.e F8) does improve the sharpness somewhat.There is a definite improvement in the 'live view' (LCD framing) since my last Canon SLR (T2i).  However if you regularly prefer Live View to an optical viewfinder, the SONY SLT series or even a compact system camera (ie the Olympus PEN series) is a better choice.The Really Good: Terrific Image Quality under almost all conditions; Really small and light yet with almost all the features of larger/more expensive SLRs; Decent menu system; Bright/sharp LCD; Decent Live View for an SLR; The Automatic White Balance & Metering almost always gets it right.What can be improved: No Articulating LCD; No independent AutoFocus infrared beam (uses the flash which works much harder under dim lighting); Only 2 ISO stops between ISO 800 & ISO 6400 (1600 & 3200); Memory card on bottom sharing battery compartment (SD card can't be taken out while on a tripod); 18-55mm kit lens not that sharp; RAW editing software really bare bones.There really aren't too many choices for those that prefer a true DSLR (an optical viewfinder with a through the lens (mirror) view)as Canon and Nikon are really the only two camera manufacturers out there. Olympus has some excellent DSLRS but they haven't developed any new true DSLRs since the E-620 some years back; Panasonic and Fuji have gone exclusively \"mirrorless\" and it appears Sony is similarly not manufacturing anything new with an optical viewfinder.I am a big fan of the Nikon D40/D40X/D80/D90/D5000 etc cameras of a few years back.  I compared photographs taken of identical scenes with the D40x and the SL1 and the renditions were (eerily) almost identical.  The D40X was a little sharper (most probably the lens); the SL1 less noise at higher ISO sensitivity settings (about a full stop better).  Comparing the Nikon D3200 to the SL1, I prefer the SL1; less noise at higher ISO settings and nicer color rendition.  The Nikon D5200 (which unklike the SL1 has an articulating LCD) was a little harder to compare to the SL1. The colors are rendered so differently by each of these cameras.  The Nikon D5200 is much warmer with the Canon much crisper.  Both cameras delivered excellent High ISO results although the Nikon has incremental settings between stops allowing much more precise ISO settings.The .jpgs were much better on the Canon. You really need to shoot RAW with the Nikons.  Fortunately, Nikon's included Raw processing/editing software is pretty good improving the photos greatly.The AutoFocus on all of the Nikons were quicker than the SL1 in dim lighting although both the Canon and Nikons focused very accurately.  In total darkness, the Canon could not (auto)focus at all.  The Nikons relying on an infrared beam, (somewhat incredibly) focused effortlessly under such conditions.The Nikon raw editing software is much better (much more options) than the Canon software (If you shoot RAW with Canon, you really need Adobe).  Nikon's non-professional lenses are better than Canon's non professional lenses although many of Nikons older lenses are not compatible with the auto focusing system of many of Nikon's newer/lower end cameras.In comparing the SL1 with the Canon T2i/550D, an entry level DSLR from a few years back (which also uses the same 18MP sensor as does the current entry level model the 700D) the image quality is very similar, that is to say excellent.  Under artificial lighting (indoors), the photographs look almost identical at all ISO settings.  In Natural lighting (Outdoors) at base ISO, the photographs taken on each camera are also similar but I actually prefer the color rendition and light metering on the older T2i.  The SL1 body is about 25% lighter than the T2i body.  However, there is a downside to this svelte; larger/heavier lenses make the SL1 feel very unbalanced and uncomfortable to hold.  Consequently, an 'upgrade' from other recent Canon DSLRs for image quality purposes or else upgrading with the intention of using heavier lenses is not worthwhile.If you are seeking an affordable, small, true DSLR with an emphasis on image quality, The Canon SL1 should be near the very top of your list.  This is especially true for those that do not like using software to reprocess their photographs. An external bounce flash (ie 270EX) is a 'must'for proper exposure and color rendition indoors and to get the most out of this camera.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Have extra batteries on hand...", "Author": "ElmoTheCat", "ReviewID": "RPRPYH96UWYWX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got the EOS Rebel SL1 for its size and weight.

I mostly use the manual, shutter- and aperture priority modes. I can't comment on the pre-sets or video, never use them. There is plenty to like about the SL1 and lots to learn. The on-screen menu is helpful providing one reads the manual. However, what I did not like was having the battery die on me after a half day of shooting.

I had a T3i that I purchased a year ago, and I loved that camera.  When I saw the SL1 I was intrigued, so I ordered it.  Very happy with the SL1, gives up nothing to the T3 except that the LCD screen is fixed, not swiveling, but I didn't use the swivel feature anyway, and the SL1 adds a very capable touchscreen that really works.  I love the small size, paired with a smaller kit lens (I have the 18-55USM IS that came with the T3i, which is a bit smaller than the current STM lens they package these cameras with today) it is a VERY portable and light full featured DSLR. I also have the 15-85mm, 10-22mm and 55-250 canon zooms, all terrific lenses in their own right (particularly the 15-85, GREAT all around lens).  Those lenses add weight and bulk, but the smaller camera body size still helps, and you can always put the kit lens on when you want the light/compact camera to carry around.Image quality is superb, acceptable noise on images I shot the other night in a dimly lit coffee house @ 3200 ISO.Best camera I've owned.  I did a lot of research to see if I could justify an upgrade to a Canon 6D or 5D, but the price penalty (thousands for new camera bodies and lenses) and the weight and bulk penalty (considerable) didn't justify what I consider to be marginal improvements in image quality, at least for my needs, which are partly professional (I used this camera quite a bit for work) and for my own personal photography.So take the plunge, my guess is 90% of you will love this camera.

(Adorama)I was debating between the Rebel T3i, T5i, and this SL1... and had to see them in person to decide. We have a 5D Mark II and EOS lenses already, so this is more for our everyday and travel needs, and as a back up in case there's a problem with the bigger camera for teaching classes and such.While the quality of the picture supposedly isn't up to speed with the full-frame cameras, it's easily on par with any of the other Rebels or APS-C sensor cameras. So from there, it was really the size and the price of the camera that were the deciding factors for me.I spent a lot of time looking at the Amazon packages for these kits with the cheap extras... right now this SL1 w/ the Lens is $699. The other packages which include all of this along with a tripod, a camera bag, and lens filters (among other things), are going for as low as $559. The day I bought it the other package was $585.While I was checking out each of the Rebel cameras in the store, I had made up my mind and decided on the SL1. I pulled up the package from Amazon and showed them the ($585) price for the SL1, and they price-matched it. I feel like I got a steal!(They called up their buyer, who claimed the cheap package was an imported model with no Canon US Warranty... but the Amazon questions/answers section says it is a US camera with a US Warranty camera, with the original lens and battery... so they matched the price and gave me this kit. I highly recommend Adorama if you're in NYC and need something today. If you can wait, get the deal on Amazon with the extra freebies!)We have taken it out for a spin already to Central Park, and so far the results have been remarkably good. I'm a big fan of the EF-S 18-55mm IS STM Lens... it's quick, it's quiet, and the pictures came out great. We also tested it out with some of our older lenses, and didn't have any issues.Nobody serious is going to consider this a competitor to the 5D series, or other full frame cameras, but those are literally 4 to 5 times the price of this kit. And unless you REALLY like lifting your camera to take pictures over crowds, and need the moving screen, there's really nothing the T5i has that this doesn't. If you're looking for the next step down from full frame... basically for anything other than professional weddings, professional sports, or professional magazine photography... or if you're looking for an inexpensive or small and above-par backup, this camera is a GREAT choice. And as little more than a beginner myself, I can highly recommend this for those who want a DSLR to learn on.My favorite thing about the camera is the combination of the available buttons with the new touchscreen. It makes the learning much simpler, as the interface is much more intuitive.

I still have so much to learn on how to utilize all the functions!- Very friendly and intuitive interface. I've picked up other DSLR's and have found the menu and options to be quite intimidating. But I've been able to navigate around the menus on this camera very easily!- The camera display provides a lot of helpful tips and short explanations of what certain functions are (you can hide these tips in the menu option)- The touch screen is AWESOME. It doesn't seem prone to finger prints or scratches, which I find very appealing!SIZE/WEIGHT:I was really intrigued by the whole \"World's Smallest and Lightest DSLR\" claim (reminder: I'm a petite 5'1 female).- Holding this camera is VERY comfortable for me. The hand grip is perfect and my hand doesn't hang off the bottom of the camera. There's also enough room for MY fingers (I've read other reviews say it's too small for their hands so I emphasize 'my').- As an obsessive photo taker, I bring my camera with me EVERY where.. thus mobility is really important for me. This camera is incredibly light, and I've noticed an obvious difference when holding this camera to other Rebels or Nikon DSLRs. It's really easy for me to carry around; when I'm traveling or hiking I normally just keep it around my neck cause it's so light and convenient. I've held up my camera for long periods of time and I've never had an issue with feeling tired or my hands cramping.- The lens that comes with this camera is a good size.. but if you upgrade to a larger telephoto, the lens will definitely outweigh the camera body itself. It'll cause an uneven weight distribution and may become a little more uncomfortable to hold up with one hand.

New Nikon 18 to 55 mm lens shows the way forward with its collapsing lens barrel for carrying. I also do not like the plastic mount on the 18 to 55 mm kit lens since they wear and can be damaged easily. The optional 40 mm lens is a metal mount which is much more robust. Only and issue if you swap lenses frequently.2. The obvious compromise that some of the more esoteric settings are buried in menu items rather than as buttons for direct control but the touch screen mitigates some of those misgivings.3. Larger lenses make the camera unbalanced in the hand. No obvious way around this as this is a result of the small size.

The miniature tilt shift video mode is pretty cool too. The touch screen is also easy to use. Just poke the screen and it'll autofocus on that area.

In 2004 I purchased the original Rebel 300D, it was my first digital SLR.  I purchased it leaving my well loved film Minolta Maxxum 8000i behind.  Since that first original Rebel which I later gave to a friend, I have purchased three (3) additional Canon camera bodies in the last 3 years.  A Canon 40D, a Canon 7D, and my current pro body and first full-frame, the 5D Mark III.  Unfortunately magnesium alloy bodies can get very heavy and too big and noticeable for just casual shooting.  I wanted a smaller camera that I can have with me all the time but it seems like Sony has the best mirror-less camera as of the date of this writing (1/11/2014.  The Sony 7r would mean not only buying an expensive new body, but new lenses.  I'm to heavily invested in Canon L and prime lenses today.Along comes this little gem, the SL1 or 100D.  It is not mirror-less, and if you connect a large lens it loses its size advantage quickly but with a smaller lens, you essentially have a mini t5i that you can fit into a small backpack  and have with you all the time with very little  or no compromises.  Amazon's pricing during the 2013 Christmas holiday season made it even more irresistible -- a downright steal.  It has most of the features its bigger siblings in the Canon EOS lineup has with wonderful full-time hybrid CMOS autofocus during video mode shooting.  It has Multi-frame noise reduction, high resolution rear touch screen, shoots full HD 1080p at 30 fps, most of its intelligent and creative modes allow shooting in RAW, which If I remember correctly was not the case with earlier Rebel cameras; perfect for handing the camera off to friends and relatives to take a picture of you but yet still have some control over the exposure when you do, and have a high quality CR2 raw file for further editing in Photoshop later.  It has amazing low light capability, up to ISO 25600, 14-bit per channel with highlight controls.  This little camera can also serve as a second camera because its compatible with all Canon's EOS lenses.  It has some creative filters, although the miniature effect is the only one I like, especially in video mode.  Some of the special effects can be added later after the photograph has been taken and it will allow you to apply the effect on a copy, rather than the original photograph so you will have both the original photo and one with the special effect.  This little camera has built-in lens aberration correction and in camera cropping  just like its bigger brothers do and a programmable auto focus system like other Canon's do too. You can also program the asterisk button on the rear to detach auto focus from shutter release if you like this.  I have this setup on my Canon 5D Mark 3 and after getting use to it, find it more useful than having AF and Shutter on a single button.  It has a mirror lockup to reduce vibration with larger telephoto lenses.  It has four metering modes, evaluative, partial, spot  and center-weight metering modes.  Full data display with RGB or combined histograms,  Auto Lighting Optimizer, in camera HDR (3 frames) , touch screen LCD display that let you skip, zoom in or out with your fingers with familiar finger gestures like those used for iPhone and Android.What it does lack is a headphone jack for monitoring audio levels, the battery is small, so video recording time will not be as good as other Canon cameras, so have a charged up spare battery for recording video.  Lenses with IS switched on and using the built-in flash will kill the battery quickly.  But if you use a fast 50mm 1.8 or 1.4 or even the Canon 40mm f/2.8 STM lens, you should get the most battery life you can per charge.  I think this is probably the best camera deal for dSLR photography, especially if you can get it with instant cashback or rebates so shop around.Update  1/18/2014:Just thought I pass on this tip to other photographers.  The Opteka LP-E12 batteries make good additional batteries for the SL1.  They give you slightly more life and 1/4th the price of the original Canon battery.  Opteka LP-E12 2000mAh Ultra High Capacity Li-ion Battery Pack for Canon EOS-M & EOS Rebel SL1 DSLR Cameras  So if you shoot plenty of video, the Opteka battery seems to be a good choice, and at one fourth the price of the original Canon part, you can have four times the battery life.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "better than my last camera", "Author": "Daniel Treto \"dmtspaces\"", "ReviewID": "R1L48IZSTSJA9K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace an older Canon full-frame digital SLR that I have had for too many years...it was a very reliable camera but it was very heavy...I was looking at the T5i and T4i and even considered going to the 6D...This camera body came up on special for one day only for about $360 and I figured I would give it a test drive just to see if it would be worth it after reading some very positive reviews...after testing it out, I love this camera...maybe it doesn't have all the features of a T4i or even T5i but honestly, I don't really need those other features...It definitely has a lot more features than my last full-frame camera...First thing I wanted to test out was my old and trusty lenses...with the exception of one lens, they all worked without a hitch...I then wanted to test out some bokeh shots simply because it was Christmas...my shots were fantastic...took some family pics and found some really helpful, nifty features that make taking a family Xmas pic profoundly easy...my last camera could only do one pic at a time on a timer...I was taking 8 at a time with this one...it was very important because I have young kids and they move around a lot...it worked exactly as I needed it too...saved me so much time...so far, I am very happy with this purchase as it was low in price and is keeping me very happy...it has absolutely no problems working with high ISO's and the focus is really quick...I didn't want to buy it with the lens that comes with it but was very worried that it might not work with my lenses...my fears are put to rest...I feel like I could carry this camera around all day with no problem...the light body is truly an asset...I think the major point of this camera is that it is smaller and lighter than the other cameras and Canon is trying to use it to compete with the mirrorless systems that have come up (Canon makes one too)...I don't like the mirrorless systems myself and have been using a Canon G1X for a while now and I much prefer that camera to the mirrorless ones...but I did miss using my DSLR very much due to the versatility it offers...this suits me just fine...I am a hobbyist, not a professional and can not always afford full-frame DSLR's (even though they are much cheaper than my last DSLR!)...If you are a complete pro, this may not be the camera for you...but if you are like me, and are looking to upgrade from an old system, I would recommend this camera as it won't break the bank...you lose a little with the cropped sensor but if you know what you are doing, you will get accustomed to it very quickly...if you absolutely need those extreme wide-angle shots, you may need to spring for a full-frame...but if you just want to take family pics, sports pics, landscapes and macros, this will work just fine...by the way, this camera takes amazing pictures with prime lenses...Update:Still love the camera but it really lacks in taking pictures up close...so I use a 50mm prime (80mm equivalent) but I have to be about two feet away from my subject...so in order to get the picture I want, I have to use an 85mm lens...no big deal but not as functional as I wish it could be...there is a Macro setting on this camera but I haven't been able to use it effectively or efficiently with my smaller lenses...I am used to taking pictures within a foot if I want to...not a deal-breaker and it actually helps my creativity by making me think in a different manner but I still think it would be nice to have a closer range to shoot with...so if you are looking for macro, I wouldn't recommend this camera unless you are using an 85mm macro or higher...I think the distance to the lens elements from the sensor is a bit closer than in the slightly bigger cameras (T4i, T5i) and that is one of the trade-offs of making this one smaller...for the most part, this camera still rules but as I had said previously, if you are a pro, this may not be the camera you want anyway...I can't wait to take this to Washington D.C. later this year and snap to my hearts delight...", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sweet little camera, especially for the price.", "Author": "Ed", "ReviewID": "R1W0OQCGCSNHAQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Liked:- Touch screen, super easy to navigate menus and change settings on the fly- Touch section on screen to focus - just touch an area on the Live View screen to focus on that spot.

Other features lacking versus T5i: stereo microphone (SL1 is monaural) and some multi functionality of cross keys - IMO, small price to pay for lighter weight.

The camera and lenses are heavy to carry, though, so I have a variety of backpacks, bags, even a suitcase, depending on the length of the trip and how many lenses and stuff I wanted to carry. For some time now, I've been looking for something smaller and lighter - less weight and less space = more likely to carry the camera.  Most of the non-SLR cameras no longer have a viewfinder (something I use a lot) and many require you to buy a whole set of new lenses (e.g. the four-thirds and mirrorless systems) so I discarded both of those options. Maybe I should sell all my Canon gear and migrate to a smaller sized camera and lenses, but not yet. So the new Canon SL-1 was attractive to me. The body size is very small and light. My existing lenses work with it, and it has all the bells and whistles of a typical Canon SLR. Moreover, there are now three STM lenses that work specially with this camera body - the 18-55 mm kit lens, the pancake 40mm lens and the  18-135 mm lens. All are light-weight lenses. So I can carry a small over-the-shoulder bag with the SL-1, the three lenses, and maybe my EF 70-200 mm lens and an extender too! And for simple walk-around, just the camera and the kit lens is enough. I know it's not the same as my EF L quality lenses, but if that all sits at home because of the size and weight, what's the point?

The same sensor technology and advances has then been put into each successive camera, the T3i, the T4i, the 60D, etc., and finally, it has trickled down into the Eos SL1.Having used the 7D, the 60D, and the SL1, I can say the SL1's user friendliness and ease of use is up with the 7D, and indeed better than the 60D or the T2i (haven't used T4 or the new T5). Another strange thing about Canon, is they'll sometimes put really neat features into their lower end cameras to kind of see how they work out, as a test of sorts.The reason I say the SL1 is better than the 7D is the 7D had the digic 4 processor while this has the digic 5 processor. sensors being even identical, the better processor will enhance noise reduction in low light shooting, and the speed of the processor being 6 times faster adds to snappyness all around.The SL1 does indeed have a touch screen, and actually, it's very useable, close to using an iphone in touch sensitivity, and the beauty of Canon's design is, you can turn it OFF, and you can navigate all the menus without using it at all either, which is something very important to me. I don't want my nose hitting the screen to suddenly change a setting while looking through the viewfinder, or maybe i want to save that extra bit of battery life, etc.it is indeed small, and my only real beef with the SL1 is that while the whole point of it is it being small and portable as all heck, my hand wants just a little bit more depth in the grip itself. otherwise, a perfect little camera. I'm sure some third party vendor is going to come out with an extension grip, or one of those hand strap accessories to remedy this.I wear glasses, and this viewfinder will be smaller than a 5DmkIII or 7D, and again don't like my nose smashing on the screen, so, I HIGHLY recommend the EP-EX15II extender for the viewfinder. Just look it up on amazon. it makes using the viewfinder infinitely more useable, and it's a very inexpensive accessory.That being said, I think Canon has a winner on their hands. I will take the SL1 + 40mm pancake combo over the FujiX100S or even Canon's G1X, or any other compact, 4/3's, or other 'lightweight' body camera. This is the one to beat!people complain about the 'only one cross-type' sensor, but I've found the autofocus points to be speedy and smart and accurate. The only time this should even be an issue is when holding the camera vertical/portrait mode, but what I tend to do is half-press to focus the center point where I want focus, and then compose the shot with button still pressed, then push all the way to take the shot. even with 20 cross-type focus sensors, you're better off just using the center to get focus anyways. At least, that's how I shoot.One other caveat is you should get at least one STM lens for this body. The kit lens is probably good, I didn't get it, the 40mm STM is a beautiful lens, perfect wide open, so at least get one STM lens, so you can appreciate the very fast focus speed and better autofocus during video shooting.

Like most people who enter the world of DSLR I was looking for better pictures of my kid and vacation pictures. Not trying to be a pro. Before this, I was using a Canon S95 point and shoot which is a decent point and shoot but I disliked the noise and general fuzziness I would get in the wrong light.SL1 pros: Small (ish) for a DSL, but with a good hand grip for me (husband says its too shallow for his hands). Lots of auto features (\"scene\" modes and creative auto) as well as features for more advance users (Aperture priority, full manual). With the kit lens (18-55) the pictures come out OK and sharp and the kit lens is good for video since the camera can record video and the kit lens has quiet autofocus that doesn't record in the video. But the zoom ring is a bit stiff and using it for the first time in a video it was a bit jerky. The aperture isn't that great on the kit lens, so I hardly use it anymore. (I like my nifty fifty most of the time).Image quality: very good. I've gotten a lot of compliments on my photos taken with this camera and with good light, I get very good photos. Images are sharp and although I edit them, for the most part, the colors are excellent. The kit lens has image stabilization (which I need!) but the body doesn't have any so when I combine my prime lenses (50mm 1.8 nifty fifty and 85mm 1.8 portrait lens) I can get slightly out of focus images because I think I have a slight wobble. Sucks. It's technique mostly.Noise above 6400 is a bit too much for my taste so I restricted it in the menu options. Wish it had built in lever guides (come on Canon!) and the more advance features coming to entry level mirror less cameras (Olympus, Panasonic).Overall design is nice and the touch screen can be used for touching the setting you want to change and then using the dial to alter it (such as aperture, or white balance). The touch screen doesn't swivel or tilt (it's fixed) but I like how you can touch to autofocus and take a picture right after (I used this to get kids interested in taking photos (since its easier than viewing in the viewfinder and pressing a shutter). Shooting in live mode with the LCD screen the autofocus is undoubtedly slower. But I fixed it onto a tripod and shot in live mode with a basic shutter cable and my images are tack sharp. I was taking pictures of kids posing for a new yearbook photo.No wi fi which is strange since it came out only last year.Can be used with most EF and EF-S lenses (I only own 4 including 2 kit lenses) and I've used it on a tripod with great success with a remote shutter (not super great) and the corded shutter with extension (much better!).I've taken this traveling to Europe and with the 4 lenses and hot shoe flash, I have to carry a large carry-on bag onto the airplane cabin since its just too much stuff and I would never pack a camera inside a suitcase. I suppose it would be a good addition for someone who has a larger Canon DSLR body and just wants a more portable version to go with their gear.I'd say this camera is great for beginners (like myself) to intermediate at the best.

She was ready to make the jump from her Canon Powershot to a DSLR but was put off by the size, weight, and apparent complexity (not so, but that's a conversation for a different time and place) of my 40D and 60D.I won't go into all the features and functions, or the benefits of a DSLR over a P&S.;  These are adequately covered in the product description and by other reviewers.  I'll just say this camera is of the same high quality design and build that experienced Canon shooters have come to expect.A few general observations:The 18-55mm STM kit lens is excellent (maybe the best in it's class), with a good zoom range for general scenics and casual portraits.  If the kit lens is the only one you have, it might be worth paying more for the 18-135mm for the extra reach.  It works fine with the lenses, including a couple of L models, I use on my XXDs.  But they're quite a bit larger and heavier than the kits and detract somewhat from size and weight benefit of this camera.Get a lens hood.I have my XXDs configured for back button focusing.  Can't do that with this one.  I'm left eye dominant and the back buttons are too close to my face.  It's awkward.The battery is probably the weakest aspect of this camera.  In order to keep the weight low, Cannon uses a smaller lower capacity battery.  Because of the way we shoot we can easily get though several days of casual shooting on a single charge.  But if you're always checking your shots, shoot in bursts, often use the built in flash, or use live view, you'll want a backup battery.  Maybe two if you shoot much video.  We bought a low cost third party battery that seems to work just fine.The video function seems to work OK.  I'm not a videographer and have no interest in becoming one.  I doubt that I'll use this function much, if at all.  I had a colleague, who is an accomplished videographer, look at this feature.  His assessment is that it works well, but one who shoots a lot of video should buy a dedicated video camera.  Says he wouldn't recommend it to record the only video of an important event like a graduation or wedding.This is an excellent choice for someone who's just getting into DSLR photography, or an experienced photographer who wants a second high quality body without breaking the bank.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "sdrizzle", "ReviewID": "R2WCHFFX8EHY9J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Light, compact and very easy to use .

Clearly, times have changed.  I've used several high-end DSLRs, and more recently a point-and-shoot that has way more things than I know how to control -- but I could carry it, even though I didn't particularly like it.  Meant I could still take \"pics\" if not photos.  Perhaps I am odd, going from a recent Canon DSLR to its newest Rebel. But, it had become so that I couldn't use the massive camera and keep it steady -- and I had the choice to carry it or the tripod -- not a good photo mix having to choose between the two.  So, first... No, the Rebel SL1 doesn't take the same kind of pics as the bigger DSLR-- but it **does** take photos as opposed to pics, and I can carry it -- and the tripod.  And for me, that matters.  The photos are good, (not award winning -- yet).  Their resolution is fine; little tweaks in Photoshop can make them better.  But the best?  I can carry the bloody thing (and the tripod); interchange lightweight lenses; and feel happy at the end of the day. If you're a photo-pro, this might be an OK walk-around-with camera that does more than point-and-shoot.  If you want more than that, it likely won't satisfy you. However, if you are a photo hobbyist that likes being able to take really good photos easily, and can't carry the weight of a full-size DSLR (crap... getting older and less-abled is really unpleasant), you might just find this is the camera you're looking for.(Edit:)  Changed to 5 stars when not using kit lens.

It's small size and lightweight body makes it easier to grip especially for those who have smaller hands. I tote this camera around because it's light weight and it still brings a excellent quality photo. It's one of my favorite Canon cameras to use, mainly because of the smaller size of the body of the camera. However the lens is a standard size, but it's nothing to worry about as the lens that comes with the kit isn't too heavy anyways. Compared to Canon's other cameras I did noticed the difference in resolution of the picture between the larger cameras than the SL1's but this is nothing to send you away from this camera but this comes with the size of the camera and lens.

Buttons for quick functions are well placed and easy to use. I absolutely love the touch screen display. But in truth, I rarely use \"live view\" for taking pictures. The viewfinder is not 100% of what the lens sees, but it is so easy to use, and easy to find your subject, unlike the point and shoot I used before. What is really amazing about this camera is the auto focus (AF). It is 9 point, but I find mostly I use the \"spot\" focus. The pictures that I am able to get amaze me. How the camera can focus as quickly as it does is something. I find myself now using \"M\" more and more to adjust the shutter speed and aperture for detailed and fast moving subjects. I have been able to take pictures of birds in flight, near and far that are in focus and with great detail. Although I may someday upgrade to a midrange DSLR, this camera will have given me all the \"lessons\" I need to be able to handle the additional features that midrange DSLR's have.

If you've got larger than average-size hands (or maybe even average size hands), it may be a little uncomfortable to hold it.  The hand grip doesn't go very deep, so larger fingers have no comfortable place to go.  My hands are pretty normally sized, if not slightly smaller than normal, and I found the camera to be just a bit uncomfortable to hold for long periods of time.  Certainly not because of the weight.  But because I never could get my hands into a position that really fit properly.  The grip just isn't quite big enough to be the right fit.  I may be spoiled because normally I shoot with a Canon 6D or 70D, which fit my hands very well, but the SL1 never feels quite right.But for someone with small hands, or someone who is looking for a tiny SLR, the SL1 is great.

Really good. So good that I kept using the camera for years. But although the new Rebel (EOS 100D) is good and the image quality is brilliant, i'm not sold on the auto-focus, and by extension the auto-exposure. Maybe it's me and maybe i have a setting wrong, but the focus is a bit random and seems to shift ever so slightly when you're supposedly locked onto an image - and then the auto-exposure mucks up because the focus is out. Like I say, maybe it's me, but i never had this issue with the original Rebel. The old Rebel i took all around the world and took tens of thousands of photos and i never had this issue. But let's put this issue aside. The camera is light. I mean really light. This is good and bad. Good that it doesn't put a strain on your hand, but bad in that i like a bit of weight to the body to get crisp shots - and maybe this is the nub of earlier issue. I like all the features the camera comes with, although the in-camera filters are a bit of a waste, and i don't really use them. I'd rather have a solid perfect original that i can manipulate later in post, rather than having the original modified in-camera - leaving no opportunity for later tuning. Do watch the battery, as it will drain pretty quickly if you take a lot of photos, but if you're like me you'll always carry spare batteries (i always carry 3 spares). And to that point, the battery charger is damn quick. So if you do run out of power, it's not a long wait - a couple of hours. But you should always carry spares anyway, so the point is moot. I've also taken to using an Eye-Fi SD card. This is a little SD card that has built in wifi, and is compatible with this camera. So when my camera comes in range of my wifi (either at home, my iPad, or phone) the Eye-Fi card starts to upload the images. A real saver in time and I now wonder how I ever survived before by manually transferring images.

I have been photographing with it frequently for about a month now.A famous photographer says \"your camera doesn't matter\" - and it's rings true - if you have the SL-1.Yes, you can take great pictures with almost any camera, even the simplest point and shoot (P&S;), but the SL-1, and probably other leading brands DSLRs, give the photographer an edge I experienced firsthand.So, what is this edge?If I'd have to sum it up in one word, it would be \"technology\"; it encapsulates everything that is so super about this camera.The DSLR state of the art technology advantages:- Better handling and responding to the varying stages of light anywhere that result in providing fantastic pictures.- Faster tracking, focusing and shooting moving subjects of all kinds. If you are a first time DSLR buyer you'd be amazed at the easiness in which the camera does it and then you'll probably ask yourself: \"why haven't I upgraded earlier?\"- Having a real viewfinder. Most amateur Digital-era point and shooters don't really understand the necessity of a relatively small viewfinder, when photographic subjects can be seen on a big LCD screen (aka \"live-view\").Ever since I got the SL-1 I don't use the live-view anymore.Why? Because of the now-obvious advantages:* Immediate response to photographing possibilities.* Far less energy consumption compared to live-view which allows taking many more pictures between each battery charge.* Framing and composing tend to be better. This is debatable, but I think that is is so because the eye is isolated from nuisances and distractions, and is closer to the frame and final composition.- The ability to change lenses. You can do just fine with just one kind of lens, but being able to change lenses, reach out further or closer than ever possible otherwise and achieve top-quality results is exciting and liberating.The SL-1 is good-looking, easy to handle and operate, its build quality and responsive touch screen are top notch.I see only one disadvantage compared to a P&S;: it is relatively bigger - but remember that this camera offers the smallest DSLR package available today in a bargain price.I have been an amateur photographer for more than 10 years, taking pictures with P&S; cameras. Ever since I purchased this camera I feel like a pro. I just can't stop taking pictures, and the results are way beyond my expectations.

We purchased this kit for only $499 a few months ago and so far it's been lovely to use. It fits my wife's hands perfectly and it's not so small that I'm not comfortable using it either. The kit lens is great but a bit limiting at just 55mm on the long end. If you plan on getting the longer zoom to supplement it, fine. But if you want to not have to switch lenses often and want more reach, I highly recommend getting just the body (for under $400) and then getting the Canon EF-S 18-135 STM for about $400 more.

The real decision one has to make is which frame sizes to buy. I  have a full frame Canon 5DMKlll. This will use all of the Canon EF,lenses,is big,expensive,heavy and good.I also had a Canon 7D. It has the a so-called 1.6 sensor  is smaller than the full frame sensor,such that the picture will be cropped down. For example a 50mm full frame lens would give you a picture size the same as an 80mm full frame lens. 50mm times 1.6 = 80mm. This camera will use Canon EF lenses and Canon EF-S (S for small) lenses. EF-S lenses can't be used on full frame cameras. The 7D will use those S lenses and the EF lenses but weighs about as much as the  full frame 5D. Enter,the SL-1, the perfect solution. I was able to sell my 7D body ( which has its own merits,especially for pros and movie makers) and more than pay for a new SL-1 body! Now I can use  those EF -S lenses plus my other Canon lenses on a great lightweight platform.For the  new camera buyer without a lot Canon lenses,one must consider other options. For a good all around camera the  Canon EF Ti5 with the swing out screen would be better but I wanted the lightest most compact unit.Also to consider are the newer micro four thirds cameras.Their  sensor screens are one half the size of a full frame camera sensors and are capable of amazing performance. For all intents they are as good as cameras with 1.6 sensors. Both Olympus and Panasonic have excellent models which can take stunning photographs. The big advantage is that not only the camera bodies but the lenses and lighter. There is a different learning curve for using them. You have no option buy to learn to set the camera ,since there are so many complicated buttons and menu's you are always accidentally resetting the cameras to a different setting. Once you learn how to control them they are tremendous performers that come in a small light format. The Canon cameras will always be heavy due to the lenses.  I now actively use both my Canon cameras and my Olympus and Panasonic cameras. My most economical recommendation is the Olympus EPL-5, a pocket full of the little prime lenses (14MM,20MM 45mm) for some amazing pictures. One benefit of micro four thirds is that all brands are interchangeable.

It is compatible with Ultra High Speed cards. The camera body weights 13 ounces. The camera has HDR, filters, picture styles and more. The battery does not last a real long time. It depends on how much you use the touch screen and video. Video will kill the battery fast.It has an internal mono microphone but an external port for a stereo microphone. The internal microphone is of no use, so plan on getting an external one or some other method of recording sound. It will shoot at 4 frames a second. I was not happy that the battery compartment and the memory card are the same.  The camera would last longer if the battery was different that the card. That was my thought's anyway. I was not happy that the cover for the port that USB to go to the PC is just a piece of rubber.It would be better to use a card reader. I did not have a card reader though. I do not expect it to last a long time. I do have a point and shoot that is like that that has lasted for many years but I have been very careful. I liked the weight and the ISO the most of the camera. I do not like the 18-55 lens. It does not give me enough distance. I would have preferred the 18-135 lens.

Let me use my usual disclaimer, and admit that with so many good cameras around, it is more about what mix of traits or features you are looking for.On that note, the camera's trait mix is as follows. It is a DSLR with 18 megapixels resolution. Probably the most important point for this class of cameras is the sensor size, which is APS-C. That's just one step below 35mm Full frame.It has an optical viewfinder, which works through a pentaprism. That is the classical SLR construction. You are using the properties of light to view the subject before and during the shot. The purists would argue this is the way it was supposed to be- that is, with minimal electronic intervention. As in most Canon DSLRs, it has a Dioptric adjustment to make it easy for people with glasses to use the viewfinder. Also, you can preview depth of field. The dust deletion mechanism includes a software adjustment for removing/modifying the affected pixels, self-cleaning sensor, and manual cleaning.The ISO rating is 25,600 which makes it work better in low light. The video is a Full HD- that is 1920x1080 resolution. The camera gives you the option to control the exposure  manually. It does have an external flash option. You would need that for portraits, at least. The LCD screen resolution is a whopping 1,040,000. The sustainable burst rate- for fast action- is 4 frames per second. That is a bit low for DSLRs. The camera also does RAW processing which is useful if you did not want to be limited by JPEG storage only. The camera body weighs 407 grams, which is very light compared to other DSLRs. In that respect, the SL1 gives users the best of both worlds- SLR characteristics with light weight. That holds up well against the newer challenger of this category of cameras- the mirrorless.The SL1 has a couple of small, but significant changes over the T3i. It has a higher ISO rating, and a much improver LCD screen. Most importantly, it has a newer image processor- Digic 5 instead of Digic 4.A nice camera, and a lot improved compared to its predecessor. But still somewhat dated when it comes to some traits, compared to other DSLRs.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great smallest DSLR", "Author": "J.

I have been doing a lot of research on 7D & D60. They're both great cameras and prices for both have gone down dramatically! I have been a CANON enthusiast. And so when this DSLR came into existence, I quickly bought it. I consider myself as a beginner even though I have using DSLR for years. So when I got this camera, I take a lot of shots. The pictures I got was great and very fast. I am not very sure about taking the videos. However this camera has default settings which would be good to choose during certain circumstances. I think this camera would be good for travelling because of its small size & I think my wife would like it. She doesn't like huge dslr because they're heavy. But the capabilities of this small light camera are a good match for D7 & D60.

Simply can't hold it steady anymore due to arthritis and you can't always use a tripod, which I hate anyway.I have been reading reviews since before and after my purchase.  With the exception of one review (not on this site), no one has mentioned the noise. This is astounding to me as I find it unacceptable.  Shooting at the highest resolution (RAW) produces a document file size of approximately 11.5\" x 17.5\" with the maximum resolution of 5184 x 3456 pixels (somewhat incongruous).  Even without cropping, which I most always do, the noise is unbearable and makes it almost impossible to obtain a \"tack sharp\" image. I know that I shouldn't compare my 5D MKII to this camera, but same images taken by both cameras, same settings, and same lighting conditions produced a vastly different quality.  Even if 11 x 17 would be my largest print size, and it isn't, I would not be happy with it.  Noise reduction, whether in the camera or with software, always softens the image.I wanted to love this camera because of its weight (and I do love the touch screen).  I may contact Canon.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong with my camera settings.  I really hope I'm doing something wrong.Has anyone else had the same experience or have any suggestions?", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great little camera!", "Author": "G. Morris", "ReviewID": "R2I93W3JPSJ240", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to use with one single Canon lens I have; the new 35mm IS lens.  This DSLR body and that lens make a near perfect match.  This body is a little bit small for my hand and grip but surprisingly when the 35mm IS lens is mounted to this body (and the lens is nearly as large as this camera body) it creates a very easily hand-holdable pair.This Canon body has all the buttons and settings one needs for basic shooting and also basic video shooting.  The video capability mostly keeps up with my 18-month old granddaughter as she zips around and that's a significant plus for this camera and it's auto-focusing ability.The reason I knocked this camera body down from five-stars to four-stars is that the image quality is not as good as I'd have expected.  Specifically, the images suffer from a bit more noise than they should have.  I do most of my shooting at ISO 200 to ISO 400.  When the images are viewed in Photoshop at 100%, it's clear that a healthy dose of noise reduction needs to be applied.  The camera does produce decent image detail and contrast but Canon's 18MP sensors (at least in this camera and the 7D which I previously owned) just fall a little short of what the lenses are capable of putting on the sensor.Overall, this is a very good camera and if one is not as image-quality obsessed as I tend to be and you don't put any giant lenses on this very small body (such as the 100-400 push pull L zoom lens), then you'll probably be 5-star happy.  With smallish lenses, I do recommend this Canon camera body.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love the size,", "Author": "Mauricio", "ReviewID": "R2ZCPY15Z8J9MM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wonderful DSLR.

I have a couple point and shoots, and another Rebel that is old.  What attracted me to it was the small size; I loved that.  I bought it with the 250mm IS zoom lens.It is indeed small and very lightweight.  There is most definitely a difference in the heaviness of it compared to my friend's big Canon SLR.  In trying it out, I used both lenses.  Even with the zoom on it, it is still very light and easily to manage. That much, I liked about it.I also LOVED the touch screen.  When I bought it, the guy told me it had touch screen.  I figured I would never use that.  But, I tried it and really liked it - it makes it very convenient to change settings.  And, once you go back to shooting, the touch screen is disengaged - in otherwords, if you bump the camera on your side while walking, the touch screen does not activate.  Good feature.I am by no means a professional photographer.  But, I know my way around a camera.  I don't like all the fancy settings.  I use P or manual, and sometimes landscape.  I prefer to monitor my aperature and shutter speed rather than letting the camera do it all automatically.  I have no use for any kind of video, so I didn't even use the video on this camera, not even to try it.I did try out the different settings just to see how they were.Overall, it takes decent photographs.  But, my problem with it was the closeups.  I could NOT get a decent closeup of things like the centers of flowers, or a bird's eye.  If I was taking a photo of some scenery around a lake, or a blue sky, the photos were good.  I don't like using the \"closeup\" setting because you cannot adjust the focus point (if you want the focus only in the center, you can't use the closeup setting - or if you can, I could NOT find a way to do it).  My other Rebel had this same issue so I would never use the closeup setting.  When you focos on something in the closeup setting, it will not necessarily put the focus point on what you want.  I hope I am explaining that properly.  But, the P setting, you can put the focus in the center, and it stays there.I shot some photos in our national park, and at a state park.  I took photos of birds, landscapes, trees, etc.  I just was not blown away by the photographs.I bought the camera to replace my Canon Rebel XS which I bought in 2009 but have dropped too many times.  That old camera takes better photos than this little one. And, unfortunately, what attracted me to the camera - the light weight and small size - ended up being something I don't like.  Because it is so light, sometimes it's hard to steady - if that makes sense.Maybe a professional using the numerous settings might like this camera, but I didn't.  If it would maybe be $150.00, I would have kept it - but, it was too expensive for me not to love it.

Sometimes I wished I had come across a review on a product somebody thought about but ultimately passed over for something else.  Gotta look at all the angles.  I picked up the SL1 and just didn't like it's light-weightiness.  If I'm slapping down $650+ on an electronic device I don't want less substantial build, body, chassis, design and heft.
