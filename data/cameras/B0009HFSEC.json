It has proven itself to be dependable, takes great pics, and has a very good battery life. I am puzzled by the above review. It's a wonderful little camera.", "Date": "December 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "Satisfied", "Author": "Nicole Rhodes \"Nick-E\"", "ReviewID": "RAJ67OEJ138YT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay so I am not a photographer I just wanted a simple camera to take simple pics of my beautiful son & that's what I got & the color is great on the pics.  As far as it being complicated I don't think so.  However, it does read low battery often even if the battery is not low.  Just turn it off & back on then it's fine.  Even the editing software is great.  Plus I only paid $85.00 for mine.  Great Buy!", "Date": "February 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "awesome!!!", "Author": "Travis McMinn \"Travis\"", "ReviewID": "RJASFKF4RN5Q1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best camera in its class! the best quality you can find for only 150$ I am very pleased with this camera. please don't listen to anything anybody else says about this camera!

It drains batteries so fast one cannot even turn on the camera to take photos without replacing with new ones and even then, one keeps getting false readings of \"low battery\" even though I have a battery checker to make sure they are in full power. It has been more than three months since this camera was purchased and neither the store nor the company will entertain a replacement. Am I upset......you betya!", "Date": "September 12, 2005"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0009HFSEC"}}
