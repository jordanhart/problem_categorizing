I purchased the program and cameras with the belief if something happened I could get assistance in correcting it.  I have not been able to get any assistance from anyone on this product.  When I load the program, it changes my screen resolution and I can no longer access my tast bar.  This has really been a disapointment.  Amazon required me select at least one start but it is not even that.  Starting to feel like money wasted.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great system, easy to set up", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R2C1QEFIL83FDE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this system to catch some local vandals. Given the price I paid for this system I wasn't expecting much. I was happily surprised with the ease of setup and the quality. The video quality is more than adequate for my needs. Setup was straight-forward and the included instructions were easy enough to follow. I had the whole thing up and running in a couple of hours. Cameras work well both in the day and night. DEFINITELY worth the money as the color vision is great. Highly recommend.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$599.99", "Features": "Multi-channel playback, searching by time/date and recording events, images can be zoom/capture/save/print/backup\nMulti alarm triggering method: sensor, motion, video loss, and HDD space shortage\nMaximum display/recording rate is 30 fps\nFast MPEG4 video compression.
