{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Kodak EasyShare V603 is the best ultra-compact camera right now", "Author": "C. Bhairo", "ReviewID": "R1CNHY5B2FVHMG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Kodak EasyShare V603 is a great camera. It is an underdog in the digital camera world. Many digital camera websites on the internet have a bias that Canon and Nikon are superior cameras, while Kodaks are considered inferior ----- but V603 proves that this is not true. The V603 is very small, takes great pictures with excellent exposure, and is built better than any ultra-compact Canon and Nikon has to offer. In my review, I'll try to mention aspects that other reviews haven't covered as yet.Pros:1) Instant picture taking. The V603 focuses really fast and takes a picture in less than a second. It doesn't matter if you pre-focus by pressing the shutter button halfway --- it's still fast. Canon Elph cameras (even with their \"super fast\" Digic II processor) aren't as instant because their mechanical auto-focusing takes a while to lock on focus. The Schneider-Kreuznach lens (German engineered) on the V603 is high quality, giving you sharp photographs and fast focusing.2) Great, bright 2.5\" LCD screen. It has 230,000 pixels of resolution, a lot more than its competitors. Basically, when you take pictures and view them, they will look very sharp, and life-like. If you check the specifications for other similar cameras made by Canon and Nikon, they tend to have around 130,000 pixels of resolution, often giving pictures a grainy appearance. There is only one flaw to this LCD screen, which I'll mention later on.2) No red eye pictures. The manual mentions a hidden feature the V603 has ------- it actively scans eyes in the photographs you take, and automatically removes red-eye. (Page 9 + 33 in the manual) The camera also let's you set the flash to flash twice in order to remove more red-eye in pictures, but it is redundant since the post-processing in the camera automatically removes red-eye.3) The battery life is good. Ultracompacts are known to have poor battery life, but on average, the V603 gives me about a whole day's worth of picture taking, video taking and picture reviewing. By the time I got home, it finally gave me a low battery warning. The low battery warning is great ------ the camera let's you take pictures for half an hour more before finally shutting off. Canon Elph cameras barely give you 5 minutes before shutting off on you. The V603 at least gives you the opportunity to finish up taking photographs.4) Amazing panaramic feature. It's easy, you take 3 photographs, and the camera automatically stiches it inside of the camera! What's really amazing is that there is no overlap whatsoever ---- it combines into one seamless picture. Cameras from other name brands don't even do this. It can also enhances pictures, and crop inside of the camera. This is great if you are the type of person who likes printing directly from your camera to your printer, for you do not need a computer to enhance your pictures.Cons:1) The LCD smudges way too easily with fingerprints. It is not a problem when you're actually using the V603, because when the LCD is lit, you do not see the dust and fingerprints which accumulate on it. You will only see it when you turn off the camera. Honestly, it'll only affect you if you want to show off your V603 to other people, but it does not affect the operation of the camera in any way. Wiping it off with a cloth will be a necessity every now and then.2) Quicktime video format. The V603 takes videos in Apple's proprietary format, which Windows Media Player does not natively understand. Keep that in mind if you have a PC. If you want to burn your videos on DVD, (since V603 takes TV quality video) you have to make sure your DVD video editing program handles Quicktime's .MOV files.3) Some of the camera's features requires the Kodak software. I'm especially referring to the Favorites feature, where you can keep a portable photo album of 150 pictures in the cameras internal memory ------ yet, if you use a program other than Kodak's Easyshare to transfer your photographs, there's no way to make use of this Favorites feature at all. This is important to point out because not everyone likes the Kodak software ---- I think Google's Picasa is better at organizing photographs in your computer, but it cannot access the camera's Favorite mode.Improvements from the older V550 model: The older model of this camera is the V550. This V603 has better buttons which are easier to press, the viewfinder was completely eliminated, is more battery efficient (perhaps due to improvements in internal circuitry or powersaving software), 6 megapixels vs 5 megapixels, and it doesn't with the photo frame stand which let's you sync and charge by dropping it in. Instead, the V603 comes with USB sync and an AC adapter wire to charge the camera. This is better for traveling as you don't have to take the big photo frame dock with you everywhere you go.Other notes: Although it seems the V603 is meant for amateurs, there are features that photographers using SLRs would appreciate. The V603 does have a shutter priority mode, letting you keep the shutter open for up to 8 seconds, while the camera controls the aperture and other settings. It has the ability to show you a live histogram, letting you analyze a picture in real time to see if the camera will take a good exposure or not. It has a framing grid to help you frame your shot too. Last but not least, V603 also has an interesting blur warning system which rates every picture you take using a hand sign and color, letting you know if it's a good sharp picture or not. The scene modes help you adjust manual settings too. (For instance, selecting the Panning Shot mode allows the V603 to select an aperture setting which allows the background to blur, while keeping the foreground sharp and focused)Overall ----- it is a great camera. People on the internet have a bias that Canon and Nikon are good cameras. The truth is that perhaps their $1000 SLRs are great, but their reputations shouldn't be rubbed off on cheaper point and shoot cameras. For point and shoot cameras, Kodak V603 outperforms any Canon Elph, Nikon or Casio camera you can use. The proof is in the great pictures, and the fast operation of the camera, which is easy and intuitive.", "Date": "September 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Outstanding, easy, fast, sleek little camera with GREAT pics!", "Author": "Brian D. Kozola", "ReviewID": "R1ZO576KJ5E580", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the third camera that I have tried out for my main family snapshots.  This is an outstanding blend of style and performance and it is small enough to easily fit into your pocket.  I was looking for good picture quality with a fast shutter/auto focus speed and this camera fits the bill.  In addition, it shoots high quality (TV quality) video compressed in MPEG-4 meaning you can store 30 min of video on 1 GB of memory.  This camera is truly a pocketable still and video shooter ready to capture anything you throw its way.  I have tried the camera in many different lightings and it has performed very well with outstanding pictures all around.  I would highly recommend this picture for anyone that wants good quality and fast performance in a small package.On camera picture editing is OUTSTANDING where you can apply Kodak Perfect Touch processing to improve lighting and then crop the photos before you even take the pictures off the camera.  The improvement from initial to quality print is amazingly easy with the camera editing. In addition, you can instantly see if the camera was still enough for a good picture or if it was shaky and time to try another shot.  With this camera you can truly take all quality images.Innovative design features!  No more flimsy little plastic doors to access your memory card and charge your battery.  The battery is charged by plugging a power cable directly into the side of the camera.  Also, the memory card fits into a slot on the side of the camera for easy removal, but is very secure and will not accidently fall out.  It is incredible nice not having to worry about carefully opening and closing plastic slide doors every time you want to download pictures or charge the battery!The other cameras I tried included the Casio Z60 which is a great little camera, very fast, but shoots marginal quality pictures.  I also tried the Sony W50 long enough to find the shutter/Autofocus lag totally unacceptable for pictures of my kids in motion.  The Kodak beats both of these cameras hands-down.", "Date": "August 14, 2006"}, {"Title": "Does well what it does.", "Author": "H.

I liked it's small size, brilliant LCD, and overall metal body. However, it uses too small battery that always make me nervous about the juice. (The camera won't show you the charge level unless it's almost gone) Also, V603 doesn't have any fancy mechanism like vibration reduction.However, I'm very happy with it's software side, I mean, the operational software that's inside the camera.It has a nice panorama stitching function, which lets you combine up to 3 pictures. Creates a very sharp and seamless panorama that was better than any similar software I've seen that runs on the computer. Another fun widget is called Perfect Touch, which compensates underexposures typical to a flash indoors shot. Of course you can do the similar thing in Photoshop, but hey, it's just more handier.I recommend V603 for its low price, nice looks, and some of those fun and easy functions.", "Date": "May 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "A great camera both indoors and out", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R1Q2YRJ34AFHE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first day I got my new v603 I used it to take a bunch of pictures of my new apartment to send to family and friends.  I was impressed with the indoor shots, and the flash worked well when needed.  Yesterday I used the camera extensively at an air show, and got amazing pictures and movies of the planes both in the air and on the ground.  I could not be any happier with my choice, so  check it out if youre looking to spend about $250 on a pocket camera that is packed with useful features.  I cant believe how far these cameras have come in the few years since I bought my last camera!  It is so easy to use, and though the buttons are smaller than on previous generations of cameras, they are easy enough to use and fit the compact design of the camera.

Dodge", "ReviewID": "R7K1DUCHMQ42D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received the Kodak V603 camera last Christmas from my parents, who wanted to get me a camera that was small enough to fit in my purse but that I would be able to take great pictures with. This camera met all those expectations and worked great for months. I took tons of pictures and video (which both came out great - the pictures were excellent quality, and when you watch the videos you would never guess that they were dont with such a little digital camera!) In July of this year, I charged my battery and my spare battery, as I was going to a wedding and wanted to use the pictures as part of their wedding gift. We made the trip down there, only to find that my camera was not working - with either battery. The camera would turn on, ask for the date and time to be reprogrammed, and then immediately shut off. Kodak advised me to send the camera to them, as it was still covered under warranty. They have since received it, and after inspecting the camera they told me that they would have to charge me for the repair, stating that I must have dropped it for the camera to not be working properly. I can assure you that I have never dropped my camera; I took great care of it the entire time it was in my possession. The insane part of all this is that they want me to pay $160 to repair the camera. It only cost $200 to begin with! And if you don't repair it, they charge you $50 for inspecting the camera and shipping it back. The only other option is to \"scrap\" the camera - which of course is a great option for them, as you lose the camera and they get to refurbish it and sell it again. Either way, they get their money for the camera twice. I would pay to have it repaired, but I have no way of guaranteeing that this won't happen again. I know that I did not ever drop the camera, so if that's not really the reason for why it stopped working, how am I to know that it won't happen again? As a result of this, I have chosen to do a little research and purchase a camera from a different company. I absolutely loved this camera while I had it, and I don't deny that it took amazingly crisp, perfect pictures almost every time. I am just extremely unhappy with the service from Kodak, and I feel that before you purchase the camera, consider the service you will receive if it does stop working.", "Date": "September 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "error E45", "Author": "Demetri \"demetri\"", "ReviewID": "R2BTR4ISMWXK4V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera has been great, I've been using it for about 4 months, but i just got error E45 on screen -- lens will not retract.

It took great pictures and has great features.After less than a year the screws have started to come out; the bottom is being held together by duct tape.  Every once in a while the flash will dim so that none of my indoor pictures come out and then it will eventually return to full brightness for no apparent reason.Now if I zoom in to full optical zoom the camera shuts off.  This means I can't use the digital zoom at all and if I'm taking video and zoom \"too far\" I'm screwed.  I've missed some of my dog's cutest moments because my camera shuts off when I zoom in.Sometimes the camera won't turn on.  I'm assuming this is because the battery loses it's connection; if I take it out and put it back in the camera turns on fine.  It's annoying because whenever I change the battery I have to re-set the date and time, which is something I've never had to do with a camera before.It also seems that my close up pictures aren't coming out as nicely as they used to; they're coming out mid-quality rather than high quality.  This means that they'll come out slightly blurry when at full size making quality resizing impossible.My last digi was a Kodak EasyShare as well and diminishing quality over time seems to be a regular thing with Kodak cameras.", "Date": "August 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "F.Haddad", "Author": "FX \"FX\"", "ReviewID": "R29NXF3OE72NPM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As w/the other review, this camara is fantastic and produces quality fotos.

Not only that but Kodak's repair company wanted the same price to repair this camera again as buying an updated version.

So $30 later the battery arrives and still it does not work.We called customer service since the camera was still new. They first asked if the camera had been dropped or gotten wet. Absolutely not, she kept it in a padded case and when we went on vacation it was always attached to her belt loop. More often than not a parent held onto it so it was treated great. Not a single nic or ding.They said the problem we were describing was similiar to the camera having been dropped and not covered under warrantee. They refused to help out at all so after spending over $250 to buy the camera then get a new battery at their request, we are told our camera is OUR problem. No refund, no replacement, out of luck.So we are letting people know that BEWARE when buying from Kodak. Their camera's may look nice but they have terrible customer service. This was a large amount of money for us and we cannot afford to replace this camera so soon. We feel totally taken advantage of.

She presently has a Nikon Coolpix 775 and I print pictures on a couple of HP printers or use Wal-Mart or CVS.  She wanted a slim model that would fit in her purse. I wanted a model with a faster focus speed so that half her pictures wouldn't be blurry and a printer to use directly with the camera so that I would not have to transfer the pictures to the computer to print. (If you have had to listen to your wife complain about the red eye and the color being wrong you know what I mean.) I really hadn't expected to buy a Kodak. After several hours reading reviews of various camera makes and models, several reviewers casually mentioned the fast focus time of the Kodak V603. Based on these reviews of other cameras I decided to buy this camera (V603) and a S600 printer.The camera exceeded my expectations. First, the focus speed is very fast and there were no blurry pictures. Second, the double flash in the party mode eliminated all red eye, even the big white eyes that usually appeared in pictures of our dog. Third, the mode description in large letters on screen (the little pictures that no one can see or understand are still there) made it easy to choose the correct mode even without glasses. The picture quality was excellent.I purchased a 2gig memory card for the camera.The camera just sets on top of the printer and my wife can easily go through the images and simply push a button to print the ones she wants. It also charges the battery. The pictures are waterproof (another complaint my wife had with pictures from my HP printers) and excellent quality with no red eye. The dye sublimation pictures are a little more expensive than ink jet.I suggest purchasing the Kodak case fore the camera which I bought after Xmas.", "Date": "January 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Ultra compact easy to use camera", "Author": "Raymond A.

It has a very weak flash.  The spec's on the camera give it a range of 5 feet, which is accurate.  Anything greater than 5 feet, and the pictures come out way too dark.Any good camera will have a flash range of at least 11 feet.  The flash range on this camera is just impractical.  Who takes a picture from only 5 feet away?  All you can get is a picture of a head.Other than the flash, this is an excellent camera.  It takes great daytime shots.  The video is comprabable to other cameras this size.This is also one of the fastest cameras in terms of the shutter delay and the time between shots.  It doesn't turn on quite as fast as some newer cameras, but it is still pretty fast.This is only a 6.1 Mega pixal, and the new standard is 7 (and you can get the over 10).  6 is plenty for most people.  Also, because of the fewer pixals, this camera is faster than most of the newer, 7 pixal cameras.Like many pocket cameras now, this one does not have view finder.  You have to use the LCD screen.  I prefer to use a view finder, but that is probably just because of old habits.In summary, great camera to buy if you only take day time pictures.

The previous one I owned was a V530 which was very similar to this camera.  I was hoping that the V603 would correct one problem that plagued the V530 -- consistently dark pictures in full automatic mode.  Turns out this problem persists on this camera too, probably a result of using common software within both of these camera models.  But at least the V603 has a \"Perfect Touch\" picture fixup capability which, when applied to a dark picture, generally fixes the problem.  But you have to fix each picture individually using Perfect Touch which can be somewhat of a hassle.

The battery life is decent, and if you need more you can purchase additional batteries for only ten dollars on amazon.  It uses standard SD memory card which can be had for a very low cost, in comparison to other typed of memory cards.  As far as the cons go, the only one is that occasionally the pictures come out darker then you would like when using the auto mode.  This tends to happen occasionally indoors, and can be fixed by choosing the appropriate mode.  However this occurrence is rare, and easily made up for by the speed that the camera takes pictures with.  Another thing i found strange was the fact that by default, the auto focus assist light was constantly on when taking video, leaving a green light in the center of the video you shoot.

I am very impressed on the ease of use.

I LOVE the compact size and it fits perfectly in my pockey/purse, the LCD screen is HUGE and the rebound time from picture to picture is fast! So far I am a happy camper. I need to take this little sweetie to the amusement park and take some action shots to see how it performs in daylight.

Now that it's at the end of it's life, the Battery barely stays charged for 10 minutes, it can't zoom out very far without dying, but I still keep it handy in case I don't have my bulky DSLR with me to get that quick shot.", "Date": "November 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Gotta Love My Kodak...", "Author": "T.

I had an older model that my daughter dropped and was just past the warranty and it was going to cost $100 to fix so we opted to get a new and updated version for a few bucks more because it just wasn't worth fixing for so much money. The camera took nice enough basic pictures though I still had trouble with red eye, any pictures taken in low lighting came out dark, and enlarging shots after cropping made them grainy.  Then while taking some Easter photos of my girls the camera just went dead! I didn't drop it, or mistreat it having learned my lesson after the previous one! I kept getting an error message and thought it might be the battery so I bought a new one and tried that - still wouldn't work! The lend will not retract and the screen goes on for a few seconds and then goes black with an error message before shutting off! Of course it was going to be another $100+ to fix since it's past the warranty!  I have given up on Kodak! It's obvious that these cameras are not meant to last for long term and regular use! I have 2 small daughters and love taking pictures of them all the time!

I was upgrading from an older camera that had seen better days, so this one seemed almost magical in comparison.Pros:1)The LCD screen is very nice.2)Some of the features come in handy.Cons:1)It took great pictures at first, but then the pictures were very dark and blurry, for no reason. This is an off and on problem and doesn't make sense at all. From what I've read here, it happens often.2)The software is a b!&@$. It completely takes over your computer! Instead of opening with Windows, the pictures on my computer started opening with the Kodak software, which is awkward at best. I wouldn't mind so much if I was trying to edit the pictures but it gets annoying when you're just looking at pictures. After searching their website for instructions on how to change that, I finally had to email them for directions (trying to change the installation didn't do anything to fix this, hence the email for directions). My computer is extremely slow if the software is running.3)As another reviewer mentioned, the USB connection to the camera is very strange, for no apparent reason other than to get you to purchase the docking system. You can't just set the camera upright...that doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but for some reason it becomes one.4)The volume on the video playback is very low. I've had it turned completely up and still can't hear it. Once the video is on the computer, it's perfectly fine. This is a pain when you are taking video to capture something said...you can't make sure it's correct.5)I have noticed where the screws are starting to come loose on the bottom of the camera. Sure, I can screw them in but who wants to make sure the body of their camera is still together?I think I will be selling my camera soon.

I wanted the most for the least- the most features for the least amount of money! And I got it. I wanted a large LCD screen, 6 megapixels, a light, small model, that didn't require batteries, and that was under $300.Pros: Great battery life- lasts a long time on a single charge and gives you adequate low batter warning. Even when the warning comes one, pictures can still be taken. The first couple of times I used it, I tried to let the battery drain itself out before I charged it again, as I have heard that that makes the battery last longer.fast start up and picture speed- It starts up very quickly and the downtime between pictures is minimal.small size but big screen- I could carry it in my pocket (even thought i don't!) and it's very lightweight- but the LCD screen is still substantial. The screen is not as big as some, but much bigger than others!picture quality- pictures I ordered that were taken from this camera looked amazing! the colors were sharp and the pictures were clearpreset picture settings- I love the preset picture settings for different types of picture taking situations- i.e. bright snow scenes, bright beach scenes, candlelight, scenery. It lets me adjust the settings on the camera without actually having to do anything!Cons: The only con I can come up with is that it doesn't take great pictures at night or in low light. most of the time it takes better pictures with the flash off and to get a good low light picture i have to fiddle with the options a bit.

I lost that camera and bought this one in black because I was already used to the kodak buttons and setttings. This camera takes beautiful pictures outdoors (I have wonderful pictures I took with thi s camera while visting Paris) but at night outdoors it's hard to get a good shot at all. I also like to take my camera into bars and clubs and if the lighting is low all you see is shadows or with the flash off it's hard to get a shot that isn't completely blurred, it's pretty horrible in that aspect. Also sometimes indoor shots come out way too bright and people usually hate having their picture taken by my camera because of it. I have friends with less expensive cameras (including kodak's bulkier models) whose indoor shots come out great. Also, I use the video feature A LOT which I am pretty happy with but sometimes I don't know if I  am covering the mic somehow or what, but videos lately have been muffled and weird sounding.So right now I'm looking to upgrade to most likely a different brand with image stabilization and maybe that new face recognition feature that seems appealing.

I tried the Cannon, two different models of the Nikon  the OlympusI found may reasons not to keep the other cameras I tried , This Kodak camera is absolutely great it take a great photo, takes a SD card, I never even tried the Sony because I refused to buy a camera that will not use a standard memory format  for their storage why should you have to pay double the price just because  Sony and Olympus make special memory sticks for there cameras .The photos on the Kodak 603 are sharp  it has a (LARGE) lens the key to any camera is the larger the lens the better the photo.  It has may setting mostly automatic takes a great photo , as far as night photos , as with any small camera if you are taking a photo more that 10 feet away the flash just isn't going to do the job unless you have perfectconditions.Now one of the best features I found on this camera  is it takes absolutely great video , I would buy it just for the video it takes I have just played a bit with it  out of the box it look great I got a couple of 1 gig cards $14.00 each  a 5 min video is about 100 MegsIf you go to youtube.com and look at jimwebb603  you can view some of the video that was put up with this camera .Things  I don't like , the battery is small when it is used hard with the flash the camera will lock up and will need to be shut off and turned back on  I purchased a second battery on e-bay for under $10.00 including shipping this takes care of that problem.I do not use the software or the data cable I just pop the SD card our and put it in a reader and go from there , I did get a docking station for Christmas and I leave it in there so it is always charged .All in all I love this camera  for the $200 price range , I would recommend it , as my first choice the Nikon as second choice and the Cannon as a close second .

She loves it. The handling and look/feel are impeccable. So is the size. The shots we took are great when all works: flash, focus, etc. But sometimes the flash tends to be slow to recycle and the shots turn out to be dark, as the previous reviewers mentioned. The trick seems to be, don't take try to take consecutive shots with this thing. It's what it is: a toy like small mug shot camera. If you want something serious, go for DSLRs. Again, when the camera does work, the pictures turn out great.It has the usual shortcomings of this type of cutie cameras - no view finder, vulnerable big LCD, short battery life, weak flash, and so on. But so do all the other competitors. The important thing is, when it works, the picture quality is of DSLR quality. And it does work most of the time, if you are patient and careful.I found the USB clipper and the power cord without the craddle to be fantastic. My Sony DV cam requires that craddle to do everything, driving me nuts. I like just plug it in and get on with it, hassle free, great!As to the more \"advanced features\" on the camera, modes and customization etc. I advise is - try it at your own risk. Didn't work too well for me. I stick with the fully auto mode on this one. If you are serious about using thse fancy features, you really should try DSLR. This type of cutie cameras are not cut out for it. Oh, the video quality is fine, but nothing special there either.My only complaint is it doesn't come with a cute little case that matches the camera.By the way, I didn't have high expectations to this Kodak camera (or any Kodak camera) when I bought it.

Elegant high tech design.#2 LCD screen large and easy to view, even in sunlight.#3 Nicely combines 3 pictures in panoramic view before transferring them off the camera.#4 Takes reasonable video with sound.Cons#1 Pictures consistently turn out dark. The exposure compensation offers little help. It has a perfect touch feature that helps fix the darkness after the pictures are taken while still on the camera, but you have to do it to each picture flipping back and forth through menus on the camera. It takes a lot of time, effort and battery life.If you use one of the presets for low light conditions, there is virtually no way to prevent blurring unless you use a tripod and use the self timer so you can take a picture completely hands off. That is not convenient or care free as you are trying to enjoy your vacation activities.The colors are over saturated. Grass almost looks neon. The zoom and focus don't get along well together, so it becomes blur prone when using the zoom.#2 Battery life is so so. It will take 50-100 pictures before having to recharge the battery. The battery can take up to 2 hours to charge. Buying a second battery and travel charger that can plug into your house and car is a must.#3 LCD screen will finger print like you can't believe. If you touch it once, it will be horrible looking. I bought a screen protector that fixed that problem.#4 The computer cable plugs into the bottom of the camera and forces you to sit the camera down in a funky manner to unload your pictures. I think they did this so you will be pressed into buying their camera dock system.Conclusion.
