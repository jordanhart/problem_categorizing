The 0.1 lux is not sensitive enough. when used outdoors with moonlight, the human eye can see more in the darkness than this camera. since this does not have prime advantage, it may be difficult to return it.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$769.95", "Features": "Built-in 1/3\" Sony Effio CCD Image sensor\nDigital Signal Processor.
