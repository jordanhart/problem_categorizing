Lord \"J Man\"", "ReviewID": "R12HE00LBTFJDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "our last 3 camera's have been from kodac due to the fact that their price is set right for the options you get.  I would prefer an slr camera but my wife wanted something smaller and \"cute\", so we went with this.  The camera is actually very nice.  It takes really good pictures and has a feature that lets you upload pictures directly to facebook once it is synced to your computer.  It also has a nice panoramic setting which would be great for a long beach scene or something like that (pretty cool actually). The camera was priced right and comes with a usb charging cable and ac/dc adapter so you can plug into the wall or your computer to charge.  I would recommend buying.", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money !", "Author": "blondiedag", "ReviewID": "R1INAD9E4V909N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this Camera thinking it would take better pictures than my last Kodak because the megapixals was higher, boy did I think wrong. This Kodak takes really crappy video's and the pictures are pretty good, forget getting this Camera if you want to take a clear video, it takes very fuzzy video's. I would not waste your money on this camera, a big disapointment!", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the money!", "Author": "A CT Student \"lighthouse1970\"", "ReviewID": "R2GLRJ3I800DF6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to have a 5mp camera and there is such a huge difference in this 12mp camera! Wow! I especially love the rechargable battery! This is so convenient and well worth the extra $20.00 from the other camera I was looking at. It's nice and thin and slide right into my pocket. Nice!", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Waste of time and money", "Author": "Laura", "ReviewID": "R3B7MHIRO8LRY9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Don't waste your money on this camera.  While I certainly did not expect a lot for the price, I did expect to be able to take a quick photo, without a lot of hassle.  Since the Automatic Focus feature did not work correctly, this was not the case.  I am not sure if it was (I have returned the camera) defective, or just poorly designed, but it never worked.  I can take much better photos, quicker & easier, with my phone.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "great compact little camera", "Author": "Jo Kenny \"josie\"", "ReviewID": "R1HGGKXIQYTS8A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "handy compact, easy to use. you do have to hold it very still as the megapixil cameras require stillness to not blur the pic.I always take two pics of the same thing", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "camera happy", "Author": "Donna Weathers", "ReviewID": "R12KIAZE71K78O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is exactly what I wanted and takes good pictures.
