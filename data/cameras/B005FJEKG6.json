One power supply worked for like 5 minutes, then the camera went out again. Which showed me how terrible the picture quality was. Wow can you say super dark in broad daylight. The picture looked like a weird film had been put over the camera lens.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Black & White Cameras. Not Color as described. Used cameras and not new.", "Author": "emma", "ReviewID": "RFBSAXZJZU8R4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought six pcs of this camera and all the cameras gave me black and white image. I thought my cables and DVR were faulty so I replaced with a new cables and DVR and still they gave me black and white image. I replaced the cameras with different type I bought from UK and I had a nice color image. I had doubt about these cameras when I opened the package from the seller and realized they were poorly sellotaped and the manuals very dirty as if they have been returned by someone. Am really disappointed and am advising everyone not to buy such items from the seller. They intentionally sent me used black and white cameras.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "replaced my swann pro series cameras", "Author": "David M. Galligan", "ReviewID": "R318Q2GZA8B0MW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sorry swann, but these cameras were WAY better than your PRO series. Bought the 8x camera system, from fry's and wanted to get the wide angle lens, but they were out. So I went online and saw these for the same price as the replacement lens for the Swann cameras. I'm VERY happy with my purchase. The swivel bases are not as visually appealing but I just Spray paint the camera enclosures anyway so no problem.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works well, Slightly darker than Swann", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R9UHBV7TATAW2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have three Swann bullets and picked this up to fill a gap. Only difference I noticed is its not as bright as the Swanns, but is certainly bright enough. Night time range is the same as Swann..about 10 feet of clarity and then dark haze. I would say for indoors where there is a bright window I would prefer the Swanns. For outdoor or night use, or a room with more ambient light, this camera is fine.Indoors with just lamplight or ambient lightthe picture was great; with an open window in the frame and daylight coming through, it seems that it adjusts to the point that too much is darkened. The Swanns are able to compensate.I can email you two shots of the same room with the two different cameras if interested.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$56.00", "Features": "This Mini Size Color Video Surveillance Security Camera Can Be Used As One Component of Surveillance Systems in House, Hotel, Large square, Road, etc. Various Occasions.\nIP66 Waterproof Level, No Audio, 3.6mm Lens for Wide View Angle, BNC Connection, DC 12V 1000MA Regulated Power Supply.\nImage Sensor: CMOS,CDS Sensor.
