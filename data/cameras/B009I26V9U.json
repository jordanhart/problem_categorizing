Also needed a lighter camera than I had been using. I am still learning the G15 but find it easy to use and VERY capable. It is superb quality. Example of capability: watched the installation of a large stained glass window recently; finished about 10 pm. In low light conditions got a great shot of the glass (yes, lit from inside) and the brick building outside in the semi-dark. Auto mode, no flash. Great color, clear images.Order/delivery through Amazon (Beach Camera) was quick and flawless.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera!!", "Author": "Sue Steakley", "ReviewID": "R3FFHS0Y7N0PPZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had 3 of the previous models of the \"G\" series and this one is by for superior!!

There may be newer 2013 technology, but the G15 takes nice photos.  It is simple to use, very straightforward, and the zoom feature is quite decent.
