{"Reviews": [{"Title": "good for amateurs who can't get too close", "Author": "Dale Terrell", "ReviewID": "R2M7CWMPCL9D00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for its 40x zoom and reliance on replaceable batteries for a trip to Africa with little time to learn much about its use and found it easy to use and with a good stabilization pogram. I haven't had time to blow up the photos, but I used the 40x zoom to photograph hippos in a resevoir and found on reviewing the pictures that I had several recognizable yawn shots that I couldn't see with the naked eye.The video button is separate, so I didn't have to turn the top knob to begin shooting and could stop it and shoot photos immediately, a real convenience.The thumbnail descriptions of the options under \"scene\" and other options were critical, since the manual was on a CD and I had no laptop nor time to review it on the trip.I was surprised by the high battery use, however. Carry spares at all times! I did find that I could extend battery life by exchanging the positive and negative cells when the low battery warning appeared, which might be a short in my camera or a design flaw. I was shooting quite a few short videos, which might have had an impact.I didn't get to try the special effects and I left the camera in Africa with my daughter, but they looked interesting.The 8 GB card did develop a flaw that froze the camera when I was reviewing shots, and it could only be remedied by opening the battery compartment. I blame the card for this. The case was adequate and the lens cleaning kit useful.As I recall, the total was under $300 and the model had a high rating by Consumer Reports, hich had a major impact on my decision to buy it. There may be better choices with more flexibility and faster shutter response, but it met my needs.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Olympus SP-820UZ", "Author": "J.

It has a longer zoom but they tried to save size but placing the memory card in the battery compartment and the screen is only half the quality of the 590 UZ.  It's much cheaper also which is a plus.  I like it - the pictures have been as good but it seems to require a very steady hand or tripod for some types of photos I used to take by hand.  I FEELS cheaper but that might be my imagination.  Still no Camera Raw.", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.00", "Features": null, "Name": "Olympus SP-820UZ 14 Megapixel 40x Zoom Digital Camera Black 8GB Bundle", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512Q7lwYY5L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0096B91CM"}}
