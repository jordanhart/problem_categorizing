This camera has a 28X Optical zoom lens.  It takes four AA batteries, so that is a plus.  Camera comes with a Viewfinder and LCD panel.  It takes great daytime photos, but handheld night shots are a bit blurry.  Planning on purchasing a mono-pod to help reduce shaking.  The camera offers manual and automatic settings, plus a pop-up flash.  The camera looks nice too.  It would be nice if Fujifilm would produce some instructional videos to help purchasers get up to speed with some the camera's advanced features..  I was snapping pictures within minutes of opening the box.  If you want a great all around camera for a bargain price, then purchase one of these.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "I just bought this in walmart for $99", "Author": "shawna", "ReviewID": "R1H8GAI79NKO70", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works pretty well,  I don't know much about cameras but it gets the job done & comes with a lanyard type thing, chords to hook it up to the tv or computer, batteries, and a camera lense.
