Want to go fast around corners?  Then use soft sticky rubber to make them; but they will ware quickly as a result.  You say you have a luxury car and want a tire that offers a nice ride and long life; it\u2019s a hard rubber for you.  So what\u2019s the point to all of this?  All of the commercials I have seen advertising this camera do so as a snap shot camera.  A small, nicely designed snap shot camera with interchangeable lenses capable of quickly capturing a moment.  A purpose built product.Then as advertised this camera is on point:  It is a nice looking camera.  In your hand it is heavier than you would expect.  The fit and finish are excellent; the machining of high quality.  High quality, this is the impression it gives in your hand.  Pull it out, rotate the lens and it is on instantly.  Press the shutter button half way and focus is almost instant\u2026the rest of the way and done.  This camera is fast.  It is also accurate; focus is sharp almost every time.  You will rarely miss a moment; as quickly as you can pull this thing out you can take a picture.  And Nikon continues to release lenses for it\u2026Nikon if you are listening thanks and how about a fish eye.As for the photographic quality of the images I am very pleased.  I have a 35mm / full frame DSLR with several lenses in excess of $2500.00 each.  I did not buy this camera for exceptional image quality.  I bought it for its size and speed; I bought it to take kayaking.  Before I can capture a moment [kayaking] I need to get the camera out of a dry box which requires time.  That big buck will not stand and pose while I wait for the camera to turn on and focus.  I get most of my shots; and that is what I bought it for.  I find myself using it for more than just kayaking.  Of course I want good image quality\u2026if I didn\u2019t care about image quality I would have gotten myself a waterproof point and shoot.  I find the image color and quality of this camera pleasing [obviously much better than a waterproof point and shoot].  The files print nicely.  Of course that is an opinion.  From someone who is demanding enough to spend almost 3K on a lens.  You might like knowing my other camera is not a Nikon.  Because this point and shoot camera has the good looks, speed, and spontaneity as advertised with good image quality, I give it 5 stars.", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for me", "Author": "Jean Berch", "ReviewID": "R3FLHNAR5F4EWE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is just what I was looking for.

Lens F1.4 prime to F2.8 zoom Nikon lens.Why I buy this Nikon 1 J2:I always have the situation that \"I wish I bring my Camera with me). So, I really dream of a camera, so small that I can bring with me everyday, much better image quality than my Samsung Galaxy Note II, and smarter than P&S; camera. So, when Amazon have this for $249 Deal-of-the-day, I grab the deal.Nikon 1 design:* Mirror-les: meaning less bulky than DSLR but can have much better lens option.* 2.9 crop factor, great! That means more DOF, so 90% of the time, I will get In-focus picture. If you need shallow DOF, use full-frame with F2.8 lens or larger.* 10-30mm lens, great! They focus more on image quality than flexibility. I think 3X zoom is the maximum design compromise between IQ - Size - Price.* 10mp sensor. Another great decision! Meaning they aim this little toy for Low-light performance. Besides, 99% of our needs are sufficient for 10mp anyway.* Focusing is snap and accurate.* Image Quality: I just amazed how sharp and detail the image. Perfect combination of design and engineering.* In field operation: Snappy and accurate!Improvement/Wishlist:* Better lens cap. I decide not to use the lens cap, afraid of loosing it. Just put a Tiffen Filter, and HN-N101 lens hood and I am always ready to go.* PSAM, wish that they include the PSAM in the rotary dial, rather than menu.* Built quality: I am not sure, the front element of the lens will survive. It is plastic and as I use it everyday without any case/bag/protector (only Filter and Hood) time will tell...* I wish they make a 20mm F2.8 wide angle prime lens (35mm equivalent pancake), and this is really a to-go dream camera.* Nice to have: GPS, WIFI, CLS commander mode for the built-in flash, Stereo external Mic jack with Audio Level meter, Waterproof (and sell it for $249!).Complain:* FT-1 adapter is really nice to have (to use my premium glass), but why $269? If you sell it for $26.9 I bet you will sell it as many as the camera itself! (Economic of scale Nikon, c'mon..). And by then, there is a new horizon for this camera. Imagine using the 50mm F1.4 AF-S for portrait? wow...! Or at least the $199 35mm F1.8 AF-S DX....Conclusion:* This is a day-to-day candid camera that serve BEST image quality ever offered by camera of this size* Do not expect BOKEH, or professional look portrait! Use your full frame, or at least APS-C DSLR and shoot with at least 70mm F2.8", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice camera", "Author": "Tokyo", "ReviewID": "R2UFB5TZMGPYU8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "nice camera, good lenses, many features but easy to use, light weight, fast, sufficient flash light, good manual, typical Nikon so to say", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera!!", "Author": "LouiseH", "ReviewID": "R8FR97E2U70Y8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This fabulous little camera replaced my larger slr and does not disappoint.

This product does not fit MY needs but I'm sure it's an amazing camera with what it was intended to do.My primary reason for buying this camera was to take pictures of MOVING kids INDOORS which seems to be the major flaw of this camera. I came from a Nikon D3100 (which is the same price as the Nikon 1 J2 fyi) to this camera which was the biggest mistake in my life. My wife wanted it as a fashion accessory since she has a white iPhone and a white iPad and a white computer. She wanted to get a white Nikon 1 since she was so impressed with the D3100 and wanted to stick with Nikon in a slimmer fashion.EVERY picture we took of this camera came out BLURRY and GRAINY. Even though I am a DSLR amateur, I am not internet illiterate and I spent days finding every trick in the book to get this camera to work better. Everything from manually changing ISO settings to shutter speeds to vibration reduction technology, to specific guides tailored to the J1/J2 about reducing blurriness and graininess, etc. I've pretty much done everything and I had little to no improvement. I want to use this camera as a point and shoot, not have to go in and manually change settings for every type of picture I want to take. All I had to do on the D3100 was change a dial settings for like \"baby mode\" or \"fast moving scene mode\" unlike this camera which just have gimmicky dial settings I would never use.From reading previous reviews of the J1 model, I kind of knew what I was getting myself into. I knew the quality would not be as good as the D3100, but my wife and I felt like the smaller profile and custom color options would be worth the sacrifice. As I am typing this, my wife is packing up the J2 right now and we are re-buying a D3100 again. We have done side-by-side comparison shots taken from my older D3100 and the J2 and the difference is night and day. This is while I never even had to touch a single setting in the D3100 ever. I can actually see the pores on my kids' faces while crisp and clear while all I see in the J2 pictures are blurry and grainy photos which don't even look much better than ones taken from my iPhone5. I even bought the $250 30-110 zoom lens so I know I don't have a faulty lens or something.Again, I'm sure this camera is amazing for outdoor, stationary, natural light shots but not for my uses. Maybe if I was a professional, I could spend 3 minutes tweaking the camera every time I wanted to take a different type of picture but that's not what I bought it for. Do yourself a favor, just buy a D3100 camera that's the same price, slightly bulkier/heavier, if you want crisp, clear, high quality, high resolution photos in an easy point-and-shoot format and call it a day.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazingly fast and quiet option for amateur photographers", "Author": "Kylie Larson", "ReviewID": "R3OJHF7R0PFXL2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've considered myself an iPhone photography nut for a little over a year now: I'm not just taking snapshots with my iPhone, but really learning about the digital limits of the phone and editing significantly to get great results. I knew I was always going to keep being an iPhotographer, but I wanted to have something in my arsenal for higher quality images as well. I immediately considered DSLRs and purchased a Canon Rebel. I hated it! After spending so much time photographing scenes with my quiet and stealthy phone I couldn't stand the bulk and noise of the DSLR (even though Canons are known for their smaller size and sound). I returned the Canon within days and began my search over again.I found the Nikon 1 series after reading Steve Huff's reviews on his blog and I was sold. When it arrived I knew within a few minutes that it was the product for me. It is so light, absolutely silent (not a sound. seriously.) and the images are BEAUTIFUL. I take a mix of portraits and landscapes and my amateur opinion is that this camera is best suited for landscapes -- it doesn't give portraits that buttery/floating-on-cloud feeling. That being said, I've recently started taking portraits as part of a personal photo project with this camera and I'm getting great results - they just have a different style than you see on so many portrait blogs these days.This camera is also great for kids/dogs: it's so fast that it can capture quick motion and once again it's quiet (my dog was terrified of the noise the Canon made and ran around the corner which sort of defeated the point). It is also excellent in low light. I've only used my flash to test the flash, but I've never had to deploy it in a real situation yet.The kit lens is okay. It does particularly well for landscapes. If I could do over again, though, I'd probably purchase the body only and then buy the 1.8 and 2.8 and be done with it. I hate zoom lenses and those two tiny, but powerful, lenses are all I need.To summarize, I love this camera. The sensor size is a big drawback for a lot of people, but I have a feeling that 90% of amateur photographers wouldn't mind this sensor size a bit.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera (so far)", "Author": "jawden", "ReviewID": "R3UFI3VXI6TXQD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although the Memory Card that came with this camera seemed to have caused major issues (my photos would just \"vanish\" off the camera and I would receive a message stating \"Memory Card has not been formatted - format memory card now?\" and all photos I had taken would be gone.

Yes, there are some \"silly,\" \"gimmicky\" features, but outside of that, this can produce some truly lovely photos.I wanted a light, simple camera for travel. This is small enough that I can literally wear it diagonally (from my shoulder to hip) and then zip my jacket tightly to still go on The Tower of Terror at Disney. This isn't one of those cameras that makes you the \"photographer\" of the group who can't participate because it always \"gets in the way.\" That's why this is now my go-to camera for all vacations. (And, it is super resilient! It has definitely taken some \"throwing around\" and general abuse ... and, it looks the same as it did on day-one).When we travel, I love going to new bakeries/patisseries/chocolateries and capturing tons of photos of delightful little treats. This camera is sensitive enough to make all the little sugar granules and artistry crisp and beautiful. Now, it isn't perfect for close-up work (you will need to purchase the other lens for that), but it is entirely adequate (if you have a little patience with it).Likewise, this Nikon has a few simple \"unnecessary\" features that I can make \"work.\" The spot-color is fun (when used extremely sparingly), the miniature feature is a neat little gimmick (but the only time I really made this worthwhile was at Fenway Park), and the panorama feature can produce some pretty interesting pictures if you go slow and move evenly. Still, we have never used these pictures for anything other than our own amusement.The battery has a surprisingly long charge. Usually, I do not need to even bring my charger with me on vacation (my average between charges is about a week).If you already have a \"nice\" camera but want a smaller one to make your family trips more about the family (and not trying to find a locker for the camera), this could be it.Now, it's crucial to know that I am not looking to take photos beyond cataloging our adventures for my family (or to publish on Yelp/Urbanspoon). If you are an artist, this will certainly not be an appropriate camera for you. (There are some great posts here to walk you through that choice ... rely on some of these excellent reviews for that).Umm, and yeah, it's as sleek and awesome as it looks. I have received more compliments on it than I can even count. Last summer, I was in a huge line at Flour + Bakery in Boston's Back Bay and the guy behind the counter stopped the whole procession to ask me about it. So, yep, it's pretty cool, too.Good luck!", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "I bought two Nikon 1 cameras", "Author": "E. Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R2KPM9D9LJY3SO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I shoot 3D still and video and managed to snag both a J1 and a J2 at great used prices here on Amazon. One was \"used\" and the other \"refurbished\" but turned out the used one was actually new, in the original packaging. I originally thought I'd use these mostly as a light weight pair (compared to larger cameras) for 3D photography. But now I use either camera as a high quality \"point and shoot\" too for old fashioned 2D. The image quality is definitely better than the my Canon SX1 - and with interchangeable lenses, these cameras are much more than a mere point and shoot.  Low light sensitivity is also much better than the SX1 (or similar SX-nn line), although not as good as a much larger sensor.But the beauty of the Nikon 1 is that it has a modest size sensor, which means quite decent low light and dynamic range performance, but with the convenience of small size. Lens are correspondingly smaller and lower priced too. If you want to travel light, yet get performance that feels more like a higher end mirrorless or DSLR camera, these are convenient and fun to use. Just can't beat the performance for this size of a camera.The only issue I have with the Nikon 1 cameras is Nikon's lack of a manual focusing aid. I use various lenses on these cameras including old manual Minolta lenses and Super 16mm film camera lenses. Manual focusing using the LCD usually works fine but there are times where a focusing aid would be helpful. (Both the SX1 and the Lumix GH2, for example, enlarge a small section of the image so you can get a precise focus).But realistically, that's a minor issue and only applies if you are using \"other lenses\". Using the Nikkor lenses, auto focusing is extremely fast and precise.I like the color and contrast that the Nikon 1 cameras have by default, and in fact, have now tweaked settings in my non-Nikon cameras to match :) I shoot almost everything in RAW mode and process my images in Lightroom.Note - if you prefer an eye viewfinder over the LCD-only version, consider the V1, V2 or V3 versions.As to the H2's orange color - well, I don't care about the color.

The total weight for the above was less than half a kg. Try that with an SLR it will come over 1kg.  If u take a Sony or canon CSC that have a full size sensor the weight will be much closer to a SLR without the advantage of an optical view finder of an SLR. The main weight and bulk comes from the lenses rather than the camera.Picture quality is excellent in normal light conditions and will match a SLR and it is also faster than quite a few SLR,s.Laws of physics cannot be bent however and in low light SLR will be better.

I hope you find this review helpful. Pro's and Cons are below. I'm going to cover all of the bases on what I liked and disliked about the Nikon 1 J2. First off, I had this camera for about a month and I got to try out all of the different thing's and formed my opinion. I bought this camera in November and returned it exactly a month later in December. I am a beginner photographer and I guess I was expecting more from this Nikon. The day I got it I played with it for about 3 hours total and had to charge it over night. This battery was different from previous ones I've owned because it starts to lose it's charge if you don't use it after charging it. So extra battery's will all need charges before going out and shooting. The camera got warm after about ten minutes of use and I started to worry but I had seen some similar complaints and assumed it was okay. I would put it aside, let it cool down, and pick it back up to start shooting again. It would get warm again but I noticed it gets warm quicker if you are shooting a video. Video quality (in 1080p) is great. I played around with it but didn't try any lower options. You can shoot 20 minutes of consecutive video. There is no internal memory so you need to own a memory card. Microphone quality isn't very good. A bit better than a Digital camera I would say but not impressive. Video does well in low lit situations but not in dark. The picture quality really disappointed me. I shot 240 pictures on Christmas Eve during the family 'Secret Santa'; I put them on the computer and found that all but a few were blurry. The focus is hard because it doesn't always focus on what you want. Instead of getting the present opening it focused on the little bit of the Christmas tree. The rest of the picture was a blur. That being said, I do not think this camera is good for motion shots. As far as stills, I did not test it with a tripod but I could see it being significantly better. The built in flash feels as if i could snap it off. It rises high enough where you don't get the shadow but I personally don't use flash so it didn't bug me.  The concept was clever. You also cannot attach a external flash which some may want. I do like the interchangeable lens. The button to press and rotate the zoom ring is okay. Sometimes I felt the button was broken though.It can fit in a standard sized camera bag. The one I had for this was about 20.00 which isn't bad at all.  I liked the auto mode (The green option on the dial) because if you want someone to take a quick snap of you and a group or anywhere, the camera will adjust the settings for you. Nothing can be done manually in this mode you'll have to switch to Creative and select P,S,A,M.If you want to shoot kids, I wouldn't recommend this because it isn't good at motion shots. You need a very steady hand or a tripod. I don't know what they changed with the Nikon 1 j3 but I wonder if any of these things were fixed. I would say this is a good camera if you're young but if you're older, I would suggest a nicer camera for quality reasons.All of these things can be found in a DSLR and I expected these things to be able to be shown in this camera.Pros:- 1080p video quality is good.- Like the interchangeable lens option- It's mirrorless- Creative mode has so many options. Really like the Panorama and Selective color- Auto mode is good for quick snapsCons:- Camera gets warm. Mostly while filming but still noticed it while shooting.- Microphone quality isn't great while filming and there is no option of adding an external mic- No way to add an external mic- Lots of grain and noise in the photos. Especially if you crop it.- Focus is hard to control- Photo's were coming out blurry and I couldn't control it with settings.- Motion shots are very bad. Picture's come out blurry when somethings in slight motion.- Body feels easily damaged- Doesn't get very manualAmazon was really good and quick about returning it.

I am sending back today. The focus is so bad, the picture quality, well, has no quality. No depth of field...the photos are 'flat' even in 'vivid' mode, and the lenses are gimmicks. If you want a camera for shooting at beaches/bars etc, spend $100 or less and you will get the same quality....perhaps better than this. If you want true quality, a Nikon d3100 is really the best camera around (see Ken Rockwell's (the guru of cameras) comments on the d3100 (body only about $300-400.). I wasn't put off by the 10mp but once I got this in my hands I realize what a waste of money this was. I am now looking at the new Panasonic Lumix coming out mid august w a 60x zoom, and 16.1 mp and only $399. 1.3 pounds, a lightweight...what I wanted after my heavy d7000.I need a small compact for those days I don't want to lug around the d7000 and my various lenses. But the Nikon 1 is NOT worth the money.UPDATE: After doing my homework opted for Nikon Coolpix p510. SUPER, SUPER nice camera. 16.1 mp, 42Xzoom, full 1080 hd video, and used for a cool $180, and in red.  SOOOOOOO much better quality photos than  than Nikon 1. Saved $$$$ and a much better quality. If you think of getting one yourself...PASS ON the P520..just because it is an older model does not make it better. The P510 is a class in itself!", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "So so, after testing this myself, think Nikon got this one wrong", "Author": "Dealzguy \"Dealzguy\"", "ReviewID": "R1OHCIZX1T5KL7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There are so many reviews. Firstly, may be the J series caters to certain kind of end customers. Me certainly not one of them. Having said that this might suit someone perfectly who is moving up from a regular P&S; type of camera or soccer / hockey moms and dads who do not want to lug a heavy traditional DSLR.Pros:1. Light weight, well constructed metal body, easy to carry, easy to operate2. Super fast auto-focus (but again in low light slows down - probably due to the lenses f3.5 to 5.6)3. The 400 and 1200 fps movie modes are novel, gives a 5 sec slo-mo clip that actually play back for 1 min and 3.5 mins approximately. ( main reason, I bought this)4. IQ - Nice IQ upto ISO 800, bright and well saturated colors (also see con on softness and low light)5. Action and subject tracker works very well including video. This alone could be good for someone who is interested in kids and games photo / video graphyCons:1. Slow lens, other fast lens options are so limited, I soon realized the disadvantages of straying away from an established system to a new one with restricted lens options.2. I kept getting a lens error on the 10-30 mm. My guess is the contacts had some loose connectivity as slightly turning  back the lens it resolve it, but again when zooming in and out, occasionally this error would repeat. This may be a one-off issue strictly.3. The release button in the zoom. Really takes getting used to if you are a regular DSLR user and it was apparent this was becoming a PITA and making me miss action4. Ergonomics - coming from regular semi-pro DSLR use, this was an ergonomic disaster for me. No grip, smooth body for finger rest, coupled with the lens release and using lcd to compose, gosh, I was like a first timer handling a camera.5. Picture quality - again I am thinking it is the lens. very nice, saturated colors, but images are on softer side, grainy from anything upwards of ISO 800. So low light is pretty quickly ruled out and in good daylight, a quality advanced P&S; like S110, LX7, or Nikon's own P7000 series model provide almost the same quality. If you need the 1\" sensor look at RX100 or a Fuji etc.In summary, too many cons for me than pros and had to give up on this one. Again, may suit someone else perfectly well.So in the quest for a mirrorless system, next stop I am thinking is M43 which may be the right balance of small vs big !

The thing JUST came out and it's ALREADY discounted by over $100. What else do you need to know??? Geez...Nikon has not learned its lesson AT ALL! The J1 is a horrible camera primarily because the ergonomics are truly so god awfully poor that the camera is truly relegated to point-and-shoot (PNS) status and the autofocus simply doesn't work in dim or dark lighting even with the AF assist illuminator on. The upgrade to a legitimate mode dial with real modes would have made a HUGE difference and would have been a really really easy fix. But no. No update to the useless mode dial that lets you choose between crappy mode and movie mode. It's a horrible PNS camera and it's a huge PNS camera, in relative terms. The J2 ignored those GLARING flaws, and instead gave it more garbage modes. And now it's also available in orange... in addition to pink, red, white silver and black. What, no blue and/or green, tiger stripes or leopard spots??? Obviously, you can see where their sole priority is with this premium-PRICED camera line... If not, I'll spell it out for you: It's a fashion accessory disguised as a camera.Nikon, Nikon, Nikon... My D800E is the most amazing camera I've ever used (though the ergonomics could be more like, well, the D600's) and I just ordered my D600 today, so you're clearly doing something right. But WHY in the world are you wasting time on this piece of junk Nikon 1 line??? They are embarrassingly poor cameras that merely look pretty. Only thing that makes sense to me is that they are VERY high margin cameras that suckers do occasionally fall for. And I gotta admit, that candy red is GORGEOUS! And I noticed that the D3200 is available in that red... Could it be because I previously gushed about the color in my harsh criticism of the J1? ;)Look, the Canon S100 makes better-looking images, has WORLDS better ergonomics, catches MANY MANY more images that the Nikon 1 line would miss, is about half the price and fits in a jeans pocket. Don't take my word, look at the customer images on those respective cameras' Amazon pages and you'll see CLEARLY what I'm talking about in regards to the S100's images looking better! Aside from the candy red color of the J1, and I'm dead serious here, I see NO reason to use a J1, J2 or V1, never mind spend money on one. They are truly terrible and the S100 is truly awesome.Lol, this awful Nikon 1 line is such a thorn in my side because it makes sense for NOBODY. PNS seekers can get MUCH better cameras like the Canon S100 (which is actually better than its successor the S110) or the Lumix ZS20 (if you don't need RAW) for MUCH less money and that actually fit in a jeans pocket. More serious photographers willing to opt for larger-than-pocket-cameras can get a Canon T3i or Nikon D3200 or D5100 for less or the same money as a J2. You barely save size/weight with a J1, J2 or V1 over a D3200, D5100 or T3i with an 18-55mm kit lens and you get a WWWAAAYYY better camera. Or if you want something smaller than a DSLR and actually smaller than a J2 but still not pocketable, with WAY better ergonomics and actually is less expensive, get a Nikon P7700.Come on, Nikon. Save face. Dump the line and put it behind you. Stop \"chasing\" this lost bet. Seriously. Take the J1/J2/V1 sensor (which is a really nice sensor), image processor, Live View and monitor and put them in a new body that's JUST like the Canon S100's or Sony RX100's with the menus of the D800E's or D5100's. For those considering the overpriced Sony RX100, I don't think its images look nearly as good as the S100's. Again, check the customer photos on their Amazon pages. Yes, Nikon just released the P7700. Pretty nice and smart camera, particularly considering Canon TOTALLY dropped the ball with the G15 and took a giant leap backwards in abandoning the articulating screen. However, neither the P7700 nor the G15 will fit in a pocket like the S100 will. Come on, Nikon. Start a new \"C\" line and start it with a model called the \"C100\" that harvests all the good parts of the Nikon 1 and puts them in a TRULY POCKETABLE (think EXACTLY Canon S100 dimensions) and give it the S100's or P7700's ergonomics, including mode ring around the lens, give it a NON-CHANGEABLE 24-120mm F1.8-2.8 lens with low distortion, Nikon DSLR menus and you will become a REAL player in the high-end PNS market instead of perpetually playing catch-up with Canon, and then embarrassing yourself so completely with something like the Nikon 1 line. Do it right once and for all. Clean slate. That's what Sony did. Look, the Canon S line defined the pocket camera genre, a genre in which you have no respectable representation. Accept that. Stop trying to reinvent the wheel. Now, you have the tools to at least compete with them, if not possibly beat them.
