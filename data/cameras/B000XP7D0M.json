{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Sony Cam", "Author": "aj4mq", "ReviewID": "R3M25BAYGZPKD9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For those who have a streetlight nearby, this camera is fantastic at night. better than most security cameras I have had to work with. Did have to crack open the case to set the focus correctly, but very compatible with any DVR system. Hope the HD cameras do as well. (Not CMOS, but CCD, so colors are off, but you can adjust for that. If someone is wearing a black shirt, it may appear light purple because it reflects infrared.) The front of this camera is the size of a U.S. Quarter, and about 4-5\" Long, and has a bit of weight to it. Very highly recommended, and will be buying more soon. (Wish they came in black.)", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Nice Pinhole Camera", "Author": "Jason Y.", "ReviewID": "R1OVN5F8M35W6Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera about a year ago for my business and so far so good! It works really well. The resolution is pretty good when comparing to other pinhole cameras I've seen. The only complaint I have is that when I first opened the box there was an instruction that was very unclear. Matter of fact, it wasn't even an instruction! It was more like a description of the camera on a small piece of paper. Also, there were a few typos on it so it didn't look professional at all. Other than that I like the camera. I would recommend this product to anyone that's looking for a simple camera.", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "simple camera", "Author": "mike", "ReviewID": "RR3872HSNCX53", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have 3hi rez cameras around the outside of my work.  This (400 lines)  camera I mounted by drilling a hole into the wall and mounted flush to the outside.  As people enter the building they are not aware or this camera.  The rez is actually excellent because the camera is less than 8 feet from their face.I am more than happy with this camera.  Bottom line,  camera position is as important as resolution.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$264.95", "Features": "Built-in Sony CCD image sensor, color DSP.
