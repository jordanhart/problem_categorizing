{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid and trustworthy camera", "Author": "RODNEY V. MCCORMICK \"RodneyV\"", "ReviewID": "RD1HWPQ32GH6N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned this version of the Ricoh KR-5 as well as the Super and Super II, which I gave to my kids. While this lacks a range of shutter speeds I occasionally use, the light meter is much easier to use than the system on the Super II. The kit zoom lens that often comes with the camera is not as clear as an available 50 mm f/2.0 lens that works well for clarity. I usually use B&W; film and process it myself as a hobby. For those who need an SLR camera that is easy and reliable, I would recommend this despite the limited range of schutter speeds.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002KIKXT8"}}
