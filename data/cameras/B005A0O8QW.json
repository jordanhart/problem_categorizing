Many of them are foscam derivatives and I am reasonably happy with all of them.This is my second experience with Agasio cameras however, and both times the product was just junk.  My first try was with these HD cameras:http://www.amazon.com/Agasio-Megapixel-Wireless-Linkages-Definition/dp/B005DOTAMW/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1336227432&sr;=8-3I bought 2 of these cameras, they never worked properly.Despite the bad experience with the other Agasio cameras, and the bad reviews on the A602 I decided to take a risk.The Agasio A602W is also just trash.  I set the camera up easily, but after that nothing went right.  The camera does not boot consistently.  If you unplug it and plug it back in it only starts maybe 1 in 10 times.  When it does start, the video cuts in and out.  There is an audible clicking sound that the camera makes over and over again, sometimes for hours.  I assume this is the cut filter or something with the IR trying to figure out if it needs to engage.Normally I would assume that I just received a bad camera.  But since this is my third product from this manufacturer I'm starting to think this brand is garbage.Try at your own risk, but my advice is to stay away.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good if you use the cable but terrible wireless range", "Author": "D.

The cable coming out of the back of the camera does not appear to be weatherized. It's probably suitable for my purpose (I intend to mount it under a roof to surveil my front porch), but it is definitely not suited to true outdoor deployment.Many of the camera's functions are not available via the generic web interface, so if you aren't running Windows (and I am not), caveat emptor.The connections into the camera are very poor choices. The 5V power supply is via a simple (tiny) coaxial plug (not weatherized). There is no POE support on the hardwire ethernet connector. A reset button is also integrated into the cable. The cable is not removable and you cannot substitute hardwired power to the camera for a more secure installation. The cable provided is only about 3 feet long so your options to secure it are limited. My plan is to place a small outdoor electrical box on the wall next to the camera mount and place all the connections and a small 5V power supply inside that (hard wired).Otherwise the camera seems to mostly do as it claims and work reasonably well.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "NO GOOD", "Author": "RS", "ReviewID": "R3244YODPBMPH8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Junk.

Nice mount, very sturdy and looks more clean and slick. The only advantage to the Agasio I saw is that it has a 10db attenna, but that's it.

Stick to the Foscam brand since the Agasio website is nothing but junk and the forums are full of spam. Foscam site is a bit better. Also when planning to use these camera's with surveillance software, Foscam drivers are the most common.I am using the Agasio 502W with the Synology Disk Station NAS that also has a surveillance software builtin. The Agasio 502W corresponds to the Foscam 8918W and the Agasio 612W with Foscam 8905W for the purposes of the configuration. Also this is an MJPEG camera and not a H264 - so audio is only possible through dedicated apps not through surveillance software like the Synology. Foscam's H264 camera's have audio but from what I hear is difficult to setup and disconnects often.The Agasio 502W and Agasio 612W both were easy to setup and the web interface, while clunky, worked well enough. You MUST be tech savvy to know Dynamic IP vs Static IP etc. The presets in Agasio 502W are useful - however, they get messed up very easily by a cam viewer and once disturbed, it confuses the surveillance station. I have it setup so that when motion is triggered, it goes trough a preset patrol sequence and records the movie. This has worked well except when the presets are disturbed manually.Also note that the Agasio 502W has a much wider field of view than Agasio 612W. Also while the Agasio 612W is waterproof, both are NOT meant for freezing temperatures.I have both Agasio 502W and Agasio 612W setup wirelessly through an Apple Time Machine Airport router to the Synology DS and they have worked well without disconnect. Recordings have also been good and motion detection has worked well.I am going to keep both Agasio 502W and Agasio 612W camera's and see how they perform.NOTE- WARNING - If you are accessing the camera's through a Dynamic DNS service, be VERY CAREFUL - there are several hacks and cracks available online that will allow strangers to break in, view and monitor your camera's. See this:http://www.informationweek.com/security/vulnerabilities/wireless-camera-flaws-allow-remote-explo/240153001#mc_jiveSo using the camera's via a surveillance software is recommended.

Open the box, and \"Hey, surprise! Look what's hanging there.\" The whole purpose of going wireless is so there is no network wire running up to the camera. I am not going to give it one star for being misleading, so I will simply give it three stars.Update:Okay, after I got over the shock of the camera having a tail, I was okay with it. I mounted it by my front door, so we could see you is ringing our bell. I t works well at this, and it works during the day and at night, which is really cool. I would be happier, if the lens had a wider angle, because it is difficult to set up so that we can see a person's face at different distances.I also set the email function. Now, every time someone enters or exists our house, i get sent up to six photos. Really cool to watch.

I am very familiar with setting up wired and wireless network hardware so this was no problem, indeed it has one of the easier interfaces I've encountered.  The unit seems sturdy and has a nice metal enclosure.When installing, the supplied bracket is completely functional although low-cost.  The short pigtail of wires will cause problems for some home installers - I made a long low-voltage power lead and then used a higher voltage supply at the end of it to provide the camera with 5v after the drop in the wire.  I am using wireless-G for the network connection, which is not my preference (wired would be for smoother image and robustness) but the location is too difficult for wired.The image quality is good both day and night.  The advertised 67-degree viewing angle is true, corner to corner, so imagine about +-30 degrees of the camera's boresight and that's your field of view.  It seems small when you get it setup, so you'll need to mount far/high up.
