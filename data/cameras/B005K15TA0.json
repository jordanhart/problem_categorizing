Clean crisp pictures come out of this baby!  It has many different settings and I like to use them all.  I am a big fan of FujiFilm SLR style digital cameras. I always have it somewhere with me.  I am an aspiring freelance photographer and am in my beginning stages so this is definitely a great camera for beginners.  If you are looking for a decently priced camera, this is a great choice. You won't be disappointed!", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice camera for beginners", "Author": "liljamie", "ReviewID": "R3UP919GSKL6Q1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great camera for beginners.

Because they said they were out of the S3400 even though it showed being in stock.  The S4300 only had 26x zoom and a couple other things I didn't really like.  So, I had to send it back.  Then I had to find and order another camera.  I'm sure I would have really liked this camera, if it would have been sent to me(& not out of stock).", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Verry good litter camer", "Author": "Ernest", "ReviewID": "R2MPL96M75CJC6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This a good camer I got my monday love it I will be get fuji sh20 to day  I know it a good one to", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$165.39", "Features": "14.0 million pixels\n1/2.3-inch CCD with primary color filter\nFujinon 28x optical zoom lens", "Name": "FUJIFILM FinePix S3400 Black 14 MP 3.0\" LCD 28X Optical Zoom 24mm Wide Angle Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZBsq3Pv5L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005K15TA0"}}
