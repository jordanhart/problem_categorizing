{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fair DVR, terrible cameras", "Author": "cctv", "ReviewID": "RY7R4S3BRC4SQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been installing pro level CCTV systems for more than 20 years.  Since I can not afford to install one of my company's pro level systems in my home I decided to try this Lorex DVR and camera package.  I know from experience that you get what you pay for so I was not expecting a great system, but was hoping for an O.K. system.  As far as the DVR goes it is about what I expected and I would have been happy with this package if not for the included cameras.  During good lighting they were just passable but in low light mode with or without it being in the IR mode, the cameras AGC (Automatic Gain Control) pushed the camera to its limits to try and get a picture.  By doing that the camera created so much noise that the DVR thought it was motion.  Looking at the motion sensitivity meter, the meter was pinned to the top of the scale and no matter how you adjusted the motion detection level the DVR still saw this camera noise as motion.  Now, if you do not plan on using the motion activation mode of the DVR this may not be a big deal but if you are then forget it.  The DVR will keep recording all night causing it to fill up the hard drive much quicker.  Because of this poor design and a bad description in their catalog for this unit, Amazon paid the return shipping, something many dot coms would not do, thanks Amazon.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tough Remote Viewing Setup, Crummy Tech Support", "Author": "The Mighty Enrique", "ReviewID": "R2BZHDEOAPS9OH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First impressions of this product were good - well packaged, seemed to be well documented. BUT...I can't get the thing to be visible over the internet. I use an Apple Airport Extreme, and Lorex seems to support Windows only. They have lots of user guides, all aimed at Windows and other brands of routers. I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually, but I did call Lorex tech support, and after waiting on hold for over 20 min, I was told I'd get a call back in an hour or two. Of course, I wasn't at my desk when they called, so I have to wait until \"sometime tomorrow\" for them to call.So - so far, a mixed experience. We'll see if I can finally get ports forwarded to view remotely.**Update: Tech support awful. Finally swapped out my Apple Airport Extreme for a Netgear wireless router. Set up very quickly after that. So, the issue seems to have been with the Apple Airport Extreme, which is a shame because I'm a real Mac fan. But at least it's resolved. So, word to the wise - use a Netgear router and you should be okay.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awful", "Author": "Doke Scott", "ReviewID": "R1MFSVUVQXXWW8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The claim that it works with many types of clients is false advertising.  It really only works with selected versions of IE for Windows.  It requires browser plugins that most corporate, library, or public computers will not permit.  A few other clients have very limited, view-only functionality, but they require special applications, and are very hard to get to work.  It will not work at all with a standard web browser.  Motion sensing does not work correctly, especially in low light.  Image quality is poor.  Documentation is poor.  There is no API to let you integrate it with a larger security system.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great DVR", "Author": "Cep", "ReviewID": "R1ZWMIWUKZVPS5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned it for over a year now and I Love it.  I have it hooked up to my TV through the VGA (I would have hoped it had a DVI) output. Its tied into my home network where I can access it from my home computers, I also have it on the internet where it gives me the peace of mind when I travel, because I can access it on the internet and even my phone thru downloadable apps.Their web site offers software upgrades which I have done successfully with 3 different upgrades.Two of the provided outdoor cameras had lost their color and only displayed B/W before the first year warranty was up. The customer service was great and were willing to replace them.  With a discounted upgrade price I was able to get two new High resolution outdoor cameras and they work great.Lorex was recommended to me and I am glad with my decision.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "NOT FOR OUTDOOR USE", "Author": "tmad99", "ReviewID": "R1VWIKYYESE7YB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "These cameras are horrible.  They are listed for indoor/outdoor use.  The cameras I used indoors cameras work fine, but the cameras I used outdoors took on water almost immediately and are now totally useless to me.  I would strongly suggest any prospective purchasers look to another brand if outdoor cameras are needed.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mine System Works Fine, Happy With It", "Author": "T. Hicks \"twah\"", "ReviewID": "R1IS80ZCGSFEW0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the system even though it had a couple of negative reviews.  I had  the system installed in a property I have in Mexico a couple of months ago.  I did have it installed by a professional installer in Mexico just because I ran out of time to do it and wanted to get it operational.  I can view pictures on my computer via Internet Explorer (Google chrome is not supported) and my android phone without any problem.  At this point I am very satisfied.  The pictures are clear and motion caught without being too jerky.  I have not had any problems.I would recommend this system.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "500GB HDD, H.264 Video Compression, DVI/VGA output\nLOREX Instant Mobile Viewing on iPhone, Blackberry, Windows Mobile and other compatible 3G smart phones\nExclusive LOREX Easy Connect Internet Set-up Wizard\nEDGE design for stand alone or VESA mount (Wall & LCD)\nIncludes 4 Color Security Cameras with 60ft Extension cable for each, Flex IR Controller, Power Supply & Mouse", "Name": "Lorex Edge+ LH324501C4 4-Channel Video Security DVR with Internet, 3G Mobile Viewing and 4 Security Cameras (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mptfbzJAL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003VNKN8C"}}
