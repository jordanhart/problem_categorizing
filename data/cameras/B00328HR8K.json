For people like me who just need a camera for everyday things and not professional photography, this camera does very well. The pictures are crisp, clear, and very detailed. The iSCN is very useful since it automatically detects the type of scene and selects the most appropriate camera settings. The camera retouching tools are quite useful just in case you want to edit it a little right after the picture taking. I love the camera. It looks great and is very easy to use. Better than my last Polaroid model camera.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "crystal clear pictures! great purchase", "Author": "Jenelle", "ReviewID": "R3F8OLKQBN1K5P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is amazing! I have had a sony camera before but I recently purchased this one because I broke my other one. This camera is inexpensive for what it does. The videos work well and the pictures come out crystal clear. The camera automatically adjusts its lens to what type of lighting your trying to capture the picture in. You can edit a photo right on the camera before even uploading it to your computer. The sleek matte look makes it look like an expensive camera.

So I would recommend this camera.It also comes with the Sony PMB photo management software, which I have used with my Sony DSC-SX63 flash camcorder as well.

Having used my own for nine months, my conclusion is that some folks could take a picture with a pinhole camera and get results like Ansel Adams, and then others might possess all the high dollar gear in the world and still get pictures of their fingers, and out of focus pictures at that. Like most folks reading this, I probably fall somewhere in the middle of that grouping.So. This camera is the digital equivalent of an Instamatic, which is to say, you point and you shoot. It has a 4x optical zoom that works quite well, it has a nice bright display which accurately portrays what you will get on your finished shot, and it has lots of options you may or may not find useful; fact is, most of us will do little with it other than take what we used to call \"snapshots\". To each his own. But if you take the time to work at it, you can get some mighty fine snapshots with this piece.

Since the camera is no longer the latest model, it can now be had with a discount.  It may annoy professional photographers or nit-picky hobbyists, however. Camera is well built, extremely compact and very affordable.  The camera's computer will automatically determine the optimal settings for photos. It has image stabilization and smile detection to help capture special moments. Pictures are crisp, colorful, and can be easily reviewed on the camera's wide 2.7 inch LCD screen in gallery or slide-show modes.  Photos can be edited and retouched within the camera itself, so you can go straight to the photo store without going near a computer.If you prefer more manual control and tinkering, this may not be the camera for you, as it is designed to do most of the work, although you can change some of the automatic settings. Its ease of use is very appealing, leaving me to concentrate on the subject matter, rather than technical issues. Sleek, compact body, auto retracting wide angle lens, 4x optical zoom, image stabilization, intuitive controls, built-in utilities, adaptability, user friendliness and intelligent computer make this a great everyday photographic companion.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "In an technological age, you'd expect better", "Author": "J.

No need for a lot of features. The price point, the name brand, and the large display were the main reasons for the purchase.  The Easy Mode is especially fitting for her.  I must say, however, that I was totally disappointed with this camera after a mere few hours of experimentation.  At first I was impressed.  Compared with my other cameras (all Canon), the user interface is really well designed and easy to use.  I especially like the one-button toggle between the camera and the playback mode.  The pictures seems great on the camera display.  However, there lies the showstopper.  Once the pictures are loaded to the PC and shown on the PC monitor, they are noticeably sub-par to any point and shoot digital cameras I have ever known.  All of the pictures came across as \"seemingly aged\", as if coming from a Polaroid or a scanner. The photos are blurry and grainy as if taken using a high ISO setting. I tried all kinds of combination of settings but did not make any difference.  The subject's eye brow hair is not distinguishable with this camera, while I can see the individual hair with my other camera (specifically Canon Powershot SD800).  What's the point of having 12.1 mega pixel when it cannot take clear pictures?!

Before people say 'just make it black and white on your computer!'... I shouldnt have to.  I had a Sony a couple of models below this one that took great black and white pictures, every cell phone Ive had with a camera has a black and white option, but its absent from this model.

I looked at the picture from the LCD screen and was surprised at the graininess and blurriness of the picture when I zoomed in.  I decided to take a look on my computer hoping I was wrong but I wasn't.  The quality is awful.  I took many pictures with different settings, with and without flash, and close-up and far away pictures.  None of them looked great... well, except for a close-up picture with the iSCN setting on.  But that was all.  You might say it's the lighting in my room but I took the same pictures with my old 7.2MP cybershot and there were no blurriness or graininess.The only thing that is good about this model is that it can capture a lot of light so you don't need flash as much.It's fortunate that I tried this camera before giving it to my friend.  She's definitely not getting this, I'm returning it tomorrow.", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "The camera has screen freeze problem, but the company still charged me 15% restocking fee", "Author": "Jinmei He", "ReviewID": "R2DP5JNGD4W88C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera drove me crazy with the screen freeze problem over and over again,so I had to return it just 3 day after I got them, I even wrote a letter to the company to explainthe camera has this unbelievable problem, because the guy on the phone told me if the camera has problem,they won't charge restocking fee, but they still charged me $15, I guess no matterwhat reason you return, they would charge 15% anyway.Just stay away from this company, DataVision Computer Video. I went to Bestbuy and boughtan Olympus waterproof camera without any risk to be charged restocking fee and I can returnit in 14 days, also they matched the online price(only on bestbuy.com). Good service made a difference.By the way, I've been using Sony sybershot for many years, but this DSC-W310 is very cheap made,the back of the camera is all plastic, very cheap, and this screen freeze problem is a big headache,my old sybershot only has 7.2 MP but it is much much better and the picture is much clearer than this one.I am so disappionted that I had to switch to a different brand.", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "One GOTCHA! after another.  Paying for the Name", "Author": "JASON CASTEEL", "ReviewID": "R34MLK5IXAMIVF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This might be ok for a little kid, but even when taken out of \"Simple Mode\" it lacks the features and quality of a lower priced Panasonic or Polaroid.  Mostly things you wouldn't think to spec out before you bought.  Its almost like a bad joke, every time you want to do something really basic it's like somebody yells \"GOTCHA!\" It doesn't do that either....  I have had it about a week, and I have had it with this camera.  Specifics:  Only 8 scene modes, and only a couple are the standard useful ones.  They actually pad the number of scene modes with one that is only good when looking at blue water from a beach.  Another is only good for making food on a plate look better  (No, REALLY!)  As near as I can tell, the Macro mode only kicks on when it wants to, you can not set white balance like every $80 camera out there so your colors come out looking ridiculous, especially in \"Easy Mode\" The level of dithering in the picture makes anything you take horribly blurry when blown up just the slightest.  The batteries are not standard, and stupidly expensive ($30 to $50 each), as well as not carried widely.  The focal settings are so terrible that you have to zoom in all the way and still not be able to see something like you would see it when you look with your eyes, so you really can't count that as a zoom.  The scan rate is so slow that you get bars of light and dark when trying to photograph a computer monitor or LCD Screen such as a Cell Phone or Blackberry.  When compensating for this, the image becomes so dark and blurry as to look like a 110 camera. Then there is the pause between shots.  It just goes black in some modes for several seconds after each shot, much like an older cell-phone camera.  This was an unopened, sealed, undamaged box, with full packaging, and instructions. This review is of a camera in newly manufactured condition.  They are all like this.I would actually have to recommend Polaroid over this.  This would have been my 6th pocket digital camera, but I will have to try something else before I throw this thing against the wall in frustration.  The characteristics would have been ok for around $25-$30, like something made of plastic that you would get for a little kid, or get out of a \"crane-game\", or maybe a web-cam, but not for soemthing sold as a camera at this price point.
