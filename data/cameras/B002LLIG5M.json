I think this camera is excellent. I purchased this as a bundle at WM for under $100. This is my ebay/family use camera and it works great for both. It takes clear, crisp photos and has all kinds of different settings. As for the other complaint about bad photos in low light, most cameras in this price range don't take professional looking photos in low light if you aren't super close to the subject.One thing I really like about this camera is how it charges. Other rechargeable cameras I have had you had to remove the battery and put it on a charger. This camera's charger plugs right into the camera itself. The same cord detaches from the power adapter and plugs into the USB port of your computer to upload pictures.I highly recommend this camera!", "Date": "December 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camera", "Author": "Ashlei A.

But it hasn't lasted a year.Recently the battery wouldn't hold a charge.  I figured just the battery was bad.  Bought a new one.  Same problem.

I really like the camera, good pictures, and they printed on my copier, great.  The colors were true.  The only problem I have is that I want an extra battery as I bought a charger, and all the batteries that state they will fit the camera don't.  They are slightly larger, so the battery case doesn't close all the way.  But as far as the camera goes, it is a good one.  The only solution I see is to purchase a genuine Samsung battery from the company.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "No what I hoped for", "Author": "Janice A.

Pictures aren't bad if you have decent light but in low light they don't turn out at all.

I had to have something 10mp or higher with all the bells and whistles. This was a great price as a bundle and came with the photo card. It was easy to use and I took some great portrait shots with it and used the timer. My problem with this camera has to do with some of the features such as macro. I couldn't get a clear shot even when I switched to auto focus. Everything kept coming out blurry, especially in low light situations. Also, it won't save any of the edits to the photo when you rotate it. Why is this?? Anyone else have this problem? I've fiddled with it so many times and unfortunately it doesn't come with a good instruction manual. I'm rather disappointed and I'll probably go back to using the HP.", "Date": "January 15, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Product: Compact Digital Camera\nPixel: 12.4 Mega pixel\nFocal Length: Samsung Lens f = 6.3 ~ 31.5mm (35mm film equivalent: 35~175 mm)\nF No.: F3.5(W) ~ F5.5(T)\nDigital Zoom: Still Image mode: 1.0X ~ 5.0X Play mode: 1.0X ~ 10.2X (depends on image size)", "Name": "Samsung 12MP Dig Camera 5X Opt 3IN LCD Silver", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IfMl2WgjL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002LLIG5M"}}
