It seems they all have a hard time with the color green like trees, shrubs etc. Up close it is fine but 5 feet away or more, green is now purple. Software adjustments make no difference. The housing is nice and first visual impression is good until you hook it up. Would I buy another? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes, but don't expect great color, but video is nice and clear.I purchased a second one and Amazon does not allow you to post more then one review on an item. The second one arrived, hooked it up and plugged it in... that's when the smoke started seeping out of the power supply. Needles to say, it does not work and is being returned. The first one I purchased is still working the same as when I got it, so I figured what the heck, get another one since I needed it to replace an IP camera. The first one is sitting out in the weather in south Georgia. The rain and heat has not affected it so they are seal really well. Since Amazons policy for this item is refund only I will be ordering another one.Well here we are again.... The second one, or replacement for the second one arrived today. Plugged it in and yup, you guessed it, smoke came poring out of the power cube. I GIVE UP...... WILL LOOK FOR OTHER SOLUTIONS!!!!", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "day/night vision camera", "Author": "Raypa", "ReviewID": "R3VN6P3O83N79L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "packaging and delivery are A1, I ordered 4 camera. 3 are still A1 but the 3rd has a problem.
