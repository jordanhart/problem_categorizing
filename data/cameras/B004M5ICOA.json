Plugging it into my Netbook was a breeze using the USB cable or using my flash drive.The Samsung Photo Software was not compatible with my HP Netbook running XP.  My Larger HP Notebook ran the software and it catalouges my many phone photos, still photo scans, and scanned documents.  The only weakness is the inability of the software run on systems less than Vista.This brand new model PL20 I found to be roughly comparable to a Nikon Coolpix.  The Samsung is quicker than the Nikon and the New Lithium Battery pack has a longer battery life the a Nikon using AA batteries.Extras I am looking to buy are not yet available on Amazon including a Samsung case for the PL20 and additional lithium ion battery pack.", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good choice", "Author": "Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R17WOTH6Z6CHUS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good value for what I paid.
