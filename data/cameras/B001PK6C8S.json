Randall \"Meg R\"", "ReviewID": "R1SG4RT5OGC5PB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first turned on the camera and started taking pictures, I too noticed the grainy quality of the pictures.  Then I started reading the manual!  What a great idea, huh?  It has different \"scenes\" in which you can choose whatever current situation you are in while taking the picture.  If you press the scene button, you can select up to 18 different scenes in which to take your pictures.  You can choose anything from museum (no flash)and sporting events, to candlelight/parties and fireworks!  All you need to do is select what's right for the situation you're in.  You can also select auto scene where the camera will automatically select which scene it thinks you're in.  This is a great camera!!  I love being able to turn my photos to black & white and sepia, and write little notes on them.  You can also record messages to go with your pictures!  I love the large touch screen, and being able to touch-up the pictures directly on the camera!  Bottom line is, if you know how to use the camera, you shouldn't have a problem, and you'll most likely love it just as much as I do!", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Strong compact camera with quality pictures", "Author": "Iceman", "ReviewID": "R1WGRRX1663WV2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my daughter to replace a beat up 5MP pocket camera (Samsung) that used batteries up like no tomorrow. It was a competent little camera but it was time for an upgrade for her. At 16 years old it was time for her to have an update for taking snapshots of family and friends and to give her the ability to document our many family vacations. I own a Nikon DSLR that is up in the 1,000 to 2k dollar range and it gets frequent use and has been quite durable. The issue with it is size. This camera is no where near as advanced as my DSLR but it is quite competent for a camera in its price range.For those critics out there who have had issues with picture quality READ THE OWNERS MANUAL!! This is a very easy camera to use right out of the box but to get the most out of it you need to choose the right mode for the type of photo you are taking. It seems many are reporting grainy photos or problems with image quality. We have never seen that with this camera. It is small, has a decent lens with a rechargeable battery and takes SDHC memory which allows larger capacity SD memory cards. I was able to pair this camera with a 8gb SDHC memory card I found for 18.00. That will give this camera the ability to take well over 500 photos.I picked this camera up for 200.00 and I feel its a good value for that price with the touchscreen, rechargeable battery, good lens and solid build quality. If you don't want to read the manual and take a little time getting familiar with the many features of the camera then move on. Reading is fundamental!

It's so easy to shoot with this little pocket camera, and so guiltless. Easy to use, small and convenient. I have no issues with the image quality. Then again, I know what the high end looks like, so maybe my expectations are more reasonable.

Love it", "Author": "saugus32", "ReviewID": "R1ZYUK5NR0HKLM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I may have not bought my Nikon Coolpix S230 (Plum) On Amazon but I love mine.  I did my reviews to choice between Nikon/Kodak/Samsung.  Trust me I wanted Samsung badley as it had display view front/back, but the price was just too high for me to afford.  I found my Nikon in BJ Wholesale store under $200.00, which price at the store and on line said for $189, but I only paid at the register $169. I bought it home, charged the battery, took some test picture of my cat, my husband, printed it and I was amazed how clear, crisp and bright the pictures were, even in the room with no lights hardley can be seen of my cat.  The reason I bought this camera is we are going to the football game and since our seat is in a great spot, I wanted a camera where I didn't have to do much with, except turn it on, zoom in if I had to and take picture and I found this camera has and will do this for me.  Also, I can take as many pictures I want and I can at the same time I can view it, delete it right on the spot.  Love it, love it and I am so glad I got it.  I am not a photographer my all mean, but when I look for cameras, I look MP/Optical Zoom and length of the LCD, and I got everything in this camera. I now know I made the right choice for touch screen I wanted.Try it and I know you will like it as I know I am glad I got it and thrilled with it.", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "M.

I think those who are complaining about blury pics are not using the camera correctly.  You do need to play with settings on any camera to have the correct lighting, object, etc settings so you can take the optimum pic.  Although it is a point and shoot, it does have several features and functions that make it great, but apparently have turned some people off.  It also means that some will not take the time to change the settings after opening the box.  It's unfortunate because this is one of the few cameras I tried that took quick clear pics of my 1 and 3 year olds.  Hopefully people will take a chance on this camera because it is a great camera!", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "A great compact camera", "Author": "flower \"rain\"", "ReviewID": "R3VKJL83LYYCH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted one small, light and good looking.

I searched high and low, visited many different stores, browsed online. You name it, I did it. Finally I came across this nifty touchscreen camera. It came in four different colors, and seemed pretty durable. I read the reviews and I second-guessed myself from purchasing it. Half the reviews were really good and half were really bad. So I decided to go against the bad reviews and try it out for myself. The camera is so easy to use. The touchscreen (which is plastic) is great. It doesnt leave behind finger prints or anything! And there's no glare which is nice. People complained how cheap that is... but it makes the camera nice, and light-weight! Anyhow, next complaint was POOR picture quality. All you need to do is change the ISO and ta-da, no more grainy pics. The features are endless on it! You can totally edit your pics right on the camera, add cute little frames and stamps and even doodle on pics. Its a lot of fun! And a heck of a lot cheaper than other touchscreen cameras I came across. Read the manual, and once you know how this cool camera works, I promise, you will be SO happy with it.

We've been playing around with it and seeing all it's features for the past two weeks.The features on this camera are unbeatable and for 10 MP, it's a great price. There's some cool features like \"smile\" mode. The camera detects when your subject is smiling and will take the shot for you. It also has a great feature called \"blink\" mode. The camera can detect if someone is blinking, will ask you to check before it saves to the camera. Or you can just take another one to be sure. The picture quality is great. Some seem slightly grainy on the 3\" LCD screen but once you upload them to your computer they're fine. It has a few modification options to change your pictures, ie. Black & White, Sepia Tone, Vivid Color, etc. My other favorite feature, which was not talked about anywhere is the \"Panorama\" mode. The camera assists you in placement of pictures to help you take a panoramic picture. And you can take as many as you want! The touch screen is really cool also. Oh, and it takes video!To sum it all up...this is a great camera. And at a great price.

So I got this camera to take quick pics when I go out and when I don't want to take my expensive camera since I am paranoid about damaging it. Also S230 has ability to take  videos up to 30 min. Great thing in my opinion. About grainy pictures - yes, they will be grainy if you are shooting in a poorly lit room since camera adjusts its ISO way up. Guess what my DSLR would do exact same thing if I were to crank my ISO to 1600, but I don't do it and I use flash and longer exposure to produce better looking pics. Exact same thing can be achieved with this camera if you were to take a picture with a night portrait mode.

I DID MY RESEARCH READ THE REVIEWS WATCH THE VIDEO REVIEWS AND ALL THAT STUFF BUT NOTHING SEEMS TO EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT THE REALITY OF HAVING ONE OF IT...LETS TALK ABOUT THE PICTURE QUALITY ...  YES IT HAS GOOD PICTURE QUALITY BUT NOT EXCELLENT I WILL RATE IT AS A 4 STAR ... ABOUT THESE PEOPLE THAT WAS SAYING IT HAS A BAD PICTURE >>> BUBBLY,SANDY,GRAINY AND ALL THAT... THEY ARE ALSO TRUE !!! THEY ARE SOME PICTURE THAT ARE ACTUALLY GRAINY BLURRED AND A CELLPHONE-LIKE PHOTO'S ... BUT YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT SETTING FOR IT FOR THE RIGHT SITUATION AND LOCATION - LIKE INDOORS/PARTY AND STUFF, NIGHT-PHOTO SHOTS, THE BACKGROUND LIGHTING, AND ALL THAT STUFF. ABOUT THE NIGHT SHOTS I WILL CONSIDER IT AS AN EXCELLENT NIGHT SHOOTER THE PICTURE IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS WHEN THE SUN IS UP WELL OF COURSE THE CLOSER THE TARGET IS THE BETTER... CLOSE UP PICTURES ARE ALSO FAIR... BUT IT WILL BE ON ITS BEST ON ABOUT 3-5 FEET ON A SUNLIGHT SITUATION OR EVEN FARTHER... DONT GET FOOLED ABOUT THE MEGA PIXELS IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU SET YOUR CAMERA ON ITS MAXIMUM PICTURE SIZE IT MEANS THAT YOU WOULD GET THE BEST PICTURE QUALITIES - TAKE NOTE THAT MORE STEADY HANDS CAN TAKE MORE BETTER QUALITY PICTURESQUALITY PICTURES - YOU CAN GET THAT ON THE TYPE OF THE CAMERA LENSES... OF COURSE THE BETTER LENS THE BETTER PICTURE OUTPUT ... AND ON THIS CAMERA NIKON S230, THE PICTURE IS JUST FAIR THE PRICE I'D PAYED FOR IS JUST MATCHES THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT...

MONEY WISE QUALITY WISE ...ABOUT THE PHYSICAL QUALITY OF THE CAMERA,  THE CAMERA IS LIGHT AND ITS EVEN LIGHTER THAN MY BLACKBERRY CURVE (CELLPHONE) SOME PEOPLE LIKE IT HEAVY AND AS SOLID AS POSSIBLE AND SOME LIKE IT LIGHT .. LIKE ME I WOULD LIKE IT HEAVIER THAN WHAT IT IS ANYWAY THE RATINGS ARE ALSO FAIR THE DESIGN IS NICE ITS COMPACT SMALL AND CUTE 5 STAR ON THATADVICE - WHATS GOOD AND WHATS NOT  IF YOU ARE THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT JUST WANT TO POINT AND SHOT THIS IS NOT FOR YOU THIS CAMERA WILL BE MORE APPRECIATED IF YOU FIND THE RIGHT SETTING FOR THE RIGHT SITUATION AND LOCATION ...

I bought it before moving to a Pacific island and boy was I wrong.  It does horrible with sunlight, leaving vertical streaks through the pictures.  The video quality is also bad, especially if you're outside with sun - again, vertical streaks everywhere.  I could talk about the positive features, but unfortunately if it doesn't take good pictures, it's not worth it.  I have played with all the options and read the entire manual to try to overcome these problems, but it's just a crappy camera.  I have experience with much better cameras in the past, and feel my cellphone can do better that this camera.The video I'm attaching to this is taken in Washington State.  You can see the horrible effect the sun has on the image.

I was apprehensive buying a telescoping lens camera as I have heard so much about these lenses jamming or malfunctioning but the price was great and Nikon is a good brand name. First thing I noticed was that it came with a battery charger. OK, that's something else we will have to pack, can I charge it off the USB cable to the laptop? NO. You cant charge it via USB. Not even a trickle charge. Wait, thats not even a USB port, its a proprietary socket that the Nikon cable fits into. I guess micro USB cant do what this A/V out cable can do. OK, well move on..Started snapping pics. They look nice, not real grainy indoors, great outdoors. Turned off flash and zoomed in on a church choir, grainy as heck. Must have been the digital zoom on top of no flash which would have been out of range anyway. The high ISO they claim seems to introduce alot of grain as expected. And as for blurry motion shots, I have plenty. Either we are not using the sports mode or this camera doesnt really have that good of a sensor? OK, so it was only $60 off a surplus web site and it did have that cool touch screen so I think as bad as it is, its actually pretty good for $60. The touch screen comes with a little stylus that ties to the lanyard. The stylus makes using the touch screen bearable as your big fingers are pretty clunky on that little 3 inch screen. As for durability, The case is plastic and the chassis seems to be metal as there is some weight to it, but I dropped it from literally 2 feet off my lap to a tiled floor and sure enough I cracked the touch screen overlay, rendering it stuck on the last mode it was in as the touch screen is now unresponsive, its done. I dropped that Metal Sony DSC-1 from 5 feet and it only bounced and hit again and sustained no catastrophic damage. So the camera is not bad in my opinion for $60. It is bad for $200 though as you can get a tough camera from other makers that is much sturdier without the telescoping lens for about the same retail price.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "So Disappointed!!!", "Author": "Sharon Little", "ReviewID": "R1UVTYHTNMNLPW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a previous Nikon Coolpix camera in Europe and loved it.

Auto mode, which is seriously the bread and butter of any small, portable camera like this, is completely worthless. I'm not just talking about auto scene mode either, I'm talking about auto flash. Every photo I shot using auto-scene didn't come out properly, and part of that problem is the auto-focus.  Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what it's trying to focus on most of the time.  I'd go to shoot an Easter basket, it'd focus on the couch next to the basket.  I'd go to shoot my child reading a book, it'd focus on the carpet he's sitting on. I'm saavy enough to know that once the camera focuses, you can move it to put the green box over what you really want to focus on (as long as the depth is the same), but that never helped/worked.  Every photo wasn't as crisp/sharp as I would have expected.Auto-flash is just as bad. I'm indoors, at dusk, so it's not that bright, and the flash won't go off.  I'm down the basement, taking photos of the dogs, and the flash won't go off.  At first I gave the camera the benefit of the doubt and assumed it knew what it was doing, but all the photos came out dark and blurry.All the reviews say to use the scenes instead, so I started doing that.  Well, there is no scene for \"I'm just shooting photos indoors\", that's called \"auto mode\".  I did try various scenes while I was outside, and those photos came out better, but seriously, the whole point of auto mode is so you don't have to think about the composition of every photo. If I wanted to do that, I'd use my DSLR (and even then, sometimes auto mode is the easiest thing on that).I'm completely unimpressed with this camera.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, because if you can hit upon a photo you want to take that the scene mode takes care of, it's not horrible.  However for something that's horrendously easy to use with little thought, go with a Canon.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Picture Quality Surprise", "Author": "Lori Pitsas", "ReviewID": "R212RAIL005105", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this Camera for my birthday back in October and was exited to get to use it.

I tried taking several pictures right out of the box on auto-mode and found the image quality to be worse than my first digital camera that I bought back in 1995.

I tried taking pictures on each of the scene settings, and still found that the image quality was terrible (some worse than others).

I went with the Canon Powershot SD780 IS instead and love it!", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Don't buy it!", "Author": "Dan@Peru \"Dan\"", "ReviewID": "RFGHG55UT1HK7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "when I saw this item, S230; I thought it was like S225 but with touchscreen. It turned out to be similar to S220, which is together with this one a waste of money. Pictures taken are usually blur, or have lots of back-light dots. Auto mode is really crappy :S:S:S totally dissatisfied with it. Thought for being a Nikon it'd have been a better product. Couldn't be more wrong. For less price I can get a Casio that does much better with less money.

We had a sony that was 7 years old and wanted a compact one to carry in the diaper bags. I took it out of the box and charged the battery but the pitcure quality was awful. Very grainy and can see the pixles. Seems like there was more input into the color and touch screen then the actual quality of the photo. We even downloaded the pictures to the computer and the quality was still awful. My husbands blackberry took better quality of photos than this camera. The camera can be deciving because my husband looked at it in the store and took photos in the store which came out okay. However in dim light and night photos, don't expect to get good pictures. So we returned it and got a sony cybershot and let me tell you the pictures were crystal clear. To rate the differences in cameras: the nikon is a  0% and sony 100%. When I buy a camera, I want good quality photos and could careless about a touch screen, etc. (The sony did have more features than the nikon, except for touch screen.", "Date": "August 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bad Quality", "Author": "Amy L.

Since he lacks any working experience with digital cameras, he based his selection on what he thought I would want:  cute design, \"girly\" color, large touch-screen operation and 10 or more megapixels.  While this camera has all of those characteristics, it's lacking a few other ones that are more important, like more than 3x optical zoom and better image stabilization.The pros: I love all of the preset modes--you can select the type of environment you're in (such as Museum, Fireworks, Sunset and more) to get the optimum settings for lighting, shutter speed and color.  Even though I haven't had much chance to use it, I also love the Panoramic Picture setting.  I tried it out the first night in our new apartment and it was a great way to take a shot of our entire living room and dining room to email out to family.  Can't wait to try this out somewhere a little more scenic!  Overall the camera is extremely easy to use and the large touch screen makes seeing and selecting things simple.The cons:  The pictures tend to be very grainy, no matter the distance.  The camera claims to have a 3x optical zoom, but my 5+ year old Sony Cybershot that cost half the amount and half the megapixels of this Nikon takes nearly the same quality.  The included software has some nice features, but again, I think the software I got from Sony is a little better.  Also don't like that this camera has a rechargeable battery--can be inconvenient when traveling or at long events when a power outlet is not an option.Overall, I like this camera and think it looks great.  I just wish that my boyfriend would have taken me shopping to let me chose my own camera, as I would have focused more on the technical specs of the camera than the aesthetics of it.", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "The best camera!!!", "Author": "Camila M.

If I had only known how they were made I never would have bought one.  The lens is a piece of junk and just stops working for no apparent reason.  Two of the three had this problem.  I sent both of the cameras off under warranty.  What a hassle, Nikon sucks!!!They honored one under warranty and six weeks later they returned that camera.  The other one they demanded the receipt and we could not find it.  They want $ 108 to fix THEIR defect on a camera that retails at $ 145.  The camera has been at Nikon repair for months now, I don't think it will ever leave that place.  They refuse to stand behind their product, I refuse to ever have anything to do with them.The camera that did come back lasted less than one week.  My daughter took it with her on a class trip and put it in her backpack.  When she went to get the camera out of the backpack the touch screen was cracked.  The weight of other backpacks cracked that.  No use sending that into their warranty department...  they will never honor that.The third camera was dropped by my son while running on the driveway and is horribly scratched, ironically despite the cosmetic scratches that is the only one that has work perfectly.So, a lens that is defective, a touch screen that cannot stand normal wear and tear, built by a company that fails to stand behind their product.
