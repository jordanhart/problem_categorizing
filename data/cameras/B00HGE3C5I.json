The impressive (24-1200 mm) 50x zoom, DSLR styling, 3\" articulated LCD, weather sealing, 3-stop image stabilization, extra features like Panorama and HDR modes, and HD video quality (with High Speed modes) are what I feel its greatest draws. Keep in mind that performance from the S1 will not be that of a true DSLR.My older bridge camera that I've enjoyed using for many years is the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ50. The FinePix S1 compares favorably to it. While I basically find them close in general performance and image quality, the S1 is usually at least as good -- or even much better in some cases. The S1 is a lighter and more compact camera with more shooting and customization options. While I won't get rid of my FZ50, the S1 will likely replace it as a go-to camera for general use. The main thing I would miss from the FZ50 is the manual zoom control on the lens.S1 Pros:1. Small and light for a superzoom2. 50x stabilized (fast) optical zoom3. Articulated high DPI rear LCD4. Wi-Fi connectivity and control5. 16MP sensor (1/2.3 backlit)6. 1cm macro mode7. Respectable battery life8. Great ergonomics for the most part9. Images showcase the great Fujifilm color balances10. Fast power on and offS1 Cons:1. The 1/.23 sensor gets noisy at higher ISOs and overall image quality just decent2. The EVF is okay but not great, and doesn't have an eye sensor like that on the Fujifilm X-S13. Plasticey construction materials and awkward USB and HDMI port cover4. No manual zoom or focus5. Somewhat high price point at launch6. No lens shade or separate charger included. Lens shade and filter adapter are extras and cost a fair bit of $.7. Not quite as compact as some other super zoom offerings8. Memory card resides in the battery compartment which is blocked when using a tripod shoe9. Gear noise while zooming during video recording is somewhat intrusiveThe S1 is an all-in-one camera that can handle just about anything you throw at it; including sports, nature, macro, scenic and portrait photography. It handles much the way a typical DSLR camera would with the obvious advantage of not having to lug around a variety of lenses for different applications. While good in most situations, image quality could be better. However given the lens/sensor combo, it really does a good job, especially in the mid-zoom range. The S1 takes great video and offers RAW format for additional flexibility. I've test the camera's movie taking aspect and while you get a bit of mechanical noise if you want to zoom in and out, the results are almost as good as any digital videocamera I've used. In many ways it has most of the features of both a DSLR *AND* a video camera in one compact and user-friendly package. While I've not used it long, battery life seems good for a camera in this class. If I were taking it out all day as my only camera, I'd bring a back-up battery. You may want to get an external charger for convenience sake when purchasing a spare battery. Make sure you have plenty of fast memory (I recommend at least one 64GB SDHC card). I've had no problems downloading images and video to my older home iMac running OSX 10.5.8 (Leopard). I've yet to try out the Wi-Fi but will update this review when I do.Fujifilm's FinePix S1 is a very capable, feature packed \"do-it-all\" super-zoom camera that should satisfy a lot of people's needs. Discerning pixel-peepers might be let down by the image noise at ISO speeds 400 and above, but for a bridge camera in its class, the S1 performs admirably. While it may look like a DSLR, it certainly isn't. As a general use super-zoom bridge camera for the casual user I give it 5 stars. Factoring in other bridge camera aspects and comparing it to the competition, I'd give it 3. I'm rounding it up to 4 stars because it shines in some key areas even though it drops the ball in others.Edited: 04/10/2014Edit: 04/13/2014 - I had some issues with the zoom not working on my camera after a couple of weeks of use, and when I contacted Fujifilm, they were very responsive and over-nighted me a new camera. So far the new one is performing well, so it may have just been a glitch in the other unit. Time will tell. Than you Fuji for your customer focused service!Edit: 05/01/2014 - I've just noticed some odd banding issues with the 2nd camera when photographing in HDR mode. I don't see it in every photo I take in that mode, but I noticed that when shooting a flat surface in somewhat low light, some odd linear bands appear on the images. At first I thought they were due to light coming in though the window blinds, but I shot the same image in a different mode and they disappeared. I'll post sample images when I have the opportunity.~ Kort", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cool features but I prefer the Canon's image quality", "Author": "S. Power", "ReviewID": "R15TAUJUGV7O4M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera seemed like it was going to be an improvement over our Canon PowerShot SX50 HS 12MP Digital Camera with 2.8-Inch LCD (Black) because of its added features and higher pixel count.  In reality, I still prefer the Canon for its much better picture quality.The ability to use this camera with your smart phone is cool and useful.  For some people, who like to post everything they take immediately on social media sites, this might be enough reason to get it.  Being able to use your camera as a remote control for it, is also pretty cool.  For anyone that is used to using the newer GoPro cameras with your tablet or smart phone, this has similar functionality.The 50 power zoom is the same as our Canon overs and works just as well.  The lens on this camera is great, and is about equal to that on the Canon.The thing that I don't like about this Fujifilm camera is the image quality.  The image sensor seems like it should be on a $200 point and shoot, not something that is just a step away from a DSLR.  Several of my pictures came out grainy and others were noisy.  For such an expensive camera, I'd expect better.  For me to lug something this big (compared to a point and shoot or a smart phone) around, it needs to take a lot better pictures than this does.", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "There Is A Lot To LIke; It's A Keeper", "Author": "Kenneth Depree", "ReviewID": "RYJ9XQ50MMI5J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "April 21/14 addition:1.  The default color setting is FinepixCOLOR: Std (for standard).  If you think a little more saturation will help your photos, open the menu, scroll down to FinepixCOLOR,  click on it, then choose \"Chrome\" from the list.  This will increase the saturation, but not to an excessive degree. It is good to have this option since tastes differ.2.  If you expect to be using this camera in wet weather, take a look at the Lowepro Nova 140AW camera bag.  It is a good size for this camera, even with a lens hood on, but more important, it is  well protected from the rain.  Lowepro is known for making good camera cases, and generally they come with a rain cover, but what sets this camera apart is that you can open the case when the cover is on.  The  small pockets on front of the flap and on the sides of the case are covered, the the main compartment, where the camera is kept, can be opened and closed with ease.Original:The Finepix S1 is not my first camera.  I am an advanced intermediate and have owned a number of them.  In addition to the S1, my present cameras are a Canon 60d dslr, a Canon SX280, my travel and walk around camera, a Canon camcorder, and now the S1.I know that regardless of what else a camera does the most important is taking good photos.  The S1 meets that test, so far I am very satisfied with the clarity and quality of the photos.  The S1 is a keeper.For the past couple of days I have been \"playing\" with the S1, experimenting with many of its offerings.  I would like to share some of my findings and impression in this review.Zoom:  All I can say is wow!  I can think of many times in the past when I would have loved to have this camera in my hands.  I took the Finepix  S1, the Canon 60d with a 70-300 mm lens, and the Canon  SX280 point and shoot with a 20X lens to the harbor to photograph a boat at anchor quite a long way out.  It was not even close.  The Faststone image viewer that I use reported that the focal length of the shot with the 60d was 70mm (this is not the 35mm equivalent, which would be a higher number); the focal length of the little SX280 was 90mm; and the focal length of the S1 was 215mm.  A huge difference, and it was obvious when you compared the photos.Normally I rely only on optical zoom, but for this test I turned on the digital zoom available on the S1.  It is said this almost doubles the default 50X to 100X, and I could see that  in the photos.  With the 50X the boat was close, with digital zoom turned on, it looked like I could step on the deck.All the photos from the 3 cameras were clear and usable, but the S1 100X photos with the digital zoom turned on were not as sharp as the others.  I can spruce them up in post processing, but out of the camera the photos at S1 50X were noticeably sharper.To get a close up of the distant boat equal to the S1 zoomed to 50X with the much more  expensive 60d with 70-300mm lens would require a lens of enormous length and cost, and so heavy it would have to always to be supported by a tripod.It should also be mentioned that the S1 makes it easy to zoom out when you are shooting.  There is a lever around the shutter button that you operate with your right hand, this is common on many cameras, but on the S1 there is also a lever on the other side that can easily be operated by your left hand.  This makes it possible to keep the shutter half-way down to focus with your right hand while you zoom out or in with your left hand.  This is a very nice feature.  It also works very well when shooting video.Image Stabilization:  I was impressed with how clear and sharp the photos were even though I was not braced when I took the photos. The S1 compensated very well for my shakiness.  That is good for the confidence when using the camera.Vari-angle LCD:  The S1 uses 920K dots, which gives you a very clear view in good color of what you are shooting, if your preference is to focus using the screen.  Most companies use a lower resolution display to help keep the cost down.It is important to know that for shooting \"P\", \"S\", \"A\", and \"M\" the menu (image size) gives you the option of 4 aspect ratios: 4:3 (default), 16:9, 3:2 and 1:1.  4:3 and 16:9 are the most commonly used.  If you choose 16:9, what you see on the screen will be different than what you see if you choose 4:3. The scene if you choose 16:9 is less high in relation to width than 4:3, so what you see on the screen has a black bar at top and bottom to fill the space left by the reduction in height.  The image you see if you choose 4:3 fills the screen.  The black that you see with 16:9 does not appear in the image you upload/print.  If the black bar bothers you,  this feature will be considered by you as a negative.  But I like it because I can see exactly what I will get when I upload/print the photo. (Think of it as something like what happens when you anchor the left side of a piece of stretchy material and pull on the ride side.  As the material stretches, it gets narrower.  Same amount of material, but it looks wider and narrower.)(If the sun seems too bright to use the LCD monitor, you can use the viewfinder.  However, the S1 does have a setting for the LCD monitor for bright, sunny days, but that should be used only on days that it is really needed because it uses a lot of battery juice.)Viewfinder:  My preference is the viewfinder; the SX280 is the only photo camera I have owned that did not have a view finder, so I have seen a lot of them.  I can say with certainty that the viewfinder of the S1, which also uses 920K dots, is the best I have used both in terms of the area covered and the clarity and brightness of the scene to be photographed. One negative is that color you see in the viewfinder is somewhat washed out (this is not true of the LCD monitor), but that is not how the photos will look. For some, another negative is the the scene seen through the viewfinder does completely fill the window in the same way that it does the LCD monitor.  There is a wide black line around the window like a frame.  This does not bother me, but it does some.Panorama:  You turn this on from the mode dial.  I have done panoramas before, but never so easily.  Up to now I always had to take overlapping photos then stitch them together with software.  S1, however, does the work for you.  The defaults are 120 degrees swinging camera to the right, but you can change them to swing to  the left and/or 160 or 180 degrees if you prefer.  To make the panorama, press the shutter, then immediately lift your finger, and while holding the camera in place turn your body in the indicated direction.  Both on the screen and in the viewfinder you will see a white line move across the screen.  When it gets to the end, it will stop automatically.  If you press the shutter while this line is moving, you will end the panorama and nothing will be recorded  So press, but do not hold down the shutter button.  You can experiment with speed of moving your body, just don't  go too slow.(You are better able to keep the camera level if you rotate your body than if you try to rotate the camera.)When I checked the panoramas on the Faststone photo viewer I found they were of good quality, but they were \"thinner\" so to speak than what I was seeing in the view finder.  For  example, when making a panorama of the condominium where I live, I could see the sky in the viewfinder.  However, the photo had part of the roof of the 3-story buildings cut off.  Taking another, I pointed the camera a little higher and ended up with  the view I wanted.But I soon found that you don't have to wait to know if you got the panorama you wanted.  When the white line has crossed the screen, the result shows briefly on the LCD monitor or in the view finder, so you can tell right away whether a retake is needed.You also have the option of making panoramas in the traditional way: take overlapping photos and stitch them together with a software program like Canon's PhotoStitch.  With my other cameras, this was my only option.Advanced Mode:  Another option on the mode dial, besides all the the usual and panorama, is what they call \"advanced\" but is actually good for all users.  Choose it and you are offered several options include \"pro low-light\", which is good for shooting in low light; \"natural, where 2 photos are taken of the same thing, one with flash  and one without; \"zoom bracketing\", where 3 shots are taken, 1 regular and 2 that are cropped to different degrees, giving you 3 options to choose from; and HDR where 3 photos are taken at different exposures and put together by the camera so that you get a photo that shows the whole range of exposure.All of these options work well and I'm sure I will use them all on occasion.Continuous Shooting (sometimes called burst mode):  You activate this by pressing a button on the top of the camera.  There are 3 options, high, medium and low, which can be read as very fast, a little less fast, and the slowest of the 3.  Whichever you chose, you will get about 9 shots while you press the shutter button.  High will give you 9 shots at about 10 fps, medium gives 9 shots at about 5 fps, and low is 9 shots at 3 fps.  It is important to know this so you can chose the setting best for you at the time.  If you are shooting a sports event and certain you can anticipate the crucial moment, then use \"high\" to get 9 shots of that moment to choose from.  If less certain, then chose medium or low because the 9 shots will be spread over more seconds.Which ever you choose, it takes about 4 seconds for the camera to clear so you can shoot another burst.Exposure Compensation: With other cameras, I have tended to rely on post processing to make corrections in the exposure. This worked well with the dslr cameras because I was shooting RAW. With point and shoot cameras shooting .jpeg, it was not as satisfactory. But I didn't use the exposure compensation on those cameras because it seemed like too much work and took too much time to open the menus, scroll to find exposure compensation and make the change needed to photograph a very bright, very dark, or high contrast subject. The S1 makes it easy. Press the exposure compensation button on the top of the camera, the exposure compensation indicator will appear at the bottom of the monitor or viewfinder. Then while looking at the lcd monitor or through the viewfinder, use your thumb to rotate the dial between the movie button and the mode dial. As you rotate the dial, a yellow dot will move over the indicator, either increasing or reducing exposure, and you can see the scene or subject getting lighter or darker. When it looks right, take the photo, which when uploaded to your computer or printer will look just like it did on the screen when you took the shot. To check this out, I photographed scenes and subjects with no compensation, then photographed the same scenes and subjects after dialing in some compensation. In every case, the compensated photo was better and looked just like I expected from seeing it on the monitor before taking the shot.  It is so easy to do, there really is no excuse for not making a correction before pressing the shutter button if it looks like the photo will be too dark or too light.  To illustrate, I have uploaded  before compensation and after compensation images so you can see what a difference a little compensation makes.  In this case only  +0.67.  Look in the gallery.AE Bkt (Exposure Bracketing):  Another way to manage exposure compensation that some may prefer is AE Bkt, one of the options that becomes available when you  press the button for continuous shooting.  Press the button and you get 5 options:  Continuous shooting high, medium, low, best frame capture, and AE Bkt.  Using the \"selector button\" on the back of the camera scroll to AE Bkt and press \"Ok\".  When you take your shot, the camera will take 3 images: 0 exposure compensation, +0.33 and -0.33.  At your leisure, you can pick the one you think is best.  If you think more compensation might be needed, press the  exposure compensation button and follow the instruction above to chose 0.67 or 1.0, either plus or minus.  Then when you take your shot the camera will follow your instructions when taking the 3 photos, for example 0 compensation, +0.67 and -0>67.  +0.33/-0.33 is the default setting, however, if you expect to be mostly using 0.67 or 1.00 exposure compensation, you can change the default setting.Camera Body:  According to Fujifilm, it is safe to use this camera in the rain or dusty conditions because 70 areas of the body have been sealed. This sets the S1 apart from the other bridge cameras and is especially important to me because my son and I are booked on a cruise to Alaska the first week in June and they say there is a lot of wet weather there.  I will update this review when I get back and report if I got all the shots and video that I wanted even though it meant shooting in the rain,But the weather resistance is not the only thing that impresses me about the S1 body.  It looks like a serious mid-range dslr yet is aesthetically pleasing with molded curves and rubberized matt black finish.  In your hand it feels sold, like it would withstand a few knocks, but fits comfortably with a nice molded indentation for your middle finger and a rubberized patch on the back for your thumb.  Also, the dials and buttons are well placed and easy to use.  Once you get acquainted with them, which takes some practice as well as trial and error, you will be able make many adjustments with little difficulty as the need arises.All in all, this is a very nice camera.  It takes good photos and video; looks professional; has a lot of shooting options for photos and video, such as filters, panorama, HDR, red-eye removal, up to 10 face-detection, and interval shooting; built in WiFi; a very long zoom; and sealing that enables shooting on bad-weather days.In the box is an abbreviated manual that gives setup instructions, but there is a full user manual on the CD.  I highly recommend that you download it.  The user manual is good, but you will still need to play around with camera to make full use of many of the options.  More than a little of what I have told you above was not in the manual, but discovered through use of the camera.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice \"walk around\" camera.", "Author": "William A. Nolan \"freeholder\"", "ReviewID": "R2WFG5L29HL2BU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me begin by saying that I have been a professional photographer for about 45 years, and I teach digital photography/Photoshop at the college level.  I have several cameras, ranging from very compact point and shoot models to larger DSLR cameras.  This Fuji camera is what I call a bridge model, or sometimes a prosumer camera.  It is more compact than a DSLR, and does not have a removable lens, but it has the features and controls you would expect to find on the larger (and more expensive) cameras.  I will discuss features first, and then the performance.  From my point of view, it has the aperture priority, shutter priority, and program modes which comprise most of my shooting.  An interesting addition is the SRAUTO mode (scene recognition).  Here the camera examines the field and picks an appropriate scene mode.  It even adjusts for a moving subject.  The camera also has the standard AUTO setting, which I typically avoid.  (The textbook for my photography classes is titled Beyond Auto Mode.)If you choose ADV (advanced) on the mode dial, you can then choose from several interesting modes, including HDR, low light, filters, and something called zoom bracketing, where the camera will take three exposures at three different zoom levels.  The mode dial also has an SP (scene position) setting, which selects one of the built in scene modes.  You pick which one and assign it to this position.  The PANORAMA setting on the dial lets you move the camera in a complete circle and then stitches the result into a panorama, which must be at least 120 degrees of the circle, or 1/3 of the way around.  There are also Manual and Custom settings on the dial.  The other controls on the top of the camera are the on/off, +/- exposure, and a button to select high speed shooting modes.  The camera is able to shoot 10 frames a second.  I do a lot of nature photography, and the multiple frames per second is really a help when capturing fast moving subjects.  On the back are controls for flash, macro, timer, an assignable function, menu, viewing of photos, and wifi, to talk to their camera app, which I haven\u2019t done.  The camera is 16 MP, and with a 16Gig card it will store about 2,000 photos before the card is full.  The battery charges internally only with the supplied charger, so you can\u2019t charge one battery while using another.  The charger is interchangeable with my Kindle and Galaxy S3 chargers, though, and has an interchangeable plug.  I assume adapters are available to use overseas.  So far I have been impressed with the photo quality.  It has a superzoom lens which goes from a 35mm equivalent of 24mm to 1200mm, or wide angle to 24 power.  It will focus at 1 cm for macro work.  The image stabilization gives 3 stops improvement, so hand holding it at max zoom was no problem, and I got no blur from camera shake.  Keep in mind that I\u2019m a pro, and your results may vary.  Both the screen and eye level viewfinder are about 1 megapixel in resolution, which is good, and both are clear.  There is plenty of info available to display on screen, including a histogram, which I use.  The photos were clear at all zoom settings, and the macros were sharp as well.  At wide angle, there is some barrel distortion, which is pretty much true of all wide angle lenses, and is easily corrected in Photoshop.  The HDR and low light modes worked well.  Generally speaking, I was impressed with the image quality.  The body is plastic, but seems solid, and is sealed well enough that they list the camera as weather resistant against dust and moisture.  The fit and finish seems good.  Overall, I really like this camera.  It won\u2019t replace my DSLR for weddings, but as a \u201cwalk around\u201d camera it is about perfect.  I think this will be my choice when I am out doing the tourist thing at the zoo or beach (it has a beach mode).  Good feel.  Good feature set.  Easy to carry.  Sometimes I don\u2019t want to be a pro, with two bodies and four lenses.  This will be the one I grab on those days.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "FinePix S1 is an excellent bridge camera", "Author": "Rusty Whitney", "ReviewID": "R2B5GM7VI5EMSL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "See Kort's review plus comments for the full story.Features I most like include 1200mm (equiv.) zoom, much better image resolution and clarity than Fuji's HS50, good battery life (intervalometer took a JPeg and RAF [RAW] image of bald eagles every 15 seconds for 6 hours including a rain storm), water and dust resistance, and WiFi control.Negatives include the tiny sensor doesn't handle low light very well, as of early May of '14 Adobe doesn't yet recognize the S1's RAW file format, and documentation fails to point out that digital zoom is deactivated if you elect to save RAW (\"RAF\") files.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Superb camera for daily shooting - can handle almost any situation", "Author": "Kristine Lofgren", "ReviewID": "R1LEA8D1UAN1QK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Normally I lug around a camera bag with a variety of Canon bodies and lenses, but I recently took a vacation and I needed something that could take good pictures, had a professional range of picture options and could withstand a little sand, water or mud (that's not too much to ask, is it?) so that I didn't have to risk my expensive rig.The Fujifilm FinePix S1 is the perfect camera for my needs. The 16mp CMOS censor with a 24 - 1200 mm F 2.8 - F 5.6 lens offers enough range that I can tackle pretty much any photo requirement, from tight close-ups in bright light to wide landscapes in evening light. It also has an Intelligent Zoom up to 100x (with a clever little button that can be operated with one finger) and a macro function so there is really nothing the single, unchangeable lens can't handle. The flip-out LCD screen gives me such good images that I can compose shots right on the LCD, which I generally don't do with my Canons. I also love that the LCD screen can flip around for selfies, but that's just me. It's also big and bright enough that you can shoot through the LCD in bright daylight.The camera is sealed up tight so you can use it pretty much anywhere (ok, not underwater) and behaves much like my beloved mid-range DSLRs with enough control and options to handle any situation. The camera has a built-in flash and a hotshoe so you can manage whatever illumination you need. The camera can shoot in JPEG and RAW and can even handle a live-shooting set up on a laptop so you can compose great shots in a studio.The camera also has movie and built-in feature modes, though I haven't messed with the filters (can't take the Photoshop out of the girl). But the movie mode (and the picture mode) are quick, responsive and gives you great images. It can also connect to Wi-Fi so you can quickly share all of your images through social media or right at home.With all of those bells and whistles, you would except to sacrifice some image quality, and though the pictures I took weren't perfect (it's unfair to compare a $3,000 kit to a $500 kit) they were stunningly good. I put the camera through the paces and it handled noise (there was quite a bit at low ISOs), chromatic aberrations, anti-shake, macro shooting and low light better than I would expect at this price point. The built-in panorama mode even worked fairly well, though you lose some quality and need a steady hand (or tripod).Overall, if you are looking for a sturdy camera that can handle a huge range of shooting situations - including wet and dusty ones -  without breaking the bank, I would definitely recommend this. You won't get professional quality images, nor should you expect to at this price, but for most images it holds its own nicely. The only real drawback I had is when shooting at 400 or 800 ISO the images had a lot of noise, almost to the point that I would rather use a smartphone camera. Otherwise, this camera really excels. So much so that I find myself grabbing it when I don't want the hassle of choosing a lens and body for day to day shooting.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "50x mega-zoom (24mm-1200mm), weather resistant, WiFi & app enabled", "Author": "M.

It's not a DSLR, yet it's much more than a basic point-and-shoot camera. It bridges the gap between those two types of cameras. It gives you many of the features that you might expect from a full-size DSLR yet retains some of the smaller size and lightness of the compact, point and shoot cameras. It has a remarkable \"mega-zoom\" 50x lens. It is not a removable lens so it's great that the provided lens has such a useful range... from 24mm wide angle to a most impressive 50x (1200mm) zoom. The macro capabilites of the lens are excellent.Here are some of the notable specifications of the Fujifilm S1:\u27a4 Fujinon 50x zoom lens equivalent to a 24mm - 1200mm 35mm lens\u27a4 16MP 1 2/3\" CMOS sensor\u27a4 3-stop image stabilization\u27a4 multi-CPU processor\u27a4 High-speed continuous shooting up to 10fps\u27a4 very fast startup time of 0.9sec at shortest focal distance\u27a4 Full HD movies at 1080/60fps\u27a4 5-axis image stabilization\u27a4 920k dot electronic viewfinder\u27a4 3\" variable-angle 920k dot LCD screen that folds and flips around\u27a4 left side zoom lever\u27a4 instant zoom buttonFuji has a smartphone/tablet app available that allows you to remote control the camera from the app using an adhoc network that the camera sets up. I use this app on my iPhone5s and iPad and it's fantastic. I setup my camera on a tripod near our bird feeder and am able to control the camera from inside my house using the app. I can control zoom, flash, timer delay and can also import photos from the camera to my laptop via the app. It works beautifully and I've gotten some amazing close shots of birds feeding at the bird feeder.The 50x lens on this camera is very versatile. It is not the fastest lens as far as f-stop (2.8-5.6) but it has great range. The 1x is 24mm equivalent and has a fast F/2.8 Fully zoomed at 50x is the equivalent of a 1200mm lens with an F/5.6. Talk about some great shooting possibilities. Put this camera on a tripod and that 1200mm lens really begins to be valuable. But because of the decent optical image stabilization you can even handhold the camera at 50x and get some great shots... but your technique better be spot on or you will get blurry results.I like the rubberized, weather resistant case. It feels great in the hand and provides a reasonable amout of protection from the elements. The hand grip is deep and contoured. A large thumb rest on the back of the camera is well-placed and when you are holding this camera it feels super secure.The button placement seems quite intuitive to me and easy to get to. I love that there is a dedicated video button for quick access to that mode. There is also a button near the shutter for burst mode. When selecting burst mode you have several options. When you press and hold the shutter you get the burst mode for as long as you continue to hold the shutter down and depending on the option you select it's up to 9fps. This is really great for sports or active kids.A \"Zoom Out Button\" is right above the zoom lever on the left side of the camera. This is helpful if you've ever been zoomed in tightly on a subject that then moves out of the frame, pressing this button quickly zooms out the lens so you can find your subject and recompose your shot. Releasing the button returns you to your previously zoomed position.A few features that I find particularly useful are the:\u2713 Burst Mode Button: gives you the ability to take a burst of photos when the shutter button is depressed and there are several types of burst mode to fit the situation best. This is useful for shooting sports or active kids.\u2713 Zoom Out Button: There is also a 'zoom out' button above the zoom toggle on the left side of the body. If you've ever been zoomed in tightly on a subject that moves out of frame, this is a useful button because it will quickl zoom out a bit so you can reframe... releasing the button returns you to the previous zoom.\u2713 Fn button: The 12 o'clock position of the 5-way controller is a Fn button. This is a great implementation because you can assign any one of numerous choices to that Fn button. This is done in the Settings Menu. But even greater is that on the fly you can change the function of that button without having to dive into the menu. All you have to do is press and hold the Fn button and the list of options is displayed. Simply choose the option you want and you've reset the Fn button to the new choice. Simple and efficient.A feature that wasn't too useful was the Manual Focus. In this camera you can select Manual Focus in the Shooting Mode > Focus Mode menu. Then you are able to use the thumbwheel to manually focus. Sounds great right? But in practice it is not easy to use. When you are  using manual focus with a lens, you've got the ability to quickly turn the lens in either direction to get focus. But by  using the thumbwheel you can't easily achieve an accurate focus quickly. I found it very frustrating to use the manual focus on this camera.You can assign any one of the following modes to the Fn button. On the fly you can easily change the mode that you have mapped to the Fn button:\u261e ISO,\u261e Image Size\u261e RAW\u261e White Balance\u261e Finepix Color\u261e Photometry\u261e Focus Mode\u261e Face Detection\u261e Movie Mode\u261e Manual shooting mode works really well on this camera particularly once you realize that pressing the exposure compensation button when in Manual mode toggles between aperture and shutter speed so that you can use the command dial to make changes easily.\u2713 During the recording of a video, pressing the shutter button will take a photograph without interrupting the movie recording. The photo is saved separately. This is a really helpful feature that I use quite often.\u2713 The camera can capture images as Fine, Normal, Fine + RAW, Normal + RAW and RAW\u2713 The camera actually has a small amount of Internal Memory (about 37MB). While this is a paltry and nearly worthless amount, it just might save the day if you ever arrive somewhere but forgot to put a memory card back in your camera before leaving the house. It's happened to me and instead of getting no pictures, at least you'll be able to get a few and possibly save the day.There are plenty of shooting modes to keep newbies as happy as the pros:\u27a4 Program AE\u27a4 Shutter Priority AE\u27a4 Aperture Priority AE\u27a4 Maunal\u27a4 Custom ModeYou have several image quality settings:\u27a4 Normal\u27a4 Fine\u27a4 RAW\u27a4 RAW + Normal\u27a4 RAW + Fine. As I write my review there is no native MacOS support for the RAW files that the S1 produces. I'm confident that Apple will provide an update soon that will fix this issue. But for now that means you need to use the included program, \"RAW File Converter EX by Silkypix\", a program I dread using because of its interface... very un-Mac like. And for some reason the program doesn't see files on my SD cards or computer. When I choose the Open File menu option, the resulting window is empty. So I have to go into a finder window, navigate to the files and then drag the files into the program. I dislike the program.There are a few more things that I'm not really happy about...\u2717 The movie mode has a super slow motion option of 480fps which sounds pretty cool but unfortunately the resolution at that setting is so small (240x180), it's nearly worthless. There is also a 240fps option but the resolution is also small (320x240.) But the 120fps option gives you 640x480 resolution which is useable. Here are all the movie modes:- 1920x1080 - 60fps- 1280x720 - 60fps- 640x480 - 30fps- 640x480 - 120fps- 320x240 - 240fps- 240x180 - 480fps\u2717 I'm also dismayed a bit that the tripod mount has plastic threads instead of metal.\u2717 Another thing that is missing is a lens hood. This should have been included with the kit rather than having it be an optional accessory.This camera has a lot going for it. I've just begun to explore the various shooting modes but so far it's taking great shots and is intuitive to use.Pros:\u27a4 Camera is weather resistant, easy to handle and very lightweight\u27a4 Excellent manual control\u27a4 Some great shooting modes\u27a4 Shoots in RAW\u27a4 Battery can be charged in camera by USBCons:\u27a4 Lens Hood is not included but available as an optional accessory\u27a4 Zoom noise is very noticeable in movies and even when not actively zooming you can hear noise from the motor\u27a4 Tripod mount has plastic threads and is not center lined with lens\u27a4 No jack for connecting an external microphoneGeneral comments:I'm not a big fan of electronic viewfinders and the EVF in this camera is not that great. The sharpness is lacking and color accuracy is weak. Just this evening I was shooting some shots of an amazing sunset and the EVF made it look almost like B&W; while what I was seeing with my eyes was blazing, vibrant color. I switched to the 3\" display and that wasn't much better. And I always have a problem using EVF in very low light situations. You can't really see anything through the EVF in those situations. So this camera has that limitation.This isn't the ultimate camera, but it's fun to use and takes good pictures. The range of the lens makes it very versatile and the camera does a good job with giving you enough features and control to get creative. I feel that the ease of using a camera and intuitive controls is quite important. This camera is easy to use, has intuitive controls and other than the EVF that I don't care for too much is otherwise a very nice camera for someone who just wants to take some great photos.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "class under the rest", "Author": "WalkingHeart", "ReviewID": "R3BP2JNGHSEX3A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i don't know what to tell ya.. first feel is great then it goes down hill from there.. i couldn't get it to focus on the things i wanted it to focus on.. like a bird in the grass and all the thing does is pick up the grass no matter how many settings on it.. even the manual focus (which some said it didn't have) was crap.. you try to manually focus it with the jog wheel, and each click your either farther or too close, just not right on in focus.. and have you seen how much a hood is for this thing?? 45.00.. you have to get adapters to use a filter of Any kind..  and if you want or need to get to your battery or memory card you have to take the tripod piece off before you can do it, and the hole isn't in the center, And the threads are Plastic.. and picture quality?? forget it.. all the bells and whistles are Really neat, but fuji, you let me down on this one.. i've had the hs series from the 10 on up and they, even my hs10 blows this camera out of the water.. in fact, the electric view finder, well, it looks like your looking through my hs10..

Haggard", "ReviewID": "RHVURJCALBRIO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the opportunity to try this camera out. I am by no means a professional photographer, in fact prior to getting this camera I couldn't have told you the difference in f/ stops, aperture, ISO or shutter speeds or how they worked together to deliver an awesome picture. Fact is I had a Nikon COOLPIX L820 16 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 30x Zoom Lens and Full HD 1080p Video (Red) and that was to me a really great camera. Boy was I wrong. Now let me say why.The Nikon L820 is a terrific point and shoot camera. If you don't want to have much control over the quality of the photos and shoot in good lighting then it is a perfect camera. But I learned when I went to Cumberland Falls in Kentucky to see an event called the \"moon bow\" where a full moon rises over the falls and generates a rainbow in the mist I looked around and saw all these high end cameras, and I had my L820 and I felt good, they all started snapping pictures and I tried and all I got was pure black in my pictures as I tried to snap the waterfall in the dark. Everyone else had these crystal clear pictures with the moonbow visible in the picture and oh it was awesome, and I had nothing... It was at that point I realized the L820 wasn't as good for dark scenarios as I had thought it would be. That being said it takes awesome pictures of the moon.Ok, now on to the Fujifilm S1. This camera has all the basic auto modes you could want. For those times when the camera can figure out the best picture, which frankly is most of the time you have pure auto. It figures out aperture and shutter speed for you. If you want to have more control you can flip into aperture priority or shutter priority. If you really want full control you can flip it to full manual and tweak everything, this is where I have been shooting as of late. The camera takes really nice pictures, but to get those artistic effects with a blurry background and clear, crisp target, or the \"movement\" of the water you need to manually tell the camera to use a slower ISO, shut the aperture a bit and leave the shutter open a bit longer. In doing so I have been able to get some phenomenal pictures of the night sky with stars shining bright, something the L820 could never do. I have captured awesome pictures of waterfalls and you can sense the water moving thanks to the slower ISO, longer shutter time and higher F/ stop.  The beauty of this camera is I knew nothing about these settings, and in a couple weeks I can go outdoors, push a button or two and dial in my settings and get a great picture in a few shots. It's so easy to use.One of the greatest features I love about this camera is the weather resistance of it. I live in Tennessee and we had some nasty storms roll through yesterday. This camera has a great time lapse feature where you can set it to take pictures every X amount of time for X amount of hours. I set it to take a picture every 15 seconds for 2 hours, I put it on my tripod and pointed it up at the sky and let it go. Part way through the time lapse sequence it started to drizzle, but because this camera is weather proof I wasn't that concerned (ok I was, but it proved it could handle it!). 2 hours later I replayed the time lapse and it was so cool to see the clouds moving across the sky, 2 hours of cloud movement was sped up to run in only 60 seconds, how cool it was.Battery life is great. I have NEVER had the battery die on me once and I have taken this hiking on multiple trips and snapped several hundred photos each time. I did buy an extra battery but feel silly now since the original has never came out of the camera. One thing I love about this camera, the battery charges with a micro USB cable, the same one my cell phone uses so I don't have to lug some proprietary cable with me. Anywhere I'm at I can plug the camera in, that includes my car as I drive around and it charges right up.Now this camera is lacking a few things that I wish it had. One is Bulb mode. I had no idea what this feature was but it's apparently how people catch lightning. It allows you to keep the shutter open as long as you push a button. This camera has a max shutter time of 30 seconds. Now 30 seconds is a long time, but I would have loved to see them build in a bulb mode on this thing (if they did I haven't been able to find it.)The other gripe is a lack of GPS. The pictures record the settings you shot them in so you can view the aperture, shutter speed, lighting, etc. But it doesn't tag them with GPS locations which is a bummer. Fuji did sort of solve this however by giving you a free app you can download from the google play or apple stores and actually tag pictures by using your phones GPS. It works, but its clunky and I always forget to turn that feature on.Speaking of the app, one other thing I love about this thing is the ability to transfer pictures with the wifi feature directly to your phone. I have a high speed samsung 16gb card in my camera and it's lightning fast, I mean I take a raw picture and it doesn't even hesitate. But with my other camera the picture was stuck on the camera until I got to a computer. With this one it has a button you push to activate a wifi mode, then you fire up the app on your phone and you can actually transfer pictures from the camera to your phone for instant sharing, or even just to back them up in case your card in the phone goes belly up. It's great to remove the need for a PC with this camera.Overall it's really a great beginners camera. It's really easy to use, it has taken some really great pictures (it's taken really bad ones to but that's the photographers fault. :)  It is weather proof which means I'm taking it kayaking with me this year for capturing those pics that I couldn't have gotten with my L820, it's built solid, battery life is awesome. I just really don't have any gripes other than bulb mode doesn't appear to exist on this thing. Everything else about it I love, and truth be told I'm only missing Bulb mode because it's not on it. I would probably only use that a few times a year anyway. for me I have caught many great pictures with the 30 second shutter speed. I would definitely recommend this camera to you if you are in the market for one. I'm still mastering the various controls, but it's so easy to tweak them I love it.I haven't even talked about the pre-defined filters like only taking pics of green and putting the rest in grey scale, the \"toy camera\" or \"diorama\" effect that blurs the top and bottom of the pic. The Macro and super macro modes. This camera just packs so much and it's so easy to use. I was afraid it would be so complicated that I would have given up on it with the various settings and stuck it in full auto mode.

We have been through quite a few cameras, although not top of the line, still not inexpensive by any means.  $500 is usually the price range of cameras we have purchased.The Fujifilm FinePix S1 is a contradiction of sorts.

Sometimes the colors captured were exquisite and better than any other camera I have ever used.  I didn't have to do any adjusting at all.  Other times they were abyssmal.For instance, in taking 10 pictures in a row, changing absolutely nothing, it was virtually impossible to have two pictures turn out alike.  They were all vastly different.  Sometimes they were dark, sometimes way too light, sometimes perfect.  That is a lot of effort to capture the perfect picture.On the flip side, one night in absolute frustration not being able to capture anything decent at all, I turned out all of the lights so that the room was pitch black.  I held my camera up to my fish tanks and snapped a few pictures.  Besides traumatizing my fish from the sudden light, I was shocked to see some of the most beautiful photos I had taken all evening.  Perfect colors, clarity and definition consistently.It appears that when you use the flash, that the color calibration kicks into high gear and you get pretty darned good photos.You can not live your life taking flash photos unfortunately.PHOTO QUALITYI found that by using various settings and experimenting, I could get pretty nice photos- but I had to use a lot of effort.  The menu is not easy to navigate, nor is it forgiving if you take too long to decipher it- it shuts off on you and you have to go through it again.I did find that sometimes I was taking what I thought were fantastic photos (from the LCD screen) only to upload them to my photo editing program and seeing that they were grainy or blurry or just plain flat and un-dimensional.  On the LCD screen they looked amazing.  On the other hand, sometimes they turned out blah on my LCD screen, but great on the SD card.Once in a while, I have problems with my Canon with color.  I love bright colors and my photography focus is often color oriented.  Canon often understates color way too much for me and I have to spend some time to get it to look accurate in photo editing.  With the FinePix S1, however, once in a while, I could capture color that was so gorgeous and realistic that I would gasp and be very excited.The problem is that it is not always predictable and that was frustrating.  Like the proverbial carrot on the string in front of the horse, I find myself reaching for this camera when frustrated with my others to capture colors that don't seem to do well on any other camera.  Once in a while the effort is worth it so I come back for more frustration.FINAL COMMENTSAs I said at the beginning, I have a bit of a love hate relationship with this camera.  On the one hand it is a lot of work to get decent photos, but on the other hand, when you do manage to get one, it is amazing.  Rare, but amazing.If Fujifilm would fix the issues with depth in photos, consistency in the light sensor, and quality issues on automatic settings, this camera would be a MUST buy.  As it is now, however, I can only give it three stars because of the inconsistency in quality of photos and the effort I have to go through to get a good one.  I gave it three stars because once in a while it does capture photos with brilliant colors that none of my other cameras will capture, despite the slightly lower quality at times.  The videos are great- sound excellent and clarity nice.  The flash is great.  Out of the way when you don't want it- and nice photos.  It has potential to be a fantastic camera.As it is now, until they correct a few things, it is only average.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Meh culpa, meh culpa meh fujifilm culpa", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1WDUFJG0F9TWH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I actually, you know, paid money for this camera, which I think distinguishes me from the previous eight reviewers. Whether or not that's a useful distinction is left to the reader.I live in a Florida, I go to the beach a lot, and I like to take pictures of birds, alligators, kite sailors and suchlike. These are reasons to lust after and even actually pay for an environmentally sealed camera with a monster lens.Here are some preliminary findings.Sealing I won't know for a while how well sealed the camera is. Where I live in coastal Florida, just leaving it on a shelf constitutes an accelerated humidity test. There aren't any garish visual clues, which is welcome.LensThe lens is satisfactory in most respects. News flash: its resolution and bokeh don't match a Canon 70-200 f2.8, but I didn't expect that, and I'm sure that you don't either. Since mostly I just email my pix to people who may not even look at them, the rez is just fine. Compared to a Canon SX40 HS, the lens traverses more smoothly and doesn't require the back and forth stutter steps the latter requires to zoom in on the right focal length. For me, this is a big plus. Its immediate predecessor had a manual zoom, which I think is a superior arrangement.ViewfinderThe biggest disappointment. I had high hopes for a large bright finder. While it is way better than that of the aforementioned Canon, it's not in the knock your socks off category, although maybe it makes them sag a little. When you look into the finder without glasses, there is a large black border which initially made me think that Fuji had planned a nice big finder, but at the last minute substituted something cheaper. I am guessing that Fuji's explanation would be that the humongous margins are necessary to provide eye relief for people wearing glasses.Compared to other EVFs that I've used, this one seems to require much more care in positioning the eye. It seems to me that it's relatively easy to get off-axis and suffer the concomitant dimming. Speaking of dimming, at its default setting, the EVF is pretty bad in low light. It may be that I can boost this setting at the possible cost of decreased battery life and burnout in bright conditions. There's always the Sony RX10, but that's three times the money and a fourth of the zoom.General CarpingThe free strap sucks. It's kind of stiff and bulky and full of advertising, but the same could be said for the straps that come with high end DSLRs.There aren't physical dials for shutter speed and aperture. This may be because there is little demand.Lack of a separate charger bothered me for a few minutes because it seemed kind of tacky. But then the news of saving $0.57 on a $15,000 car at the cost of a few dozen lives made me reevaluate.Battery life could be better. It looks as if I'll have to pack a backup for all day jaunts. Or maybe I'll just quit taking pictures when the battery runs out. It's not as if I'm going to disappoint National Geographic or even my relatives.ReconsideringAs I look at this review, I can see that many of my complaints could be answered with \"You get what you pay for.\" After a few weeks of use, I plan to update this review to reflect my experience in the field.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mega Zoom + weather resistant", "Author": "Amy Willingham", "ReviewID": "RTTYAUIQTIZKC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fujifilm FinePix S1 16 MP Digital Camera is a wonderful camera for people who want to upgrade from point and shoot but not all the way to the high end cameras.

More important than whistles. When it comes to a camera, no amount of features are as important as one simple question. And that question is \"How well does it take pictures?\"And in the case of the Fuji Finepix S1 the answer is \"It depends...\" It depends on what you're going to do with your pictures. Are you going to look at them on the camera's 3\" screen? Are you going to share them with friends who use cell phones? Are you going to post them to Facebook and Twitter and maybe Flickr? Then you will probably be happy with this camera.I have to admit I'm what people, sometimes insultingly, call a pixel peeper. I honestly believe that if the sensor of my camera produces a 4608 x 3456 pixel image that one which is properly composed and shot should look good at its original, 100% magnification, size. The Finepix S1, not so much. I've shot several hundred pictures with the S1 and I believe I've come up with two pictures that look okay (not outstanding, okay) at 100%. That's not saying this won't take a decent picture. Reduce the size to 1920 x 1080 or smaller and the images look much better. Out of the hundreds I've shot I've saved more than a few 'good' pictures.A few drawbacks I'd like to point out about the Finepix S1:This is supposed to be their new 'flagship' big zoom camera but it has a smaller sensor than their HS30EXR and HS50EXR cameras. Why not put the bigger sensor in the (currently) more expensive 'flagship' camera?No external battery charger is included. Charging is done in camera via a USB cable and AC adapter.The camera is not threaded for filters. Seriously? To mount a filter on the camera you need to purchase a relatively expensive adapter. Plus you'll need a lens cap that fits the filter dimensions since the camera's cap cannot be used with the filter adapter.No lens hood is included. An optional and somewhat expensive lens hood is available. The optional lens hood and filter adapter ring cannot be used together.The screen for the EVF is somewhat far inside the camera housing. There is white light coming from the bottom of the EVF enclosure and the EVF screen is significantly smaller than the space it is in. This makes it feel like you're looking around a tiny movie theater.The battery can be inserted wrong way around. I don't see this as doing damage to the camera but I've never seen a battery system that didn't have some kind of notch or tab to keep you from inserting the battery in the wrong way. You can fully latch the battery down and not have power to the camera.When I first read the user's manual I was psyched to find out the camera had the capability to shoot high speed video. This was always something I wanted to play around with. Then I tried it...The fastest the camera will record is 480 fps (frames per second) which is fairly impressive except it only records that fast at a resolution of 240 x 180 pixels. The video quality was good and the slow motion was fairly impressive but even on a 5\" cell phone screen that size video is small. It's an unviewable postage stamp on a 23\" monitor. Switching to 120 fps results in a 640 x 480 resolution video. This size was viewable and could even been watched (the quality suffered) full screen but the video speed wasn't as exciting as the much faster recording rate. It did make birds in flight an interesting sight but that was about it.Some good things about the Finepix S1:The camera body is weather sealed. It is dust and water resistant (I would not submerge it). If there's a hurricane or thunderstorm and I want to take pictures (and I will) this is the camera I'll be reaching for.The 3\" LCD screen is fully articulated which combined with the weather sealing opens lots of opportunities for interesting photography.Super macro mode with ~1cm focal distance.Smooth and quick zooming within the full 50x (24-1200mm) range. The zoom control on the shutter button has two speeds and there is a separate zoom control on the lens barrel which can be set to fast or slow zooming.The camera has a nicely rubberized grip and body. It felt quite secure in my hands.All in all? I like the features and function of this camera but I'm not ecstatic about the image quality. There's significant noise and grain in low light, shots where the ISO is above 400 and at the long end of the zoom. Reducing the size of the images and some post processing work can produce decent pictures. It is an interesting mix of technology and the weather sealing is a plus but the image quality isn't much better than my several years old Kodak Z990 which though not weather sealed has made hundreds of trips to the beach without incident or damage.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "A decent performer, but there may be better options", "Author": "Wiggly", "ReviewID": "R3VKOFP3WEFE6C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So, I'm not going to fill this review with information on the specs and capabilities of this little super zoom. All that info should be apparent from the write-ups and pro reviews. Nor am I going to make comparisons to larger-sensor, more expensive, bridge cameras (e.g. Sony RX10 and Olympus Stylus S1) or modern DSLRs with their huge sensors, as that would be unfair.I'm sure you're reading this because you want to see how it compares to its immediate peers: the Sony HX300 and HX400, Panasonic FZ70, and Canon SX50, all of which offer enormous optical zooms with small sensors, but still light enough to carry around (if not exactly pocketable). They're a definite niche, but offer a good deal of flexibility in a complete package at reasonable cost.On the plus side: the weather sealing of the S1 is a nice touch. I wouldn't exactly submerge it in water, but the dust-proofing and water-resistant seals are something you don't find among this group usually, so that's a definite bonus. The EVF and LCD (fully rotating) are a decent resolution and clear. The EVF is small but serviceable; it's a shame there is no eye-detection, however.The focusing in good light is quick, and the zoom has excellent reach and is pretty fast, too. Overall, I was pretty impressed by how responsive it is to zoom and shoot.There are not a great deal of manual controls (in terms of buttons). I'd really have liked more than one programmable function button (which can only be mapped to a single, chosen function). For example, the dedicated Wi-Fi button could have been put to such a use.In hand, the camera feels nice, with a big grip and a good, tactile surface. Though it's \"plasticky\" and the battery compartment was a bit rattly, the S1 is surprisingly solid. Talking of battery, it needs to be charged within the camera when plugged in. This is a common `feature' these days, so if you want to charge an additional battery, you have to buy a separate charger.Image quality: Seemed a bit flat to me. Usually well exposed (except in \"super auto\" mode, where I saw a lot of blown-out highlights) but a little soft and smudged. I don't see the usual \"FujiFilm\" color pop -- I'm not sure if that's only reserved for Fuji's bigger sensor offerings -- but perhaps it's just how the camera processes JPEG images. However, you can shoot RAW for more control, (an advantage over the Sonys), but I don't think the S1 has been added to the list of supported cameras in Adobe's Camera RAW yet. I thought the macro mode was pretty darn good for a super zoom, though watch out for shadows cast by that enormous lens!For sharing images on the web or with friends online, the quality is good enough. Pixel-peepers would probably not be happy, but I don't think they're the target market. However, looking at the images people have produced with the Canon SX50 and Panasonic FZ70 on user-forums like DPreview, it makes me wonder whether some of the S1's competition could be doing a better job with their small-sensor JPEG image processing, and that's worth thinking about. Also, because those cameras are a little older, they might be available at a better price.The S1 offers a great deal in a small package and the weather-sealing is a really nice feature. However, I'm just not sure it has enough unique features to give it a distinct edge over its peers.(Note that I didn't compare the S1 to some other long-zoom competitors like the Panasonic FZ200. That offers a bright 2.8 aperture across the whole zoom range, though with significantly less reach than the S1's 50x. The FZ200 is comparatively priced (probably a lot cheaper these days) and offers better value, image quality, and more features, despite less zoom. Also, make sure you don't confuse the FujiFilm S1 with the older FujiFilm X-S1. Fuji's naming conventions get a bit confusing! The X-S1 is bigger, with a larger sensor, better build quality, and offers a manually-controlled zoom, albeit with 'merely' 26x optical range.)", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Only for the Weatherproofing", "Author": "Randy Wakeman \"Randy Wakeman\"", "ReviewID": "R2CYK14PCQQXF7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "In brief, the Fujifilm FinePix S1 has little to offer over the bargain-priced ($279) Fujifilm SL1000 except for the touted sealing and weatherproofing.

Note this is not the older and larger X-S1.1. Currently, it is the only weather-sealed superzoom camera on the market. If you often shoot in an environment that is humid/dusty/dirty, and you only want to bring one camera, this is the ideal choice. The non-interchangeable 50X all-in-one lens prevents foreign objects from entering the camera, as it is possible on DSLR cameras when a lens is swapped for another. According to the maker, the camera has 70 moisture/dust seals throughout the camera and lens. The S1 is much smaller than the Fujifilm X-S1 and has a non-slip outer surface for very secure handling. For a camera designed to be used in rough environments, I wish Fujifilm would include a lens hood to protect the lens. It is being sold seperately at a rather expensive $50.2. Wireless transfer of image files to smartphone and tablet, plus remote control of camera (shutter release and zoom function) via smartphone and tablet.3. Advanced filters built-in that can be used in both picture and movie functions. These include Toy Camera, Miniature, Pop Color, High Key, Low Key, Dynamic Tone, Fish Eye, Soft Focus, Cross Screen, and Partial Color (choose among red, orange, green, yellow, blue, and purple). In addition, various functions are provided to enhance picture-taking: Pro Low Light, HDR, Natural Flash, and Zoom Bracketing. All of these functions involve automated digital merging and processing of multiple pictures taken at different settings.4. The S1 has the ability to shooting in the following modes for different image quality and file size: RAW, Normal + RAW, Fine + RAW, Normal, and Fine.All superzoom cameras with very high zoom ratio and small physical size achieve this feat by deliberately using a small image sensor (typically 1/2.3 inch).  If a APS-C, Micro Four-thirds, or Full-Frame sensor is used, both the cost and physical size of the camera/lens would be prohibitively large. Consequently, cameras with the above much larger sensors can have zoom lenses that have a zoom range of 3X to 5X at most.But a small sensor's sensitivity to light is inferior to larger sensors, so if your shooting situation invloves a lot of low-light photography, you may want to consider the Sony RX10 camera, which has a 1-inch sensor and a large (f/2.8), constant aperture 8.3X zoom lens. This camera has many high-end features and accordingly costs about two and a half times as much as the S1.I deem the Fujifilm S1 an ideal camera for me, because it fits my set of requirements (relatively low cost AND high versatility, all-in-one high-zoom lens, small size, water and dust resistant, Wi-Fi connectivity and remote control capability) and compromises (noisier pictures at high ISO settings).", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "All in all, a solid bridge camera that fills the gap between point and shoot and full feature DSLRs", "Author": "ARH", "ReviewID": "R1A4QS4Q6CIOT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, the short version:My conclusion is that this is a camera you should consider seriously if you are not interested in a full feature, changeable lens DSLR, but still want you want more than just a point and shoot digital camera.  This is a solid workhorse that performs well under adverse environmental conditions, and produces nice pictures.Now for the long version:I've been shooting with this camera for the past month.I was excited to try it out, especially because of it's weather-resistant construction.  The first time I used it was during a Spring snowstorm, not shower - storm!  The snow was coming down wet and heavy..  By the time I got where I was going the camera was completely soaked.  I mean, there wasn't just a drop of water here and there, it was running off.  I was a little nervous about that, but I shook it off, toweled it off, and NO PROBLEM.I've used this camera in full daylight, on gray cloudy days with strong diffuse backlighting, indoors, and most recently to shoot the Blood Moon full lunar eclipse that happened last night (4/15/2015).  I have tried to shoot the moon before with my DSLR and 300mm zoom lens but with only limited success.  This camera performed like a champ and would have done even better if I'd gotten out my tripod (OK I was tired and a bit lazy and it was 12:30-1:30am...so I didn't).You can check out some of the photos I've taken with this camera at this URL:[...]The photos I took with this camera start with those featuring Bohemian waxwings (birds).  My lunar eclipse photos are also there.OK, here are some likes and dislikes about this camera:Likes:1) Compact size. It is much lighter and easier to carry around my full feature DSLR, bag, and extra lenses.  I wish I'd had this camera last summer when I was backpacking in Yellowstone.  I would have loved to shed the extra weight of my telephoto zoom lens!2) Weather-resistant construction.  I do lots of outdoor photography, especially in the mountains and along streams and rivers, so having a weather resistant camera will put my mind at ease.3) Comfortable grip and lightweight body.4) Swivel and pivot LCD screen for immediately previewing shots - nice,  something I also love about my Nikon.5) 50x optical zoom...equivalent of about 1200mm zoom capability.  The picture quality is surprisingly good, even at maximum zoom, though a tripod is recommended for stillness at max zoom.  Even so, the anti-vibration technology in this camera steadies things up nicely.6) Aperture-preference, shutter speed-preference, and full manual preference options.  The programmable option also allows you to save preferred settings.7) WiFi option.  This is cool!  It allows me to send photos from my camera directly to my smartphone (a Samsung Galaxy S2) using free downloadable software.  I can also take photos remotely using my phone...no need for a separate IR camera remote, plus I can see what the camera sees.Dislikes:1) The door to the battery/SD card compartment doesn't feel like secure when it closes.  The latch doesn't snap into place like I'd expect it to, yet it has not yet popped open accidentally.2) The battery can be slipped into its compartment backwards (so it doesn't work).  It would have taken only a minor engineering or design adjustment to make it fit only one way.3) The shoulder/neck strap is adequate, but it has a rough texture, and I want not want to have around my neck for very long unless I'm wearing a shirt with a collar to protect my neck.4) The lens cap pops off too easily when I put the camera into a bag...the lens just doesn't fit quite snugly enough, and the spring in the cap isn't strong enough to prevent many accidental removals.5) The battery has to be charged in the camera.  This is a minor inconvenience, but it still bothers me for some reason.OK, those things are not really enough to deduct a star, so here's where it lost one for me - two things.6) I have not yet been able to figure out how to shift from a broad focal field to a focal point.  This makes it difficult/impossible to focus on things in the background, e.g., a bird in a tree with branches in front of it; the camera's autofocus defaults to focusing on the nearest object.7) There is something about the image finder that bugs me.  It's hard to put a finger on, but it's like it's totally digital, too digital.  Of course this is not a true SLR, but this factor makes it difficult for me to find things amidst clutter in the field of view.  E.g. If I'm trying to photograph a bird on the ground and the ground is covered with leaves or bark, it's hard to find the bird - something about too much contrast or something.  It's much more difficult to spot what I'm shooting than when I use my Nikon...the S1 is a distant second to my DSLR in this category.Anyway, the last two things dropped this admirable performer from full 5 stars to 4 stars.This is still a solid performer, and I look forward to using in when the weather is dicey.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "A very capable bridge camera", "Author": "Techie Evan", "ReviewID": "R3ILHVBL3ZUTS3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Fujifilm FinePix S1 is a very fine compact and lightweight bridge camera that offers a broad range of features supportive of both novice and more experienced photographers, and casual (point-and-shoot) to more (user-) controlled picture- and movie-shooting.It has a 1/2.3-inch 16 megapixel backlit CMOS sensor, and an integrated lens-and-body design.  Other noteworthy parts include manual zoom controls at both the left- and right-hand sides of the camera; a built-in flash with a hotshoe for a not-included optional external flash unit; a 3-inch 920k-dot LCD monitor for composition help; a 920k-dot electronic viewfinder (EVF) alternative to the monitor with a nearby diopter adjustment wheel that helps users with eyesight problems make the EVF display work better for them;  microphone and speakers; a dual purpose AF-assist illuminator (that enables the camera to focus even when the subject is poorly lit)  and self-timer lamp; controls for power on-off, built-in WiFi, menu- and shooting-mode selections, playback, continuous or burst-mode shooting, exposure compensation, and movie-recording; housing for an NP-85 lithium-ion rechargeable battery, SD/SDHC/SDXC memory card (up to 128GB), USB and HDMI ports; and a screw thread for a tripod that is, unfortunately, made of plastic and is not in line with the lens barrel.The included CD contains a digital version of the complete owners' manual and the FinePix Studio software for importing, viewing, printing, and editing of the files stored in the camera's limited internal memory  (only 37 MB) and memory card.FEATURE and LIMITATION HIGHLIGHTS (in no particular order):* The camera supports casual picture-taking via an Auto mode, where users let software embedded in the camera determine values such as shutter speed, aperture stops, etc. that are deemed \"best\" for shooting, say, portraits, landscapes, or action-oriented images (e.g., sports photography).  Most of the time, the results would be very good.  For users who want to have better or more creative control of the desired results, however, they can switch to using manual settings and advanced features that let them create special effects (e.g. \"diorama\" or \"fisheye\" effects), perform exposure compensation, modulate flash output and sensitivity, etc.* Menus for playback, shooting, and setup options are easy to use (i.e., laid out well, not more than three levels deep, etc.). Playback options include capabilities to protect files from accidental deletion, and simple editing of images (e.g., crop, rotate, etc) and movies (e.g., remove beginning and ending footages, append existing footage to current end of movie, etc.). Shooting options include specifying image size, aspect ratio, and quality, photometry method to use, ISO light sensitivity level, how to adjust color for light sources (white balance), etc.  Setup options include setting language (e.g., English, Spanish, etc.), current date and time, turn on or off things such as shutter sound, auto power off, etc.* The non-interchangeable lens has an amazing 50x optical zoom capability (a 35mm equivalent focal range of 24-1200mm) that can be enhanced to a 100x capability via software-supported digital zoom. It has a minimum focusing distance of just 1cm and has 3-stop lens-shift, optical image stabilisation to help users take the sharpest shots possible.* The camera can quickly determine focus and exposure when the shutter button is pressed halfway, taking about a fraction of a second to lock onto the subject in ideal lighting conditions. According to the specs, shutter speed can be as short as 1/2000 second to as long as 30 seconds (good for night photography).* ISO light sensitivity values can be set to a low of 100 to a high of 12800, but at settings of 6400 and 12800, image resolutions are reduced, and image size is limited to 8 and 4 megapixels, respectively.* Image quality is generally very good.  Portrait shots have good skin tones and are free of red-eye when using the flash. Limited purple fringing effects can become evident in high-contrast image areas.  ISO noise performance tends to hold up well at values of 500 or less; but becomes increasingly poorer at higher values.* At a CIPA (Camera and Imaging Products Association) rating of 350 shots, battery life is very good* Tools that report back whether one may be having a potential under- or over-exposure problem at hand, etc. are useful and informative* Images can be saved in JPEG (compressed), RAW (uncompressed) and RAW + JPEG formats. Movies are saved in MOV (H.264) format.* Burst mode or continuous high-speed shooting, where several images can be captured and recorded in quick succession, supports the shooting of subjects in motion, allowing the photographer to select the best image of the group or arrange the images in a sequence to study the transitions in detail.  All the continuous shooting modes record in full 16 megapixel resolution up to a maximum rate of 10 frames per second, but you can't shoot in RAW or with the flash.* The Panorama shooting option allows one to take wide-vista images easily by 'sweeping' with the camera while keeping the shutter button depressed. The camera automatically processes and stitches the related images into one unified image, but the resulting image is of fairly low resolution and moving subjects appear \"ghosted.\"* Full 1080p HD movie recording at up to 60 frames per second with stereo sound and 5-Axial image stabilisation is supported. Quality is good and the focus does an excellent job when zooming in and out, but the noise of the zoom is picked up and is quite loud.* The built-in Wi-Fi supports file sharing and remote smartphone control of the camera. After downloading the Fujifilm camera app to your smartphone or tablet, switch the camera on and hit the Wi-Fi button. Then connect to the Wi-Fi via your smartphone or tablet and go to the app. The app is not difficult to use, but if you go to remote control, then want to switch to image transfer you need to reconnect each time.* The camera has several sealed areas to provide better protection against dust and rain, and is easy to handle and grip.OVERALL RATING:I'm giving this Fujifilm FinePix S1 bridge camera an overall rating of four stars because it has many positives going for it, and none of the above-mentioned negatives is a serious limitation for me.", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beach Lovers buy this!", "Author": "Kimberly R.

The ergonomics of it is awesome - it just FEELS good. Whenever I want to take a quick snap shot, this is the camera that I grab for first.  This camera is not too big and bulky like some DSLRs.  When I press the EVF button and look through the electronic view finder, it reminds me of a smaller version of the hybrid on the X100S.  I took some images of the moon at about 3 AM, hand held with no tripod, and I was amazed at how well the images came out. Note: two of the images are posted in the image section.*End updateIf you are an outdoor person and want to take images then this is the camera for you. If you like to go to the beach then this camera is a jewel!  There are so many great things about this camera to where I do not know where to begin but first let me compare the S1 to other cameras in its class.\u2714COMPARISONBased on 35mm equivalents, wide angle to telephoto.\u261eFujiFilm (S1)...50X.....24mm - 1200mm\u261eCanon (SX50)..50X... 24mm - 1200mm\u261ePanas (FZ70)...60X... 20mm - 1200mm\u261eNikon (P520)...42X... 24mm - 1000mmThis FujiFilm shines in jpeg image output. I am extremely impressed by the Super Macro mode! The Canon looked a little washed out but images still look nice. The Pany was true to color and appeared to have built in HDR ( when taking an image where half is in the shade and the other half sunny, the Pany took two images then automatically combined them). The Nikon takes wonderful images IF the subject is static, but if you have a moving object expect to get blurry images from the Nikon.If you do a lot of macro shooting and lots of outdoor shooting then I definitely recommend this fuji S1.Here are some of the great things about this camera:..........Weather Resistant..........Dust Resistant..........50X Optical Zoom (24mm - 1200 mm)..........Super MACRO Zoom..........One touch Wireless transfer (Wi-Fi)..........F2.8 aperture at 24mm end..........F5.6 aperture at 1200mm end..........Remote shooting between smartphone/tablet using an app..........Full HD movies..........Continuous shooting, up to 10fps..........Face Detection..........Get a Date/Time stamp on your photographs..........Time-lapse shotsHere are some of the features of this camera:MOVIE RECORDING OPTIONS..........1920 x 1080, 60p (Full HD)..........1280 x 720, 60p (HD)..........640 x 480, 30pFILE FORMATS..........JPEG..........RAW..........RAW + JPEGMOVIE FORMAT..........File Format: Mov..........Compression: H.264..........Audio: Linear PCM StereoINTERVAL SHOOTINGInterval: 10 min, 5 min, 60 sec, 30 sec, 15 sec.Shooting duration: 6 hr, 3 hr, 2 hr, 60 min, 30 min, 10 min, 5 min.\u2714VIDEO TRANSCRIPTHere is the FujiFilm FinePix S1 camera.\u25baBattery ChargingTo charge this camera, you  need the following:---NP-85 rechargeable battery---AC power adapter---Plug adapter---USB cableInsert the rechargeable battery into your camera.

So far I find it to be an awesome camera. The last camera I bought was a Cybershot dsc-h20 and it really took my passion away for photography, even after reading all the good reviews on it. It sucked. This camera renewed my passion and I have taken over 1300 shots since I got it.The goodI love the macro and super macro that this camera is capable of. I like to photograph nature close up whether it is a flower or a bug. The pictures are incredible!Awesome job FujiI don't really know a lot about the different modes so I tend to shoot in SRAuto which chooses the best everything for you. It does an awesome job!! I have taken pictures in a hotel room at night of my kids with only the hotel lamps and they come out looking great.The auto focus is super quick and I have taken some great shots of birds, kites and other moving objects and gotten great shots.Battery life is great. I can usually get about 400-600 pictures before I need to recharge. That is about 2 days of shooting for me.The flash seems to be really good. I find that when I use the flash the picture really balances the colors and light out well.I also like the dual zoom controls and the rezoom? button, nice feature.The badI find that if I shoot white subjects in bright sunlight they look washed out. I haven't figured out how to adjust the exposure yet.The zoom- On the long end I took some pictures of deer that were really far away and they didn't come out to good. Maybe with time I will figure out how to use the camera better and possibly needed to use a tripod.I am only using this camera for flickr and facebook but the pictures look awesome.I definitely love using this camera and can't wait to find some more subjects in my off time.If you would like to see some pictures check out my flickr.

Bought 2 weeks ago.  Bought because of an upcoming trip to Mt. Rainier and it is weather & sand resistant.  Large bright, clear 3\" LCD screen & viewfinder.  When holding it there is an indent for your right middle finger which makes it more comfortable to hold.  Well thought out design.  I did not find it to be too heavy.  The 50X zoom is real good & fast but need a tripod at 50x - too much shake.  It focuses real fast also.  I like having 2 controls for the zoom and the left one has a speed adjustment.  All the shooting modes work as described.  I am impressed by the Motion Panorama 360 which seamlessly stitches your entire panorama.  The Fisheye under the Advanced filters works well.  So do all the other Advanced filters.  The 1080P HD movie function is crisp & clear, the stereo sound is real good and picks up everything well.  If you zoom while recording you will hear the lens hum.  You'll need to buy a HDMI to Mini HDMI cable to connect to a TV.  I have not tried the WIFI feature yet.If you're new to these advanced cameras, don't worry, just use the SRAuto mode and have fun.  I am very pleased with the camera and would highly recommend it.Note:  You are not told about this until you open the documentation;  if you use the adapter ring AR-S1 (needed for filters), you can not use the lens hood LH-S1 at the same time.  Also, if you use the adapter ring with the protector filter PRF-72, you can not use the lens cap.", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good choice", "Author": "Thiago", "ReviewID": "R65OBCBSU3T8D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My S1 dropped down from a height of approximately five feet and it kept working as well.

The down side is that the Fuji RAW files are not recognized by Adobe Photoshop products. Software provided by Fuji to work on RAW files is OK but does not compare with the capability available with Adobe Photoshop products.Prices do change over time, but I am disappointed in Amazon- This camera is a new model and was out about two months when I ordered it.

The back screen doesn't have sufficient pixels to fully showcase the photos. The EVF also does not have sufficient resolution, and it reminiscent of the 1st generation EFV's of the fuji's X100 camera. I would have preferred that they make the camera more compact, and remove the EVF totally.With regards to image quality, it is decent, however, still a step below cropped sensor DSLR's.Because of the superzoom, the lens is actually pretty long even fully retracted, slightly longer than the length of a 50mm f1.8 lens. This is not obvious from the main product photo because of the angle the main product photo is taken at.The fit and finish of the camera is nice, it has kind of a rubbery texture to the surface. The zoom operates very smoothly, the autofocus is quite good, able to focus in low light conditions pretty well. The grip design is very nice, allowing the camera to be operated one handed pretty easily.At this price point, if you are not in need of a superzoom, I would recommend a used fuji x100, or a fuji xa1, or a fuji xe1. You will get better image quality, and back screen LCD resolutions.To digress, as of today, one of the best compact cameras in the market, which is at an albiet much higher price point, is the fuji T1, which has an absolutely gorgeous EVF, stunning image quality, great LCD screen. (just make sure you get a model without the light leak issue)To summarize, this camera best suited for the budding photographer, who isn't ready to commit to a DSLR or a mirrorless len interchangeable system, who needs a rugged weather sealed camera, with a superzoom.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice features that take a bit of work to figure out", "Author": "S. Siepel", "ReviewID": "R2QQ8BJP3QJEH1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I take a lot of pictures to use on social media both for personally and professionally,  In recent years I have stopped using my SLR, instead using my phone to take pics because of the ease of posting pictures directly from the phone to social media.  Of course, my phone, although it has a nice camera, does not take near the quality of picture that my SLR does. So, I was thrilled to see that Fuji had developed a camera with wireless built-in, making it easy to quickly upload photos to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.  With the app you can transfer your photos wirelessly to your phone or computer and upload them from there.The first thing I did when the camera arrived was do download the Fuji camera remote app onto my android phone. Once downloaded I followed the instructions to connect the phone to the camera, however it just would not connect.  I contacted Fuji and received this instructions:Make sure you downloaded the Fujifilm Camera Remote App.Click on your Wi-FiAccess your advanced optionsRemove the check mark in the Auto network switch optionOnce I did this, the camera app worked beautifully. I did have a friend with an iPhone try the app and he had absolutely no problem connecting to the camera, so it must must just be an android issue.The camera has a nice optical zoom and the ability to take panoramic pictures. Lots of fun settings that I am still playing around with and video as well.This camera is a step in the right direction if you want to take and post nice pictures with ease.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice camera *update*", "Author": "OlyNomad", "ReviewID": "R3OPMBH7IEJ0EP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This will not be a technical review of this camera, this is a review from the standpoint of the average consumer like myself who is looking for a new camera and wanting a camera they can just grab and go with and not mess with a bunch of settings or need advanced knowledge in order to operate it and get nice shots from it.I have a nature blog as a hobby because I enjoy being out in nature and capturing the moments. I'm not a camera expert, it's strictly for fun for me. This camera is ideal for someone like me and is going to move into my top spot in my camera bag.I've been testing it out this last week and I love the results I'm getting.The most important question answered....it takes really good pictures straight out of the box on the auto settings. I took it with me to the park and got beautiful duck shots and then down to the beach and the water shots turned out pretty vivid (partially sunny day).I've taken shots inside and they turn out clear and bright.Beyond the auto settings options, there are additional setting options that give you even better pictures and so easily. The SP (scene position) setting allows you to quickly choose between different scenes...portrait, landscape, sport, night, night tripod, fireworks, sunset, snow, beach, party, flower, text. Fantastic!Even more options are available under the Adv (advanced filter) setting. These are not complicated settings, they are easy to understand and are described on screen and also in more detail in the manual. But you have options like HDR where it prevents washout and captures tonality in bright scenes or Pro low-light which enhances clarity of still subjects in very low light. You have fun options like fish-eye where it creates a distorted effect of a fisheye lens or cross screen that creates a star pattern where lines radiate out from bright objects. They are just a few of the options, there are many to play around with.I like the ease of the menu and settings and how uncomplicated it is to use in general. I had it for two days out taking pictures before I even read any of the manual.I pretty much love everything about this camera and have not ran into anything that I don't like about it. It is perfect for the type of picture taking I do (nature and pets mostly) and I'd recommend it to anyone who asked me what a good camera to get was and just wanted something simple for shots of vacations, nature, hobby, kids etc. It's a really nice camera.As I test it out more, if I do have any additional thoughts or run into any snags, I'll update this review.*Update* After using it a couple months, I dropped a star on it.  I'm having focus issues and so far have not been able to correct it.  It's when I try to focus in on something smaller, not to where I'd use macro, but just a normal shot and it won't focus in on the subject for me. It stays red instead of turning green and focusing in.  I've also had random times where the screen goes green on me while taking pictures (not messing with settings) and I have to turn the camera off and back on again to get rid of the green screen.Still getting nice shots overall, but it does have the occasional hiccup.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm FinePix S1 16 MP Digital Camera with 3.0-Inch LCD (Black)", "Author": "Renata", "ReviewID": "R34XH8IMYQUVWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was recommended to me by a professional photographer.
