Kiefer", "ReviewID": "R1GAP10UDFG5GI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon COOLPIX S510 8 Megapixel Digital Camera - SilverI'm a digital portrait photographer, and I have a DSLR and alot of equipment that I lug around whenever I'm on a shoot. My digital SLR is a workhorse... however, it's heavy and it's an expensive camera (not to mention the lenses that I work with), and it's just not practical or logical to carry it around when I'm not doing a formal shoot with a client.So, I looked into getting a small, compact, and cheap (money-wise) point-and-shoot camera that I could slip into my pocket or my purse for everyday moments, that I could whip out at any second and start taking pictures.I had a Canon SD800 IS for awhile... and while it was an okay camera, it tended to blow out the highlights more often than not... so I searched again... and knowing that Nikon tends to be a bit more conservative with highlights, I came across this little camera, the s510.I didn't need a high-end point-and-shoot. I already have my DSLR, and high end compacts tend to be larger than a pocket... and I wanted something cheap, around $150 or so, and this fit the ticket.The image quality is good, if you're not expecting gallery quality photos, but it's still great for prints up to 8x10, at least... it's great for snapshots of friends, family, kids, pets.... it's an everyday camera. The video quality is something I am impressed with, taking decent sized videos that look great, especially in the right lighting conditions... but the audio is so-so, so if you're looking for a camera that'll take clear sound files, look elsewhere.It is definitely for people with smaller hands... if you have bigger, bulky hands, then you'll find the small buttons annoying, especially the zoom. I'm a young female with average hands, and I don't have a problem with it, but my boyfriend, who has much larger hands, can't stand it.Overall, it's a fantastic camera if you're not expecting miraculous pictures all the time, and if you're just looking for a small (and it is indeed a very, VERY small camera) that you can store in your pocket or purse.I found this review, [...] ,very helpful, if you are interested in this camera.", "Date": "April 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Compact Camera that you can take Anywhere!", "Author": "R. Raymundo \"NikonBob\"", "ReviewID": "R172EPFUD1R1U5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would like to say that this is a first rate compact camera.  I also own the Sony DSC-T200 and I believe that the S510 matches it in image quality.  The photos the S510 takes are also sharper than the T200, but each camera has it's own \"image look\", with the T200 having more saturated colors while the S510 being more conservative in saturation, even with the vivd mode set to \"on\".The S510 is a really excellent performer, with blazing startup time and shutter performance.It might not have the large touchscreen LCD and other \"smily\" features of the T200, but it's smaller and costs a lot less. All in all, a great camera that you can take with you everyday so you never miss a spectacular shot!", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "5 star if you need small", "Author": "LA Meyer", "ReviewID": "RV9Y6T89LX7XJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon S510 is a very good small camera. If you want a small take along camera you can't find a better camera. I took several photos with my Canon S30 and compared them to this camera and the Nikon had better sharpness and depth of field focus at same lighting and same all auto settings. It looks like this camera has been replaced by the S210 which is similar in specs, but sells for a lot less. If you get a good deal on the S510 it still might be a better deal than the S210 since they look like about the same camera. Movies come out great if you like to play with that stuff. If I had to give it a rating comparing it to all the cameras at any price and size it would probably be a 3.8 star, but for a small inexpensive camera it is a 5.", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Coolpix S510", "Author": "M.

We both like the image stabilization feature, particularly in a pocket-sized camera. Camera has the versatility to allow the simplest of high quality point-and-shoot for the beginner, but with the capability to control more of the picture taking process, if desired. Great camera with nice array of features for a fantastic price.", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice compact camera - amazing time lapse", "Author": "Benjamin Stephens", "ReviewID": "R1ADKPPCWDMLG2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for the sole purpose of having a time lapse camera. That is a small feature that is noticeably absent from most point and shoots out there. This feature doesn't disappoint. You can have it automatically record a 30 fps .avi file, or just keep the images from the time lapse separate. I was a little apprehensive that the time lapse was only VGA quality, but with video that's fine. I kind of wish there were an option to take pictures at intervals less than 30 seconds. The camera is smart enough to turn off the display in time lapse to save battery life. I love this feature and it has really opened my eyes to see things in a new light.Other thoughts: VERY noisy above ISO 400. ISO 1600 unusable - unless you're using it to time lapse, at which point the noise is not so noticeable. Don't ask me why I had the ISO kicked up so high since I obviously had the camera stationary, it was a mistake. On that note, this camera does allow you to set the ISO, and of course it does have auto ISO.I like the metal front. I love the very fast startup time. The screen in the back is pretty bad. It really makes images look grainier than they are.I would buy this camera again. Given the features and the low cost, I can get over the bad screen and poor low-light performance. The images are what matters and this camera definitely performs.", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot for Mom", "Author": "Kevin K.
