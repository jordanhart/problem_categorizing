I wanted a camera with a manual mode that allowed me to change the shutter speed, apeture, and ISO of the camera. I also wanted all this with a price that was cheap. This camera fulfilled my expectations and takes quality photos.  Although it feels slightly cheaper, it works well for what I need.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "GE X5 Power Pro Series 14.1 MP Digital Camera 15X Optical Zoom Burgandy Red C...", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A4-CCekaL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006RNNPOC"}}
