This camera, when paired with Oly's best in class primes or even the kit lens, is a real winner. I've produced some 16x20's that are indistinguishable, from my Canon 5D,...no small feat. I also own the EPL1 and 2 and find that the AF on this little jewel to be much faster than the other two. Battery life is also fantastic,seems like I never have to charge it!! The only downside, which has been corrected in the newer models, is the lack of a grip. This was easily corrected by adding a nice ,\"Flipbac\" grip....problem solved.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent for what it is.", "Author": "win32forth", "ReviewID": "R3NSXLMDBKAQFS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Even new the E-PM1 is priced at the low end, and since I purchased this body used it was very inexpensive. After adding a used 14-42mm lens, it is still just under $200. I can't complain about the price, or the performance given the price. To keep the cost down Olympus has eliminated some buttons, which means you have to go through the menus to change a lot of the settings which isn't very convenient, but as a point and shoot replacement it isn't bad at all. Just set it and forget it. I was hoping that it would make a very small carry around camera when paired with the 15mm body cap lens, but the 15mm (30mm equiv) lens doesn't really have good enough image quality, so to get good results you pretty much have to use the 14-42.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great value in a small 4/3rds camera", "Author": "Mark J. Boyd", "ReviewID": "RKO32Y2JUS4WW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the second refurbished Olympus 4/3rds camera body I've purchased from Cameta Camera. In both purchases, the camera bodies looked. were packaged, and performed like they were new. I also purchased an Olympus 4/3rds lens from them. I have been very pleased with all of these purchases. Cameta is my current favourite place to buy camera equipment.I've given the E-PM1 4 stars rather than five stars because its menu system is, at best, confusing. It works very well and is a remarkably small and light 4/3rds camera. Like my other purchases from Cameta, it was an excellent value, well packaged, and delivered quickly.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Refurbished electronics is the way to go", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R3QT6WQUQPBDSU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very hesitant buying refurbished electronics at first, but after my experience with this camera (at Cameta) I will definitely do this again.  With how quickly companies release new models that are only marginally better, I have no problem buying one model back refurbished gear.As far as the camera itself, its a great camera at a great price.  Great size, great feature set, great photos.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect first proper camera", "Author": "Fibinaci", "ReviewID": "R10GK5650QEME7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The E-pm1 is built for people first moving up to proper interchangeable lens cameras from point and shoots and more importantly smartphone cameras. I got this to create photos of my ever increasing family in a way I'll be happy to look at later in life.  The difference in image quality from my Galaxy s3 to this is amazing. If your photos aren't exactly what you want, Olympus has a ton of art and scene modes, which can be applied after the fact, to give them that something extra.The i-auto mode is ready to take you in hand until you learn enough about things like iso, aperture, shutter speed to start controlling those yourself.The kit lens is great and will take care of 66% of the things you'd want to take pictures of, for the rest I really recommend Olympus' 40-150mm zoom lens, which can be had for only $200 new. The other truly recommended accessory is a WiFi memory card(sdhc), when used with the Olympus app on your phone, you can upload photos to the phone straight from our camera, apply scene or art filters there and then send them off to friends and family.Olympus are the kings of small camera design and they kill it here too. Anyone used to smartphone photography will take right off, there is one shutter button on top and a few buttons on back, all of them are programmable so you can set them as you wish. While not pocketable with the lens on, it will fit in a purse, kangaroo pocket, or coat easily.I chose the E-pm1 over the newer E-pm2, or the point and shoot XZ series, due to price mainly, even after kitting it out, I am still well under the price of those cameras. The only people I can see not liking this camera are those with very large hands, for whom the size of this camera will be an issue, and those coming from older cameras who can't compose shots on the screen and need of a viewfinder but can't afford the one Olympus sells separately.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Refurbished - like new", "Author": "John McQuitty", "ReviewID": "R11YQG3SLZBQX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this as a back-up camera for my Panasonic G5, and I'm extremely happy with it.  It is refurbished, but you cannot tell it from a new camera.  All items that came 'in the box' look to be brand new.  The camera has produced excellent pictures.  The interface was a bit different than I expected, but a half hour or so \"playing\" with it and It turned out to be rather simple to use.  Overall, I'm quite happy with this purchase, and with Cameta Camera for their swift service and delivery.  I added a \"Flipbac\" stick on grip (from Amazon), and that improved the handling tremendously.  The camera is small, compact, and has Olympus fast focus system.  Highly recommended.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12.3 Megapixels\n3-inch, Bright Widescreen LCD\nFULL 1080 HD Video\n5 FPS Sequential Shooting\nIn-Body Image Stabilization", "Name": "Olympus PEN Mini E-PM1 12.3MP Interchangeable Micro 4/3 Digital Camera Body with CMOS Sensor, 3-inch LCD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41l5w50U6-L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0090PXQ8Y"}}
