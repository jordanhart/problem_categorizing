Sperling \"daughter of the King!\"", "ReviewID": "R34AETSIT8HST5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got two of these for my niece and nephew.  They took good pictures for what the kids are using them for and I really like the fact that they are not very expensive and better quality than what I was looking at for only a few dollars less.  The 5.1 megapixel gave us the quality for the kids to take picutres and have fun with them on the internet and computer, not great enlargments but it was far better than the Spiderman camera that I almost bought for them.  If you are looking for something that will not break your heart if the kids drop and break a camera, this is the one to get them.My niece and nephew were thrilled with this and enjoy having the freedom to take pictures as they go along.  THey have no compaints.", "Date": "December 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "JUNK!!!", "Author": "Sharon R. Boyd", "ReviewID": "R30S7RJB1B26MF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product is JUNK! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I received this item as ordered for a christmas gift for my grandmother. I thought it would be simple and easy for her to use. Instead, I could have done better buying a camera from a gumball machine! This thing is horrible! I could not even get it to take a single photo. I contacted the shipper and received no reply. I then went to Wal-Mart, bought another camera for grandma and threw this piece of crap in the trash! Not even worth my time to send it back! BEWARE of this item", "Date": "February 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "camera review", "Author": "A.

It was a total waste of money, very dissapointed, just glad it didnt screw my computer up!!!", "Date": "January 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good size and price", "Author": "\"Dorothy Vader\" \"Hyatt\"", "ReviewID": "RZZV6011Q6HV8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Its only major drawback is that it can't zoom. I got it mostly because I needed a camera that fits in my purse. I discreetly took some great pics from within my open purse. It's definitely great when size matters!", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Starter Camera", "Author": "lah93069 \"lah93069\"", "ReviewID": "R1JOHJSYTUTI78", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased 2 of these camera's for my daughters for Christmas. I was a little concerned of the quality due to the low price.  They have turned out to be great cameras.  Both of the girls love them.  The pictures are good quality and it was real easy to learn how to use the functions.", "Date": "January 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not a good camera", "Author": "faerie.friend", "ReviewID": "R2HCPA42VRK90R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a christmas gift for my boyfriend. The camera takes wonderful pictures, but it only takes 3-4 pictures at a time before it needs new batteries. We bought a new box of brand name batteries thinking we just had some previously used batteries, but the same thing happened! We even tried different brands, but nothing helped. Rechargable batteries were even worse. We are in the process of contacting the manufacturer to see what can be done about this problem.Bottom line: Don't buy this camera unless you have a lot of money to throw away on batteries.", "Date": "January 12, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "VUPOINT 3.1MP DIGITAL CAMERA\nDIGITAL CAMERA\nDIGITAL CAMERA sale\ncamera\naffordable camera", "Name": "Vupoint DC-M306AT-VP 3.1Mp Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41OzJf9qXHL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000EIQO80"}}
