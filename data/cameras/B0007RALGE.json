Not only does it take superb hi-res digital pictures, but controls are easy to use.  Most functions are written out in plain English rather than cryptic abbreviations or hieroglyphic icons.  The flexibility to use either preset camera settings for any occasion, or to customize your own if you are a photo pro is another big plus that makes this camera appealing to a wide range of photo enthusiasts.The Kodak EasyShare software that comes with the camera is a bit clunky and overbearing, but it's easy to use and it tracks when you took your pictures and where you downloaded them with relative ease.All in all, this is a great camera to have.  Compact size, simple to use, and a decent sized screen to read clear font text instructions.", "Date": "August 31, 2005"}, {"Title": "great kodak colors!", "Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "RR4AEF5NYIRPT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a solid point and shoot camera.  easy to use, it produces pictures with rich, vibrant tones kodak is famous for.  there is also a printer dock that recharges the batteries (no need to remove the battery--just put the camera on top of the dock).  the dock also prints at the touch of a button.  no computer is necessary, but if you hook the dock to one, you can even send e-mails!  the prints have a clear coat so they don't run or smudge, like some ink jets prints do.anyhow, a great camera at a great price.", "Date": "August 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "The best (top of the line!) camera I have ever had!!", "Author": "T.

You have to know a litte about photography to really get great results from it.  I have a Nikon 3100 and I found it to be a lot easier to use.  You do have a thousand options to work with the Z760, but it does require some basic knowledge about photography.  It's not a \"beginner\" camera.One of the things I love about this camera is the battery life.  I love my Nikon but I hate its batteries life.  The Kodak Z760 battery life is just wonderful.  You don't have to recharge it every time you take pictures using the flash.The picture quality is great.  Overall, it's a great camera.

The Kodak Z760 Easyshare Digital Camera does the trick!I've been a BIG FAN of photography since I was a kid, but never have I enjoyed the flexibility of taking pictures like I have with this one.  The old school way of picture-taking included many wasted dollars on pictures that didn't quite turn out.  With this camera, if you get back picture, just delete it and try again.  INSTANT GRATIFICATION!Plus, you can download the photos to your computer and clean them up easily before printing them out.  In my estimation, you couldn't ask for a better camera than this one.

It's been a great camera and I only got a replacement for it because I wanted to be able to shoot HD video and take wide-angle shots.  It wasn't until I got my new camera that I really began to understand how well the Z760 performs.  My new camera is a Panasonic Lumix ZS7 which on paper is supposed to be far superior to my old Kodak.  This is not the case.  The Kodak has an uncanny ability to shoot high-speed objects in perfect focus, especially in auto-mode.  As an example, this past winter (Feb/2011) I turned and took a picture while running down a snowy hill.  The shot was a picture of my 2 year old son and his little buddy flying down the hill on a sled, and someone running full speed behind them.  You can take this camera and spin around in a room... press the shutter button and it will snap a perfectly focused picture of whatever it was pointing at in that exact moment.  I can't for the life of me get a modern camera to shoot that well in auto mode, let alone messing with shutter speed and ISO.  Even my brother's high-end $600 camera can't do this.  From what I hear, even the new Kodak easyshare cameras can't do it either.  The Z760 was a special camera indeed.It does not do indoor low-light pictures too well, but it's amazing outside and anywhere there is decent light.  It's total crap at a concert, as I've tried using it at several different ones and it did not get great results.  The macro on it is awesome and is one of the features I used most often.  Luckily I didn't sell mine yet, since I will probably be selling my Panasonic and trying to get something that will perform as well as the Z760 but with higher megapixels, zoom and HD video.  My plan is to take a secure digital memory card into Walmart or any other store that lets you check out the cameras and try shooting a few pictures with several different cameras while shaking/waving the camera, among other test shots to determine my next camera purchase.  That way I can take the card home and see how the pics turn out when on a larger monitor for comparison.  The Panasonic Lumix just doesn't take the quality pictures that it's reviews stated it does, and nearly every single action shot is blurred.  This is not good since my 2 year old is rarely still.  Too bad this camera is so outdated.

Anything more would require more light & set off the flash, which would scare wildlife.  It has a viewfinder which is also necessary when shooting wildlife.
