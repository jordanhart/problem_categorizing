{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lightning-Fast processor, far superior lower-light images with faster shutter speed.", "Author": "Handy Home Helper \"Dale\"", "ReviewID": "R1DJ9TWJ7JS8UL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Firstly, shutter speed is LIGHTING fast, providing you don't have too much for the camera to do.  True it's faster than any other to date in fully automatic mode, but when you select \"Custom\" and choose fewer tasks for it to calculate, it's much faster than the \"normal\" mode.  In auto mode flash is either \"off\" or \"auto\"...no \"on\" when you know you need faster shutter speed and are in borderline low light with movement.  We take a lot of kid/dog impromptu photos, which often happen spur of the moment, and the need to manually \"click\" open the flash, then turn the dial to make sure you're in \"Custom\" mode so the flash will be manually forced to be on...by then the thing you want to shoot is long gone.  Ideal would be fully automatic with an \"ON\" mode for flash, which will simply flip up on it's own when you shoot (if you've forgotten to manually engage it).Otherwise, the camera functions are far more than we need, great capacity for fully HD videos, multiple output modes, and one thing we haven't tried yet...WiFi data transfer to PC's, Tablets or wherever you need to send your photos.  A cool function to be sure, as long as we can figure it out!The owner's manual is nearly 300 pages...just in English...so don't be expecting an \"EASY\" camera.  Just a really great portable for great photos.  One note is the lower light \"auto\" seems to have a much brighter result with fewer blurry images as our last Canon PowerShot from a couple years ago.  So shoot away, and have fun with it!", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Small Camera with a Lot of Capability", "Author": "John T. Gaffield \"John T. Gaffield\"", "ReviewID": "R3TFF8TUC92Q1P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this camera kit from Beach Camera through Amazon. First, I wanted to say I am happy with Beach Camera. I ordered the camera on a Wednesday and it was shipped the same day. I received it that Friday with the normal shipping method. So it arrived very quickly. The kit is about the same price as the camera alone and I thought this would be a good deal. The items are decent quality. The SD card is a Sony brand. It is nice having an extra battery. The only thing I may not use much would be the case, since it is relatively large for this size of camera.I am impressed with the camera so far. I have been learning how to use it, but it is not real difficult, since I already have a Canon A570 IS. The low light images seem to work very well, since this has up to ISO 12800 capability. I have taken several indoor shots, but have yet to use the flash. This was one of the main reasons I wanted to get a better camera and this do fit what I was looking for. The size is nice for what I need at this time. I was considering a DSLR, but I was not sure if I needed something that size at this point. This does have similar functionality of the DSLR in a smaller package. The image quality is impressive. As long as you stay within the optical range, the quality remains when you zoom in or crop a photo.I am looking forward to continue to explore the functions of this camera and use it on trips and other times.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome!!", "Author": "Simone", "ReviewID": "RX5CZVBFYJA9M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If i had bought this camera from someone Else i would have to pay the same amount for just the s120, in this set there are so Many exstra things!
