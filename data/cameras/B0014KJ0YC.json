Installation was simple, although I have had previous experience with automotive wiring.  The instructions are sparse, so it might be harder for the inexperienced.The range of the remote is very good.  I was pleased with the features this alarm has.  I've added power door locks to the car and have 2 auxiliary  control functions left in-case I want to add a trunk pop or remote start.you will need to purchase some relays to get all of the functionality of this alarm working.I also added an audio trigger from Directed Electronics to this alarm by splicing it into the shock sensor wires - just match the colors and it works perfectly!", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice alarm but remote is too fat", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R2DQHE39D8Q3Z8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The alarm system is great and the siren is super loud.
