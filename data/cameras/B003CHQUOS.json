The whole casing is plastic, so from a closeup it does look fake.  However, I placed them 15 feet high so it does look real.  The LED is very bright and you can see it in the daytime.  I'm guessing the battery life will only be a couple of month.  I recommended that if you place it up high then this is an excellent buy.  However if you are placing only a few feet high, then but the SVAT ISC200 Outdoor Imitation Security Camera with Blinking LED that cost almost twice as much.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Hey for 10 bucks waddaya want?", "Author": "REN", "ReviewID": "R1FWN12HJSNTW2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought a bunch of these and installed high up.  Did not bother with the batteries because if you think I am going up on the ladder to replace batteries when they drain, ain't gonna happen.  They do look REAL ENOUGH.  MOST cheap real cameras are in plastic bodies anyway.  IF someone want to break into your house they will real camera/no camera/fake camera.  Matters not.  But it is cheap peace of mind.  The stickers are a nice touch as well.  Would have given 5 stars if the batteries were easy to replace.  They are NOT.  Leave em out.
