Tolliver \"Ivy's Mom\"", "ReviewID": "R3JHYBA3UXZ4XV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my 17 year-old son who is quite tech savvy (compared to myself). I've read the previous reviews about \"grainy\" pics, but once you figure out how the make adjustments the pictures come out just fine. It takes good pictures, has a decent enough zoom lense, and allows him to edit photos on the camera.  It has a lot of other options to that he seems to be quite happy about. He carries it to school daily and is always taking pictures of friends and such and they upload directly to his computer via a USB cable. He doesn't use the camera box since he carries the camera around like his cell phone, and he gave the crayons to his 3 year-old sister. Two gifts in one! LOL. The camera is very easy to use and I'd recommend it for someone just starting out using ditigal cameras, or someone in HS or junior high who takes daily random shots of a bunch of other teens/friends.", "Date": "December 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great except for the slow shutter!", "Author": "James Price", "ReviewID": "RMHSJYE3U93ER", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall I like the camera and the quality of the photos. The camera is easy to operate. The buttons are clear and simple. The only problem I have is when trying to take pictures of something that moves. The slow response time from the time you press the button until the shutter closes is so slow that I cannot take pictures of the baby, for example. Children move so quickly that I can never capture the shot I want: the baby has already moved, or his eyes are closed, or the smile is gone - it just loses the spontaneity.", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "You can't go wrong with this, seriously ... extremely pleased!", "Author": "Lyrce", "ReviewID": "R2335H0AKR242B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a lot of camera for your money.I was pleasantly surprised at the features and photo quality for this price.Ordered the black; got the aqua blue - not a big deal to me as I am not taking photos of the camera. It's cute, actually. Couldn't find the xd adapter card at first, -argh!-, but it (little orange thing) turned up in the larger box with the case (black) and crayons, whew! Put in a 4G micro card; after changing the compression to \"fine,\" which I always use, it reported I had room for 500 pictures - half the number you can fit at \"normal\" compression. Use \"fine\" for everything. You can definitely see the difference in the quality of your photos.I am still exploring all the features of this camera. The scene modes are a nice timesaver, and the magic filters - did not expect that! -  are quite fun. The movies with sound do NOT lose audio when you zoom, despite reports to the contrary, but naturally you can hear a click. It is easy to operate, and the photos are vibrant and crisp and full of detail. Now, you would not use this to photograph a wedding, but for everyday, walkaround, wow, look at that! use it is pretty hard to beat.Yes, it is a bit \"plasticy,\" but not flimsy - and plastic also makes it very light. Get batteries in a drugstore in a pinch. Big, bright, clear LCD monitor. The pictures are perfectly focused if you take the picture correctly - wait for the green focus box to appear. (I have yet to see a blurry one .. I RTFM.) And unlike your average fancycam, it arrives with a sturdy if simple padded case, so you just throw it in your bag and go. No worries. No $25 for a case either. And my nieces and nephews will all love the coloring stuff.Great purchase. Very happy. Get yourself one.", "Date": "July 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Grreat starter camera", "Author": "C. Jensen", "ReviewID": "R1EWFHQELU4AKB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great little camera for the price.  Takes great pictures.  One pro is the use of regular AA batteries - no need to recharge a special battery.  One con - does not seem to play back videos on the camera with sound.  You must go through computer or TV to hear audio.  But overall, a good starter camera for teens.", "Date": "May 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Camera is OK..", "Author": "Jessica Kelley \"jk\"", "ReviewID": "R1YX30B7YWZA12", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is ok. The actual pictures don't turn out to good for it being a 11 megapixel. I bought it for the crayola feature but wish i wouldve gotten a kodak camera instead. Good for teens and young adults. Not good for adults wanting to caputure good pictures of kids and sports!!", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Melanie Billiu", "ReviewID": "R2BYHX5AGSZK7S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My daughter loves this camera.  She loves the fact that she can print the picture and then color it herself.  She is always using it.  I am not a fan of the box, I would have preferred something a little more sturdier due to the fact that it was supposed to be a keepsake box.", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "FE 46", "Author": "Forestry Major", "ReviewID": "R3A6P158V6BTTD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "good camera especially for the price makes a good gift and is great for taking pictures of the family and such but its not a camera for more advanced users. but if you need a camera to take simple picture and even short video of friends and family this will do the job nicely.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrible photos", "Author": "Kelly K", "ReviewID": "RXOZNJTYR4OKW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera so that we would have a small camera that took videos and took photos.

I wish I had bought something else.  My boys are 3, 8 and 10 and this camera has a hard time capturing a picture of them without blurring.  Also, I notice it has a really hard time if you are not in direct sunlight.  We recently were in the redwood forest in the middle of the day, but very shady and I could NOT get a good picture on ANY setting.  I typically have to take several pictures to get one that is not blurry or clear.  Never had this problem with other cameras, so I wouldn't call it operator error.  I think I'm just going to give it to my kids.  Very disappointed.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Value-priced camera", "Author": "X742W4DP \"CW04(DP)USN, Ret.\"", "ReviewID": "R2JXRJOV3KKB19", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This Olympus FE-46 was a replacement for an equally value-priced GE camera which broke when I pressed hard on the LCD screen. The MENU function \"buttons\" are ICONS on the LCD screen and takes awhile getting used to. It takes average quality pictures and below average quality in bright sunlight. The videos are below average quality because most video clips turned out to be over-exposed. The video segments can only be 10 seconds long, so I have to take several 10-second segments to finish a long session. It takes better pictures and videos than a camera-phone, and considering the price I paid for it, I consider it a good buy.", "Date": "July 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "Julie E.
