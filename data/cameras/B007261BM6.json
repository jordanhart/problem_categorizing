I use it mostly to take listing photos for eBay, but I have gotten good results outside too, Macro shots are good, as are ladnscapes.  Only a 5X zoom so don't expect much telephoto.F 2.5 is helpful, I don't know what the other reviewers are complaining about.

It was on sale and the last one. At the price of $49.00 I could not resist.In three weeks it proved to be one of the best cameras I have (8-digital and 3-35mm).No comprehensive manual included, but the control buttons will reveal all the functions. The build-in software will be offered for installation at the first connection to a PC or a laptop.I tested the camera in different light conditions from bright sunny days to late evenings, outdoors and indoors, macro and zoom with impressive results.Pros:The footprint of the credit card and size Motorola Razr phone.The selection of menu, mode and functions is equal or better than most the cameras of much higher price.Near perfect optics with F-2.5 brightness (98% of all digital cameras have an F-3.5-4.5 initial opening) lens deliver life like colors and great depth perception.In the \"Smart Auto\" mode the camera is doing a great job for point and shoot, \"off the hip\" situations.In the \"Program\" mode all the functionality is offered in a wide array of configurations to choose from.With 16Gb Micro card there is enough space for nearly 2000 16Mp pictures or over 1 hour of HD 30fp/s of video.The camera is always with me in my Razr phone belt case.Cons:Are you kidding me???", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Clear, stunning, and beautiful!", "Author": "Christie G.", "ReviewID": "R2C7HG1H111H10", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an experimental camera artist that likes to take random fun pictures.I've done amateur photography and did some professional events.Normally I would prefer canon cameras, as I have a few, but I decided to give this camera a try.I bought this camera, because I didn't want to lug around my dslr, especially when taking a quick out of town vacations,and the fact that it was on sale for one day at a store and I gave it a try.I'm super happy that I did!I like the fact that the ISO settings are from 80 - 3200, and that it has an image stabalizer.You can also play with the different settings too.I've played with all of the settings and did random test shots.This camera also has HD 720p and the video is pretty clear, compared to other point and shoot cameras that I've tried before.One thing about this camera too, is that when you plug the camera into a usb port in the computer, you have the option to install a photo editor that comes free.I have professional photography editing software already installed on my computer, but the photo editor that comes with this camera is simple and right to the point.It's good for beginners!The pictures comes out stunning and very clear!Beautiful colours are rich quality too!I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone, as this camera is very good quality made!I'm seriously happy with this camera!", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "camera", "Author": "trish", "ReviewID": "R3K0P3QHD2WHRL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this camera is so great its the best camera i hav gotten for this price quality of pictures is amazing,,,,,love just love it", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "BUY A MICRO SD CARD NOT A REGULAR SDHC", "Author": "Brent L.

All he told me was that he (a) liked the features, and (b) it gets the job done for his incessant E-Bay sales postings.  He is a very burly man with exceptionally thick fingers (picture a bear of a man) and the one draw back was the small size of the camera.  However, when I suggested he invest in a stylus, he said that he could still access the feature buttons without the assistance of a stylus.

I just went to use it for the third time a week ago and it wouldn't turn on. I plugged it in to make sure that the battery was fully charged and still it didn't work. I then proceeded to plug it into my laptop to charge it to see if maybe the charger was bad. After leaving it overnight to charge from my laptop it still didn't turn on. Then, I bought another battery to see if maybe the battery wasn't taking a charge. After charging that battery fully, it still didn't turn on.
