Great features, and it makes manual settings relatively easy. I suggest getting to know it and practicing with the settings. THe touch screen can be a little... touchy, but you can turn it off. The wifi feature is nice, and if you download the Samsung camera app to your smartphone, you can send pix right to your phone even without wifi - as long as they're close to each other. Great zoom, and great quality photos.If you're going to be doing the tourist thing anywhere, I highly recommend this - Hakuba USA Inc Dns629 Neck Strap For Use With Digital Camera: Hakuba USA Inc Dns629 Neck Strap For Use With Digital Camera", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent camera", "Author": "Rolando De S", "ReviewID": "R3VOVJ7UR10SXQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the camera is nice and good. ideal size.good zoom, user-friendly menu.The kit bag is large and comes many accessories.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Extra kit", "Author": "Alfred Hentze \"alfred\"", "ReviewID": "REIQ0FFX5TEZH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The 8gb memory stick that came with the kit didn't work, (it is the cheapest chinese thing), it says it comes with a USB, it is not, it is a thing to insert the memory stick, the camera case is not like the one on the picture here, it is a bigger case to put everything inside, I was expecting a \"case for the camera\" as shown here.
