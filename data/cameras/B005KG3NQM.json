This one is truly out of the box charge it up and you are ready to shoot.ONE VERY *VERY* IMPORTANT NOTE -it does NOT ship with a SDHC card- PLEASE do yourself a favor and be sure you have one . Though I cant imagine needing one this size, it will take up to a 32GB card.

Not only do I HATE it, but it went $20 lower a couple weeks ago! Wish I had returned it right away. The response time is really slow, after you take a picture it takes a couple seconds to get the screen back so you can take another. This camera has some great features but I'm sick of seeing the \"processing\" screen. Also, the low lighting settings are horrible! I had to go in manually to change them as the flash washes EVERYTHING out. I bought this camera because a friend of mine has a Kodak and it seems to be really nice, but this one is awful!

In August 2012, the LCD stopped working.  She used it, gave it to me, I put it down on a table, came back later and the LCD was not working.  Well, not a big deal, that is why there is a warranty.I called Kodak, and returned it to them (my expense) and about a week later they replied that I voided the warranty because it was \"bumped\" and the LCD was supposedly cracked.  There is no way to prove or disprove this, as it is their word against mine.  Now I am being told that for $50 they will replace the screen.  Why would I spend $50 to replace a screen on a camera that I spent $70 on to buy new?If this is the quality of their craftsmanship, no wonder they went bankrupt!  I have had digital cameras from other companies that survived a tour in Iraq, and years of use while no showing any signs of problems.

After reading the reviews, this seemed like a good fit. I did not want to spend too much on a camera, but I also wanted to make sure I got a good product. My niece LOVES this camera. She is practicing taking pictures with it. As with anyone who is first starting to learn how to use a digital camera, many of her photos are a bit blurry, but the pictures that I take seem to be very good quality, and the camera has a decent amount of zoom (at least enough for the current owner). You definitely need to purchase a separate memory disk for this camera; without a memory disk, this camera can only hold about 12 photos. My niece REALLY likes the \"share\" functions, since you can easily plug in the camera to a computer and instantly add your photos to social-networking sites and online photo journals. That said, we had a serious discussion about the quality and type of photos that she can take and how, once it's online, you can never truly delete a picture. Finally, the camera can also take short videos, but there is no audio. My niece has not used this function very much because she prefers to have audio with her video.
