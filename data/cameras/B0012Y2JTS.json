It takes very good pictures in all light situations, but is especially good in low light when compared to other digital cameras.  I brought this along on a recent outing to New York City and didn't use the flash at all.  As with all cameras, not every picture taken in low light is perfect, but this camera does a better job than any other camera I have owned which includes other Sonys.  It is about the size of a deck of cards, so although it is larger than some cameras in Sony's lineup, it is still small enough to fit into your jeans pocket without feeling like the whole world knows what you are carrying.", "Date": "June 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing - another great Sony!", "Author": "DocRWM \"docrwm\"", "ReviewID": "R3APGXE1EKLT5T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the 6th Sony camera of camcorder that we've owned.  My wife wanted a slim camera to carry in her purse for shots of the children at outings and such.  We already own the Memory Stick media and NP-BG1 batteries and chargers so a Sony that uses these was our first choice.  No one, NO ONE, else had the new DSC-W150 or W170s on discount other than Amazon when we bought ours.  The Smile technology and child first choice are AMAZING.  The quality of the pictures is terrific but the ease of point and shoot with presets or all auto is great for pull it out on the spur of the moment, turn it on (fast), point and shoot!  The quality of the Very Fine movies is also really amazing.  I know that its still 640x480 video but 30fps and the speed of the new Mark 2 cards makes this usable footage - its not the same as our Sony DVCs but its good enough and its with us ALL THE TIME!  Wow.  Great 5x optics, wider angle than the W150 (which is nice as many slim cameras make it hard to do photos of groups unless you are way back), and it uses the NP-BG1 and newer NP-FG1 battery packs so its compatible with our DSC-H7 and its support materials!!UPDATE: Nov 12, 2008:Well, we've had it for several months and two big trips.  We took over 2000 photos with it during our week at Walt Disney World.  I also had my Sony DSC-H7 with us.  After the first day and comparing the two sets of photos that evening, I carried the W170 for the rest of the trip.  Its SO much smaller, took great photos, and was easier to use (also was easier on the battery) that I took more photos than I otherwise would have with the bulkier camera.  The Videos, when converted with Vista to DVD, are AMAZING!  Are they as good as our Digital Video tape Sony?  No, but then again this camera is 1/10th the size!  Just plain impressed with the performance of this little camera.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "poor image quality, but otherwise very nice", "Author": "Ed Sejud", "ReviewID": "R39A6OV0QRGW24", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because the consumer reviews were excellent, and my first impression of the camera was very good also, based on size, handling characteristics, and the way photos displayed on the 2.7\" screen on the back of the camera.  However I had business distractions and didn't display my photos on a full-size screen until after the Amazon return time expired. The image quality of my camera (perhaps I have a lemon) is very poor when compared to my three year old Olympus point-and-shoot.  I was shocked at how \"soft\" the images were when viewed on a 15\" computer screen.  I took identical comparison shots using a tripod and self-timer to verify that I wasn't seeing motion, but in sunlight or low light, the images are visibly and objectionably soft.  Around bright patches, such as sky showing through the leaves a tree in the foreground, there is heavy blue fringing, and some sections of the photos are \"foggy\" as though a fingerprint was on the lens, but there were no fingerprints or debris on the lens.  There are noticeable blotches of off-color (like \"noise,\" but bigger) in shadow areas, even at low ISO.  I should have tested the camera better, sooner, and I blame myself and my schedule for not doing that.  Here is the lesson:  (1) Don't buy a camera unless you can thoroughly test it immediately, including judging the image quality on a large screen, not the screen on the camera. (2) Order the correct memory chip the first time, so you don't get delayed waiting for the correct chip to arrive. This Sony is not compatible with all SD memory chips. (3) Compare the camera against another camera of known qualities, but do in time to take advantage of Amazon's return option.  I've shipped my camera to the repair center in Texas and it hasn't returned yet.  If they fix it satisfactorily, I'll amend this evaluation to say so.OCTOBER 17, 2008 UPDATE:  The camera was promptly returned from Sony service in Texas with no notation or explanation regarding what repair, if any, was done.  The post-return images seem very much like the former ones I complained about.  However, I have softened my criticism a bit because I think my original expectations were too high.  This is a quite small, light, easily carried and concealed camera with intuitive controls and it has a reasonable optical viewfinder.  For it's size, it does the job well enough, so, in retrospect, I think I was expecting a bigger camera's performance from an instrument I purchased on account of it's very small size.  That expectation might have been unreasonable in some degree. I also have a Canon G10, which costs twice as much and is two and a half times heavier.  The Canon takes lovely pictures, but I find myself carrying around the Sony most often because it is so small and so light (6 oz. with battery), which is a compelling argument in its favor.", "Date": "August 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Way To Go Sony!", "Author": "Brandie Woodward \"Spock4Pres818\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q3A32UBGQF1R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my Sony Cybershot today to replace my horrible Casio Exilm, that I was so disappointed in.  I took this out of the box, and I immediately loved it before even putting the battery in.  It is the perfect size.  I myself don't like the extremely thin cameras.  I find them more difficult to get a good grip on to take a good photo.  This is very comfortable to use, and I love how easy the controls are and the handy dial to change the photo settings.  It is still small enough to fit in your pocket.  The color is so nice.  Just so you now it is not really red, it is more of a magenta or deep pink color.  So, if you want a deep red color, you might be disappointed.  I took some test photos of my cats, and I loved them.  They were ten times clearer then they would have been on my Casio camera.  The color came out so nice.  The video  is nice too.  I like also you just pop the battery out to charge, and the charger is not big and bulky with a long cord.  You just plug the battery in, and the whole charger just plugs into the wall.  I have a mac so I didn't need to use the software or install anything for it, so I cannot comment on installation, but I am sure it is not a big deal if you have a PC.  It works great with iPhoto.  The only thing I was disappointed in, is that you cannot adjust the zoom when filming in video mode.  I am so happy with my choice, and I am selling Casio camera on Ebay.

Great low-light capability, zoom of 5x is very useful (and the wide 28mm is good), nice pocketable size, good control layout, fast response for shooting and playback even with the high 10.1 megapixel, good screen clarity, (but wierd slight lag in \"focusing\" in reviewing - why?).  Also selected this because one of the last remaining series with an optical viewfinder for when it is very bright outside or when my reading glasses are not handy, (just wait- it will happen to you too).  I think only Canon still has optical viewfinder models available.  Viewfinder is  only approximate of real view at various zoom levels, but errors on side of giving more than you see, which is good - you can always crop later.  But my real beef is that with all of this face and smile detection junk, (come on, do you really need a smile detection with such settings as child vs. adult, etc?), they should have kept some way to choose aperture or shutter priority.  As a minimum, there should have been a \"sports\" or \"action\" mode and a \"near & far focus\" mode.  Anyway the camera is fast (high EV), so in many cases, action blur is not a huge problem.  The shutter button is elongated and you need to be pretty well centered on it for proper actuation - surprising quality design slip for Sony.

I went with the W150, but I tried this one out while I was comparing the two, and since I don't see any reviews for this product yet, thought I could help out with what I know about this product.This camera has a slightly wider lens (28mm) than the W150 (30mm).  Another difference is that the W170's battery power is marked on its retail box as slightly less efficient than the W150's.Obviously the main reason this camera is more expensive than the W150 is because it goes up to 10.1 megapixels, while the W150 only goes up to 8.1.  More megapixels in the 8-10 scale shouldn't be a big concern, because unless you are taking large scale poster pictures you don't necessarily need a camera with a megapixel rate of over 5 megapixels.  I tend to keep my megapixel setting low because when the photos are uploaded to a computer, I don't like dealing with large file sizes.  However, I suppose having the option for that extra megapixel setting can be good to have, in case you would like to take a large cropped picture.Overall, when I was testing out the camera I didn't find it to be really any different than its counterpart, the W150.  Besides what I mentioned above, it's virtually the same; 5x optical zoom, optical viewfinder, 2.7\" screen, same camera settings.  Pretty much it comes down to how many megapixels you want, and contrary to the popular belief, the average camera user doesn't need double digit megapixels.  I bought the W150 simply because I didn't think the 2mm additional lens width and 2 extra megapixels that came with the W170 were enough to shell out an extra 50 bucks.  Still, if you feel you want those slight upgrades, then by all means I'd say buy this camera.  I enjoyed using it, I just didn't see the need for those slight upgrades when the W150 suited me fine.", "Date": "May 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Yes another sony", "Author": "Skullie \"AmericanEuro\"", "ReviewID": "R3PX3B1HE9NP9J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my Canon SD700IS which i was never very happy with.

I especially like the viewfinder, so that in sunlight, you can see your subjects easier. I purchased a Canon Powershot A720 IS, but sent it back, as the viewfinder and actual view were miles out. Unacceptable by Canon's standards I believe. This Sony is more expnsive, but a better performer. Thr viewfinder is not perfect, but more accurate than the Canon. One doesn't expect single lens reflex standards, but the Sony is good. Using the viewfinder, you need to get as much as you can in the view itself though. The camera manual is only on the CD, but there is a brief version in paper. The sensor seems pretty good tp me, and the preview screen has a high refersh rate (I believe that is the correct saying...)

Spence", "ReviewID": "RO48L7LU95AJD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this from BestBuy just because I didn't want to wait for shipping and I needed a camera this weekend. Anyway, after going through a few Kodak digital cameras, first a 5 MP and then a 8mp I upgraded to this wonderful Sony 10mp that is just fantastic. I had it out of the box and taking pictures within 5 minutes. I posted a fantastic picture of a butterfly under product images. That was taken impulsively in easy mode.I love the smart smile technology, what a spectacular idea that was. To those of you who are unfamiliar with that technology as I was smile shutter will wait for the subject being photographed to smile. It displays a smile meter and when the perfect smile is made it knows just when to take the perfect shot - it's awesome if you learn to use it correctly.I also appreciate the fact it has built in slide show feature with music. The single USB & A/V cord makes it easy to connect to a computer or a TV. At first I did not know if I liked the fact that I could not choose the perfect scene mode but I will tell you that this is one smart camera and consistently and flawlessly will choose the best conditions to shoot the picture.This also comes with a rechargeable battery with charging station that is a sure winner. The only thing I can think of that I wish this had was a Panoramic mode that \"stitched\" together multiple photos like my kodak did on board the camera. But thats what photo editing software is for I guessI also enjoy messing around with black and white photographs. If you place this in personalized mode and select B&W; color mode it will take B&W; photos that will blow you away.Bottom line: If you are considering a camera that is above a entry level camera but not quite a SLR but is capable of producing \"WOW\" photographs, go to an electronic store and give this one a try, you probably will not be disappointed.ADDED AFTER 3 MONTS OF OWNING:Still am happy with this camera. One drawback is although it has a lot of buttons and features which I enjoy, there are stff limits as far as shooting your pictures in a manual mode. Also, I am having trouble in almost any mode of the camera noticing different shades of red. E.g. if shooting a red flower with all red leafs but at different depths, the camera just sees a blob of red. Now having it, I sill like it lots, might drop to 3.5 to 4 out of five on stars. Still worth looking at but I may have bought a SLR camera though more expensive, but I do like this size. I am torn on my review of this. In ways I enjoyed my 8mp Kodak better. Also, no panoramic mode on the sony.****4/2010 UPDATE****I still love this camera! It has become my baby. I purchased a spare battery pack and with two I never run out of juice. I also purchased a Nikon D60 (DSLR) camera and extra lenses. Why am I telling you this? Because I still find myself grabbing this Cybershot when I run out the door. I recently took a trip to Las Vegas and brought only this Sony. I left the Nikon at home because of it's size and price is something happened to it while in Vegas. Anyway my point: when I returned home I posted my photos on my [...] site and a few days later a friend of mine who happens to be a amateur photographer complimented me on my night shots of Vegas. He started inquiring into the settings I was using and I realized he thought I had used my professional Nikon camera to take these pictures. He was shocked when I confessed that the pictures he liked were from a hand held point-and-shoot camera.The overall point I am trying to make is at first I wished there were more buttons and configurations to play with. Now however I see the ease of simplicity and how beneficial that can be. I have also learned that if you take care of this camera, it will last years and I also think having to use 'Sony parts\" such as batteries, memory sticks, seem to also be nice because everything works flawlessly together, consistently.Complaints: Still wish it had a panoramic mode that 'stitches' a series of usually 3 photos together such as available in Kodak and others.Other note: after using a Nikon D60 DSLR I have noticed that the sharpness on the Sony is not quite as good as a higher priced or quality camera but don't misinterpret that because the Sony does take great clear, sharp pictures, I am talking about being able to see the fuzz on a plant leaf or something that small. I developed, or I guess 'printed' is the proper term now, 300 pictures just to have hard copies, just at my local Wal-Mart because its cheap, and they all came out just as good as any film camera (not professional level) I have ever owned - just to clarify.Also, 8/10 times I find myself using this over my Nikon D60 as I can just grab it, put it in jacket/pocket and go. Very easy to travel with!!!************10/2010 UPDATE *****************Still love this camera - have been looking at some of the newer models coming out for point-and-shoot cameras but I must say this has held up very well and still works like new. I have taken this camera to biology and anatomy lab for school and it's been spectacular. After having this for a few years now, I know I got my money worth out of this product!

I tried all of the cameras at best buy side by side. When taking a photo inside with a flash, many cameras, including my old canon made everyone look white and washed out while the background was very dark or even blank. Not on this baby. The color, indoors and out, foreground and background really seems well lit and very even in tone.ConsLose the smile thing, both for picture taking and editing.  The one in editing is just creepy looking.Want really creepy photos? Make the person have a smile intensity of 5, and then do it again and again and again..... It looks like a worm stretched across their face. Also doesn't detect faces if they have mustaches.This seems designed for a lot of portraits, but I like landscapes and sports events.Where is the panoramic stitch type help? One of the cameras out on the market right now has it where they show a little bit of a ghost image of the last shot to help line up the panoramic shot.  Even my cameras that are 5-10  years old had something for panoramic.Can't they add the little plastic thingy that tightens around your wrist so you don't loose this $300 gem?Why no sport mode?I want pics of kids at their sporting events and such, still trying to figure out how to take good photos inside with poor lighting and speedy kids at volleyball. They are ending up blurry.  I am sure there is a setting that will work, just not sure what it is yet.I do like how some of the other models have lenses that don't stick out and move, so particles don't get caught in them.Why does the underwater case cost nearly as much as the camera?Looking for a good blog to learn tricks about my new toy...", "Date": "September 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Little Camera", "Author": "TheNewJane", "ReviewID": "R2FDCJZEWLS1K5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this little camera for a couple of weeks now, taking photos daily.

It produces very beautiful photos of architectural and landscape subjects; it is harder to use for good photos of people because of the inherent delay of a fraction of a second between composing the picture and actually capturing it.  One comes away with more respect for the daguerrotype photographers, whose models had to be still for minutes, not just a fraction of a second.  It is annoying that it is not shipped with at least a one GB memory chip; the chip is a separate purchase, from a separate supplier.

Most people writing reviews here are amateurs (since only an amateur would buy this camera) and don't realize just how awful this camera's images are.  I bought this camera for my sister after insufficient research, only to be shockingly disappointed.The images are simply incredibly noisy, and Sony tries to cover up this massive shortfall by adding massive amount of digital \"noise correction.\"  What causes all this noise?  This is simply a bad camera with a very insensitive CCD.In very bright light, you will see noise even in darker colors.In medium light or with a flash, you will see noise in all shades except whites and the brightest colors.  This is how most of your pictures will look, like junk.In low light, the noise problem is so overwhelming that \"noise reduction\" kicks in, trying to hide the fact that this is a poor quality camera.  The \"noise reduction\" basically makes the image look like a pastel painting, and removes pretty much all the fine and even not-so-fine detail.The end result is you will get less detail with this \"10 megapixel\" camera than I did with an Canon 4MP camera 6 years ago.  If I had to rate the image quality, I'd say the camera takes pictures with about as much detail as a decent 3 MP camera.The build quality is also lacking and unsophisticated.

To resolve the issue with the trick of going up to ISO400- sometimes it works, sometimes it does not! The high ISO already starts to demand ist contribution and as a matter of fact its more a matter of luck than something you have control over.

It's trading off the blurring of a slow shutter with the blurring from putting pixels together to get enough light.The camera also gives you some control of the processing through the \"Program Auto\" mode, where you have access to settings like ISO (film speed).  When I switch from Auto Adjustment to Program Auto and set the film speed to 80, which forces the camera NOT to sum pixels (much), the resolution of the image is quite visibly improved.  Because I've slowed the camera down, though, using this setting frequently requires a tripod.  I get acceptably sharp images in natural light when using ISO 80, and if necessary can experiment with turning off other corrections like the Dynamic Range Optimizer.With all that said, I got this camera for snapshots and for that purpose it cannot be beat.  Yes the softening of the pictures gets worse in low light (pixel summing again) but the camera gets good pictures in ridiculously low-light situations.  I have found virtually no situation in which I could not get the shot, in natural light, no matter how little of that there is.The camera is pocketable, slim, lightweight, and that automatic optimizing means it's always good for the shot.

I was very unhappy with my photos until I stopped using most of the automatic functions.  I recently took the camera on a hike and took over 200 shots, of which 15 were out of focus (most at 5X).  Wide-angle shots with this camera came out great.  I only shoot in Program Mode, with ISO set at 200 to force the camera to use a faster shutter speed.  I use central point autofocus, and almost always use the 2-second Self Timer, particularly at 5X.  The lens on this camera has great depth of field, so scenic shots are quite impressive.  I only use the Normal color setting, because the Vivid setting is total overkill.  I do not use the Auto White Balance either; I set it to the type of light which is present.If you are a casual shooter, you will probably be dissatisfied with this camera.  I can't understand why Sony didn't do better testing before releasing this model.  I don't care if it has a 9-point focus system;  I'd rather have 1 point that works than 9 that don't.

I'm simply thrilled by the sharpness and quality of the pictures this compact camera captures! At the highest resolution, the amount of detail this camera picks up is phenomenal (as long as you're in a sufficiently illuminated setting).There are three major reasons why I picked the Sony DSC-W170 over other brands/models of cameras. (1) This camera has a 28 to 140mm wide angle lens to capture a wider field of view for establishing the context of the subject or subjects in the shot. (2) The 5x optical zoom lens enable impressive close-ups (3) The image stabilization helps to keep your subject properly framed even if you have shaky hands like mine.The camera also takes macro shots. The clarity, sharpness, and detail of the macro shots is astounding. I'm having a lot of fun with this - You can actually get real creative with this!You can also take videos at 30 fps (480 x 640 resolution) with this camera. I should caution you about an inaccuracy in the product description. As of this writing, the product description reads \"the length of your video limited only by the capacity of your media.\" DO NOT BE MISLED! Like all point-and-shoot cameras that are video-capable, the length of the video on the DSC W-170 is limited to 10 minutes. You would need to restart the video after every 10 minutes if you wish to continue shooting.The Sony Cybershot is, of course, not exempt to the problem that's inherent in all compact cameras -- \"noise\" in low light conditions. The problem is more pronounced in compact cameras than in dSLR cameras.In case you're deciding between this and the 8.1 MP DSC-W150 -- my friend owns a DSC-W150 and I can see that this camera produces significantly better quality pictures.A quick word on memory cards - You can actually use a regular microSD card with this camera if you use a microSD card to MS Pro Duo Adapter (such as this one). It's worked very well for me.---As far as compact cameras are concerned, the Sony Cybershot DSC-W170 is about as good as it gets.

I loved the image and build quality of the W5 but, I wanted a smaller/lighter camera. The DSC-W170 also offered twice the megapixels, a wide angle lens, 5x zoom lens, bigger/better LCD and a rechargeable Li-Ion battery. The DSC-W170 is very well built, unlike some of the cheaper plastic cameras on the market. For example, Sony used a metal tripod mount instead of a plastic one. Sony used a high quality Carl Zeiss lens on this camera, much like other models in the Cyber-Shot series. However, it's a wide angle lens, so you can fit more people in a shot without backing up. On the back, you will find a beautiful 2.7\" LCD, displaying an impressive 230k pixels. Features are where the W170 really shines. It features Sony's \"Super SreadyShot\" optical image stabilization, which really helps reduce unwanted camera shake. The face detection works very well, as does the smile shutter. A new Sony feature this year is child and adult priority, which amazingly works. \"Happy Faces\" is an in-camera editing feature that can make a person look like they are smiling, which works to an extent. Battery life is rated at ~400 shots, which is accurate and plenty long enough for most people. Noise is not usually a problem if you don't go above ISO 800. It also has an \"Easy\" mode that takes away the more advanced/confusing functions. Some of the other reviewers mentioned poor image quality, which is not true. I wouldn't expect a compact point & shoot to get better results than a chunky DSLR. Image quality is excellent and most users will be very happy with the images this camera can take.

Cech", "ReviewID": "R3RVQC9NJP7GFJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera over a month ago and have taken a couple hundred pictures with it so far.  The picture quality is incredible for such a small \"pocket\" camera.  The camera itself appears to be well made.  The battery/card compartment is nicely laid out.  The door to this compartment looks/feels like it is a little cheap.  Although I haven't had a problem with mine what-so-ever, I believe if you weren't paying attention while opening or closing this door, you could force it easily enough and possibly break/damage it.  This is the only possible problem I can see having with the camera other than dropping it.I really like the big disply in the back and the \"stable\" feature.  It REALLY cuts down or just about eliminates blurry pictures.  The camera I had before this was the Sony Cybershot DSCS730 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom.  That camera was ok, but I had blurry pictures it seemed 1/2 the time.I really like and use the Red Eye fix feature in the camera which takes the Red eye out after taking the picture and while reviewing your pictures.  The \"smile\" feature the camera has really works and is quite incredible.  I've used it with family or group photo's.  The camera wont take a picture until one person which you can select actually smiles.  Very cool....I didn't think this feature would actually work, however it does, and does well.Another nice feature I like and use frequently is the ability to plug the camera in to the TV and watch the photo's.  It comes across on the TV like a computer screen saver.  The photo's come and go and there's even music if you want it.  Or you can just manually scan through the pictures on the camera and watch them with the family on the TV instead of all huddleing around the computer monitor.Finally, if you have big fingers, I think this camera could be a little difficult to operate.  Some of the buttons and the dial in the back could be hard to operate.Unless something mechanical happens to this camera, I think I've finally found the right \"point and shoot\" camera for me.", "Date": "October 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "A great little camera", "Author": "Kaleidocherry", "ReviewID": "R1EXUE1NAAP4S2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I spent a great deal of time on Steve's Digicams website reading reviews and looking at sample pictures.  Primarily I use my camera for blogging and not for prints, so the way the pictures look on the web is what I used for a guideline.  Specs-wise I had actually one-click-ordered the new Nikon Coolpix S610 from Amazon before panicking (because there were no reviews or sample pics for that anywhere yet) and cancelling the order.  It was then down to this model.  I went to a local electronics store and checked it out (as well as looking at the competition in case there was something I missed) and ended up taking this nice red one home.The only two things I see \"wrong\" with this camera are that you need to use the Memory Stick (so I had to buy one, whereas we have 3-4 SD cards already) and that you can't operate it with one hand.  My old 2.3 megapixel Canon was set up in such a way that you could hold and shoot with your right hand (assuming your hand was steady enough).

Otherwise my experience has been mixed - some of the pictures are great, while others are blurry, despite the fact that this camera features 'anti-shake' technology.The other good feature is the size - not too small, so you can hold it correctly in order to stabilize the shots, and enough heft to feel confident in your focusing on the object.Finally it has 10 megapixels and a 5X zoom lens, which is also by Carl Zeiss, so you know you are getting a quality lens.All in all I can recommend this - just don't expect it to equal the quality of more up to date cameras.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "excellent camera", "Author": "Cornelia M.

I've had these issues for years across various different products: 2 stereos, 1 DVD player and 2 digital cameras ... the last one which was the DSC-W170. The camera's features are great ... intuitive and easy to use. Don't feel like I miss anything that I would like to have. The quality of the photos is also great, having been regularly complimented for my pics and often drawing a \"shock\" surprise when they find out I took the pics with a small pocket digital camera! But what is a HUGE issue to me, has been the unreliable quality of the camera. As with all my other before-mentioned Sony products, the camera started having glitches after only 6 months. In the case of this camera, the issue I have is that the \"settings\" start to change automatically and in total random order when I turn on the camera! It is as if I were moving the setting dial repeatedly and in all directions. The camera just does this on its own. Sometimes it doesn't do it and works fine ... in other occasions it does so continuously and in other occasions sporadically. It would seem that it's got a mind of its own. Trouble is, I have to \"wait\" until the camera stops fooling around ... and sometimes miss a great pic opportunity altogether. The previous camera (another model) had similar issues, only that it would show its temper by simply shutting off and refusing to turn on.Bottom line: I recommend you do NOT buy this camera (or any other Sony product). It is great, but it will let you down after a few months. In my case, I will buy a Lumix which a friend of mine has had for some years and has worked reliably and with just as good quality.

If you're looking for a decent digital camera that is user-friendly, takes quality pictures, has a view finder, good battery life, and not too bad of a zoom (5x) than look no further, seriously. The pictures come out great, it's really easy to figure out (even before skimming through the user manual) and the LCD screen is the perfect size. I have no complaints except that it lags for about 3 or 4 seconds before it pulls the lens back into the camera to turn off. But seriously people, 3 or 4 seconds? isn't it crazy how people find a problem with waiting 3 seconds!?! NOT that big of a deal unless you are the most impatient, anal person around. Plus I don't remember it doing that when I first got it, so maybe I mishandled it or kept turning it on and off too many times. Either way, it doesn't interfere with my enjoying the camera regardless.Overall, it's a perfect point-and-shoot for the price and its features, plus I like the design, it has a sleek look and nice shape. Great for vacations and taking random pictures of friends and family and I forgot to mention, the color and lightning is just fantastic.

One thing I do miss on the W170 that I had on the T100 is the sports shooting. I used it a lot shooting pics of football games. Can't understand why they didn't include this on the W170. That's the one reason I gave it four stars.Additional info after having camerca for a few weeks: So, I've had this camera for about a month now and had a chance to take pics during the Christmas and New Year's holidays.

Most of the pictures we took look good on the LCD screen however when we uploaded them to the computer, we noticed that only about 20% actually looked okay. The camera did well in bright lightning although even then it had a hard time focusing on even slow moving objects. However, in indoor shots even using the flash, the images would be grainy, details would be lost. The camera would have a hard time focusing. Tried the different settings on the camera without any improvement.When we then tested it against the five year old DSC-V1, the old camera with 1/2 the megapixel produced sharper pictures under the same conditions.So buyer beware.

In fact, it is the best of the four cameras that I have tried in low light situations without flash.  However, it has one flaw which caused me to return it in favor of a canon a2000, which is, while the lens is extended, the camera makes a continuous grinding noise, like a cheap plastic wheel spinning.  It is not loud and you have to put your head to the camera to hear it.  Big deal, right?  Here's the thing.  When you record video, the microphone picks this sound up.  Anything recorded indoors (or any situations without much background noise) will render a recording with this grinding noise in the background.  I don't want that in my family videos.  I thought it was a defective camera, so I exchanged it.  The second camera did the same thing.  I talked to sony support.  At first, they tried to deny it, then finally called it a \"normal function\" of the camera.  So, I returned it and bought a Canon A2000, which is bulkier, but has the same amount of mp and has a 6X optical zoom.  One more note, what's with the price fluxuation?  I bought it here (from Amazon, but other sellers were competitive) for $179.00 a month ago, and now the price is over a hundred dollars more???", "Date": "February 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "I got a lemon.", "Author": "J.
