An avid fan of digital since it's inception I had moved up from basic cameras to a nice entry level Nikon DSLR in 2011. Feeling I needed something a little more serious I began researching the 'prosumer' class cameras including top end APS-C camers from several quality manufacturers. A little reluctant to move from Nikon I warily looked at specs of other higher APS-C sensor cameras. Not feeling I could justify the cost of a full frame DSLR but wanting a higher level of preformance I found the specs of this camera to be as appealing as it's price point, Went ahead and ordered the two lens kit with the 55-300mm lens and am totally satisfied!The camera has a really nice feel to it. I don't have huge hands but average, and it feels really good and secure in one hand. The weight is good, a nice solid feel and well balanced even with the 55-300mm lens attached. I was pleased to see that with the 18-55 lens, though somewhat heavier than my Nikon D3100, this camera is more compact (shorter) since the VR is built into the camera and not the lens, allowing a more compact lens.The auto focus is quick and accurate, the continuous focus being amazing! The hi burst shooting mode (about 6 fps) is amazing too. It shoots so fast you cant even count the exposures but the images are fabulous.Great resolution, amazingly fast and clear up to 3200 ISO speed, shooting into the night. This camera has quickly become my best friend! You will not be disappointed!", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great sensor; lenses excellent for the price", "Author": "Stephen", "ReviewID": "R3F2VRPO3PA8F5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For a kit lens, the 55-300 mm lens is sharp and has beautiful bokeh.

Rupp \"Golf Anyone?\"", "ReviewID": "RGIP700ITEIOI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This really should be a great camera and I love most aspects of it however the autofocus really is poor. I had a bridge camera prior to this with a zoom range far greater than my 50-300mm gives me and I got tack sharp photos most of the time. The K30 just cannot match that...perhaps it is \"user error\" (every old-timer in the Pentax forum will denigrate any newcomer to the forum who suggests that the autofocus is sub-par). However I can put the camera on a tripod, use an RF shutter release and the results are variable, some shots are great, some not so great, and others downright bad using autofocus. I wish I could say better of this camera because I love the features and the usability but the bottom line is performance and that is just average in my opinion.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lovely step up from a nice point and shoot.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RSHT8IQIXE88B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say, I'm quite pleased with this camera.  I used to have a Canon PowerShot SX30 IS, and while that was a very nice camera for a beginner, now that I'm getting more into photography this K-30 is quite pleasing.  I decided to go Pentax due to their reputation for building sturdy cameras (I have a 2 year old daughter who WILL get her hands on it from time to time).  I also got a trial of Adobe Lightroom 5 to really learn the developing process.  I leave the white balance on auto and shoot RAW, the camera seems to pick a very close white balance by itself but it's certainly easy to edit later.  The dynamic range seems quite decent, I've shot a few sunrise pictures and I was really able to bring out the details in the shadows.My camera came with the 18-55 DA L and the 55-300 DA L.  They seem fine, supposedly they are pretty decent for kit lenses.  I don't think they are 'tack sharp,' not that I know precisely what to look for, but they do seem to be able to capture fairly sharp images.  They are not weather resistant, but the body is.  I will have to get a weather-resistant lens later for light rain type stuff.Looking through the viewfinder I saw a speck of dirt or something.  It did not come out in the images, so later I figured out that it was on the 'focusing screen,' and I was able to clean it off with a cleaning kit.  Otherwise great camera out of the box.  I rarely have to use the flash inside.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Newbie to DSLR", "Author": "Gin52", "ReviewID": "R2RUTV6C6FZMFA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I chose this camera because of the good reviews. I did not want to spend hundreds more when I am just starting to learn the basics.Camera takes fabulous pictures, settings were easy to learn, and I couldn't be happier with the photos I have taken so far. The only negative is the auto focus being slow at times, but I knew that when I bought it. Most of the time not a deal breaker but other times it is frustrating when it takes so long to focus and still does not focus on exactly what you want.I wanted to take pictures of the diverse numbers of birds that visit my back yard and the 55-300 lens does a great job!With this camera and lenses I have a great start on my new hobby!Was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the camera kit arrived! When I ordered I was given an estimated delivery date of 2 months but I had all the items I ordered within 10 days!

My first was their basic manual camera and as the years progressed, I stayed with Pentax.  Why?  Because I collected accessories that were Pentax.  I moved up to an autofocus camera when I was diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic.  A high blood glucose number interfered with my focusing the manual camera.  I then moved up to a digital Pentax after several years of lugging tons of film on trips.I finally decided I wanted more megapixels and lenses with newer optics.  Was it habit?  I don't know but I do know I like the K-30.  I like the ergonomic rignt hand grip.  I have a firm hold on the camera and the shape of the grip makes the camera feel lighter.  I love botany and had been frustrated at the movement of flowers in even the slightest breeze.  This camera shoots a perfect picture even in the breeze.  Close-ups are wonderful.After two months, I know I have only scratched the surface of what this camera can do.
