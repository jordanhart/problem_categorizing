I used it for inspecting travel trailer air-conditioner ducting for mice sign; and I found their entrance. The one thing to be aware of is the image is upside down when mounted on the \"gun\" and if you turn the gun the image stays upside down as the camera rotates. But, the monitor is also wireless and easily detachable, so just turn it around.  The image is auto focus and very sharp and clear; HD it seems. The flexible camera snake is stiff, which is good for running it into walls or ducts, but is also flexible and can go around corners with some help; one can bend the tip to the side to inspect an area, or use the included tip-mounted mirror.  The mirror works but the image is not a clear as without the mirror.  The device also comes with a magnet, and a wire retreiver for pulling wires.  I recommend getting the extension and the nice case has a space for it. The camera is only in the tip, so the snake and extension are keyed and wired to fit together; it is not fiber-optic. It is very handy and anyone can use it. I highly recommend it for inspection of any hidden problem.", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "extension for borescope", "Author": "George H.
