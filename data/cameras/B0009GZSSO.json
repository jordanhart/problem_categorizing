{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This camera delivers the goods.", "Author": "Jim Krupnik \"jkrupnik\"", "ReviewID": "RYE90R0EPL96G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a tough review to write, as it could take far more space than alotted. Here is the short version...Some brands of digicams sport German or other Euro lenses. Some will no doubt argue, but after 35 years of being an active photographer, and a tech type of person, I feel that nobody makes high end lenses better than Canon makes them, and nobody makes more lenses that qualify as high end than Canon either.The lens mounted on the S2 IS is the best of it's class. Even compared to quality SLR zoom lenses, it is a premium product. The camera is not a pocket cam, and does not pretend to replace one. Then again, it can do what no pocket cam can ever dream of, and can compete heads up with most digital SLR's in the hands of most people who buy a digital SLR. Truth is, most people who spend the bucks on a digital SLR would get far more from the purchase of an S2 IS.The 5mp sensor produces 8x10 prints that rival 35mm quality. The VGA movie mode is simply awesome, and the DIGIC II chip is the same one that powers top of the line SLR's, which means outstanding speed from startup to shutdown. The selection of modes on this camera is incredible, yet it is easy to make a quick shot that looks great no matter what the situation. The continuous shot speed of 2.4 FPS is plenty when you consider that it isn't a burst mode. If you have a 1 gig memory card plugged in, it will shoot at the top speed until the card is full (around 600 pics at max resolution). The intervalometer function is a real treat, as you can shoot time lapse pics with a press of a button, and you have full control of how often the shutter trips, and for how long.A 1 gig memory card will give you just over eight minutes of VGA movie time with high quality stereo sound. For most functions that don't call for a DV tape camera, 8 minutes of high quality TV screen sized full motion video is a long time. Consider that an old \"super eight\" film camera was only good for 3 minutes per reel, had no stereo sound, and wasn't as smooth as the S2's 30 FPS speed. Then there is the IS function. Between reviews and first hand experience, nobody makes an image stabilizing system as good as Canon makes it. It works in spectacular fashion for both still pics, and movies.OK, other reviwers will compare specs, and show that the S2 IS is the top dog in the most useful class of cameras to hit the market in a long time. I just want to make sure that people thinking about buying a digital SLR look at the S2 first.  I bought the S2, the lens hood, and lens adaptor, a closeup lens for use at max telephoto, a wide angle lens, a telephoto extender lens, a set of Hoyo UV and Polorizing filters, and a fine quality camera bag for under $1,000. My next purchase will be a slave flash to extend the flash range of the camera. The model offered by Canon is pretty cheap, and there are others to consider.The bottom line is that the S2 is larger than a pocket cam, but much smaller and lighter than an SLR, and can beat the average SLR package to near death right out of the box for most shooting situations. Equip the S2 with a handful of accessories, and the casual SLR owner will have to spend thousands of Dollars on lenses, accessories, and a reasonable video camera just to keep up.The S2 is a major compromise if you make a living taking pictures, and choose to spend thousands in order to make sure that you can handle every situation that pops up, but the S2 and a full compliment of accesories will fit in a medium small camera bag, weigh very little, and capture 95% of your shots just as well for under a grand. And it does awesome image stabilized still pics and movies.I suspect that more than half of the people who buy digital SLR's would have been far better off with an S2, and would be enjoying new features well into the first Months of ownership. If you have the itch to step up, and you are torn between an SLR and a S2, buy the S2. You will be thrilled with what the UPS guy delivers. Buy the SLR in two or three more years. They might break out of the mold, and be ready for prime time in the consumer market by then.Last note. I took my first pic with the S2 set to auto, flash on, at 12x zoom. I was sitting on my couch 18 feet away from my kitchen in dim evening light, with one incandescent light burning near my couch. I focused on a box of Cheerios sitting on top of my refrigerator (unlike many earlier digicams, the S2 locked on in a flash), and snapped the pic. The box was in a 3/4 view, so I could see the side panel, and the front face. Reviewing the pic on the camera, I was able to clearly read even the finest print on the side panel of that box. Take a look at the print on the side of a standard sized box of Cheerios next time you are in the market, and imagine snapping a handheld shot from 18 feet away, and reading every word in sharp detail on the camera display afterwards. Canon knows how to make a proper lens. And yes, Canon does Linux. I have been Windoze free for several years now, but free open source apps work fine with this camera, and I heard a rumor (I will try it soon on my Xandros box) that the Canon Win apps run under Crossover Office for Linux. Meanwhile, the camera app included in SuSE 9.3 communicates with the S2 as a PTP device with no problems.Update - 7.10.05.I have now used the camera for a little longer time, and had the chance to compare it more closely to it's Panasonic and Sony competitors. The S2 holds up like a champ. It has (by far) the best movie functionality among the three, and allows full and quiet use of the zoom capability of the camera while shooting movie clips. The stereo sound has amazing quality, and the built in wind screen function for the microphones work like a charm. The image stabilizer also does a fine job of eliminating vertical jitter when shooting a movie, yet does not interfere with zooming and panning at all. The zoom rate in movie mode makes for smooth operation, without a hint of lens motor noise spoiling the finished movie. Auto focus, and auto exposure during movie shooting are nothing less than spectacular. The S2 is simply the best TV quality movie taking still camera on the market. Period.Memory cards.. I now have two SanDisk Extreme III 1 gig SD cards.  They are flawless, and can shoot almost 600 full size pictures at a clip in 2.4 fps high speed continuous mode without a glitch. A good set of rechargeable batteries are able to keep up as well. None of the othe other cameras in this class can match it. I read from one reviewer that the Lexar 32x cards, and the SanDisk Extreme II cards work just as well. If so, it can save you about $20 per card. The more cards you have, the more movie time you can record.On the primary still image side, I have concluded that it is a tight battle between the top brands, but Canon still retains it's  title as the manufacturer of the overall best premium lenses. That's not a slap directed at the other two, as they all represent incredible optical quality. One area where the S2 is a clear winner is in function controls. Once you get used to the button layout, it is possible to execute very quick shooting decisions by pressing the right button, rather than roaming through nested menus. The other area is the Image Stabilizer. The Canon Image Stabilizer beats the offering from the other two hands down in both functionality, and user control. It is so good, you can take a handheld pic at 1/60 to 1/30 of a second at max zoom (nearly 500 mm compared to a 35 mm SLR), and clearly read the license plate of a subject vehicle located several hundred yards away from the camera.Try that with a handeld SLR that does not have an image stabilized lens that alone costs more than the entire S2 package... The above issues are among the most important in the real world, and Canon delivers. Speed of startup, focusing, continuous shooting, and shutdown are close between the top three cameras, and Canon  is not the fastest in all areas, but it has the best balance across the board. The final result will not only impress those who view your work, it will also impress you. Again, the ultimate margin from one to the next is small, but Canon offers the most complete package.To sum up the update, the S2 has a very fast learning curve, outstanding accessory lenses, and overall best in class quality.  I bounced mine off the asphalt from about three feet today with no ill effects. I wouldn't suggest you try it, but it survived just fine. The only scratch was to the ring of the Hoya UV filter I had attached to the lens (Thank God). If you are looking for the top camera in the new top consumer camera class, the S2 is it. Buy it and be real happy about how you spent your money.", "Date": "July 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "Best word to describe it is \"WOW!'", "Author": "Matthew W. Bovee \"weeblackdoggie\"", "ReviewID": "R34KKXDML2Z4VZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[Follow-up to the follow-up below] - I've had this camera for a long time now, and it still delights, still generates envious compliments from people viewing the photos or sporting competitor's cameras. Have used it to capture long-range zooms of our backyard denizens (marmots, rabbits, cardinals, skunks...), super macro close ups of flowers and insects, long range action stop-action shots of the kids in sports, rainbows in the mist at Niagra [hard to get in focus, but this will do it w/a little quick trial and error], and even high detail shots of aircraft at airshows. I handed it to my 16 year old son to try out, and challenged him to get a closeup of a helicopter in flight, and in 3 tries and about 2 minutes he had it figured out. Takes a bit of skill to be able to pan and get a good shot of a fighter jet firing afterburners as they cut past, but I've done it. And, the image stabilization is so good, you can even see the detailed thrust patterns in the jet flame. You can get a 2 GB high speed SD card cheap, and the camera is now inexpensive as well as easy to learn. It's possible, but difficult, to beat the combination of optical lens size and quality, 12x optical and 4x digital zoom, intuitive ease of use, at such a low price. A keeper![Follow-up to the review below, after over 18 months of use]: Still delighted with this gem. Used a 1GB SandDisk Ultra II SD card for about a year, and when prices dropped I bought a 2GB off brand card to enable taking more videos too, before running out of space prior to downloading. Not too many complaints: it's battery-thirsty as noted below. Solved that with two sets of rechargables and a cheap recharger for about $20 total. When shooting video it has an annoying flashing light at the front that can distract the subject, so you have to cover it with a finger while holding it. But, the pictures and detail are amazing, the zoom/macro/supermacro features are top notch and invaluable. It still blows away many newer cameras with more pixels per image, but poorer/smaller optics and reliance on digital zoom to make up for gathering more light via the lens and zooming in BEFORE digital \"zoom\" cropping. Was on vacation last week and used someone else's new digital competitor to take their picture, and it was good, but not as good. The newer camera didn't fit well in my hands, took a picture that didn't color match well with true colors photographed, and had a klutzy-microbutton-interface. Thought I paid a LOT for the Canon when it first came out, but was happy with all the features. Now, almost two years later I'm even happier I made the purchase. It still blows away the competition!]==============[original review follows]============================I'm not a deeply experienced digital camera buff. But, I'm fairly tech literate, have a very critical eye for color, detail, and composition for photos and painting, and I did my homework on this purchase. Tried out Kodak, Nikon, and Konica cameras with similar MP and zoom specs and features, and the Canon Powershot S1. Didn't even KNOW the store had this Canon S2 model in yet, and stumbled across it. The better quality in its clarity, color and sharpness images was IMMEDIATELY apparent. So, too, was the ease with which I could quickly navigate the settings (as a complete novice) and find what would get me a dynamite shot. I've had it less than 24 hours and have tested out its Macro, Super Macro, optical zoom, optical + digital zoom, autofocus, and a few other settings. With Macro and Super Macro I'm already getting professional quality images with detail, exact color, and clarity that would blow you away. Other settings are good, but my skill in applying them is lacking so the compositions are not stellar.Other competing cameras did not come close to matching the color reproduction of the Canon, nor did they match the image clarity, ease of handling, set up of menus... Most were not a patch on this camera. In fact, with the exception of the Nikon and Konica Minolta Z5, the Canon Powershot S1 beat most of the 5 MP cameras for color and clarity, too. So, if money is an issue you might consider whether you would be happy with 8\"x10\" as a maximum enlargement and go with the 3.2 MP Canon instead. But, if you want 5MP detail, high-speed 48x zoom with image stabilization, color and clarity that will blow you away, plus features and form organized to make it a breeze to use...get the Powershot S2.It's expensive, but WORTH EVERY PENNY. While you've got your pocketbook open, plan on getting over to Wally World and buying a good 1hr recharger and two sets of 4 NIMH batteries for this puppy, plus at least one 1GB high-speed SD card (San Disk Ultra II or Lexar 32x). You should be able to cram in about 800 full-size, full detail 1.2 MB photos on a single SD card that way. If you can get a better deal on 512 MB SD cards and wonder if you should get several of those instead of one whopping big 1GB card, go for it. Swapping the card out is a breeze. If you plan on needing more, memory is getting cheaper every day. But be sure to get the high speed stuff to save on batteries and keep the options open for fast continuous shooting.I am running a Gateway tablet PC with Windows XP and haven't even installed the Canon photo shop type software for image manipulation. But, with XP it's plug-and-play to download images. I hooked up the USB cable and in a snap my test photos were downloaded to a folder under MyPictures. No muss, no fuss, no setup, not learning new software...a breeze.Bought this camera to satisfy my desire to get telephoto shots and macro close ups for artsy photog hobbying, selling stuff online, bird- and animal-watching. Also got it to satisfy my wife's need for a portrait camera that would allow fast shooting without a lot of composition set-up, yet have enough megapixel detail to allow it to be cropped later and still blow up if need be. This bad boy has it all, and then some. I am delighted with it and haven't even begun to tap its potential.", "Date": "June 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very good camera, still room for improvement", "Author": "Jerry the Rare", "ReviewID": "R1ZLUFK51EKLVW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Canon PowerShot S2 IS about a year ago, and have taken about 2,500 photos and about 15 video clips with it. Overall, I am very happy with it, and if I were buying a new camera today, I probably would get the S2 or S3.Things I like about the S2:  * Extended zoom (12x). I use it often.  * Image stabilization. Particularly helpful when using a high zoom factor, or when shooting in low light with a low ISO setting. It makes handheld shots at slow shutter speeds possible.  * Electronic viewfinder means \"what you see is what you get\", just like an SLR. While not as sharp as an optical viewfinder, the ability to frame the picture without worrying about parallax more than makes up for it. In fact, one advantage over an SLR is that there is no mirror for it to move out of the way, therefore there is no mirror noise when taking a picture; if you turn off the electronic sound effects, it is very quiet indeed (although not completely silent).  * The screen moves and rotates. I like that it can be closed (turned in toward the camera) and thus protected from scratches. I have used it folded out and rotated forward in order to see myself in a self-timer photo. I have used it to take \"clandestine\" pictures--holding the camera down near my waist, I can still see the screen if I rotate it towards me. I have also used it to take pictures while holding the camera above my head--above a crowd, for instance, or over a wall.  * Multiple-picture mode. Similar to a motor drive in film cameras, this allows me to take several pictures in quick succession by holding down the shutter release button--about 2 pictures per second. And unlike some cameras, the only limit to the number of pictures is the amount of available memory.  * It can be used in all-automatic mode, all-manual mode, or just about any combination in between. Even in near-automatic mode, several exposure settings can be adjusted.  * Very good movie mode. It will shoot a VGA-quality picture (640x480) at 30fps. While the results are not as good as my 3-CCD DV video camera, I am much more likely to have this camera with me than the video camera, and I really like the option of taking a reasonably high quality video. I have used it several times.  * Stereo microphones. Decent sound for video. Can also be used for adding a sound memo to a still picture (e.g. \"this is at such-and-such a place, blah blah blah\"), or just for recording sounds unrelated to any picture. I have used this a couple of times to record a \"sound memory\" of a place; one was at a botanical garden at a spot where the scenery wasn't especially pretty, but the sounds the frogs made were like nothing we had heard before!  * Separate buttons for still pictures and movies. Easy to remember which is which.  * Manual pop-up flash. Some people don't like that the flash doesn't pop up automatically when needed. I actually like this feature, because often I want to shoot without a flash when the camera thinks I need to use the flash. And of course I can force the flash to fire even in bright daylight when the camera thinks it is not necessary--although for a while I kept forgetting how to turn on that feature on, even though it's pretty obvious (there's a button right next to the flash!).Things I don't like about it:  * Poor low-light performance. More precisely, poor performance at high ISO settings. The camera will do fine in low light if you leave the shutter open long enough, or use a flash. But if you kick up the ISO to 200 or 400 (equivalent to a \"fast\" film) so that you can take indoor shots without a flash, you end up with very noticeable graininess in the pictures. This is my number one disappointment with the camera. However, I don't know of a comparable camera that does better (and from the sample pictures I have seen, the S3 isn't any better; I don't know why they bothered to add an ISO 800 setting--it seems completely useless to me). I know there are cameras that do, but they cost a lot more. I saw pictures taken indoors with a Canon 20D SLR that were phenomenal. But besides the added expense, a camera like that is also bigger and heavier, and therefore less convenient.  * The camera is too big for a pocket. I would love to have a camera as capable as this that would fit in my shirt pocket, or at least my coat pocket or a smallish holster. I would take it more places if it wasn't so big.  * And yet, at the same time, it's a little too small for my hand. The grip just doesn't feel right. The grip on the 20D felt GREAT! However, it's just about right for a woman's hand--my wife likes it fine.  * No filter threads in the standard configuration. A big lens like that is practically begging for fingerprints or scratches. I solved that by adding the conversion lens adapter, which does have filter threads (more about this below).  * Lens cap is held on by friction. This is both a pro and a con. It's good because the lens extends when the camera is turned on; if the lens cap is attached the lens will simply push it off. It's bad because the cap could come off when you don't want it to. This is a moot point with the conversion lens adapter, as the standard lens cap will no longer fit.  * The default exposure is too bright. Not every review mentions this, but apparently it is fairly common for Canon cameras. Fortunately, this is easily fixed by setting the exposure adjustment (I set mine to -2/3 stop). I haven't figured out how to adjust the exposure for movies, though. I need to look in the manual to see if it's possible!If you buy the S2 (or S3), I'd suggest also considering:  * Canon LAH-DC20 Lens Adapter and Hood Set. As I mentioned above, this allows you to add a filter to protect the lens. Currently $37.10 at Amazon.  * A 58mm skylight or UV filter to screw on to the lens adapter.  * A 58mm lens cap to cover the adapter/filter. Canon's 58mm Snap-On Lens Cap is currently $9.99 at Amazon.  * A high-speed SD card, at least 512MB, but 1GB or 2GB would give more space for movies. (I use a SanDisk Ultra II Plus, which has the added benefit of being able to directly plug into a standard USB port without an adapter.)  * Rechargeable NiMH batteries. I don't have any yet, but this is the next thing on my list. I've gone through way too many AA batteries!A nice option available for this camera is the TC-DC58B Tele Converter Lens. This gives you a maximum zoom equivalent to 648mm on a 35mm camera. Amazing! I have not purchased it yet because so far the built-in zoom has been sufficient for my needs. There is also the WC-DC58A Wide Converter Lens for taking extra-wide-angle pictures.After you get the camera, you'll probably want a case of some type for it. There are *lots* of cases to choose from. After trying a few and looking at a lot more, I finally settled on the Tamrac Velocity 4. It may or may not be what you need in a case, but there it is FYI.", "Date": "November 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "fantastic camera & dollar value", "Author": "RockyMtnReader \"RockyMtnReader\"", "ReviewID": "R207476KPVRCID", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for over a year and absolutely love it.  I frequently have 8\" x 10\" and 11\" x 14\" enlargements made and the quality of the prints is fantastic -- tack sharp and wonderful color.  They look as good as the 8 x 10's and 11 x 14's I get from my SLR --  no visible difference! Add to that the fact that the S2 IS lens covers and extremely long zoom range WITH image stabilization and buying this camera becomes a no-brainer!  The \"IS\" feature really works -- I can shoot 3 stops slower than without IS and still get no image blur -- amazing!  This is important if you do a lot of handheld shooting at full telephoto and/or in low light situations.Like to shoot extreme close-ups of flowers, insects, ebay items, etc?  The macro capabilities of this camera are outstanding.  I've never shot much in the way of close-ups with my other cameras because I don't have any macro lenses.  With the S2 IS, I've discovered a whole new area of photography -- the world of macro -- and it's a blast!For those who are techno-phobic, you can shoot this camera in fully automatic mode and consistently get very accurate exposures.  When I do this, I'd say the exposures are accurate at least 90% of the time.  If you want or need more creative control, the S2 IS can be shot in manual mode, aperature-priority, shutter-priority, etc.  You call the shots (no pun intended) -- all the control you could want (or not want) is there for your convenience.Should you buy this camera or the S3 IS?  If you just have to have the S3 IS's black body-color and money is no object, go for it.  If however, you simply want a camera that is just as capable, save yourself some $$$ and buy the cheaper S2 IS.  You won't be disappointed and that extra megapixel of resolution you get with the S3 IS is something you will never see in your prints anyway.  OK, if you want enlargements of 20 x 30 or larger you might notice a slight difference in sharpness, but come on, most people never print anywhere near that large!  If you are happy with your 4 x 6's up to 11 x 14's (or even 16 x 20's): BUY THE CHEAPER AND JUST AS GOOD S2 IS -- it's one heck of a camera and significantly less expensive than the S3 IS.Remember: no camera, no matter how expensive, will make you a better photographer.  Photography is in your eye, your ability to visualize and transfer a dynamic or highly emotional moment onto paper.  The camera is only a tool; a means to an end.  If you want to improve your photography skills, shoot a lot of pics; learn from you mistakes as well as you sucesses and READ as many good books about photography as you can get your hands on.  Don't be afraid to experiment or take risks with your shooting -- you will develop your eye and your own personal style with time and practice.  I've seen plenty of excellent photos shot with inexpensive point & shoot cameras and lots of bad ones shot with $5,000 worth of equipment.  It's YOUR EYE that makes or breaks a photo!  Sure, a more expensive camera may offer some technical advantages in certain situations, but all the technology in the world can't save a lousy composition!Some books worth reading if you are serious about improving your photographic skills:*Creative Nature & Outdoor Photography, by Brenda Tharpe*anything by Ansel Adams (most of his books are available in libraries)*Understanding Exposure, by Bryan Peterson*Designing a Photograph, by Bill Smith*Photographic Compostion, by Grill and Scanlon", "Date": "November 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "A wonderful camera", "Author": "Steve Shimkus", "ReviewID": "R3AVRPYH4ZDLT0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is really wonderful.  I previously had a Sony digital camera, about 5 years old, and this one blows it away.  Of course, that should be expected because this camera is 5 years newer technology.  The improvements I am realizing are:1) 12x optical zoom.  This cannot be understated.  I am really able to take pictures that otherwise I would have been too far away to capture.  The camera's larger size is more than offset by this capability.2) Good flash.  I can light up large rooms with the powerful flash.3) SD card - one of the more common, inexpensize memory cards out there.  I recommend getting a 60X card for maximum speed.4) AA batteries - in case of an emergency, you can always buy a 4 pack and keep on going.  I bought a NI-MH charger with 8 batteries at Uncle Sam's for under $20.  No more proprietary batteries for me!5) 5MP - the picture quality is excellent, better than my old Sony.  Since I don't routinely make posters out of my pictures, this is plenty.6) 640x480 video @ 30 fps with stereo audio.  This thing is a high quality camcorder limited only by the size of the memory stick.7) LCD which can be folded open and seen from front of camera:  My wife and I commonly take pictures where I hold the camera out in front of us and take the picture of us arm in arm.  Now I can make sure things are lined up before pressing the shutter.  It is also nice that the LCD flips over so it can be stored against the body of the camera to prevent scratches.8) Macro photography - this is a whole new area for me, as my old camera could not do this.  I have taken pictures at 3\" and had them come out very clear.9) Through the lens viewfinder - which helps make sure that I am really taking a picture of what I am aiming at.The only thing which I would like to see improved is the response time between pressing the shutter and the picture being taken when using the flash.  The response time is very fast when the flash is off, but it can be upwards of several seconds if the flash is required (in full auto mode).  I have not played with the flash and other settings to see if I can improve on this, and believe that I probably can due to the ability to fully customize this camera.Update (8/11/07): I was carrying the camera in the leg pocket of my cargo shorts and somehow it managed to turn on, and attempted to extend the lens.  Since it was constrained by my pocket, it beeped, alerting me to its failure to extend the lens, and turned off.  The camera will no longer extend / retract the lens and doesn't work any more.  For $130, Canon will repair it.  I got 2 years of service from this, and it might be time for an upgrade.", "Date": "June 29, 2005"}, {"Title": "This is my perfect camera!", "Author": "K.

My camera goes with me everywhere in my purse; I always like to be ready for that once-in-a-lifetime picture, and this camera starts up so fast you won't miss a shot. The clarity, color,and detail of the pictures are excellent. The menu and settings are super easy to use. I love the 12X zoom because I am a nature and wildlife photographer and the image stabilizer makes the camera shake a non-issue. I would highly recommend getting a larger SD card - I got a 512mb, which lets me shoot all day. Battery life is not too bad and I just carry extra AAs in my bag.

All I can say is, where have you been all my life!I wanted a camera that my wife could use as a point & shoot, and something where I would have some control without getting into a digital SLR. This looked like it had the things I was looking for, though I was a bit reluctant going for it because of the 5 mega pixel resolution (I really was hoping to get a camera with 7). Well, this is so sharp, that I can't imagine 7 megapixels. Now for the review:This camera takes awesome photo's no only in the day time, but inside. The flash is very strong and I have not gotten any blurry images (unless I was indoors and did not use the flash). The zoom is truly amazing. The 12x optical is excellent, but I must say I was more impressed with the quality of the digital zoom images that were being produced. The stability control really makes a huge difference I think because I got some pictures I never thought I would get, and they were pretty sharp, too. The basic controls are pretty intuitive, and advanced controls have a small learning curve that anyone with even slight experience with an SLR can master easily (also read the owner's manual). Battery life is very poor, but considering all it does, I don't mind at all. Autofocus is very fast, zoom is very fast, so it will eat up the battery. I am going to buy some rechargeable's, because these lithiums are expensive (though they do last much longer than alkalyne's). The strap that is including is nice, as is the lens cap cover. Cable's are great and transferring the images to my pc was extremely fast. You gotta love the USB 2.0! The LCD is a little tough on the eyes, and for some reason, after looking at it for a couple of minutes, my eyes felt extremely strained. Not a big deal for me, because I prefer the old fashioned way of looking through the viewfinder. Funny thing though, it does not bother me when reviewing photo's. The video is also great, and something that take a bit of learning, but is very cool, is the panoramic function where you can stitch multiple images together. That is very cool (though photo shop will do the same thing, it is nice to have this feature when you are out).I have used this camera in a variety of lighting conditions from beach to dimly lit auditorium and am extremely happy with the way it performs. The fit, finish, and feel are also quite nice, and the camera has several accessories that expand its capabilites. This is probably as close to a digital SLR as you can get, and still be able to have a P&S; that any child could use. I am very happy with this camera! (See my review of the Sony DSC T-1 for a completely different type of review). I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "June 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent compromise between pocket camera and DSLR", "Author": "Bernard Morey", "ReviewID": "R344COHR38PT70", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Background: I've been taking photos for 40 years and did wet photography for many years.  I bought my previous digital camera five years ago but at 2.1 Mp it was past its use-by date.  An upgrade was in order.  After a bit of research - not much - the Canon S2 IS was my choice.  I wanted mega-zoom with image stabilisation, reasonable compactness, and 5+ megapixels.  In the wedding industry, where I have my business,  professional photographers almost universally use Canon digital SLRs so it looked to me that Canon's picture quality and in-camera processing were likely to be superior.I bicycle around Melbourne a lot and a pocket-sized 6-8 Mp camera would be convenient, but that 12x zoom trumps that, even though I have to backpack the camera.  Five megapixels is enough given the sizes I work in - up to A4 - and the zoom means cropping is minimised.Features I like.I won't rehash previous reviewers' comments.  I like the panorama function.  This is much easier to use than that on my old digicam (which required a tripod for alignment) and the Canon PC software does a good job of stitching shots together.  It can do vertical and horizontal pans, or mixtures of the two.  I can retire my 21mm Rokkor now.  The other day I took hand-held multi-shot pans indoors in a sports stadium.  The indicated shutter speed was 1/16 yet the results are good given the difficult conditions.The two-speed zoom is effective and easy to control.  The slow speed makes it easy to frame a shot, and the high speed gets from maximum zoom to wide-angle fast.Shortcomings.I have noticed the problem with focus in low-light even with the focus assist light on.  Sometimes - not always - the camera can't find the focus.  It seems it needs a definite edge to focus on.  Having seen professionals move their cameras slightly to find a focus point I suspect the Canon is no worse than others. I can live with it.A case is not supplied.  Canon is keeping the purchase price down I suppose, but all the same you do need a case.  The official Canon case is ridiculously expense.The lens cap is a slip-on type and is not as secure as one that grips a filter thread, but it's bearable.The small capacity SD card supplied is a cost-cutter and must be augmented immediately.The electronic viewfinder is not as easy to use as an optical viewfinder in daylight, but is better than optical in dim light and displays comprehensive picture information.  The LCD display is small but this is more than offset by the convenience of the swivelling feature.  The latter is great for taking pictures holding the camera over one's head.Lack of a hotshoe flash or sync socket. A strange, and major, omission which dowgrades the camera advanced amateur level to serious amateur level. It will take an expensive Canon-brand (radio sync) flash fitted to an accessory bar but I can't use my high-power zoom flash. This was off-putting but I decided I could live with it as I don't do much photography that requires higher power than than the built-in flash.  And the built in flash is reasonably powerful.It's difficult to give an objective assessment having spent the money - cognitive dissonance and all that - but I certainly don't regret the purchase. I'm getting much pleasure from the camera and its excellent output.", "Date": "December 15, 2005"}, {"Title": "As easy as it gets", "Author": "Charles E. Brown \"Charles E.

I travel a lot and needed a camera that would give me high quality, while not having to carry a lot of extra accessories around. This camera FAR exceeded my expectations.For starters, I was taking pictures literally minutes after taking it out of the box. If you do nothing else but point-and-shoot, it is one very exceptional camera. I still can't believe how easy and intuitive it is to use. I have even been able to shoot in low-light conditions without using the flash. The camera's automatic features do a great job even under difficult conditions.The zoom is powerful. As an example, if you know EPCOT at Walt Disney World in Florida, I was able to stand in front of the American Expeience and get good close-ups of Spaceship Earth. I estimate that the distance was about 3/4 of a mile.You can easily override any of the automatic settings. However, interestingly, there are a number of preset settings you can use for common situations such as Fireworks or Fall Foliage. I tried those two and the results were very satisfactory.There are two accessories you might want to consider. Each photo you take occupies about 2mb of memory. The SD memory card that comes with the camera is 20mb. This means that you run out of memory after 8 - 10 pictures. That is unacceptable. I purchased a 1-gig memory card for $75. It took me under a minute to pop it in and there is now very little danger of running out of memory.Another thing I would purchase is a good battery charger and keep several sets of charged batteries with you. Digital cameras, in general, are known for eating batteries.Hooking the camera into the computer was quick and easy via the USB port. Since I use some high-end digital editing software, I did not use any of the software that comes with the camera. Because I have not used it, I cannot comment on it.The weight of the camera is light and, as a result, I carry it with me everywhere.I love everything about this camera and have absolutely no hesitations recommending it. Canon has done it again!", "Date": "November 28, 2005"}, {"Title": "Replace your camcorder", "Author": "Todd B.", "ReviewID": "R2U84YCT9730ZR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Others have written some very detailed reviews of this camera so I will not duplicate what has already been said.  Suffice it to say that this is a quality camera loaded with features.  I almost bought an S1 last year.  I was intrigued by the VGA movie mode on the S1, but wanted a model with 5MP or better still resolution.  The S2 is the camera I was waiting for.My goal is to replace my current digital camera and camcorder with the S2.  So far I'm very impressed with the movie quality of the S2.  The only drawback is, of course, the enormous size of the video files.  It would have been nice if Canon had used MPEG compression (hopefully in the S3), but I've found a workaround to that problem.  I've purchased two 1GB Transcend 80x SD cards and a 40GB PD7X CompactDrive hard disk portable storage device.  The CompactDrive will download a full 1GB SD card to its internal notebook hard disk in about 3 minutes without using a computer.  It's powered by 4 NiMH batteries and can download somewhere between 17 to 20GB on a single charge.  Since you can shoot 1GB worth of video in 8 minutes, theoretically by swapping cards and downloading I could shoot about 2.5 hrs of nearly continuous video without even having to change batteries on the PD7X.  I haven't actually tested this procedure yet, but I think it's workable.  As soon as my son's soccer games start up in a few weeks I'll be putting it to the test.Another great feature of this camera is the macro and super macro .  You can shoot extreme closeups with the camera lens virtually touching the subject.  I was just messing around with the camera and took a macro picture of a photo taped to my refrigerator.  I was amazed to see that it was sharp and relatively well exposed even with poor lighting.  It got me thinking about the piles of photos I have sitting in boxes waiting to be digitized.  I have a flatbed scanner, but scanning is very tedious.  Why not just take a snapshot of them with the digital camera?  I decided to convert an old 35mm photo enlarger I had in the attic to a makeshift copy stand.  I rigged up a camera mount and grabbed a couple of clip on reading lamps and started playing around.  After some experimenting I found that using macro mode with Tungsten white balance setting produced great copies of my snapshots.  Once I figured out the settings, I whipped through a couple stacks of snapshots in about 10 minutes.  It's still tedious, but much better than scanning with my slow flatbed scanner.With the S2 you can have your cake and eat it too.  It takes great photos and videos and is easy to use yet powerful enough for those of us that like to experiment.Update 8/04/05I finally got to put the camera through its paces.  I took it to a Braves night game last weekend and was able to capture a beautiful shot of Andruw Jones breaking his bat.  The photo is sharp, in focus and you can clearly see both the broken bat flying apart and the hit ball.  I took the shot handheld at iso 200 from my seat about halfway up the lower section (terrace 221 if you're familiar with Turner Field).  I was amazed to be able to zoom all the way up to home plate and see that level of detail!I also went to a museum and got to play around with the indoor modes.  The museum had several large dinosaur displays in a large atrium.  I used the panorama mode to take a series of shots of the dinosaurs.  After I downloaded the photos I used the photostitch software to put the panorama together.  It worked flawlessly and the results look great!I'm also happy to report that the CompactDrive PD7X worked well.  I downloaded several SD cards to it in the field with no problems.I have one comment about the lens cap.  Many people have pointed out that the lens cap comes off too easily.  I noticed that too shortly after I got the camera and considered it annoying.  However, it didn't take long for me to realize that the cap is designed that way for a reason.  Have any of you turned the camera on before removing the lens cap?  Immediately upon turning on the camera, the lens pops out from its stowed position, and if the lens cap is on it simply pops off without straining the motor.  A tight fitting lens cap would probably be hard on the motor if the camera was turned on with the cap in place.

Especially of tiny bugs, butterflies, and flowers in addition to far away things like birds and the moon etc.  However, I'm not a patient person when it comes to learning what all of the buttons do and reading manuals et al and I wasn't educated in photography so AUTO is important to me!For anyone that wants to pull a camera out of the box, snap a picture, and have others say \"WOW! You're good at taking pictures!\" this is the camera for you ;)It's auto mode is amazing in a variety of lighting conditions and on a variety of subjects.  BUT WAIT! There's More!If you'd like to enhance your pics just a bit, but find too many settings and options and weird names/acronyms way too confusing this camera is GREAT!  It's buttons are labeled and pictured in EASY TO UNDERSTAND Words and Pictures.  Their uses and the menu descriptions are CLEAR, easy to find, and just about ANYONE could figure out what they do.  If you'd love to be able to adjust the shutter speed, ISO, Aperture, etc..but are never quite sure exactly what they do or which way they should go...this camera makes it SIMPLE!  \"lighter, darker, cloudy, fair skinned, dark skinned, nighttime\" are an example of the words you will see.  BUT WAIT! There's More!You need a camera your 2 yr old can use... but you also need a camera \"smart photographers\" can use.  If you want to have it totally manual with a ton of settings to choose from (for a consumer grade digi cam) this cam is the way to go!  You can enter total manual mode and go for it.  Or you can enter \"semi manual modes\" where you set \"this and that\" and it adjusts everything else automatically.If you're a one camera family.... I HIGHLY recommend this camera.  Young or old... clued in or CLUELESS this camera can be used to take breathtaking photos from far away to so close it's bumping the lens.The pano stitching is excellent as well by the way.  I snapped 10 pics (just testing out of the box) and hit the stitch button in the included software and it did everything for me.  In seconds I had an amazing panorama image ... snap, click, done!Cons: Yes...there's always cons...but these are mild in my opinion. It comes with cheesy batteries so be sure to pick up some camera grade rechargables before you check out.  It also comes with a very small memory card (considering the size of the images) so you'll want to pick up a larger card as well.  The 16MB will hold about 10 images at their highest settings.  The ON switch takes a tiny bit of getting used to but the off switch is really easy to find.. be careful.  Thankfully, turning it on is FAST so even if you make the mistake...you shouldn't miss the shot.Did I mention the video camera that's in this thing?  No more tiny 320X240...this does a full crisp and clear 640X480 and it does it well!One last note... the stabalizer is amazing too!  My old cam made it difficult to use the full power of zoom without a tripod.  SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE...hard to keep the subject inside the viewfinder.  NO LONGER A PROBLEM WITH THE CANON!

But instead of buying it on the fly, I researched hard for 1 solid month.  I was still considering the Sony H-1 for the big LCD but it had no Carl Zeiss lens.  The Panasonic had a Leica lens, and Canon has always made great lenses for SLR's so I trust them with digital.(I owned the AE1 and the EOS Rebel).  I am really happy with the purchase.I'll just comment a little on what others have written. -The lens cap is not a big deal and the problem is getting blown way out of proportion. - The zoom is fast and accurate.  The programmed and manual controls are easy to use.  Some reviewers who said their pictures are blurry, I think they have themselves to blame. - The ISO control is a great one to have and easy to use if you want to work with light conditions.  My Sony did not have this feature, and it is something to appreaciate.  This can be changed in every mode but the AUTO. - I took over 250 pictures, overplayed the zoom and used the flash for a few days on 1 set of batteries.  (much better than the Sony DSC-V1 i owned) - The video is great and should be a BIG selling item.  I honestly have not tested the memory psace needed for long videos but the clarity and smoothness is great. -  The 12x zoom has great speed sensitivity. To clarify, a hard push moves really fast and a soft touch zooms it at a great slow speed. - some users do not understand you must be patient with the clos up macro.  This one works really well with a little practice. - It would have been great if the 1.8\" LCD was larger but this is fine.  At least, it can be flipped around and closed to protect it when not in use.I see experienced digital SLR users buying this for the quality, zoom capacity and size.  I am by no means a point and shoot camera person, but this one could be used by those that are.  I enjoy manual controls (shutter spped and aperture) when the time is right.

If you know nothing or very little about higher end digital cameras than I hope it helps to read my review. My goal is to help someone that is considering upgrading from a very basic camera to something more advanced. If you are highly experienced in the digital camera world than I would skip to the next review. lolI took a couple of photography classes long before digital cameras became the norm and so I decided to do some heavy research before purchasing a new camera (my last one was stolen).My first digital camera was a Kodak Dx 4530 which provided me with a lot of fun. It was a great camera for novices. I truly believed I would purchase another Kodak due to my good experience with the first one, and I still recommend Kodak, but this camera's features seemed to fit my present needs.I literally searched hours and hours and made many trips to stores to find the perfect camera for myself. I knew I wanted to make photography a hobby for myself and so I wanted a camera that could offer me a few challenges. This camera offers a lot of \"toys\" to play with and a lot of optical zoom. I also appreciated the fact that the camera has optional accessories that I can add later for an even greater challenge. I want the camera to last a while and not have to be replaced if I decide I need more of a challenge. I also did not want to commit to paying a high price for a camera I couldn't work. I would rather spend the extra money for add-ons after I know I love the camera.Consider your needs before you jump into the purchase of a digital. If you are wanting to snap a few shots of junior opening his birthday presents than you should choose a very user-friendly camera at a cheaper price. After you know your needs, search the internet for reviews that real people write about the products. The reviews truly influence my buying habits in most purchases. Once I narrowed my search to 5 cameras I started comparing them against each other. There are many websites that are great for comparisons. Use your search engine.I would think I found a camera I wanted and go to a store to hold it. I did not want a pocket camera. They are to small for me. I shake more when I can't get my whole hand on the camera. Go in and snap a few shots at the store counter. Some stores will print one of the pictures for you.I'm not an expert on lenses but I have not read one bad thing about the lenses Canon uses in it's cameras. They are high quality glass.The biggest influence in choosing this camera was looking at the pictures actual viewers had listed on this site. Wow! The moon shot impressed me more than any other shot although the others were very enjoyable to view. I looked through them all many, many times.I finally purchased the camera last night and read the manual nearly cover to cover. I thought it was pretty easy to understand. I did feel a little overwhelmed at first. This camera does a lot and it will take a lot of practice to learn how to use each feature. Of course, this is were the challenge I wanted comes into the picture. No pun intended. If you don't want to mess with learning a lot settings than buy a point and shoot camera.After taking about 60 snapshots of pretty much nothing I decided to go outside and take a few pictures of the moon for myself. If I couldn't get anywhere near close to repeating the moon shot I would take the camera back to the store. The first few shots were just horrible. I didn't have a tripod and I was shaking from the cold (36 degrees). I came inside and reread the page about using all of the zoom and I set the camera as noted. I went back outside and snapped four more shots while balancing my arms on the back of the pickup. I can't imagine how blurry these shots would have been without the ability of the anti-shake setting.I came inside and downloaded the pictures (which took a few seconds)and sat with my lower jaw hanging down. My moon shot was beautiful. I could see craters and everything. I knew at that moment that I had to compare my shot to the shot on Amazon. I was very, very pleased. I plan to spend more time this evening capturing moon shots at different settings.I also enjoy that the software included with the camera will allow you to see exactly what settings you used to snap the shot. This will allow me to snap away without writing down notes about the settings I am using. I can simply download the picture and check out the notes provided. The camera will also tell you through the viewer which settings were used when you review the picture. The Kodak software was a little more fun to use when editing images.I did like how I could snap picture after picture. My family had a lot of fun looking through the pictures I took of my son. It looked like a flip book due to the fact that the camera experienced very little lag time. The shutter sounded like the cameras used by professional photographers when they are taking picture after picture of models.I played a little with the other features but not enough to truly comment on them. I did not try out the movies or sound. I look forward to practicing switching between movie and picture mode.I purchased the Kodak 1 GB SD card. It is fast. I believe the camera said I could take over 450 shots with the card. Of course, this amount varies with what you do with the camera. I highly recommend getting the bigger card (although quite expensive)if you are going to spend the money on this camera.I am using the batteries that came with the camera but I also purchased a Kodak 1 hour battery charger kit that came with four batteries. It was less than $19 which is about $20 less than the Canon charger and batteries. The batteries are 2100 mAh which are the same as the Canon. I don't know the actual charging time for the Kodak charger but the instructions listed 140 minutes.My printer is about dead so I also have the Canon MP500 on my wishlist. Amazon customers rated it highly. I wanted to purchase these items together on Amazon but the delivery date became longer and longer away. I didn't want my Christmas presents to be delivered at the end of January! I spent more money purchasing the camera and optional items at Wal-Mart (the charger and batteries were actually $9 cheaper at Wal-Mart). I had to pay taxes and the camera was $50 more! (...). I rarely settle on paying more for something (it nearly kills me) but I now have time to practice before all of our important Christmas celebrations. Also, I feel lucky to have gotten this camera because it was sold out at over 10 stores in our city!I plan to come back and add a review within the next couple of months to let everyone know how the camera is holding up.December 29, 2005 - I promised to let everyone know how the camera is holding up for me and here I am.I must say that this experience has been awesome at moments and very frustrating at other times. I wanted a challenge and I am getting it.I have missed a lot of very important shots because I am trying to learn what settings are best for different moments. I ruined over 40 shots of my kid's Christmas program because I had the wrong settings. I needed to set the speed at 400 and use the florescent (sp?) lighting setting. I went back to the store and the salesman went over a few details with me and things improved.I spent some time taking pictures from the front passenger seat while my husband drove 75 mph on the interstate. I had so much fun! I took pictures of cars about a football field length away from us and was able to later zoom in on the license plates. The numbers and letters on each plate were crystal clear! I also took pictures of signs and trees on the side of the road and all of them were so clear that I would never have guessed that I was riding in a vehicle at 75 mph.I have spent many evenings playing with the camera. I will take out the guide, read a little bit, practice some shots, and then print them out. I took a picture of the couch and then was able to zoom in to see each fiber of the fabric. I took a picture of my Mom and then zoomed in on her cheek. You could see lots of little imperfections that she had never noticed until then (She couldn't appreciate the greatness of the shot -- ha ha).I took about 600 shots and only had to recharge my batteries one time (using the Kodak charger and batteries). I think I took close to 500 of the shots on one charge. The camera gave me a low battery warning early on and I never missed a shot due to lack of battery power.I am purchasing a Canon Pixma MP500 all-in-one printer this weekend and I cannot wait to play. Oh, I still am not satisfied with the software. I am going to purchase additional software to use with my camera.", "Date": "December 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, But Went Sony H1 Instead", "Author": "R. Edser", "ReviewID": "RKCPPKDW196PE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What ever you do, go to a camera shop and spend at least 10mins or more playing with a couple of cameras before you buy!For me it came down to the Canon S2 IS or the Sony H1. I read every single review I could find on both cameras and agonised over the specs and sample pictures, pro's and cons for months.  If you look at the specs of both cameras both seem very evenly matched. In the end I decided on the Canon.A few things that convinced me the S2 was the better choice were: the far superior movie mode (great quality and you can zoom while taking video), the swivel screen, the superior burst mode (unlimited, fast fps).That was until my Dad bought one and I borrowed it for a weeks holiday to a game park. I used the camera all day for a week and I got some amazing photos but I got back quite dissapointed in the camera. Deciding that you can only get so much out of reading reviews I went to a camera shop to actually play with my (then 2nd choice) the H1.It took less than a minute for me to decide that this was by far the better camera (for me). Here's why:1) The S2 has a terrible LCD. It's tiny (1.8\") and almost impossible to use outdoors (even in overcast weather, forget even trying in sunlight). I found myself forced to use the EVF 99% of the time and although better, it really isn't sharp enough. The H1 has a 2.5\" LCD which is MUCH brighter and makes the Canon's seem absolutely tiny in comparison. The EVF on the Sony is also a bit crisper and again, brighter. This is the only criticism I have that I can't put down to simple preference. The swiveling screen was cool, and allowed me to take some shots I wouldn't otherwise have been able to take (holding the camera out the sunroof etc) but when you can barely see what's on the screen it doesn't matter much that it swivels too.2) It's a Sony. This won't apply to everyone of course but being used to Sony cameras there were some basic things about the interface on the Canon I just couldn't get used to (e.g. the zoom rocker in front, the switch to change between record and play (kept going the wrong way), the layout of some controls and the information on the screen). If you've used and like Sony's then keep this in mind (the same obviously holds true in reverse).3) The H1 is faster. The reviews had point out that lag times on the Sony were a little faster than the Canon. This is evident after you've used them both and for me speed is essential since I do a lot of wild life photography on our trips (only thing stopping me going dSLR for this reason is the cost). This might not be too important for some people but for me it's essential.So there's not much in it and one thing I used quite often that I will definately miss is the speed of the high speed burst mode on the Canon. The unlimited duration is not so important since I never actually reached the maximum amount the Sony can take but the Sony's burst mode is a fair bit slower. The movie mode I won't miss because I didn't use it. With a 1GB memory card you only get 6mins of video so I was too scared to use up space I would need for photos.The shots I did get were awesome and that zoom really does kick ass but I urge anyone looking at purchasing a digital camera to make sure they take the time to go the the shops and try out each of their options before making the final decision. You really can't know which you'll prefer just from looking at specs and reading reviews!", "Date": "November 30, 2005"}, {"Title": "The best Canon camera - UPDATE: Not so good after all...:(", "Author": "Leo", "ReviewID": "R1Y9KWEKAJ9EQ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had own several digital cameras. From Kodak, Nikon, Olympus, and Canon. I owned Canon S40, S45, S1 IS, G6, and currently S2. First of all, let me tell you. The absolutely best pictures are only made by Canon. And among Canons that I owned S2 IS is absolutely winner. It takes crisp photos at any light conditions. The 12x optical zoom is unbelivable and IS is must have. So far, I shoot about 200 pictures of moving cars, people, animals and NONE of them are blured. Prior to purchasing this camera, I was concern if 1.8\" screen will be enough as I was spoiled by Canon's G6 2.0\" screen and Kodak's V550 2.5\". I can tell you now that with optical viewfinder that is installed of S2, I am not using screen at all while shooting pictures. The lense cap is something that might be better but as much as I got used to G6 identical one, I am not seeing it as a problem. Now comparing G6 to S2, I am in most occurance prefer latest one as DIGIC II processor is absolutely awesome. It is fast and acurate. And one more thing, S2 makes awesome stereo movies with a lenght of almost 20 min (1G), not like my old G6 that is restricting me to 3 min mono sound movies. So unless you need to print large prints (like I do) of 20\"x30\", S2 is the best Canon camera on today's market.UPDATE (01/07/06):About month and a half ago, my Canon S2 started turning itself off for no apparent reason while I was taking a picture. First I though that it could be a short time limit when camera goes in stand by but it wasn't not the case. The set of 1 month old 4 x 2,300 mAh AA batteries (Sanyo, made in Japan) were always fully charged whenever it was happening and screen was not used. I called Canon Service Dept and they asked to ship it to them. Upon receiving camera back, I found that even though it was not shutting itself that often as before, this problem had still existed and at least once a day, I was expiriencing that problem again. Canon customer service said that they did everything that could possibly be done and there is nothig else that they could do.

This is my first Canon product that did not lasted in my hands for more than a year (I used only for two months when it was problem free).

For its required features (IS, AA batt, SD card, 10x+ zoom), the only other consideration were the Panasonics, which are not as available in retail (wanted additional store protection plan - I'm hard on cameras.)1) you can't insert the SD card wrong and ruin the camera, unless you REALLY force it2) the lens cap does not grip the edge tightly, so it does come off easily when you power on the camera (if you forget to take it off).  And if you think it comes off too easily, a touch of tape to the inside rim takes care of that.3) if it's coming out blurry, either the SUBJECT is moving too quickly for the ambient light, or you've got IS turned off.  IS helps compensate for YOUR hand motion.  All CCD digital cameras have *some* trouble in low light; optical zoom does not help this either.4) yes, a slightly plasticky feel - but seems durable enough (and I have a 3-year protection plan so...)5) yes, the macro/super-macro features are not so intuitive as to be used without reading the manual.  And you won't take optimum pictures without reading it anyway.  Ok, so read the full manual (RTFM).6) I get 2 \"working days\" and 400 photos per battery charge with 2300mAH NiMH rechargeables - that's plenty.

What to do??  We bought the Canon S2 IS and I don't think that either one of us will look back.I love the options that let me be in control of the image and my husband loves that he can point and shoot.  Our pictures have come out well and I have made several 8x10s that are clear and have no pixalation, even after some serious zooming in.  The camera fits easily in the hand and access to the controls are logical and easy to use.The drawbacks include the viewfinder image is digital (which means that it uses battery life and the image in the viewfinder is more fuzzy than your picture)and the menu options are scattered, some features you access from one menu some from the other.  Also, you cannot take pictures while reviewing pictures, so I reccomend waiting to review pictures until you are out of the action. Plus, you definatly want to strap the lens cap to the camera because it is not secure and pops off when the camera is turned on.Don't be fooled by the drawback list, this is a well designed camera that takes excellent pictures, the zoom is great, and even when the photo has been unsatisfactory (my fault) the picture itself has been flawless!The price also makes this a great deal, half the price of an SLR and just a little more money than the \"little\" cameras that have lower megapixels and little or no optical zoom.Worth the money, lots of fun, easy to use; I highly reccomend this camera.update feb 20 2006,I no longer feel like this was the compromise camera.  We have a one month old son and have 1000's of pictures of him.  Our camera goes about 400-500 pictures on a set of batteries, so I am not sure what the reviews that talk about short battery life are talking about.  This has been a great purchase and I still highly reccomend this camera.Also to the reviewers that complain about the bulk - This is a feature packed camera that can be operated with one hand, but it is not an \"elph\".  Less bulky than the SLR's and better zoom and controls than the little skinny cameras, I can't imagine a better design that has all the features and weighs so little.We fianlly have used the videofeature, and the sound quality is suprsingly good, the image was good, we were pleasantly suprised with how well this feature worked since it was the last reason we got this particular camera.Also we have since purchased the San disk 5 in 1 reader to transfer the images to our computer and it works great, I highly reccomend that as a neccesary accessoryStill a great camera, we are very happy we bought this one!!", "Date": "December 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "Things I'm pretty sure you have not considered before deciding if buying or not.", "Author": "Romeo E.

It can be solved in a silly easy way: Put the tiny cap cord between the cap and the lens border (laterally), so it will be tight. Voil\u00e0!2) IMAGE STABILIZATION: It's useful NOT ONLY for HIGH ZOOMING! For example: I love to take low light shots with no flash. Obviously, I need a very slow shutter speed. Shots impossible with the Canon S60  I previously owned (no way I can get a non-blurry image at 1/15s) are perfectly sharp even at 1/8s, and using no tripod but my bare hands!3) VARI ANGLE LCD: Yes! For all of you still deciding between this one and the Sony H1: Have you ever tried doing shots at floor level? Ever been in a concert, sports venue, trying to do a shot above the heads of people? Taking shots of yourself? Kitty corner shots? I could go on and on...4) COLORS MODE. I didn't know the S2 has this feature before buying it. And I read tons of reviews! You can take a shot in black and white, but making stand out a color! Also, you can swap or replace colors!. I know you can do that with Photoshop, but it is cool to test it live, so that you can in advance test different shots and angles.5) SIZE & CASE: Yes, it is big. No, it is not AS big as you can imagine. It fits easily in one hand.Case: I own the \"official\" Canon one. YES, you can't put anything else in the case. NO, I am not annoyed for that. I LOVE the fact the case is just the size for the camera, I don't like to carry a big bag with extra batteries, charger, etc. I love attaching the case to my belt and popping the camera in & out from it as taking walks.-- Well, This these are the things that firstly come out from my mind. I suggest buying at ebay a kit with wide angle/telephoto lens, adapter and hood. They are at $95 roughly. That is the nearer you'll be to a PRO equipment at a surprisingly cheap price!Romeo E.

Hence, my review is just for its cons (and how to overcome them), even though the camera is excellent overall.1. This camera has a major problem with its auto-focus feature. There is a good source for you to understand this problem and how to overcome it. Since I can't give you the direct link, you still con find it using google and searching for a term \"Canon S2 focusing issues\".2. The noise of images using ISO 50, 100 and 200 are relatively better than other P&S; camera but at ISO 400, it's bad.3. When recording video and you need to zoom in and out, the sound of the zoom motor is noticeable in quiet environment and will be recorded into your clip. However, if there is some background sounds, it would not be a problem at all.4. If you use alkaline batteries, you can take only about 130 shots before the batteries drain out. But using NiMH batteries, you can take up to 550 shots on one charge.5. The nature length of the lens makes the build-in flash is useless when you want to take some super-macro (new feature) picture where the object is less than an inch from the lens. In this case, you probably need an external flash.6. Using macro focus (not super-macro) will give you some distortion. It's better to use telephoto macro.7. Below F/4, there can be purple fringing (red, blue, purple fringe on edges), specially in bright scenes.For much more in-depth review, you should also take a look at this well-known digital camera review website: DPreview", "Date": "November 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "First let the pictures blow you away and then the camera.", "Author": "OverTheMoon", "ReviewID": "RU4YK2AGI4S0U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon Powershot S2 SI is saying, \"leave the compact cameras to the mobile phone developers, and the SLRs to pros with the cash for it. Look at me. I am what you have always wanted.\" The Canon Powershot S2 SI is the hybrid offspring of what happens when you cross a compact camera with a SLR. It is lighter than most SLRs but a lot heavier than a compact. You might even feel a little bit shocked when you hold a camera like this that looks almost completely plastic. Its first impressions are flimsy, even when you open the viewer door you are thinking, hold on, this is more like a kid's toy than a Canon camera. Canon is probably nodding its head. If you want the quality of high-end SLR technology, and then some more, for a fraction of the cost, you are going to be making some sacrifices. If anyone has made a sacrifice it is Canon who has shaved $400 off their low-end SLRs (Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR) for the Powershot S2 SI but give you most of the features of a $1000+ Canon Digital SLR (Canon EOS series). For this reason you can understand why something like the screen door feels a little on the light side. The plastic however is middle to high grade graphite, but fairly heavy. If you drop this I would suspect that you would probably end up damaging it easily. You really need to watch this camera like it was your baby. What you need to do is to open up the manual, learn to take automatic indoor, outdoor, close-ups and how to do a full optical zoom with stabilization. Set your picture size to 2,592 x 1,944 with highest settings on quality. The green laser shoots out when you semi-press the snap button, the image suddenly becomes ultra-sharp in the viewer, green square goes on, great, click and then quickly hook it up to your PC to see the results. When you finally load up your images you will be feeling daft about yourself, zooming in on tiny details like the tip of the blade of grass and zooming back to the cinematic garden shot you just took. It doesn't get much better than this for the price. If you where to ask what can this camera do, the answer is in downloading and reading the PDF manual which is 187 pages of functions. Automatic, manual and custom settings abound. If you can do it on a pro SLR, you can probably do it here. With a 1GB memory card you can have up to 8 minutes of good quality video (awesome 640 x 480 video at that for the price) and stereo audio or over 300 full size, best quality images. (As a note: the Canon PowerShot S2 IS gave me a Memory Card Error and or Card Locked! Error with a SanDisk SD 1 GB card, even though the card is unlocked. Sometimes you might not even be allowed to format this card in the camera. This may be due to some cards being faulty but it appears that many users are suggesting that the problem has to do also with the card speed and new Canon cameras. The only solution is to take the memory card back and get another brand. I got this card, it gave me the above errors. I got a different 1GB model (a 150X speed one) and it worked on the Canon Powershot S2 IS, no problem). Although 6M is cutting edge for low-end cameras, you will pay a 1/3 more for the S3. This is a fantastic 5M model for the price. The lens is outrageously good (maybe even SLR pro quality).

Be that as it may, I noticed that one of the special scene modes was \"fireworks\", so I took the camera out to our July 4th celebration. The shots I took were fabulous! If you want to try this yourself, just make sure that you track the flare upward and try to shoot a moment before it explodes. This is because the camera is set to a relatively long exposure time and you want to catch the outward movement of the exploding colored particles from the beginning. Hold the camera as still as you can while the shutter is open, but of course the image stabilization feature is very helpful in obtaining sharp images under these conditions (it also renders the recommended use of a tripod unnecessary in my opinion).

I had previously owned a digital camera it was three years old.  Since the technology has advanced rapidly in that length of time a new camera was desirable.After reading a substantial number of reviews, and talking with people that are highly knowledgeable about photography, I was able to narrow down my choices within the budget I wanted to work with.  I have owned through the years, a number of fine film cameras and have been satisfied with the results; however, the allure of digital cameras is hard to resist, the ability to take large numbers of shots and instantly review your efforts is hard to resist.The camera I finally settled on was the Canon Powershot S2 IS it seemed to include most of the features I felt were needed or desirable and was in the dollar limit I had budgeted.I had very little time before our trip to work with the camera however; controls were logical and easily understandable.  My impressions are from an informed amateur standpoint, not a professional, and should be weighted with that in mind.  The Canon had no issues mechanically or electronically all features and controls worked out of the box, quality control is evident.The final configuration of this camera is as follows:1 - Canon Powershot S2 IS1 - Canon LAH-DC20 Lens Adapter and Hood Set for the S2 IS Digital Camera2 - ATP 1GB 60X Secure Digital Memory Cards2 - Hoya 58mm Lens Filters / UV and Polarizer1 - Lowepro Camera Bag - Novo 1 AWThe quality of the pictures was I felt excellent for the dollars spent.  There are SLR cameras on the market such as the Nikon D 70 that likely surpass this camera however, costing twice the price.  It is highly unlikely that the average user such as myself needs or would use all the features on a digital camera costing over a thousand dollars.  For the semi pros out there and professionals they are a different story, and the money they spend would be justified.I have been able to compare pictures with the Canon against cameras costing a great deal more taking similar shots and the quality differences are negligible at best.I agree with many of the expert reviews regarding this camera, it does a great job for the money spent.", "Date": "September 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "Canon S2 vs. 20D vs. SD Series", "Author": "Mark Bozeman \"Amazon Fanboy\"", "ReviewID": "RKBUVB9ZLCGVG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own both the S2 and SD400, and have used the 20D extensively with L-Series glass, so I'll write a review about the differences.  A featured review compared the S2 with the 20D, and having used both, there's absolutely no comparison, the 20D blows it out of the water.  The 20D consistently produces framable \"art work\" with the right lens, however, getting the body plus the right lens will cost you over $2,000.  So if you've used the 20D, don't purchase this as a substitute, you will be very disappointed.  With all settings on auto, your shots with the 20D with L-Series glass will all make your mouth water, the S2 will \"only\" produce a very nice, and crisp shot, those shots that \"wow\" you, are few and far between.  The 20D can also shoot shots instantenously back-to-back-to-back, and focuses nearly instantaneously, whereas with the S2 there will be a noticeable lag between shutter depression and the shot being taken, even in burst mode, so this camera is definitely not the best for sports or fast action photography, but then again, no digital is shy of the semi-pro DSLRs.A much closer comparable to this model is the SD400, which I also own.  Both produce great shots with great color, with the S2 having the slight edge in terms of clarity, detail, and moderately less CA.  So if they're so similar why would you pay more for a much larger camera?  Well obviously the zoom is huge, especially for wild life photography.  The manual features are very rich, and the camera hunts slightly less, and is noticeably faster (in terms of shutter depression to taking the shot, and in terms of continuous shooting recovery time) than its smaller counter parts.My recommendation:  unless you need the zoom, or will use manual shutter speed / aperture frequently, you'd probably be better of buying an SD camera, as your shots will be of comparable quality, and you'll probably end up using it much more as the SD series cameras are pocketable, whereas this thing is pretty huge.  And you'll end up saving some cash in the process.  I bought this camera for wildlife photography, but for everyday use when I'm with friends or going on day trips, I'll most likely still use my SD400, and not worry about sacrificing much on picture quality.In its class, the S2 is the best camera, hands down, Canon currently makes the best \"point-and-click\" lenses, period.  On the DSLR front, it's a bit more competitive.  I've had a chance to use a few other point-and-clicks, and none have been in the ballpark.

Initially I was leaning towards the Sony H1, but I finally decided on the Canon after several sales reps from different retailers categorically stated that the Canon was definitely superior, primarily because of a superior lens and therefore superior picture quality.  As one rep said, \"If you're looking for the highest quality TV, you buy Sony.  But if you're looking for the highest quality camera, you buy Canon\".The camera handles beautifully and operates very quickly.  Startup and focus times, as well as successive-picture and shutter lags are almost nil.  This is probably because of the DIGIC II processor, which no other camera in this category even comes close to.  Because I do not like bulky cameras, I bought a case that fits the camera like a glove, and is not one of those \"backpack-like\" cases.  The S21S is the smaller sized camera among those in the same category.This is my first digital camera.  I had refused to buy a digital camera in the past (vs. 35 mm) because of the lower quality of prints in older digital cameras.  I was amazed the degree to which the printed photos of the S2IS have crisp, natural and bright colors.  No fading colors or irregular borders.  No visible differences vs. 35 mm. prints, with the exception of minimal chromatic aberration (purple fringing), but only in very high contrast settings.  I have not had the need to retouch a single picture.  The prints will come out identical to what you see in the LCD (or the viewfinder).  This is especially important, since in other brands (Sony, especifically), the LCD is artificially brighter, so pictures would seem brighter and clearer in the LCD than when actually printed (or downloaded), which would be a big letdown when you get your prints.  Do note however, that the S2IS LCD does provide a \"higher brightness\" option for use in brighter, sunny days.The flash performance was very important to me, and I am glad that it works wonderfully.  I have tested the flash in low light and in pitch black darkness, and the photos come out fully focused and with great brightness.  I tested a distance beyond the 18 ft. specified maximum range, and the pictures came out very well lit, at all zoom levels.  Specifically, I took a picture of a lit candle in total darkness 20 ft. away with 12X zoom, and the photo came out fully focused, and well lit, including the backgroundand and surroundings.  The flash is high enough from the lens that red eye is not a problem.  But at the same time, not too high that it casts a \"shadow\" under the targets.The image stabilization system works impecably.  Even with maximum optical zoom (12X), and a somewhat shaky hand, absolutely all pictures came out fully focused, bright and with no decrease in resolution.  When taking videos, the quality is great, and again, fully focused even with 12X zoom. I have dowloaded pictures and videos to my computer and TV, and I was blown away by the clarity and overall quality in both cases.  The included software package is easy to install and very versatile.Just one fact to point out.  If the LCD will be your primary way of viewing your pictures (instead of prints), or if LCD size is the major factor in your consideration for a digital camera, then this camera is not for you.  I was willing to sacrifice to a relatively smaller LCD size (1.8 inch) in order to obtain superior printed pictures at the $500 price point.The camera comes bare with no accessories.  I believe that important accessories include a compact case, a high capacity memory card (my camera came with a free 256 MB SD card, and I bought an additional 1GB), and long lasting (2500 mh) rechargeable NimH batteries.All in all, this camera far exceeded my expectations.

The zoom was certainly an important feature as I intend to keep a safe distance between me and the nearest python. I took this camera out of the box and took a photograph of an azalea blossom (using the close-up zoom) that is remarkable. Every vein in the blossom is clear as day, and there are beeds of moisture in the photo that otherwise would be barely visible to the naked eye.I found the instructional booklet to be very clear and concise.  Among other features, this Canon provides a setting that lets you choose the type of environment in which you are shooting (indoors, the beach, the snow, night scene, etc).  Once on this setting, the camera automatically adjusts its settings to give you professional quality photos.  I've had it now for a week and the photos I have taken are terrific. While I did initially see some of the blurriness another reviewer complained of, the more familiar I became with this camera and its features, the better the shots have become. I am very pleased with this choice.Two points:  First, I had hoped to be able to save some money by using the same memory card for this camera that I have in my Canon Powershot S400. (The Sony uses a Memory Stick, for use only in Sony products). Turns out - the memory cards for the two Canon cameras are of different sizes, and the IS 2 is sold with only a 16 mb card - which holds only six photos!!  This seems to be a common practice among all manufacturers which I find insulting.  Would it break the bank to give us a card of moderate utility??Second, the Canon camera case that is made for this camera fits it very snugly and has a small internal pouch for an extra memory card. While it does not have a strap, you can fit the camera strap into the case and use that strap as your carrying strap. The case also has a belt-loop that lets you carry it on your belt.  That said, it lacks space for extra batteries and I think it looks decidedly purse-like.

An example was taking time-delayed shots of our entire family.  But frankly, you can just put the S2 on auto and fire away.At the highest resolution I put 327 shots on one 512GB card.  The software to download and edit the shots is very straightforward.  Even with considerable review on the camera, I'm just on my second set of AA batteries.If you've read the other, more comprehensive reviews, you'll know you need to invest in higher storage and some rechargeables.

I've used many cameras over the years, from point-and-shoot to completely manual. I really researched this camera.The bottom line for me is how many of the pictures I'm happy with. This camera takes better pictures than anything I've used. Perhaps only 1 out of 100 is not quite in focus or blurred. That's a great ratio.I've taken superb close-ups at 12x zoom of a bee flying up to a flower. The bee and flower are perfectly in focus with the bee's wings frozen in mid-beat. The background is perfectly out of focus, just as it should be. I've taken excellent 360 degree panoramas of mountain vistas. Shots of people are especially nice if you use the \"people\" setting.It's hard to take a bad photo with this camera!A few of the pluses:- Excellent image stabilization- Superb full TV resolution video- Very good user interface- Comfortable to hold- Very good button layout- Uses regular AA batteries (use NiMH)- Uses common SD cardsThe manual pop-up flash is actually a great idea. I thought auto pop-up would be better but it is very easy to pop it up and it gives you much better control over when to use it, for example with fill flash.I recommend the leather case and the leather strap. And get at least one 1GB card so that you can do movies up to 7 minutes long.I could go on and on.

It was easy enough to use right out of the box to start taking pictures but a year later I am still figuring out cool stuff that it does.  (I could've read the manual carefully and figured it out earlier but I didn't).I bought it because my first digital (an Olympus 550) was nearing it's demise and I had enough experience to justify spending the extra money for a nicer more advanced camera.  As much as I would've loved to buy an SLR, I couldn't afford one at the time.  This camera has plenty of features to keep you busy and the 12x zoom is great.  Even though it's only a 5.0 megapixel camera, I haven't had many problems making large prints from the photos I've taken. Some people don't like the fact that you have to manually control the flash, but I like having the option to put it up or leave it down when I want, without having to push buttons in the middle of composing a shot.While most of the camera is pretty self explanatory and easy to use, I have had a little trouble figuring out the shutter priority mode and as a result, a lot of action shots have come out quite blurry, and I'm also trying to get better at night pictures.  A tripod would help and I've found that the P setting takes better night shots than the Night Snapshot scene mode. Yes it takes up more battery and storage space, but the picture results are worth it.The only other complaint that I've seen is that the lens cap doesn't like to stay on very snugly.  Another reviewer a year ago wrote that if you stick the string under the cap before putting it on, the cap won't fall off.  I've used this little trick and it's worked great.This camera also seems to be pretty durable. It's survived quite a few falls on concrete and has a few small scratches, but nothing that's affected the picture quality. I also banged the back edge of the display (the hard part) into a metal railing, and while it left quite a dent, the actual display screen is still perfect.Overall, this camera gives you great control but has plenty of auto features and cool extras. I've purchased additional filters and have enjoyed experimenting wtih them as well.

I don't know that I could say anything more, but I'd like to add another rave review anyway.This camera is a peach.  The auto settings are fairly good, and once you delve into the custom/advanced settings you'll see how amazing this product is.  I'm virtually a newbie to anything more advanced than a point and shoot, and I'd like to say that the user interface is simple to understand and allows a newbie to get the hang of the settings quickly and easily.  It's very customizable, user friendly, and intuitive.One thing I would like to note (because I haven't read much about it in the reviews) is the battery usage..I had a Pentax for a brief period and that puppy would burn through a set of batteries in about 2 hours.I've had my Canon S2 IS for a week today.  I've practically lived with it.  Taken close to 2,000 high res. large shots, and guess what, I've only used one set of disposable batteries, and am now on my \"maiden voyage\" charge of Nimh's..  and it's still going strong after a week.  Even though this camera has an astounding lens, fabulous zoom, and many many customizable settings and abilities, what impresses me most (aside from the beautiful clarity of the photos) is the battery usage.  I mean come on, a crappy little point and shoot pentax could only snap 150 pics per battery set (and uploading them to the comp sucked the life right out of those puppies), and I'm close to 2,000 pics, and have my S2 IS plugged into my computer once or twice a day, anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes at a pop, I'm editing and deleting pics from the camera almost every time I turn it on, fiddling with the settings/focus/exposure constantly and I'm STILL runing strong-- AFTER A WEEK.It's a thing of joy.-As for the lens cap complaints, I haven't had a problem with mine.  It fits firmly enough to not slide off when carrying the camera around, but is loose enough to pop off if you accidentally turn it on- thus preventing you from scratching your lens.. and I do believe that is the purpose of a more 'relaxed' fitting lens cap.As for the darkening screen when you're shooting in bright light, well, my first instinct is to say \"try watching your tv in bright sunlight and see if you can see any better\"  that's the nature of a screen, it's only so bright and when you take it into glaring sunlight, naturally you won't see it as well.  However, it does have the tilt option so you can angle it to see better, and if all else fails, you've got the oldschool view finder that you can use, so I think the \"dark lcd screen\" complaints are pretty baseless since there are ways around it.I do suggest buying a set of tripods.  One full sized, and one mini.  While shooting in the auto settings, you won't get much blur at all, but once you venture into low light shooting, or well, a lot of your custom settings that require macro or lowered shutter speeds, you'll need a tripod to steady your shot.--and make sure your camera bag is big enough.  The leather bag Canon suggests isn't nearly large enough.  I've got the Tamrac Digital 6 and it's just big enough for my needs right now (charger, extra batteries, extra memory card, av cables, lens cleaning goodies), but I can see that in the future, once I begin switching out lenses, I'll need a much much larger bag to accomodate everything.The camera itslef is a bit heavier than most, almost similar to an analog 35mm's weight, but you'll get used to it quickly and have no problem \"one handing\" it when needed. -- and it's very comfortable to hold with all of the buttons in a logical and ergonomic arrangement.All in all, I don't have one single complaint about this camera, and I think most of the complaints that you might read on the S2 IS are from people who didn't understand the instructions, or didn't consider the engineering behind certain aspects of the design (lens cap and dark lcd screen).", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable Super Macro Shots and more....", "Author": "John A. Oathout \"RebateKing\"", "ReviewID": "R2MJA0NWDBRWPA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like so many other reviewers here I debated between the Sony H2 and the Canon IS S2.  Ultimately I ordered the Sony but alas - the order was cancelled and a week later the Canon came up for sale - so I bought it.  I'm SO glad now that's the way things worked out.  I'm big time into macro photography and the capabilities of this camera are outstanding in my opinion.  It's amazing what you don't see when you are taking a macro shot that shows up on the actual picture with this camera.  Minute leafhoppers, pollen grains, details of plants you didn't know existed - the list goes on.  Having the ability to take an excellent shot of anything so tiny just opens up a whole new world in creative photography.  If you don't believe that?  Just check out the incredible macro shots from the Canon here at Amazon.Even thought the Sony H2 and the Canon IS S2 appear near equal in the specs - I kept coming back to the photos here at Amazon.  The Canon's somehow appear sharper, more colorful, and with things like the color accent mode which I've yet to use - more creative - in my opinion.  Then there's the macro shots.  No comparison here.  Canon slam dunks that one.The camera's capabilities on the other end of the spectrum are equally adept.  A Mississippi Kite hiding out in a tall pecan tree on a windy day?  No problem.  Could even see the sharp raptor curve at the end of its beak.So the camera addresses two issues that have been just driving me crazy for the past 3 or so years.  Why is it that my 5 year old Sony Digital8 video camera took better macro shots and had a more capable optical zoom than the megabuck still digital cameras on the market?  With the Canon?  This is no longer the case.  While the Sony has a 15x zoom and the Canon has a 12x the Canon can pretty much equal that with a little nudge on the digital zoom size.  Plus the Sony could do 1.2 mega pixel while the Canon does 5.  Finally - I no longer have to lug around the Sony to take macros or make sure I can zoom like I need to.Everyday shots of the kids are a breeze to take, bright, beautiful, and in focus - indoors or out.And WOW what an added bonus to have the video capabilities of this camera!  Since SD storage cards are getting cheaper by the minute extended videos are definitely a possibility.  I picked up a 2 gig card for forty bucks after rebates.  Works great.No camera is perfect and a few gripes are in order.  I agree with some users here that the camera feels a little cramped in your hand.  I find myself accidentally hitting a few buttons I didn't mean to.  Then there's the lens cap - no reason to beat that one to death - but one user's ingenious solution of affixing a small sliver of soft Velcro to the inside rim of the cap works beautifully to keep the cap snug and not flopping off.  The Sony H2 no doubt has a better LCD display too - big and bright - according to those reviewers.  The Canon can wash out in bright sunlight.  The thing is though - the Canon's auto focus works so consistently well it's questionable whether or not for a lot of shots you even need to frame the picture!  I held the camera way over my head today for a picture of my son's band playing outdoors.  Click.  Done.  Perfect picture.  The Canon's picture cycle time can be a little slow too.  So if you are trying to catch multiple snaps of the Loch Ness monster as it descends into the inky depths - forget it.  You'll probably only get one shot with this camera - but boy, chances are it will be a history making clear picture highlighting Nessie's bloodshot eyes!I have quite a few gripes here so why still a 5 star rating?  Because when you are sitting in front of your computer marveling at the pictures you've just taken you forget about those issues - particularly if you got the camera at a bargain price.  The Canon simply scores big where it needs to most - taking great pictures!", "Date": "May 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Super Pleased Prosumer", "Author": "tourist76", "ReviewID": "RBZ0CCHQOBJH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about 8 months now. I can safely say there is very little more I could ask for in a digital camera. 5MP is an excellent image size for every-day use, and keeps the file management reasonable. I generally keep it at 50 ISO, I find there is no noticable colour noise at 50-100 ISO. This camera takes excellent shots in low light, of course there is noise if you have little to no light - if you were using film, you would have film grain - It is a very similar effect to using 1600 ISO film in low light. The movie mode is FANTASTIC. At max res, you get about 9 mins for a 1GB file. The sound quality and sensitivity is very good. There is no external mic port and no hot shoe. I can't really complain though.If you are serious about taking lots of video with this camera, get atleast 6 or 7 high-speed SD cards 1 or 2 GB will do, and get a DVD Recorder. This will allow you to take about an hour of video at a go, and burning the video direct to DVD is the fastest  way to deal with the files. I recommend the Sony DVDirect (DVD direct) device for being portable and easy to use, it creates a chapter break each time you stop the recorder). The zoom in conjunction with the video mode is excellent. You can only take a maximum of a 1GB video file (9 mins).Features I love on this camera:- 12X zoom is excellent- image stabilization is very good- image quality and size are perfect for everyday use- tons of picture modes allow flexability and creativity for advanced users eg. up to 15 sec time exposures- super adjustable functions, which are changable on the fly- MOVIE MODE allows you to take 5 mega pixel pictures while taking video!!!- vivid colour mode allows all your picutes to look more saturated- videos taken at night require very little light to actually see what's going on - they still look great! 30 frames per second is great!- very fast start-up time!Areas for improvement:- RAW picture capture would be awesome!- bigger LCD screen would be awesome- lens-cap that sticks better- more compressed video- faster auto-focus (it would be great if it could be as fast as the D70)Overall, this is a great camera.

I also bought 2 sets of rechargeable batteries, and a 512mb and 1GB SD ULTRA II cards.  Camera was great, took close to 400 pictures.

Battery life is exceptionally long. This camera can do it all. When I opened the package, I was a little intimidated with all the manuals and paperwork that came with it, but after reviewing them it was a cinch to use this beauty.

The 5MP plus the 12x zoom provides all of the resolution for anybody but the professional.As I use this camera more and more, I get more impressed by the ergonomics of it. Not just that it's comfortable in the hand, but for example: No need to go to Movie Mode to make a movie. Just hit the button and it starts recording. Hit it again- it stops,and you're right back in still mode.This is not a pocket camera. That's the decision you have to make. If you just want to pull a camera out of your pocket and make some snaps, go with the Elphs. But for greater flexibility at the expense of size, this it excellent.I highly recommend the lens adapter for this. It protects the lens body in case you drop it, and you can put a UV filter on, which really helps, plus keeps dust off the actual lens.

I've had a series of digital cameras including Canon G2, Olympus 5060 etc and this is by far the fastest of the bunch. On all the others there was a noticeable processing time delay; on this camera it almost always snaps the shot right away!3) The same LCD I came to love on the G2 that flips out and twirls around. This is invaluable for getting good shots with the camera above your head, I often use it when taking pictures of my food for website restaurant reviews.4) Great video settings, you can really take some high res quality video footage if you have enough memory!In addition, the menus are easy to use and things like picture resolution settings are very easy to access (as opposed to being buried in the menu system somewhere!). I find that 5MP is plenty for my web pictures and I think for most people it is perfectly adequate. Downloading pictures is very easy via the supplied USB cable, doesn't seem to require a special driver the way my old G2 did.The things I don't love so much:1) The camera is a bit on the bulky side; but then so were my other cameras so I'm used to that. At least it is pretty lightweight for its size.2) I'm not such a big fan of the flip out flash, several times I take a nighttime photo and wonder why the flash didn't go off!

The only reason that I waited so long to buy this S2 IS is that its predecessor S1 IS is only 3 mega pixel. After using Olympus C-765 and Konica Minolta Z5, I have to say, Canon makes the best digital cameras. Here are the highlights of my opinion.Pro (what the Olympus' and Konica Minolta's counterpart lacks)* Superb image quality (this is also agreed by dpreview.com). Image quality is not just mega pixel, but also the clarity and sharpness.*** Canon cameras produce less \"noise\" than other brand. In case you don't know what noise in photography means, it looks like random sand grain on a low-light photo. Konica Minolta is very very bad in terms of noise. If you can avoid vibration (e.g. with the help of a tripod), Canon S2 IS is ideal in all scenario. However, don't expect you can take anything decent with Z5 under in-door scenario without flash.*** Good JPEG compression. The more compressed, the lower the image quality, but the more it can store on a memory card. So there is always a trade-off, and everyone has their optimal balance/compromise between file size and image quality. I find Canon's compression optimal for me. Olympus' compression is way too compressed. I can actually see the dots around high contrast edges with naked eyes, without enlargement. That is how it led me to verify the fact by some computer software. If you take a lot of geometric objects like architectures, this is the camera for you.* FAST!! With DIGIC II processor, turning on, off, shooting is much faster. And zoom is also very fast (due to the ultra-sonic motor)* Better operation interface. A simple thing like \"2 second review window\" where one has the chance to immediately remove a bad picture makes Canon more pleasurable to use.* tilt-and-swivel LCD monitor. Great for self portrait, and unusual shooting angel (e.g. shooting from above head)* You can add additional converter lens. Cannon offers a 1.5x telephoto and 0.75x wide. With the existing 12x zoom, you can get 18x optical zoom or 72x digital combined zoom. This is how some people shoot the moon.* Super macro mode. You can shoot the micro print off a paper money (a very small text as an anti-counterfeit device. It is available on the 5 dollars bill or higher. see my pictures)* Long battery life. Using 4 AA size rechargeable batteries (capacity around 8000 ~ 9600 mAh), S2 IS lasts much longer than Olympus C-765 (1050 mAh)Cons* Movie files are not compressed enough* The official 0.75x wide converter lens is not wide enough for meIn conclusion: I will keep this camera for a long time.", "Date": "October 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great for nature photography", "Author": "thedest", "ReviewID": "R1TH8SWBRFM7YG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera.

I was able to get great zoom and closeup shots, some even from a moving Zodiak.  Other pluses I discovered for were the fast startup and shut down times, ease of shifting from photo to movie, non-automatic pop-up flash (flash photography is forbidden for Galapagos wildlife).

Added updates to the likes and dislikes.What I like- Image stabilization. I took a one-second hand-held exposure. No shake recorded. Bliss.- Gobs of zoom. 12x optical is very nice for isolating subjects from the background. Warning, use conservatively for portraits, too much zoom isolates the subject but also flattens faces. Nicest for creating abstracts, for textures and macro photography- Nice auto mode for normal use, but lots of custom options and all the features you see in pro cameras plus a bunch of others thrown in - Shutter priority, aperture priority, all kinds of timer functions, macro mode, manual focus- Auto bracketing feature for those shots where you aren't terribly sure. One click takes three shots with an adjustible exposure range for exposure bracketing, haven't used focus bracketing.- Focus is fast and pretty good - I was able to focus on a hovering bumblebee- Flash doesn't pop up automatically. It warns you in the display that a flash is needed, but I LOVE the fact that the flash cannot come on unless you manually pop it up. I hate using the flash. With the stabilization mode, you can go as low as 1/6 sec if you remain steady and let the feature help you.- 30FPS 640x480 video is nice, especially when combined with the 12x zoom. You can take pictures during the video at full res, but they do interrupt the video clip for a second.- Flash is nicer and less pathetic than the ones in small cameras like Digital elphs, when you have to use it.- Smartness - plug the USB cable in and it turns on and goes to Play mode. Elphs don't. You never notice until you switch back to an elph.- Consistency. If you used a digital elph this is easy to get used to, even though the controls look different.- Battery life is decent though I'm using 2300mAH NiMH AA's.- The screen can be rotated for composing those on-floor or overhead shots. Very versatile.What I don't care for much:- Screen is small. The SD 550's screen has spoiled me rotten. The low resolution on this screen can misrepresent a picture by making it look OK until you see it at full resolution. The picture also looks terrible when it's not too bad on screen, be careful you don't delete something until you see it on a larger screen first.- Where the small screen fails me: When taking high-magnification shots, sometimes the focus gets to the background instead of the subject. I couldn't tell from the little screen that I had messed up that shot. Ideally, for the level of zoom this offers, the screen should be even bigger. The LCD viewfinder didn't help either.- 5MP? When I have the SD 550 and the S2IS, there's always that missing 2.1MP nagging me. The larger lens can make the picture more vivid, but ultimately the higher resolution would get it closer to a film camera.- Cheap plasticky feel. SD 550 feels solid. This feels toyish but the same material probably would have added weight.- Macro mode is kind of odd to reach, OK after learning.- ISO 400 setting is as noisy as that of the Digital Elphs. ISO 200 is tolerable if you want to trade-off between noise and flash. No comparison to DSLR's whose ISO 1600 mode is even clearer than the ISO 200 here.- Size. I can't bring myself to carry this around while I have the SD550 in my pocket. I might as well carry a DSLR if I have to lug something around my neck, though this is a nice all in one package that doesn't need additional lenses.- Lens cap - falls off too easily (bad). If you go to rec mode, the lens pops it off (good)- I like battery packs for their efficiency, over having to replace four different AA batteries. Not good while on the go.- I used the intervalometer recently, and it seems limited, with a 1-minute minimum interval for a maximum total of 100 pictures. Shorter intervals and more pictures (500, 999) would have been nice.- RAW mode and high-end CCD a la EOS digital rebel is on my wishlist here.", "Date": "March 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "solid choice", "Author": "E.

The S2 IS was a solid buy for me.  I use it often to take a variety of pictures, from portraits to action shots.  I really enjoy its low light capabilities - I would rarely use the flash in indoor shots and the pictures I take all come out with great exposure.  Shooting macro with the S2 IS is a cinch and the detail that I get from this 5MP digital is quite impressive.The camera has an intuitive design and easy interface.  That seemingly big bulky handgrip comes in handy on windy days or when your shooting from a moving vehicle (or a trolley!)  Canon loves mode dials and so do I.  I also like how the screen flips out and clicks to multiple viewing positions, though it's a bit small and washed out in the sun like all screens do.  Uploading the photos onto my computer is quick and easy thanks to the included USB cable.I've tried most of the features on the camera.  Took great pics of the redwoods using the foliage scene setting.  Made a mini movie of my dog chasing tennis balls that was limited only by the capacity of my memory card.  And I used Canon's Stitch Assist software (on the cd that is bundled with the camera) to create a stunning panoramic of San Francisco from Twin Peaks.Since buying this camera in April '06 I've actually dropped it twice!

Why? It's smaller, easier to carry, has the extended zoom range, and uses AA batteries. It's better to have a camera that you'll actually take with you, than one that takes great photos but is awkward to travel with or carry so it stays at home.While everyone goes on about how great the image stabilizer is with the long lense, (which is is) it also shines when you're in a low light situation, like a museum, where you can't use flash. I have a great collection of art photos from museums around the country that I could have never taken with one of our Nikon D70s without a tripod.The only limitations I find in the S2 is that it doesn't have an especially wide angle view, but none of the \"ultra-zoom\" cameras do, so it's not something you can fault it for.For low light, another stop in the ISO (from 400 to 800) would be nice, which Canon has put on the S3, so if you want that feature you can get it.While the camera will do most anything in manual and specialized modes, you don't have to know anything about cameras to get good pictures, and I've handed it to a half-dozen novices to use for the day and they've all come back with good shots.I've had many brands of digital cameras, Olympus, Fuji, Sony, Nikon, and Casio, and for point and shoots, Canon just does it right. (For D-SLRS, however, I have to go with the Nikons.)As far as mega-pixels, the reality of it is that most of the time you'll be reducing the size of your pictures to use them on the internet on in e-mails, so unless you need the extra features and plan to make big prints, the S2 has plenty of resolution for most purposes, which makes it a great deal price-wise.", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best camera I've owned!", "Author": "Richwiu1", "ReviewID": "R1G3JEHMTRXFDG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned half a dozen different film and digital point and shoot cameras in the last 10+ years and this is the first one I would unreservedly recommend to a beginner/semi-serious amateur. My two biggest beefs with the p&s; cameras I've owned before have been short battery life and limited zoom capability. I absolutely hate rechargeable lithium ions. This camera has rechargeable NiMH's and I have been amazed at how long the batteries last. I can shoot several 1 gig SD cards full of pictures and video and upload them to my PC several times (about a week's worth of shooting for me) before the batteries need to be recharged. I bought an extra set of rechargeables but if push comes to shove, I can throw in some alkaline AA's and keep on shooting. My other big beef, limited zoom capability, is also answered with the S2IS. I have kids in school band and I've always had trouble getting decent pictures. Between the zoom capability of the camera and the image stabilizer, I no longer have that problem. I bought the S2IS primarily as a camera but the quality of the video, except in low light, has been an added bonus. I've never been a big video shooter but I now find myself shooting a lot more. I bought a 2 GB SD card and can get about 15 minutes worth of video on that. For short clips, it's fantastic. The S2IS also has some nice accessories available for the more serious amateur. I just bought the slave flash unit but have not experimented much with it yet. I plan to buy the telephoto attachment which will extend the zoom range even further. The big test for this camera will be my family's month long trip to Ireland in July.

But taking my FE2 to my business trips is simply to much space and weight, so my photo production decreased significantly.2 years ago I bought a Canon SD400, my first digital camera, very nice, but you can not control depth of field, although you can control exposure using point metering and fixing exposure to some other point in the picture.  I recovered a hobby I very much enjoy, I always took the camera with me.When I bought the Canon S2 IS, I seriously considered a SRL, I still have several Nikon lenses.

With an SRL taking a picture at over 200mm, or a macro picture, without a tripod can be shaky, with the S2 the image stabilization feature gives crisp sharp pictures.I easily got used to the menus with my SD400, the S2 shares similar menus.

Fast on time, focust time, sequential picture mode. Sharp capable optics with 12x optical zoom. Excellent movie mode. Decent price at $500.Weaknesses: Picture slightly oversharpened. Noise at ISO 200. Some autofocus/autoexposure difficulties. No wireless remote. 1GB movie size limit. No Hot Shoe. No lens filter to protect lens.Summary: Have taken about 6.5GB worth of pictures and movies with this camera. I am not needing to use my movie camera anymore (have not had to in my last 2 weekend trips).Key positives for me:1. Takes sharp pictures.2. Fast enough so that I do not lose the perfect photo moment.3. 12x zoom so that I can get close, and achieve the limited depth of field of a long lens.4. Take movies in stereo sound, with optical zoom capability. A 1GB card can take about 7mins of 640x 30fps video. So for casual everyday events (parties, weekend trips), this is all the camera you need. I can see myself needing the DV for graduations, sporting events, musicals, etc.5. Uses standard SD memory. I am using ATP (1GB) and Transcend (512MB) and are happy with both. These are fast cards that enhance the fast write capabilities of this camera.6. Uses standard AA batteries -- 2200ah nimhs lasted me 2.5 GB of pics/movies in a weekend.7. Variable Angle LCD allows pictures to be taken from awkward angles (not even available with Digital SLRs).8. No wireless remote but the custom self timer is great. Can set to take the 5 shots in 30 secs so that I can take my time to get to my spot in the pics.I had an Olympus C3040 (died recently), and so I was spoiled by its excellent picture quality and ability to take pictures even in low light (f1.8). But it was very slow, and so I missed a lot of picture moments, plus 3x optical won't handle musicals, football games.The Powershot S2 allows me to acquire all the above features, with a minor compromise on picture quality, at half the price of entry level DSLR. And I get some of the features missing from a DSLR -- movie mode, variable angle LCD, light weight.Very compelling proposition.

So I called Canon and they have asked that I UPS (at my own cost) the camera to their repair facility and they will pay for shipping it back to me.  so lets see how this works out.  I will try to post an update when i get it back.i also read another person's question here and didn't know how to respond - so here goes.  Yes, you can use a 2GB SD card on this camera - I use one on mine though i must admit, even with my setting to get the highest precision pictures i never seem to use more than a GB before I want to download the pictures and label them and get prints ;-)  but yeah, maybe in a longer vacation the 2 GB will be great! ;-)*****a second update on this.  got the camera pic - repaired by canon factory services for free - excluding one way shipping cost.  shipped - 1/20, accepted - 1/24, repaired and shipped back - 1/26, got it back - 1/30and loving the camera all over again and clicking a ton of baby pictures again ;-)", "Date": "January 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great!  ...just read the manual for best results.", "Author": "B. T. Denyer \"UX Designer\"", "ReviewID": "R233OS98DF8IGZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We found that reading the manual will yield the best results.  I know this sounds very obvious, but not everyone does this (me, being one of those people.)We found that the shutter is MUCH FASTER than my Sony DSCP10 Cyber-shot.  MUCH faster.  My Sony is s-l-o-w to take a picture; whereas the Canon focuses, computes and takes the picture in under a second.  My Sony could take up to 5 seconds!  The Canon's responsiveness is very close to that of a normal 35mm film camera (SLR.)  This could be a big deal if you are taking pictures of quick cats or slippery kids, or anything else that is good at dodging the camera.The overall feel of camera is solid and lasting.  I have my doubts that if I dropped this on cement that the lens and body will be able to take the blow, but I have yet found a reason to test this out and haven't had the opportunity to do so accidentally.  The buttons feel good, should survive some repeated use and are well-placed.  Maybe with the exception of the shutter button: I found it a little difficult to hold the camera with one hand while pointing it at me and my wife (you know, the obligatory self-portrait-picture-taking when no one is around to do it for you.)  The shutter button is on the top-front of the camera and I found it hard to get my finger on it AND hold it.  No biggie, just noticed it.However, we noticed that a finger on our left hand covered the Auto-Focus lens when gripping the camera in a natural manner.  I also noticed that it wasn't just us; I witnessed a couple hand this very same camera to a stranger to take their picture and she immediately placed her finger over the Auto-Focus lens.  Why does this matter?  The camera sends out a beam to judge the distance and focus the lens - cover it and the camera can't focus properly.  The viewing screen is small enough that you might not notice the out of focus picture until you get home.Another issue: pictures look BEAUTIFUL on the little flip-out screen, but when downloaded we saw that some looked very much out of focus (operator error, not the camera.)  Point: the little screen makes all of the pictures look good, so take two or more shots to be sure!YOU MUST BUY RECHARGABLE BATTERIES!  You paid enough for the camera, so you pay hundreds more in batteries??  This camera needs four (4) AA batteries, and can go through them by the time you fill up a 1 GB card.  The little flip-out screen will consume your batteries' life, so I HIGHLY recommend two sets of four 2500 mAh AA rechargeable batteries that you can rotate through.  (You will thank me after you get half-way through your day and your regular batteries are dead.)A really cool feature is the Diopter Adjustment.  This will be VERY beneficial for those that wear glasses but DON'T wear them while looking through the view finder (some of us don't always use the little flip-out screen.)  You can dial in an adjustment so that the display information will appear clearly.  There are many LITTLE icons around the edges of the viewing area in the view finder, and if you can't see them or your subjects clearly because you have taken off your glasses then your picture taking will suffer.The pictures we have taken with this Powershot are crispy, clear and close to life-like color (which means less PhotoShopping later.)  BUT! you must configure your camera's \"SCN\" (Special Scene Mode) to match your environment in order to take great pictures!  This includes Foliage, Snow, Beach, Fireworks, Indoor, and Night Snapshot.  This won't be your only adjustment, but it will take you from out-of-the-box to shooting-better-pictures quickly.I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "December 29, 2005"}, {"Title": "Cannon S2 IS or Sony DSC H1", "Author": "J.

Both cameras have some wonderful options and both have some drawbacks.  Remember while reading this I am no professional just a mom who loves to take pitures of her kids and these are just my opinions.  I chose the Cannon for two important reasons to me.  The first being I loved the way the colors came out rich and bright in the Cannon photos.  The colors seemed deep and true whereas the Sony's especially those taken outdoors, seemed a little blueish and washed out.  The other reason was the flash on the Cannon.  The Sony flash seemed a little too strong and washed out all my indoor pictures.  There were some situations where using the Cannon indoors I didn't even need the flash but when I tried the same picture with the Sony and no flash there just didn't seem to be enough light.  The Sony does have a great huge LCD screen and the viewfinder I think is a little clearer and sharper than the Cannon but not enought to make a huge difference.  I also liked the fact that the Sony only required two AA batteries whereas the Cannon requires four making the Sony a little more cost effective and possibly slightly lighter.  The Cannon uses a SD card the Sony uses only Sony memory sticks.  Since I have many SD cards the Cannon ended up winning in my decision.  I also took into consideration that the telephoto button on the Cannon was on the front of the camera unlike most other cameras near the shutter button.  The Sony's is on the back of the camera.  Because I have smaller hands it was harder to hold the Sony and use the telephoto holding the camera with only one hand.  It is really important when deciding between these two cameras to hold them and try them for yourself.  Like I said they are both great but the Cannon S2 IS is the one for me. Where to buy it was the easy decision.  I checked everywhere and AMAZON.com had the best price.  No shipping and in my state no tax.  Good luck and Happy picture taking.Just an update to my recent review of the Cannon S2 IS.  I am loving this camera.  I got 236 pictures on the batteries that came with the camera so I am interested to see how many I will get with the new Energizer 25oo amh rechargeable batteries I am now using.

After doing this, I was so undecided since they all are great cameras and each of them have their flaws.  I checked out the Minolta Z6 at a local computer store and was impressed by the design of the camera.  It fits great in my hand, looks great, very streamline, and the highest megapixels between all three cameras at 6mp.  BUT when I zoomed in, it was very loud and it really didn't focus well.  So, I elimated the Z6.  Then I went to another store and talked to the sales person about the Canon and Sony.  They were side by side on display and I asked the person which one of the two are the big seller.  He said the Canon has been the bigger seller.  Both cameras were priced the same and he said although he likes Sony, he said the Canon out performs it when it comes to features.  Its worth it.  So, I broke down and bought the Canon S2.I was really happy about my purchase.  When I got home, I immediately played with my new camera and took a few pictures of my dog and cat.  I used to have a Canon PowerShot A300 but realized that it wasn't optical.  I wanted a camera that was a good upgrade but not like one of those expensive professional cameras.  I'm a beginner at photography so I thought this would be a good way to get started and to upgrade my photography experience.  The only thing that I don't like about this camera is the lens cap- it keeps coming off and it doesn't stay on secure.  I hope Canon finds a way to fix this problem.

W/ the filters, I can get the polarization & everything else I was used to on my SLR. My total gear pack weighs about half of what I was used to when lugging everything for a hike. A very positive change indeed.The only two things missing from this camera are the ability to shoot RAW images, and a hot shoe or PC connector for better lighting control. Canon sells a rig w/ a slave flash on it, seems o.k. but there's no way to do true off-camera lighting w/ this machine.Overall, I think this camera is everything a serious amater needs as long as you're not doing a lot of portrait work w/ sophisticated lighting. And since the S3 IS is shipping in another month, with very limited upgrades (1MP larger images, that's about it), the price is really dropping on the S2.

Last year it broke and I have been camera-less for too long. I recently decided to get back into photography and I decided I wanted to make the switch to digital. I started researching cameras here on amazon and other sites and after reading the many reviews for this one, both the good and the bad, I decided to order and see for myself. I have not been disappointed in my purchase. This camera is extremely versatile and with a little practice I believe anyone could use it. It's got great manual features and other special effects, such as macro and super macro, that make it great for people who know more about what they're doing when it comes to photography but it is also a great point-and-click camera for people just getting into photography, as well. It's got a very small learning curve and I feel almost completely comfortable with it after owning it for just a few days. I have to admit that I'm a bit confused after having read the bad reviews that said the images were constantly blurry. I mean, yes, a few images I have taken have been blurry, but if I just hold down the button to take the picture a split second longer, it focuses just fine. Also, people need to learn to use the flash; if you're trying to autofocus in a darker setting, the camera will keep the aperture open longer to get more light into the picture. That means if the subject is moving, the camera picks up all of its movement. Therefore it is blurry. It's the same with any manual film camera. So maybe these people just don't really know how to use cameras in the first place.  One of my only gripes with this camera is that the manual focus button is in a really weird location on the lens and you have to hold it down while pushing down the buttons to focus closer or farther.

Derby \"drone45\"", "ReviewID": "R7PVFZ9GLAOJG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "How To Keep Your Lens Cap From Falling Off(late addition to review already posted)Here's the best solution I've found.  Go to a hardware or home-improvement store, and buy a sheet of small, felt \"feet\".  The adhesive kind:  which you can buy cheaply in sets of 50 or more, usually in assorted sizes.  Typically they're used (in sets of four) for putting underneath items so that they don't slide around, or scratch the surfaces underneath.  But we're going to use them in a way other than intended.Peel off only one of them; I'd recommend a circle about 1/4\" in diameter.  Use scissors or utility knife (watch your fingers!) to cut it in half, being careful not to touch the adhesive too much.  You want it to remain sticky.You now have two tiny semicircles.  Affix each of them to opposite sides of the inside rim of the lens cap.  This makes the lens cap act as if it's ever so slightly \"smaller\".The result is that the lens cap won't fall off anymore, but is still easy to remove.If you find that the lens cap becomes difficult to take off, try to find an alternative method with a material of lesser thickness.Most such \"feet\" have adhesive which doesn't stick very firmly, and after a few months, your handiwork falls off the lens cap.  Then you'll have to do it again.  However, this is far preferable to using a stronger adhesive but not being able to remove or adjust the position.The most obvious fix is to tie a string to the lens cap, then tie that string to one of the two tiny loops on either side of the camera, on top.  That way, if the cap falls off, you won't lose it.The problem with this technique:  when using certain camera angles, the dangling lens cap swings in and out of the viewfinder.I use both methods.  The latter can be annoying, but for most shots, the lens cap doesn't get in the way.OK, OK...I know this review is now much too long, having already been somewhat too long in the first place.  But I suspect the preceding info will be helpful to many folks.[Original review follows]I love this camera!Working with film--more years ago than I care to admit--eventually, I gave up.  I couldn't take a sharp photo without a tripod; my hands shake too much.  A tripod is too heavy, and the set-up time kills the spontaneity.  Forget taking candid shots if you need a tripod.So a few months ago, when I heard about the \"image stabilization\" features of digital cameras, I decided to give photography another try.Looking around, I decided I wanted a non-SLR digital camera with about 5 megapixels, image stabilization and at least 10x optical zoom.I found only two cameras which met my criteria.  Sony has a similar model, but I didn't like the way it felt in my hands.  Also, its buttons are ridiculously tiny, even by modern standards of miniaturized gadgets.So I chose the Canon, and I'm glad I did.  Truly easy to use.  I love the ability to shoot as many photos as I want, without worrying about every shot adding to the cost of film and processing.  If a photo turns out a bit over- or under-exposed, usually I can fix it in Photoshop with just a bit of tweaking.The biggest drawback:  I find it difficult to get true, lifelike colors with the Canon.  This happens regardless of the white-balance settings (some of which seem to act more like color filters).  This, too, can be corrected in Photoshop.  But color correction takes more work than, say, cropping...or changing contrast/brightness (for which Photoshop's Curves feature is phenomenal; trying to set contrast and brightness separately tends to become a trial-and-error process with many steps, all of which degrade the quality of the image).However, I'm not a professional.  I don't require perfection.  It's unlikely that I'll spend the time to do a lot of Photoshop processing on more than one out of 100 images (and that's out of the promising shots:  the ones I don't simply delete from the camera).Despite image stabilization, and even in bright sunlight (where the shutter speed is fast), \"camera shake\" is still a problem.  However, I should note that my hands shake much more than the average person, due to medical reasons.If, like me, you find that image stabilization is not always enough, try using the VideoProp (model SVP-3 from Sima, if I recall correctly).  This is sort of like a miniature monopod which is worn around the neck.  You get much of the stability of a monopod or tripod, but without carrying a weighty burden, nor having to take a long time to set it up.At first, you'll find adjustments are necessary:  both to the neck strap, and the length of the pod (which telescopes).  But once you've found the sizes which work for you, it becomes simple.The VideoProp is intended for use with camcorders, but works equally well when shooting stills.  There IS one serious problem.  For the sake of quick set-up, the VideoProp's mounting bracket needs to be screwed onto the bottom of your camera at all times.  But when in place, this bracket partially covers the lid to the Canon's battery compartment!  Therefore, I have to carry a screwdriver, so that I'll be able to remove the bracket temporarily if I need to switch batteries mid-session.If this is beginning to sound more and more like it's as much inconvenience as a conventional monopod or tripod--well, as long as you already have the VideoProp ready to go before you start shooting--soon you hardly notice it.  You will, however, probably get a lot of questions from other photographers who've never seen anything like it before.Essential for me is a medium-sized camera bag by MRock.  There are \"bungee straps\" on the bottom of the bag, so that I can take the VideoProp (in the compact configuration to which it collapses, for carrying) along with the same bag.  But outside the bag:  so I don't have to worry about its metal parts banging into my precious camera, safe inside.This particular bag (the Glacier Bay #88004) is large enough to hold all my accessories, including two sets of extra batteries, a hard case where I store extra memory cards, the Canon camera's user manual, microfiber eyeglass cloths (which I find are much better for cleaning the lens than anything else I've tried), and even that screwdriver.It's not even particularly large; it's merely well-designed, with a multitude of pockets in which you can fit nearly anything you might need.  Also it's expandable, though I can't imagine why I'd do so.  Even with all the things I carry, there is plenty of space left in the bag.And no, I do not have any financial relationship to the third-party companies mentioned above.  I'm just happy I was able to get everything to work the way it should, without having to carry two or more bags everywhere I go.", "Date": "November 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great camera with a few flaws", "Author": "Millard F.

Both the viewfinder image and the LCD image on the Kodak were better -- brighter and sharper.  When I aim the S2 at a subject, the image is blurry enough that I can not tell if everyone in a group shot is smiling.  Pressing the shutter button half way down, allowing the auto focus to work, sharpens the image a lot, but still not as sharp as I was used to with the Kodak.  This is true of both the LCD and the viewfinder in any light.  After I take the pictue, I can view it in the LCD and the image is bright and sharp.  Since no other reviewer has mentioned this as an issue, it may be related to the technology and affects all cameras using this same technology.  I am hoping the problem will disappear as I become more skilled using the camera but after taking several hundred photos, it is still annoying.The second problem is that you will need to spend about $200 more than the price of the camera to get rolling.  You will need two sets of rechargable batteries, a battery charger, a 1 gig memory card and a camera case.  Oddly, the recommended camera case has no room for spare batteries.It is likely that all of these problems are problems with every other camera in this class, and none of them has stopped me from consistently great pictures.

But short videos can be interesting and, in some situations, only video can tell the story. So, I decided for a video capable digital camera. The S2 was chosen the best in this category in 2005 and, after reading tens of reviews, decided for it.The other two specs that were decisive for me were: use of SD cards (the most inexpensive of all flash cards) and AA-sized batteries (idem).Why I bought an S2 IS instead of the newer S3 IS, besides price? First: the difference in their specs are minimum (S3 has a slightly larger LCD - 0.2\" is a too small difference!; S3 has a \"sports mode\" - the users say the settings in this mode is awful; grid/histogram on shoot mode - this is a nice feature; 6Mpixels instead of 5Mpixels - more about that bellow). Second: I don't pay importation tax in my country for cameras with 5.2M pixels or less. Third: I never make large (>A4/letter size) prints, so I don't need even the 5Mpx of S2. Fourth: The CCD of both S2 and S3 are the SAME size (1/2.5\"); that means S2 (w/ 5.0 Mpixels) is more sensitive than S3 (w/6.0 Mpixels) because its photocells are bigger (less cells in the same area). This is a fact, as S2 reaches ISO 50 and the minimum in S3 is ISO 80 (higher ISO usually means more noise in digicams).One information I would like to share here is about the minimum f-stop of this camera, as this info is hard to find online (it is not even in the camera manual): f/8, which I think should reach at least f/16 or more.Overall, I am VERY SATISFIED with this camera.

I would recommend it to anybody, but some of the features would be wasted on people who just want basic point-and-shoot photography.There are other cameras that don't have all the features of this one that have a higher image resolution.  For me the selling points of this camera were the image stabilization and zoom lens, which goes up to 12x (3x is more-or-less the standard).  The image stabilization helps with taking pictures in low light and with longer shutter speeds, as well as when using the zoom lens.  I really like the swivel screen feature. The camera has a good movie mode: you can zoom while you record a video and it records sound in stereo.  You can customize a lot of the settings; for instance, the self-timer can be used in preset mode or you can specify the length of delay and the number of pictures to be taken.Less satisfactory points are that purple framing (when bright light in the background creates a purple outline on objects in the foreground) occurs more often than usual.  Also, when you turn the ISO up too high (to 400 ISO) the pictures start looking really noisy (dotty).  Despite those facts, the pictures still look great, the images are sharp, the colors are bright, and the zoom doesn't distort the pictures at all.One thing to note about the flash is that it does not pop up automatically; you have to manually lift up the flash.  That's good and bad: the good is that the flash won't pop up when you don't want it to; the bad is that you tend to forget about it, but the camera indicates when it should be on.", "Date": "January 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Canon S2 IS Review, highlights and lowlights", "Author": "Mauricio Rincon \"the rink\"", "ReviewID": "R177OAEBHI65LG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I previously owned a small canon digital camara and learning to use this one was very easy.

Having said that, I still think I got a great deal and more camera than I expected.  This is not a top of the line Rebel, but it is a *serious* upgrade for those with entry level point-and-shoot cameras who want more camera for not much more money.I bought the Powershot S2 as a \"last year's model\" and saved about half the retail price after the S3 was released.  After I checked reviews on both Digital Photography Review and Steve's Digicams websites, I knew what to expect.  I was aware, for instance that the flash is not automatic -- you must pop up the flash before shooting indoors or in backlit situations.  I also knew the memory card is SD format (smaller than my existing memory cards) and the flip out viewfinder could be a bit brighter and the eyepiece on the standard viewfinder could use a bigger cup.Even so, I like the 4AA batteries in the grip (nice camera balance), I like the size of the camera and was pleasantly surprised by the S2's ease of use and the 12x optical zoom.  Pictures are crisp, the color is good and the viewfinders are virtually 100% of the actual picture [bonus: the flip out viewfinder protects itself when not in use and enables self-portraits].This camera performs very well in high volume situations and action shots.  It is particularly well suited to families with kids in sports and extra curricular activities.  The 12x optical zoom keeps you close to your kid even when you are on the sidelines and the quiet zoom motor won't distract from piano recitals, weddings, etc.A note about the movie mode, this camera takes movies that are equal to our Sony digital Handycam -- with a couple of 1-2GB SD cards the S2 eliminates the need for two cameras on holidays -- there is a 1GB limit on movies, which gives you about 7-10 minutes of video.There are so many features to this camera, I'd strongly suggest you spend at least 30 minutes going through it before going out with the camera.  Even so, I have handed this camera to a stranger, pointed to the shutter button and said \"take 2 shots, just in case\" with great results.I have a Canon AE-1 SLR, and the Pentax that Steve Erwin used to do ads for.

I did not like the fact that Canon took away the ability for us to fit on a filter to protect the lens just so that they could sell us an optional bulky device to fit filters on (They will probably make the lens an option next time around). This is a big deal given that the lens cap fits very loosely and falls off at the slightest touch - I cant tell you how many times I have accidently touched the lens when reaching for the camera.Additionally, the manual focusing/macro focusing buttons are not the least bit intuitive.  In this, Canon can take some lessons from the Minolta Dimage....the manual focus is true manual focus - the outside ring turns to manually focus the camera.  With the Canon, you have to remember what combination of buttons to press to manually focus.The compartment that stores the SD card is neatly fitted onto the side and slides open with some pressure, and then rotates neatly to the side - well done.  Just above that compartment, where Canon could have used a similarly-styled compartment for the USB connections - if for no other reason than consistency - it has chosen to use a cheap rubber flap that gets in the way of the USB plug.The optics and electronics worked wonderfully for just over a year and then something went wrong and my camera stopped working.

The movie mode was great too, so I didn't need to carry my camcorder.Of course it's no Rebel XT, but this camera compares poorly in terms of image quality even with the A20 and A70. Actually, the A20 took the best pictures of all the Powershots I owned.On paper it's a very good camera, but I cannot say I am satisfied, even after some six months using it. Here are the problems:* The image has a lot of noise, especially in light colored shaded areas, EVEN IN DAYLIGHT! Reviewing my old pictures taken with the A20 and the A70, I can assure that none of them showed the problem.* I see a lot of chromatic aberration at maximum zoom, even halfway from the center to the border of the picture. One can say \"what would you expect for the price\"? But what good is a 12X zoom if you take crappy pictures then? BTW, neither the A20 nor the A70 showed the same level of chromatic aberration at their's (3X) maximum zoom.* It complains that the batteries are low much too early. Not only did the batteries lasted way more on the A20 ad A70 using both Ni-MH and alkalines, the recharging takes 20 minutes instead of the regular one hour, showing that the batteries still have juice. Same for the alkalines: \"expended\" batteries from this camera last a lot in other equipment.* The movie format is not very compressed due to the codec used, so the movie mode takes a lot of room in the card, much more that it should had they used something like MPEG2.* The lens cap is really horrible (see other reviews).The camera works, the stabilization is nice, the movie mode works well for small clips, though focus can be slow sometimes. If you are not very particular about image quality you might live with the other shortcomings.A further tip: I use both high-speed and \"regular\" memory cards.

So when i saw the S2 i thought it was the rigth one. In order to be sure I checked amazon reviews and dpreview.com and then it was very clear.I bought this camera in July 2005 as a replace for my Kodak DX6490 (4 Mp, 10X Optical zoom) who was death by that time. The difference is huge! The Canon S2 specs and behaviour is fantastic: 5 Mp, 12X Optical Zoom with Stabilization, vari-angle display (you don't know how necessary it is until you have it), fast shooting, multiple auto modes and manual modes, feels good in the hand, Canon optics that you can see in awesome pictures and all the professional modes in case you want to go beyond with your photos.I'm very happy with this camera, the zoom is excellent and the image stabilization works very well, of course at the end of the zoom in low ligth conditions it is better to have a good hand or use a tripod.The image quality is very good, the best i've had from a digital (please note that i haven't tried a digital SLR), sure my 35 film Canon EOS 300 is more \"pro\" but... i don't carry it often because of the size.There is the new Canon S3 (6 Mp) but i think the jump it's not as big as the one Canon did from S1 to S2 so i'd rather keep the S2 and even if you are thinking on a new camera, the price difference says \"Get the S2\".Now, it's been almost a year since a bougth it and nowadays you can find a lot of cameras with more Mps but... if the zoom and the value are important for you the S2 is the rigth one.", "Date": "August 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot S2 IS", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2GV6HV7O96C71", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am still learning how to use the many features of this camera, but I love it!

First off, the 12x optical zoom is more than enough for most shots, and when it isn't, you can go to 48x with digital zoom.  On most cameras, digital zoom is useless unless you want ugly, pixilated images, but the digital zoom on this camera, although still digital zoom, sometimes turns out fairly clear, but still not quite full quality.Another great feature is the video recorder.  The video quality is very high for a still camera.  I've used it for several video projects.  The only problem is that it uses up memory quickly.  I get about 4 min of video on a 512 card, which is ok for short clips, but not good if you want to record something for very long.The stitch feature is also very useful for larger shots.  There are many settings to play around with, and the manual helps to understand the different settings.It takes AA batteries, which means if you're out shooting and you run out of batteries, just stop at the nearest store and pick up 4 more batteries, and you're ready to go again, without having to wait for a charger.While this is a great camera, it isn't perfect.  First, the auto focus sometimes doesn't focus well, and the manual focus can be slow.  This is especially true at night.  Another major drawback is that it is relatively large.  While this might not be a problem in some cases, it becomes inconvenient when you are someplace like a formal event, where it is good to have a camera that you can just slip into a pocket.  I also don't like the software that comes with the camera, but I haven't found standard software that I have liked.  The only thing it is good for is for stitching pictures together.Although there are some drawbacks to this camera, it is still a great product.  I am very pleased with it, and have gotten good results.  If you're an amateur photographer looking for a quality camera that will take quality photos, and not empty you're wallet, I would highly recommend this camera.

Scarano", "ReviewID": "R3QOE6JZM1LWQQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera tries to do too much, and therefore does nothing well. Unless you're really excited about the 12x zoom and don't need high-quality images, it is better to either spend less money on a more compact camera that will offer the same image quality, or spend more money for a digital SLR. I bought this because the features sounded really good, but I was so disappointed in the image quality that I will return it.The first problem is color noise -- those are the multi-colored speckles you see on otherwise smooth surfaces, especially in darker areas of the image. From what I can tell, all digicams under $500 (i.e., non-SLRs) produce noticable color noise. Because the S2 makes no attempt to be compact or cheap, and because I read positive reviews, I thought it would do well in the noise department. However, this thing produces images that usually have *more* noise than my older, cheaper, smaller Powershot A60!Another is that the autofocus does not work very well, which makes the 12x zoom much less useful than you might expect. Many of my AF zoom shots were poorly focused.Before buying this, you should also keep in mind that the image stabilization is only useful for zoom shots. (That is the nature of IS, not a shortcoming of the camera.) For normal & wide-angle shots, you're still going to get blurrier images than you would expect from a 35mm camera. That's because the low sensitivity of the image sensor requires it to use slower shutter speeds and a wider aperture.To be exact, you'll be taking pictures with a sensitivity equivalent to 50-speed film (ISO 50). If you tweak the setting, this camera will let you go up to ISO 400, but the color noise is unbearable on anything above ISO 100.The video feature is really cool, I must admit. The resolution and frame rate are as high as you could ask, as long as your memory card is large enough. But remember that the quality will still be low, because the noise problem is more pronounced in movies than stills.If you just want lots of features and don't mind the bulk, buy it. If you want to take high-quality pictures, and can spend a little more money, look at low end SLRs, like the Pentax *ist DL.", "Date": "April 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "I LOVE THIS CAMERA", "Author": "PaJoe", "ReviewID": "R1YN9LCJB10XYT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't go into the technical aspects of this camera as I am still learning them, but other reviewers have and I agree with all that I've read and experienced with my own camera.

This camera works easily, so far the manual appears to be easy to understand and the pictures I've taken look great. In fact, one photo in particular was so good I decided to enter it in a contest. The Amazon price ($395 in my gold box) was the best anywhere. No tax and no shipping. The 5 megapixel with the zoom lens is really cool. I took a picture of a horse drawn carriage at a distance of about 75 feet, opened the photo with my computer and zoomed in on the horse.

I would definetly recommend reading the manual thoroughly before taking too many pictures because you may need to change settings to get the best picture possible.  I was suprised when we first got the camera because it seemed to be larger in the picture, however, the size is very comfortable to hold and is nice for traveling and hiking becasue it is lightweight.  I would definetly recommend getting a 1 GB card so that you can take as many pictures as you want.  The zoom features are great on this camera.  I would recommend a tripod for 48x zooms because it is nearly impossible to hold the camera still enough to get a clear picture.  Also, you can take a picture, and then zoom into the picture.  This was kind of neat because we took a picture of something moving from a long way off and where then able to zoom in on it a find out what it was (a buffalo- we were at Yellowstone.)  Almost makes binoculars obsolete!  We took a short movie with the camera too (takes up loads of space on the sd card) and took 60 rapid sucession photos of Old Faithful.

This camera takes incredible pictures, see the samples on this page.  Most of my pictures at 12x zoom have been perfect due to the IS function.  The menus are much easier to use than the Olympus.I do have 1 complaint as I tend to hit the shortcut button (which defaults for some reason to change resolution) sometimes when using the camera and have on a couple occasions accidentally lowered the resolution of the pictures until I noticed it.  Change the shortcut key to something more useful and less likely to mess up your pictures if you press it by mistake.The videos are good enough to play on a big screen TV although the wind noise sometimes makes it through the filter.  Also with my hand, the video image still moves around alot at 12x zoom.  Another nice feature of the video is you can zoom while you shoot and I haven't noticed any noise from the zoom motor in the video.  The stereo mics also work amazingly well considering they are so close together.  The videos do chew up memory quickly but as has been stated, a 1 G card will hold 8 minutes and that is alot of video.  I have never had the buffer run out even on normal (not high speed) cards although I haven't tried an 8 minute video either.Update - After 15 months it is now at the Canon Repair Center for a $120 repair.  That is the standard cost to repair the camera unless you damaged it.  A few months ago it started sometimes having a black screen.  I assumed it was some power save mode until it got worse.  In the end, it would take one picture at most and then go black and have to have the power cycled.  If your S2 goes to a black screen after a photo is taken, if it is still under waranty send it in ASAP.  I still recommend the camera as it takes great pictures, uses AA batteries (the NiMH ones last a very long time) and has easy to use menus.Update 2: A quick web search shows this problem is common to many camera brands due to faulty Sony CCD.

When the camera first came out in 2005 or 2006, the camera had a suggested retail price at the time of around seven-hundred bucks but with an expected street price of around five-hundred dollars at the time years ago. It is now 2010 and I got lucky by getting the camera in good almost perfect condition, albeit as a used camera, for sixty-five bucks + S&H.;  The person who sold the camera bought a newer camera and therefore no longer wanted this Canon Powershot S2 IS camera.  And so I was lucky to get the camera for the cheap price.  And the camera came in the original box with the manuals etc.  But as you can see here on Amazon, the price may actually vary for this particular camera whether as a new or used camera.  The Canon Powershot S2 IS that I bought works fine.  There are little scuffs and scratches on the surface casing, but you wouldn't notice those superficial flaws unless if you were looking.  Nonetheless, I'll probably get a gray/silver permanent marker (or sharpie) to cover up at least the scuffs. Not a big deal, because that can be considered normal wear and tear for a pre-owned (used) camera.  Otherwise, taking snapshots works fine, the continuous picture-taking function also works, making video works, the optical zoom works, and the image stabilization appears to work. Fortunately, as a used camera, I got lucky with this particular Canon Powershot S2 IS camera because it was well taken care of.  Wonderful.There are a few things that I've read about in the discussions here on Amazon that are of some concern.  Specifically, there are three potential issues with this camera that people have complained about:The first issue is the lens cap.  The lens cap falls off.  The way around that is to insert a little bit of the lens cap's strap under the cap as you put the cap on the lens.  That makes for a tight fit with the cap not falling off.  When you turn on the camera to take pictures, the cap is easily pushed off without any strain on the extending lens turret.  Easy fix.  See the video that I'm posting with this review.The second issue is the so-called black-screen-of-death.  I haven't encountered that problem yet because the camera that I bought was in good condition.  But it is a potential concern.  After researching this problem, the so-called black-screen-of-death is apparently a shutter problem and not a lens CCD sensor problem.  What apparently happens is that when the weather gets really hot, and particularly if you haven't used the camera for a while after that, the oil in the shutter assembly expands and subsequently hardens, and then all of that results in oil gunk that gets in the way of the shutter causing the shutter to not open.  Therefore, you have the black-screen-of-death when trying to take pictures.  A solution for this problem is the following taken from a Flickr group discussion (from someone whose username is \"dblthisyear\"):-{QUOTE}- \"Set the camera in TV mode, (delayed shutter mode) set the shutter at 15 sec, click to take a picture and during that 15 secs (like, after 7 seconds) open the battery compartment which cuts contact with the battery circuit.  Close the battery cover.  At this point the camera works fine ... but only temporarily.... Here is the key to the permanent fix.  While the camera is working via the temporary fix, take many, many pictures.  Hundreds!  I probably snapped 400-600 pics.  The idea is to wear down the little patches of hardened oil on the shutter blades.  For the next three days I took hundreds of pics each day.  Basically, I just aimed the camera at the wall or whatever and snapped off several hundred pics.\" -{UNQUOTE}-If this problem happens to me, I would probably do the fix and take a lot of pictures until the battery goes out and consider it fixed.  But the idea is to keep the camera in use to keep the shutter working.  In other words, don't just let the camera sit in storage for a really long time and not expect this problem to happen. Or put another way: Use the camera and don't just let it sit there.The third issue is the E18 Error problem where the lens turret either does not retract or does not extent outwards when you take pictures.  I haven't encountered this problem and hopefully won't ever have this problem.  Nonetheless, if this problem were to occur, there are a few solutions suggested by the E18 Error website.  Turn off the camera and try these solutions.  One solution is to change the batteries to new batteries but wait a few minutes after taking out the old batteries before putting in the new batteries.  Another possible solution is to use compressed air to blow out all the dust and sand out from all around the turret that may have somehow gotten into between the lens' turret and the camera body.  Another possible solution is to tap the side of the camera (the side that has the padded USB cover part) on a hard surface (e.g., a desk) to shake up and loosen whatever is holding the turret in place.  I would probably just pound the side of the camera against my hand.  Yet another possible solution is to \"force\" the camera lens' turret to click the turret back into place.  Look around the turret to see where there may be a large gap compared to elsewhere around the turret, and then gently move the lens around in a circular motion until you hear a click when it pops back into place.After I read about these problems and found these do-it-yourself solutions, I felt safe in buying this Canon Powershot S2 IS camera as a used camera that was no longer under warranty.So far, knock on wood, I've been happy with this Canon Powershot S2 IS camera.  I could have bought the latest new simple point-and-shoot digital camera with more megapixels for a little bit more than what I paid for this camera.  However, this camera's five megapixels are more than enough I would think because I've found the resulting digital picture can be huge, detailed, and sharp.  And so I was happy to select this camera which is more like a real camera with more capabilities including a real 12x optical zoom - while paying a cheap price.  This camera is a bit heavy and so you do need a neck strap with this camera to hang the camera around your neck.  The neck strap was included with the camera.  A wrist strap would not have been enough.  If you decide to get this camera, keep in mind that it can only take SD memory cards and not the newer SD HC (SDHC) memory cards.  The biggest SD cards that seem to be available are the two gigabyte SD cards.  I found what appear to be four gigabyte SD cards being sold here on Amazon by third-party sellers, but, after reading comments for those cards, I think those cards are really SDHC cards.  Also, if you want to do videos with this camera, the files are .AVI files and you can shoot up to a one-gigabyte continuous video which is approximately 7-8 minutes.  If you want to make a longer video using this camera, then you'll have to shoot your video in segments and edit them together.  A software CD came with this camera, but I'm using iMovie on my Macbook to edit video.And so this Canon Powershot S2 IS camera is a good camera to consider.  I also have a Canon Powershot A60 camera and so this Canon Powershot S2 IS camera would be like an upgrade - although I'll most likely use both for taking still picture shots.  And I have a Flip UltraHD Camcorder, but although the video on the Canon Powershot S2 IS is only standard definition, the zoom on the Canon Powershot S2 IS is a real optical zoom when compared to the Flip's puny digital zoom.  So for video, I'll probably use both the Canon Powershot S2 IS and the Flip together. And so, all of the cameras will go in the same camera bag.

I am completely satisfied.  For the price, this camera is the ultimate package.  Although it's such a good camera, there are a few things that I don't like.  First off, Canon's lens is completely unique to Canon.  The lens cap is shabby at best.  It only slips over the lens, which scares me because it leaves the lens vulnerable to scratching.  The other thing that I did not like about the camera is that it does not have a specific sports setting in the dial.  On the other hand, this camera can become completely manual, including a manual focus.  I feel that it's a fair trade-off.  I read in another review that this camera eats batteries.  The remedy for this is to turn the power saving feature on, and to buy some rechargable batteries.

I have had this camera for 6 months now, and have loved it every sense I have gotten it.First about taking pictures.  This is my first digital camera even though I have used other digital cameras before.  I think it as easy to use as any camera out their.  The pictures are easy to take and the camera has plenty of settings for me to use.  I have hardly used anything besides auto, portrait, and landscape.  All have given me better then I expected quality prints.  The menus are easy to navigate; I hardly change any of the settings because it takes so great of pictures.  I have started to use the features of where you can record sound to a picture, more to explain what the picture is.  This works fairly well, but the audio is put into a different folder so when you put the pictures onto your computer they aren't tied together at all.When I was reading reviews of this camera, some people said they had problems with red eye.  This did worry me because one of the main reasons I was getting this camera was to take pictures of people.  I can say now that out of some 100 or so pictures that I have taken of people (just straight on mug shots so to speak) I have had only about 2 -5 red eye problems.  Most of them were so small that I hardly noticed it until I saw it on my computer, and then just removed it with any digital picture program.  The Flash is a little on the weak side, but you only notice that if you are standing back probably more then  6ft.  Also people have said this camera doesn't focus good?  I'm not sure what they are talking about.  I have only had maybe 2 times when the camera took a while to get the focus right.  (By the way you can't even hear the lenses move in and out, it is so quick and quite it is amazing to me.)Next about videos with this camera sense that is what one review was wondering about.1) How much memory does it require to get about an hour of video?This camera isn't made to replace your video camera.  From what I have heard you can take 8 mins on a 1GB card (giver or take a minute.)  That doesn't sound like a lot, and maybe you can get more on a 2gb card I'm not really sure.  The most video I have taken is like 5 mins, and that was all I really needed.  Just a couple of video shots here and there.2) Is there any special equipment or software, not provided, that is needed to covert the recording to a DVD for viewing?If you have a video burning program then you should be fine.  The videos are put into AVI format and most of the time I have been able to just open the files in my burning program.  I do know Canon provided some video editing program but I don't think that burns it to DVD but I could be wrong.3) Can you edit the video? How?Yes, you can edit the video either in Canon's program that comes with the camera (I haven't tried this program out so I don't know how good it is).  Or just use any other video editing program.  I have used Adobe Premier Elements and it has worked perfectly.4) Can the conversion be done on any PC and/or any film processing service?I'm not sure what this question is asking.  Converting video?  I think converting it between formants is easy.5) How long does this take?To convert?  I don't know, I guess it would depend on how much footage you have?4) How is the quality? Indoors? Outdoors? Sports/action shots?The quality of the video is great!  We bought a digital video camera (from Canon) just two years ago and my PowerShot S2 takes better video.  The quality and sound are as good or better then digital video cameras that I have seen.The only two downsides I have to the camera is:1. The view screen on the back is a little smaller then I would have liked.  The main reason it is so small is because it can swivel out and turn around and so forth.  I wish it was a little bigger, but actually having the view screen swivel like it does makes it easy to shoot video, and get some pretty crazy angles for pictures.2. Every so often when the batteries start to get low, I turn the camera on I guess two quickly or something and it well say I need to change the batteries.  I wait a couple of seconds turn the camera on and it does just fine.  Just ever so often I get that that message that I need to change my batters when I still have some juice lefts in them.  I have only gotten 3 times in the 6 months I have had it.This is a great camera, it isn't like your small compact point and shoot, but for anybody that wants a full range of features pulse be able to take some great video then you need to get this camera.

But for the Amazon price and the features it is a great camera. The S2 I bought from Amazon said \"Made in Japan\" which makes it extra nice as usually the engineering is better. So even though I love the camera and its many features, my only complaint is that I have not been able to use it as much as my earlier Canon A95 due to it's size. Earlier I used to slip my camera in my pocket even when walking the dog as you never knew when you got a good photo opportunity. And my older cameras always fitted into my handbag so I was never without a camera. Now after upgrading to the S2, I have to carry it in a separate case, so I have not been able to capture everyday moments at work, on the road and flip it out at parties from my tiny purse. Earlier I used to take almost 60-70 shots a week and now it's just during some weekends or vacations. For instance, carrying the S2 on a date seems rather \"geeky\" and you can never carry it unobstrusively. So even though I love the versatility of the S2 I'll have to spend another $300+ to buy the digital elph.

I did not dish out for a DSLR because I knew I would get the camera jones and start buying all the extra stuff like i did with the S2 IS.If you are dissappointed with the AUTO mode pics you're getting, please practice with the more manual settings---you won't be dissappointed.  (Set AF mode to SINGLE, and IS Mode to SHOOT ONLY) In good lighting, esp outdoors on a sunny day, it is hard to beat the S2 in it's class now.  Using an add on lens adapter with a quality linear polarizer and you will get some WOW! pics, esp if you are going on vacation (for accessories, try lensmateonline dot com).Low light situations CAN be it's achilles heel.  I say can because if you learn some of the manual settings you can take some pretty good indoor shots as long as you are resigned to using the flash (other wise you will need to go the DSLR route).  Also ISO 200 can be acceptable, but use 400 only if there is no other way to get the shot---you can clean it up with some postprocessing later on your comp.Indoor Tip#1:  Use the Night Snapshot mode in the Scenes setting.  Turn down exposure compensation to -2/3, and you will get a better indoor flash  photo that doesn't result in a dark background.Indoor Tip#2:  Using AV mode with aperture set to 5.0 (4.0 to 5.6 is the sweet spot for the S2),go into the settings menu and set Flash Sync to '2nd curtain', and Slow Synchro to 'On'.  Set ISO to 100, exposure compensation between -2/3 to  -2.  Using the flash and a steady hand, this results in slower shutter times, but for indoor poses and 'portrait' type shots, it blows away just using the flash regularly.  Backgrounds won't be dark, and your subjects won't be so washed out.Bottom line, if you prefer black, want an extra megapixel, can spend the extra dough get the S3, but right now it's difficult to recommend it due to the price the S2 is going for now.", "Date": "January 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "I Love This Camera", "Author": "Amy Lynn", "ReviewID": "R15M20DXYI4X9K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, let me start by saying this is the first digital camera ive purchased.

There are many different features and buttons on this camera as well as small but thick directions and manuals that came with the product. I read through all the directions and features and within a day or two I got the hang of it. It looks more challenging to use than it is... Yet.. ive had this camera for 2-3 weeks now or longer and im still finding out new and unique features on the camera.. The possibilities feel endless. This thing has it all. Zoombrowser, editing movies, replaying movies, merging panoramic images, flash sync, red eye correction, landscape mode, portrait, every feature you can think of basically. It comes with software to install on your computer which is very easy to do. This software allows you to store your photos on the computer and you can change the brightness, tint color and red eye correction. The picture quality is excellent and its a lot of fun to take pictures with this. I find myself more interested in taking photos just because of the quality and fun I get out of using this camera. Its a very unique looking camera yet handsome. The only issue I have with this camera is the batteries die quickly. It requires 4 AA batteries and if you use it a lot like I do they will need replacing or a battery charger and If youve never used a digital camera you might have a little trouble with this in the beginning because it has so many features and buttons.. but, if youre willing to learn and are interested in photography and playing around with it a little I'd say get it.

The only two complaints are - flash recycling time should have been lesser, and the SD card that comes with it is only 16 MB, which is hardly enough for 7-8 pics. You will have to buy a 1 GB or 2 GB SD card separately. Also, the batteries that come with it are not rechargeable, so you will have to buy charger and batteries as well, which are not so expensive.

My background is professional photography, so I am more used to a camera that I can set manually when desired to obtain motion blur, depth of field, timed exposures, intentional over or under exposure, etc.  My wife made the venture into digital a few years ago, and has been using a 1.3 mp camera, which was okay, but not as fancy.  We got the Canon to give her more mp, and some extra features.  We've only had it a month, and haven't learned a lot of what it can do, but compared to digital cameras owned by other family members and traveling friends, this Canon seems to give sharper, more well exposed pictures on automatic than most of the others.  I think the IS (Image Stabilization) works well, since I'm a little shaky, but the pictures always seem sharp.  One feature I think they missed on though is being able to use a manual fill flash with the automatic setting.  Won't work.  You have to go to one of the programmed or manual settings to be able to use manual fill flash.  Another thing is that the flash doesn't pop up automatically when you need it, even on \"automatic\" mode.  You have to raise it manually.  Then, if flash is needed, it will go off.", "Date": "July 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "excellent time to buy s2", "Author": "Adam \"Adam\"", "ReviewID": "R2P6U7K1OWU1TH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought I'd mention that with the recent introduction of the Canon s3 is, the s2 has fallen about $100 in price.

As a result, I made up my mind on how much I wanted to spend and what features I expected to get for my money. I wanted to have a camera with at least 5 mp, it had to have good optical zoom, it had to be fast.After long and exhausting research and experiments, I decided Canon S2 was meeting all my needs.I did not have the time to explore all features Canon S2 offers, but so far I'm impressed.Although this camera is larger than any point-and-shoot camera, it is extremely comfortable. If you don't feel like experimenting with manual features, you can leave the camera in auto mode and it will do really nice pictures.So far I did not need to use the LCD. In this camera a viewfinder performs as LCD. The viewfinder on this camera is not a simple hole with glass. It catches the image through the lense; therefore there is no need to use LCD. This way in bad conditions you can keep the LCD closed. By the way this is the only camera  that allows you to keep the LCD closed. You can also rotate the LCD to various angles. Keeping the LCD closed  saves the batteries.Long lasting batteries is another great feature of this camera. So far every camera I used consumed batteries like crazy. I mean I had to replace or recharge batteries after only 80-200 shots. So far I took around 200 pictures with this Canon with one set of batteries. The batteries are still good. I wonder how many more pictures I will take before the first set of batteries die.I did not explore many features on this camera yet. I photographed in Auto, Landscape, and Portrait mode. I got excellent quality portrait photos, great landscape photos. This camera performs extremely well in auto mode.I will add to this review as I experiment more with various modes.

I told Norris, the supervisor, that I'm really upset with Canon's unwillingness to back up their products and charging me $130 for repair of my 20-month-old $500 camera.

I had been hoping to save enough for a digital SLR sometime later in 2007.  But, reading the specs, info, & reviews for the S2IS convinced me that this is a serious camera with all the capability I would want and more, all at a fraction of the cost of even a low-end digital SLR.  I like to take pictures, and good ones, but do not consider myself an accomplished photographer.  But this little marvel has already opened the door to more photographic possibilities than I ever had with my old all-manual SLR.  The 5mp resolution is more than adequate for my purposes.  More might be better for a serious photographer, and I think succeeding generations of this one will offer more.  But for me this is quite enough.  And the lens is incredible.  Think of this:  a 12x crystal clear optical zoom -- In 35mm equivalent, that's a max focal length of 432 mm!  I shoot lots of wildlife.  The S2IS allows me to get really close without overly disturbing the subject.  Plus it has great macro capability.  Plus, if you want to customize (And who doesn't -- there is no \"one size fits all\" when it comes to photographic situations; auto just can't do everything every time), the S2IS offers compensation for all kinds of lighting conditions, manual settings for ISO, shutter speed, aperture, focus, light metering, and more.  I still haven't begun to explore the possibilities.  Yet, for the novice, this camera is a snap to use.  The image stabilization feature really works, even at slow shutter speeds.  This is the first digital camera I have owned; actually it is the first automatic camera of any kind I have used.  I have had it for about a month, and so far the images are spectacular.  Plus, it's digital.  I can shoot away & experiment all I want.  In one small, affordable, incredibly engineered package, the S2IS is everything I have been looking for in a camera, and more.

Couldn't justify the differences (from my research) to put out the extra $ for the S3. At first didn't really like the quality of pictures we were getting with it. Plus the size was a bit big and heavy for everyday use so we were planning on returning it. I was also a bit intimidated by all the functions that I did not know how to use. Started looking and researching another, smaller camera, simpler functions. Wanted to stay with the A series Canon because they use AA batteries and SD card. Researched (and researched and researched!!) and it came down to the A630 and the A710IS, both of which are very good cameras. Finally decided on A710IS mainly because of the IS. After playing with and reading up on how to use some of the features on the A710 I realized Auto is not the best mode and have actually learned some of the functions of the manual controls (only way to go, IMO) and am extremely pleased with that camera. Had not returned the S2 yet and got it back out of the box. Tried again to use some of the functions (much less intimidated but I still have much to learn) and got great results!! I am loving this camera, loving the zoom and the few extra features it has over the 710 and have decided to keep both cameras (A710 and the S2)for the versatility. This way we have a nice small, compact camera to take to events where a larger camera might not be as convenient. With the S2 we have the longer zoom, swivel screen and a few other different features.

It's June 4th, 2013, in a time of Canon T5i DSLR's and yes I'm reviewing this 5mp camera with 5-stars! Now on with my review...I was totally blown away with this camera.  Price wise I have to be honest, I picked my Powershot S2 IS at the Salvation Army thrift store for 2-dollars.  It was thrown in with the rest of the 35-mm point and shoot crap cameras that sat in this box for months.  I mean who wants to buy an old school 35mm point and shoot nowdays in the realm of cameras like my 16mp Olympus Bridge Camera or my Canon T3 DSLR?But this little gem sat with all the analog cameras.  I saw it, picked it up and asked how much?  $2 was their offer.  I bought it, put the four AA batteries in it and loaded it up with a 16gb SDHC card and to my disappointment, it said, \"Memory Card locked\"  it wasn't and this blue LED warning light stayed on even as I turned the camera off.  No wonder someone donated this camera.  So it sat in my garage work bench for about a year until I discovered it again and decided to do some research on this little lost gem.Found out the blue light and the Memory Locked message were related and the warning was telling me I was using an SD card bigger than 2gb.  That's all this camera can take.  I rummaged thru my utility drawer (everyone has one)and found an old 1gb SD card I no longer used and was destined for the trash.  Popped it in along with another set of AA batteries and Voila!! Blue light gone, message disappeared!Now to the review...WOW!  I am amazed at this little gem!  Originally priced at $499 when first introduced years ago, it packs quite a bit of power for the price.  Now let's not get all excited about 5mp resolution, but do remember at 5mp there is lower digital noise when pushing to its ISO 400 range.  So when comparing to my 12mp Canon T3 the results were about the same in both outdoors and flash photography! How can that be?  5mp means bigger pixels per sq centimeter so you can blow these images up to 8x10 with surprisingly good results!Ultrasonic AF motor = quiet focusing as opposed to mechanical motors that whine and whizz as it auto focuses.  This camera has a USM (Ultrasonic Motor) so it's quiet.  Great for those sleeping pet photos or up close bird shots.Image Stabilization = Little to no blurriness when zoomed out to max telephoto.AV, TV, M modes = Total control over action, portrait and long exposure shots.  Use AV and manually set the aperture to the largest opening to give you a shallow depth of field (makes back and foregrounds blurry while keeping subject razor sharp in focus)  TV mode lets you select the shutter speed and control action shots in low light levels while the camera selects aperture size.  M for manual for those long exposure, moon and Milky Way Galaxy shots on a tripod.  Plus a host of other user defined and programmed modes including the fail-safe Full Auto mode which allows you to use the Powershot S2 IS like a digital point and shoot for those frantic shooting modes like kids birthday parties.  This is a versatile digital Bridge Camera.Summary:  Even at 5mp this camera will give you great 8x10 photos.  Lots of modes to keep you busy with your creativity.  Full Auto mode if you're not ready to experiment.  Uses 4-AA batteries, I use Lithium Ion batteries so absolutely no problems.

I bought this camera in March of 2007 for about $400. It can take great pics, decent video & the ability to take a picture while recording is a neat feature (although the odds of getting a clear picture are 50/50). The hesitation between shots is annoying & that was my biggest peeve of the camera. I lost countless shots due to the lag (shutter lag? not sure of the technical term for it). For the amount paid for the camera, that lag was a major disappointment. This camera also uses standard AA batteries & goes through them quickly. Using lithium helps extend the usage time, but rechargeable would probably be the best option. Still, overall, the camera was doing well...until the dreaded E18 error(lens error) last November. Camera wasn't dropped, actually, I had just taken a picture, was waiting on the lag to shoot the next pic when the camera beeped at me, gave the E18 error & the lens would not retract.

This spring (2009), one of the fellow purchasers reported that her LCD was blank when she tried to take a photo.  I did some research for her online and found the problem with the Canon S1 (the predecessor to this one) which had glue let go that connected the CCD to the connector. Canon acknowledged the problem with the S1 and did a recall.  Some of the early S2's apparently had the same bad lot of Sony CCDs and my friend's camera was one of the bad ones.  She talked to Canon Customer Service and got the standard line that she could send it in and it would cost upwards of $150 to fix the camera.  She had been very happy with the photos she took with the camera and wanted it fixed but I counselled her to stick for Canon repairing it for free!  She ended up writing a letter to the Canon CEO with the details, her love of the camera and disappointment in what Canon was offering.  The upshot is that she had Canon peppering her with phone calls and they fixed the camera better than new!  She is very happy - no cost to her - not even shipping!So to those of you with this problem, do what she did.  A little research, some kind words about Canon, and a request for them to do the right thing.  It worked for my friend and it should work for you.  Perhaps Canon will just do a blanket order to fix this at any time as a result.BTW I have taken thousands and thousands of photos with this camera and I just love it.

I learned a lot from your review.**deleted review content - outdated tech, read below**update Mar, 7, 2010This thing drains batteries even when not in use & I was finding that I had to have recharged or new batteries ready every couple of days. I was also having problems with it not taking good photos in a lower light setting. The shots are VERY noisy - think a grainy film photo - especially when the batteries begin to run down, even with the amazing Sanyo Eneloops. While I have improved my skills using this camera and have been able to get some very good shots with it, I outgrew it quickly and the limitations I began to discover within the first couple of months convinced me I needed a major upgrade. I now am the proud owner of a Nikon D90 - and what a camera it is!! I would strongly recommend buying a newer version of the Powershot S series if the buyer wants to stay with the 'all in one' set up you get with them. (Nikon's Coolpix version is also very good) I had considered one thinking I would never be able to afford the Nikon, but we had a good tax return this year :) I realized I wanted to do more with photography than one of these cameras would allow. Basically, it's a good enough camera with a few shortcomings, but it's from 2005 & considering how fast technology is outdated these days, you'd be better off going with a newer model.

I use my camera mostly for macro nature photography and everyday around the house photos. Most of the time I use automatic settings and come out with decent results. I've been wanting a better telephoto lens for birding. This is what I was comparing the Canon S2 IS against when I took it out for a test drive this weekend. I will be returning the S2 - it wasn't worth it as an upgrade to me.There are a few design features that I did not like. The S2 uses the LCD to show what features are enabled. I prefer how the G3 has two seperate screens - one as a view finder and one for displaying settings. That way, if the LCD is closed, I can still see what settings I have selected. The eyepiece viewfinder is digital, not optical. When I'm zoomed in all the way, I will use it to track an animal, where I can see more of the scene, but the S2 eyepiece displays the same picture as the LCD, and when zoomed in all the way it was too blurry to see anything.I loved the image stabilization and the telephoto lens. I was able to stand in my house and get decent photos of squirrels and birds in trees outside. I could get clear basketball players at dusk from a distance. The colors did not seem as rich as my other camera, but the image quality for normal shots seemed just as good. The camera focuses quickly and the pictures are quick.The macro lens is what I was very disappointed about. It's true that you can get a photo with the lens directly on the object - I got a shot of the newspaper with the lens touching, but no animal or insect is going to let me get that close for a photo anyway. The part I disliked the most with the macro is that you cannot zoom in that mode. Usually I get as close as I can physically and then zoom in, but not with the S2.Personally, I still want a camera that can do a telephoto zoom as well as this one, but not lose the macro capabilities I have with my G3.

Sometimes the camera focuses on the tree behind the two people I'm trying to photograph.

Some people look at this as a minus because it makes the camera heavier. My last camera has a LI battery and I though I would miss it but I don't. Pick up some rechargeable AA's from Amazon for less than $20 and your all set. The extra weight is really nothing significant and if you run out of power while shooting you can pop in a couple AA's and your up and running again. Much cheaper than buying an additional LI battery.-Super Macro mode is great for taking clear up-close photos. I have some great shots of bugs and flowers I've taken with this.-Video and sound are surprisingly good.-There are some neat shooting modes that are easily accessible, my favorites are under the Color's(not sure if that's right) wheel option. There are some options that allow you to have certain colors stand out in your pictures. For example when shooting a sunny day and I want a deep blue sky, sometime I will switch over and tell the camera I want to make blue stand out. There are some preset colors but you can also point with the camera and choose your own. The other neat option is the ability to only shoot a single color and make everything else black and white.-Pictures are beautiful and sharp. I love the closeups I can get of peoples faces.-Manual mode allows the user a bit more freedom with this camera than most Point and shoots. I rarely use Auto-Mode, but if you need it, the pictures Auto takes are usually great.-Good logical step for people looking to move from the Point and Shoot world that are aren't ready for a DSLR but would like to learn more about photography and possibly move to a DSLR at some point in time.Cons:-Only goes to ISO 400 and trust me it's not pretty. This camera excels in taking pictures during the day, not really in low light hand-held conditions or at night using the flash. If you've got a tripod the pictures can still be great in low light, but bumping the ISO to 200, or 400 gives the pictures way to much noise for me.-Flash is good but sometimes a bit too much. You can adjust the flash to three settings in manual mode (low, med, high) but I just really don't like this cameras flash much. It blows out faces a little and makes them a bit whiter than I would like. I still use it...but I wish the camera took better pictures indoors without a flash.-Small LCD. May be a big deal for people that have trouble seeing small objects. I don't mind it , but I have pretty good eyes. This LCD is impossible to see in the Sun so I find myself looking through the viewfinder a lot more than using the LCD.-Manual focus is pretty tough. Don't try manually focusing through the LCD, you can't see what your doing, it's way too pixelated. I only look through the viewfinder when manually focusing and even then it's difficult because the electronic screen has a fairly low resolution. I do use manual focus when taking Macro photography and it does work pretty well but for other conditions I let the camera auto-focus, it's too much of a pain to manually focus every shot with this camera. The button placement for the MF is poor as well.-Size may or may not matter to you. This is not a Small P&S; that will slide in your pocket but it's also not a DSLR. I don't mind the size at all but some of you may. Go hold one in the store before buying it to see if the size is too big for you.-Lens is not interchangeable although there are some adapters to fit a wide angle lens that I've seen.If your looking at this camera you are probably also looking at the S3 and the S5. The big things the S3 has going for it are the extra mega pixels, the gun-metal look, larger LCD, and a couple of in-camera features you may or may not use. I haven't researched the S5 much, but it's $100+ more.You can't go wrong with either of the three but if you're on a budget stick with the S2 or S3. The S1 is a good camera too, but the MP are even lower, I personally would stay away from it with. The S2 and S3 are almost identical, I've used both and the pictures you are going to get out of either are the basically identical. If the extra MP and larger LCD are worth it to you than go with the S3, otherwise save some money and go with this camera and I promise you will not be disappointed.", "Date": "November 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "best bang for the buck", "Author": "G.

The S2is will never grow old. 5MP is enough, and if you are worried about cropping or making 8x10's then worry no more. Just shoot at the highest resolution and your 8x10's will look just as good as your buddy who claims he has a nicer camera because his p&s; has 10MPs.This camera is feature rich, especially since, in todays high end DSLR world, this camera is kind of outdated. I have shot some of my best stuff with this camera. The fully customizable Manual mode is a godsend. Also for those of you who are new to Digital Photography there are plenty of presets ready for you to shoot at until you get your feet wet and decide to start messing around with the Av, Tv, P, and M modes....The 12x optical zoom is amazing. I can shoot in a variety of settings with confidence when I have this baby slung over my neck. Ergonomics are good too, as the camera fits in my hand perfectly and I have never once been close to dropping it. Its not bulky nor is it lightweight and flimsy.This has to be the best value for money digital camera out there right now. High zoom, good Megapixel amount, loaded with customizable features, and a great interface that is easy to use. I highly recomment this camera to those who need a great camera but dont want to spend a thousand bucks on a DSLR. If you can't decide between this and the S3is then let money be the factor....there is not too much of a difference between the two except for MP increase to 6, \"action\" mode, and a few other cool things that shouldn't matter all that much to someone who is interested in these types of cameras anyhow.Well done Canon!", "Date": "June 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Wow - fantastic.", "Author": "Charlie\u2122", "ReviewID": "R3PHM92IGORWBM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I resisted the move to digital for years - carrying an assortment of digital pocket cameras for snaps... and my reliable Canon FTB (circa 1974) for real photography.

The zoom is smooth and fast, and the stability feature is gives me about 2 f-stops better than I deserve.The S3-IS is even nicer, but I dare you to justify the price difference. On top of the simply quality of the results and flexibility of the settings (from fully manual everything to auto-preset-scenes), it takes movies better than many mini-DV cameras I've seen. Sure they're short - and the light weight makes for a less-than-steady-cam presentation, but it's truly incredible.Only drawback - it's too old to support the newest high-capacity SD cards (4GB and up).

The Cannon allowed me to take great pictures of Christmas with my grandkids. I have many wonderful pictures I wouldn't have had without my new camera. I have not explored all the options and modes available on the camera, and doubt if I ever will use them all. My picture taking activities are fairly basic, although with this camera I probably will get more sophisticated. The S2IS makes it so easy to take great photos of people, wildlife and nature scenes.

Upon my recommendation my son-in-law purchased his about 1 month later but from Costco.We both were amazed at the performance of this camera. It was all that we expected and more.About 14 months of use I started to have a strange \"black screen\" at start up. This problem would come and go and at times it would only happen at start up and the camera would perform perfectly for hours of shooting. About two months after my problem started my son -in law's camera also started to exhibit the \"exact\" same problem He had purchased his camera from Costco.As time went on it became apparent that a serious flaw in this camera was starting to creep in and after researching this issue I decided to check with Canon. There service department said that they knew of no serious flaw in the S2 and offered to repair it for $127 since it was out of warranty by 8 months.My son -in-laws cameras also started to go down hill and he also notified Canon and received the same response. Canon's attitude is that this \"black screen\" problem at start up is just one of those product failures that happen with all brands of cameras. I agreed that since there warranty is for one year that any product that fails after that would not be covered unless there \"failure\" rate on a particular model is was above industry levels but to have TWO cameras failing at almost the same time with the EXACT same problem is pretty coincidental. Plus research on the net indicates many of these S2's failing with almost the EXACT same issue \"black screen\" at start up.Before any one buys the Canon S2 they better research the forums and decide if they want to chance buying this camera. I give it 5 stars for performance and 0 stars for reliability. I am sure that there are many S2's that do not have this problem but I also believe that there is an \"abnormally high\" fail rate for this camera.I worked in Aerospace Quality Control for 12 years and it is my guess that the failure rate on this camera is way to high for the price and brand name (Canon).

What I'm going to talk about is durability!I was worried when I bought this camera that it just wouldn't stand up to the abuse I know I was going to put it through.  I'm always outdoors doing something so, knocks, falls, dings, dust, dirt and water seem to always do battle with my electronic \"toys\".

I thought to myself, damn, this thing just reeks beauty which seems to attract extra attention from the elements for some reason.  Not the case with this camera though.I've dropped it once, had it covered in sand and covered in water by a salty wave while deep-sea fishing.  I've even put it to the ultimate test....CHILDREN,,,nooo,nnooo,,Ahhhahhhh!!!!These same children managed to break my Leatherman WAVE tool the first five minuets they possessed the thing; how could a camera possibly survive such grappling, clenching, twisting, clumsy, sticky, dirty hands?  It did though.I know you may think I'm stupid for putting such a nice camera through such treatment but, I'm one that likes to use what I buy right along with how I live.  I'm not a clean freak, stay behind closed doors, air-conditioned type.  I also remember how it used to feel as kid when no one would trust me with a \"cool\", expensive piece of equipment.  It's only a camera and if the kids can feel good by being trusted enough to use it, I'm going to let them use it.After all this wear and tear, the only damage I can see is minor cosmetic damage such as scratches.  The lens is still as clean as a brand-new.  The only problem I had was when the camera locked up one time with the lens sticking out.  No buttons would work and I couldn't get the thing to respond to anything; I began to worry; one of the kids brought it to me in this condition.  After opening the battery housing door and closing it again the camera came back to life and is again in perfectly working order.  I love this camera, after all it's been through it still starts up quickly, uploads quickly, takes beautiful pictures and zooms in and out smoothly.  I'm glad I decided to wait for the S2 rather than settling for the S1 but,..... Yes there's always a but....There is no underwater housing for this camera yet.  If I'd of known this I would have chosen a different camera.  In fact, if Canon does not make an underwater housing I'll never buy Canon again.  That's why I took away a star from it's perfect rating so far.  I've been pestering Canon every day now to build an underwater housing with no luck, can you help????? PLEEEASSEE!So, if your looking for a pretty, powerful camera and don't plan on taking it underwater, this is the camera for you.Good shooting!", "Date": "July 23, 2005"}, {"Title": "Junk - camera with many problems", "Author": "PitDoc", "ReviewID": "RKUG4BWM8E8VB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "LOOK AT THE WEB UNDER \"STUCK SHUTTER,\" \"CCD FAILURE,\" \"E-13 ERROR,\" \"E-18 ERROR,\" \"LENS LOCKED\" AND SO ON.

She considered it broken and got a new one. I sent the camera back to Canon for service and was willing to pay up to $100 to get it fixed. A relatively low investment considering my friend had given me a $480 camera for free. Canon service was excellent! They emailed me that they would fix it for free even though it was out of warranty. I believe that the shutter was stuck closed because I did some research on the Internet and it seemed that that was a somewhat common problem with this model. So if you're having problems with your viewfinder being black and your pictures coming out black, go to Canon before you give up.  Now I have the camera back and it only cost me about $10 in shipping charges. It is a great camera! There are cameras out there with a higher mega pixel count (this one has 5.0), but this is a great camera if you're not going to output large size (8-1/2\" x 11\") photo prints.

It takes excellent photos with vibrant color, and of course the 12x zoom is wonderful.But it has two major flaws. First, the lousy lens cap simply will not stay on. It is a terrible design carried over from the S1 IS that Canon should be ashamed of itself for not fixing. In addition, this camera (and other Canon cameras I have owned) does not perform well (or at all) in low-light situations. My first digital camera was an Olympus C2100 (also a 10x zoom lens), and it took absolutely outstanding low-light photos. Why Canon can't match that much older technology is a mystery to me.

I had never seen this kind of a camera before.  The store had all the packaging and said I had 30 days to return the camera if I didn't like it, and $100 for this camera seemed like a good deal with no risk.Once I put in the batteries and the sd card,  I was blown away just how good the camera was. It was my first EVF viewfinder and it was love at first sight. The camera took marvelous images and it still works perfectly today but it doesn't get used that much because I updated it with the S3is, S5is, SX10is and so on. I later switched to the Panasonic models since they seemed to have surpassed the Canon models although most of the future Canon cameras  are quite good.The first thing I noticed about the camera was the high quality EVF which allowed easy viewing in bright light. It had the added benefit that you can view the image taken without having to take your eye off of the camera. The usual problem with all the compact digital cameras is it's difficult to view a clear image in bright light on the LCD screen. This camera also allowed you to securely hold the camera against your face allowing a much steadier image. The image stabilization is quite good and sharp images were possible in all outdoor lighting. The zoom is a lot of fun and it allows a lot of creativity in my image taking.The camera is not weather sealed and susceptible to the elements including dust and moisture even without raining and could be the source of the shutter problems people were reporting. I never had that problem and even brought the camera to the beach on numerous occasions without any problem.  It never touched the sand or any water and the most important thing,  if there is humidity and there is lots of it here, it's important to not expose the camera to extreme temperature changes to avoid condensation.Overall I gave this camera 5 stars because it was a great discovery and has given me lots of excellent images and made photography fun again.  After using the camera just two weeks, I retired my dSLR but use it  for macro and super high quality images if they are needed.

After a little bit of research I found a site that posted a remedy which actually worked for a time. I'll post it here in the hopes that it may help someone out. What you have to do is set the camera to Tv mode using the dial on top. Tv stands for shutter priority mode. You then go in through the on-screen settings to increase the shutter speed to the maximum amount possible - in my case 15 seconds. You then take a picture, holding your finger on the button (it will take a while), and after about 7-8 seconds you open the battery compartment while the shot is still in progress. This is key. The idea behind opening the battery compartment is it interrupts power to the camera, causing a quick power jolt to the shutter motor in the hopes of making it unstuck. I was incredulous about this at first, but it actually worked, for a time.That was a few months ago. I was able to get a couple more pictures out of it but now I can go through the above procedure 10 times in a row and still no love. I have read that some users had to do it as many as a dozen times in a row before they got the shutter unstuck, but my feeling is that if you're doing that just to get off one picture you're probably better off looking for a new camera.I give this camera 3 stars because for about 6 years it took wonderful pictures, mostly of my kids growing up. It was very easy to use, extremely versatile, and it was a cinch to upload pictures to the computer and edit with the included software. Unfortunately, this stuck-shutter issue really hurt the Canon Powershot S2 IS credibility (and no doubt of Canon itself judging by the number of negative reviews here and elsewhere), and though I may have been luckier than most with this product's longevity, it is very difficult to excuse them for not dealing with a known defect on a $400 camera.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best digital camera", "Author": "Orsolya Simmons \"big reader\"", "ReviewID": "R2JSG7EL5GPFZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera makes Great pictures and videos.

The viewfinder is definitely an asset on sunny bright days taking shots of the family parasailing while being bounced around in the boat or zoomed shots of a school play in a dark auditorium where no flash or noise is permitted.Even though it's a hassle hanging around the neck while walking around, I have never regretted purchasing this camera. In fact, I decided to spring for the $105 estimated charge to get it fixed (over-exposure problem).BTW....I recently bought a Lumix DMC ZS19 for those times when I would like to just walk around with a camera in my packet rather than around my neck.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Black Screen of Death resolved - thank you Canon!", "Author": "Mike T.", "ReviewID": "R2NZ1LJFFLC70G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had used the S2 IS for almost 5 years when one day the Black Screen of Death struck.

Sometimes I want to sit still for a while, manipulate shutter speed and aperture and make a lot of photos. Other times I want to only have to select the ISO and get some shots while they're happening. I can do both with this camera. As you can tell from this site, I'm a fan of the nature close-ups, which this camera handles nicely. In fact, all my photos on this site were taken with this camera! These things together are my favorite features. On the flip side, it does not fit in my pocket, (unless I want to draw attention to myself).

This camera is great. I have probably taken between 1000-1500 pictures with it so far. Here are my impressions:PROS:1. Great zoom lens - the 12x optical zoom (48x with digital zoom) is fantastic. Even at 48x, the photo comes out sharp and not grainy. I attended a pro football game recently, and was sitting at the 2nd highest row in the stadium, yet I took some photos with the zoom that amazed people I showed them to - so much so that they became interested in the camera. Even action shots came out very clear, at a high zoom level. And although I haven't used it much for this purpose yet, except at the zoo - the zoom would be great for wildlife photography too.2. Auto image stabilization - closely related to no. 1 in importance. If the camera did not have this feature, it would be tough to take a clear shot at a high zoom level. With this feature, even 48x photos can be taken clearly without a tripod, as long as you are sitting or bracing against something to hold the camera steady.3. Long battery life - the longest life comes from rechargeable Canon batteries (between 400-500 shots, I think). The ability to accept regular AA batteries is also a plus in my opinion; you can find them anywhere.4. Excellent sharpness and color on photos - again I am not a professional, but to me the pics look awesome, whether they are super macros or long-range zoom photos.5. Nice continuous shooting feature - this camera shoots approx. 2.4 frames/second - a nice feature! At the football game I would focus prior to the snap, then hold the shutter down thru-out the play and I got some amazing shots -- the ball in mid-air after being snapped, and after being thrown by the QB.6. Enough megapixels. Like you probably have, I've read articles saying that for photo quality results with larger than 8x10 photos, you need much more than 5 megapixels. Don't believe it. I printed an 11x14 from this camera, and it came out wonderfully. Then I got curious to see what a 16x20 would look like -- and it looks fantastic too!! I honestly cannot see any degradation in quality at the 16x20 size - this even surprised me! I liked that size so much that I have now gotten others printed for myself and family members.7. Enough features/options for probably any amateur enthusiast - many of which I haven't even used yet!8. Versatility (lens-wise) - to get the same versatility in an SLR, you'd probably have to pay well over $1,000. (probably $2,000 or more for multiple lenses to match what the S2 can do, from super close macros to extra long zoom range..)CONS:1. A little bulky/heavy. But this is a small price to pay for all of the features of this camera.2. I am running out of wall space from all the photos I've printed and framed!Summary - a great camera. If I were in the market now, I'd probably buy the S3IS, just because it has 1 more megapixel and a few additional features, for only a little more money. But if that extra megapixel and few extra features don't matter to you, I'd say buy the S2 - what a deal!

The MPEG4 video function shoots near camcorder quality film and sound. The pictures are excellent. The issue I have is that the auto focus is very picky. I upgraded to this camera from a 3.1MP Power Shot. With that camera, I could auto-focus on any object with the widest angle setting. All I had to do was to turn it on (which would start at the widest angle by default) and press the auto-focus button, it would focus perfectly and I could take the picture. With this camera, it will almost never auto-focus on an object with the widest angle setting. if you want to take a close up picture of an item, you have to stand way back and then zoom in. This is very annoying for several reasons. It takes time, and it is hard to guage the exact righht amount of distance to stand back. It also takes a few times of trial and error each time before it finds a length it will auto-focus on. had I known about this issue beforehand I might not have bought it. I will admit that I am not a shutterbug. I am just a small business owner who needs a lot of pictures taken quickly. This is obviously not the camera for that. Maybe I have too much camera.

My other camera is a Nicon N 6006 with plenty of lenses, zoom, wide angle, etc. and the decision to add a digital was not easy, for I am very happy with my Nicon and the quality of its lenses.The S2 shoots sharp images, has a nice zoom and is very easy and straightforward to use, although sometimes a bit slow in the shooting.  The different shooting modes are very handy, especially for photo stitching.  I'd like to have some higher sensibility for night timte photography without the flash (the flash is good for most of my snapshots, even as a fill flash in sunny conditions at the beach or in the snow).The only down side I foun until now, is that the camera is not very small.  Considering the size, I might as well have gon for an SLR instead (if it wasn't for the price).  I still have lots to learn of this camera until I really use all its potential, but it's looking really good so far.

Truong \"El Duke\"", "ReviewID": "RV0KVMYS99WEP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is perfect for both beginners and more advanced photographers. It is simple to use but has lots of extras and manual settings to play with. The build quality is very good and it has a rugged feel to it overall. I've actually dropped this camera on a few occasions and it still works perfect. I originally bought this camera because it was so highly recommended and highly rated from everyone.  With that said, it is all that I expected it to be. Here are the pros and cons.Pros:  12X Optical Zoom is superb, color and photo quality is excellent, rugged build quality, uses readily available \"AA batteries\" and lasts considerably long before having to change out batteries. Video capture quality is very good with 640 X 480 resolution and 30 fps. Compatible with high capacity standard SD cards (my 4GB works fine). Fast start up time, and fast shooting mode. Very Ergonomic in your hand and feels just right (not too big or small). Stereo sound with Video is great and option to take still pictures while capturing video is very useful.Cons:  Flimsy feel to lens cap and battery cover (plastic). Image Stabilizer doesn't work quite as well as expected. ISO setting could be higher... max is only ISO 800. Newer cameras go up to ISO 1600. No wide-screen shooting mode for camera or video.Conclusion: Best Bang for the buck in it's class. Though it's really the only camera that does all that it can do for this price and do it well... So it's pretty much in a class of it's own. No other camera on the market (except for it's upgrade... the Canon S3) can compare.

It's no SLR so be honest with yourself!", "Author": "D. Amini", "ReviewID": "R14EBHX39ZQIZ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a big Canon fan. I own several cameras and camcorders. I think Sony makes better DVD camcorders but I have very limited experience with their cameras. Many Sony cameras require the Memory Stick media which is quite pricey so I stick with Canons. I can't comment on the Sony H1 but I do own Canon's G3 and G5. I also compared the Rebel XT to the S2IS and I'll elaborate further.Before I comment about how great this camera is and what a wonderful value this is at under $500, I'll throw out the disclaimer that I use cameras for taking shots of my kids and for weekend hobby shots. I'm not a professional sports photographer but I frequently use manual controls and I understand how to tweak manual settings. If you want to shoot fast action like sport events, you really should buy an SLR.This camera is really quite versatile and will meet the needs of most savy photographers. At this price you can afford a large memory card and rechargable AA batteries. I bought a charger and Nimh batteries for $40. Good luck trying that with a Canon OEM battery! The batteries last close to 400 shots with 50% flash photo usage. The camera size and shape is very comfortable for gripping during action shots. It is very light and makes the Rebel XT feel like a brick. The flash needs to be lifted manually and is quick to charge. The focus and shot to shot time is slower than the Rebel XT but not much slower. Compared to my G3 an G5 it feels very fast. It has pretty quick and accurate autofocus and rivals the Rebel XT in that respect. The photos on the Rebel XT are very soft and not always well focused. The kit lens with the Rebel XT is partially to blame but who wants to spring another $800 for an image stabilized lens with an ultrasonic motor when the S2IS already has one. The Images on the S2IS are razor sharp even at full telephoto. Amazing shots can be taken at full zoom provided you have enough light. The pics are comparable to the G3 and G5 in sharpness but better exposed than these older DIGIC I cameras.  The Rebel was also always underexposed despite my best efforts to change the metering pattern, parameters, and ISO settings. The S2IS is very noisy at an ISO above 200 so don't even think about it unless your prints are small. The Rebel XT should be left at ISO 400 or higher for indoor shots but noise is never an issue with a $1000 SLR so this makes post processing a little easier. No RAW format for the files makes it harder to post process your pics but if you are doing this regularly, stick with the SLR or a G6. At 5MP the files are small enough that the camera moves files around very very quickly. The down side to this is that the XT captures 8MP shots which gives you enough resolution to cut entire people out of group photos and still have enough resolution to print a poster size shot. The S2IS does tend to oversharpen and slightly overexpose shots but the default saturation and contrast settings are good. The shots look better than the G3 and G5 on automatic settings; but with so many manual options on the G3 and G5, I could easily overcome this. The movie mode is really fantastic but it does get grainy in low light. Buy a very large SD card if you are going to film movies.I debated the issue of Rebel XT versus S2IS for weeks. The XT shots are softer and underexposed but the cameras viewfinder and rapid continuous shot abilities are great for the avid outdoor sports photographer. The S2IS is however a very capable and fast camera. It's light, quick, inexpensive, and takes standard batteries. The very powerful zoom and image stabilization makes for razor sharp shots. The downside is the limited 5MP resolution and slightly noisy pics. Also no RAW format. I don't consider any of these to be a downside but be honest with yourself and buy what you need. Remember that the next generation of new and improved cameras will be out in a few years.", "Date": "December 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "Choosing the right megazoom - for me it was S2 IS", "Author": "A. R. Eng \"Engar\"", "ReviewID": "R143I7B2OI7LML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hope this helps you in making your choices--- there are several good mega zooms out there and the decision is not easy!!My main focus was the S2 IS, FZ5, FZ20, Pro 1 and Minolta Dimage A200. Here is where I ended up --I bought and researched most of my information through dpreview, image resource and mega pixel. But I tried the hardware at BH Photo in NYC where I live (actually in NJ across the river). They have a great return policy and I was able to take the FZ5 on a significant adventure to Agra, India -- the Taj Mahal.. The camera performed extremely well. The shots taken were 99 % accurate, the trimming feature was great and the sharpness of the pix were as good as I have ever seen. However I ended up sending it back because of the following - needed more function on the movie settings, the zooming feature was very fast but a little choppy expecially at the long end of the zoom (7-12x) when you I was trying to make subtle changes to framing my shot, I needed more control over the exposure compensation and white balance settings. The FZ5 only allows you to max out at 8 seconds one way and 1/1600 the other way (or was it 1/2000?). Lastly I felt that the camera needed a little more weight for my hand comfort. That is while initially it feels a little flimsy, it is quite well built; but for me it seemed as though I was holding a feather and it didn't feel as right when I was moving to take shots. The spot focus was awesome and got it right all the time though the center-weighted made me do a few double takes from time to time.So what did I do? I went with the S2 -- Why? Because, I like the fact that I can take pix while taking movie clips. I didn't know how much I actually toggle between both modes. I have alot more control over exposure compensation and white balance. S2 offer's more sophisticated flash options (1st-2nd curtain and high/low flash sync). Its cool to have a swivel display. Manual Focus is good for night shots where focus assist can be fooled. Lastly I like the usb20 interface which means I don't have to wait till forever to download a gig (though I do use a reader half the time). The fz5 is usb 1.0. S2 has 15 seconds and 1/3200 on both ends of the shutter I believe.I miss the trimming and resize function the fz5 has; it makes it real easy to make photo adjustments on the fly. Don't like the fact that the S2 has a plastic tripod hole. Like the fact that S2 has AA compatability. And of course love the fact that both cameras have quality long zoom lenses and OIS.My super duper biggest worry on the S2 is the stuff I'm reading on the reviews about the chromatic abberation. I would hate to invest time taking shots I'm looking forward to enjoying only to see purple fringes around my subject. I'm also not as happy about the s2 not providing in the package a lens adaptor -- that whole system is alot larger than the fz5 where I had a uv filter attached to the fz5 body without it protruding too much. The s2 has a longer lense when it is on so the adapter hood is longer too -- that means I'll probably more often than not, skip putting it on and probably scratch the original lense by accident one of these days...So I went with S2 for the features I needed -- the FZ5 is an awesome camera with no CA that I saw. and is extremely fast. It doesn't get fooled especially with spot focus on.Oh btw -- I looked at a200 but didn't like the size, looked at H1 but didn't like size and memory stick and looked at fz20 but didn't like the size and value for the money.. Looked at Pro 1 but felt that if i want 8mp, i'll wait for the rebel xt to go down in price and resurrect my eos lenses...I paid 460 at bhphoto for the s2...Happy huntingEngar...", "Date": "August 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good camera for ameteurs", "Author": "R.

Along with the ability to field-test several cameras, I also researched several operation manuals, gathered and compared camera specifications, and read online photographic reviews by both professionals and consumers.  The Canon S2 is an outstanding camera at a very reasonable price.  The Canon S2 sports a variety of high-end user friendly features including assisted to full manual control, SOLID image stabilization, on camera video editing, and duel microphones with sound controls! Oh it also has a side speaker which tech freaks like myself really dig!  Also the \"My Colors\" option is an amazing amount of fun, and the black and white / sepia effects are cool too!  I found myself taking crisp, defined pictures and video moments after taking the camera out of the box.  One of which included craters on a waning gibbous moon (full 48X zoom hand held!!!)  The updated S3 has got to be a very sweet camera.  I chose the S2 due to the fact that most of the work I do, does not require my pictures to be printed larger than 8 x 10 which the 5 mega-pixels handles quite well.

Just loved it.  It renewed my love of photography after having a few really cheap digital cameras.  However, one day before my first vacation in 6 years, I too got the black screen of death.  After temporarily freaking out, I was fortunately able to find a temporary fix on the internet.  It cleared the problem long enough for me to use my camera for about 6 weeks (got great vacation pics of the PNW) until it died again and was unable to be resurrected (may it rest in peace).  My only saving grace was that I had purchased the Dell extended warranty plan and I still had 7 months to go before that expired.  (Who would have thought?)  In any case, having loved that camera, I took the plunge and purchased the Canon SX20 for $400 and the extended warranty through Fry's.  I'm shocked to see that the S2 is selling new for almost $100 more than the SX20 (the SX10 seems to have escaped the black screen of death so my guess is Canon finally got their you know what together concerning the stuck iris that was causing the problem).  Canon discontinued the S2 model so why would you pay more for this when you can get a 12.1 megapixel camera with HDMI video and a built in wide angle and built in 80x optical zoom lens?  BTW, a few weeks before leaving on vacation, I spent the $100 for the 100mm lens kit for the S2.

I would HIGHLY recommend doing this to anyone who thinks they want a digital SLR camera.  We knew we wanted something better, but did not want to break the bank on a high end camera that we wouldn't make use in terms of features.  This camera is excellent.  It has pushed us to take better, more high quality pictures, and to try for more artistic shots.  We mostly use it to capture day to day things with our babies (who doesn't love baby pictures!), but we try to do some more artsy stuff when we can.  I love that the money we spent makes me feel okay about lugging the camera everywhere and using it as a point and click because if we had splurged on a $500-$1000 camera and we weren't using all the features, I'd feel guilty.  This gives us the best of both worlds!The camera is lightweight (considering the bulkiness of digital SLRs).The shutter speed is good, but we know we want better with the next camera - too many pictures come out fuzzy because people move.The zoom is AMAZING, and so quick I can take a picture of my toddler, then zoom in to her face and get another shot before she moves.The camera takes 4 AA batteries, but doesn't eat through them any faster than your average point and click camera.  Considering the features this offers, I think the battery life is great.The camera has a number of scenes you can use, which was especially great when we were at the beach or when we are having bbqs at night in the summer.Lastly, the video recording is fantastic!!!

The A70 did this well with it's \"action\" setting. That setting is not available on the S2 IS and is really worthless in action situations. I also have a bit of trouble with red-eye.

Most of the features don't really seem to do anything, like the Macro button and image stabilization that doesn't do anything at all as far as I can tell. Canon must have paid off a lot of magazine reviewers to give this camera good reviews. The reviews claimed this camera could focus up to zero distance but that's not true, it will only focus down to about 6\" and that only works if you focus it manually, it won't focus at all in Auto mode except at a distance of infinity then it drifts in and out. The only way to get it to focus is to use one of the non-auto modes. There is a feature that projects a spot of light to help in dark areas but that doesn't do anything at all either. Another problem with this model is that it don't display the battery charge on the screen anywhere. Who designs a camera this bad?

I got it home and started playing with it.Sure, it's a decent camera, but it was obvious that I would eventually want to upgrade to an DSLR.All things considered, there are a couple of ways to think about this camera:One is that it is a relative bargain for what it offers. High resolution, relatively fast shooting speed (compared to other point and shoot cameras), high quality video capability (amazingly good), image stabilized lens (low light shots were still blurry), 12X zoom, macro capability in an all-in-one package. You don't really need any addons except for more memory and a case.The other side is that it is expensive. $450-500 is expensive for anything, and this camera is no exception.For me, I believed the latter. Since I was spending $500, why not  spend a few hundred more (ok 500 more) and just get the Digital Rebel XT?Anyway, after battling the 2 sides for a day or so, I returned the camera and bought the digital rebel XT. My advice is to definitely go for the DSLR, they are in different leagues.The S2 performed poorly in low light. It has an overly complex menu system. The DSLR has more buttons. I like buttons. They are much more accessible than a nested menu system.The S2 was slow, offering 1.5 fps (max) while my DSLR has 3 fps. I found the wait to take my next shot with the S2 agonizingly slow, with the flash much longer.Strangely, the S2 has a lens cap that just won't stay on. Perhaps one of the weakest aspects of the camera. I was holding the camera still, and the cap just slid off to the floor. Be prepared to lose the cap eventually.The S2 has a cheap plastic silver look to it. It looks like the \"flavor of the month\". I'm not sure why so many electronics are plastic silver. Guess it's the trend. I'd much rather have black. I believe the S2 is as heavy as or even heavier than the Digital Rebel XT.Bottom line is the camera may be one of the best sub-DSLR camera out there but it doesn't come close to the DSLR .

We spent 1/2 hour going through the manual to figure out the basics and found a lot of errors in manual.  Much of what we tried didn't work, including how to erase all images.  It had somehow protected an image and we couldn't delete it.  The reference pages were often wrong too.  Luckily one friend had a similar canon camera and could give lessons.  It does have a lot of great features but the documentation should have been better.  It may have been returned if someone hadn't been able to teach the features.  We also blew off the advanced features such as the special effects and used a media editor program, roxio emc8 instead.  When you ignore the over 70 year old market and don't take the documentaiton seriously that is a big strike against the product.
