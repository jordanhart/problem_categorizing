{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty much total garbage", "Author": "Tod Beardsley \"Security Dork\"", "ReviewID": "R2F1YEM0XBYWDS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought two of these things for my kids. Had them in a box for about a month before giving the cameras to them. They had glorious fun for about two hours, until the control panel on one went completely useless. Every button push is registering twice, so every function turns on an then immediately off. Also, you can now take exactly one picture, then the firmware appears to crash. Reboot to take another picture.I know these are cheap cameras. I bought them for little kids, fully expecting them to get handled rough.But, I watched these kids use the cameras, and they did not damage them in any way. They're well trained on our expensive phones.The punchline? I gave them the cameras yesterday -- and this morning, looked at the return policy... and missed the window by a day.So, super unhappy.
