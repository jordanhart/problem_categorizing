{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Huge Disappointment & Waste of Money", "Author": "Inkito \"Inkito\"", "ReviewID": "RSRHEM9PF3O6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my trip to Hawaii.  I took a few pictures with the camera before I submerged it in water, and the pictures turned out fine.  I took it on my kayak trip where it got slightly wet (still have not submerged it in water at this point) and it appeared to be working fine, but soon after submerging it under water to take pictures while snorkeling, water leaked into the case and fried the camera.  I lost all of my photos!  Drying out the camera didn't work.I did not swim more than 9' deep with that camera, and I prepared the camera according to the instructions in the pamphlet.  This camera is poorly constructed and a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.  From now on I'm going to stick with disposable waterproof film cameras because they have never failed me in the past.  I can't convey how disappointing it was to have lost the photos of the sharks, sea turtles, and fish I saw.  \"At best\" this camera is fit for use during activities where a camera may get slightly wet (e.g., kayaking, the water park, beach, etc.).  And if you still want to take a chance with this camera, I would suggest not installing the strap because you should get a better seal without it.  Just pray that camera doesn't slip out of your hand.Additional Note on the Warranty: I'd also like to point out how ridiculous and meaningless their warranty is.  The company charges you $10 so that they can ship the item back to you.  If you take in account the $5-8 you pay to just ship the item to them, you are paying a total of $15 for THEIR mistake!!!  Moreover, that's nearly 1/2 of what the camera cost in the first place.", "Date": "February 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sorry Excuse for a Camera!", "Author": "M. Alvarez", "ReviewID": "R1FHKHPPHI0WMY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ditto on both of the previous reviews!!! Please take them seriously because they know what they are talking about. I would have rated this product with a negative 3 stars if I could have! Unfortunately, I purchased this as a gift for my daughter and she did not get to use it, while snorkeling, until 6 months after the purchase date, so I cannot return this piece of junk! We also followed the directions for underwater usage. We used this \"camera\" at a depth of less than 2 feet. The case leaked and the pictures that the camera did take were so inadequate that I wish I hadn't bothered. The camera was also complicated to use (not a \"point & shoot\") and timed-out/turned off automatically so quickly that it was never ready when we needed it. Definitely not user-friendly and was a nuisance and distraction while we were snorkeling because we spent too much time trying to use the camera. The real disappointment is that I would have had decent pictures if I had used a disposable camera like I have in the past!PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this piece of plastic. I have plenty of experience with digital devices for all sorts of media uses. Many of these, I have purchased through Amazon or other vendors. My research always pays off, but I made a real mistake on this one because I was trying to purchase a simple digital camera that my 10-year old could use under water -- my mistake -- I should have been more diligent in my research. Amazon would be doing their customers a huge favor if they would STOP SELLING THIS PRODUCT!!", "Date": "July 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Bad quality", "Author": "Sharon K.

Tierney \"JT\"", "ReviewID": "R62VFROOUD101", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wasn't expecting much when I bought this $35 camera, but I was amazingly disappointed with how truly awful this item is. The camera does not have a data card, like every other digital camera in the world, so you can't increase its memory, and worse, you have to download a program onto your computer to be able to use it. The program interface is surprisingly user unfriendly. Imagine playing Pong without a controller. I took about 15 photos with this camera, all above water during broad daylight. Each photograph's clarity is strikingly similar to an oil spill. I believe this same camera was used to take the famous Loch Ness Monster photo taken earlier in the 20th Century. So for all you super-natural creature / UFO buffs, this is the camera for you! In closing, it stinks. Don't waste your money.", "Date": "February 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "No way to increase memory!", "Author": "J. Miksch", "ReviewID": "R5E8EPPC9WVWI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera was very inexpensive, but has only 8 megs of memory.... with no way to increase that amount! Picture quality was fairly low (expected for the price) using it underwater was difficult as the view finder was so small making seeing what was being photographed difficult. No LCD viewer means wait until you download to see if they came out well. Star rating based upon what was expected... if you want a cheap camera for a couple of underwater memories, go for it, although I think there are others priced about the same with a memory slot.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Stay away from this camera!!", "Author": "M. Shulman \"High Def Enthusiast\"", "ReviewID": "RPRSLU0U356AQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Like the other reviews said, this product is complete junk!I bought this for $70 while vacationing in Saint John.  I should have spent the same money and bought 2 disposable cameras.  I figured it would be better to spend more and have a reusable camera.  Boy was I wrong!I tried a few different options - with compression, without compression.  In the water, out of the water.  I ended up with no pictures that looked good.  Even when I took pictures out of the water.  I'm convinced you need a tripod to get a halfway decent looking picture with this camera.The only plus is that the waterproof case did work.  Water never got into the case.  Its just too bad it didn't take any decent pictures.The other issue with this camera is that the pictures are 640x480.  That alone is fine if the pictures could be accessed in this format.  But the software that comes with it (and the only way it seems pictures can be copied off the camera), interpolates the pictures raising the resolution.  This is a bad idea as it will only reduce the quality of the picture.  They should at least provide a way to get the unaltered image from the camera.  Regardless, I don't think it would have made any difference as the pictures were THAT bad!The only good experience I had was with tech support.  I emailed them about some questions on getting the images off the camera.  They replied quickly.  Unfortunately though I had to guess at the support email since their website has ZERO support information - same as the documentation.So in summary, I wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone.  I'd also question any other camera's by this company simply due to them selling such a poor camera and having zero support info on their website.Buy a canon powershot or other similiar camera and an underwater case for it.  Your money will be MUCH better spent!", "Date": "November 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "SNAP,SNAP,SNAP.....", "Author": "Mary Gibbons", "ReviewID": "R28HSG8GOUX3MT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great camera,easy for my grand daughter to use she is 6.
