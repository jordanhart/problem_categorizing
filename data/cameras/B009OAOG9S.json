Might be small for some people, might be missing some features, but for someone who just wants a camera with a good sensor (it's an incredible sensor, well worth the money, by the way) and would settle for no auto focus and would just as soon shoot using manual controls for exposure rather than auto, I can't complain at all. Going to get my wife to move from Canon to Nikon now.If you are just taking snapshots, 13 megapixel setting ought to suffice, so you don't use up way too much space on your sd card.If you want more detail, of course, use 24 mp, but for serious shots, go full tilt and go 24 mp and raw.Hope this helps anyone who is trying to decide whether to get this camera.Get it.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good camera for begining photographer", "Author": "DaSarge \"DaSarge\"", "ReviewID": "RPLJUYQB5GQDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for my 12 year old grandson who wants to learn all about photography and be my assistant in my professional photography business. This would be complicated for an average youngster but he is dedicated, willing to learn and this camera is relatively easy to use when how to use it is taught by an experienced Nikon camera user. This camera when set to the factory defaults and on automatic function does an excellent job of determining all the settings of shutter speed, ISO (sensor sensitivity to light), f/stop and most important proper focusing for sharp clear photos. Setting on full automatic or use of the proper \"scene\" settings it's easy to get great photographs.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great value, great quality", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R23SHQ37UBOJOG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lot's of great features and very high quality photos.

If you are new to photography you will love it. If you have some previous experience with photography you will still love it. Sure it doesn't have all the features of a Full Frame camera, but it really does get the job done. It would make any professional photographer happy to keep as a backup camera while traveling. I've used this camera for a few shoots and I paired it with the Nikon 35mm DX lens. The photos looked fantastic and the model was really happy with the results.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "D3200 (refurbished) : impression", "Author": "marek-z-modry", "ReviewID": "R1R0R3S7RVVWW8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all: as somebody already said in this internet universe, I rate \"refurbished\" higher than \"new\": the refurbishedwas kindly tested for us by a volunteer, and returned to the factory for cleanup. This is my ultimate strategy with camerasas well as laptops. Nowadays, parts are cheap for either on ebay, so there is no need to rely on service, at least by the timeChina closes its special inventories of spare electronics parts.My immediate impression from D3200 was disappointment. I looked at the display max-zoomed, and the picture did notlook right. Worse than my D5100, that I left on the train seat 3 weeks ago, with 135/F2 on it. But then I downloaded pictures,and saw. It is frightening, the amount of detail. It is simply not the picture you saw when composing.It's like photographing with microscope, as you by habit blow up the picture on the screen to 100% and scan around.D5100 felt halfway of this phenomenon, you went to the waters but did not submerge. So what is this toy good for? I alreadyhave my mind split: it would be so relieving to forget about this and just have a nice camera with few MP and watch on thescreen what you composed and maybe print. But with this camera I can't get rid of feeling that I'm not composing, butthrowing nets into deep waters, and we will see what it shows afterwards, when the nets are pulled out!What can I say? This camera is outstanding toy, I'm not sure what is it good for in the end, but there is no way I could say I havent been impressed.Note added: I have my own measurement of ISO sensitivity, and I rate this sensor to ISO 100 in SHADOW areas for myself (don't worry at normal daylight condition!). Really, that's when I stop seeing these white-yellow or green-blue ghost patterns looking like surface wetting. I have an easy way around though: turn off the color by setting the camera to monochrome. So what. There are probably borderline situations when you want to see the color and it's hard but possible to get it right; but in most situations when you see the color shows artifacts, it is not relevant and BW will do. (Though some people dream in color, I hear.) D5100 was not better at 100% crop in this respect, D3200 would definitely be better if pictures were viewed at the same output size. This is not meant to say that pictures at 3200 or even 6400 if you like are useless!", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "It works like new", "Author": "bjyoung", "ReviewID": "R1W4GW9M3WCN2D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this refurbed D3200 for my 13 years old daughter.  Since she's been using my D7100 and is very familiar with the Nikon platform, this will be a good bridge camera until I can upgrade and give her the D7100.  She loves the D3200 so far and I can hold on to my D7100 a little longer.  She is beyond the Guide mode but her novice friends love it.  It has enticed her friends to become very interested in digital photography beyond their smart phones.It's currently mounted to a Sigma 18-200mm DC lens but my daughter wants an f/1.8 35mm prime lens.  I think that will be a great combination and will meet her needs better.I played with it briefly in my backyard garden using different settings and couldn't find any obvious fault.  The refurbished body is spotless and package comes with original documentation, battery, charger, cables, and strap.  The D3200 is definitely small for me but perfect for a young girl's hands.I am completely happy with this purchase.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "D3200", "Author": "Ms. Coney", "ReviewID": "R232SAPY04SR8H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this to go along with my D3100. So far so  good! I used it to shoot a wedding and there was a moment where it stalled in the middle of shooting but once I turned it off then back on it was fine. Hoping that doesn't happen again.

Looks brand new, and only $330. Coming from a Nikon D70 from 2004, this camera is pretty amazing for the money. It's not as sturdy as the D70 but the manual controls are all there, it works with a remote, and combined with the 35mm f1.8 prime lens, I can't believe its low light capabilities. I will rarely ever use a flash.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great purchase!", "Author": "Lawrence Stanger", "ReviewID": "RSPW24MB4VSW0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first purchase of a refurbished product and the Nikon D3200 (body only) looked brand new when it arrived.  I also purchased the Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 35mm 1:1.8G lens as the camera's standard lens and have \"given\" my seldom-used but incredible Nikon AF-S Micro NIKKOR 60mm 1:2.8G ED lens for macro and short telephoto shooting.  So far this camera with these two lenses is truly delightful to use, rivaling the photographic quality of my higher end equipment.I use a Nikon D600 with six prime and zoom NIKKOR lenses for normal shooting, but the D600 with battery grip and pro glass can be extremely uncomfortable to hike with, even when using a Jobe sling (Jobe Ultrafit Sling Strap for DSLRs - excellent product!) that puts the camera by my hip instead of bouncing on my chest.  Short hikes are not bad, but I live in the Mojave Desert Ecosystem that begs for more typical 8-12 mile hikes.  The D3200 was purchased as a secondary camera to carry on longer hikes when lighter lenses, especially primes, will fill my wants and needs for glass power.  So far it has exceeded all my expectations though I miss the front sub command dial since I normally shoot in aperture priority mode.The D3200 has given me fewer than 100 photos so far during less than a month of ownership, but the photographic experience has been well worth \"stepping down\" from the D600.  I also like how I can use all my FX lenses with this camera and am preparing to do a 30-mile hike with the two cameras mounted on a Cotton Carrier Camera System for Two Cameras.  The D3200 will be dwarfed by a Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 28-300mm 1:3.5-5.6G lens, giving the camera a 450mm effective reach.
