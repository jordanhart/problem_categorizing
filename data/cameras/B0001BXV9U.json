They connect to your home net via ethernet. Management programs can display the images from the cameras on your computer screen.I recently examined a Hawking camera. Superficially, it seemed to have security, but there were only two official ways to get an image from the camera.  One was by using a facility where the camera e-mailed you an image. This image was tagged as spam by my provider because it used the big5 character set, even though it contained no text. But the other way was to use a java applet which was automatically downloaded from the camera, the same way any applet would be loaded.This was the only image data displayed on the camera's web interface.I wanted to get a still image, so I traced the applet's data stream.  The applet simply connected to a port on the camera and then presented four characters and a newline. The camera responded with a four byte header and a jpeg. I was able to use echo, sleep and netcat to pull jpegs out of the camera - but I did not have to present the password to pull jpegs out of the camera.The instructions that come with the camera tell you to open this port to the Internet via port forwarding from your firewall.  You also open the camera's web port.If you do this, then a hacker can see that you have this camera and then they can look for other open ports, and if they find the camera port, they can easily pull jpegs out of it with no password.This is OK, though, since the camera is so incredibly bad that all that anyone will see is sort of a flesh shaped amorphous mass.  I took this camera back to the store.There are two other products on the market. One is the D-Link DCS-900W, and the other is the Linksys Wireless G. Both are comparable to the Hawking and way better.The Linksys presents both sound and video as an MPEG4 stream. I know of no way to get still images from this camera (other than by having the camera e-mail you one).  There is an active X control that allows you to view the video on a windows system, or, with the right codecs, you can use Media Player or Mplayer to view the stream.  However, only a Windows user using Internet Explorer can access the camera through the web interfacr and see full motion video. Everyone else can go through multiple layers of frames to determe what the url is for the mpeg4 stream - then, that URL can be fed to a regular media player that can play (or record) an mpeg4 stream.The Linksys can be connected to a 10 or 100 wired ethernet, or to an 802.11b or 802.11g wireless net.  It supports WEP.  By default it is configured to run at a fixed address - but it can run on WEP.  A unique feature is that it has a small LCD panel and the LCD panel displays the IP address that it uses. It can look for motion within the camera and send out alerts by e-mail if motion is detected (that is, no external program is required to deal with automated motion detection from this camera).  All data is presented on the web interface, and basic authentication (userid and password) is demanded if the camera is set up to require it before the video stream, or any data other than the base screen is presented. There are two levels of users - those who can display the video stream and one user who can administer the box.I have not installed the Linksys management software - it seems to be unneeded. If I could find an open source solution that would allow me to convert mpeg4 to a still jpeg, then this would be the winning solution. But the conversion stacks I have found garble the images horribly. I believe that there is conversion available in the support software.The D-Link has a URL where a jpeg can be accessed.  All interaction is via web - and all interaction requires basic security.  There are two levels of users - One user who can configure the camera and those who can just display pics.The D-Link has a Java applet and an active-X control - take your pick - that allows you to view motion pictures - and it also has full motion video - so you can view full motion video from any browser that supports Java applets, or, if you are an IE user who has not installed Java, you can use the Active-X control to look at the video. Thus, the full motion video should work for almost everyone - I know it works in Linux and Windows. The D-Link has the best low light capability. It also has the clearest picture, by far.  It does not have 802.11g and it does not have sound. It does support WEP. Internally, (to the applet) the motion data is presented as a series of jpegs, using a standard http stream format. All video or jpeg data is presented only after successful basic authentication.The management software for the D-Link camera works reasonably well, but there is no reason to use it other than, perhaps, for upgrading the flash - although the \"lite\" software can present a very high quality full screen full motion video.  All motion detection recording on the D-Link is done in an application on a connected windows PC.These cameras cost a few dollars more than the Hawking, but they actually have a modicum of security.The Linksys is a winner if you need sound, or if you want to get the extra performance of an 802.11g device - if you do not have any 802.11b devices, you might well not want to introduce the first one.If you need motion detection in the camera, the Linksys devices also win.  Linksys cameras and a wireless router would obivate the need for a computer onsite, and, with a DSL connection, say, would allow for the accumulation, at a central site, of images where motion was detected.If you do not need sound - say, for a manned security setup, the D-Link cameras would allow you to put 16 cameras on a single screen - no wiring cost, and you could have motion detection and recording. That would be expensive, but probably much cheaper than any other solution.  Considering that you could avoid wiring, it would be a winner.", "Date": "February 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "best bang/buck=winner", "Author": "Geeko \"amazon14143\"", "ReviewID": "R2TAFMM75RHONZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "for the price, this is a great tool. if u need night time viewing, add a motion detector.i found a 4x4x6 waterproof plastic box at Home Depot, begged them for a 3x3 glass scrap, and mounted this outside w/motion detector light (see above). we'll see how it handles Florida sun next summer.bingo! i now have 5 of these running very nicely.please note that i use free linux software instead of PC monitoring app (IP-View) that comes with it, but friends seem to have good luck w/that app. the linux app ('motion') allows me to mix USB, video, and network cams in one survelliance app.newest firmware for cam (2.28) hasn't crashed since i booted it over a week ago fyi.", "Date": "November 21, 2004"}, {"Title": "Good camera  -Good price", "Author": "Mike Wong \"Tech-y\"", "ReviewID": "R2UBSRBLMKN8PK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased several of these cameras and I am very pleased with their performance.

This camera seems to require minimum 5-10 lux. For example in the evening, even on a well lit street it is already very difficult to distinguish the shape of my car less than 10 feet away. Also indoors there is a lot of noise under any amount of artificial light, unless you put your face in front of the camera or the area is lit by natural sun light. Basically after 5 PM the quality gets pretty bad and after 6 PM the cam becomes unusable.It might be OK for video conferencing if you sit next to your computer with a lamp pointed at your face, however this doesn't require a wireless network camera since many USB models under $50 can perform better.The camera frame rate on my wireless network is less than 5 fps, though not sure if this is a performance problem with my wireless router (Microsoft), so I am not putting the full blame on the camera.Generally the concept of wireless network camera is great, but it would need to be coupled with a decent camera. As a standard Webcam this camera wouldn't be worth more than $20.I've had to do some research to discover that CCD cameras are much better than CMOS, especially in low-light, so I will be looking specifically for those now, even if they are USB-only.

Groves", "ReviewID": "R25MZMP743K26D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had quite a lot of trouble with this camera at the beginning.  The range of the camera seemed ridiculously limited and the camera seemed to fritz out on a regular basis for no apparent reason.After downloading the firmware update for this camera and installing it, the flakiness disappeared, but the limited range remained a problem.  Basically it could not be more than a couple of feet from the wireless access point and still work.  After much frustration with this, I finally decided to CAREFULLY open up the camera to see if I could find anything that was obviously wrong with the electronics inside.I'm glad that I did!  I found that the wire from the antenna had become disconnected from the circuit board (or never was connected at the factory).  The snap-on connector at the end of the antenna lead is extremely small and weak and the cable from the antenna is fairly rigid, so any amount of jarring of the camera could cause the connector to pop-off of the circuit board.D-Link should have used something to tie-down the cable to the circuit board to prevent the connector from popping off.Well, I carefully popped the snap-on connector for the antenna lead back on the circuit board and VERY carefully reassembled the camera.Voila!  The camera now has excellent WiFI range!The IPView Lite software that comes with the camera and that you can get an upgrade for from the D-Link web site is not reliable on Windows 2000.  It crashes all of the time.  It seems to be more reliable on Windows XP.  I suggested to the developers that they release the IPView Lite to Open Source so that people could work on it to improve its reliability.

Both ActiveX and Java support for viewing means that virtually every browser is supported...Configuration is a breeze, all you need to do is make sure you hook the camera to some hub or router that has another computer attached in the 192.168.0.x IP range (for the duration of configuring the camera you could also hookup the computer directly to the camera with a crossover cable of course). You do not even have to install the software on your computer: Just make sure you can browse to the camera's default address of 192.168.0.20. Wireless configuration was easy as well: put in the settings, unplug ethernet cable, reboot the camera and you are all done! (my camera is only 25 feet away from the wireless router in the same room, so I did not test the wireless range of the camera)If you want the camera to be reachable from the internet you of course need to do some port forwarding in your router, good idea to enable the second port on the camera (nice feature you can use a port different than port 80) so you can reach the camera on some high unknown port (providers often block incoming traffic on port 80 as they do not want their customers to be running webservers...).The support for Java makes it easy to \"plug\" your camera in any website you might have (that is what I did and it works wonderfully). Support to define an NTP server is also nice: your camera shows the correct time always. Ability to hand out usernames and passwords to your family and friends: nice as well.Quality of the video is very acceptable for a camera in this price range.

If you have set-up and played around with other computing devices, then you will have no big problems.The manual is weak!

The mounting bracket and swivel-head make orientating the camera simple.Setting up the camera using a regular network connecting cable was straightforward.To set-up wireless functionality ensure that you are able to configure your router. That is, use the router's web administration utility to view and change some of its settings. The `Network Name SSID' required in the camera admin utility requires the name of your router (my router's default name was the brand name). This was not obvious to me. The manual was not at all helpful here. I found my answer in my router manual.Download and install the latest install program, firmware (software that gets installed on the camera itself, not your PC) and IPView Lite application from the D-Link website. I actually had to use a separate FTP utility as a web browser was unable to download the files - I tried several. Also, the Canadian website only seemed to allow downloads during business hours.Operation:The camera seems to run well so far - 2 weeks. The IPView Lite utility is simple and effective to manage the camera.The IPView Lite software is required to use the Motion Sensing ability, to update the firmware and a few other settings. I have found that even on the lowest setting, the motion detector is too sensitive. I had to place the camera in several places before things like a tree's slightly swaying shadow would not set it off, even on its lowest setting - the wider the view, the more things that will set it off.If you wish to view your camera outside of your home via the web, you will have to configure your router even more.

This might get a little wordy though. In reading some of these reviews, I notice that a lot of people have trouble understanding Networking technology (BIG surprise), causing them to suffer through tech support calls. But, knowing even a few basics, can help avoid having to make that dreaded call... As most people now know, WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is badly broken, and is only good for keeping honest people out of your WEP enabled network. The DCS-900W only supports WEP. My home wireless network is configured for WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access), which offers much stronger security, (but only as strong as you make your pass phrase). I didn't want to open up my entire LAN to black-hat hackers, by adding a WEP access point, just so I could add the camera. So, here's what I did to keep my network safe, and still use the WEP based camera... I happened to have another router, and another Access Point (has to be two separate units). I used my laptop to configure them through an Ethernet cable. First, I set the router's (that is, the additional router's) LAN address to an available address within my existing LAN: 192.168.254.253, (Use the same SUBNET MASK as everything else: 255.255.255.0). Then, I set the WAN IP to a static address of: 192.168.1.1. Then, I configured the Access Point to have a static LAN IP address of 192.168.1.2. Of course you also have to configure the wireless stuff (i.e. SSID, WEP, 64, or 128 bit encryption...). Now that the new router and Access Point have been configured, here's how to connect them up... Using Ethernet cable, connect from your existing router, hub, or switch, to a LAN port on the new router. Then, connect the Access Point to the new router's WAN port (It might be labeled \"Internet\"). Now you need to create a \"static route\" in your original router's configuration, that will allow users who's PCs reside on your network (in my case, on the 192.168.254.0 segment) to access the camera(s) which reside on the 192.168.1.0 network segment. The static route parameters (fields) should be something like this: Active or Enable,  Name (of the route (it's just a name)),  Destination IP (in my case, the added network segment address: 192.168.1.0) (It might need to be entered as: 192.168.1.0/24 (the /24 indicates 24 bits of the segment address or another way of saying there's 24 bits in the subnet mask)),  Gateway (in my case, the LAN IP address of the new router: 192.168.254.253). If the router's IP is 192.168.1.1, and your Access Point's IP is: 192.168.1.2, then your camera(s) can have any IP in the range of: 192.168.1.3-254... At this point, you can access anything on the \"1\" subnet from the \"254\" subnet.  Now, I haven't tested the following with my setup, so you might need to play with IP addresses here, to make it work? If you want the camera(s) to be able to access DNS (Domain Name System), and NTP (Network Time Protocol) servers, you'll need to open some ports on the new router. This is called \"Port Forwarding\" or \"Virtual Server\" or \"Firewall Rules\" (Depending on what your router manufacturer wants to call it). Anyway, you'll want to configure \"Inbound Rules\". For DNS, the Port is: 53 for both TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) & UDP (User Datagram Protocol). For NTP, the Port is: 123 for UDP. You want to \"Allow Always\".  For the destination IP, depending on how versatile your router is, you might try giving it the LAN IP address of your original router, or maybe the actual destination IP of the server providing the service. Once the ports have been opened, the cameras and the Access Point should all be able to use DNS and NTP services.  I've said all of that to say this... Having another router added to your existing infrastructure, provides a safe way to incorporate any equipment that is limited to WEP. Assuming your added router has NAT (Network Address Translation) turned on, Nothing malicious is coming through it, into your original LAN. And if your Access Point can disable wireless to wireless communications, then even if someone does obtain a wireless connection to the Access Point, the only thing they can even attempt to do is guess the Admin password to the Access Point. So, make it STRONG. But that's ALL they can do.

I recommend this camera as it is easy to configure on a secure WEP 64 network and has a java OR Active X interface.  A key problem with the Linksys WVC54GC is that is only works in active X. So for example when I use my Opera browser on my WII (the big screen) or my MAC.. only my DLink can show the image.. You could say linksys is not MAC friendly. I must say this device is a little uglier.. but hey it has worked for 6 years which certainly says something about durability. Recommendations.. don't install the IPView software unless you plan to record your images.. If you do, it works great... it will allow your computer to record pics only when there is motion in the camera. I recommend all configuration be done with the web interface. Given everyone's home network is uniquely configured... I recommend temporarily taking one of your computers off of your home network and plugging it into the camera for a 1:1 network during configuration.. just makes it much easier.

I needed to have this unit serviced after 7 months because I could not connect to the unit anymore. Soft Reboot, Hard Reboot did not solve it, DLink was nice enough to send me another unit. Took about 2 weeks turn around. That was about 9 months ago, I have had this camera mounted on top of my house over looking the front yard. In the day time the image is very crisp at 640x480, I only hope one day a 1280x1024 resolution would come out so I can view my entire yard just instead of my front porch. I have a piece of saramic taped on it, so the water will not get absorbed into the unit. It has survived the cold winters and also the rainy season as well. It holds up well outside, you just need to cover the unit.Nite time viewing is not soo great, it is very grainy but what can you expect w/o a builtin night vision modular. I use webcamxp with this software to broadcast it over the web and also to send me email alerts triggered by the motion senor. I like to check up on my UPS and Post Man every once in a while to see what they are up to. :) I recommend using WeBCamXP with this unit because it has a lot of nice features which the DLink software does not have. The interface can be a lot better, but I just use it for its camera feature and nothing else, so it does not bother me.I highly recommend this unit if you want to look over your new puppy inside the house or view your property.

The concept is GREAT.  The software is HORRIBLE!  The documentation is even WORSE!!!I hate it when a manufacturer goes through all the trouble to create a magnificent product, but then skimps on the software/drivers/documentation/etc.  This is a perfect example.  The device is rock-solid -- could not ask for a sturdier product without going to industrial quality (and price).  The software looks like it was written to entertain children!  The developers focused SO MUCH on creating pretty icons (that are actually ugly), that they completely forgot about usability -- and worse, they forgot to document!!!  There are no pop-up tips over any icons, nor is there any sort of Help feature anywhere.  There is a PDF owners manual, but it seems like it was written by a 10-year-old.  Half of the features are not even mentioned in the document.  It's extremely frustrating to know that the functionality is there, but I will have to poke around at the stupid software for days before I discover it!  Basically, a developer spent days coding each feature, but could not spend 2 minutes to put a label and description on it.  Features that nobody knows about or how to use are USELESS!If this device had even half-way decent software and documentation, it would get 5 stars -- but the software and documentation is so poor that it gets only 3 stars (maybe even just 2).As for the hardware, here's my review..SPEED: This device uses 802.11b, so it is limited to 11 Mbps, which can be too slow for video with moderate/high frame rates.  However, for security purposes, 5 frames per second is sufficient (slightly choppy video, but better than most VCR-based security systems).  I haven't tried recording at higher frame rates.  I imagine that if compression is set to high, fairly high frame rates can be achieved.IMAGE: This device can record up to 640x480 pixel video.  However, the software only supports 320x240.  In daylight, video seems relatively crisp, even at high compression.  At night, the camera doesn't fare as well.  D-Link makes other cameras that have much better night vision than this one.  If you're looking for a night-time camera, consider a different model.  The camera has a rotary focus dial on the lens, which can be set from close-up (20cm) through infinity.CHASIS: The camera housing is sturdy and the base is actually made of cast metal (I expected cheap plastic, but was pleasantly surprised).  The most-delicate part of the unit is the screw-on antenna.  It's not poorly made, but just not as rugged as the rest of the camera.  The camera is NOT intended for outdoor use.  I have it temporarily mounted on a window sill, pointed towards the front of my house.  Eventually, I will actually attach it to the window frame.  The base can be screwed into either the top or bottom of the camera, so it can be mounted on a ceiling, wall, bookshelf, or wherever you'd like -- nicely done.Initial setup (getting it onto the network and seeing video) is somewhat straight forward, but the poor software and documentation become apparent right away.  Advanced setup (video surveillance, motion detection, recording, etc.) is EXTREMELY frustrating.  I'm searching for 3rd party video surveillance software to use with it because I hate the packaged software so much.The webcam comes with its own built-in webserver, so it can host its own website (nice feature).  The built-in browser-based setup screen (kind of like configuring a LinkSys or D-Link router) does have a Help menu!  However, the only thing it has is the following text: \"For Help on Web Configuration settings, please refer to the Manual included with your Internet Camera.\"  =-PGood luck!!!", "Date": "April 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "okay - not great.", "Author": "Wellard", "ReviewID": "R13SGUCMDSHQKG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm running this camera on a mac.

The configuration routine that they tried to get me to run through made no sense until I took charge and told him how to get the camera talking to an Apple network.  At that point I got him to guide me through the browser based configuration tool.  When we got the camera working I was basically left with a camera that was streaming live footage that I could see on a browser, but had no software that was able to capture live feeds or still images.The only saving grace was that we already had two hard wired cameras capturing images to our website and that has given us some proficiency in capturing images and getting them to a web page.  Unfortuately, even armed with that knowledge would would have been left high and dry if it were not for my wife being able to hack the server on the camera to find the still images that it was streaming.

The instructions are not too clear when you have other name brand routers. The camera works great once it is set up properly. But, it cannot be view from anywhere, it has it's limitation. Because of the software design being used, the video stream is viewed via an applet that is started up from where-ever you are viewing. If the computer you are using is behind a firewall and because of security reasons most ports are closed except http 8080, you are out of luck. First of all, I doubt if the administrator of the firewall will open the port you need to see the video stream since that would open other security issues for the administrator. Second, since the video is seen via a local Java applet that is initialized and it begins to look for the open port, this is not a welcomed design in most organizations with firewall administration. They may think you are trying to hack their firewall from within. Anyhow, they should have used an http video stream protocol that can be viewed via a window media player or some other popular media player so that a specific video transfer port is not necessary. The only way around this issue is to have the video stream displayed via that same applet on your personal website that you may have secure access to.
