{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Good System in price category", "Author": "O", "ReviewID": "R10BRF3DOJAJJP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned this product for almost a year and so far it works. It should probably get 4.5 stars because I do believe Samsung can improve it. The one star rating is unfair expectations based on the price point. I owned other cameras with high resolution and professional grade DVR and they cost a lot more. I used this in conjunction with this Samsung camera system.  It is great for entrances and inside the house where it is well lit.What I like:Easy do it yourself security system. The day time picture quality is excellent and color is amazing. There are two things that affect image resolution: one is the cameras' tv lines or pixels and the DVR recording capability. You can set the recording to be better for the cameras that you need to be the sharpest and back off on the ones that are not as critical. For example, choose CIF for best picture and higher record rate for real time at least 30 fps.The best cameras out there are 700 TV lines and DVR records at 720 x 480 pixels. This system can come pretty close.Easy to view back captured video that are recorded based on motion (save disc space) or continuous. It has a remote and on screen menu is intuitive. I like the Cat 5 wiring instead of those BNC and power supply connectors that most used.For the money, it is very good value.What could be improved:The night vision is poor but you would pay more money for cameras with a lot more IR LEDs with longer range. The work around this is to put a motion triggered light and light up the area and the camera can capture higher resolution or you can install IR LED flood lights.The network setup is tricky but it is tricky for other camera system too- so you need tech support to help here.Camera is not vandal proof but then again, for the money one should not expect it to be. There is no adjusting on the focus and focal length but again you would find these features on high end cameras. Frankly, if you are not technical, you would probably be frustrated trying to adjust too many features. It has a BNC port so it can accept at least one of those higer resolution cameras but Samsung has a disclaimer.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointing, no support", "Author": "Helwoe!", "ReviewID": "R1WMPNVIJFOYKT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Overall a huge disappointment. After a few months of use I've dropped this review down to 1 star. It seems that Samsung has completely abandoned this product as there is virtually no support or information.  Here is what I have learned and collected for anyone still trying to make this work for you. Be thankful as you will not find this information easily.The login you choose for the DVR must be only 8 characters. Manual does NOT tell you this. If you plan on using the program Smartview 3.0. After troubleshooting 1/2 a day I found this to be why I could not connect with my 16 character(secure)password I set. 8 character password is piss poor for security but if you keep it on your local LAN no big deal.Smartview is a nice program and does everything you can do on the unit but after a while for whatever reason the application with crash on you at start up. After a few installs on new computer system it always eventually will crash. Possibly some Microsoft update who knows but Tech support will not reply to you and when talking to a person you realize they are absolutely clueless as to how to fix it. The software on the unit (mouse & on-screen keyboard) is seriously ridiculous and tedious to use. If the software would work I would add 3 stars. Thats how badly it cripples your system not being able to use SmartViewer.Setup your DVR IP address in your router to static outside of your domain. If you have 192.168.1 through 192.168.1.100 then set it to above that for example 192.168.1.200.  Forward ports 8000-8160 and 554-558 both TCP (not TCP/UDP) to your desktop IP address (DVR defaults) No other numbers will work so only use those. I purchased a SED-1006R for sound with video recording at my front door, had to get replaced because sound was not working so got it replaced. Sound from the unit must be powered by a separate funky one plug speaker system, however sound to my desktop via SmartView works ok although the sound is mono not stereo.Motion detection is ok, though I've seen better. The squares are a bit too large and make it difficult to cover finite regions. My biggest complaint is glare at night (car lights) that trigger motion events. A shiny car and or wet pavement can reflect and trigger events easily even on the lowest detection setting.I originally had it set for each camera to record at highest settings (4CIFL(L) 15FPS Level 8 ) with just motion events but have since changed 3 camera's set for continuous record and 1 motion event with same quality settings. The hard drive capacity right now is 20 day's recorded at 800Gbs full so roughly 23 days with 4 camera's 3 with continuous, 1 event. I would venture to guess that with 8 cameras you would get a week with say 6 continuous and 2 event. On the other hand based on what I've observed looking at drive usage you could easily get 3-4 months set to motion event with 8 cameras if you have normal activity (cats, birds, occasional insects around camera. I plan to water proof the ethernet connections as they are outside and susceptible to moisture in the connectors. Heatwrap tubing and electrical tape should work fine.I wanted this product to work but I'm bailing on this for something far better.", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor video processing quality", "Author": "J. Gallo", "ReviewID": "R2K1SQYW17AWQH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Some reviews mention the poor video quality of these Samsung cameras, but I believe the problem resides in the DVR video output. I came to this conclusion after connecting an additional camera of good quality to the DVR, and the video output turned out to be the same. On the positive side, the software is very intuitive and the feature-set is absolutely useful; the build quality of the cameras is also strong...But again, the poor quality of the video output is a deal breaker.

The first one would not even boot up and was returned...I should have known then this was not going to be a good experience. In order for the 4001 to function off the LAN via the Samsung iPolis app for remote viewing, it needs a firmware upgrade, which the machine will not install. Countless calls to tech support (not 24/7 support mind you) have resulted in no progress, a month later and it still does not work as advertised.First I was told it was port forwarding on the router, then it was my flash drive was \"too big\", then it was do not unzip the file, install it that way, then it was unzip it and install it that way. (Either way, the problem was always shifted to being my fault, despite following tech support's instructions to the letter each time, each rep telling me something different.) Then tech support directed me to a support site that wanted $39.99 for access. It doesn't matter, the machine will not install the upgrade regardless and I am tired of Samsung's smug run-around and LACK of support. The machine recognizes the firmware update on the flash drive by name and refuses to install it. End of story.If you think this machine will function as advertised \"out of the box\" you are sadly mistaken. Once again Samsung makes a low quality product and blames the consumer for its poor programming and faulty components. I will add it to my heap of faulty Samsung products including the 46\" tv that broke a month out of warranty and the Galaxy S2 with the faulty battery.Samsung.....buyer beware.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Picture Quality is not up to par", "Author": "Jason A Lee", "ReviewID": "R36FH0K768G4US", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I finally had to use this dvr system to review someone who stole a package in front of my house at night time.

I didn't have a LAN connection in the closet where its installed, so without built in wifi i needed a \"bridged router\"...(receives wireless signal and has plugs to connect LAN lines).

There is no information about waterproofing the camera connections in the install manual, so I figured they were waterproofed as well as they needed to be since it's called an indoor/outdoor system.  When I called customer service for the warranty the guy tells me that it's common knowledge that the installer should take extra measures to waterproof the connections/cameras.  Not covered under warranty.They should have noted this in the installation guide rather than letting customers find this out on their own.  Now I have to get a new camera and electrical cord to replace the camera that was damaged that Samsung won't replace.Otherwise it works well.  I can view the cameras from my phone or any computer anytime.  Setting up the remote viewing is impossible to do on your own if you're not a computer genius.  I am pretty computer literate, but couldn't get the remote viewing to work on my own.

Controls, several ways to control the DVR (Samsung Digital Video Recorder):  a] Mouse and Computer screen, (quick, complete menus for full control).  b] Front panel buttons (limited, good for selecting which camera to view, or start recording).  c] Remote Control (IR, similar to TV remote), more buttons than  Front panel.  d] External computer over Internet, (can remotely control unit)  e] Pass word control, with several levels of access.2. Viewing, several options:  a] Computer monitor used for viewing near the DVR box, can show all cameras at once (thumb nails), or sequence through all cameras, or zoom in on one camera, and many other viewing options.  (Use 15 pin VGA cable,  a 90 degree cable allows mounting the monitor flush to wall, Tripp Lite brand cables supports high resolution for longer distances;  Can use powered high frequency VGA video splitter to drive two monitors in adjacent rooms)  b] RCA Monitor: Separate video output for 2nd monitor(can show a different picture than is displayed on computer monitor), can show a single camera, or auto sequence through all cameras.  Lower resolution, but can be placed further away, I used 60 foot cable, (Belden 1694A, cost more but has low-loss for long runs, from Ram Electronics).  c] Smart phone app:  Small picture, but great for adjusting cameras outside.  Works with some (but not all) smart phones; I use Motorola Atrix and Samsung Galaxy 2.  d] Remote computer/laptop.  You can use web viewer on local intranet, to see cameras anywhere in your home (set to lower resolution, and slower frame rate, or it can slow down other network traffic if always left on).  Worked well with MS Explorer browser, didn't work with Firefox browser. Webviewer is quick and easy to use.  e] Outside Internet.  Powerful software (included), allows viewing, recording, and control from anywhere in the world.  You should have a Fixed IP address for this, (my ISP - Internet service provider - charges more for fixed IP, than for dynamic IP addresses that change).  DVR can send you email if it gets an alarm trigger or detects motion in the camera.3. Recording:Many options;  you can record on demand by pushing buttons, or set to always record (you select resolution and frame rate, to extend the recordable time before disk fills up),  or record when motion is detected (you have option of saving a few seconds before, and seconds or minutes after an event), record when external alarm inputs triggered,  Record when motion is detected in only a specific portion of the camera view (programmable), and more...  You can record (or copy to) external USB devices, to extend recording time.4. Playback:Nice options, to search for a specific time, or event.  Good friendly user interface.5. Instructions:Although they first seem Long, and complicated;  they are actually too short and not informative enough.  This is a complicated full featured DVR system, with many-many options;  expect to spend a lot of time (days) reading the manual, and experimenting, if you want to use all the features and setup remote network viewing.  If you just want to view cameras live, and record and playback from a monitor on the DVR, then it is fairly fast to setup.6. Cameras  a] Indoor dome SED-1001R:  The indoor dome cameras are less expensive; but hard to point and align (3 adjustments). If you want to look down, you can mount on ceiling, if you want to look across the room, best to mount on the wall (range of motion is too limited).  b] Outdoor camera without sound; two types: small round unit with limited night vision; and larger (square with rounded corners) with better night vision and better bracket.  I bought the later (SEB-1005R), and am happy with them.  I like the white color.  They appear sturdy and well built. There are conflicting reviews on the resolution, note that since these are wide angle lenses, so you see a wide view at a distance; this means that things close to the camera appear large and sharp, while things far from the camera appear tiny and are not clearly resolved;  The camera resolution is fine for a wide angle lens.  c] Outdoor with sound, SEB-1006R:  for ~$10 more, it is nice to add sound.  These are also useful indoors, (sound helps tell a  more complete story).  Note that although the cameras are weather resistant for outdoor use, they should be used under a roof, not out in direct rain.  Don't mount above a dryer vent exhaust, or the camera steams up.  d] Wireless, SEB-1004RW:  has fewer frames per second. Sound is clearer than other cameras.  Good for mounting where cables are hard to run (I ran the cable halfway toward the camera, so the wireless receiving station distance was closer to the transmitting camera).  Once the receiver and camera are paired, they stayed paired after power cycle (this is nice).  Receiver can be powered from Cat-5e network cable, or from 12V transformer (both were included, only one is needed).  Camera can be viewed from either the DVR main monitor (DVR connected by network cable to receiver), or on a small standalone RCA monitor connected directly to the output on the receiver;  the wireless receiver can drive both displays at the same time if you wish.  e] BNC connections:  You have the option to drive 2 of the 8 camera inputs from BNC cables, with RCA audio inputs, if you want to use other older cameras.  f] Night vision:  The infrared LEDs are bright, and reach out a long distance; unfortunately, they are in a narrow spot beam pattern, while the camera is wide angle;  so they only light up the center 10% of the screen.  If something moves past the center of the camera, you can see it OK; but if you want to see motion on the sides, the IR is useless.  I have most of my cameras near outdoor lights (porch & driveway lamps) and the night vision is very good when the extra lighting is on. (Don't put too close to porch light, or it attracts bugs and spiders, which set off motion detection).  During daytime (or bright light) the cameras have a color picture, when it gets dark (camera has light sensor) the camera switches to black and white display, and turns on the IR lights in the camera (IR LEDs are very dim red color when you look at the camera with your eyes, but the electronic display picks up IR light nicely).  g] Cables:  60 foot cables are included with each camera.  Cat-5 cables (unshielded twisted pairs, on all 8 pins) for computer networks also work well, if you want longer or shorter runs.  h] Soltech sold this kit to me, if you call them they allow you to swap out and upgrade any cameras in the standard kits, for a small extra fee.7. Installation:Hooking up the cameras isn't hard (but running wires neatly can take a while).  There are a lot of cables and external power supplies connected to the back, so your cabinet/shelf will need lots of room; (I need about 9 inches between back of DVR and back wall of cabinet)8. Fan noise:This is horrible, worst part of the system.  Very noisy and annoying, will ruin the quiet of your living room.  Worse than any computer (of more than 20) I've used in the past 30 years.  a]  I placed acoustic foam on inner walls of cabinet, cut sound by 3 dB (noticeable improvement, but still noisy).  Auralex 1'x1'x2\" wedge panels works nice.  b] I swapped out the noisy fan (Big improvement, 8db reduction measured 12 inches from font of box).  This is easy to do (see picture I uploaded of inside of box).  I used a Sunon HA40201VA-000U-999 Super Silence fan for $4.33 sold at Digi-Key;  which is long life (60K hrs, has bearings), similar RPM (4700), lower current draw (.046A, this is good), Same airflow (5.5 CFM), same Voltage (DVR supplies 12V), and lower noise (12.8 dB(A) for new fan, compared to 26.8 dB(A) for original noisy Protechnic MG14012LB-215 fan), same size (40x40mm opening), and a depth that fits in the chassis (20mm, vs 15mm original fan, required using longer screws to mount).  Adding felt around the fan also helped a tiny bit.  c] A caution: Don't buy a cheap underpowered replacement fan, you should use a fan with sufficient air flow, such as the one I used above; most cheap quiet fans also have much reduced airflow;  (nor would I recommend adding a 60 Ohm series resistor to original fan that cuts both noise and air flow).  And don't block air floor with doors or foam. The instruction manual has graphs showing that increased temperature drastically decreases product life.9. Over-all:I'm happy with the system.  After you get it set up, it is fun to use, (and I spend way-more time watching the camera monitor than I thought I would).  I purchased extra cameras and monitors to see all parts of my house, from several rooms.  I would buy this again, and would recommend this Samsung system (as long you swap out the noisy fan, or place the DVR in a place where you don't care about the audio noise level).", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for the money.", "Author": "Charles Rivers", "ReviewID": "R1RYU4G5K5YSL4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the money spent, this system is great.
