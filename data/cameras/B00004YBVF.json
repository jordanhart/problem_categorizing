Others have complained about battery life with this cam, i bought a pack of 9 volt batteries from radioshack, and have taken over 150 pictures (mix of flash and no flash) with the first battery, and its still going strong. the picture quality is not stunning, its less than a disposable camera, but for the price and what its meant for its fine. if you want your pictures to look like film photographs look elsewhere. the software that comes with this camera is a little cumbersome, but it is servicable.when i want a nice picture, i use my old om-1 and tamron lense. when my cats are being real cute, i snap them with my jamcam.", "Date": "March 22, 2001"}, {"Title": "Pretty Cool", "Author": "Rebecca Mellor", "ReviewID": "R2RWN5WRHTAXBE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hi. I'm 14 and I got a JamCam for Christmas. It isn't exactly the best possible quality digital camera, but it takes pretty good pictures for the price. I would recommend it for amatures and for anyone who just wants to take some pictures for fun. Another thing that I found, however, was that to take a really good picture inside or anywhere you would probably want to use the flash. Otherwise the picture will come out a little fuzzy. So I just wanted to recommend this camera and give a bit of advice. It was one of the best gifts I got this year.

An excellent camera for kids: they can shoot all the shots they want without the expense or time delay of film processing.  It was a big hit at my daughters birthday party.  The indoor flash worked great and the bundled software allows image manipulation like swaping heads and putting the subject of one picture into the background of another. - Hint for Mac users: it requires OS 8.5.1 or newer (8.5 wouldn't work).", "Date": "December 18, 2000"}, {"Title": "Better than I expected", "Author": "Skllbns", "ReviewID": "R1PEG54JEYZD05", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera basically for taking snapshots that I could email to friends and incorporate into digital home movies edited on iMovie.  I purchased a 32 MB MMC card and can shoot 130 pictures with it.  I got the camera right before the Christmas holidays and probably shot 400-500 pictures in ten days.  Of that number, about 25% were overexposed, too dark, blurred, or weirdly pixilated.  The rest of the pictures came out suprisingly clear, and I ended up keeping about 100 really good snapshots (and didn't have to pay $$$ for film processing).  For a toy camera marketed to email-savvy teens, I'm pretty impressed.  The software package and USB connection couldn't be easier to use (except when you download 130 pictures onto your computer, it requires a huge amount of memory).

It is for the low end market and it surpasses what you should get for the price! This is way better than I expected for a cheap camera.  I bought mine specifically for photos on Ebay and it has surpassed my expectations compared to what people told me I would get.  In part because of its simple to use software.  I download a photo, use the zoom feature and then crop it and I have a great, clearly visible shot.  Sometimes a shot will look grainy depending on how close you were to the object. You can't get super close shots because it doesn't have a macro mode or zoom lens.  But for the price it rules above all other cameras under $100!  I'll stack this up against any other one out there.  As for the people who complained, the common theme was eating batteries which seems to be a case by case scenario.  I get over 100 shots per Duracell, and I've taken close to 500 shots. Many other reviewers claimed either terrible battery life or great longevity.  Maybe you just get a good one or a really bad one?  So take it back and try again!  IMPORTANT: The customer service is outstanding!!!!  And worth the price of the camera alone.

I can't imagine anyone wanting to email or print pictures from the Jamcam3.0 let alone use the special effects to frame them.

Since I use Windows 2000, I had a small problem getting the camera to work initally (a problem installing the software). A call to KB Gear's tech support solved the problem. Unlike most \"tech support\" calls, this one was actually answered by a REAL PERSON who ACTUALLY KNEW how to solve the problem (and I didn't have to wait on hold, either!). I give KB Gear's tech support a SOLID FIVE STARS. As far as the performance of the camera itself, I would say it is fair. Not poor, not good, just fair. The camera doesn't handle low light situations well (even with the flash). The camera seems to have a very low number of bits per pixel. Although the camera shoots at 640 x 480, each pixel seems to be (my guess) 4 or 5 bit color depth. This causes the image to seem grainy. The TWAIN driver included with the camera is not very mature and it crashed a few times. The camera draws power from the 9 volt battery at an amazing rate. By the time you get the software installed, shoot up a few test pictures and download them to the computer, you will need a new battery. In conclusion, if you just want to shoot quick pictures for your online auctions, this camera is fine. It's also fine as a kids camera.

First is the new, lowered price; real digital cameras at such a nice price are quite a development! The applications this camera seems best suited to are: e-mailing photos, webpage posting or limited photo printing (4\" x 6\" max), as in school papers or nonprofessional grade work reports. The resolution is up to these tasks, but not much more. It has no zoom lens, which limits its usefulness. It does have a good indoor flash, and it has an expandable memory (MultiMediaCards, generally harder to find & a bit higher cost than other memory formats). The camera will download into the PC via USB (forget about painfully slow serial port options), but the only way to fly is to use a separate MMC card reader (a little more $, but no battery use and much better speed).

The Jam Cam was my next purchase and what a difference!

I recommend giving it a real good workout when you first get it to familiarize yourself with them so you can still return it if those limitations are just too much.  1. OK -- it eats batteries.  The expensive, high-quality,alkaline 9-volt kind at $3.50 a pop.  You can't use rechargeables at all and it doesn't even stop to chew the cheap ones from walgreen's. A $10 AC battery replacer for downloading is a no-brainer.  2. The flash is overkill - to avoid washed out pictures use the timed exposure when working close.  3. Too dark, too light will get the paint-by-numbers look.  4. The viewfinder in mine was a little off from the picture.  Too  bad an lcd just ain't gonna happen for under $100.  5. One undocumented feature is that it doesn't use all kinds of multi-media cards - only those with negative logic so you're pretty much stuck with SanDisc & can't shop around for the best price.  6.Did I mention it was the best you could get at the price?", "Date": "May 18, 2001"}, {"Title": "Solid camera at a great price", "Author": "Sir Bowen", "ReviewID": "R36D9R9HIAWS5K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's always great to find a product where the maker keeps the price down by omitting features rather than by cutting corners on quality.Sure, this camera isn't super-high-resolution, nor does it have many extra features.

It looks like a real camera, not a toy. The menu-based controls on the back of the camera are easy to use (one criticism is that it is fairly easy to accidentally clear the camera's memory if you're not careful.) The camera is very sensitive to slight jiggling and will give blurry pictures if you don't hold it extremely still. My biggest complaint is that the viewfinder is poor and gives a very inaccurate preview of what you're shooting. I like the fact that it uses a single 9-volt battery for ease of loading, instead of 4 AAs. The battery wears out quickly, although the camera complains that the battery is dead when there is enough juice left for several more pictures. Use a rechargeable if you have one. The camera's built-in light sensor sometimes allows you to get good pictures and low light situations--other times you will need to use the built-in flash. Fortunately, experimenting with a digital camera is cheap. The pictures are somewhat inferior in quality to a digital camera that was included with an Internet service provider subscription, but the Jamcam's built-in flash is more reliable--the other camera's flash stopped functioning after a few pix. The choice of two resolution modes seems like a nice added feature, but the lower resolution is of such poor quality as to be almost unusable for anything but quick emails. A nice feature is the upgradeability with an expansion card. The best thing about the JamCam is it is one of only a very few starter cameras that works with a Mac. The downloading software is not bare bones and works nicely. The included Adobe PhotoDeluxe editing software is a capable addition and adds considerable value to this camera, if you don't already have a similar program. The Jamcam software connects you to the Jamcam website, which has worked out agreements with Shutterfly.com to print your pictures and a free web host to post them for the world to see. Sometimes you will be very disappointed with the way this camera's pictures turn out, other times you will be pleasantly surprised--if you don't have unrealistic expectations to begin with.", "Date": "January 21, 2002"}, {"Title": "Be forwarned", "Author": "\"maxxwwedge\"", "ReviewID": "R34DQ14L248DIT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Camera worked great-when it worked, which was for approximately 4 months.

There's no preview screen, and you can't delete bad shots. It eats through batteries like wildfire. The images aren't stored in a standard format, so you can only download them through the camera, not through a MMC reader. Now that wouldn't be so bad, but unfortunately, the JamCam software is quite unstable and crashes often during the download, which means that if you have more than about 40 images on one card, you'll never manage to get them out.

I didn't want to bother with unloading the software, decided to \"take my chances\", and continued with the Windows XP upgrade.

A year after purchasing a JamCam 3 - these are a bargain at Amazon's $49.99 price. A great intro to digital photography. Few sub-$100 cams have built-in flash, and PC as well as *Mac* USB support. Here's my best tips after owning one of these the past year:Steady Freddie! A steady hand, a gentle push of the button will improve sharpness. Digital image sensors are slow compared to chemical film.Quality 9V batteries (Duracell or Energizer) make all the difference. _Rechargable_ NiMh (not NiCAD!) will quickly pay for the battery and charger _if you look carefully and get one that outputs 8+ volts_ (Eveready Ultra) rather than most other \"9v\" models which only output an inadequate 7.2v.The supplied Jam app's default sharpening setting best; leave it alone, but do experiment with the lighting settings _before_ importing your pics. The Flash/Indoor/Outdoor/Etc buttons DO affect the image brightness _as it is imported_. Use the Jam supplied app ONLY to transfer - find a better 3rd party graphics app for more control over the final image.San-Disk is the only recommended MMC card brand. You cannot use a USB card-reader (as some reviewers imply) because the JamCam does not store pics in a standard 'disk-like format'. Choose a 16mb or less module for faster writes and better battery life than a large one. Don't be tempted to get more pics with the lo-res 320x240 setting. You'll only grab more dissapointment. Stick with the hi-res setting.Teach yourself or your kids the basics of good photography. Not a point and shoot mentality - but Point. STOP. LOOK. ADJUST, LOOK AGAIN - then Shoot. Compose your image, move in on your subject, analyze lighting for shadows and highlights.

I WOULD recommend this (with a 28 MB memory card) for a younger person just learning photography, or someone like me that 2 years ago could not afford anything else!!!", "Date": "April 25, 2004"}, {"Title": "love the camera but help!", "Author": "lesley", "ReviewID": "R2GOG3X762OZ9X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i was given this camera as a xmas present and love it.it is so easy to use and is great for the computer......i have one problem now......plse could someone tell me what is going wrong.when i am downloading my pictures onto the computing i keep getting the error code 5er.....the pictures will not download now...plse could somebody help i miss my camera!!!", "Date": "January 15, 2004"}, {"Title": "Not worth the trouble", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1DZYW4HYCY84J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera with the idea that I could get some \"quick & dirty\" shots when I want to email a photo to friends or family.
