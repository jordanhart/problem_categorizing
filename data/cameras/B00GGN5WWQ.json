Camera bag is pretty good. memory card is top of the line.The camera itself..The zoom feature in Video mode is awesome. With the 55-250 lens you definitely need a tripod. (Zooms in way more in video mode than just photo mode) From what I can see this feature is not available in the next model up.One drawback, no autofocus in video mode.  As far as I can see you have to auto focus before you start the video, or you can manually focus thruout the video. (I understand next model up can auto-focus in video mode)Camera with the 55-250 lens is very light (Compared to my old 35mm SLR) but does not feel cheap.Battery life (with double battery grip) appears more than enough for normal use. On a 5 hr hiking trip, camera was on all the time and took about 400 pictures, batteries were still pretty well charged up. Plus with the battery grip you get a second battery pack that holds 6 AA batteries. Great to keep that as a back up. (Doubt if I will ever use it)Overall we are very happy with it and am in the market for a second one (possibly used) and am already  eyeing the 400mm 5.6 Canon lens.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$824.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 15 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Canon EOS Rebel T3i Digital SLR Camera Body & EF-S 18-55mm IS II Lens + <2> Canon EF-S 55-250mm STM Lens + <3> Zeikos BG-E8 Battery Grip +\n<4> Transcend 32GB SDHC 300x Card + <5> Spare LP-E8 Battery + <6> 58mm UV Filter + <7> Additional 58mm UV Filter +\n<8> PD Digital SLR Camera Case + <9> Precision Design DSLR300 Flash + <10> RC-6 Shutter Remote Control + <11> Precision Design 58\" Tripod +\n<12> LCD Screen Protectors + <13> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <14> PD 8 SD Card Memory Card Case + <15> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T3i Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm IS II & 55-250mm IS STM Lens with 32GB Card + Case + LED Flash + Grip + Battery + Tripod Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61Zja8ZhOHL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GGN5WWQ"}}
