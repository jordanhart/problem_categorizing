{"Reviews": [{"Title": "500, 550, 600, 630, 700, 800, 900: Which is \"the one\"?", "Author": "Samuel Chell", "ReviewID": "R4Q6RVSA9TVAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Even though my SD110 seemed indestructible, it couldn't match the size and nimbleness of the new generation of Elves, so it was time for a replacement.With under a hundred bucks separating the first five models, a consumer might well be in a minor dither about which to get.  Currently most Amazon consumers are bucking the adage \"newer is better\" and going with the SD600 (which the tech people at Cnet support, giving it a rating identical to or higher than the slightly larger and heavier SD700 and recent SD800 and SD900, both with Digic III processors).  Perhaps their thinking is like mine: first, its dimensions (width, depth, and height) are smaller and its weight  (under 5 oz) lighter than the other six models (the 500's are the largest, and the 630, in fact, is a bit of an oxymoron: a bigger screen to accommodate failing eyes but tighter and tinier controls for those same eyes to locate and navigate); second, the 600 is the only one of the seven that maintains the original Canon Elph aesthetic of perfectly square angles at all corners of the camera (the contoured look that Canon is beginning to introduce is, I confess, a slight offense to my eye).  Finally, in the category of set-up time for the first and each subsequent shot, the 600 is comparable in speed with the other models, rated a nano-second behind the 800 but better than the 900.  Moreover, the price at this time is right (though don't expect this model to be around much longer).  If you can live with a \"mere\" 6 megapixels and shoot with a sufficiently steady hand to ignore the absence of the 700's image stabilizer feature this may very well be \"the one\" for you.  (Not for an eternity, but in our world of rapidly changing technology even an \"extended honeymoon\" of several years has to be considered equivalent to a lasting marriage.)If it needs a further recommendation, my botanist son-in-law, who owns an SD500, is about to order a supply of the smaller and lighter 600's to put in the hands of his students in the field.Postscript: Contrary to a later reviewer's claim, this camera does not have an \"anti-shake\" feature like the SD700.  I've never had a problem with shaky pictures, but should you observe jittery images, try shooting through the viewfinder for a firmer grip (which is lacking, by the way on the SD630).  As for a 6 megapixel lens vs. a higher number, only the sharpest eye would detect any difference in quality of resolution--and even then it would have to be an image blown up to wallpaper size.  Finally, the cost of SD memory cards has come down by 50% in just the past several months, so it makes sense to go for the larger (1 GB) card.  Also, I would spend the extra fifteen bucks for the faster speed of the Sandisk Ultra II card. (If you like to check the results of a shot the instant after exposure or if you transfer large numbers of shots to your computer at the same time, you'll notice a difference).  If you're content with a conventional SD card and want to save a few additional bucks, go with Kingston (as good as Sandisk, in my experience, though I'd stay clear of Lexar, which has given me trouble).", "Date": "October 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "A week in Boston - 400+ photos and not a bad one in the bunch!", "Author": "Donn Young", "ReviewID": "RL3GKGCAPRQHH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third - and possibly final - digital camera. It does everything superbly and in a size I can just throw in my pocket so it's always there. Before the SD600 I had a Canon S100 2.1 mp [a great camera] and a Sony DSC-W1 5.1 mp [a piece of $%#@ - every other image blurry].With the Sony less than a year old, I couldn't put up with it anymore - it was time to go back to Canon so I wouldn't miss any future shots. I got the SD600 at Best Buy 1 day before leaving on a week-long trip to Boston. My 10-yr old daughter was studying the Revolutionary War in school so I was told to take a lot of photos and \"Dad, make sure they aren't blurry like all those others.\" [She's got the old S100, so she's not worried].Since I'd already had the old S100, the controls were familiar. Best Buy had a 1GB PNY SD chip on sale for $39, so I had room for over 500 photos, plus I picked up an extra battery.In the week in Boston I shot day, night, flash, long exposure, high light, low light, drizzle, rain, sun, and even a short video of Morris dancers in Boston Common. Every shot was great - and not one blurry, even when the 'shaking hand' was on. I'm not sue that the image stabilization with the SD700 would be all that necessary.I found that indoors [my greatest fear since the Sony made you worry about every shot] with reasonably good lighting I was able to turn the flash off and shoot with natural light. I've not yet had the time to play with the various modes - just straight turn it on and shoot [both of which were very quick with minimal delay].Everyone we were with were greatly impressed by the 600's size, style, and images on the LCD - and surprised to see me turn it on end to show full screen portrait format shots [very cool]. Even friends with the SD450 [my Christmas recommendation] wanted to trade theirs in.I was able to get over 150 shots - maybe a quarter with flash - without recharging [I just stuck the little spare in the coin pocket in my jeans and didn't worry about it].The software's great, too. I used the old ZoomBrowser EX with the Sony, so it was nice to see this updated and much more functional. I might not have to use Irfan Skiljan's IrfanView package anymore.I'm sure that over the summer I'll find all those bells and whistles to be entertaining, but for just taking pictures, I don't think there's anything more I'd ever want. Now if I can just find someone to take the Sony... and I'll throw in my old Omega D2 enlarger for free!The SD600 is as close to perfect as you can get and all I'll ever need.", "Date": "May 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great quality with a lot of versatility", "Author": "T. Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R2QPEPVWEMTINO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Funny how this camera seems to be tested in Boston. I bought this camera specifically for a trip to Boston. I thought my brother's SD450 was the best  digital camera I've ever used, until I got the SD600.I took TONS of pictures in different lighting and all turned out great. I shot everything from plates of food inches away to soccer games with players clear across the field.Certain settings worked better than others for different lighting situations. It really just depends on what color tones you prefer.  I prefer warmer tones and the camera worked really well. For the basic point-and-shoot shots with the setting on automatic and flash, I thought the colors were very true to life.The video feature is really great as well.  Playback is amazing on the large LCD screen.  The newer version of this camera (SD630) has a larger display of 3inches but I actually prefer my 2.5inch screen. THis is because when I tried out the SD630, I'd get finger prints on the screen just trying to manuever the buttons.  I don't have this problem w/ the SD600.  I am able to avoid touching the screen while changing the settings on my camera.The best thing about this camera is that it is ready almost instantly after you turn it on. No waiting for an annoying flash to warm up. It also takes a picture right away when you press the button. Hardly a delay compared to other digital cameras.I don't have much else to add to this review that hasn't been already addressed. This camera with its numerous settings is far better than any old point-and-shoot camera. I think it's a great compromise  between a professional camera and a point-and-shoot. It's quite versatile for those who like to play around with settings and effects. For the price, this camera rocks. 3 people have already been convinced into buying this camera after seeing me use it.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Pictures Great Price", "Author": "teksp0rt \"teksp0rt\"", "ReviewID": "R7R20H8N3S2DP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing a lot of research online I decided on a Canon Powershot SD600. So far this camera has met every expectation I had for a ultra-compact segment camera. The pictures are crisp and colors vivid. Also, the shutter speed is pretty quick so you wont miss a shot becuase of lag time.The next model up from this is the Powershot SD630. The SD630 has a larger LCD but I don't really see the advantage over the SD600. The picture quality is the same and you lose the view finder due to the larger LCD.", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Small!  Great pictures and video!  But no RAW?", "Author": "B. T. Denyer \"UX Designer\"", "ReviewID": "R1X7O1WFA49JMQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I was amazed at how small it is, and then by its beautiful screen.  After only being able to shoot 6 pictures with the supplied SD card I ordered and installed a Transcend 2GB SD 150x card, giving me an estimated 1.9+ gigs of storage - it works flawlessly in the SD600.  This card allows me to take over 680 \"Large\" images at 2816 x 2112 pixels in Superfine mode (least amount of file compression).  Or over 17,000 images in the \"Small\" image (640 x 480 pixels) and high compression mode.  You should EASILY find a place in bewteen to suit your needs.I didn't realize this until today, but the SD600 DOES NOT take RAW image captures.  On page 20 of the camera's User Guide it shows the icon for RAW and states that the RAW icon \"may also be displayed with some images.\"  NOWHERE in the User Guide does it mention how to capture images in RAW, nor does the menu give the ability to change it out of JPEG.  In the back of the User Guide the Data Type for still images is \"Exif 2.2 (JPEG)\"  NO mention of any other format or adjustment available.Other than that, the camera takes amazing pictures.  Macro works beautifully and can be used at 1.2 inches to 1.6 feet from the subject.Note that all of the shiney 'chrome-like' pieces on the camera (shutter button, zoom wheel, lanyard loop, battery/memory door, USB door...) are PLASTIC!  Not metal like the rest of the camera.  If you are prone to dropping your camera you might want to take into account that practically one entire corner of this camera is plastic.  I recommend the Canon leather pouch - it fits perfectly with this camera and is of better quality than other name brand protective pouches.No need for an extra battery; I have yet to see the need for one.  If you are going on a long trip away from a power source...  maybe, but it really does last a long time.  (From the manual:) LCD on = 160 images, LCD off = 600 images, Playback time = approx 4 hours.  Just turn off all of the extra sounds and unnecessary stuff and you should be able to squeeze some extra time out of this battery.  NOTE: unlike other devices that are on the market these days, this camera DOES NOT charge the battery while plugged into a USB port.  And you have to remove the battery in order to charge it - the ONE thing I enjoyed not having to do with my last camera.I also HIGHLY recommend an LCD screen protector for this camera.  Be sure to get one that specifically states that it fits your LCD screen, or else you wil have to cut it to fit... what a pain.  You won't be sorry that you spent the $3-10 for the little piece of plastic.With this product I also HIGHLY recommend the Joby GP1-01P Gorillapod Flexible Tripod!  You will be amazed by this little tripod, just search Amazon for it and check out the product pictures!", "Date": "August 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Almost Perfect...", "Author": "The Truth", "ReviewID": "R3LX4SS4UQTWLT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In the search for the ultimate ultracompact digital camera Ive owned the Sony T9, the Olympus 720sw, and the Canon SD600. Of the three, the Canon SD600 comes the closest to being the \"ultimate ultracompact digital camera\". Read on to find out why it still falls short of true perfection...(If you are interested in reading reviews of the other two cameras feel free to check my profile).Pros:* Excellent Image quality (best of the three Ive owned)* Excellent build quality and very ultracompact* Allows manual shooting and auto. Good lowlight photography.* Excellent movie mode (60 fps)* Very reasonably priced (I got mine for $309)Cons:* Very few \"fun\" features (no titleing, weak slideshow, no calendar feature)Conclusion:If you are looking for a compact digital camera that takes excellent photos while still being ultra-portable, the Canon SD600 has the best of both worlds, truly. Although both the Olympus 720sw and the Sony T9 have many \"fun\" features to spice up your photography, you will be sacrificing a bit in image quality. But for the everyday photographer that just wants to shoot great photos and doesnt care for the gimmicky features then youve found yourself a true slice of perfection.", "Date": "May 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera, BUT...", "Author": "Bradley Olin", "ReviewID": "R29KLAUZ3P4AAT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have now been fortunate enough to own several digital cameras, including a Nikon KoolPix 500, which was a 3.1MP camera released in 2000, and up until recently I had a Nikon D70 DSLR.First of all, this is a great point and shoot camera.  There are plenty of features which cater to all manner of users, from the avid professional, to an amateur with limited knowledge of camera features and functions.  The camera is compact, durable, and feels small but solid in my hands.  6.1 MP is more than adequate to produce high quality images, and since I usually don't print beyond 8.5x11\", there's no need to invest in the 7+ MP cameras.Battery life is decent, but I recommend keeping a few spares if you will be on long trips without access to a place to charge up.  NOTE: There is no battery indicator on the camera, which is frustrating if you only have the stock battery provided by Canon.  The only battery info that the camera will provide is a red flashing battery symbol when it's about to die.  That's not much help.  My advice is to charge up the battery before any extended use, just to make sure you'll get the maximum number of shots.  It loses a star for this; it's just a real pain, and it's a shame they overlooked such a simple, but helpful feature.Everything else is pretty much great.  Nice clear 2.5\" LCD view screen, optical viewfinder.  Images get a little shaky when you go into digital zoom, but that's the nature of the beast.  If you're really concerned about camera shake and blurry images, either don't use the digital zoom feature, or opt for a pricier camera with an image stabilizing option.", "Date": "December 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Perfect camera for me", "Author": "Danielle", "ReviewID": "R1FE6TNJ3X12VV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received this camera and could not be happier. I did tons of research before buying, and this one is definitely the one for me! My knowledge of electronics is average, and I am having tons of fun with this. Here's what I like about the camera:- It's Small & very thin (And although it's small, it feels suprisingly sturdy)- Stylish & attractive- Large LCD screen (2.5 inches)- Many different shooting modes (Has settings for indoor, outdoor, kids & pets, foliage, etc.)- Transferring pictures from the camera to the computer is a breeze- And most importantly, it takes beautiful, clear pictures, and is fun to use!I am thrilled with this camera. The only thing is that the 16MB memory card it comes with is a little ridiculous, considering that it can only hold a few (6 or 7 at the most) pictures on it. I did know when I was buying that the card is very small, so I ordered a 2gig card in addition. I just thought I'd include that for anyone who did not know. Also, I recommend purchasing a spare battery to have on hand since the camera doesn't have a constant battery life reminder on the screen (the battery life meter only pops up on the screen when there is 1/3 of the battery life left)If you are looking for the features I mentioned in the list above, then I say go get this camera, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.UPDATE 7/20: I just returned from a 10-day trip to Greece and this camera held up very very nicely. I took 600+ pictures that turned out fantastic and the camera was very easy to travel with. This was my first real test for the camera's performance and it passed with flying colors!", "Date": "July 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "SD600 is welcome addition to the Elph family", "Author": "Omar Siddique", "ReviewID": "R240CYE9F1NTG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've happily been using Canon Elph digital cameras for years; my 3 month old SD600 is the fourth model I've owned and I'm pleased to report that the product line continues as strongly as before.Since lots of reviews here speak to the camera in general, I will compare the camera to the previous model in its niche, the SD400/450.  The SD600, versus the SD400/450 has:- 6MP vs 5MP.- An added ISO speed (800), and a dedicated ISO button to switch modes.- More shooting modes (variations of color-balance/etc for snow, beaches, etc).- A bigger LCD than the SD400 (2.5\" vs 2.0\").  Same size as the SD450.- Controls that are a bit better laid out.- The camera is lighter despite all the new features (by about 25% according to the specs).- Unlimited length video (up to your SD card capacity), rather than time limited.- Much improved software that is easier to use and fuller featured (the new version can be downloaded for older cameras from Canon's website).I've shot extensive video and taken 600-700 photos with this camera since I've had it, and I'm very happy with its performance.  Like most small cameras this size, red-eye in flash photos is still a problem, as is camera shake when taking flashless photos at high ISOs, but these issues are not unique to the Elph.  The only quibble I have with this camera specifically is that it still ships with a measly 16MB SD card, Canon should have upgraded this to at least a 32MB considering how cheap they are and how big 6MP photos are.Highly recommended.", "Date": "June 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great ultracompact", "Author": "Wyobookman", "ReviewID": "R3KZWCH8DM0F2H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this great little camera almost two weeks ago and have enjoyed every minute of use. I bought it to sort of replace my 3 year-old Canon A80, which was getting left home more and more because of its bulk. I travel a lot and wanted a quality ultracompact that would take pictures of the same caliber (or better) as my A80, but be much more pocket-friendly. I considered a number of cameras: Canon SD4xx/5xx/6xx, Sony's T series, Casio's Z series, and Panasonic's FX01. I went with the SD600 for its photo quality, build, optical viewfinder, and being the Goldilocks for size: not too big, not too small, just right.Thoughts so far:The SD600 is has a nice little heft to it but is not too heavy, and felts like it's been machined out one piece of metal. For such a small device it feels nice and solid in hand, and one-handed operation is comfortable. The case is a little on the slippery side. I see I'll have to be carefull with battery/card cover: it's the one thing that feels delicate. The buttons are large enough for my average-sized male hands.The camera starts up very quickly, and shutter lag is negligible under most conditions. Turning off the nine-point autofocus (AiFA), which leaves on the centered AF, speeds things up a little. Flash is strong in the center of the shot, but regardless of zoom, weak on the sides. Fleshtones on the whole are rendered warm and natural, but again, it can be a little harsh in the center. Redeye is present as often as not, but it's better than I expected. The flash cycles fairly quickly with a charged battery. Battery life is OK: about 140 shots in fine mode, some flash use, and heavy LCD use. Thank you Canon for making a small flat charger whose prongs fold flat!While this ELPH's LCD is not stunning like some of its competitors, resolution and brightness are satisfactory in all but the harshest sunlight. Bearing in mind this is an ultracompact, the viewfinder is decent and a reason why I chose this over the SD630, Casios, and Sonys.I am very pleased with the photos this little guy is delivering. There're enough scene modes, and the automatic settings produce consistent results. The camera's manual controls are somewhat limited, but it is a point-and-shoot after all. Still, there's enough manual control to improve on the some of the auto modes and get more shots. I've found the white balance modes rather useless but surprisingly have had better and even more natural results using the special color modes. In the auto modes, colors are nicely saturated and accurately rendered. Focus time seems about average. Autofocus with or without AiAF is precise, so images are crisp without looking 'hard.' Contrast and detail are very good. In the 4x6's and 5x7's I've printed out, I'm sure a trained eye would see some issues, but what counts is that my eye is delighted with the results.In making up my mind, video quality was not a consideration. After playing around with it though, I like what I see on the LCD, but I don't have enough experience with video to comment one way or another.This Canon is the best compromise for me: excellent photos, solid construction, and very pocket- and travel-friendly. Battery life could be better. That's true of alot of electronic products, but I can live with it because the battery charger is very compact. All in all, this camera has met my expectations and has not disappointed me at all. In fact, it's been a lot of fun to use and play around with, which I think is much of the point of this class of camera. And I'm capturing photos I never would've bothered to get with a larger camera.

Another thing is the labels on the camera (the icons/labels on the buttons of the camera) get rubbed off after a while and so you dont know what button you need to press to access some of the features.

Apparently our 6 year old Olympus that required three hands to hold and a building permit when set on a tripod was becoming a little too much to handle.  Although she would have settled for something in the sub $100 range that was powered by a running hamster, I wanted something that was going to be small and powerful.  Enter the SD600.After using old technology for so long, I am amazed at the quality of the images taken by such a small camera.  The 2.5 inch LCD screen is also an incredible asset.  Another major plus is the addition of the viewfinder.  For steady shots, I have always held a digital camera to my eye.  The viewfinder's presence here is truly appreciated.Outside of the ease of operation and menu functionality are some of the added image features.  The color swap and accent modes are a lot of fun.  Although you are not aware of it, they will probably bring out the artsy side of you that was previously undiscovered.On the negative side, the zoom is not very powerful and the camera can be pricey if you have to add another $50-$70 for a new SD memory card.

I was searching for a small camera with manual features and this camera was a perfect fit. Aside from the manual features (shutter speed, white balance etc) this camera has a lot of surprising bonuses. Things that are not mentioned in most of these reviews. A few of those include...While viewing your pictures, or sharing with friends, you can view them as a slide show (you even have the ability to include transition fades and wipes). This feature it nice so your friends don't have to bump around, searching for the right keys. Or if you want to share them with a group of friends, you can use the AV cable included to hook straight into your tv.Movies can also be edited and cropped down before uploading onto your computer.Another feature I appreciated was that you can upload images to your windows xp without using their program (though there is a photo program included). I liked having the choice not to install yet another application.My favorite feature is how fast the camera is. As soon as you hit the button the camera is on. Also, I've used a lot of digital cameras that are slow to display images, or have the fuzzy then becomes clear thing. This camera lets you toggle quickly between pictures and the images are crisp.Also, in response to the reviews that complain there is no steady-hand feature. All you need to do is apply the setting HighISO for a quick shutterspeed. Moving items can be caught without the motion streaking.The only cons I have discovered are... that I need to buy a larger memory card. The pics are so high res, you can't fit a lot, however you can change the quality to fit more pictures on the 16mb card.The one other thing is that I wish there was a manual button to retract the lens. The lense retracts after a minute of disuse, but sometimes I want to view right away and I find it uncomfortable viewing with the lense sticking out.I have had many good experiences with canon.

I bought this SD600 Digital Elph for one reason alone:  portability.It's small enough to fit into my shirt or jeans pockets.  It's not a very slim camera, but it's good enough for me.  I don't feel like I'm going to break it when I handle it because it's very solid.I really, really enjoy the large LCD (it's bigger than the LCD on my S2IS).  It's bright and crisp, giving me a very accurate preview of what the full-sized finished photo would look like.  I even like how the preview orientation automatically rotates when you hold the camera horizontally or vertically.A basic set of shooting modes makes it easy and quick to compose shots.  When you're shooting outdoors in city limits (which is what I mostly do with this camera) you need that ease and efficiency.  The refresh rate on this camera is quick - great for those hurry-up situations.  Of course you can also set the shutter to do continuous shots of the same subject when you hold down the shutter button.  With 6MP the photos come out nice and crisp.The only thing that was lacking in this camera is the exposure reading.  I like to keep track of exposure readings for future reference and my S2IS will record all the necessary details.  But the SD600 does not give you the shutter speed and aperture settings for each shot.  I'm willing to forgo this, however, for all of its other perks.As with the S2IS, uploading pictures onto my computer is quick and easy.

It's nothing less than a great camera for the person who is not much into adjusting the blah-blah-blah for getting that perfect photo! Just switch it on and click. The zoom is sufficient and the clarity is real good. I have tried almost all the options except the \"manual\" and the photos are just great with foliage and night shots being the highlight. The foliage shots had a good depth of the colors and the night shots were clear. The only problem I found with night shots was that the flash \"whitenend\" the subject when the subject was less than 10 feet(approximately) away from the lens. Otherwise it was good. Also the photo tends to be \"shaken\" in low light conditions. If you are going to do a lot of shooting in low light conditions, either you need to have one/a pair of steady hands (I try to hold my camera in both my hands for better stabity) or go for one with IS.The battery life is satisfactory and charges pretty fast. Lack of a battery indicator is a sore point. The camera is compact and fits inside almost any pocket on your attire. With an ultra SD card, the snapping is quick. By the way, the SD card that shipped with the camera was a waste. It carries no more than 10 photos at the most. Order a larger SD card along with the camera.To summarize, here are the reasons why you should go for this...- compact and fits palm of your hand- Simple and easy to use- Offers some preset settings to explore and saves you time and effort to adjust a lot of things if you were to use the manual option- And with all these... gives you great picturesReduced the 1 star from the rating 'cos...- no battery indicator. I would not know until its completely dead.- an IS option would have been better- sometimes I feel it is too compact that I have put in effort to grip it tight and hold it steadily (my fingers ache)Overall, go for the camera if you need it for snapping on the go.. ur kids, travel, holidays, events etc. If you are a serious photographer with an \"eye\" for details, this is not the camera for you.

Of course, I am partial to Canons, because I consider them the best!This afternoon, I thought it was time to write a review of my own, however.  After finding a wasps' nest, I felt brave enough to photograph it in macro mode \"up close and personal\".  On my third or fourth shot, the wasps had had enough of this intruder and zoomed in on me, sending me and camera backwards over steps and onto the concrete patio floor... still holding my PowerShot with the wrist strap.  My poor camera bounced across the concrete steps and floor several times before I made it to safety.The battery/memory card cover had snapped off in the process and the camera had powered off.  Oh no, I thought, I'll have to invest in another one.  But wait - the battery cover, although plastic, was unbroken and only needed to be snapped back on.  With that on, the camera was able to power up again!  Joy, joy, everything was working!The end results were a few almost unnoticeable scratches to the front of the camera and four wasp stings to my arm and leg which are swelling as I type, but my SD600 is one tough little gem!

The compact size of the Canon is a real plus and it takes great pictures outside in bright light. The biggest draw back is the quality of the indoor photos in semi bright light or situations requiring the flash. The camera will take photos in semi bright light (a well lit room for example) without automatically flashing, but those photos turn out grainy or not as rich as you'd like. When the flash is used people seem washed out and the back ground gets lost into black or no detail. The same is true of pictures of objects under the same conditions. My wife loves the camera, but I'm not all that impressed. If you are considering this camera, take lots of sample photos at a camera shop before ordering[...].

Oh, and the brand new frail and feeble Canon PowerShot SD600.Oh, it's not a terrible camera. It's inexpensive, the images aren't worse than the s410, the shutter lag is somewhat less ... but I expected more. Yes it's smaller -- but only outside of the case. Put it inside the somewhat bulky case (you wouldn't want to carry this fragile gem any other way) and it's about the same size as the s410 in its case.So the size drop doesn't bring much practical value, but the large display and small size have some unfortunate side-effects. The flash is microscopic and the battery looks too small to power the big display for long. Speaking of the big display, it doesn't leave much room for the almost invisible controls. Yes, the display is nice for doing on camera image review and editing, but we do that on the 20\" iMac display. It's made for consumers who don't use a computer.Maybe it was the lack of space that made Canon remove the mechanical switch between 'Auto' and 'Manual' settings. That hurts. My wife uses auto, I use manual. The switch used to be foolproof, now it requires quirky menu navigation.And so we come back to the build quality. On the one hand the camera has a one year warranty. On the other hand it probably doesn't cover the camera door coming off in your hands. This camera is 'Made in Japan', but evidently that doesn't mean what it once did.  The first time I inserted the SD card it wouldn't pop out again, though it did on a second try.The Digital Elph's had an enviable reputation for solid construction, Canon has tossed that out the window. If I were Canon's CEO I'd be calling for an internal inquiry.A few positives to end with. It still uses a standard mini-B USB connector and Canon's compact and plugless wall charger is as well designed as ever.

Excellent battery life. Photos are terrific. I appreciate the higher ISO (up to 800) which allows more photos to be taken with ambient light and no flash...my prior limit on the S230 was 400 ISO.

If you are interested in using all the special features the camera has to offer, plan on spending at least two hours reading through manual and practicing. The manual is a bit overwhelming.

So, I either have to buy some weird brand of camera here in Peru for three times the price, or not have any photos of Peru at all.

A week after my friend had the E16 lens error, I went to Sydney to go see the Blue mountains. I take one picture of the camp grounds, turn it off, then turn it on 20 minutes later to have this error come up and ruin my trip at sydney. Of course when you are in a place with breathtaking scenery, you are going be be bummed  about not being able to capture those kodak moments.The E16 error is a common error known throughout canon cameras, and I only found out about it after my defect. It is not covered by the warranty because they think its misuse because particles like dust or sand can get in. THEN WHY GIVE A BEACH AUTO FEATURE, DO YOU WANT US TO BREAK OUR CAMERAS?!My question is, how come so many other brands of camera dont get the lens error as common as canon does. 2 of my friends have the same model and theirs broke as well. One shelled out 150 to get it repaired and the other just bought a new camera. Cameras in Australia are very expensive and I bought this before I came here. The camera costs about 200 US when I got it, and the closest replacement was 400AUD, which is about 340 to 350.All I have to say is, the camera is great during its life. But I weary of buying another canon for awhile. I rather go for a brand that may not have the best auto features like color swap and accent, but it at least works past 4 to 12 months.  Even my minolta with a messed up lcd screen is still taking awesome pictures and I had it at the beach forever and this piece of crap dies in 3 months.Definitely staying away from canon, and it sucks cause i loved it when it was useful.", "Date": "June 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera.", "Author": "Mayerlin", "ReviewID": "R1RLMSVUQOURI0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I previously owned the Canon PowerShot SD400 and loved it but I gave it to my husband and decided to get an upgrade for myself.

I settled on the SD600 because of its friendly price and good features and it did not disappoint me. Most of the operations are intuitive and easy to handle, the 6-MP resolution is excellent (up to print-reproduction quality) and the rechargeable battery was an excellent feature. Downloading photos into my computer was quick and easy.I would recommend the SD600 to anyone with similar needs, with the clear understanding that any purchase represents a compromise between price and performance. This camera was exactly what I needed and it did the job. I expect to use it in many situations because of its small size and convenience.My only gripe was the absurdly small (16-meg) memory card that came with it, enough for five high-res photos. I bought a 512 with 200-shot capacity, easy to find even in India, and realized that the razor/blade marketing calculation had been very carefully calibrated by Canon.

I found it helpful to go out and see how the cameras work and see how you like the feel.  It came down to a few models for me - the sony w50, canon a630 and a540 or a530 and the canon sd630 and Nikon L4.  The a530 and a540 I liked but didn't care for the fact they only used 2 AA batteries as they didn't seem they would last too long with the size of the camera and I wanted something that would take better low light shots and maybe something a bit smaller as well.  I liked the price on the nikon L4 but everybody told me to avoid it so I did.  The one I liked the best was the canon a630 but I came to the conclusion that a small 'carry with you everywhere camera' was more the direction I wanted to go so I hesitantly moved my search to the sony w50 and canon sd600.  The sony is a slick camera and pictures were ok but I liked the image quality and feel of the canon better.  I didn't like having to buy the sony duo pro type memory over the sd cards, although people do love the sony and it seems to be a dependable camera.  The sd630 is a nice camera too but I wanted the viewfinder and have already found it usefull and I liked the larger controls on the sd600. Sooo here I am.I was surprised how fast the camera booted up, almost instantaneous.  I bought a 2 gb kingston sd memory card and it performs flawlessly.  I have never downloaded pictures to my computer before but this was a snap, didn't load software just plugged it in and easy from there. I have windows xp.  Movie mode is amazing and I can zoom in and out which I didn't know I could. Took some pictures of furniture I wanted to sell on craigs list and came out excellent.  I didn't use a flash and just have to have some good outside light in the room and good angle.  The flash is a bit strong and wish there was a message board for people who own this camera as we could give each other some shooting tips.

I returned them all and finally spent a little more and got a Canon A95 for $325 and the pictures were wonderful, never disappointed.My A95 is now going on 4 years old, Nothing wrong with it I just wanted to upgraded, and this time I stuck with canon and got the SD600 Elph mainly for its size!! Surprisingly the SD600 cost less then my A95 did and has more MPs. and it takes better pictures then my A95 did, glad I upgraded.But the best thing I like about the SD600 is the Color Accent option!! You zoom in on your child's face skin tone, snap the picture and there face will have all its color but everything behind them is black and white. You don't have to mess with a computer to get the technique. Also snapping picture using Snow and Foliage option gives your pictures wonderful COLOR!!

I have never had to download any software to print picture off my 2 canon cameras. I just plug my canon right to my KODAK!!!!! Printer (Yes different brand printer form my camera and it works) then push the print BUTTON ON THE CAMERA, and the picture comes right out on the printer without using a computer.

It's small, light, and extremely easy to use- perfect to take to the park, family function, or sporting event without being bulked up or weighted down like other cameras make you feel. I like that it has a 2 1/2\" lcd screen that displays beautifully, as well as an optical viewfinder that is a \"must have\" in certain situations. The 3x zoom works well too, and the picture quality is outstanding, way better than the HP, Toshiba, and Kodak I have owned in the past. In addition, the video component is a major plus; one can get a pretty good quality half hour of vid with a 2gb sd card (not included, but I recommend you purchase one along with a spare battery). So in many situations, one does not need to tote the video cam along either. My only knock: no battery meter, but battery life thus far has been very good. In either case, buy the spare, it charges quickly and is inexpensive.Built with a solid outer case, easy-to-use functions, and just enough features to add a little flare to pictures, this camera is definitely the one for you.

When I first opend the box I was amazed (and a little intimidated, I'll admit) at the teeny tiny size! I've gotten used to it though, and now it seems just right to me...although whenever someone new sees it they always comment on how tiny it is. The camera has a lightwight yet good solid feel to it, just right to me. I bought a replacement battery for this (generic, about 12 bucks here on amazon, great deal and as good as the original that came w/ camera) but I was amazed as upon recieving this camera I was able to play with and figure out setting and controls for about 4 hours before the low battery symbol popped up (that was WITH the LCD on at all times!) The spare battery still comes in handy though when I don't want to wait an hour and a half to charge original or when away. Another thing, OMG is the picture quality amazing, I mean you can zoom in and see pores! (okay maybe that's not such a great thing sometimes...) I find though that pictures turn out much better for me when I just put it on auto, rather than manual and adjust it myself. I also bought the red leather case made for this model, which makes it a little more pricy if, like me, you are on a budget but it is a good investment and has protected my camera wonderfuly and compactly. (It snazzes it up a bit too.) Another thing which earns my praises is that it takes amazing action shots, most of them captured in auto. If you like accentric off-beat humorus pics like me...I have captured objects and people in mid-air...funny expressions on peoples faces...the speed of the camera in awesome when you need to whip it out and take a quick pick and capture. (start up time and playback are about as fast as I could amagine a camera being.) Movie mode is great. The color accent and color swap features are so much fun. Downloading on your computer is quick and easy, also fun how you could hook it right up to your tv with one of the cables that came with it and watch your movies and pics...evrything is so easy I browsed the menu when I had a question but most of it is just cake.

Originally, I was going to buy a higher end SLR camera for this trip but decided the bulk and worry behind carrying a camera like that would not be worth it. This being said, let me talk about how happy I am with the quality and color of the SD600.First off, in proper situations, the color and brightness of the SD600 are far superior to all other small digital camera's I tried. When I am getting photos printed, I still have to do some small adjustments in photoshop most of the time, but that's only really nitpicky.The SD600 also has a view finder, which is great for traveling and general shooting because all LCD screens on the back of cameras can get washed out by the sun, making them very hard to see. Although the view finder is not great, it still helps drastically and is a important and fast dieing feature in a camera.One of my only complaints is quality of the flash. But, this isn't a fault unique to the SD600. Because of the physically tiny size of the flash in the SD600, it is hard for it to get as even, wide and distant spread as I would like.My only other complaint (besides the price), is that the LCD screen on the back doesn't seem to show true colors perfectly. Pictures taken with a flash often look a little washed and it's hard to see small blurs in low light pictures.Even with these two complaints, I would still recommend this camera. It is easy to use, takes surprisingly great pictures and movies and is so physically small you could take it anywhere, effortlessly.

My Samsung lasted 2 years and my Kodak only lasted one.  Coincidentally, my Samsung crapped out the same exact day that my Samsung video camera crapped out...EMP?Anyways, I was a little hesitant paying $200+ for a camera especially since my track record, but read some decent reviews on CNET and took the leap.  Wow!  I am impressed.Other than a small feature set (who needs em anyways), this is the perfect camera and I couldnt be happier.  Perfect 1MB pictures with resolution of 2600x1200.  With a 1GB SD card, this will give me unlimited amounts of space.I actually picked this out because of the battery pack.  I read somewhere that you can take 300 pictures on one charge up (no flash) or 160 pictures with flash.  If one thing annoyed me was having to replace batteries all the time on my other cameras.  This comes with a little pack about the size of a checkerboard square and a portable charger.There is also a great video mode on it too.  Although not DVD quality video and the .AVI format takes up a bit more space, I would not trade this for anything.  I can now create nice little home videos without having to go out and buy another camcorder.I am shocked at the audio range the mic picks up, although some ambient sounds are picked up and sounds tinny.  I believe a 1GB card holds up to 58 minutes.  But to be truthful, how many home videos do we have that only have boring fluff for 10s of minutes.  This camera is perfect for the \"have to get\" video.  I figure if I need a longer video then I can purchase a 4GB card.  Anyways, .AVI format will easily allow me to convert it to any other format...thats always nice.Just to add, we recently went on a 9-day week vacation.  We took over 400 pictures and a dozen or show video clips worth 20minutes or so, and had to swap out batteries on the very last day.  We had a secondary battery so that was cool but could have easily charged our original battery every night.Bottom line...if you can get this model, great.  If not, get the SD1000.  The SD1000 actually is 7.1MP instead of 6 and I think it's running about $240 in the stores.  According to my co-worker who I talked into getting one, it comes in two cosmetic flavors; a black face and a chrome face.One word of advice if you decide to get this model or similar; Canon seems to have some type of image stabilization technology on it.  When taking your pictures, be sure to half-click the button before actually snapping the shot.  This seems to allow the picture to still itself.

Not intended to replace a video camera, I was surprised how good the video actually is. A nice feature the 110 lacked is you can zoom the video while shooting. The 3x optical zoom is typical of the genre and a longer reach would be a welcome improvement. Controls fall very nicely under your right thumb and were very easy to master.

The switch on the upper-right of the camera is too close to the edge, and too easy to chance, which leads to what you expect to be photos being taken as movies. There was a similar problem with the dial used on previous models like the S70.It's not the end of the world, but something that Canon could do better than they have on this camera.I still love the thing and would buy the camera again if mine fell in the lake tomorrow.", "Date": "February 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "PowerShot SD 600 from Canon", "Author": "John Frederick", "ReviewID": "RZOGSKU8TVFVY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most satisfied with the purchase.

The SD1000 is the SD600 successor but is boxier with respect to the 600. I like the 600 because it has a sturdy body and is compact. I bought the leather case that goes with the camera and the case fits like a glove on the camera protecting it in case I drop it. The screen is a decent size and this camera is one of the few I liked which still had an optical viewfinder instead of just the LCD showing what I was going to take a picture of.Picture quality is 4/5. I had a Sony 5MP camera before I bought this Canon one and the Sony one just had a crisp clearer picture. Canon has decent image quality nonetheless and accepts SD which is less proprietary than Sony's Memory Stick and less expensive of course. Canon also is known for the different modes in which pictures can be shot, with color especially. It's nifty if you want to play with the functions (because it has so many) and if you're hanging out with your friends and want fun pictures. Indoor shots are decent and the pictures don't tend to be blurry even when taken with an unsteady hand.With a 2GB memory card, you can snap around 1100 pictures in 6MP format. Also the multiple snapshot function works well when you're taking candid pictures of people and at parties. You can always delete the ones you don't like later when you transfer them to the computer via a card reader or USB. Video recording is a bit on the rough side when it comes to recording a show because the image will blur in and out.One of the bad things about the camera/video/play switch is that sometimes you mean to take a picture and you end up recording a movie which is kind of cumbersome because you miss a really great picture moment.It's not the slimmest camera out there like the Sony T7 but it can definitely compete in the other departments like different modes and a more widely accepted memory format. If you're looking for a fashionable camera and it has to be compact as well, I would definitely recommend this camera among the others.Battery life is 5/5.

I also like the fast start up time, the long battery life, and the various functions like video, continuous shooting mode etc...  None of these functions are unique to Cannon cameras though.  The color rendition is excellent.And this camera is pretty durable too.  I've carry one of these around often in my jean pocket.  The view screen did get scratched up a bit, but that's my fault for keeping coins and keys in the same pocket occasionally.What I didn't like about this camera is the quality of the pictures.  Even in good light you don't get really crisp and sharp pictures.  Perhaps I'm not being fair here.  The pictures from my Fuji2700 (only 2 mega pixels) look much crisper and sharper, but that camera is much bulkier with the bigger lens.  To be fair, I have not seen better pictures from any other super compact cameras in this class either.So, over all I would recommend this camera over any other comparable 6Mega pixel models in the same price range.

The other camera had come out later, had most of the same features, but cost quite a bit more.I finally chose the SD600 and I am so glad I did! After 3 months, I cannot find much that isn't there.-- Ease of use:  Although there is a learning curve, the menues are very intuitive.-- Easy switching to \"record video,\" \"take photos,\" and playback. This especially useful on the fly so you can switch quickly.-- Size aand quality of LCD.  Although there are other cameras out there with the same or large size, the quality of the LCD screen is amazing.-- I use this camera as my primary video camera.  Although there are features that are not on the video portion that full-fledged video cams have, it has enough features so that I can do all that I want. The only negative is that you can't optically zoom while taking video, but can with the digital zoom enabled.  When used, the quality deteriates rather dramatically.-- I like the memory cards.  You can have a couple around and never run out of room.  I bought two 2GB from Kingston on Amazon. They work great.-- I have never run the lithium battery down so that I have to recharge in the middle of shooting.  However, I bought a back up just in case.-- Even with no stabilzation features, the video is pretty steady.  Enough so that people watching it don't complain, but no where near professional quality.  I had a tripod (Targus-$30) which is very durable.  The little camera looks funny atop the tripod, but it sure does help steady the shots or provide the ability to use the self-timer.-- The software that comes with the camera is fantastic.  It was so easy and automatic, I didn't have to learn anything.  Seamless tranfer from camera to computer or direct to a portable device, makes the usual burden of transfer a thing of the past. Video and Photos alike are almost a one-button transfer.-- Of all the qualities, the size is the best.  I carry the camera in my front pocket on my jeans and it is comfortable there.  I would recommend getting a screen protector for the LCD (the lens has a self-cover). This allows me to be very mobile and \"instantly\" ready for great photos or video on the fly.In summary, I don't think you can get a 6 megapixel camera with as many features as the SD600 for the money.  I bought mine for $138 as refurbished from a third party through Amazon. I have the original warranty and there isn't anything wrong with it. (It came in the original box with original documents and accessories.)AS MUCH AS I HAVE PRAISED THIS CAMERA, YOU MIGHT THINK I SELL THEM WHICH I DON'T.

Not only did I get a good deal, but it's a very attractive camera with a bigger LCD.I like being able to just point and shoot and never had any problems with getting great pictures from the S400, which is what a compact camera like this is for.  The SD600 makes you really work for a good picture (I thought switching to manual mode would help), and even then, the quality is very dissapointing.I was EXTREMELY dissapointed in this camera and have really tried to like it, especially since I got such a great deal.  Every picture taken with a flash has red eye, even set on red-eye reduction.  Forget taking pictures anywhere but outside in bright light.  Pictures taken indoors, or in any type of natural lighting are either very grainy or blurry.  Forget trying to use the high ISO in low lighting, the pictures are even more unbelievably grainy.  But keeping the ISO lower produces very dark pictures in natural to low lighting.I took my first pictures with this camera at my daughter's communion and was so dissapointed.  The pictures were so unbelievably grainy, and if they weren't grainy, they were either blurry or there was not enough flash to capture a good picture.  And this was in a church where half the church is windows and there was a lot of natural lighting.  They were so bad, they actually looked like they were taken with my daughter's kid digital camera I bought her for $20.I decided to try to take some more pictures to give the camera the benefit of the doubt, but have produced more bad pictures than good ones to warrant keeping this camera.  I don't know what happened to Canon's quality when it comes to pictures, but now I'm bummed because I will have to find a new favorite.I am sure I could get into all the manual controls a little more and maybe get some better quality pictures, but that would defeat the purpose of having a small point and shoot type of camera.  If I wanted to mess with manual controls to get a good picture, I'd get an SLR.I don't understand all the great reviews this camera has gotten.  Do I just have a lemon or are others not as picky about the quality of their photos?  I researched this camera and bought it because of the great reviews, but after going through the reviews here with ratings 3 stars and lower, I do see that I am not the only one experiencing bad quality photos.

I have the newest Digital Rebel SLR, a Canon printer, and a Canon scanner. I have had Canon film cameras in the past too. I recently sold my Canon G5 since I now have the SLR and I wanted to buy a pocket camera. So, I bought this SD600.  Now I know why the price keeps dropping. It simply doesn't take a good picture. It has trouble focusing on almost every shot in almost every condition, and I don't want to start messing with manual setting on a pocket camera.  I want point and shoot - or I'll use my SLR.  I would have thought I had a lemon, but the video came out terrific which tells me the camera was able to focus just fine.Kudos to Adorama Camera Inc. They took the camera back and fully refunded me even though I was past the due date in contacting them.  I would buy from them again - but I don't think I'll buy an Elph. Although, my brothers three year old Elph still works and picts look great.In summary, I believe this camera to be a lemon and that is why the price keeps falling.

Whenever I got home I took my Sandisk card out of the camera and put it directly into my computer's SD expansion slot. For some reason the card would not work. Well I didn't know what was wrong so I tried it in my camera and the camera said \"MEMORY CARD ERROR\". I then tried to connect the camera with the usb that came with the camera and the same error message still appeared. I have tried several things to fix the problem and nothing seems to work. Last resort I Googled the problem I was having on the internet and a ton of feedback appeared on photo forum websites. This seems to have been a problem for awhile now with not only this camera but  ALOT OF Canon cameras.
