There's no need for the camera to reset, just point at your subject and keep on clicking.  It will take continuous pictures.  The 8gb SD card was missing, but I emailed the company it came from, they apologized profusely and said they would send one right out.  That was a few day ago and I haven't received it yet, but I'm sure it will arrive soon.  If it doesn't, I will update my post.  All in all, I am very happy this purchase and may purchase one for my daughter's upcoming Birthday.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome camera for the money", "Author": "Mark Lusk", "ReviewID": "R3P9MT2UTYM1PH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for the wife and she loves it.
