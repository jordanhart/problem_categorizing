{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worked great for 9 months...", "Author": "SL \"pismo10\"", "ReviewID": "R8SP13XKALUJ4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This unit is very nice until it went out of focus after about 9 months of use. It has a fixed focus lens so I am stuck. Nice piece, good image, easy to use, difficult to setup but very stable once it began to work. The only problem is it is now unusable due to the focus problem. It has become nearsighted. I am glad I only paid $99 for it. If I had paid $500+ like many of the Panasonic cams I would be very upset. Can't recommend it.", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$214.33", "Features": "Panasonic Consumer", "Name": "Panasonic KX-HCM110A PetCam Network Camera with 2-Way Audio", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31jhneWlt7L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00130BSVG"}}
