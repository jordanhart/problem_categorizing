There are 2 extra batteries, which is most helpful when on the go I highly recommend the 32mb card, whether taking pics or videos. Although the bag is too small for the camera and additional battery, but can be force to fit. However, it would be better to buy an additional carry-on bag for the rest of the equipment. Other than that, it's a best buy.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$301.04", "Features": "A backlit 16 megapixel sensor coupled with the new-generation imaging engine delivers a top sensitivity of ISO 6400\nFurther enhanced waterproof construction allows for depth of 45 feet\nTriple shake reduction with sensor shift shake reduction, shockproof for drops up to 6.5-Feet, cold resistant to 14 degrees F, dustproof\n3-Inch LCD, HD 1080P video with h.264 compression @ 30fps\nGPS module for Geo tracking, built in compass, pressure/altitude/water depth gauges and wireless recharging capabilities", "Name": "Pentax Optio WG-3 16MP Waterproof Digital Camera with GPS (Purple) + 32GB SDHC Class 10 Memory Card + Extra LI-50B Battery + External Rapid Charger + Carrying Case + Mini Tripod Kit + USB SDHC Reader + Memory Wallet", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51a7EdAXO4L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00C6OY3NI"}}
