This product, however, requires the buyer to have a moderate knowledge base in networking, IP protocols, HTTP, Windows Security in regards to ActiveX, and at the very least, the ability to research online. The only problem I have had is getting an ipad2 to work with the unit.

If you restart the dvr it will start working again.This is bad. Leaves my shop and residence vulnerable until I can get a replacement.Amazon is giving a full refund. I will not recommend anyone buy this.I had a lower end Q-See qs206 DVR before this and thought I was upgrading. The Q-See is still running.Please beware. If you depend on this for security it has proven to be very unreliable.Mine boots up then goes off.Was working ok for a month ONLY. Too much money for this to FAIL!!!!!!!! Very unhappy..SOFTWARE says \"CONNECT FAILED CANN\"T FIND DEVICE\"  and yes it says it with 2 n's in can't :-/I purchased the unit on the 8th. package was sealed.DVR was scratched and had some type residue on the case.Rubber feet were dirty even though this was in a sealed box.Attempted to install the hard drive and the holes on the bracket did not line up.Bracket for the cd drive also does not line up.After getting the drives installed I turn the unit on and it boots up without issue.The software is very good and easy to use and navigate. (Full featured)Remote control does not work!I'm returning this unit and will try another of the same brand.Hopefully this was just a bad unit.Manual is of a different item. PTZ does not work.There is NO tech support. Please be aware when buying this unit.I had Geovision and Q see both worked well.I was trying to upgrade from a Q See unit so I would have the D1 quality. very bad idea.Many phone calls and emails and no response.I will not buy another DNT product. BUYER BEWARE", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beware of DNT TECH", "Author": "oliver d. maruna", "ReviewID": "RG61354OLVNFH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After finding DNT tech on the internet and Amazon, I contacted the company directly since they were in the Los Angeles area.  I spoke to the salesperson Derrick Tam, who sold me the DVR and 3 cameras.  They offered to install the items, the installation fee alone of which came out to $485.  Within a couple months of purchasing their products and having them installed at my home, I began to have problems with either the DVR or one of the cameras, I wasn't sure because it would either intermittently work and not work.  I am extremely busy running my own business, and not until we had a break-in 10 months later did I finally do something about it.  I called Derrick to ask about having someone come out to check it out.  Instead of sending someone out, Derrick told me I should bring the cameras in and the DVR so they could have a look at it.  This sounded reasonable, but after a few hours fiddling around on my roof and attic I realized that this was a dumb idea, because the problem could be in the wiring and somebody would need to come to my place to property assess what the issue is, especially since I had paid their company for both the products and the installion.  When I called again about getting someone to come out, Derrick got very defensive, not even remembering who I was.  I had the impression that many people must call regarding problems because he didn't even listen to me.  He didn't offer a warranty on the installation or even mention that he could have someone come out to look at it for a charge, he just hung up on me after a minute of telling me that the sale was a one time thing.  A \"one time thing!\"  Be careful when dealing with this company because I'm sure you will get the same excuse when your products begin to fail after a time, I believe they are substandard and company's way of doing business is not what we would expect from a reputable company.  Better to go with a recognized brand and company than DNT tech.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buyer Please Beware", "Author": "Angelia Fleming", "ReviewID": "RBEO54Q9XX0DV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the unit in May of 2012.  In October of 2013 the unit started making a loud sound that to this day has never stopped. I contacted the company and spoke with an associate.  He asked when the unit was purchased and I told him May of 2012. This individual told me that from what I had described he thought it was the fan. That the unit could be fixed if i paid to have UPS to have it shipped and pay for the repair, which shoud be aroung $80.00  I know the unit is not under warrant.  I want it repaired and was willing to pay for it.  He asked for my e-mail address so he could send me a repair ticket. Again, I am not stupid, I know I have to pay for this.  I am willing to do so!  Well, shortly there after I get an e-mail, which did not have a repair ticket but it had a link where I could purchase another of their unit.  I called them back, is there some confusion.  I was then told that they could not repair my unit.  So, I am now left to find someone, somewhere ro repair my unit.
