After looking at reviews and trying out others, including ones that photographers swore was the only camera for them, I decided to buy a Nikon.  I get the $250 Nikon home, and the quality isn't there.I return it, and go back to Pentax.  This camera is amazing.  It's so small I forget it's in my pocket. It takes incredible pictures.  I took it to France for 10 days and now have friends, coworkers, family members all asking where I got \"that painting\" (they're always photos that I took).One bad note - the battery contacts broke and I had to send the camera in for repairs.  It was within warranty and fixed promptly. The situation was handled well, I just wish it wouldn't have been an issue to begin with.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pentax Optio 15921 Digital Camera", "Author": "Andrea Kubinski", "ReviewID": "R1D1NJB174CVUZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this camera.  It has a lot of settings, it is small and sleek.  The snap of the photo isn't bad.  I still need to read the owners manual to learn more about all the features.  The only thing I notice is that the flash is so bright that it almost whites out what you are taking the picture of.  I have played with some of the basic settings and taking a photo in \"green mode\" does seem to help a bit.  Like I said, I do need to read the owners manual and I can perhaps turn down the brightness of it (just haven't figured it out) - even on a soft flash it does it.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "pentax optio 15921 digital camera", "Author": "2seta", "ReviewID": "R21LHL6G88AUBU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great little camera.

Even has a self timer", "Author": "Paula fitz", "ReviewID": "R2E8Y1QPA8HWQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Pentax Optio S1 after reading many reviews on different cameras here. Originally, I purchased a Panasonic Lumix and was disappointed with it so returned it and got this one in an aqua color. I love it! Many years ago I had a similar camera made by Pentax under a generic name (Norcent) and the Pentax Optio S1 had all the features the Norcent had, so I was very familiar with how to work it from day one.There are a lot of settings and a lot of choices for scene selection to help you capture photos perfectly in different situations- even a pet setting that has features for white animals and black animals (either of which can be hard to get good quality pics of without over/under exposure).  The \"kid\" and \"sports\" settings are great for anything fast moving to avoid blurs. Sunset works well for lower light, as does the Nighttime setting. Too many to list here, but well worth a bit of your time playing with them to find out what works best in your situation. The self timer has a 2 and 10 second timer you can choose from- its great for setting up a family photo with several folks, and then jumping in at the last few seconds to include yourself.There are many options for brightness, pixels, AE metering, sensitivity, EV compensation, d range, shake reduction, instant review, sharpness, saturation, contrast and even date imprint. Set up in several languages is simple, and explained in the included manual. You can even change the sounds the camera makes and control an automatic shut off timer to preserve battery life.You can even work it in a manual setting if you so desire.Playback of pictures is by one push of a button. Many flash options, or no flash at all. Macro, super macro, pan focus, infinity and manual focus options.The video will record for a long while- I have several 4 and 6 minute videos recorded- it helps to have at least a 4gb card, of which I recommend the Kingston brand here on amazon. Also available are generic rechargeable batteries on AMazon, at a fraction of the cost of the name brand ones- work the same, been buying them for years!This camera comes with the hand strap, a USB cord, battery charger, manual and more.  The battery charger is the type which plugs into the camera itself, and then into the outlet...not a separate charger station like you may be used to.  It charges up rather fast- just under 3 hrs... so it is useful to have a spare, charged battery or two available (and for that matter, a few SD cards too) .A nice feature is the ability to hook the cam to the TV to view as a slide show all the pics on a grand scale!The pictures are not grainy, very crisp. Play with the settings and try taking close ups of flowers in super macro mode-- magnificent.  You'll love the camera... it is worth paying for verses the higher rated cameras...it holds its own. Pentax did well with this one!!!!", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, nice features and beautiful pictures", "Author": "Bob101", "ReviewID": "R2RIYVNS2TSJ42", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as I have had good results with other cmaeras made by this manufacturer.
