{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The best 10MP camera for the money", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Author of Gypsy Dreamer\"", "ReviewID": "R1SJE8TXL6G4HW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I previously bought a 10MP Fuji camera. I returned it because it was not a good camera. It was tough choosing another camera that was not too expensive. After a lot of time I chose this one and I am glad I did.I like a digital camera that takes good shots of people. I like a camera that brings out good flesh tones in people. This camera does it. Most all the pictures are sharp with great color. NO camera will make perfect shots on every shot. This one has a high success rate especially in auto mode. I have some great shots of El Salvador!I have a 10MP DSLR that is great. For taking regular snapshots of life, this little baby is great. It is clean, clear and small. It did take a while to learn the buttons and menus but take your time, you will learn.Here are the PROS and CONSPROS1. Small2. Seems durable3. Great snapshots4. Great for taking shots of people5. Good for landscapes6. I like the dial on top, it reminds me of SLR cameras.7. Many modes and easy to change between all.8. You can change ISO from 100 to 16009. I held this camera out the window of a taxi in San Salvador, El Salvador and took 10 random pictures WITHOUT image stabilization turned on. All photos came out SHARP.10. It has a great, rechargeble L-ION battery that you can re-charge via USB or AC.CONS1. A little slow between shots. Could be my non fast SD card (older model).2. Video is not great. It is a little shaky. I played with the controls and made it better.3. It has a strange spring loaded cover on the side for charging, AV etc. I dont know if it will last for long.4. The image stabilization doesn't help much. It already is very stable.If money is no object, buy a Canon for double the price. If not, buy this.It is a great camera. I am very happy with it.", "Date": "September 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RPGNHBXVYDVII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a 10.2 MP Camera, the picture quality is great, high res and good imaging.

Excellent buy for $129 for a great high res camera / video.", "Date": "July 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Style Slimmed to Perfection", "Author": "ZeeMan", "ReviewID": "R14U8X27DRZZ84", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this camera today so it won't reflect too much on technical aspects/features. First of all I want to say that the picture featured here and Best Buy for L200 isn't correct. If you want to see the accurate picture then find L210 model and L200 looks exactly like that model. Only difference between the two model is L200 has Digital Image Stabilizer and L210 has Dual Stabilizer (both optical and digital).I was really surprised at how small this camera is. I know lot of people actually coomplains of the compactness of some digital cameras, now I see their reason for complaint. Because it really does feel like it might slip and fall. But I like compact/thin cameras so it was big plus for me.It comes with an AC adapter so you are not stuck with USB cable to recharge the camera through your computer. Also included in the package is A/V cable to view pictures or video directly through TV monitor.Manual that comes with the package isn't much help since it's just a quick reference with 10 other languages. So you need to download the manual through the CD-ROM and it is 102 page worth of info that needs to be digested before actually appreciating all the features this little camera comes with. I took about 30 picture today and all of them look superb and I was twicking with different settings and modes.Best reason to get this camera is the price.Update: I have been using this camera for 15 days and I love all the quick scene modes and program mode. Auto mode does everything really well, too. One complaint I've is that it doesn't let you delete a shot during preview. For example, after you've taken a shot you can view it from 1-3 sec but you won't be able to delete the shot then rather have to go to picture view to delete. But I'm very satisfied with the quality pictures.Update 12/05/2008: Still satisfied and still 5-stars. I do have one suggestion though: I found that leaving the setting on AUTO mode or Scene Mode is the best option. Also, if one turns off the flash then there's no guarantee if the picture would look blurry or not. Unless one have surgeon precision hands or a tripod, then don't risk setting the flash off. There's DIS (digital image stabilizer) which is for low lighting condition without flash and the image isn't blurry but that takes few seconds to actually take the shot, so not a good option on the fly. But with auto flash on the pictures are of amazing quality.", "Date": "August 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera with many features!", "Author": "T. Turley", "ReviewID": "R1H0ZE0DMYPYBD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is easy to use with all the special features of a much more expensive camera.  It takes videos with sound that you can instantly play back.  With a 4GB memory card you can take up to 800 super fine 10mp pictures.  It is very slim and easily fits in a pocket.  The software program was simple to install on my computer; I then plugged in the camera and uploaded the pictures.  It took wonderful close ups of my kids.  I love the pictures you can take in a series.  It took super scenic pictures on our hike and great pictures of fireworks.", "Date": "July 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Love this Camera", "Author": "Dawna Van Buren \"busyredhed\"", "ReviewID": "R2C4OVRV21CX0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked two of these up at the local Circuit City after returning the Canon A580 to Amazon that I wasn't happy with. This is a great camera for the price. It's sturdy, easy to use, great pictures, easy menus, small enough for your pocket. For the price, I don't think you could get a better camera. I bought two of these along with 2gb memory cards each and still spent under $300.00. Both of my boys are going Overseas in the Military and they will both get a great camera to take with them.", "Date": "June 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Problem I encountered", "Author": "M. Boksa", "ReviewID": "R1YHT149F95738", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera a week ago and the first day i got it, it worked pretty well and then once I had a handful of pictures on the camera I noticed the camera would freeze up when browsing and you would have to remove the battery to start the camera again. Then I tried a couple more times and if it didnt freeze the same pictures would say \"File Error\" and this actually happened with 20% of the pictures I had so i would be very cautious and think twice before going through with this purchase. The features and everything else was awesome but I just couldnt have a camera that would have errors on photos i had taken and force me to delete them as well as have the camera freeze up. So think twice before buying if you want to take the risk of getting the same problems as I did", "Date": "November 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Right Price...But out of foucs", "Author": "C. Barreto", "ReviewID": "RXBNLSCECEKMD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed an upgrade after lugging around a bulkly Sony 3.2 Megapixel camera to Vegas.  It was obvious that my camera was outdated and wanted to find a camera with more punch that fit in my pocket...Insert the Samsung L200.  For the price, value and features it was an easy decision.  I  had an event in a low-lit venue and after some practice shots, I was able to take some nice, clear photos.  But, the biggest issue I keep running into is that if there is even the slightest motion, the shot would be out of focus.  I tired the Stability feature, and it was slow and didn't make much of a difference.  My old Sony was able to take pictures from a moving car, this one, I haven't been able to (not when I'm driving of course!).

My thinking was that if cameras are so fragile, better get a cheap one, and so I purchased this. This was a mistake, since I sacrificed tremendously on my photographs -- arguably the bottom line with cameras.I've had this camera for about a year now and while I'm pleased with the battery life , construction, and other features, I am very disappointed with the actual photography experience. When you turn the camera on, it takes 5-6 seconds from when you first click the button to when the photo actually takes. That's enough time to completely lose the spontaneity of the shot, or the shot entirely. Moreover, if you leave the flash option on \"auto\", it almost always uses the red-eye reduction flash, even when there is sufficient light and when other (better) cameras would not use the flash. In those situations, if you turn off the \"auto\" option and force it to not use the flash, then the photo comes out blurry, and the anti-shake \"technology\" seems to be no help whatsoever. There is no way to change the exposure time as far as I can tell to compensate. The result: bad photos and lost photo opportunities (while you fiddle with the settings).I don't know why I've waited so long to get a replacement but enough is enough.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Camara did not last one week", "Author": "Jose Esquivel V", "ReviewID": "R10WLFD0C5L836", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After a week of use the camara started to get stuck and I was not even able to turn it off. and seems that now I have to contact Samsung for them to fix it instead of getting a return of refund from the seller. bummer....", "Date": "February 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Only one small problem...", "Author": "I.
