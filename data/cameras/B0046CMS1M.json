Upgraded from Rebel XSI to do movies.  I did a commercial and the guy shooting it used this camera and showed me previous edited results...completely pro and WOW.J & R dealer is a great dealer, even if they are from New York.  I've done business with them for a few years now...matter of fact I bought my Rebel from them...and they've been great.  Great dealer + great product...how can you go wrong.  The accessories are a bit cheesy but I was buying the camera not the accessories.  BTW if you're going to shoot movies upgrade to a 32 level 10 card and get extra batteries...go to BATT DEPOT for all your batteries, they are the best including handling returns for dumb shts like me who order the wrong stuff...that's BATT DEPOT....NOTTTTTT...BATTERY DEPOT...two different outfits.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm hooked", "Author": "annabellinni", "ReviewID": "R2AGQSZW6D55ST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the camera that is starting my photography addiction.
