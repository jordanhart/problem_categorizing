{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Horrible mounts", "Author": "w earp", "ReviewID": "R2PER8OZWY30S5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Cameras are great and night vision is outstanding.  The mounts are horrible.  They will not lock or support the weight of these cameras. EDIT to add: Well, there is no way to get proper mounts through Amazon or CIB without buying them separately.  I have to send these cameras back, because I don't have time to waste on finding or making new mounts.  I bought the smaller cameras with better mounts.  Return shipping was free through Amazon.  Get some good mounts and this is a great camera, range is amazing.", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good camera bad bracket.", "Author": "S. Young", "ReviewID": "R7ZHGD2M7CHIK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a large camera with a lot of weight. Bracket won't hold camera and broke trying to install. So far camera looks to have good night vision.Update 10/22/2013:OK, so these cameras are no longer available in single units. I ordered the 4 camera package and received 4 8795s, a far inferior product. Beware, this is the third time USA Security Store has pulled a \"Bait-n-Switch\" on me. Only purchase CUC cameras through Amazon for easy return. USA Security took almost 3 months to get me a return label. Dumb me, I already ordered and paid for better brackets that I can't now use.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "good for long range", "Author": "charles cantral", "ReviewID": "R1NJO3STHWFNCR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "that are sofar a good cam..for a sold mount. but you need to buy a good mount that doesnt bend for thes cams", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$229.00", "Features": "1/3 CCD Vandal Indoor Outdoor 480TVL High Resolution Color Camera Day / Night Vision, with Sony Super HAD CCD Image Sensor\nWall mount and Celling mount\nUltra Power infra-red LEDs see in the dark up to 160ft\nThis product is CIB Security Exclusive with CIB brand name\nOne Year Warranty Guaranteed", "Name": "CIB CUC8757-4 Four 480TVL Outdoor Long Range CCD Bullet IR Security Camera So...", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418hCdiwACL.jpg", "ProductID": "B004LI94FY"}}
