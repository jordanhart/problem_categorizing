{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome camera with the best wifi and Android apps available on any camera.", "Author": "Richard Evans", "ReviewID": "R21LB8S693CG9O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a really nice camera that takes very sharp photos using a 16.3 backside-illuminated CMOS sensor. What that means is that it can take photos in very low light without a flash. I took a picture in low light and the camera in Smart Auto mode choose an ISO of 1280. There wasn't any discernible noise even when viewed on my 22\" Samsung monitor.The 21x zoom offers an extremely wide range of viewing angles. From 23mm wide to 483mm telephoto.One of the features that makes a touchscreen very desirable is the ability to use your finger to choose the area where you want the camera to focus. Other cameras (even my DSLR) require you to focus on your subject using a half press of the shutter and then move the camera to compose the shot while still holding down the shutter. With the touchscreen you just compose the shot and then select the area you want in focus and then press the shutter.The Wifi works really well. I can easily share my photos with anyone who has an NFC equipped phone, email recipients or a host of other social networking sites. The Auto backup works very well but you must first install the Auto backup software onto you computer.The Samsung Smart camera app works very well and has the highest rating of any such app. The Sony, Panasonic, Canon and Nikon apps aren't nearly as robust or as compatible and have lower ratings. Of course this camera does have a small sensor so don't expect the same picture quality you will get with a much larger camera. But that's the thing. I wanted a pocket sized camera with a long zoom, that would be easy to upload my photos to my Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 tablet. Cameras with larger sensors have much larger lenses and won't fit in your pocket.This camera does what it's supposed to. Clear bright photos that are easy to compose and control with the hybrid touchscreen interface. Unlike cameras that only offer touchscreen, this hybrid camera lets you use either the touchscreen or tactile buttons.Currently this camera is only available at Costco where they bundle it with a Case Logic Case and a 16gb micro SD card. It uses the Samsung SLB-10A battery which is widely available. It charges in the camera but for less than $10 you can buy an external charger and a spare battery.The camera body has a nice leather-like covering that is easy to grip and there is a thumb rest on the back. There is a one button video recording feature and you can even take stills while shooting video. I've shopped around and no other small, pocket sized camera offers the same features and ease of sharing that this camera offers at anything close to this price. Sure the Samsung NX300 offers better photo quality but it's hardly pocketable and even with two lenses you won't have the same range. Plus it's price sets it in the DSLR range.The WB350F is small and unobtrusive so you won't be a target for camera thieves. I hesitate to take my DSLR to places where there is a lot of dust or sand but a low cost, sealed lens camera is much less of a gamble.Look at the user reviews of Samsung cameras such as the WB800F which is very similar to this camera. 4 and a half stars overall. The WB250F also scores very well.Ignore the other review you see here on Amazon. This camera takes way better pictures than any phone or tablet. This camera has a glass multi-element lens that blows away a plastic phone lens with no optical zoom. Also the in camera effects filters are fun and easy to use. When this camera hits the stores it will be very popular for it's features, performance, wifi sharing and it's cool retro look. Highly recommended.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "meh, returned it", "Author": "Con Sumer", "ReviewID": "R2G0QXZG6UV9WI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wanted to try samsung for a camera and bought this cam at a local retail store. My first compact superzoom and first samsung camera. Very disappointed. It takes pictures like any other 50-100-dollar camera. No need to spend this much on this overpriced gimmickry if you only need zoom and don't care about image quality. Older WB models are cheaper and offer the same image quality and same crippled wifi+app functions. Without the zoom my phone and tablet 5MP cameras are similar quality. If you want fast startup/operation and functional wifi this cam and possibly older WB models are not for you. Annoying screens between switching modes explaining what each mode does  will make you miss shots. No way to disable these screens. Not possible to turn off useless digital zoom in Auto mode. Its easy to overzoom into digital if you don't look at the screen. I like the touchscreen but it feels laggy like old displays. The camera itself feels slow. Horizonal viewing angle is good but vertical is useless when you try to raise the camera slightly over a window frame or a fense and shoot top to bottom. At eye level trying to peak at the lcd i couldn't see anything. Other cameras i own have perfect vertical and horizontal viewing angles in non-flip displays. It has a pop-up tiltable flash on the left side which i liked.I can't remember how many useless filters and special effects this camera has. In camera editing, really??? Good luck using that slow low quality touch display. Who wants to do that in camera. It has everything but good image quality. The lens is not sharp. 1x to about 13x zoom objects appear closer. After not much difference between 13x and 21x zoom. Not sure if all compact superzooms are like that or just this cam. Maybe i should save some $ with an older 12x or 18x zoom. At 21x distant objects like birds appeared washed out, shot in Auto with tripod OIS on. F2.8 lens won't save you in low light situations. This camera over and underexposes in almost any situation. Sometimes it got auto WB wrong indoors with CFL light. Forget action shot in any situation with this camera.Video - noisy motor while zooming and optical stabilizer can be heard in video. Cam has an option to turn \"sound alive\", whatever that means, off. The manual says it disables sound recording during video. It doesn't. Quality is about the same as my 5MP phone and tablet 1080/30p video. Nothing amazing. Focusing during stills and video seemed ok to my eye. Cam didn't focus hunt much. For macro shots cam seemed to be able to focus closer than the advertised 10cm. For manual focusing i couldn't tell looking at this low-average resolution LCD if the cam focused properly. I use manual focusing with interchangeable lenses, not compacts. I think its useless with low resolution display compacts.WiFi - one of the reasons why i wanted to try this cam and its very limited and crippled. I'm only interested in remote viewfinder. Don't care for uploading to cloud or social media crap. Downloaded android 3-in-1 app. Sharing/saving in phone/tablet, baby monitor, remote viewfinder. I don't care for sharing. Baby monitor was slow to refresh over my wifi and the sound this camera makes (music+baby crying) is extremely annoying. Cam mono mic works in a strange way so you can only see video, not audio, but when 'baby' makes sound the mic picks it up and sends a signal to the remote device to activate the annoying music+cry sound. No recording/adjustments in baby monitor mode. Really stupid. Try taking several pictures, selecting them one at a time and transferring to your device. Try selecting 10-100-1000+ photos one at time. Really, samsung? Who writes this software. Most important wifi viewfinder is very limited. It doesn't allow 16MP, only 12 or 2MP, zoom, saving to camera or cam+mobile device. No video rec, no adjustments. I don't even know what settings camera uses in remote viewfinder mode because i could shoot ok in Auto in low light but when switched to wifi under the same conditions the screen and images were unusable. I couldn't pre-set the camera in PASM modes and then use WiFi. No exposure adjustment in wifi mode. Images didn't look sharp enough to me. Increased sharpness in manual to +2. Made no difference between 0 and +2.Camera froze several times while in play mode. I had to take out the battery to reset. Its bulky and not the most comfortable to hold. Mostly cheap plastic, plastic tripod mount. Only the thumb rest next to video rec button is not slippery. 800 and 250 models felt better in my hand. I don't recommend this camera for anybody. No wonder it doesn't get much attention.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Samsung Smart Camera\nWB350F\nSamsung Compact Camera\nWi-Fi\nNFC", "Name": "Samsung Smart Camera WB350F White Leatherette-coated Wi-fi NFC Support Compact Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JYfzaYyyL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HUUGOXK"}}
