If I had beat the crap out of the camera before the day was done then I would have nobody to blame but myself.  If the camera had simply not functioned due to a day of punishment on the rocks then I would have nobody to blame but myself.However, after taking nearly 30+ pictures throughout the course of the day documenting the ascent I came home to find that only one (1!) was still extant.  The last picture.  The LAST picture!  Argh.  It *appears* the camera reset itself back to its factory defaults just before the last picture of the day, formatting the hard drive in the process.  Dunno.I wasn't expecting brilliance.  I wasn't expecting a lot of features.  I wasn't expecting amazing pictures.  I just expected the camera to retain the pictures it took.Too much to ask, I guess.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive, lightweight-- think of it as a disposable digital camera", "Author": "Lori Culwell \"Author\"", "ReviewID": "R7HEDLP5UIX2T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I gave these away as part of a wedding party, and they were great.  Actually, they were exactly like the old film-based disposable cameras you used to be able to get a few years ago, only digital.  Do you have huge expectations of the quality and long-term nature of the camera?  No, but at this price, it's a great camera for kids, for special occasion purposes like weddings, or for a vacation where you don't want to overload your phone with photos, but you don't necessarily want to lug your super-fancy camera to risk losing it or having it stolen, plus it's light-weight, so it doesn't hog up your suitcase space.  I also found the photos on this little camera to be extremely easy to download.

The internal memory, when the camera was placed on the poorest possible settings, allowed a maximum of about 105 photos that each looked like the underside of a muddy rock. In fact, they were taken at a beach on a reasonably sunny day. When the camera was placed on the highest quality settings, it allowed a maximum of about 26 photos. Stop for a moment and imagine the least attractive shade of dull gray you can. Ready? Okay, now you know what those photos looked like.5-Takes only very brief (less than one minute total) video clips of astonishingly poor quality even when used in excellent lighting.6-All photos/videos are erased if you completely run down or simply remove the batteries.7-All photos/videos sometimes magically disappear even if you don't run down or remove the batteries.8-The viewing window you look through when framing your photos is microscopic and as blurry as one's vision after a three-day bender.My $10 cell phone takes better photos than this thing. Please don't claim that the low price of this camera is an excuse for its abysmal quality.

With an old fashioned view finder and if I lost or damaged it, I would not get upset. This Vivitar camera appeared to be what I wanted. Received it today and wasn't disappointed with the appearance and quality of this inexpensive camera. I took a single photo indoors. It has no flash. Installed the 'Vivitar Experience Image Manager' software and downloaded my picture. I wasn't disappointed. Remember, I wanted a simple snapshot camera and that's what I got! The picture was a bit 'out of focus' and since the photo I took was in a dark part of the room, the resulting photo was not bright but it was 'viewable'. The camera's shutter is very positive and I felt confident that it had snapped the picture. You cannot see the picture until it has been downloaded using the included software. This is nice, simple photo editing software but it is a bit slow responding. Once one gets used to it, it is ideal for downloading the Vivitar pictures. I'm pleased with my $12 camera.
