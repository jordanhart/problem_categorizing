{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great DVR for the price", "Author": "Knight", "ReviewID": "R3RDZ449NYAWK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We're going on 5 months now with this running 24/7.  So far its worked fine with a few complaints.  I would give it 4 stars but the price was the biggest selling point.  Our previous DVR (GE brand) cost $1500.  This one cost $200 and has more HDD space and features. Plus it takes up much less space in the cabinet.  When our security camera repair tech said our previous DVR was toast he said NOT to get a Q-See because he gets a lot of customers who buy them at Costco and they break within the first month. So when I bought this I wasn't counting on much but it has been good so far.Things I liked:1. Price - by far the best value2. Tech support.  I had to call twice and they answered the phone within a minute or two.3. Features - it uses our network so we can view our cameras from our smart phones or internet browser4. Signal strength.  We have two monitors using the BNC output about 500' away from the DVR.  With our previous DVR the images where grainy and had waves.  This one is much clearer using the same cablesThings I don't like:1.  When its recording it puts this big red \"R\" on each camera's display.  I would rather it only tell me if its NOT recording for some reason.2.  Every time the power flickers it resets the displays to all 18 cameras.  We only use 9 cameras so we have to climb up where the DVR is and set it back to 9.  Soon we'll put it on a battery backup so that shouldn't happen anymore.3. It doesn't show the time on the displays - our previous DVR would show that in the bottom corner.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "piece of crap", "Author": "Jay petro", "ReviewID": "R3GLTN0ZNTVZZY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I work with three different manufactures of DVR systems. I HATE this thing, the DVR randomly stops recording even tho it's set to overwrite the old data. You can't remote in half the time, I've tried on several computers. The APP crashes on my G-S3 and on another mytouch 4g. The fan gets noisy. The program that comes with it has issues crashing.This DVR is about a year old.DO NOT buy this!!", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice system", "Author": "R.", "ReviewID": "R2KS85M60ULMQO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "weve had other q-see systems and wanted to continue since they perform so well. this system runs quietly, has alot of input options, looks good, and we run ours 24/7!we found this is much cheaper and more reliable than buying a dvr without a hard drive and purchasing a seperate hard drive.we did this and purchased a 500gb sata hard drive at best buy for $150! and its started making weird sounds so we had to return everything including the dvr and buy this.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Q-See DVR", "Author": "Donjamer", "ReviewID": "RUFALUPA4FX6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Q-See DVR is a great value and works great for what I need..The menus are tough to get used to but otherwise it is great", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "VGA Port to Connect to VGA Monitor\nPre-installed 500GB Hard Drive\nWatch live video or playback video over the Internet from anywhere in the world.\nReceive email alerts when motion is detected\nMobile Phone Surveillance (iPhone, iPad, Win Mobile Pro, Symbian, Blackberry, and other supported Smartphones.)", "Name": "Q-See QS206-5 16-Channel H.264 DVR with Pre-Installed 500 GB Hard Drive", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31j0NHQ5hjL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004SH5UKQ"}}
