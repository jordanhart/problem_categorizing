{"Reviews": [{"Title": "BIG value for the price", "Author": "Calvin (SF)", "ReviewID": "R24OS5NZVRSEM3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for one hundred and seventy seven dollars here at Amazon.  It packs alot of power for a small camera at a very low price.  Here's what I like about it:* Small compact size.  I wouldn't exactly say this camera is meant for you pockets (although it would fit) as it's thicker than the slim design cameras that you may have seen.  However, the thicker frame is what I like about it.  It's very comfortable to hold with two hands - very good ergonomic design...fingers to not get in the way of the flash, lens, or viewfinder.  I've tried taking pictures with the Canon Elph, and the thinness of that camera is very awkward (not good if you grew up with traditional point and shoot cameras).* Excellent, excellent battery life. Say goodbye to proprietary batteries.  This puppy uses two AA batteries.  If you invest $20 for rechargeable Energizer Ni-Mh batteries (4 batteries and a charger), you'll find yourself taking picutres non-stop.  My prior digital camera was a Sony P-50 that also used two AAs.  That camera killed off my Ni-Mh batteries after only about 20-40 pictures depending upon flash usage and how long I left it on.  The S-40 didn't drain my battery until I took about 200 pictures (the vast majority with the flash on - and I didn't try to conserve the battery).  I think it can take a even greater amount, because the 200 was when I 1st got the camera and started playing with all the features wasting battery life.* Relatively fast shutter.  Press half-way to focus, then press all the way - practically no lag to take the picture unlike the older digital cameras.* When using a Memory Stick Pro, the S-40 can take video with sound at 640 x 480 fine quality - good enough to burn onto a DVD and watch on your TV.* Intuitive menu buttons on the camera...also has limited programmable camera features (i.e. ISO settings, EV, white balance, flash strength, center vs multi focus, etc.).* 32 MB of internal memory - probably won't ever need with my 512MB memory stick, but nice to have just in case.* 3X optical zoom on a Carl Zeiss quality lens.* The 35mm equivalent is 32 to 96 millimeters.  What this translates to is that the camera has a wider angle (so you can capture more in the frame without backing up) than a typical 35mm camera lens.  Check out the 35mm equivalent on the other \"micro\" digital cameras and you will find that they are something like 38mm to 102mm, which means you have to backup to capture the same amount of detail.  The higher mm rating is good for zooming, but worse for group photos.  It's alot easier to move forward to your subject (for a manual zoom) than to move backwards (for a manual wider angle) in crowded areas.* Takes good pictures...much better than my old Sony P-50 (which I got in 2001).If I had to list one complaint about the camera, it's that in low lighting any picture taken with the subject greater than about 10 feet away (which is about the flash strength area) will show up \"dingy\" and the background will be in dark faded colors.  HOWEVER, I surmise that ALL point-and-shoot digital (and conventional) cameras have this problem as well.  Unless you can attach a larger flash to the camera, which isn't an option on point and shoots, this problem will always exist.  Only SLR digital cameras will good pictures in low light with subjects greater than 10 feet away.  The S-40 does have a night scene mode where it makes the shutter very slow so more light is captured - in this mode, the camera will take good low light pictures, but you have to use a tripod for this mode.Overall, for under $200, I highly recommend this camera.  You don't need to spend anything greater as this camera will do the trick.  4.1MB is more good enough for photos as large as 8x10.", "Date": "June 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not as small as I thought", "Author": "C.

Used it quite a bit for my daughters swimming lesson this morning.My old Sony DSC-S50 was just too big to be convienient and finally we upgraded to this newer model.Photos - excellent.

Memory Stick Pro on FINE mode makes for excellent video with sound.  Sure does chew through the space though.  512 MB stick holds just 6 minutes of video.I dropped a single star because I was thinking this camera would be about the same size as the L1, but it really is quite a bit thicker.

Mumtaz \"amumtaz\"", "ReviewID": "R3CJUOAC88CA3I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are seeking a decent camera around US$150 or less with 4 Mega Pixel or better than this is an ideal buy. Like most of sony products, it is easy to use and is of great quality. You can snap photographs in seconds. There is also a great movie mode. So you can make some good movies at 30 fps. This means the movies are full motion and do not seem jerky .... However, if you do not have the camera mounted on a stand your hands motions may create dizzying pictures. So be careful :-)90% of the time, you would want to take pictures at 1Mega Pixel setting. That means, each picture size would be less than 500k. So essentially, the internal memory can take upto 64 images if not more. However, if you get a Memory stick card of atleast 256Mega bytes, you can store over 500 images in the camera.One point of caution. I did not see a direct interface to connect to TV. Nor was any cable provided except USB for PC communications. So if you wanna hook it upto a TV, look for some other camera.I also bought the Sony recharger with batteries. And usually the batteries last me atleast two weeks if not more on one charge. I highly recommend getting rechargables. They may be expensive inititally, but are cheaper in the long haul.", "Date": "October 30, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "Elinor Denney", "ReviewID": "R296OF6YXSKP3T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll begin with the short review, since I know some of you just want to know the basics:-Takes excellent pictures in close up, zoom, and at all times of day.  The only time the picture is compromised is at full zoom if you are trying to shoot without a tripod.  The candlelight setting can also turn out sort of orange if there is enough light in the room, in which case you can simply change to another setting.-The camera is light and extremely portable.  I haven't even bought a case for it yet and am carrying it around in my purse or backpack in the \"sock\" that it arrived with.-With a 256MB memory stick you can take up to 10 minutes of video, or a combination of many pictures and a few minutes of video.  (I haven't ever filled up the card just taking pictures, though I have filled it once with 8 minutes of video and around 50 pictures.)-The pictures are very high quality at the default resolution and come out quite large.  Every time I wanted to upload to the internet I scaled them down a bit so it didn't take forever to load, but I love that it takes such big pictures.  I have set a picture of the sunset that I took several days ago as my desktop picture and it is not at all distorted and is very clear.  The video is also higher quality than I expected and the audio is clear.-The camera is extremely easy to use with a little common sense.  I haven't even had to open the manual because everything has been so self-explanatory.  I can change settings at will and the camera adjusts instantly.  I even figured out how to turn the sound off without looking in the manual.-Something of huge importance to me, this camera takes pictures quickly. There isn't a huge lag time between pictures as the flash reloads, like with so many digital cameras.  You can point and click to your heart's desire without getting the annoying phenomenon of pushing down the button and having nothing happen.Now for the long-winded version:I've had my Cybershot for nearly a month and have been extremely pleased with my purchase.  For the past four years I have been dealing with my family's 1.3MP digital camera that, while certainly a reasonably mid-ranged camera at the time, is now quite outdated and due for an upgrade.After reading as many reviews as I could get my hands on and asking the advice of anyone I knew who owned a camera, I decided on the Sony Cybershot because it had the most positive reviews, and a friend of my mother's owned the 5.1MP version and loved it.  I had originally intended to buy a cheaper camera that didn't have quite as good of reviews, but now that I have the Cybershot I'm so glad that I didn't.I got mine for $164 from one of the Amazon Marketplace sellers and it came more quickly than I even hoped it would.  The camera was so much lighter than I expected, even with batteries it is scarcely heavier than my cell phone.  It is also very compact and fits nicely in the palm of your hand, but isn't so small that you feel like you might drop it. I would recommend keeping the wrist strap on at all times, however, if only for your own peace of mind.As for picture taking and quality, I have no complaints.  The first thing I did was go outside and take some close-ups of my mother's sunflowers and the pictures came out beautifully.  The colors were vibrant and the picture was in focus; what more could I want?  Some people have complained of fuzzy night time shots, and while I agree that it is difficult to get a perfectly clear picture with the full zoom extended without a tripod, I am still happy with the vitality of the colors in night time pictures.A huge plus that I hadn't even taken into account was the video ability of this camera.  As I was shopping I noticed that you practically couldn't find a 4MP digital camera that didn't have a video feature, I honestly didn't think that I would ever use it.  Was I ever wrong.  Within the first week of owning the camera I got a perfect opportunity to use the video feature; a situation where the subjects I was trying to capture were too far away to get decent pictures, and were moving to fast to get a clear shot.  I decided to try out the video feature in this, the most demanding context I could think of, and it performed wonderfully.  The video was of surprisingly good quality considering it was taken by something not intended for capturing high quality video, and the audio was also clear and recognizeable.  I consider this to be a major plus.I still can't get over the portability of this camera, compared to my clunky old 1.3MP which weighed surely twice as much.  I would never just cart that thing around wherever I went, but my new camera comes with me everywhere.  It is amazing how many more photo opportunities you find when you have a good camera with you.I also found the menus to be completely self-explanatory (I haven't even cracked the manual yet) and with a 256MB memory stick I can take up to 10 minutes of video or as many pictures as I can stand of the deer in my back yard.As I mentioned above, I was so happy with how quickly I could take pictures.  With the old 1.3MP it took forever for the flash to load and I would often miss shots because I couldn't get the timing to work out.  With this camera that problem no longer exists, and I am immensely pleased to be rid of it.All in all this is an excellent camera and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in an easily used digital camera that takes decent shots.", "Date": "August 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "Does not work!", "Author": "F.

It turned off randomly by itself, with the lense cover open.  However, since the lense was open, the camera would not turn back on until after very many tries.  Then, it would only turn on in review mode, but as soon as you switch it to camera mode, it would shut off again.  I thought my camera was defective so Amazon.com sent me a replacement.

Jacobe as a comment to Rachel Ellen's Sept 4, 2006 post. This is a good camera when it's working but unfortunately, while within it's Sony warranty period, my S40 suffered 3 episodes of the white-screen-of-death (apparently, based on other reviews, this is not an uncommon problem and is seemingly, a design/software flaw that Sony is not acknowledging).  This problem relates to the LCD screen turning white and the camera becoming inoperable. Changing the batteries does not fix this problem. I sent the camera for warranty repair twice. First time back (diagnosed as \"Main Power Flex\" problem), the repaired S40 lasted less than a month. After the second repair (diagnosed as \"battery door problem\"), the white-screen death appeared again within one week! By then, I knew that I either had a lemon or that the authorized Enfield, CT, repair facility wasn't good at what they do. I also did not want to spend any more time and money sending it in for a futile 3rd repair. Wish I had read Jacobe's resetting tip earlier - would have saved me all the needless aggravation. Jacobe's solution is to reset by pressing all 3 buttons on the back of the camera(MENU; Display/LCD on/off; Image size/Delete) simultaneously while turning on the camera. This is a workable but short-term solution as the camera, with its integral flaw, will continue to \"excite\" with the unpredictable white screens of death. Imagine having the paparazzi shot-of-the-century just a click away and your S40 coughs up a white screen and refuses to work.

I am very impressed with this product.It delivers professional results and is easy to use.  Newbees like me can get great results with the AUTO mode, then when you have the time to do so, you can experiment with the manual settings for custom results.  The nice thing about digital (with a computer) is that you're not throwing away expensive materials (ie film) in order to learn.  You can just delete your failures and try again.  When you get a pic that looks printworthy you can either print it using your PC or you can connect the USB cord (supplied) directly to a photoprinter (if said printer has a standard called PICTBRIDGE). There are many settings that you can control (ISO sensitivity, EV, White Balance and other settings that shutterbugs are familiar with) or you can set it to AUTO and let the camera set it up for you.  It uses JPEG format and you can get much detail setting it to 4 megapixels but these pics turn out BIG (almost 2 megs).  If you don't want your pics that big you can set them down to 3.2, 3,1, or VGA and they still look very good, but they are smaller and easier to store.  The camera is about the size of a bar of soap and fits very easily into a pocket. You can also take \"webcam\" type movies. The documentation comes in print and on the CD and is excellent, going into much detail on how to use the manual settings for best results.  My only disappointment is with the Photo Editing program that comes on the CD.  This program dosen't offer much for editing your pics on a PC (no problem for me though.  I have PhotoDeluxe). If you have a good editing program that came with your printer (or scanner) you might want to use it instead.  I think the software included with this camera is more suited for HandyCams (video cameras).The camera has 32 megs of onboard memory which allows you to shoot 16 pics at 4 MPs, 20 at 3MPs, 50 at 1 MPs and 196 at VGA.It has a slot for a memory stick if you choose to buy one. If you do decide to buy one of these cameras, do yourself a favor and buy some rechargable NIMH batteries, because I'll tell you ( and anybody with digicam experience knows this) alkaline batteries do not cut it with this camera.  It comes with 2 alkalines and I think I took all of about 12 pictures before they were WIPED OUT!  I then tried some regular Everready alkalines I had just bought and they wouldn't even power it up.  The NIMH's that I bought work excellent and last long in between recharges. So, all in all, would I recommend this camera?

I take photos of jeans for my A1Jeans.com store.  Also used it for some \"before\" photos of my daughter's new (and not so clean) apartment, in case we need them come time to get back her deposit.The menu lettering is very tiny & my eyesight is not so great, so my only complaint is having a hard time reading menu options.  But, I did figure out how to take super high-definition photos, and also great small-file photos that are great for emails or my internet photos.  Still great definition for such small files.Definitely does eat up the batteries.  Even though I knew it did, because of the reviews here, I was still amazed at just how quickly they were used up.Also, the camera's memory really is SUPER limited.  If you don't get the memory stick, which I plan to do, you can expect to have it filled up only half-way through a kid's birthday party, if you even get that far, and if you're not close to a computer to download the photos, you're done.  In taking photos of my daughter's apartment, I took them in high-definition & had to stop to download them to the computer probably 5 times.  I'll definitely be buying a few memory sticks for any type of outing & buy batteries at Costco in bulk!  But, with just about 1/2 hour of learning the basics of this camera, I can just click & shoot & get great photos.  Gotta love Sony for a great product.Oh, and the software that came with the camera is incredibly easy to use.  I'm so impressed.  Didn't need any time for \"learning curve\" with the software.  Just flip a switch on the camera, attach the USB cable from the camera to a USB port on your computer, open up the software & click on the big button that says \"automatically copy photos,\" and voilla!  Then, the photos show up as a gallery & at the top of the screen there are a few simple icons....rotate right, left...  The easiest photo software I've ever seen.  Great for an amateur or someone who just doesn't want to deal with anything other than a quick download, rotate the photo & that's it.

Bought it about 3 years ago for about $350. My biggest complaint was the lag time between turning it on and being able to take a picture, about 30 seconds in my case. Aside from that, it took very good pictures. I wasn't too concerned with megapixel size back then as I use Genuine Fractals software to increase the size of the picture while keeping the quality high. Last week I saw the Sony DSC-S40 advertised for less than a $150,  and after reading the positive reviews on it, figured how could I not buy a 4 megapixel camera which was way less costly than my Olympus and a lot less thinner.First thing that impressed me was how quickly I could snap a picture. Within 5 seconds from powering on, I was taking a picture. From my Olympus I learned to get used to missing photo opportunities and quick action. Anyway, the instructions for the Sony were simple and although I wished it were flatter, for what I was paying I was extremely happy. Took some family pictures in New York and first thing I noticed was the camera was terrible with movement. A lot of my pictures came out blurry, even after changing settings a few time. Got home and uploaded the remaining pictures and began to process them, and problem number two kicked in: picture noise. The faces didn't look right, so I zoomed in and could clearly see spots around the face. First thing I did was look at the lens to see if it was dirty, it wasn't. I actually was confused. With Sony's reputation and it being a newer technology, I really thought it would blow my Olympus away.Bottom line, my old Olympus blows the Sony away. I took the Sony back yesterday and am doing more research on digitals from other makers.  After this sorry performance, I don't even want to waste my time looking at any other Sony cameras.

It was my first digital camera and up until recently I did not consider changing it. I did not face any sort of technical problem with my Sony, no white screens or anything at all. I used it quite a lot too, I snap 500+ pictures on average a month.The things that I did not like about the camera were:1- It eats up batteries. I had to buy rechargeable batteries and a charger to keep up with it.2- It is a little thick, but that is not a major flaw, at least to me.3- The little memory space. Anyone using this camera would have to buy memory cards to save material on as the original memory is insignificant.4- The video it captures is jumpy mostly.5- I would have to concentrate really well when taking pictures and steady my hand very, very well. This camera tends to take shaky pictures if not very stable.6- The flash is very strong, and although you can bring its level down, it still produces too much light on close subjects.I listed the things that have annoyed me over the past two years, but those aside, I love this camera. The batteries and the memory card ceased to be a problem when I bought the rechargeables and the cards, but the only thing that remained disturbing to this day is the tendency of the camera to take shaky pictures. The small LCD screen does not allow you to  check if the pictures are shaky unless you zoom in well enough.The good things about this camera range from its usability and price to its accessibility of functions and practicality. It allowed me to take amazing pictures and memorable videos. I think it is a good starting choice for beginners and it does not take any time at all to understand the various functions and features.

I knew other people who had sonys and were happy.  Initally I was Disapointed. Then I viewed the interactive CD that come with the camera. This was very informative and easy to use. Using the knowedge one gets from the CD you can take great pictures. You must know something about how any camera works to take great pictures. This is true for ANY camera (35mm or digital). Put it in the right settings (cloady, sunny, dark back ground) and it does great. Dependent on the situation(low light) you could need a tripod.... but this is true of any camera.  No one makes a camera that you can put on auto and hope that every single picture is going to be great.... There is a thinking process involved. But once you know the limitations of this camera (or any camera) you can take good pictures.  Like the video that comes with this also.  Camera uses AA batteries. Get rechargables- they pay for themself fast. Digital cameras EAT batteries. Rechargeable batteries are a wise investment  I can also plug this camera into any windows xp computer with a USB port and extract the pictures. Could not do that with the Canon with out preloading software.  Camera is also very light weight  I think I will keep this camera for a long time...

There are only two drawbacks to the product.1. There is no self-timer, so you can forget about taking pictures of yourself without holding the camera at arm's length!  This was a disappointment for me, because I love taking self-timed pictures, as I am frequently alone when I take pictures.2. The LCD on the back of the camera is very small compared to similar priced models of other brand cameras.  I knew this before purchasing the camera, but I decided to sacrifice it for the brand name.  Sony cameras have always been great quality!Those two drawbacks left me rating this just under 5 stars.  Those are the only two things I would have changed about the camera.On the positive side, the camera takes WONDERFUL images.  I have not tried anything less than the highest quality, however.  I have a 256MB Memory Stick Pro which I purchased with my camera, and it allows me to store just over 100 pictures at the highest quality.  Make sure you purchase the correct type of memory stick for the camera.  There are several versions of the same memory out there.Another bonus of this camera is the ability to create folders on your memory stick to hold different sets of pictures.  This assists you when it comes to downloading or printing your images, so you do not have to sort them out later.  Just switch folders when you switch your photography subject matter.The camera includes automatic red-eye removal, as well as the ability to auto-focus in dark environments.The DSCS40 has the ability to take photos at night, but if it is too dark, be sure you have a tripod, as the shutter will stay open longer, leaving your image blurry with the slightest movements.The documentation for the camera is a little poor.  You will have to read and re-read it if you do not know digital camera basics.  Most of the documentation is included on a CD-ROM which also gives you hints on how to take better pictures.Overall, this is an excellent camera for your money, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for an entry-level camera that performs like a champ.", "Date": "February 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "DO NOT ORDER THIS CAMERA!!!

I then put in rechargeable batteries, fully charged, and for a while that worked, I thought that was the solution. Then about a week later it shut off AGAIN. I re-charged the batteries, and it kept doing it on FULLY CHARGED batteries.My next step was to call Sony. They had me send it in for a warranty investigation. I did, and they called and stated that there was nothing wrong with it, except the batteries. They would not listen to my plea that I've already tried the batteries, and it still didn't work. They would not listen when I asked for a refund. I asked why I couldn't obtain a refund even if I simply changed my mind.

I doubt it! There is nothing in the owners guide, or online at their website to indicate that you need to use any specific type of batteries.

This is the first digital camera I've seen that has a visial laser that shoots out to determine lighting and the focus. Pointing lasers at people's eyes is always a bad idea. The camera's manual says that the laser is \"safe\" but it recommends not aiming at people's eyes (interesting). If you have children, do not buy this camera because this laser is not a good idea. My previsous CyberShot and most other digital cameras (high and low cost) do not have this visial laser - why this camera does I'll never know.* Zoom lense - nice feature to have - glad its there. However, if you use the zoom, you have to be extra stable before taking the picture or it will result in a blurry picture.* Picture Stability - The camera has no automatic picture stabilization - make sure you are solid before taking the picture - I have many shots that I deleted because I moved just alittle bit. This occurs even when not using the zoom.* Memory - I've gone with the 3MP setting because the aspect ratio matches a 4x6 photo.* Flash - As stated above, it takes 5 seconds to recharge. Also, using the flash usually maeans the color will be whited-out (i.e., not great quality).* Picture Quality - Excellent when the lighting is good* Video - I haven't used it much - I pull out the digital video camera for that.* Price - Average camera for the price - This is a much better camera when outside in good lighting. However, it gets 2 stars because I expect more from Sony and for the price, there were better digital cameras I could have purchased.* Summary - My previous 2MP Cybershot left me with a great opinion of Sony's cameras. The DSCS40 Cybershot has damaged that reputation. I will definitely check Sony out for my next camera, but the usually reliable Amazon reviews really missed the boat on this one. People giving this 4-5 stars must have had really bad experiences with previous cameras to give the DSCS40 such a high rating. I don't know else how to explain it. I will be sure to test the camera and not just go off of reviews before purchasing in the future.", "Date": "February 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "bad", "Author": "Shaaron Elisha \"Ron\"", "ReviewID": "R2QCISNXA2LNQ8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "bad very bad, i bought two and both screens went white, sometimes they just turn off for fun.

Yu \"Binkari\"", "ReviewID": "R2RZ4L2R52FDBB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After successfully breaking the battery to my old Kodak digital camera, it was time for a replacement. I ended up buying this Cybershot due to its affordability. Not being an avid photographer, 4MP was more than enough for my needs (I generally take pictures at 1MP anyways).I will say this now: I was unfortunate enough to purchase a defective camera. Like many other reviewers, my camera began suffering problems very early on. The major problem was the camera suddenly turning off with the lens still out when trying to switch modes (such as switching from picture to review mode) and being unable to turn back on until I replaced the current batteries (which were often practically new) with fresh ones. Needless to say, I have gone through scores of fresh batteries or brands varying from Energizer, to Duracell, to special camera batteries due to this problem. The occurence seems random and unrelated to actual battery brand and life, but most often due to switches between different picture modes.Sony has chosen not to acknowledge this as a defect, despite my calls. They would not replace the camera, stating that the problem would be easily fixed by replacing the batteries. While true, it is a waste of my money and time to have to put in new batteries after only an hour or two of taking pictures. Because of this fatal flaw, the camera has earned the lowest rating from me.That said...PICTURE QUALITY was above average: the colors were saturated and very true-to-life. At lower MP ranges, the distortion was almost nil, perhaps due to the quality of the lens (Zeiss is arguably one of the best lenscrafters out there). The major problem with this camera is that there is a noticeable delay between you pressing the button and the shutter actually going off. Many times, this resulted in very blurred pictures, particularly when taking pictures of still objects like friends posing. Oddly enough, the camera took wonderfully sharp pictures of things in motion--such as rollercoasters and dancers on stage.CAMERA QUALITY, aside from the major, camera-breaking battery issue, was good. The camera is solid and sturdy. The plastic exterior feels a little cheap compared to the brushed metal bodies of other cameras, however. The best part of this camera is probably its lens: a genuine Carl Zeiss lens that allows for very accurate shots at virtually every zoom level. The menu is easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to press. The shutter button is particularly fun to pet.This model has been discontinued since the writing of this review. However, if you find one for cheap and are willing to take the risk of buying a battery-hogging dud, then the DSC-S40 is a faithful picture taker for those with steady hands or a love for Formula One racecars in motion.", "Date": "July 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R9X97H06XJE4C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my camera about a week ago.

They tried to encourage me returning all stuffs I ordered and get full refund with no postage required.I believe that is not a right service manner for a retailer.  In fact, I need a camera for my vacation next day.  During the vacation, I emailed back and for 8 times with the customer services.  In which, there were 8 service representatives replied my email.  But they did not read back the email content.  Anyway, they pissed me off very much.  Finally, I got only $38.00 refund for the missing items.
