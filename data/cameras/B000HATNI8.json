It's obvious to any G series owner that this camera drops the flip screen and RAW format.  Get over it.Making up for the loss of the flip screen is a higher resolution, bigger fixed screen.  It's much nicer than the screen on the G6.  I didn't like the loss at first, but i realized i never used it that much except as a means of protecting the screen.  It's actually nice to take the camera out , turn it on, and start shooting without having to flip the LCD back into place.The loss of RAW does not affect me.  I'm someone who takes many photos especially of my newborn but I don't do a lot of post processing.  RAW files are huge.  The pics generally are good enough and digital has always allowed me to take more than necessary and delete any bad ones.  The pics taken with the G7 are great quality.  I think this is an issue affecting primarily pros who use this as a second camera, but there is great software out there for jpegs.  And most people couldn't tell a jpeg pic from a RAW pic.  I think Canon erred on this as i don't think this is the issue that will force people to buy its more profitable dslr cameras.  DSLR will always be superior for those action shots or low noise high ISO pics.  Maybe it will return in the G8 if the series continues.  No matter what, Canon is taking a beating in every review for this.Instead of focusing on what this doesn't have that the G6 had, let's focus on what this one has instead.  IS.  Image Stableizer.  This is very important.  It allows you to take the flash off and take hand held shots in low light.  No more blurry pics.Digic III.  Allows faster processing and overall performance.  Face detection is also new and seems to work nicely.Hotshoe.  Very few non dslr cameras have this although i'm sure the average consumer doesn't care.6x zoom.  Screen.  And ability to take wide screen pics.The camera feels very solid and seems smaller than the g6 and of course looks better with the black.  The controls and menus are laid out easier IMO.  10 MP isn't that big of a deal to me although i'm sure it has it's mass appeal.  I think 8 might've been better, but i'm not complaining.Macros are much easier to take with this camera vs the G6.  Again, IS helps big time.Lens cap.  What lens cap?  This one doesn't need one.  Prior G cameras had that loose one that always seemed to pop off.Battery life seems shorter though so you may want that extra battery this time.  (never bought an extra for G6).  And it takes SD media which i really don't care for but it is more compatible for me since my laptop has one built in.  The movie mode is much improved as well although i have a camcorder for that...it's still nice to have.Bottom line, 599 is a lot to pay for a camera these days (i paid more for the G2 at the time and thought it was pretty cool back then).  But this is a step short of stepping into the expensive and bulky dslr world.  You get a lot of tech in this camera.  I've owned a G2 and a G6 (that died on me) and this is quickly becoming my favorite by far.  It's much faster due to the processor.  And you get all the manual controls you could want plus the option to add external flash.  For point & shoot consumers, just put it on auto which makes my wife happy.", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "SUPERB CAMERA", "Author": "I. L. Celnik \"leoncel\"", "ReviewID": "R3F3HRGNADYI23", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All of my live I have been a SLR user, from film to digital. I'm not a pro, but consider myself a serious amateur. I take tons of pictures, especially during my travels around the world, and was tired of carrying all of my photo gear (Canon 30D, three lenses, flash and accessories) with me all the time. It's not only the burden and weight in your shoulder or neck  -try walking with it in the middle of a tropical hot day for a couple of hours; besides, you can't freely leave it in your hotel's room, say, by night or for long periods. Not to mention street robbery, and conspicuous looking. At the end, you become a slave of it, restricting your movements; and there are times you painfully wished you haven't brought it with you at all. So, I decided it was time to try something that will fulfill my photographic needs, but could fit just in my pocket. During a long time, I looked in the internet and in magazines for a little camera that could satisfy almost all of my requirements, without sacrificing quality. I studied lots of items, brands and prices: the immense majority wouldn't do it at all. Recently, Canon launched the Powershot G7. I bought one and can't be happier with my decision. I'm full aware of its limitations against an SLR and try to overcome its shortcomings, namely its tiny sensor. I still use my SLR for my important work, but now I only travel with the G7 in my pocket and get very sharp, colorful and big pictures from every trip; photo quality is outstanding. My only and very strong complaint is its lack of RAW. I can't find a good reason why Canon did without it in this otherwise superb camera. It's not the cost: RAW is software, not hardware. And even if they considered its proprietary CR.2 RAW a costly value, they could have used Adobe's free licensed DNG (by the way, \u00bfwhy doesn't every brand include this? It's a mystery). It doesn't require additional space in camera's mechanism and if they didn't want novice photographers to be overwhelmed with it, they just could have buried it in some place of the menu. Otherwise, I definitively recommend this camera as a second one for your SLR or even a first if you don't need all of the later features.", "Date": "November 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent Point and Shoot from Canon", "Author": "RonAnnArbor", "ReviewID": "RXMX8EXHYHBXC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is truly an excellent Point and Shoot from Canon. I have been using it for a week now, and it provides consistently excellent images time after time across all shooting conditions. The excellent 6x optical zoom allows 28 to 200 zoom (35 mm equivalent) which is an excellent range for a point and shoot, and the Image Stabilization works like a dream. Some have complained about this camera lacking RAW. I shoot primarily with a dSLR and have NEVER used RAW so it is a feature I (and 95 percent of people toward whom this camera is marketed) will never need and will never miss. If you need RAW then this is not the camera for you. On the other hand, if you need RAW you probably should not be looking at a Point and Shoot camera anyway. Canon has wisely done away with RAW in both of their high-end compact cameras (The G7 as well as the S80.) The camera is a bit larger than the standard pocketable point-and-shoot fare, but it is small enough to toss in your purse, backpack, or cargo pants pocket. Easily fits in a coat pocket. There is no purple fringing in any of the shots I have taken so far (about 500) and there is no barrel distortion nor vignetting noted. This will most likely become my camera of choice at present when not using my dSLR. In fact, I plan on bringing only this trip to Europe with me at the end of the month, in lieu of dragging along a whole camera kit. Very Very happy with this major image upgrade, and wonderful feature set of this camera.ADDM: After return from a week in Europe, I can report that the camera performed up to expectations, and that the images are just as stunning as those that I would expect from my dSLR. All landscape photos are sharp; museum and interior photos are sharp and exposed correctly, and the different modes (shutter, aperture etc) are easy to use on the fly. This remains my current recommendation for the best point-and-shoot out there right now.NEW ADDM 8/20/07 Canon Today announced an updated version of this camera to be available in October of this year and called the Powershot G9. It incorporates a 12 mp sensor and puts RAW back into the camera. If you are planning on buying a G7, you might want to wait a few months and purchase the G9 -- it will be available for 499.99 list price when released. If you don't need RAW, then there will be no other major features that would make it your while to wait (there is practically no difference between 12MP and 10 MP at this level of camera).", "Date": "October 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Better, But I Was Hoping for More. . .", "Author": "J. Wong", "ReviewID": "R3G85HF0B0677X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When the G7 was announced, I hoped it would be the \"crossover\" camera I've been waiting for.  My dream crossover is the one-piece compact or mid-size camera that zooms to at least 200mm, and can produce clean 8X10's under a wide range of lighting conditions.  It's the one I'd take on a long trip so I didn't have to lug my DSLR and lenses around.I've fiddled with my G7 now for about a month.  It's better than any non-DSLR digital I've used, but I'm still lugging my DSLRs.In good light, the G7 can produce images that rival a DSLR.  The glass is great and the 10 mp sensor gets good resolution.  It's weaknesses are noise and limited dynamic range.  Getting the most of this camera is sometimes a little tricky.  It tends to blow highlights in high contrast situations.  Fine tree branches and hair against a bright sky get broken up.  Turning down the constrast one notch and under-exposing by 1/3 a stop helps preserve the highs and some of the fine details.  You can introduce more light and contrast later in photoshop.  Pay attention to the histogram.  The results can be impressive, but you do have to work it. I can live without raw, but I do miss not having an Adobe RGB color space.The image stabilization works well.  The G7 focuses fairly quickly.  I appreciate the 210 mm long zoom length, but miss having 28mm at the short end.  Being able to shoot an unlimited number of continuous full size images with a compact is very cool.  The in-camera flash is limited, but the hot shoe comes to the rescue.  I've gotten some really nice indoor shots using a Canon external flash, albeit at the loss of the G7's portability (my external flash is twice the size of the G7!).All in all, I'm a bit disappointed.  I thought Canon would produce that extremely versatile fixed lens zoom this year that would be a worthwhile DSLR substitute.  While the G7 is as good or better at ISO 200 and 400 than any other non-DSLR camera I've used, you've definitely got noise at ISO 400, and many of the ISO 200 images are noisier than I care for.  The G7's dynamic range is at least as good as any other compact I've shot, but I have to believe Canon could have done better.  I think they fell victim to the pixel-wars, and packed too many pixels into too small a sensor.  I didn't want more pixels.  I wanted bigger and better pixels and a bigger lens, that captured more light, preserved more tonal gradation, and produced noise-free images at ISO 200, and maybe even 400.The G7's a better one piece zoom.  But it's not what I hoped for.", "Date": "December 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "D. Bannister", "ReviewID": "R3O8I7RI62TZBM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About six months ago I bought the SD700IS point and shoot Canon camera and I love it. It is quick. Responsive. And takes a pretty darn good picture. So even I was surprised when I encountered the G7. It is larger and heavier but offers so much more than the 700IS.The appeal to me was it degree of manual operation which include, Program, Shutter and Aperature priorities and Full Manual. None of the Canon cameras in the SD line offer this flexibility. The other of course was the 10 megapixel sensor.After a little over a week with the camera I can say it is one sweet machine. It fits in your hand and has great weight. Enough to feel substantial but not overwhelming. Some have said that the camera feel slick and they have to be careful with it. I would agree.Power up is quick and the lens retracts with good speed.It has an amazing macro function that is worth the price of the machine alone. I love this feature.In addition you can vary the flash output in every mode but Auto. A very good feature for those of us who tend to be too close to their subjects.I wonder if the ISO dial at the top was really needed or whether that function could have been accomodated within a menu.And so far the pictures have been excellent for clarity and colour.SLR's do not interest me. They are too cumbersome and I have been there and done that. With point and shoots I take ten times the pictures and have a 100 times the fun. But I have to say that graduating to the G7 has been a great decision.It gives you more opportunity to be creative and to control more of the shot and the environment in which the camera is operating.One thing: This is not an intuitive camera. It takes time to learn. Keep the manual close by for you will undoubtably be referring to it frequently for the first few weeks.All and all an excellent purchase.", "Date": "December 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great little camera -- perfect adjunct to a DSLR", "Author": "R. Kaufmann", "ReviewID": "R55V1UXRKK436", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(Update: I just bought the G9.  It's NIGHT AND DAY a better camera, and a highly worthy upgrade.  RAW mode is fantastic, and IQ is significantly improved.  I also like the new LCD.)I got one of the first batches of G7s, and I'm glad that I did. Most of the reviews have not been able to get over the lack of a RAW option -- and have missed the point of the camera altogether: it is designed to be the perfect backup and complement to Canon digital SLRs.I own a Canon EOS 20D with all the trimmings. Carrying the 20D, a strobe, and a few lenses isn't a subtle undertaking; I'm very grateful my wife puts up with me hauling this junk all over the place. But anyone who does this knows why I've been on the hunt for the holy grail -- a little pocket camera that can go anywhereI've bought a lot of pocket cameras over the past few years, and they all go through the same \"cycle of life:\"  1. I look at a new lovely, shiny, beautiful little camera. It fits in my pocket! And it has umpty-ump megapixels! I have to get this one! (Wife rolls eyes.)  2. I take the new toy everywhere, and shoot lots of pictures.  3. I look at the pictures and quickly decide: (1) any picture using the built-in strobe is totally useless, and (2) even the daylight pictures look terrible. (Wife listens to me complain.)  4. At the next possible opportunity, I get rid of the darned thing. I actually have pretty good taste, so the recipient is grateful (and has what they want and need). My wife is really happy she doesn't have to listen to my whining anymore.  5. I go back to hauling around a heavy backpack and looking like a character from \"What The Duck!\"  6. Return to step 1.The G7 is the first pocket camera that might actually break the cycle. The two main reasons are: (1) I can actually use my external strobe. My wireless transmitter fits in the hot shoe, and I often set one or two strobes on their little \"mini stands\" (Canon folks will know what I mean). The whole package is subtle enough to not get me yelled at. The pictures that I get as a result are very, very nice. One example: [...]The second reason is that the lens is actually good enough to do a decent job. Yes, I wish it could go wider (I'm a total fisheye junky!), and yes, I wish it could go longer (I also love my 70-300 DO), but the lens takes great pictures and is useful enough for 90% of what I want to do.All other aspects of this camera pale in comparison with those two. Yeah, the image stabilization is great. Yeah, it takes nice videos. Yeah, it lacks RAW. Yeah, you have to buy a spare battery. Yeah, the G6 might have been a better camera in its day. But, I can take the G7 anywhere, and the images it takes are pleasing.And to everyone crying about the G6: Yes, the G6 was a great camera, but I didn't buy one. It was just a little too big to carry around everywhere. Please, go visit a G7 and hold it in your hand. You'll want to own it. You want more than my silly opinion? Luminous Landscape wrote a somewhat mixed-to-negative review of the G7, and then gave the camera back to Canon. A little while later they wrote a postscript sheepishly admitting that they went ahead and bought one with their own money -- for many of the reasons I've outlined above.RAW, shmaw, this is a great camera. Anyone who has a Canon digital SLR (and an external strobe) should own one.p.s. One other glaring omission: the silly thing doesn't have a battery meter!  It's a lot like the old VW bugs -- you knew you ran out of gas when your motor conked out!p.p.s.

Levin", "ReviewID": "R3N26OTYMN63A8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera assuming it would shoot like an SLR in a size that still makes it packable like a point-and-shoot. For the most part, it does. I upgraded from an older, simpler Powershot S400, hoping to get back some of the manual control from my old film SLR days. Certainly the manual aperture and shutter speed modes (which use an attractive on-screen display along with the dial ring on the back of the body) are very accessible and convenient. A setting lower than f2.8 would certainly be nice, however. What I didn't expect was to be making so much use of the auto and program modes... silly me, that's probably what I paid all the $$$ for in the first place. The face recognition, and advanced metering capability really helped with some tricky shooting situations. You can wow your friends with the face tracking on screen as the subject or camera moves...The most noticeable drawback (and this has been previously mentioned) is the high noise of that tiny CCD with 0.01 Gigapixels crammed into it. It's really pretty bad in some situations. Be VERY careful not to forget and leave the camera in a higher ISO mode, or pictures (even in daylight) can be ruined by graininess. True, you'll get some photo's at the higher ISO modes that you would not have gotten otherwise, but the result is a bit of a disappointment.Props go out for the superb job with the image stabilization. Seems like that's where the investment really paid off (by me and by Canon). With a steady hand-held position, 1/15 shutter speeds do not present a problem (I do recommend snapping off a couple shots though, just ot be sure).On the non-shooting side, the options available to manage and selectively delete pictures stored on the SD card are very good. I was especially happy to see I could clip videos down to the desired length right there on the camera. Who wants to carry a hundred MB of video, when all you want is 10 seconds that's on the clip? Nice job on that.A strange/annoying feature (haven't figured out how to disable it) is that if you zoom in on an image to view it, and delete it or move onto the next image on the card, the camera holds the zoom to previous level of the last image. Sort of odd.Battery life has been fine, compared to other camera's I've owned. For a camera this size, it seems like they could have worked a little harder to fit AA's into it.Overall, I can see this camera and I are going to get along fine. It fits in my old camera pouch I used to carry my SD400 around in. It shoots awesome pictures in daylight, and does well in low light as long as I my hand is steady and I don't b*tch too much about the graininess. Prices look like they're starting to come down, and I'd say it's a steal at about $400 if anyone wants to wait.", "Date": "March 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "jpeg vs. RAW", "Author": "Joe West", "ReviewID": "R30A64TUTSZGV2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just noticed the reviewer who was upset that the new Canon G7 does not offer a RAW format.  As a professional photographer... just wanted to offer a couple of comments on that subject.  In my humble opinion, shooting in RAW format, in many cases, is a waste of time... even in most professional work situations.  The extra steps in workflow, required by the RAW format, are simply not justified in the majority of photography work situations.  I have sold many prints, posters, and stock images produced from jpeg files.  I have also been published in magazines and travel books using jpeg images almost exclusively.  Many photographers have come to view the jpeg format as the \"amatuer\" format and RAW as the \"professional\" format, which I believe is really not accurate.  I know a lot of professional photographers who make extensive use of the jpeg format (no matter what camera they are using).  I have not found a photogographer or editior, yet, who can actually tell the difference in a print produced from a RAW file and one produced from a high quality jpeg file out of the same camera.  I have had this same discussion with a former photographer from National Geographic.  He stated that he could not tell the difference in a print from a jpeg file and a RAW file either.  He said that he, always, shoots in jpeg format.  Yes, I understand the additional ability to \"tweak\" an image in RAW, but if the image is correctly exposed to begin with... very little \"tweaking\" should be necessary anyway...  and working in jpeg is a much faster and more efficient workflow for me.  Just my opinion, but I could care less that the G7 does not offer a RAW format.  It seems like a great camera to me.  Looking forward to trying one out.

The image stabalizer is a tremendous enhancement for non-flash photography, but is also a tremendous enhancement WITH flash!  This allows the use of slower shutter speeds to help the background come out in the photo, while also allowing some available light to strike our subject, giving us a more realistic, less \"cardboard cutout\" look.The camera looks sharp, and has a solid feel in the hands and while operating the controls.  The battery system has reasonably good performance, and is the same battery found in the Digital Rebel XT & XTi series.The new memory card system is superior to the older CF.  SD & SDHC are much, much less prone to accidental damage to improper insertion, damage that may very easily exceed $100 in repair bills (and weeks of lost shots).Compared to previous G series, this one is much smaller, although not pocket size, a bit big for many purses.  While lacking a rotaty LCD, the new, wide angle LCD allows the camera to be much thinner, while still giving reasonable performance at odd angles.

Some nice new additions to functionality include the `face finding' exposure/focusing, multiple scenes functionality and anti camera shake which works excellently.6. The 10 meg sensor is overkill and gives a lot of detail allowing a lot of room for cropping.Not so great:1.

The shrinking of the battery compartment from earlier models takes away a natural grip.4. The new control layout is excellent, but becomes a little fiddly because of the size of the whole unit.5. The tripod screw thread is right next to the cover for the battery/memory compartment so make sure the battery is charged and there is plenty of space on the card if you're going to us a tripod.6. Even using Canon's smallest external flash on the hotshoe makes the camera extremely unweildy.7.

I found that the G7 might fit the description. Here's my own analysis of its Pros and Cons.***What I liked about it:1- Excellent picture quality outdoor in bright sun.2- Great, large, and really bright 2.5\" LCD monitor even brighter than my $3000 5D EOS.3- Cool clock- Hold the \"power\" and the \"Function Set\" buttons -and you get a-5-seconds Hi-tech time display out of a SCi-Fi movie!4- Size-fits easily in my waist pack- No camera case required.5- Cool AF assisted Green Light -projects light on object being focused (looks like a laser guided weapon in the dark).6- Neat Slide show effects.7- Diving gear available for underwater photography.8- Direct access to ISO (dedicated wheel) and other important functions.9- Image Rotates when you do Verticals to fill up the screen. Rotate the Camera again to horizontal and the image rotates as well to occupy only the middle of the horizontal screen-really cool feature.10- Nice looking Camera-has a nostalgic/classic look and feel.11- Good Zoom Range -35mm equivalent of 35-210mm***What I did NOT like about the G7:1- Grainy picture indoor and anything over ISO 100-200 very bad at ISO 400 and higher.2- Very hard to grab-No grip Unlike the nice grip the G6 had. Could be easily dropped.3- Over-saturated colors especially green appear a bit artificial.4- Unlike my other Canon EOS cameras-No ISO and other information is available in IPhoto (Mac) and other softwares--unless you use canon provided softwares.5- Slower lens than previous model at f/2.8-4.8 (G6 was f/2.0-3.0).6- Camera seems to smudge far away trees rather than showing details--bad details when compared to my EOS 20D or 5D or any Digital SLRs7- Large 10 Megapixel files without any true gain in picture quality when compared to the G6 at 7.1 Megapixel.8- Face priority doesn't always work and you DO get blurry unfocused faces.9-Image stabilizer is Not very effective with this relatively slower Lens. It works, but many minor shakes cause blurry pictures.10- Price is very close to a much much better quality picture Compact DSLR like the new Canon Rebel XTi.11-Picture size favors a less wide photo and more \"square like\" (3648 x 2736) rather than the comparable proportion to 35mm you get with EOS cameras (EOS Rebel XTi at 10.1 megapixels is 3888 x 2592) and other higher quality DSRL.12- SD card provided is only useful for a mere dozen of pictures.13- No More Raw format support which produced stunning and highlty flexible pictures with the G6 and Canon Ulitily softwares.14- Fixed screen rather than flip out screen.***Conclusion:As a proud owner of the excellent Canon EOS 5D, 20D and the Powershot G6, I find 1) the excessive graininess at even Low ISO and 2) slower Lens and 3) No More Compact Flash cards and 4) Battery compatibility with the powerful BP-511A that worked with the Three Excellent Canon Cameras mentioned here made me decide to return this camera and order the new Canon Rebel XTi.

I had given up on Canon point and shoots after seeing the poor quality of the latest Elphs.  I've been pretty happy with the Panasonic and have taken some remarkable photos for an ultra-compact, but the noise on low-light photos was really starting to bother me and there isn't much in the way of available customization.  I've been wanting to step up to a more serious camera with lots of manual features like my old Nikon Coolpix 880, but didn't want to go the DSLR route because I don't have any urge to lug a big camera and all the lenses around.So far, the Canon G7 is making me really happy.  I still have a lot of learning to do, but the pictures I've taken in the last week or so are very high quality.  The amount of detail captured is something to be seen.  Even using the zoom at full extension, the photos are remarkably detailed and you can take some pretty extreme close-ups at 6X.  Evidently you can use the digital zoom to a certain point via cropping without having any detrimental effect on picture quality, but I haven't played with it yet.  Macro mode works very well too.The picture quality a level of magnitude or two higher than my Panasonic.  Colors are rich and appear to be extremely accurate.  The photos look like they've been taken with a high-quality SLR and there's none of the \"video camera\" quality I saw in Canon ultra-compacts.  There is a small amount of noise at ISO400, but still better than any film camera.  Yes, ISO800+ pretty much sucks, but everything below that level is just fine.  If you're really concerned about noise, there are some good cheap or free programs that will do a good job of removing noise from jpegs.The flash in default setting is a bit too powerful for most situations, but you can turn down the flash intensity.  Pictures are sometimes a bit over-exposed, but turning down the EV setting 1 or two steps and makes things much better.  Image stabilization works very well.Unless you like to spend a lot of time in Photoshop, RAW isn't a big deal.  If you take good enough photos, you really don't need it.  DSLR people might not be to happy about lack of RAW, but those coming up from normal point and shoots won't miss anything.  I also couldn't care less about the missing articulated LCD screen from the old G-series cameras.  I find those things to be a pain.  The ability to add wide-angle/telephoto lenses and filters is a great plus.  The camera also features the ability to show you (with the shutter pressed halfway down) EXACTLY how the photo will look after you take it.  No guessing is necessary.This camera isn't perfect and it isn't a no-brainer to take great photos.  However, it takes some astounding quality photos and has most of the features/quality of a full-blown DSLR without much hassle.  The rather steep price is still much cheaper than a DSLR.  I don't think you can get better photos out of a point and shoot.  I'm giving it 5 stars because there literally is no other compact camera that will come closer to a DSLR's flexibility and image quality than this one.", "Date": "January 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "The Real Deal", "Author": "Eliot C.

The ISO wheel on top is a very nice feature. Seems like Canon got it at last.I don't really miss the RAW capability, remote controll and the LCD screen of earlier G series models, because I use it mainly for street photography, and for this use, there's basically no other camera on the market as good as the G7( at this price, I must add). The TTL light metering system works flawlessly on this camera, and having the posibility og choosing spot metering, and setting on AWB, the JPEG images hardly need any retouching( the optical IS works very well, and I'm able to shoot sharp pictures at 1/8s)PROS:- Excellent image quality. The light metering and IS work very well, and the coluor rendition, contrast and sharpness are great throughout the entire range( with one exception; look at cons)- Nicelly designed camera. Not only does it look great, but it feels good in your hands, and the menus are easily accessible. Nice and big LCD screen- Very good build quality. Solid camera that can take a beating.CONS:- Max. aperture at the tele end is above the diffraction limit of this camera. A faster lens or lower pixel density would be better, in my opinion.- The noise levels above ISO 400 are very high, making pictures unusable at ISO 800 and 1600.- Very soft corners at around 50mm focal length( 35mm equiv.). Of course, all zoom lenses are soft at some focal lengths, so I won't hold that against Canon.- Manual focusing is not very good. Would prefer a bigger lens with focusing ring.- The optical viewfinder is my biggest dissapointment. It's way too small, and the parallax error is something Canon should have done something with in the designing stage.In all, it's a great camera, but I would have paid a couple of hundred dollars more for a camera without the flaws I pointed out.

In the plain auto mode, the photos are superior and incredibly clear. They are so sharp, they look like  professional photographs. I take photos in my classroom where the lighting is not very good and the G7 photos come out bright and clear. It is the one camera that I can just print without having to first adjust with the image editing programs. Even the movie clips come out clear and with detail. I took night photos in a parking lot of my car and you could see all the details and the night snapshot option was amazing.

Hagan", "ReviewID": "R2DHB7FY7MK5BA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as a point and shoot for my wife who doesn't like to carry a heavy SLR. I'll occasionally use it when I don't carry my SLR. As a point and shoot, it is quite good. My only real complaint with it is that it has somewhat more pixel noise than I would like and the processing of that noise smudges the picture a bit. However it is very much in line with all of the other 10 megapixel point and shoots that I've looked at. Strangely, I think that this product suffers from the marketing requirement of megapixels rather than using one of the other (lower resolution) sensors that canon has. I admit that I'm being somewhat unfair in that I an comparing it to my dSLR which has a huge advantagein terms of sensor size. I miss the raw option on this camera, but, I completely get why canon dropped it: at this price point, if you want raw, buy an slr.With that out of the way, the camera is fairly small. It has more mass than many comparably sized point and shoots. I believe that this is due to both stronger build quality (it seems fairly tough) and the optics. I like the new user interface that they've added to it from the old version. One thing that suprised me is that it actually has somewhat better controls (imho) than my rebel in that it includes both an ISO knob (with an auto setting) and the regular picture mode knob. Additionally, you can select several scene styles which has preprogramed adjustements. Those appear to be handy in helping have the computer do what you want if you aren't the type to use a camera in \"P\" mode. If you do prefer full program mode, the options on this camera are akin to that of the dslrs in that you can adjust contrast, saturation, etc. Like many point and shoots, the built in flash is prone to red-eye. Unlike many point and shoots, this camera has an actual flash hot-shoe. I've used my 430EX speedlight on this camera with quite good results (if you don't mind doubling the size of the camera). Lastly, this guy takes the same batteries as my old S50 and my RebelXT (or an XTi). This is useful when I go on trips. Some people might prefer AA batteries, but, I've found that the third party replacements for canon NB-2L's are very good for life (often more than 2x the canon batteries) and are very reasonably priced.pros:* very good zoom range for such a small camera.* the lens is pretty fast for a point and shoot* quite high iso settings (one can argue whether a noisy image is better than either a blurry one or none at all, but giving the user a choice is nice)* face priority. I really like this feature, i wish my slr had it as an option. I occasionally will miss faces when taking portraits. This camera is pretty good at identifying faces *staring* at the camera and focusing on them.* E-TTL II hotshoe. Ok, few folks will use this, but those who will will appreciate it* Image stabilization. Really, this is a feature that I think is a must-have these days.* no need for a lens cap. Again, something else which is important for a point and shoot, since they often are tossed into purses or backpacks without too much care/fuss.* fairly fast shutter action for a point and shoot.cons:* high price point* 10mpixel point and shoot sensors are somewhat noisy compared to 6 and 7 megapixel ones.* auto mode tends to favor higher ISO speeds* a bit too much noise reduction for my taste, however it is inline with most other pocket 10mpixel camersWhy only four stars? I wish there was a way to tune the image processing algorithm to turn down the noise reduction - I often prefer noisier images than overly processed ones.Oh, one more thing: if you buy this, seriously consider picking up a third-party battery with at least 1500mah.

It is fast, it has high definition everything, it is easy to use, and it has a number of settings (in addition to \"automatic\") that makes it easy to get the best out of various picture-taking situations (including underwater). Optional accessories include an underwater housing (I have purchased one - it is amazing - useful in rainy or misty weather as well as underwater), telephoto and wide angle lenses (though the 6X built-in optical zoom will handle most telephto needs, the easy to mount 2X telephoto accessory doubles that to 12X optical zoom). The shoe on the top of the camera makes Canon flashes work seamlessly with the camera, though the built-in flash is fine for short distances. The camera is so sensitive that the flash is usually not needed, even in dim light. The optical anti-shake feature works exceptionally well. Some critics have pointed out that you can not save images in RAW format (a format that advanced professionals use to get non-compressed data in case they want to modify the images before they are compressed into usual formats), but with the options you have with this camera, it is unlikely that most users will ever need RAW and most would not use it if it were available. I have compared the features of the Canon G7 with the recently available Leica of about the same size and shape, though many times more expensive.

I simply wanted the best point and shoot we could find and I believe I found it. I used the aquarium setting to take pics from inside a vehicle and got no glare or reflection at all from the glass. I also actually shook the camera up and down just to see what would happen to a pic and it was very good, except when using a lot of zoom. I look forward to using this camera a lot and trying new things with it that I've never had in a camera before.", "Date": "December 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Super camera and it almost fits in your pocket!", "Author": "E.

This caused me to do many hours of on-line research before choosing this Canon. I happen to be fond of Leica and really wanted one. I'm also fond of my hard earned money and did not like the price of the Leica as much as the mystique that it represented, but the Leica/Panasonic D-Lux 3 seemed to be a real possibility. I looked at reviews and saw complaints of noise in both. I looked on Flickr's camera finder link and viewed images from both the Canon and Leica, as well as the Lumix and a 9mp Fuji. All produced superb images. Many showed signs of sharpening in post production. The Leica seemed to have the potential for slightly better quality under the most ideal of conditions, but noise was also slightly more evident.The fuji was a great performer but I prefer the traditional rangefinder style of the others. I purchased the Canon from Amazon and am very pleased with it. Though small it becomes comfortable in the hand after some use. The images are superb, the color spot on. The delay is a little long when photographing active children but it's not the size of an EOS.

We also have a Canon D30, a fantastic camera of course, but when we've taken the same pictures with both cameras using the Auto settings, we've consistently found the G7's to be better in all ways.  Sure, you can't attach the same lenses we use on the D30, and if you're a real photographer looking to tweak settings and do specialized shots, it's a whole different world.  But if you're taking a LOT of pictures, on a vacation or at an event, you can set this thing on Auto and most of the time you'll be really happy with the results.The flash is VERY bright (far superior to the built in D30 flash) so shooting in dark rooms is easy.  (We're looking at manually decreasing the brightness actually).  The one drawback we've found, which has previously been stated, is that Red Eye seems more common on the G7 than our D30 or even our very old Sony digital camera.  I am not sure why it's such as issue, but sadly that is a serious drawback when shooting a lot of people's faces at close range with a flash.  We've been shooting peformers slightly off center to avoid the problem.The battery life is a bit lacking, but the charging speed with the supplied charger is very quick which makes up for it as long as you have 2 batteries for the event/occassion.  I've found the battery will last about the same amount of time a 4 gig card lasts, (app. 300-350 shots).  We take that many or more a night and it's almost always with a flash on every shot, so daytime or well lit photos will likely result in more battery life.In the photos we compared side by side, I think most would find it difficult to tell which are the D30 and which are the G7 except for the dimensional size difference.Overall, this is the best little camera we've ever used.

I knew this when I bought it so I don't hold it against the camera.I like to travel and I wanted a camera that takes great pics.I also wanted the option of manual control but not necessarily a dslr.I wanted the option to print out bigger prints if I reallyliked how it turned out. Another important thing is the abilityto take really nice videos (which I never knew how important it was for me- for sentimental reasons). I also wanted to be able to throw itin my bag. This camera fits my needs perfectly.I am not a photographer, but I have taken photo classes and am familiarwith Slr's and some digital cameras. If you want a simple point and shoot,go with something cheaper (there are other Canon Powershot cameras that can do just that for less money). I don't think you should purchase this if you are not really going to take advantage of all the options the camera gives you. It does have Image Stabilization so you can take pics with less light and the pics don't come out as blurry (meaning you can hand hold the camera in lower or dimmer light). The camera does tend toblow out hightlights (so that some really bright areas of the picture loses detail)in really bright conditions. I counter that by under exposing the picture, and there's a button for that. Then I can always tweak the picture later on in Photoshop. On really sunny days, it's a good idea to turn the Neutral Density filter on. There's alot of ways to get around it..  You can also use the histogram to take a test shot and the blown out highlights will blink and then you can adjust stuff accordingly. There is a lens conversion adapter you can buy in addition to the camera for lenses and filters you may want to add. I don't think it truly needed 10MP but that's ok with me (though some people say it affects the amount of noise in the picture)...It's got face priority and so it automatically focuses on faces. You can add a flash- it has a hot-shoe. It has the Digic III Processor (faster processing speeds). I would not suggest shooting higher than ISO 400, since it gets noisier from there... It can shoot at ISO 3200 which yes, is noisy but I can shoot pictures of people dancing in dance clubs and bars, lighting and all without trails and blurriness... It's got all sorts of other shooting modes, which I use sometimes.. Like there are settings so you can shoot pics in flourescent lighting, or underwater. There are settings in scene mode so you can shoot fireworks, foliage, portraits, indoor, sports, landscapes etc..It zooms in nicely- 6x optical zoom.. I don't really care about digital zoom... Optical zoom is the one that counts..I have to say, I am really happy with this camera. If I would ever like to get more serious, I can borrow my husband's Canon 20D.. What says a lot, is that he bought an extra G7 in addition to mine as an everyday camera..For what it does, I think it's worth the price because it's in its own class. It's more than a simple point and shoot camera..P.S. I hope the info I give is helpful and accurate.. I really suck at the technical aspects of photography. Oh and read the manual, it helps a lot..P.P.S To see what this camera does, check out people's pics on flickr[..]Quite impressive!EDIT** The g9 is coming out soon with RAW, however, there is a hack now available to make the g7 shoot RAW (which with less megapixels, may actually yield a less noisier pic).

It won't be going in your shirt pocket. In fact it comes with a nice shoulder strap instead of a wrist-loop, and I tended to wear it on the strap, like the old SLR days.

Even photos taken from inside a car in motion will look still. The 6x optical zoom is fast and reliable. Too bad you can't use it when recording video.ISO 80, 100, 200 and 400: Amazing results; sharp details and clear, natural, rich colors for most light conditions. I'm a flash hater so I often use ISO 400 indoors.ISO 800 and 1600: Add some noise to the pictures, but in return you get higher speed shots for dim light scenes that otherwise would be impossible to get without flash or tripod. The resulting noise when using these ISO settings is not that bad compared to other cameras I've used before.The video recording feature works fine for not being a camcorder. Pretty fast exposure adjusting and convincing WB in its fair-enough 640x480 px.I bought it last year and I just can't stop taking pictures (I've shot more than 4000 with it by now). Even though I'm a perfectionist, most photos look so good they don't need any post editing at all.If I got my camera stolen or broken, I would buy it again.

How time flies. I wanted to point out that even in rough use, the G7 can take it and take more shots.  Here's the story...The wife borrowed the camera for a business trip and went to DC.  She was at dinner with some colleagues who offered to take a snapshot of her and some other friends at dinner.  The colleague whom she handed the camera must have been a little too confident because he dropped the camera on the granite floor, but not on the body...on the lens!  OUCH!  Well, the camera lens was 'tweaked' and would not recede in to the body when powered off.  Broke...They thought.  The wife comes back, and everyone is horrified because this camera was about 3 weeks old.  The friend was horrified and sent a check for $500 to replace the camera.  Nice guy...I can respect that he stood up and replaced it.  I got the new camera (a G9 from Fry's) the next week, and decided to \"experiment\" because who knows...  I very gently pushed the camera's lens to one side, and under general battery power, the camera retracted the lens.  How cool! Next, I attempted to see if the lens was broken in any way.  I shot bright, fast, dim, close, far...everything.  I cannot say that I have any perceptible difference in the shooting of this camera from when it wasn't dropped.  The lens doesn't even squeak any longer (when we got it, there was the faintest of squeaks when it opened the lens).  So, can I say this is a durable camera?  Certainly!Happy Shooting!---The Canon G7 is one of the best Point and Shoot cameras I have ever used, and besides looking great (very retro), it's images are outstanding!  I bought mine from some local electronics store because I am impatient and needed it right away for a business photography need, but could have saved some money by buying it from Amazon or elsewhere online.It's settings are astounding and I am just getting to the point of where I can use more versatility than just the standard program or auto functions.  I especially love shutter priority where it's 3 very sensitive CCDs \"push\" the images colors over the top!  When indoors and shooting stills, it's so good on these images that I don't need a flash many times (although it may require a few pratice shots to keep the body still when exposing for extended frames).  If you're new to the idea of video available on a point and shoot, this camera will also impress the user by being easy to use and easy to review your newly captured video footage.  It has 2 options: very-good and high-quality for the video footage (not the real setting names).It's a durable camera as well, but (being too embarassed) I won't describe how I found that out! :O  I will tell you that I am completely impressed and delighted that I spent the money I spent, after having tried SOOO many cameras that fall short in one area or another.If you're looking for a great camera, the G7 or the G9 will not disappoint.  Unless you're exploding images up to poster size routinely, this camera could be your best daily photography tool.  This  camera seems to do it all for me @ my level (I am a former SLR owner, who doesn't like taking the full kit with me just for snapshots).  My only regret was not waiting on the G9 because the screen size appears to be a little bigger, and it has a better set of sensors (it's 12MP).

Alexander", "ReviewID": "R2GXSX39RIGE1B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for all the reasons everyone says. Here are a few pros and cons I found important to me.PROSMovies: You can zoom while taking movies.Zoom: Zoom is responsive, which I was worried about because my previous camera had a zoom ring which I liked a lot.Colors: Vibrant, true colors. Even when the camera comes out a bit short on colors due to lighting conditions, the Canon software has an auto-adjust that is amazing (and easy to use).Playback button: There is a button which toggles between playback and record. Makes it very easy to review a shot and go back to record. Great feature.Flash: I've been so satisfied with the built-in flash, I have not bought an external flash even though there is a hotshoe on the camera.CONSISO dial: The ISO dial is very easy to accidentally turn as you remove the camera from a case or pocket. The result is you may be shooting at a high ISO and get grainy, ususable pictures. This has happened to me two or three times.Viewfinder: The viewfinder is not an electronic viewfinder (EVF), so what you see in the viewfinder gets you to point the camera higher than you really would want. Another disadvantage with a non-electronic viewfinder is that you can't review pictures in the viewfinder. You must use the LCD. With my less than perfect vision, viewfinder review is better (had it in a previous camera).Grip: There is no grip. Some people find the camera difficult to hold. I don't mind it, but I do prefer having a grip.Wide-Angle: 35mm is as low as you can go. 28mm would be nice, but maybe not possible with the higher zoom. Therefore, if taking pictures of a large group, say your kid on prom night, you have to step back. Almost bought an SD800 for this.Flash: I much prefer a pop-up flash where you can press a button and force the flash. On the G7, you can force the flash, but it is not as convenient.Fun-Factor: I do enjoy this camera, but sometimes wish I'd bought the S5, which wasn't out yet. It looks like it is more fun to use, based on my experience with a similar camera in the past and based on playing with the S3 in a store.", "Date": "September 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Just What I Needed!", "Author": "cyberpsycho \"cyberpsycho\"", "ReviewID": "R1WDUQ0VX6H6DB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The G7 is perfect for anyone who wants near SLR quality shots without packing an SLR and the assorted accessories.  The G7 is not an SLR replacement by any means, and probably wasn't intended as such, but I've yet to find a compact-size camera that comes this close.Indoors and low lighting performance is a bit noisy at high ISOs, but outdoors shots are excellent.  The LCD screen is clear and sharp, but I have issues with the viewfinder, which I feel is useless (no matter how I adjust the diopter, it's still blurry to my eye!). As a previous Canon owner (the S3 IS), I've found that the menus are fairly intuitive and easy to maneuver.  Battery life is very good. I've taken as many as 275 shots in one session and gone home with some juice leftover.I bought the G7 specifically for urban street shooting, and in combination with a Lowepro Rezo 50 Camera Bag belt pouch, this is exactly what I needed.

The difference that matters to me is that the G9 has raw format (and 12 megapixels), while G7 does not have raw format (and has 10 megapixels -which is of much lesser importance).If you care about raw, buy the new G9If you do not intend to use raw, G7 is just as good, the minor difference in pixels is nearly irrelevant, and G7 will be less expensive (if it continues to be available).G7 is an excellent camera but to take advantage of its numerous advcanced features you have to understand a bit about digital photography or better be an enthusiast. Especially the custom settings (C1 and C2) are v. useful.

There's this AWE involved which translates to no RAW, so what? No flip-screen, but this better? Great new CMOS called Digi-III, etc. etc. Here's what I think is the bottom-line here. (You may check my other reviews on Canon XTi/D30/D20, etc.)Question to ask yourself FIRST -> do you have a digital camera right now? Then think - do you really ever use any settings other than \"Auto\" ever? I asked and found 90% never did or plan to do. Then, since this camera is almost $500, for a point-and-shoot might as well look at alternatives. In case, you do use, or you never had a P&S; Digital before, then comes the question of RAW, Digic-III, etc. etc.Digic-III - it's more aggressive in terms of noise reduction, i.e. as you'll increase the ISO or @ low light you will find less noise compared to Digic-II. Additionally, there's the face recognition feature of Digic-III and more than 1 Gb. allowable storage. If you're to ask me, then for the last 2 options it definitely not worth the extra dough, period. Face recognition is good to have but it's also something hardly anyone will ever REALLY feel the need of, i.e. in case you buy a cheaper one with exactly the same features, will you really miss Face Recognition? Don't think so. Now comes the noise reduction (NR). Although it's better, but it comes at a price. The price is when you'll hair, sand, course materials, you will have fuzziness and furthermore there will be highlight/shadow clippings or chromatic (red-shifted) \"abberation\" more than Digic-II. What this means, that a photo which has \"heavy\" contrast, would have washed out portions or completely black sections and these sections upon zooming will 90% of the time have red colored fringes on them. Digic-III is NOT much of an improvement over Digic-II, only minute. Consider this factor before deciding if worth $500.Hot-shoe - Yes, great, etc. etc. But are seriously going to ever lug a flash and attach it to this camera and shoot photos? Or, will it be once on some \"rainy\" day, you'll be doing it?My take - this can be avoided and less costly one bought. Somehow, I think although this is GREAT, GREAT camera with TERRIFIC photos, the bells and whistles are NOT worth the additional almost $200.00 for it. There are others from Canon equally good.My take on photos taken:- Quality: Superb - color reproduction at par with consumer SLRs- Build: Best around, in terms of P&S; type of cameras- Weather-proof/water-proof/etc.:No- Stabilization: Optics driven (ALL Canon are)- Battery-life: As standard as other P&S;, nothing exceptional- Features: EXTENSIVE - from manual, histograms, ISO, hot-shoe, etc., etc. --> Very, very powerful camera- Lens specs: Excellent,better than most P&S;, including rest of CanonFinal take: If you use SLR, are more or less a prof., or serious amateur, you do need a small P&S; to tug along - this a good, damn good option to have. However, if you are about to go on a cruise with family and need a reliable, standard camera which will do the needful - this can be avoided and a more cheaper one bought.It's most powerful stuff are in it's feature set, manual controls and overrides, lens specs and powerful noise suppression algo.", "Date": "July 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "\"Lens error, restart camera\"", "Author": "SunDarth \"ScooterTrash\"", "ReviewID": "R1WDSNOCI40CVA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this camera in Jan 2007, and last week received the infamous and well documented message, \"lens error, restart camera\".", "Date": "February 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "canon G 7", "Author": "Frankie Jimenez", "ReviewID": "R1PTP6MZKK0A1W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera, however it was damage.

Most don't want to carry a DSLR on the trail or globe trotting so size does matter. There are many things a photographer can do to make a beautiful photo but, as many here would like to suggest otherwise, nature does not always provide perfect lighting. Imagine your in Madagascar and want to take a photo of that beautiful lemur. You take the best shot you can, great composition and focus but the lighting is a little dim at that moment. Do you toss that photo and hope to return to Madagascar again someday? No, you set your camera for reasonable shutter speed to avoid a blurry photo and know you can fix the exposure back home. Why someone one would need a G7 for popping shots of their friends at parties or of their grandchildren is beyond me. And sure, if you're a pro and can control your lighting there may very well be no need for you to use RAW format (except of course color correction) but for those of us who want a portable camera with manual controls and take photos in natural unrehearsed setting with uncontrolled light RAW format is essential and unfortunately the G7 falls short.", "Date": "January 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA---IT HAS NO WIDE ANGLE LENS", "Author": "John Boland \"John  Boland\"", "ReviewID": "R22SWXFK0JA2VV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a good camera as far as it goes.

Even though I don't care much for RAW format (rarely use it anyway), but it's a factor that separate the higher-end cameras from the lower-end one. The fact that it doesn't have RAW, it shows that Canon did not put anytime in designing this camera. Nowadays, I feel like camera manufactures take advangtage of the Image Stablization (or anti-shake) system. In my opinion, I don't think it really works. I mean, a blurry shot will be blurry regardless if the IS system is there or not. Camera manufactures just use Image Stablization as a way of marketing and try to make more money off of the camera they are selling. Also, I need to mention about the noise level of this camera. It's terrible!!! There were lots of noise in the picture even at ISO 100!!! I think this is due to the fact that Canon is trying to fit 10 MP into a 1/1.8\" image sensor. This is no good. This camera would have been better off at 6-8 MP instead of 10 MP.  Anyway, enough bad things about this camera. The Canon G7 does offer a very nicely built camera. It feels very solid in the hand. There are many manual controls in the camera for the user to do creative things like taking long-shots at night. The LCD screen is very nice with high resolution. An external hot-shoe flash terminal is a plus. It is compatible with all Canon's flashes. The color being reproduced by this camera is very vibrant and accurate (like a Canon cameras). Very fast responding time due to the Digic III image processor. Overall, I think that anyone spending this much money for this camera, they might as well get a DSLR instead.

But even though i gave this a high rank, you really will get the truth.I have just recieved this camera only a few days ago but the more time i spend with it, the more i love it. This camera is specilized for close up ranges and can blow up the pictures from 16.5 to 22 inches. I love this camera and even though it in RAW format, its just as good. I love the shake resistance and the LCD monitor is just wonderful. I co-own a photogrpahy company and need to take pictures of weddings and special occasions so this camera is a great improvement from the old one. These pictures produce beautiful pictures and oh yeah, if anyone has questions or comments or needs a photographer, Our company is J&A; photogprahy and can email us at japhotgraphy1@yahoo.com", "Date": "July 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera", "Author": "David G.

I've been offered one job doing photography, and am the one person who's private photos of a festival have been specially invited to be submitted for future promo pieces. Not even counting the many folks who want copies of my pics, 8x10 blowups, or say that should be a postcard, etc. etc.Even with a broken viewer button on my camera, I've been so impressed by my G2 photo quality that I'm loathe to \"upgrade\"... and if I do, I'm sticking with the Canon G series.So, if you're an average photog, who likes to have people rave over your photos -- don't go anywhere else, stay with the canon G series. (uh, and remember to learn how to focus on a digital camera, or use the flower button for closeups... that's it, all else is done for you).Or, if like me, you want good quality photos of yr kids to keep forever, again, buy this.", "Date": "March 9, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "10-megapixel CCD captures enough detail for photo-quality 18 x 24-inch prints\n6x image-stabilized optical zoom; 2.5-inch vari-angle LCD with wide viewing angle\n9-point AiAF, single point AF, Flexizone AF, and Face-priority AF\nContinuous shooting in other modes besides Sports\nStores images on SD memory cards; powered by Canon NB-2LH or NB-2L Lithium-Ion batteries.
