{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Simply superb", "Author": "Scorpius", "ReviewID": "R3F57KDRD263BT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the pleasure of shooting with a Leica S for a few months and feel compelled to write a few words to mitigate the spoof one star review already posted.First off is ergonomic's,the S/S2 feels like a slightly chunkier 5Dmk3,it is simple in design and very functional with five customisable  button's,the S has GPS tagging (the S2 doesn't),the body is also weatherproofed which is very useful,this camera is tough enough(this is a big advantage over Phase or Hasselblad for sone people) to be used in all conditions.The viewfinder has 98% coverage (the S2 was 94% I think.) and is a pleasure to use,far better than nikon or canon,it's huge and bright.The Battery is extremely good and good for up over a thousand shot's,it's lithium and 2100mAh.it is also easy to change.The rear LCD on the S is a big improvement over the S2,very sharp and great colour ,it is made from corning gorilla glass and is as tough as you expect,I used an anti reflective coating to make it easier to see outdoor's.The A.F is faster and more accurate on the S than S2 but still not great in low light and not as fast as nikon,but that's typical of the format.Another great feature is the ability to flash sync at 1/1000th second,great for controlling ambient light or freezing action with flash,but this feature only work's if you have CS version's of the lenses,if you try to engage CS mode with a non CS lens attached it will simply remain in focal plane shutter mode which limit's flash sync to 1/125th sec.Tethering is via proprietary software called image shuttle,it's not bad but not as good as Capture one pro, Phocus or even Lightroom but it's functional and you can set up hot folders in lightroom anyway and preview the images there,the tether cable is USB2,a little disappointing but still fast enough,the cameras only shoots and about 1.5FPS anyway.(Still I want to see USB 3 in the next model,and maybe CMOS too with live view)The sensor is a kodak CCD which measure's 45mm x30mm,a similar size to a H5d 40,not as large as the H4d-60/IQ260 sensor's which measure 40.4x54.7 but still considerably larger than 35mm F.F (36mm x 24mm),it's the same size as the S2 sensor but with a lower base ISO (100 vs 160).At iso100 the file's are beautiful with gorgeous tonality and great colour(makes stunning B&W; conversions too),there are 12 stops of D.R and lots of room for manipulation in Lightroom (Lightroom is the best raw converter for the S,Capture One pro is quite good,extracting more detail but I feel color is better in Lightroom,make sure to use the embedded profile),higher ISO's don't work well,this is a camera which is best used at base ISO,I wouldn't go past 400 myself..Another point is that the sensor is full 16bit like the phase and Hasselblad,not 14bit like the Canon and Nikon's,some people say this is irrelevant but to my eyes 16bit files have better color graduation,although you will find it hard to see a difference looking at online jpegs,you need access to the RAW's to make an accurate assessment,the native file format is a DNG which is useful and allows you to use custom DNG profile's generated with Color checker passport  in Lightroom.X-Rite MSCCPP ColorChecker PassportAnother point I would like to highlight is the aspect ratio is classic Leica ratio of 3:2,Phase and Hasselblad aspect ratio's are 4;3,People will have their own preferences here,I like both.A useful feature of the S which is also an advantage over Hasselblad and Phase is the dual memory cards (one is C.F and the other S.D) which can be set to sequential or parallel storage,parallel is very useful for backup in the field.The real reason to buy into this system is the glass,the lenses are amazing,sharp as razors but with very little distortion,almost no aberration's,beautiful Bokeh,lovely contrast and colour and excellent wide open performance,the resolution of the lenses is very high with loads of micro contrast,they are the best lenses made today and are limited by diffraction only,(Rodenstock HR are awesome but very different)if you shoot with strobes a lot then buy the C.S version's.The S lenses also have great manual focus ability for those who like to manual focus,which is better for landscape etc,if you do like to use manual consider the split prism focus screen Leica S-Camera Microprism Screen 16001 ,it makes a difference....Another benefit of the S is the ability  to use glass from other system's via adaptor's,if you own Mamiya,Hasselblad H or V,Pentax or Contax lenses you can use them on this camera with full A.F and aperture controlLeica 16030 S-Adapter Interchangeable Lens and Leica S-Adapter For Contax (16038)Leica M645 S-Adapter for Mamiya 645-System Lenses and Leica 16026 P67 S-Adapter for Pentax 67 Lenses This versatility is a great bonus.If you buy one of these and know how to use it you won't be disappointed ,sure it's expensive but still half the price of an IQ180 or H5D-60,and you will get access to lenses that are simply outstanding ,and a Medium format body that feels like a canon 5D in your hands", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Auto Focus Doesn't Work", "Author": "Hilow \"Bill\"", "ReviewID": "R65QMA4J3J86D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Blurry images in low light.
