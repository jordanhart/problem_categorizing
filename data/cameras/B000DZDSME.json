{"Reviews": [{"Title": "At last, a manufacturer gets it right!", "Author": "Prasad Upasani", "ReviewID": "R2PUHYP15VOI73", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been waiting forever for a digital camera with decent quality that allowed optical zoom when capturing video so I didn't need to carry a separate video camera. Finally Casio delivers with this model that lets you silently zoom upto 7x (wow!) when using the camera. Previous models disabled optical zoom during video capture to prevent the lens mechanism noise from being captured, but this one is almost silent. To give some context I have been using Casio's EX-Z750, and I can say this is a much better camera, especially in terms of video capture.Pros:- 7x optical zoom. Note this lens is completely internal so nothing protrudes out. Not sure how Casio managed to do this but kudos to them.- Use of the full 7x optical zoom during video capture.- The new H.264 video encoding codec produces extremely good video compared to older models. Previous models tended to produce more grainy video, especially in low light. Also includes stereo audio recording!- Fairly small size. Not quite as small as the Optio but still very small. Anything smaller is really too small to hold comfortably for me.- Retains ability to use manual aperture and other controls including histograms- Very good best-shot modes including new high-sensitivity modes for low light situations.- The flash can be kept continuously on for use as a video light.- Support for the new SDHC cards, the bigger capacities are certainly useful for capturing video.- New optional widescreen modes for video- First Casio model to incorporate mechanical image stabilization in addition to digital for both stills and video.- As opposed to older Casio models, allows imprinting date and time on photos.- Allows users to customize use of buttons- Whole bunch of other features too numerous to mention. Take a look at their website. Casio is an old name in the electronics business and knows how to make user-friendly gadgets.Ok, now for some things NOT done right:- My biggest complaint is that the only way to charge battery is through the docking station. This means you need to carry a docking station with you when travelling. Previous models had after-market external battery chargers you could buy, but I haven't seen one for this model yet. And no, old chargers don't work since this is a different battery form factor.- The docking station is also the only way to connect the camera to a PC, though I got around this by using the SD card reader on my PC.- On the subject of batteries, this one has about half the life as compared to the EX-Z750, 850 or 1000 models. Given the docking station requirement to charge, you will need to buy a spare battery eventually.- The image stabilization mechanism is a little noisy. Scared me the first time till I found out that was normal.- The autofocus mechanism tends to \"hunt\" a bit especially zoomed in.Overall, many more positives than negatives. Definitely recommend this camera. Note its also available in black, though not everywhere.", "Date": "April 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not quite up to my expectations", "Author": "Christopher S. Powers \"Xrosein3\"", "ReviewID": "R2V5STIZIXQRYN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this camera last night.  I was thrilled to finally get my hands on this because I absolutely loved my Casio Z750.  I've been using a Fuji Finepix F30 in the interrim time since my Casio kicked the bucket.  Now that I have both cameras side by side, I must say that the F30 image quality is so much better that it makes me sad that I just spent a bundle on this Casio product.  The EX-V7 is better in some respects.  I will compare the two cameras a bit, since I currently have both.Zooming while taking video on the EX-V7 is great and it even has a variable speed zoom, but the camera can't hold a decent focus whether I'm zooming or not.  The image is so washed out without the sharpness turned up a couple of notches, it appears blurry.  Filming in widescreen format is fun, too, but  even though it is filming in HQ I don't notice great image quality. The images from an indoor scene are grainy and not even old-school camcorder quality. In fact, when I play the HQ video on my computer monitor I consistently get distortion lines flickering across the image anytime there is camera or subject movement.  This might have something to do with the compatibility of my system with the camera, but it is unpleasant nevertheless, and may happen to other people.The color tones on skin, and the indoor range of the flash are very poor in comparison to the F30.The location of the lense is a bit problematic as my left hand typically uses that space on the camera for stabilization.Start up and cycle time on this Casio is as wonderful as on my z750.Image playback, magnification and moving, and file deletion on the EX-V7 is amazingly speedy in comparison to the F30.The autofocus works much more consistently on the EX-V7.  The F30 gets the focus wrong on occasion and the EX-V7 is nailing it pretty consistently so far. I have notice, however, that once I magnify my Casio images, they seem to lose a bit of detail.  This could be related to the image stabilization.One of the biggest things I miss in the EX-V7 is the EX button.  For every tweak you want to make to the adjustments, you have to cycle through the menu.  Granted, Casio has one of the best and most intuitive menu systems out there, but it is not cool to have to scroll through many options just to find your white balance or your EV shift.  Casio definitely blew it on this one.  It is a big downgrade.It is also sad that there is no macro button to quickly select.  This must be done through the focus selection menu.This camera still has a great set of selections to choose from and is still very speedy, but it doesn't measure up to the Casio Z750 in video quality or ease of use.  The video and image quality of the Fuji FinePix F30 is markedly better in an indoor setting and slightly better in an outdoor setting.  It is a little easier to see that the video is of higher quality on the EX-V7 when video is taken in bright outdoor light, but I still can't stand the horizontal lines across my screen throughout the movie.Overall, I'm more pleased with my F30 because the image and video quality is more pleasing to the eyes.  The V7 is a good product and doesn't ruin the Casio name.  If I didn't have a camera to compare side-by-side, I wouldn't have known as much about what I did not like in the image quality.  If you already have this camera, enjoy it's many features once you get used to working your way through the menu system.  If you haven't purchased it yet, weigh the options and figure out if you want a camera that will take better pictures indoors and in low light.  If so, I would recommend the F30.", "Date": "April 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "10 days with EX-V7", "Author": "Scott B. Vetter \"Scott\"", "ReviewID": "R5GVGH8S7GVWH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I agree with the points of the other reviewers.  Note the manual mentions to store the battery in the drained state for extended periods. I plan to order a second battery, but will probably have it charged all the time. An extra docking station will make things easier while on holiday.  There is also a mention to edit or delete photos through the photo software not while connected to a PC.  I used to \"cut\" the photos from my old camera using Windows, but for this one it looks like I'll just format the media in the camera to erase them once they are \"copied\" to the PC hard disk. The dock station does make it easy to charge, view, and access the media, so no need to get an SDHC reader for new 4 and 8 GB SD cards.  The camera is a little heavy for a pants pocket with the battery.  Heading to Disney in a week, so looking forward to some real-world results.After a few days in Disney, this camera is growing on me.  I can see the need to pre-focus (wait for green) on this camera compared to my last because the default depth of field is more narrow.  Pressing the button down all at once will (according to the manual), focus to infinity and not give great results in some cases.  Battery life has been very good.  Will comment more then I upload the photos and movies.I'm back from Disney, and I have uploaded my pix.  I took pictures on a 4 GB SD card and at the 7 megapixel and 2 megapixel modes using the best picture quality setting.  I also took a few movies at the medium movie quality.  I'm not a professional (at all), and had the camera in full auto mode the whole time (no time to stop the action for a manual camera setting! And who would listen to me?). The only thing I did was turn on and off the flash to suit the setting and use the built-in 2 second timer to rest the camera for some night shots.  I kept image-stablization set to the hardware-setting, not the one that includes both hardware and software. I read that somewhere.I took some pictures of the thunder mountain ride - standing on the sidelines, and of the tea cups thing, and of a foutain at night, and then some.I'm not someone to tweak pictures after I upload them.  This camera produced some great shots after pressing the button that were razor sharp and full of color (think Gold film if you remember) when looking at them on Windows XP default picture viewer thing zoomed to 400%.  I have to stress again the need to pre-focus - required.  Wearing the camera in the front pocket of my jeans did cause the twirl-dial to change settings, so once I took a movie instead of a picture (Humpff). I recommend checking the setting when taking the camera out (I don't use a case, will probably never buy one, I'm point and shoot).  I took a movie of the Disney band on mainstreet and the sound quality and stereo was great - and the picture spot on (Quicktime 7 required for playback).  On a roller coaster (I filmed the entire ride - while remaining quiet!), the wind noise was terrible, but I was going 60 mph.  The coaster was at night and the camera did better than some of those \"Cops\" videos we see from professional camera feeds.This camera promises a lot with its price-point and manual settings, but I would absolutely not expect to get SLR (do people still own these?) quality with 7x zoom out of the front pocket of my jeans (at least for now - technology marches on).  What I did get was a point-and-shoot camera (that has many manual settings) that does two amazing things in one package (albeit slightly weighty), zoom-point-shoot and take great (leading edge) videos. Ideal vacation campanion, and therefore part of my travel kit. I would think there are less expensive cameras for point and shoot people (with less zoom or more pixels), and other $400+ cameras for the professionals.

This camera is even worse than the most critical review I have read. If I could I would return it, but it's too late. I'm stuck with a camera that takes poor photos. And this wasn't a cheap camera.Here are the problems with it:-Anti-shake reduction works very poorly (compared to Sony T-series). Even moderate, normal hand shaking resulted in blurred photos despite the anti-shake reduction mode.-Colors are TERRIBLE. They are too dark on auto settings, but when I increase the EV, the colors are poor/washed out. Again, I have been taking photos side-by-side with a Sony T-10, and the color difference is amazing (poor on the Casio).-Menu navigation is TERRIBLE. It can take a long time to change basic things such as ISO, Macro, timer, etc. Basically the auto mode only lets you adjust the flash mode (which is at least user-friendly).-The manual modes are ok, but hardly intuitive to even a relatively experienced user (used to the auto settings in any case).-Annoying camera cradle. The camera docking station/voltage converter is the size of two or three rechargers. And it really doesn't offer any real advantages.Pros (not that many):-7 power zoom works great.... but how necessary is it?-SD card. A stupid point, but one of my complaints about the generally excellent Sony cameras is their memory sticks (when I have only SD's).-Nice, white light that can be used for indoor shoots and the camera.-Great size, especially considering the 7X zoom.In sum, despite some nice features and possibilities, the poor photo quality makes this camera a terrible buy.

He has shown some interest in doing simple video projects.  It was also time to upgrade him from my very old 2MB Kodak hand me down camera.  I wanted an inexpensive camera/camcorder that would be simple to use.  It was particularly important that it be easy to import the videos and photos into his laptop.  I did not want my son to have to deal with the complexity of DVD or DV tape solutions.  The EX-V7 generally meets these criteria.I am rather disappointed in the low build quality of the camera.  It is made of cheap plastic that looks like it will break rather easily.  The access door to the battery and SD card is so poorly constructed that I will instruct my son to not open it unless absolutely necessary.  He will have to transfer his images via the docking station's USB connector.  The plastic sliding door which uncovers the lens and activates the camera also seems very flimsy.Still photos are surprisingly good.  Not Canon good, but certainly more than passable and much better than that with a Sanyo Xacti C6.  Video, on the other hand, has a rather washed out look and is not a good as with the Sanyo.  It is much worse than the Sanyo HD1 / HD2.  What is particularly disappointing is the compression ratios produced by Casio's implementation of H.264 are much worse than the supposedly inferior non-H.264 compression  provided by Sanyo's cameras.  The highest quality video setting on the EX-V7 produces images that are much smaller and much less sharp than the Sanyo HD1 / HD2 but consumes about the same amount of memory.  Low light video performance is much worse than that of the HD1 and is no where close to that of the HD2.This may be OK for a 13 year old, but I would never consider buying one for myself.", "Date": "August 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good pictures, Lousy video - most likely a defect", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"The Mojo\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y33P7X4RM3SN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Having owned other Casio cameras in the past, and having been happy with all of them, I jumped on this camera.

When Casio comes out with a newer version of a camera with image stabilization, I would give them another shot. At this point, I can only conclude from my experience that they've not perfected their implmentation, or they just have quality control issues with their manufacturing process.

I had the previous version of this Exilim and loved it. This is the newer version with extra features and smaller with slightly smaller screen (so what). But a large screen is easier to break when you think about \"man-handling\" the camera.OK, let's see I tried it and love it. I like the new 7x zoom. Let's face it, those 3x zooms on digital cameras are virtually useless anyhow. This has a real zoom that the lens does not pop out; which is great. It can zoom while you're shooting videos. The videos are great and I like the new wide screen mode for you HDTV format screens. I like the wide screen mode for any TV because it is better resolution.I like the new anti-shake mode too.It's easy to learn. Some people don't like having to use the cradle the camera sits in when you upload pictures; but listen, it's charging the batteries  while it's uploading at the same time- no need to pull out a charger and plug it in to another outlet. It also has a nice little button on that cradle; plug in the video cable to a TV and it plays back with fades and, get this with music for a quick TV show before you upload the pictures and videos on your computer and edit your movie later with video editing software like Adobe Premier or the baby free \"Lead\" video editing software included.OK how about video editing. OK with the new wide screen video mode at the higher resolution  (.MOV Quick Time file) it will eat up more memory on you chip than using the LP mode. With the regular LP mode it makes a .AVI video file. That's good for using your Premier Elements 2.0 family version video editing software for faster imports. Now if you shoot in the wide screen mode it then makes a .MOV video file which means your Premier Elements 2.0 family version video editing software software will take a longer time to import the MOV file in. That's OK, be patient. It's worth the time for a great higher resolution video with wide screen. So cool. Will fit nice if you have a wide screen HDTV.Here is a tip about shooting and importing the .mov video files. If you decide to shoot in wide screen higher resolution mode (fine), then bring the video files one at a time. Yes bring only one .mov video file into your video editing software (at a time) and let it take more time to bring it it. Then render it save your project (in the video editing software) and then bring in another.MOV video file.You can bring in several video files if you shoot your  video in LP Mode, because it makes a slight lower, but acceptable, resolution .AVI video file.But this camera and you will love it.", "Date": "July 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Quite a lot in a small package", "Author": "The Z \"The Z\"", "ReviewID": "R3JX72UNVOT3P0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera does quite a lot in a small package.  7 megapixel, and movie capability along with a 7X optical zoom.

I could not take pictures, even though I was still able to view and delete the photos already on the camera.  I could also change settings, etc., but I could not take pictures.  I immediately went on to the Casio support website and it said that if you get this error message you need to mail the camera into to a repair facility.  So I called Casio tech support and they told me the same thing.  But they could not tell me how much it would cost and they also said I would be responsible for the shipping costs both ways.  I am assuming they have seen this error before and I believe they should have been able to provide at least an estimate over the phone.  But regardless of the poor tech support from Casio, I feel that knocking the camera onto its side should never cause a fatal error like this!!!  I did not drop the camera, I only knocked it on its side!  What the @$#% !!  I am seriously questioning the quality of this camera.
