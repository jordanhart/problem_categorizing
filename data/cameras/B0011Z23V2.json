{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It Was (Nearly) Everything I Needed", "Author": "J. Caruso", "ReviewID": "RHYI0FMWI69DW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to start off by saying I am a loyal Canon shooter. I own both film and digital SLRs and love them very much. When I needed a digital point and shoot to carry with me whenever carrying the DSLR was impractical, I saved my pennies and bought a G9. The G9 is a fantastic point and shoot which I highly recommend.So why am I writing a review for the Panasonic DMC-LZ10? Well, about a week ago, I dropped my G9 and the lens was stuck in the open position. I have to send it in to Canon for repair. In the interim, however, I didn't want to be without a digital point and shoot. I also didn't want to spend a boat-load of money. My first instinct was to get another Canon. I tried several of the lower-cost versions, in particular the A590Is. It's a fine camera, and I liked the IQ enough (but not as much as my G9). I didn't like the feel of it in my hand or the fact that it felt a bit flimsy. So I began to look around...and at other brands.During my research, the Lumix line kept popping up. I became curious. I did more, specific research. I then found that the LZ10 fulfilled nearly all of my needs/wants:1) Cost--I wasn't going to spend and arm and a leg on a camera that would be used pretty much while another was in the shop.2) Size--I wanted a camera small enough to take alone without being intrusive.3) IQ--I wanted a camera that was able to create photographs with good, usable image quality. I wanted low noise and good resolution. I wasn't going to fool myself into thinking I'd get DSLR quality, but I also didn't want to fool around with \"project\" photos.4) Control Beyond Pre-Set \"Scenes\"--I am very fond of being able to shoot in shutter priority, aperture priority, and manual. I will occasionally use Program mode, but often eschew the \"Scene\" or \"Creative\" modes.5) Build Quality--I like to USE my cameras, and I tote them along with me every day. Build quality is an important issue.6) File Format--In a perfect world I would love to have RAW capability.7) Battery--The propitiatory batter in my G9 wasn't as much of an issue because it uses the same batteries found in my older DSLR...batteries I already had but haven't been using. I wasn't interested in starting a whole new battery collection, so standard AAs were very appealing.8) Looks--Yes, a little bit of vanity creeps in now and again.So, how does the DMC-LZ10 stack up? Pretty darned favorably I have to say.1) Cost--It was right in my wheelhouse. I feel it is a good value for the money.2) Size--The camera is surprisingly small without feeling teeny. The ergonomics are good...it feels \"right\" in the hand.3) IQ--For a camera in this price range, I am very pleased with the image quality. The anti-shake works well, and my over-all hit-to-miss ratio is very favorable. The Leica lens is a good performer (although the photos will never be mistaken for those taken with an M8) and the wide angle end is very serviceable at 30mm (equivalent).4) Control Beyond Pre-Set \"Scenes\"--Yup...it has shutter priority, aperture priority, manual, and program modes. Sure, it also has all the \"Creative\" and \"Scene\" modes, as well as Panasoinc's \"Intelligent Automatic\" which really does a lot of thinking for you.5) Build Quality--Unlike the Canon A590Is, The DMC-LZ10 has a predominantly metal body and feels substantial.6) File Format--Here is where the camera lets me down a bit. There is no RAW support, only JPG.7) Battery--Double A batteries it is. I got some Eneloops and they work wonderfully.8) Looks--I have to admit this camera does LOOK good. It's sleek, with a hint of a retro feel that I really like.So in the end, I am very happy with my choice to get the Lumix DMC-LZ10. So happy, in fact, that I do not plan on shelving it once my G9 returns from the shop. I want to find some way to put it to use in my daily work flow.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Panasonic LZ10K", "Author": "D.

Fits into any pocket or the palm of your hand. It comes with all the bells and whistles you need to take a variety of different lighting condition photographs. I chose this camera over some of the other Panasonic cameras because it allows for a manual setting for aperture and shutter speeds. Additionally it allows for timed exposure shots. So I would suggest this camera for someone a tad bit advanced in the knowledge of photography. The zoom is good and the image stabilization works fine. Over all I would give this camera an 8 out of 10.  I took off 1 point because Panasonic could have fit a 3 inch viewing screen on the back rather than a 2 \u00bd inch and another point off for battery consumption.

Nevertheless, one feature that it does not have and I wish I had paid attention to before purchasing it is that it only has a digital viewfinder (not the traditional little window through which you aim at your target). In my outdoors trips on sunny days this was a major drawback. The surface of the digital viewfinder is very reflective and thus, rather than clearly seeing the target I see my own face. Additionaly, because you cannot turn the digital viewfinder off, it consumes more battery power than other digital cameras I had in the past. Otherwise, I would have given it five stars.", "Date": "November 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Exceptional features for this price!!!", "Author": "Rohit Chauhan", "ReviewID": "R2PTXP2MIDZ4N0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I waited for 5 days, and got a 10 megapixel, 5x optical zoom and a 30mm wide angle optically stabilized leica lens. All this along with P, A, S, M modes which are hard to find in such point and shooot cameras. Well on paper it seems great and actually unbeatable at the price at which it is offered. So, I wont take long and will come to the point.The cons:-> Slight shutter lag and screen blackout after a photograph (annoying).-> Takes a bit longer to focus while not in quick focus mode.-> Use of AA batteries (it can be of an advantage to few but for me its not much).-> Grip (there should have been a rubber or something instead of hard grey plastic in it).-> If I get too complaining, I'd say the wrist strap is placed on a wrong place, it should have been somewhere on the lower right side of the camera (but again it maybe just me who doesnt likes that).Now the pros:-> Good image quality with assistance of optical stabilization.-> Nice and easy to use with an intutive intelligent auto mode.-> Good control with A, S, M modes for more knowledgable photographers (im kinda working on it).-> 30mm wide angle is really handy in tight locations.-> Nice flash range with good focussing even in low light situations.-> Good widescreen videos (if you don't compare them to a camcorder).Overall, if you want a \"has it all\" kind of a camera which can do almost anything with a minimal budget.

Beck", "ReviewID": "R1PZ1YKUZ0LXVP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this camera to replace our older Fuji FinePix550 which has seen better days.  We immediately noticed that the Panasonic took longer to start up, focus, and shoot.  In fact, it was very difficult for us to take candid shots because the delay between flash-shutter-display was a good 2 to 3 seconds.  My wife has commented that she prefers the older Fuji, and I tend to agree.As far as quality of the images, it seems indor shots taken with a flash come out with an orange hue.  However, the features on this camera (including the OIS) seem to allow for crisper pictures overall.  If it wasn't for the long delay between snaping pics, we probably could live with the other minor short comings.On the positive side, this cammera took really nice motion pictures in both 16x9 and 4x3 aspect ratios, but they were in MOV format which requires the instalation of QuickTime on your PC (as opposed to AVI which can be handled by WMP).  And the multiple picure aspect ratios were also appreciated.Overall, this camera is being returned, and my search for the Fuji continues!", "Date": "January 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Less than impressed", "Author": "F. Morgan", "ReviewID": "R38WH9TYY320XF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is great for snapshots.  Its megapixel size of 10mb was dissapointing, as pictures appear to be out of focused when you \"zoom\" in on a picture taken with it.  Its 5x optical zoom is a nice feature. The user interface is fairly good, but not completely intuitive (as sometimes you have to refer back to the manual to figure out how to do some functions that you seldom use).  The face detection is neat, in the sense that it does seem to pick out the faces in the picture, however does it seem to make a differance in doing so?  I'm not so sure.  This is a case of value for your money...don't buy this for the megapixels, or the lens, or the stabilized zoom individually...buy this because it's a good compromise on all three areas for a reasonable price.  The build quality of the camera is good.  The bumpout on the left side (as you face the camera) provides a good hand hold - yet the camera easily fits in your shirt pocket.  Some of the other cameras, are so small, that its becomes an issue in easily holding the camera to take a picture.

It didn't take long to see the Panasonic LZ (long zoom) series keep getting mentioned and after some quick research I could see why.Like the Canons, this series accepts AA batteries, has manual focus, a sturdy body and image stabilization  - pretty standard features for even budget cameras today. However the LZ series adds a 5X optical zoom (best in class), auto bracketing (takes pictures slightly differing exposure levels to ensure a quality shot) and a wider range of video controls than its competitors. I had settled on an LZ8 at Amazon but picked up an LZ10 for the same price from Dell.After a few days of playing with the camera I feel extremely satisfied with my choice. The test shots I've taken have mostly been indoors or just outside the house in the evening. The images have consistently been well exposed and the live preview histogram a bonus. I find the Auto Mode adequate for everyday surroundings and love the fact that the preset \"SCENE\" modes also have an advanced feature settings for further customization - a nice touch. The 2.5 inch LCD (with variable brightness) makes framing a snap. You can capture images in widescreen format allowing for easy displaying on your HDTV. Panasonic's Quick Menu system is intuitive and makes changing settings a breeze. Sadly, there is no optical viewfinder.For around a $100 the LZ8/LZ10 seem hard to beat at this time.", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wonderful little camera", "Author": "B. H.

The camera handles like a high end 35mm compact, and has a limited but substantial range of options. I was not that impressed with the \"Intelligent\" point-and-shoot function on the camera. I often use it on manual. Go with the 100 ISO setting and the pictures come out beautifully. Otherwise, pixel-level quality tends to be quite low. Then again, low-light shooting is a problem with practically every digital compact.The dials on the camera are pretty nice; this way, you don't have to scroll through menus for the settings that have to be tweaked on the go for the specific picture you are taking. It also saves your settings for each mode, which is incredibly useful. You don't lose your optimized arrangement on the manual when you switch to, say, extended exposure at night.

Meadors \"J Meadors\"", "ReviewID": "R36DAP9P6Z9UTW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera specifically because it had a wider angle lens than most other point and shoots out there in the same price range.  As someone who shoots mostly indoor pics in tight spaces (a shoot a lot of apartment interiors), I need the widest possible lens I can get.  And in that regard, this camera works very well.I've had the camera for about a year now and I have it on me pretty much every single day.  I take a lot of pics--sometimes 50 a day--and this camera has never even given me so much as a hiccup.My only complaint about this camera--and it can be said of MOST cameras in this price range--is that it does not take very good pics in low light situations w/o a flash.  And I'm not talking about night time or anything... early evening outside or even day time inside in a room without much natural light.  Again this is a common problem but I HAVE seen / used other cameras that did not have this problem--namely the Canon digital Elphs and Powershots (not all but the mid-to-higher end ones).  Again, the main reason I bought this camera over those was price and the wide-angle lens.  So, to get something I needed I had to give up something I guess.With just a tiny bit of photo editing (mainly contrast and color balancing), 90% of the images you get from this camera will give you what you need (so long as they are not low light pics w/o a flash).  The wide angle takes good panoramic shots-though not at a very high resolution.Oh!  One more reason I bought this camera over other similar cameras was the AA batteries over a proprietary battery.  For some reason I have always preferred the former since batteries are cheap and plentiful.  I just rotate through two pairs of rechargeable AAs and I get plenty of working time from those.  Overall I give this camera a 4 out of 5 for what it is.  I knock of 1 star for the poor low light images and overall slightly lower quality images than I have achieved with other similar cameras.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "easy to use and takes quality photos", "Author": "Dee Z", "ReviewID": "R1LBEYXJGIMRBJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this was purchased for my college daughter and she loves it!

H Mark", "ReviewID": "R1QN7H1MCEXQZJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The price on this camera has been fluctuating a lot.  when it is less than $110 it is hard to beat for the combination of features.  Probably not a good deal for greater than $150.I agree with many positive reviews, just want to highlight some pertinent negatives for some users.Lens is relatively slow (3.3- 5.9), so in low light the ISO will be bumped up a lot, producing grainier pictures.  However, there is an extremely nice \"auto ISO\" mode, where you can select the maxiumum ISO you want the camera to automatically select.Like many AA battery cameras, it is slow to recharge flash, thus do not expect to shoot rapid fire flash shots.  According to other reviews, battery life is great, though.It is not particularly fast between shots.There is an odd \"backlight\" reminder that shows up on the screen all the time, reminding you to push one of the buttons if you have a backlight situation.  Seems like kind of an afterthought, after they decided they could not automate a backlight exposure situation (some cameras do this when the focussed object is darker than the rest of the image).No viewfinder, but this is a rarely missed feature (but I need sometimes).At a good price, this is an awesome camera with excellent choice of zoom range (130-150), excellent quality photos, good construction.  All around fantastic camera with perfect choice of features for a cheap compact.", "Date": "January 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent, versatile camera for a reasonable", "Author": "SWA", "ReviewID": "RHFL16Y9QO6BY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The goal was to get a high-quality, easy to carry, no-hassles, flexible camera capable of capturing images excellently. The Panasonic LZ10K is all those things and then some. DPreview included its 8 Mb sibling in a roundup test of point-and-shoots a year ago, and the LZ8K earned top honors. After using the camera for several weeks, it's easy to understand why.The LZ10K is well designed and comfortable to use. Everything is right where it should be and works splendidly. That includes the menu system. The camera manual -- kudos to Panasonic for actually providing a printed manual -- is decent, although loaded as it is with icons and other symbols, it would be nice if it were a bit larger. (I can't judge the included software because I haven't used it.)I rate the LZ10K with four out of five stars for features for one reason: it lacks an optical viewfinder. The LCD is big, bright and contrasty. It gains up well in low light. But even so there are times when a little window to look through would be much more helpful. So would being able to brace the camera against my face. What could it add to the cost, $5, $10, $15? I'd gladly pay that difference.There was one other minor letdown. The fact the LZ10K has full manual capability was a big selling point. However, I'm disappointed the camera switches to ISO 100 in manual mode and there's no way to change it. I would love to be able to at least set it to ISO 400 or 800, in addition to the ISO 100 default.Still, those two feature issues won't keep me from recommending the LZ10K. The price is remarkably reasonable for a camera this well made and designed, and one that delivers images of this quality. If anything were to happen to this LZ10K, I'd buy another without thinking twice.", "Date": "January 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice point and shoot", "Author": "A.

As for what it is advertised to do it does do the job.  Its a nice alternative to the nikon when I can't bring it.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because to two things.  First, it takes a lot a battery power, and when I say a lot I mean A LOT!  My rechargable batteries only last a max of about 3-4 hours.  So make sure you pack some extra batteries when planning on making a day of taking photos. Also I had some technical difficulties in that when I asked the camera to do some of the higher functioning tasks in the A/S/M setting it would just lock down and start blinking, the only way to remedy it was to turn it off and leave it off for about 10-15 seconds.  So this could be a big deal when swithching from different modes quickly to get that \"one\" shot.

The Panasonic Lumix DMC LZ10 was a nice (and inexpensive) stand-in. This camera is small (pocket-sized), and took good pictures both indoors and outdoors, in either daylight or darkness.  I wanted a camera that uses AA batteries - using NiMh rechargeables and carrying an \"emergency\" set of long-life lithium disposables worked well.  Used as back-up, one set of lithiums lasted the whole trip and still have juice.  The Lumix DMC LZ10 is not as good as my SLR, but lots easier to carry. I was satisfied with most of my pictures, proud of some.  Also, it's sturdy.  I'm embarassed to say I dropped it twice, and it still worked fine. Disadvantages are: 1. only a 5X zoom, 2. blank screen and fairly (sometimes several seconds) long re-set between pictures. My husband's Canon Powershot SX110IS also uses AA batteries.

I have even been told that I might have to accept a replacement camera - the third one I've received so far - that is a different model, with different features, from the one I bought seven month ago.  Panasonic does not offer refunds.  I am exhausted.I purchased a Panasonic Lumix DMC LZ-10S in August 2009.  The camera worked the first couple of times I used it, but then the lens would no longer focus, it would retract and the screen would go blank.  I spoke to Panasonic technical support, who had me return the camera for repair/replacement.  I was then sent a refurbished camera whose lens cover would not open.  I returned that camera and was again sent a refurbished camera.  This camera had the same problems that the first camera had.When I spoke to technical support I was told that I should ship the camera in and that a note was being included with my case saying that a supervisor should contact me concerning a refund.  After three defective cameras that seemed appropriate.  Instead, after returning the camera Panasonic sent a different model camera (DMC-FS15S)to me - a camera that did not take AA batteries, which was one of the primary reasons I purchased the LZ-10S.  I contacted Panasonic again about why I had never been contacted by a supervisor and was told that Panasonic policy was to not give refunds and that the women I had spoken to previously had not left a note for a supervisor to contact me.I was also told that Panasonic may or may not exchange the FS15S they sent me for a camera that takes AA batteries - under the terms of the warranty they are not required to replace a defective camera with the same model.
