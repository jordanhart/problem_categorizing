Canon has been playing with various mixes of features and prices with their newer models.  The model numbers are confusing, but I've gone through a few new models recently and hope this extra info may help you.Even though I do own a few older Canon DSLRs, for point and shoot I've been leaning more towards Nikon's Coolpix S series for the better pricing and some features. I did a lot of research into the various models in this price range.  The 790IS stands up well against the competition.  And for my needs it's more appealing than Canon's SD890IS , SD950IS, SD770IS or SD1100IS models.** The Nikon Coolpix S52c with Wi-Fi has all the good stuff that's included with the Nikon Coolpix S52 plus a wireless antenna for uploading pictures without syncing to your PC.  Either of these is a better value than the Canon 790 or 770 at about 30% less.  To be fair though, they cost less for a reason, since Canon has owned this market segment for a while.** 10 megapixels is a good capacity on the higher end for point and shoot cameras.  I wouldn't expect it to produce better pictures than 8 or 9 MP models.  You may have good reason to set your image size smaller within the camera.  However having the *option* of more megapixel's gives you certain large image format options you wouldn't otherwise have. Hence the meaning behind the much maligned statement, \"more never hurts.\"  That doesn't mean you always want to use more, but it's nice to be able to versus other cameras.  The 770 and 890 each also offer 10 MP and the 950 offers 12 MP, though at a much higher price.  The Nikon S600 also has 10 MP.  The 9 MP of the Nikon S52c was enough for me, so the 790's 10 MP is a slight upgrade.** 3x optical zoom is also a perfect amount that tends to not result in blurred photos.  The 950IS and the 870IS each has 5x optical zoom, but both have smaller screens and thicker bodies.  Digital zoom is irrelevant to me.** Canon's image processing is faster and more reliable than on my Nikon.  The built-in image stabilization, face detection and motion detection reduce blur.  I simply wouldn't consider a Canon without IS at this point.**Just like the Nikon, and unlike many other Canon models I was looking into, the 3 inch LCD screen is too beautiful to ignore.  No view-finder here, but with this beautiful screen you don't really need one.  The Nikon's screen is best of all, and made from a nicer glass that seems more durable.  But this Canon is just as big and very nice as well.** In terms of memory compatibility, Canon's lead this group.  Just like the Nikon they support SD and larger SDHC cards.  And they also support the wide range of MMC, MMC Plus, and HC MMC Plus.  No usable card is included, but you can get a nice 8 GB SDHC for only 30 or 40 bucks.** All those common extras for in-camera editing are included here.  The Canon has a lot of extra shooting modes too.  These may aid casual users a lot, but you have to spend some time studying the manual and playing with them.  I haven't used them all a great deal, but I'm generally happy with using minimal adjustments instead of the shooting modes.** The control wheel and buttons are intuitive but not as tactile as on the Nikon.  I'm not crazy about the flattened buttons.  But if you really want a Canon with a 3 inch screen, you give up the buttons.  As for the wheel, those not used to it should have no trouble adjusting.** The other advantage of the Nikon S52 is the internal zoom.  That means no waiting for the lens to zoom in and out, and no worries about the mechanical issues with those external lens extension cameras. It is possible to view pictures on the 790 IS without activating the lens by pressing the view button.  But for taking pictures, the lens articulates out.** The slim chiseled body of this Canon is very comparable to the S52 and more attractive than the rounder and fatter 870, 890 and 950.  I still prefer the Nikon body design, but the Canon definitely feels more solid in your hand.** Picture taking is better feeling on the Canon, with a more effective button design, less lag and faster shutter.  It's true that some manual controls aren't available here, but it's a point and shoot.  Step up to a bridge model like the Canon G9 or the Nikon P80 if you want more manual controls.** Low light performance is better with the Canon in auto but better with the Nikon when the ISO is set manually.  On balance I think the S52 is better in this area.** The wireless upload feature is a nice extra on the S52c.  Connecting to a wireless access point takes some time.  This is not a feature I plan on using often, but considering even the S52c is significantly less pricey than the 790 it's almost like a freebee.  Upload speeds are too slow for video, but for pictures it will do in a pinch.** The video recording features are pretty similar but slightly better on the Canon.  The video quality is great on both and sound quality could be improved on both.** The Canon PowerShot SD870IS and the Nikon Coolpix S600 each offer widescreen lenses.  The 790IS is on the cusp of wide-lens aperture. The SD870IS is clearly the most popular camera in that group.  Like the S600 it also has an externally articulating lens, so it's less compact than the S52.  The S600 is a serious competitor but the 790IS is still nicer looking and the 870IS is much more popular.  The 870IS has a ton of in depth reviews out there, so look them up.** All of the ELPHs have proprietary rechargeable batteries.  Plan on recharging them often and buying a spare battery.  You'll also need to buy a little case for this camera.  Some bridge models like the Nikon Coolpix P60, Canon PowerShot A590IS and Canon PowerShot A720IS offer the convenience of AA batteries.  If you plan on travelling a lot internationally, being able to use AAs comes in handy.This is a great camera, and probably the best Elph out there right now.1)  If you plan on shooting a lot in auto mode and want a thin camera with the 3 inch screen, the 790IS is the way to go.2)  If you think you might use the Wifi upload feature, prefer the internal lens or are looking for the best value, the S52c or S52 is the way to go.3) If you don't need the 3 inch screen and just prefer Canon to Nikon, go with the 770 IS or the 1100 IS to save some cash.4) If you need something that doesn't force you to use those proprietary batteries and chargers, check out the P60, A590 or A720.5) If you want a little wider lens capabilities and don't mind spending a little more cash, look at Nikon S600 and the very popular Canon 870IS.I know this is a lot to digest.  I hope you can benefit from this info and the recent spree of camera purchases I've made.Enjoy your new camera.", "Date": "May 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Fantastic Camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2I3MY6N9XUAJR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon PowerShot SD790IS 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized ZoomI did a lot of research before purchasing this camera. I have been disappointed and frustrated by the last three or four digital cameras I purchased, and got a little wiser this time. I mostly use my cameras for vacations and snapshots, nothing earthshattering, but I have, in the past, had a lot of trouble with blurry, vague, dark pictures, except with my very large digital Kodak, which is too big to take on an upcoming trip.I purchased a 4G highspeed sd card and an extra battery and leather case along with this camera. When I received it, I charged it, actually read the manual, then started taking lots of photos, and I am having a great time with it. Maybe this will turn me into a half way decent photographer.My initial battery charge is lasting a very long time, (two weeks +, and it is still fully charged) and the pictures are the best I have ever taken.I am blown away by all the things this camera will do, and how easy it is to figure out, all in a small but sturdy package.Most of all, I am super happy with the quality of the photos, and cannot recommend this camera highly enough. I was a little concerned initially at the lack of an optical view finder, but the screen is excellent, and its brightness level is adjustable. The camera turns on and is ready to use almost instantly, and focusses quickly. Pictures turn out sharp and clear, even with the flash, the zoom works easily with a very accessible button, and there is absolutely no red eye.I cannot give you a very technical review, I am just a regular casual user.I am very impressed, having fun, and cannot recommend this camera highly enough, it exceeds all my expectations.", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Truly Point & Shoot - A Fantastic Camera", "Author": "R. Kinslow", "ReviewID": "R1A5X9AH5MDK6O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm getting married in two months, so I began looking for a camera for use on the honeymoon, to replace my Casio EX-Z57.I'm hardly a professional photographer; mostly I take pictures of family and friends in party situations, or scenery.Ideally my new camera would fit easily in my pocket, would have a large LCD screen suitable for reviewing pictures at parties, and would produce great pictures on the \"automatic\" settings.  Manual settings are lost on me; I don't want to mess with the F-stop setting, white balance, or focus.I started doing quite a bit of research, and was a little intimidated by the number of models on the market.  I created a spreadsheet to sort through the 25 most popular models on amazon.My primary criteria was:LCD Screen SizeThicknessResolutionSecondary Were:Optical ZoomPriceThis camera ended up on top.  I summoned my courage, added it to my cart, and hit \"checkout\".I received the camera 3 days later, and fell in love on the first day of using it.Observations:The 3.0\" LCD screen is bright, and is clearly visible even in bright sun.  I don't miss the viewfinder.The camera is very small (3.6 x 2.2 x 0.8) and fits easily into my pocket.  Surprisingly light, much more so than my old Casio, which was the same approximate dimensions (3.5 x 2.3 x 0.8).Pictures taken on the \"auto\" mode look beautiful, both on the computer screen and my 42\" plasma.  Colors seem accurate, and everything is very crisp.  People's faces don't look washed out, or orange.  For additionaly testing, I took pictures in bright sun, of faraway objects, and things up close (about 4 inches), and everything came out great.Video is surprisingly good, but VERY file sizes are large.  My first video was about a minute and a half, and was about 150 Megabytes.  Played on Playstation 3 (the Casio wouldn't).The 3x optical zoom works fine.  I expected a little more for a camera in this pricerange, but I realize you have to sacrifice something for a camera to be this thin.Concerns:I was worried that I wouldn't like the \"new\" buttons, which aren't actually buttons at all, but similar to a Motorola Razr.  They work well so far though.The scroll wheel.  It actually rotates, unlike one you'd see on an iPod.  As a mechanical engineer, I know moving parts will wear out.  Durability may be an issue, but on the plus side, it has really improved navigation through the menus.Overall, it's a fantastic camera, and has exceeded all my expectations.  I would reccommend it without reservations to any of my friends, and am looking forward to the pictures it will take of my honeymoon.5-Stars", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Impressed", "Author": "B. Mitchell", "ReviewID": "RBI7B0B9UDH2W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now first things first. I am upgrading from a Sony p-72 3.2 mega pixel camera that I got back in 2003. So there are many cameras out there that would be a big step up.I was only interested in a point and shoot and it had to be compact for traveling purposes. I would love a DSLR but they are pricey, bulky and did not fit my daily needs.I started reading around for a month or so to see what was out there and read all the pros and cons. I have read so much that I finally grew sick of it. In its basic form, all point and shoot cameras have +'s and -'s. It all depends on features that are most important to you and how you will be using the camera.After many reviews, forums, and websites I decided to go with the Canon 790IS. I was very apprehensive on the quality of picture this camera would provide due to manufacturers pushing the limitations of the sensor. The sweet spot for most point and shoots are 6-8MP.So what drew me to this camera?I was really impressed with the size, screen size, material that the camera was made out of (not cheap plastic), and most of the automated settings which make the camera very easy/quick .I didn't want to have to mess with manual settings on a point and shoot. My impression of a point and shoot is it is ready to go when I need it. Maybe 5-10 seconds to change the macro but that is it. If I have to spend much more than that, great picture opportunities would be lost.So I took the plunge and bought it here off of Amazon in addition to a 8 gig Sandisk ultra II for pictures and a spare battery.I am not going to go into what the camera comes with as other people have done a great job with that already.After three days of waiting, I got the camera.I was quickly impressed on the startup speed of the camera and quality of the pictures. I took 150 in the first day. The battery is still going strong.I also tried the higher ISO settings and they will only be good on a tripod. The 3200 iso macro that is in the camera is really good. It downgrades the 10 MP to 2ish but makes a really dark shot seem to be early evening. I used it many times and it worked great. Way better than what I am use to. You can do it manually but need to keep the camera stable or you will get a blur.I have had the camera for almost a month and I am very pleased with it.You can't go wrong with the Amazon price. It is 100$ lower than retail.The camera is very well built and does an excellent job as a point and shoot. Even quick when using the flash. So again, you need to look at what you will use the camera for and what features are important to you. This one satisfied all of my requirements and I am very happy with my purchase.As a side note:I recommend getting a screen protector for the large screen. It will be easily scratched if you put in your pocket with change or other objects.Just keep in mind you get what you pay for in screen protectors. Boxwave ones are highly rated and last forever. IT would suck to get a scratch across that beautiful 3inch screen.", "Date": "July 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera", "Author": "C. Anderson \"Creighton\"", "ReviewID": "R23FDREY3KWFA2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera before going on a European Cruise (I'm American).Pros:1. Camera films great standard video (640 by 480).2. Camera pictures are good under all lighting conditions and are 10 MP.3. Camera does TIME-LAPSE video, taking a picture every 1 or 2 seconds (you choose) to film scenes over a long time.  I used it to video a home renovation project.  It was a lot of fun to look at afterwards.4. Camera can sense which way you're holding the camera and shifts the image on the screen just like the iPhone does!  Great during playback of video and  still shots to always fill up the whole screen.5. Camera has a lot of interesting special effects, like color swap, black and white with only one color developed (ex: black and white landscape with blue sky showing as blue).6. Very small and easy to put in your pocket.  It was great for my trip.  I left my bulky 10MP SLR and Mini-DV camcorder at home, why lug that stuff around when this camera takes awesome pictures and video!7. Can take 1000 high quality pictures (10MP) with one 4GB card or 45 minutes of video!8. The camera can track and recognize your face so that it always focuses on your face.  This is amazing because you can watch it track (little white square) a person's face on the viewfinder as you set up a shot.9. HUGE screen. I didn't buy a case and the screen never became scratched.10.  It shows you how much battery life you have left.  Batteries lasted over a day with very heavy use of taking and viewing both video and TONS of pictures. I bought an extra battery just in case.  Batteries were fully charged in under 2 hours.Cons:1.  It takes maybe 5 minutes to get used to the menu system, but after the initial learning curve it's easy to use.2.  The 4GB memory cards couldn't be read by the photo shop or my SD card reader because the larger GB format is new and requires updated card reader equipment.", "Date": "August 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Comparing Canon PowerShot Digital ELPH cameras", "Author": "Julie Neal", "ReviewID": "R11X7NNJRQSMTW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a travel writer I spend a lot of time at Walt Disney World, and Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs are the most common cameras I see. Families seem to love them, because they're so easy to carry and operate. About the size of a deck of playing cards, each of these \"pocket cameras\" really do slip right into a pants pocket, and their rectangular designs make them easy to grip. Best of all, they all take good photos. (How do I know? Because I've actually gotten to use every one of these models. Nearly every day guests ask me to take photos of them with their own cameras, which most often are Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs.)Here's my breakdown of the ten bestselling Digital Elph models. Any of the first six are superb choices:1ST PLACE: SD1100 ISAn update to the SD1000 (see below), this 2008 8MP beauty adds image stabilization, a slightly longer zoom (38-114 mm), another MP of photo size and a small indent on the right side for a better grip. Plus it comes in colors! My daughter has a blue one and uses it every single day. During school days the image stabilization made a real difference in her on-the-bus shots. With that heavy of use hers has gotten scratched up a bit, but the marks are small and hardly noticeable.2ND PLACE: SD870 ISThe ELPH to buy if you want a wide-angle lens. Slightly thicker than the SD1100 IS, this 8MP model doesn't have an optical viewfinder which makes it tough to use in bright sunlight, otherwise there's little not to love. My husband uses one as a comp camera, to compose shots for the travel guide \"The Complete Guide to Walt Disney World.\"3RD PLACE: SD770 ISJust released in May, this 10 MP model is, in a way, an update of the SD1100 IS (see above). I rate it lower because it costs about $50 more and doesn't come in colors. On the other hand, it has a longer battery life than the 1100 and features an improved LCD screen that is very easy to view. As for photo quality, I can't tell the difference.4TH PLACE: SD950 ISThere's a lot to like in this 12.1 MP camera. First off, it's gorgeous. The body, though a little thick, is titanium. An upgrade to the SD850 IS (see below), it has a 3.7x zoom lens and adds manual controls as well as the ability to stitch together panoramic images. The only reason I don't rate it higher is the price.5TH PLACE: SD890 ISWant a long zoom lens? Here's your baby, a 2008 10 MP model with a 5x zoom. Also has the new bright LCD screen and all the other 2008 Canon goodies. The most expensive Canon PowerShot ELPH.6TH PLACE: SD790 IS (The camera on this page)With the same 10 MP image sensor and 3x zoom lens as the SD770 IS, this 2008 model stands out only for its larger 3-inch LCD display and, as a result, lack of optical viewfinder. The rear controls are different, too, with a flatter design that uses fewer buttons.7TH PLACE: SD1000In my opinion there's no reason to buy this 7.1 MP model. Released in 2007, it's been replaced by the SD1100 IS (see above). The SD1000 is a fine camera, but it doesn't have image stabilization, a key feature of the 2008 lineup. We have one ourselves, although we don't use it anymore since we got the 1100.8TH PLACE: SD850 ISThe ancestor to the SD890 IS, this 8 MP Elph combines a 4x zoom and 8 MP photo size with an image stabilizer. Every button, dial and switch has a quality feel. Slighter larger than the other models here, it is a little tougher to pop in and out of your pocket, but if you have larger hands it may be just what you are looking for.9TH PLACE: SD800 ISThis 7.1 MP predecessor to the 870 doesn't focus well at its edges when set at its widest angle. Unless it's priced really cheap, get the 870 instead.10TH PLACE: SD750The 2007 PowerShot flagship offers a light meter that adjusts for facial brightness, 17 shooting modes, some first-rate movie features and red-eye correction -- features that were innovative a year ago but are common in Canon's latest models. No image stabilization; no optical viewfinder.

Some I kept (and paid for) and some I returned. I have gotten to try a lot of canons and this one is the best I've used. I've got to try several \"A\" powershots and \"SD\" powershots and out of all this one seems to perform the best.I have a Canon EOS 40D which has 10 megapixels and is an extremely good camera. When I looked at photos from this camera and the 40D, both being 10 megapixels I was shoocked at the quality of this small point and shoot for less than $200. The pictures were almost identical in quality. Its really hard to see any differences. I like to test cameras with macro using coins. When you take a macro photo with this camera and the 40D on both you can see every little scratch, imperfection and dust. I was blown away by this camera at such a good price (right now $183).Of course no camera is perfect. One thing I don't like about this camera is that while recording video, the zoom function is only digital zoom and not optical, like that on the Samsung nv24hd. But the picture quality is far superior here than the samsung. But this camera doesn't have HD recording and the samsung excels at that, video is incredible with a fast comptuer or PS3.Battery like is over 50% longer on this powershot than my last one, the SD630.

The Canon has been getting the shots a million times better than the Sony.

About 2 years of use and no defects or issues.  We are still not happy with the limited movie mode (focus and zoom) and we have had few issues with the dial on the back... seems we are used to it.  In lower light, indoor settings, we have not gotten as many good pictures as we had with our higher end Canon S3, but this is only a point-shoot camera.  We still recommend this camera and we get very nice comments from those that see it in use.  It is very portable, excellant construction and usually good photos result.", "Date": "August 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "The best present ever!!!", "Author": "C.LoveSmith", "ReviewID": "RS213Q6GBOZZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I searched for the BEST point and shoot out there for over a month!

When she received it, it soon became clear that her disappointment at the camera's greater overall size and weight, its rather off-beat flat-panel styling, and its more complicated setting system (a rotating ring) made a greater impression than the 1/2\" larger viewing screen.So I exchanged it for the camera I had at first thought was definitely the inferior choice: the SD1100.  When the SD1100 first appeared, several camera review sites (and Cnet) greeted it with moderate enthusiasm at best, suggesting it was little more than a cosmetic touch-up (because of the blue, pink, brown colors) of the SD1000.  But that's only half true, because the SD1100, like the SD790, incorporates face and motion detection as well as image stabilization.  Moreover, the most popular and trusted Consumer Magazine has recently called it the Best Buy available in a point and shoot model of any brand.  And if a clincher were needed, Amazon's pricing provided it (currently a difference of sixty).  So I ordered the SD1100 (in silver, of course) and, among other things, have become more aware of the advantages that a viewfinder can provide (excessive sun will still wash out the image on a viewing screen; a larger viewing screen is more prone to breakage, in which case a viewfinder becomes indispensable).I wish I could give the SD790 4 and 1/2 stars because the pictures are equal in quality to the SD1100 (and if it makes you feel any better, the lens boasts an extra 2 megapixels).  But the SD1100 adheres more closely to the size, weight, and styling of the Elf that has become a \"classic\"--and along with the speed, dependability and convenience, it produces pictures to my eyes that are second only to a full-sized SLR camera.  On the other hand, if you plan to limit your shooting to indoor portrait photography and to blow up your shots much beyond 10 X 12\", the SD790 is a compelling choice among the Elves.", "Date": "October 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly good point and shoot", "Author": "Eliot Axelrod \"Red Letter\"", "ReviewID": "RZT2WLTSFAOF4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just bought my first digital camera after only shooting film slrs for over 30 years.

I've come up from several canons, most recently the SD1000 which I loved.  This camera takes superior pictures if you use the highest settings.  They are crisper with greater detail and slightly richer color. In fact some pictures are just extraordinary.  This cameras weakness is in low light settings, although if you were in manual mode and experiment a little you can get fairly nice results at night, even indoors. HOwever the camera shines in exterior settings in the sunshine.  What I don't like is the new experimental interface.  It's very cumbersome, particularly the wheel.  It's no ipod touch wheel.  Intsead you find yourself spinning it around accidently changing your flash settings and ISO settings while you try pick the right mode which usually takes several trys.  Very frustrating.  The other buttons which are not buttons work although they don't have the same satisfying feel as the older style.  Also the only way to change mode is to use the wheel and you cant access using the menu as you used to do.  Can't figure out why they did this.  This also means that if you use this camera with the waterproof case. You will only be able to toggle between two modes.The only other con with this camera is the somewhat dumbed down settings.  You get a little flexibility in manual mode but no where near what  one would want or would have been easy to build into the software.

There is an \"Optical Image Stabilizer\" which reduces the blur of any camera movement, even with low light. There is also a cool feature called, \"Face Detection WB\" which means the camera concentrates upon faces, then it calculates \"white balance\" for the best colors and tones. You can also just select ONE face among the group to highlight (think Birthday parties)!There is a cool \"red-eye\" correction that identifies and corrects red-eye when pictures are taken. You can also later detect and correct \"red-eye\" during image playback.The camera is smaller and thinner than my previous Nikon and it fits very easily into any pocket (be careful!). It's quick, easy and responds readily. It is a great value for the price. The pictures are just as good (maybe better) than my old camera.

While the XSi is truly a great camera in its class, my wife is intimidated by its size and functions.  And with two young children running around, its also not practical to carry around everywhere. So to please the wife and ensure a camera would be available, I decided to purchase the 790IS to have a go-everywhere camera.The 790IS is a nice looking camera encased in a metal shell.  Its offers 10MP images using Canon's DIGIC III processor which produces stunning pictures for point and shoot. It has numerous automatic and manual picture taking settings and the menu is intuitive. It allows for video recording with various settings within, most importantly Standard, E-Mail, and Time-Lapse recording. Standard recording produces stunning video but at a cost; it uses large amounts of memory. The camera features a 3\" high resolution screen with tilt control which orientates the pictures to the position of the camera being viewed.  Automatic Focusing, Face Recognition and Image Stabilization ensure your taking the only sharpest pictures. Canon completes the hardware by including a 32mb SD Card (although small it something to start you off with) and the software necessary to view, save and edit the photos you take.An interesting ability of the camera is its Auto-Stitch feature.  Basically it allows you to take several pictures and then stitch them together to make a giant panoramic or 360 degree view picture.I am also impressed with the battery life of the camera. I was worried that battery life would be an issue with a sub-compact camera especially when it uses a proprietary format. But I have been amazed by how many pictures this has be able to take before needing a charge.

When I saw how cheap some were, I decided to finally shop around seriously. When I came across this camera, It stuck with me. Its solid construction, the big LCD screen, the face detection and Image Stabilization, 10 Mega Pixels, and customizing features at a reasonable price all appealed to me. I'm not a professional photographer, I just wanted a point and shoot camera, and let me tell you that this one goes above and beyond. My only criteria when shopping was that it be a solid camera, nice size LCD display, and 10 or above mega pixels. This one fit the bill perfectly. I actually like the flat Razr like buttons, they work great. So far, I take pictures of everything, and I love using the features like Color Swap, Color Accent, Digital Macro, and any shot you take will come out beautifully. It's also fast aswell. All in all, a great camera for the price. I actually feel its more camera for the price. Just having fun taking crystal clear pictures is enough to fork over the dough!", "Date": "January 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "sturdy and fun to use - great pictures", "Author": "artwire", "ReviewID": "R34A5SKI06ECB4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about 8 months and I keep it with me constantly - I was shocked to see the price had dropped to well below 200, since back in April it was $350!  As other reviewers have indicated, it takes wonderful, sharp, brilliantly colored pictures and  there are times I can't distinguish it from my SLR. This one is  so convenient to carry with you, you will always have your camera handy (which is half the battle when it comes to taking great pictures). A few minor quibbles  -- and these are most noticeable  if you compare the 790 to a digital SLR, rather than to another point and shoot.  I don't like to use flash if I can avoid it, and without it I  found the low-light performance  on high ISO \"auto' is not ideal -- the camera is perfectly usable up to about 800 ISO, and after that it becomes a little grainy  but the images are still usable.  One unexpected bonus -- the  video mode is quite impressive in low light, and in a pinch you can always use that instead if trying to capture a very dark scene. On the opposite end of the spectrum, you may have to scale back the flash if you're taking close ups or macro shots. Do yourself a favor and browse through the manual - there's a lot more to this one than just point and shoot. My major complaint is that it does not offer a RAW option -- that would have saved some 'missed' pictures -- there are  firmware tweaks for other models, but to date - nothing for the sd790is, so if RAW is important to you, you  may want to look at a different model that either offers raw or can be more easily hacked. For the most part, however, the large JPGs are fine and can be adjusted in photoshop, so the lack of RAW may be a non-issue for most people.I've been very pleased with the purchase -- would have been even happier if I could have saved the considerable difference in price, but ... hey, I needed it then and have enjoyed it every day since the purchase, so yes, it  was still worth it. I use a 4 and an 8 gb card and have never run out of room - even when using video and the highest resolution option for still images. The battery seems to last longer than my previous canon point and shoot. It's very sturdy and it feels good (substantial) in your hand. Screen is gorgeous. Every once in a while I miss a shot - usually because of lighting -- but it's pretty fast and generally keeps up without excessive lag time. The wheel takes some getting used to - I still have mixed feelings about it, but it's not a deal breaker. I like the weight and the feel of the camera - it feels substantial in my hand (but not heavy) and the IS helps minimize camera shake.  All in all, I give this a very positive 4 stars as a CAMERA in general, but give it 5 stars when evaluating it as a tiny point and shoot camera. You can't fairly compare this to a thousand dollar model - but in many respects the images it produces are just as good *(compared to a 30D), and it's certainly a lot more convenient. The camera you HAVE WITH YOU is better than the one you left home because it was bulky/heavy/needed external lenses, etc.  Good choice - even if you already have a bigger camera this could be a very handy 'extra'.", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "J.

I've own this camera for almost a year and it literally began to fall apart. The body of the camera started to separate. The panel the holds the strap disconnected. The camera fell off my arm to the ground and dented!! When I called Canon they told me, \"Yeah, we've had a few problems with that wristband panel.\"I also had some LCD monitor problems with strange spots showing up. I sent the camera in for repairs and Canon wanted to charge me for \"mishandling the camera\" - due to the dent caused by the camera falling. After some complaining, the company agreed to repair the camera \"as a courtesy\" on the warranty. To their credit: The camera was totally refurbished in less than a week and returned. Apparantly, the company found that the optical assembly was inoperative and had to be replaced. There were also some other \"adjustments\" that had to be done (I noticed that the side panel is now screwed into the camera.)Beyond that the camera turns itself on quite easily when it's in your pocket. The top button to switch between video and camera is easily bumped and you end up taking a video instead of an important shot. The rotating menu button is also awkward and the movement between photos jumpy.Overall, I was very disappointed. I typically use NIKON cameras but decided to try out Canon. This camera went to hell in less than a year. I had my Nikons for years and beat them up. I never had them fall apart like this. The camera is refurbished now and I'll likely dump it for some other model and brand. I'm giving the camera two stars instead of one because at least the photos turned out decent and many of the extra features on the camera were nice.

The quality is impressive and the camera is small, compact and feels right in hand despite being so small. The screen is amazingly large, giving the photographer unexpected amounts of image when previewing pictures. The quality of the screen is very good and the image stabilization makes a huge difference.However, one must be careful that these qualities start eating at the robustness of this camera.For example, the camera is compact and to achieve a size smaller than a deck of cards, the viewfinder had to go. That limits the angle from which you can preview and you may get some pictures wrong because you look at the previewing screen from an angle that you can't see well. The compact size limits the length of the zoom also. One would know this from researching the specs.To get a large screen you expose a large surface of ... well ... LCD panel.

SmartAUTO technology seems to be the culprit, in addition to increased pixel size affecting the quality.  And oddly, the DIGIC III seems to also outperform the newer version processor.The SD1100 VGA video also outperforms Panasonic's LUMIX VGA & WVGA, and shockingly comes close to Canon's HD quality.  The major difference: screen size. But for PC/Mac viewing, I find VGA size acceptable.. not to mention file size for non compressed HD can get enormous.After doing a lot of research and picking the brains of several Canon reps, I discovered that Canon released the SD790 after the SD1000 using the same 35mm lens, only with a larger 3\" LCD screen vs 2.5\" for the SD1100.See this link: [...]So I decided to buy a Canon SD790 refurb for only [...] and I must say, THIS IS ONE AMAZING CAMERA constructed of metal, not cheap plastic and feels bullet proof.  The large 3\" LCD screen is amazing for an older model.The STILL PHOTO quality is identical to that of the SD1100 and beats the SD780 quality with similar 35mm lens (not wide 28mm).  I've said it before though: SmartAUTO on the newer models creates horrible photos indoors.  You must use PARTY mode or PORTRAIT.  AUTO feature on the SD790 seems to work like a charm.  You don't get the yellow (poor white balance) tint on human skin on this model and the SD1100.Another KEY setting for the SD790: the focus system. If its set on CENTER this may cause \"blur\" problems raised by others' reviews.  If you don't hit your subject perfectly, then the photos will blur and focus on the wrong object. With FACE DETECTION, it works 100% of the time for me.  The other focus setting tries to capture the closest object, and seems to work very well.DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR THE BEST CANON AND BEST POINT & SHOOT I'VE OWNED.

Sometimes I would rotate it 360 degrees and it will do nothing.  I know they improved the wheel in newer models (SD880, etc.)  Does anybody have this difficult time rotating the wheels?  I don't know if it's just my camera because when I went to a couple of stores to check it out, they were spinning more freely.It was hard to write this review because I couldn't decide between 5 stars or 3 stars, so I gave it a 4.

The camera has a slow shutter lag but the images were sharp and the zoom was quite useful at times.  I purchased the new 790IS for a trip to Africa because it was more suitable for travel conditions and because it still had built in optical stabilization.  The image quality suffers from over correction.  The flash is so focal that images blur from the reflection.  Also disconcerting is the enclosure for the mini-USB connection which is quite flimsy and the placement of the directional buttons are annoying as they sit precisely where your thumb naturally settles when you go to take a picture.  There is a lot to like about this camera but the image quality, combined with the user interface makes for a less than appealing camera.For the number of years that have passed since the S2 came out, I would've thought that compact digital camera quality would have improved more.

Battery life is very good, and with minimal use of the flash, can easily power the camera for several days.

I'm a working pro, and played a bit with the G9 & G10, but found them to be too big.

This is my third digital camera.  My first was an early Canon which I was very happy with.  I updated it then with the Kodak V550 and unfortunately in the future I'm afraid all of my digital camera purchases will be measured against it.  I LOVED the Kodak V550 and only sought out a new camera when it died after years of being overworked.  Ok, back on task here. I researched heavily before purchasing the SD790.  My purpose was to find the best price for decent quality photos in a camera that would fit in my purse or pocket.  My main objects of photography are family and travel.  Pros: There were several cameras of which I decided to take a closer look.  Ultimately, and I'm a little embarrassed to admit this, I decided on this particular model because of it's looks.  It is beautiful and sleek just as the V550 was.  I prefer the square lines and simplicity of the buttons over ugly dial knobs and rounded corners.  I have been happy with the quality of the photos and video.  I'm sorry to say that I've not ever installed the software so am not qualified to comment on it.  I use another photo software.  I love the large viewing area.  I ordered an extra battery but so far have not had to use it.  The battery life is very good.  Cons: No viewfinder. I don't like not having one.  I rarely used it before so thought I could do without it but when you need it, you need it.  I also don't like having to remove the battery and place it in a separate charger.  This may be common place but both of my previous cameras were chargable without removing the battery.  This is my biggest dislike which has nothing to do with quality but convenience. Compared to my Kodak, the menu is harder to figure out but with more use I'm sure I'll get used to it.  I can happily recommend this camera.  I'd give it a 5* on looks alone but the little things I don't like about it keep me from doing so.", "Date": "December 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "A Tale of Three Treasures!", "Author": "Ms_Ladi \"...just wandering the world.\"", "ReviewID": "R1NHCJRP124GJB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is a combination of three:Canon PowerShot SD950IS 12.1MP (Titanium)Canon PowerShot SD770IS 10MP (Silver)Canon PowerShot SD790IS 10MPI first purchased the Canon SD950, and after loonnnggg shipping from Jr.com, I received it and tried it out.  The camera is much bigger than the SD500 that I upgraded from--even though it's got so many bells and whistles.  One thing about Canon that's got my eyebrow raised:  Why the big font as if we can't read?The Image Stabilization is a wonderful thing, right along with the face detection.  It even focused on an enlarged print of a little girl!  The 3.7 zoom is nothing to frown at either.  ISO is easier to set now so one can play around with the settings...The camera is made for \"big hands\" and it took me about two weeks of off and on shooting to get used to it.  The 12MP quality is okay, and I didn't have to get used to too much new button placement.  One thing I didn't like is the play button.  I felt I had to really push my finger on the play button in order to view my photos.  It annoyed me enough to see what else was out there.The Canons SD770 and SD790 were next on my list.  Even though they were \"only\" 10MP, they had newer technology from Canon:  Motion Detection and Infinity and cute buttons in all new small packages.SD770IS(Silver)First the SD770.  This was a nice small camera!  Not cheap feeling at all, Canon packed everything but the kitchen sink in there.  I like the \"Infinity\" setting that the SD950 didn't have.  Also, I have the silver version and it's nice, small, sleek, and takes great pictures.  I didn't like the way the battery cover was not spring loaded.  Also, either it was this particular camera or the 770 in general, but it seemed like I had to \"dig\" for the battery and SDHC card once put in.  Yes, it's compact, hefty, and full of bells and whistles, but it was...kinda boring.  Maybe because the silver color didn't have the pizazz of the black version that I'd read reviews on.  Moving on to the SD790...SD790ISBigger camera!  Compared to the 770, it's a giant!  The same size as the 950 except in a square/cube like form.  The 950 is curvy, while the 790 is sleek and boxy (not sure if that's an oxymoron or not!).  The 790 also has a new button format that I'm not sure if I like or not.  I really enjoyed the SD500's button placement and while I can appreciate a \"play\" button...why not make it easy access instead of having to constantly press the button down?  I'm thinking that the play buttons will eventually wear out.  The big screen is nice, and even though I haven't used a viewfinder since...ever, it would be nice to \"just have\".  So the lack of a viewfinder is a potential bummer.  You never know when you gotta smear your nose on the photo screen to take pic!  lol  Also, the 790 is a fingerprint magnet.I tried to take the same pictures with all the cameras, but couldn't always (morning/evening, different zoom, etc.).  Both the 770 and 790 have high ISO settings (as did the 950), but I didn't even use anything that high previously!  All the pictures came out great.  Even my crappy pictures of my messy coffee table were clear and colorful!  One issue I had with all three cameras was the color accent setting.  It seemed as if I got better black and white/one color photos from my SD500 than either of these cameras.  I have to do a lot more tweaking.  However, it could be just because of the balances of the colors and the lighting effects in my environment.If I just had to choose based on portability, photos, looks, bells/whistles, ease of use, I would go crazy trying to decide.  Both cameras are amazingly small!  The thing that keeps me wondering about the 770 is, \"how can they fit all these specs in this TINY camera!??  But, I'm a sucker for good looks, so the scale points back to the SD790!  True it's bigger than the 770, but it's still small considering the screen.  I always take great care of my electronics, so I'm not so worried about fingerprints.

HOWEVER, about a month ago (September 2010) my screen started going black... No image would show up through the lens although the menu items would still show up.

I got a pre-paid mailing label from them, sent the camera into their US repair facility outside Chicago, and was notified within a week that it would cost me $129 to repair.  Forget it!

It took beautiful photos, I had them uploaded to my online account, ordered canvas prints of different shots after see what the print photo looked like first. Love it. I've had canon camera's for years. I used to have a 4MP, and it's great.But, now I have the 10MP camera and love it. The expert photographers say the 12.1 is good of the canon, but the down side is the case is plastic. Upside is the wideangle is a bit better than the 10MP.However, in the long rung it's $130 more than I wanted to spend and I am so happy with my 10MP. Canon's are the best. Sony is not bad either. Nikons old and new still are awful and still slow. The moment won't wait or last when I have 10 littl 1yr - 9 yr old nieces/nephews running around.Even my old camera where you're waving your hand in mid-air is captured and not blurred. Kids jumping on the trampoline in mid-air are awesome shots. Scenic photos of islands carribean water and the beautiful red rock of Sedona are so awesome. Even snapshots of the park, gardens, and old black and white prints of buildings look amazing.From now on, no more buying artwork at best buy or online. You can print and order your own prints online for much less and they're scenes you've experienced and take with you for the rest of your life. Love love love my new canon!!Also, I spoke with camera experts at both Best Buy and B&H; photography. They agree with my camera purchase choice. If you're planning on doing much much more, then spend the extra dough. But for what I need to do and get done, this is the perfect camera for time to come. If I want to take a photography class and need a more upscale camera, I may do that, but for now this camera is perfect for the price and for the value I'm getting.If you are planning to buy this camera, thumbs up and enjoy your new camera.

Grimes", "ReviewID": "RYIONV8W3NBQ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a long search for a new digital camera, what caught my eye about the SD790IS was the new user interface on the back of the camera.  Instead of using the traditional buttons like my old SD630 or SD450, Canon has redesigned the UI with a touch pad wheel and flat panel keys like a cell phone.  It was very easy to get used to and its very intuitive.  It took about 5 minutes to master it.The biggest advantages on this camera were Image Stabilization, SDHC compatibility, 10 mega pixels, as well as a simple button to go to playback mode.  You don't have to slide a toggle switch like my older Canon unless you want to go to video mode like on the sd450 and sd630.Image stabilization works great.  It really guards against blurry photos when you have plenty of light.I shopped around a long time and I'm very satisfied with this camera.  The new UI is a huge improvement and I'm really happy with it.  The only drawback on this camera?  I think its time for Canon to redesign the OS and menus.  There is much more they can add.Many reviewers have mentioned the size and weight of this camera as drawbacks, but I just don't see it.  I have the SD790IS and my g/f has the SD770IS.  Side by side, her camera is the same size...it may be 1/10th of an inch slimmer overall, but the difference is really negligible.

After about 3 months of using it I am so pleased with this little camera I feel obligated to add a review of my own.I decided to upgrade from a 6mp Sony T9 after noticing that my pics from my last trip came out a bit on the soft side and lacking detail.  After taking a few test shots I was very pleased with the quality of the images the SD790 produces.  The detail is fantastic and the colors come out very true to life.  One thing that bothers me a bit though is that this camera exhibits a little corner blur in shots taken at wide angle.  This is only really a problem though when you zoom in on the corners; at normal resolution it doesn't stand out all that much.This camera has a decent amount of manual controls for a compact point and shoot.  I am especially pleased with the ability to set the shutter for long exposures (up to 15 sec) so you can actually take some pretty good night shots.While there are a few minor annoyances such as the zoom setting not being displayed and the mode selection wheel being very finicky these problems become negligible when you take into account how great the images this device captures are.

The camera has a variety of features, a convenient turn wheel for camera options, and is worth the extra price for the Image Stabilizer; because I normally shoot with a SLR (Canon 20D)I was looking for a solid camera that offered these options in a user friendly way.  This camera lives up to my expectations. However, the camera is not without its weaknesses:  it processes slow after pressing the shutter button(the same frustration with my old Canon Elph S500), it is heavy for its size, only offers 3x optical and 10MP(while others offer 5x and 12MP at comparable rates), and it is very hard to wipe off finger prints on the screen and body--even with a microfiber camera cloth (other bodies are manufactured from scratch resistant material).  It's a toss up between this model and the SD950IS, but I like the sleekness of the SD790IS and the turn wheel on the back of the camera.

Very happy with the extra options as well.  I had taken some pictures in the park with lots of greenery and the foliage selection does indeed make a difference.  The colors were just so natural and crisp when compared to the regular portrait option.  I also liked the Color accent where only one color is shown and the rest is in black and white.  This gives the photos a nice artistic touch.  The camera was also very good at taking pictures with not much light, something my other camera (Kodak) had trouble with.  This thing starts up very quick, seriously about half a second after pressing the power button it's ready so you won't have trouble at getting that unexpected picture during your picture taking.
