{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera. I love it.", "Author": "Mac", "ReviewID": "R2J9YGZOLUYK8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a few weeks ago. It is my first camera like this and I really enjoy it! If you are looking for a good camera this is one you should get. In the kit I got a camera bag that could be just a tad bigger, a memory card that holds over 4,000 pictures, a battery charger that plugs into a wall outlet, also you can take it over sees! A starter kit to clean up the lens and whatever else needs it.it also comes with an adapter to put into the computer. And a memory card holder that holds up to 12 or more cards. And a table tripod. This tripod may not look strong but it is strong.This is a really great deal, I got it when it was on sale but you will steal enjoy it for the price.A great camera to start with.I hope this helped you on seeing the reviews.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$259.99", "Features": "14.0Mp Resolution\n3.0\" LCD Monitor\n24-720mm Fujinon 30x Optical Zoom Lens\nSD/SDHC/SDXC Memory Card Storage\n1280 x 720 HD Video Capture", "Name": "Fujifilm FinePix S4500 Digital Camera (Black).
