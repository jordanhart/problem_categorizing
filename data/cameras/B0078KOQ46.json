I have been very happy with the camera, but felt it was time to upgrade.I was all ready to pull the trigger on an FZ200, when I noticed a review for the Pentax K-01.  The review, as are most reviews for this camera, was of a low opinion of the K-01, but what caught my eye was the photo quality.  I imagine the reviews would have been of a much higher opinion with the camera now half the price of when it was released, and with a new firmware to boot...The main \"functional\" criticisms against this camera are the lack of a viewfinder and the slow auto-focus performance.  The auto-focus performance has been addressed by a new firmware, available at the Pentax web site.  The lack of a viewfinder is, in my opinion, and unforgivable oversite, but at a bit over $500 with a pair of lenses, for a camera with an 16MP APS-C sensor and Pentax K-Mount compatibility, I am willing to overlook that.  The ergonomics are also very poor in comparison to almost every other modern camera, and it is large, but I can live with that.Simply put, you cannot get higher quality images with the flexibility of lenses that the the K-01 delivers, for less money right now.  I own a few old Pentax lenses, so I am getting even more bang for my buck than others would, but even if I did not have the lenses already, I would have gone with the K-01 dual lens setup.The K-01 has reignited my interest in photography, as it gives DSLR quality photos, combined with a HUGE selection of lenses to choose from, at an affordable price.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pentax K-01", "Author": "DFSTARMAN", "ReviewID": "R3S02IZCSJ45WN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good camera for cheap pricegreat image iq kitlenses not very gooddid not like it because it does not have real live view like my other cameras", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gergeous contemporary styling", "Author": "mike b.", "ReviewID": "RQRJI3FD25S0R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't actually used this camera but I really like looking at it because it is gergeous per the product description listing.", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$999.95", "Features": "16 megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor with low noise image capture at ISO range 100-25600\nGergeous contemporary styling by world renowned designer Marc Newson\nMirrorless body design with Pentax K mount lens compatibility that allows any Pentax K mount lens  to work.\nFull HD 1080p video capture @ 30FPS with h.264 compression ( 60FPS at 720p)\nComplete w 18-55mm standard zoom & 50-200mm long zoom", "Name": "Pentax 15274 16 MP Mirrorless Body Design Camera with DA L 18-55mm and 50-200mm Lenses - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410LjJIgFOL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0078KOQ46"}}
