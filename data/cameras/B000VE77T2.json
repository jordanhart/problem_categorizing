{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Samsung i85 (Silver) --Great Product, Crisp Pics, and Easy to Use", "Author": "O. Alvarez", "ReviewID": "R39R4HT821DSXA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera after doing some lengthy research.  I looked at Casio Exilim EX-V7(suffers from mediocre image quality) or EX-v8 (probably much more comparble to this camera) and Konica Minolta Dimage X1 (also medicore picture quality) models as well, with the criteria being a small, portable camera, with a non-protruding lens.  In addition, I wanted video at least similar or better than the Flip Video Camcorders, which can do an hour of low quality video in a small package.I've owned this camera for two weeks now and used it for still images, video cam, and mp3 player purposes.  I have not tested it's ability to play videos (PMP mode) downloaded from the web.It is compatible with Windows XP (tested), Mac OS X10.5.1 (tested), and Ubuntu Linux (tested).  Windows requires the install disc which is included.  Mac and Linux auto open their respective photo viewing software for import with no additional drivers and the camera shows up as a removable hard drive on your desktop.  The included extra software only works in windows, but it is not essential except if you want to view videos downloaded from the web in your camera.  It stores images in jpg format, videos in avi format, and music up to 320kb quality as mp3 format.The image quality is excellent, with crisp, sharp pictures, and good, accurate colors.  Of course it has a million override settings which also allow you more control if desired.It's best two features are the ASR (Anti Shake Reduction) and Face Recognition capabilities.  My hands are not as steady as they used to be and the ASR produces quality shots every time.The camera is quick to shoot and there is no noticeable shutter lag (at least compared to my previous camera, a Sony DSC-S85, which is now retired).  Those other reviewers who complain of camera lag or bad photos in dark are not using the appropriate settings.  The camera has different settings, such as night, \"cafe\", fireworks, and other settings they may be what they need and they may not fully understand settings such as \"ISO 1600\", and so forth.  I encourage them to read the very clear manual and try it again...This camera uses standard SD cards and I use both a Dane-Elec 4GB 133x SD card and a  2 GB SanDisk Ultra II SD card.  I have easily recorded one hour videos with these with room to spare.  It has several settings for frames per minute and it can do 30fps at 640 x 480.  This format is easily converted into a DVD with your favorite computer software.The mp3 player produces great quality sound and has an equalizer which will adjust your music according to your preference, such as Rock, Jazz, Classical, etc.  The only drawback is that the earphones included are not up to hi fi standards and if you want to upgrade the earbuds, the earphone socket is 2.5mm in size (a smaller size which is usually used by cell phones).  If you want to plug in your Grado headphones you will need an adaptor (which is not included).In summary, I highly recommend this camera/multi-device.  If you are looking for an easy to use camera which will produce very satisfying results, this is it.Pros:Super compact, fits in your jeans pocket.Nice size LCD screen for easy viewing.Very fast start-up.ASR and Face Recognition modes are a huge help.Fast focus in most all conditions.Movie mode is incredible.Sharpness, colors, all are very pleasing.Nice build quality, polished metal casing.Cons:2.5mm earphone jack is not directly compatible with most hi fi earbuds.No carrying case included.", "Date": "January 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "this camera has one big downfall", "Author": "Jonathan March", "ReviewID": "R1AOJYW1JN6NXZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As another person has mentioned -  this camera has one big \"con\" -  when taking indoor pictures, especially of darker rooms or items, it can take an EXCESSIVE time after the flash goes off before you are able to take another picture.  Either the green standby LED keeps flashing, and /or the word \"Processing!\" comes across the screen -  sometimes for up to 12 seconds, before the camera \"comes back\" and is ready to take another shot.Another weird annoyance -  when the camera finally does recover from the last picture, there is a bug that sometimes happens with the shutter button -  it acts \"dead\" until you try pressing it 2 , sometimes 3, attempts, at which point it seems to \"wake back up\".  Weird.  You'd be really screwed at an indoor wedding if you were trying to take pictures of couples making their entrance, dances, etc.10 seconds is how long cameras took in the early 90's to recover for \"next shot\" . Inexcusable today, with 4gig SDHD cards, huge internal memory, fast processors, etc.Finally - after charging the the (very unique) battery -  it went from 3(full) bars, right down to 2 bars really quickly (doing a mix of stills & video tests) -  and subsequently dying very quickly.I used it about a half hour, and the battery was dead?!Yes -  this camera has a combination of features and image quality, thats hard if not impossible to match (next closest thing is the rather poor-pictured Casio EXV8).... but there is definitely something funky going on with the i85 that really is a fatal flaw  for indoor shooting. I called tech support, and in typical corporate-speak, they \"never heard\" that complaint, said they would email the product team to get back to me- that was only 2 business days ago.  Maybe the next revision if the otherwise great i85 will fix these problems.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera with Awesome features!", "Author": "C. Walker", "ReviewID": "RZCIF3XWMAJVH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my wife for Christmas. She loves it. I researched several cameras and found this to be the best one I reviewed without paying over $300. The picture quality is top notch. I have read many reviews for many cameras about how quality is \"grainy, blurred, blah, blah, blah\". One review summed it up well. Most cameras will perform very well, you just need to get to know your camera. That is just it! If you don't know much about the manual side of cameras, then use the auto feature. Otherwise, learn about it and use your camera's full potential. This camera has it all. The sound is great, understanding that it is a small speaker in a digital camera. Don't expect to be on a train or a busy sidewalk and be able to hear very well. It does come with ear buds, so use them. Most people don't walk around with a loud boombox up to their ear anymore. You can watch movies on this thing, just make sure you buy a bigger sd card. I bought a 4GB one and it holds a ton of pics, mp3's and vid's. The quality of video is better than most Portable media players and don't forget the 3\" screen size. The included software works great for converting movies to watch. And the biggest reason I went with this camera was its video recording capabilities. Awesome!!!! You can zoom in and out while you record, it picks up sound very well, and does a good job indoors and outdoors. I was just at a wrestling tournament for my boys and it recorded video very well. Over an hour and a half of recording with plenty of memory and battery left. Great buy, you can't go wrong!", "Date": "January 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "It's Going back...", "Author": "P. J.

My kids are running away from me!Sometimes when you push the button to take the picture, nothing happens!(I have had to push it 3-4 times)There isn't a way to adjust the red-eye manuallyThe lag time is unbelievably slow from the time you push the button until the camera actual takes the picture, 1/2 the time my subject has looked away or I have taken a picture of the floor!Processing flashes across the screen after taking pictures, so if you are at a sporting event, forget it- even on the childrens mode which is supposed to catch them.So, if you want an mp3 player that takes pictures, go for it.  If you want a camera that takes a picture when you push the shutter button, look at Sony or Cannon.", "Date": "January 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "samsung digimax camera", "Author": "C.

Wilson", "ReviewID": "R2DQ5FOW52WXHC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I searched for a few days for a camera that had high resolution with image stabilization, decent video capture, usb chargeable and a built in media player. The media player function was important because it allows me to travel light with a great camera and a way to watch movies and listen to music.  I have had this camera for over a month in Europe and have had great results. If you know how to use the settings you can take amazing  pictures in quick succession. Don't worry about battery power, you can take many pictures and video and still have enough power to listen to music for a few hours.  The wide angel setting and wise shot setting are great when combined with Photoshop CS3s photomerge option to produce seamless panoramic pictures. On the optical side, this camera performs well considering that it is fully enclosed in the cameras body. Speaking about the camera's body it is very durable because its real metal and stylish, not some cheap plastic shell.CONCLUSIONIf you want a very portable camera with extra media features and a capable camera this is it.

I bought the camera to go along with a bigger prosumer camera. Also I got myself a 2GB SDHC card for photo and video. No w I can take pictures and ... yes, it is true watch movies on the same product.Next to being a very handy camera with great picture taking qualities that you can stick away in your pocket this gadget is also a video camera and mp3player.For those who only want to use it as a camera for point and click you can do it very well. The camera comes with an impressive 5 times optical zoom and a whole range of features that will guarantee you good pictures. you do not even have to buy a memory card as the camera comes with a 180MB internal memory. This a first for me and very handy.Okay after all the hoha one point of attention and that is the clock on the back. I had to switch it off as the times it showed  on screen was impossible to understand as it showed a date never possible. However that a a minor when you know that it is stored in proper way once you transfer the pictures to a computer.The Samsung i85 is a really good camera that is too much under the radar as it competes with the big brands and their models out in the market and a for a price that is unmatched.", "Date": "December 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "battery life unacceptable", "Author": "Kim", "ReviewID": "R2RIASPGN0Q0H7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this camera for my daughter for Christmas after doing much research.  I have been terribly disappointed in the battery life.  She has to charge it before every use.  I have a Fuji Finepix that I can keep in my purse for months and use it periodically and it holds a charge for months at a time.  I called Samsung and asked why the camera would not hold a charge for more than a day at a time and they told me that is normal for this camera and there is no fix for it.  Very disappointing.

The extra features are really nice too. I'm still exploring them, but, I heard a song on the mp3 mode, the world map/tour thing is really interesting; gives you attraction sites in multiple places around the world, and the video/movie mode looks really really good too. My requirements for a new camera were, at least a 3\" lcd, compact size, and good pics. I also tested a Nikon (s52)which was more expensive, had less features and more importantly the pictures were so grainy compared to this one; it was a huge difference. So huge that I realized what a good deal I had gotten and quickly got back online and ordered another one of these for a gift.

One of my absolute favorite things about it, is that you can shoot a video and then go back and take snapshots off the video. With a big family, I have just had us all get together and look at the camera and smile while taking video. Then I go back and take a snapshot off the video when everyone was looking and smiling. The video side is a little darker, so you do need to be in a well lit area when doing video. The zoom quality is awesome and allows you to zoom in and out when recording.The only negative thing I would say about this is the battery life. When it was new the battery worked great and lasted a long time. I ended up buying 2 extra batteries off of ebay and that helped. I would have all three charged up, so when one ran out I would just switch them. It didn't take too long before it seemed like they didn't hold much of a charge at all. They were generic batteries and weren't terribly expensive though. I was talking to someone about this, and they suggested taking the battery out when the camera is off. This has actually helped tremendously. The only problem with that, is that the date and time do not stay and that is frustrating. I was hoping there was an internal battery for the date, but was unable to find any indication that there is.I have watched movies on this camera and listened to mp3s as well. Again the quality is comparable or better than the other portable video players I have! The earplugs that come with it work great, but I would like to note that they are smaller than regular headphones so don't lose them. The external speaker is actually really good also!There are tons of options and settings you can mess with. If you know what your doing, you could tweek this camera to do exactly what you want. I have just learned by playing with all the settings, and there are still more settings than I know what to do with!And on a non-technical note, I love the outside red color!!", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "No more Samsung anything!", "Author": "Lisa M.

Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "RMXFCMR0BK324", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a Samsung Camera lover for a long time. I began with the Digimax S500, then upgraded to Samsung NV3, and now I recently purchased the Samsung i85. I've tried other cameras like the Sony Cybershot DSC S730, but returned it instantly at poor picture quality and lack of image stabilization (Don't be fooled by the SONY brand name, this camera is not good!). Then I bought an Olympus FE-230, and although the picture quality was great and the camera was slim and lightweight, it was too slow at taking pictures for my taste.After my failed attempts, I bought the Samsung NV3, which is a perfect camera. It takes great pictures, amazing videos with great sound, and you can even hear MP3s on it. After having a successful buy with the Samsun NV3, I decided to upgrade and immediately fell in love with the Samsung i85. This camera has it all. It takes beautiful pictures both inside and outside. It has many features in which you can tweek your camera into taking great pictures despite the horrid conditions outside.The face recognition function, image stabilization, and ASR function make this camera perfect for portraits and up close and personal pictures. The pictures are so crisp and clear that it makes the worst looking image look beautiful. Videos turn out nice, with great sound quality; however, it is better to take videos in well lit areas. The World Tour guide function seems to be really cool and educational, but I haven't really messed around with that yet.Moving on, Samsung's i85 is a great camera for those who want great pictures, and don't want to spend too much on a digital camera. Samsung cameras are also very durable and with the internal zoom, you won't have to worry about messing up the lense. Battery life is very good, but I feel that the NV3 has a longer battery life span. The LCD display screen is huge and great for previewing pictures. I do recommend for those who are purchasing this camera to buy it either in silver or black, as they look nicer with time.Overall, this is a great camera and you'll definitely be content with your purchase!", "Date": "August 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera!", "Author": "Eric Q. Sabre", "ReviewID": "R2PPZUW1H6SVUB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had done some research on various brands (ie, Sony, Canon, Nikon, etc).  I used resource such as CNET and other review websites to include reviews from product owners that purchased various on-line stores.After all that, I found that the Samsung i85 looked like a real gem, especially for the price compared with Sony and similar high-end brands.What I found is that for a basic point & shoot ultracompact cameras, the Samsung i85 has the best bang for the buck.At first I was concerned about MegaPixels.  Then I discovered that that is just a bunch of hype when dealing with these types of cameras.  MPs between 6-10 are actually going to give most people way beyond what they need, because even if you print your pictures, you won't find a lot of quality difference.  Those with bloated MegaPixel ratings are for serious photographers that plan on making prints from poster to billboard size.  for a simple 4x6 or 8x10, you're not going to see any quality difference.So that led me to my next question about optics.  What I liked about this camera is that it surpassed every other.  5x Optical zoom AND 5x Digital zoom = 25 total zoom!  All the other cameras were in the 10 to 15 TOTAL zoom.  Samsung i85 wins that category.I also found that the i85 seemed to have one of the largest internal memories to start...190mb vs 15-32mb for the others I was looking at.  Samsung i85 wins that category.Also uses upto 4GB sdcard.  *Make sure that it is a regular sd card, I found that the Ultra Fast cards don't seem to work as well.  No problems since going to the regular speed card.Camera takes photos, video, plays mp3, even has a sports photo feature...great for taking pictures of a golf swing.Big screen, easy to use buttons.Overall, I'm really pleased with this camera.ONLY FLAW that I've discovered so far is that you can inadvertently hit the play button to see your pictures which results in the camera turning on, instead of just using the power button.

The photos are great, extra batteries are readily available and inexpensive.  I have not had any trouble with delays in shooting indoor flash pictures... two or three seconds between photos.  Maybe some who have mentioned this issue received bad samples, have slow cards, or weak batteries or some combination of these factors.The personal movie player is wonderful.  The Samsung conversion program will not directly convert a DVD into a movie that you can use on the camera.  Any ripper that can convert a Video TS file to an avi file will work.  You can then convert them into the proper format.  I already had some movies that I had converted to Palm format with DVD Pocket Wizard and the Samsung program had no trouble converting those for the i85.  Unfortunately the conversion program requires a Windows based computer.Like all cameras lacking a view finder the Samsung is hard to use in very bright sunlight because of the mirror glare on the screen.  There is an option in the settings to turn on backlighting and that does help.  But if you are a beach person you may have to use a t-shirt or something to cut down on the reflected glare.As others report, the earphone port is 2.5mm.  I am going to buy a short 2.5 male  to 3.5 female adapter cable.  If you do the same be sure to get one with the 2.5 male plug running at a right angle.

Feria", "ReviewID": "R1KHAZFK9N0A23", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am so disgusted and really disappointed with this camera. I just bought it a week ago and im not so happy with its performance. The 8 MP is totally useless compared to my old sony cybershot 7 MP which can take even better and clearer images. Plus, i can't figure out how to store MP3's from PC to the camera. I tried to follow the manual but everything is a bogus. The extra features are not user friendly at all. The zoom is bad as well and battery life is so short. This also takes VERY VERY SLOW INDOOR and night pictures. I'm thinking of returning this product but the S and H cost a lot of time plus the manufacturer charges a restocking fee. DO NOT buy this camera...I'll get myself a new Canon instead", "Date": "January 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not One Of My Favorite Electronics Purchases", "Author": "Rude Boy 1979 \"Ralph\"", "ReviewID": "R1B5P76MGVG4FZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I doubt anyone would think of buying this old model now unless they were buying it used, but mine just broke which after 4 years I can live with. But what I wanted to say was how awful this camera was for me. The camera took forever to take the picture anytime. I just bought a really cheap Kodak M532 for $80 and it blows this Samsung away. BTW this is the second Samsung product I've owned that broke in the last year. I bought a 50\" Samsung plasma TV that broke one week after the one year warranty ended and the set was used in a vacation home and unplugged while not in use so it was not used very much. I doubt I will buy any Samsung products again. But as far as the camera goes, it is not recommended by me, especially now after using a product that is 1/4 the price and 10 times better.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000VE77T2"}}
