Before you click \"add to cart\", make sure you also grab a battery and place that in your cart as well.  This does not come with one, only the adapter.

The weight is fine and will mount problem-free with your articulated arm configuration. Would definitely recommend this.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Highest Resolution for the $", "Author": "D. Wiesehahn", "ReviewID": "R36IHK099QU6EF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the highest resolution monitor for under $250. The battery plates and 4 pin xlr connector make it easy to power. It's a bargain, but of course not perfect. It has a cheap plastic feel, and many of the pro features like peaking and 1:1 are obviously absent. Also, the sun hood does not fold like on the Ruige monitors, which makes it cumbersome to transport. For not much money, it's a great focus monitor.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Feels far lighter and cheaper than I expected, even after reading reviews that said it was light and cheap", "Author": "Sick of being tricked", "ReviewID": "R2QVS0I4PQ26J9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Feels far lighter and cheaper than I expected, even after reading reviews that said it was light and cheap. That alone is a disappointment. No battery included -- must have been wishful thinking. Will try to update this after some use. Had I been able to handle it in a store I would not have spent $200 on this. You can't always judge performance or reliability by \"feel\", but this is pretty shocking and makes me more than a little wary.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Monitor", "Author": "pianopeter55 \"peter\"", "ReviewID": "RR4CTCKJRJWUY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great monitor!! comes with sunshade and a the swiggle thing! also a HDMI wire.

The kit is supposed to come with the different battery plates. Mine was missing one.

Makes a huge difference looking at a 7 inch monitor vs. A 3 inch, I wish it would have included atleast one battery. Or said on the page in big red letters that no battery would be included.

I'm a video professional. This monitor doesn't work for my professional needs; it's a toy, plain and simple. There was a blue artifact on the monitor and had to return it. Also, the aspect ratio hardly fills the whole screen and it's built like a plastic toy. If you are a hobbyist, maybe this will work for you, but try the slimmer Lilliput 668 first. Don't be tempted with this one, get another, trust me!", "Date": "June 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Doesn't work well with Canon cameras", "Author": "paul wassermann", "ReviewID": "R1USZWQXHYP7M4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Very disappointed\u2026instruction manual is essentially just a list of features, not how to use them or what they are for.  Couldn't get the output to fill the 7 inch screen except by pressing \"pixel to pixel\" but then the image isn't centered on display correctly so you can't see the red record spot (it is out of frame).  So in high res viewing you essentially have a four inch image on the 7 inch screen!  The \"blink\" is about five to eight seconds meaning you push the button to record and the monitor goes to blue screen for that length of time.  Finally customer service is awful.  I called and got a voice message to leave a phone number and \"will call as soon as possible\"  Three additional phone calls to them, five days elapsed and haven't heard anything.  Would not recommend this product without trying it first.

The only thing that was abnormal to me was when you press record on your camera, the Lilliput monitor has a short delay. And you won't be able to take advantage of using the entire screen if you're using a crop sensor camera because the aspect ratio is 4:3 on crop sensor camera's.
