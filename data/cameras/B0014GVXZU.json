If you order two to be used as wireless and you hook them up to the same DVR and find they both relay images on ONE channel only, then the second camera is useless!  You must have one on channel 1 and one on channel 2 if you want simultaneous viewing of both cameras.Phoned up the manufacturer- and was told I could change the channel inside the camera - so we tried.  As we disassembled layer after layer of tiny screws and computer boards, and lenses, we got as far as we could and NEVER found any place to change the channel option.As wireless cameras near a wifi hotspot and wireless PC's we get very very poor reception - and can not use the motion detection at all on our DVR.My suggestion is to get the Maxi Day/Night (not the maxi brite) WIRED camera and install the wiring and not waste your time with this one.The Maxi Day/Night (CCD) gives me almost daylight quality (in b/w after dark) well after the Maxi Brite (CMOS) goes almost too dark to view with any real clarity.If you don't have wifi or wireless interference, this camera works MUCH better than most prepackaged wireless CMOS cameras like Eyeseeall and QSee, of which I have both to compare.  They go quite black while the Swann can still make out shapes.Luckily I have an 8-channel DVR, so I'll put the lesser cameras to use somewhere around the house and buy a few more WIRED CCD Maxi Day/Night Swanns for outside where I need the most protection.", "Date": "November 11, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$129.99", "Features": "380 TV Lines for high image resolution\nBNC extension cable with adapter for easy connection to your TV, VCR, quad processor or DVR\n25ft (8m) infra-red night vision\nSturdy anti-corrosive & weather resistant case for use outdoors\nDual transmission means you always get the best picture for your surveillance needs", "Name": "Swann SW231-WMX Maxi-Brite Dual-Mode Wireless / Wired Security Camera Night Vision 30ft/9m", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vlj9UgnQL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0014GVXZU"}}
