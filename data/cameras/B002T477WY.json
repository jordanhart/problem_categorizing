It's pretty intuitive and very close in operation to the Nikon camera I used to have.  The pictures all seem to come out well and I really like the 2.7\" screen.  Tried to install the software and ALAS no can do.  It only works on PC's ....basically Windows software.I've got a MAC so there is no support.  It works ok since I have a printer that allows me to pull the SD card and download the photos thru that but it would be nice to be able use the editing software that is available on the CD.Maybe sometime soon Samsung will see fit to provide software for the MAC, so in the meantime unless you have a PC I'd buy another camera.", "Date": "February 2, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Supplied Accessories - Rechargeable battery and AC power adapter, audio/video and USB cables, wrist strap, software CD-ROM\n12.2-megapixel effective recording\n3X optical zoom (5X digital/15X total zoom)\n35mm equivalent focal length - 35-105mm\n2.7 LCD screen", "Name": "Samsung TL90 12.2 Megapixel Digital Camera - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fkPRPooML._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002T477WY"}}
