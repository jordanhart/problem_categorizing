After some minor initial bumps, I am very satisfied.  When first received, the camera had a defective video cable.  It took a while for me to figure out the problem, but once done, SVAT customer service was very responsive and sent a replacement cable immediately.  The only significant negative comments that I have are that the CVP800 does not include or offer as an optional accessory a 12VDC plug-in car power supply; also the instruction manual is not very helpful in several areas.  On the positive side, the CVP800 is extremely small (easily fits into a shirt pocket), light weight and consumes very little power (under 1.5 watt).  It has a powerful feature not found on other similar mini-portable units that I evaluated, specifically, the ability to loop record, i.e., continuously record, writing over the oldest data when it reaches the capacity of the SD card.  This allows the unit to record 24 hours a day forever without any attention whatsoever.  If an event happens that you are aware of and want to review and save, simply stop the recorder and selectively play back the last minutes/hours recorded, and if you want to, download the data onto your computer to save it or simply pull the SD card with the recorded data, and insert a new one in the CVP800.  Overall, I have found this unit to be well designed - user friendly, easy to understand, and highly flexible in both recording and playing back.  The only reason I gave the CVP800 a 4-star rating (rather than 5-stars) is the absence of an out-of-the-box way to power the unit in a car other than depending on the internal AA batteries.", "Date": "September 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Using it in my car for 1+ year...flawless", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R3CFJCJOYRXIWL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There's no other DVR of it's type that I could find.

Saved my hide...", "Author": "E. Campbell", "ReviewID": "R26DFBEZAOF7L6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned two of these for 3 years - one in each car.  They loop-record anytime the car is in motion.  I installed a GPS-overlay box between my forward-facing camera (mounted on my rear-view mirror) and the DVR.  This imprints my speed on the video.  The insurance this provides against he-said she-said accidents, inaccurate laser guns (check out my youtube video), or rogue police who say one thing on the side of the road, and another in court - is priceless.All co-workers have these installed after seeing how it reveals how 'unimpeachable, trustworthy, and honest' police officer testimony is anything but...I don't go looking for trouble.  It finds me.  When it does, it's great to have an unbiased witness ready to come to my defense.Note: If your state is a two-party consent state, you'll need to warn anyone within audio recording distance that they're being recorded.  Otherwise, at best it's inadmissible, or at worst, you could be charged with felony wire-tap offenses.  I solved this problem by applying small (3\" x 1\") red warning labels in the corner of all roll-down windows.  They look like alarm stickers, but state \"Notice: Any conversations inside and within 6' of this vehicle may be recorded\".I would have given it 5 stars, but I have two annoyances:1) The A/V in/out jacks are nothing more than a 4-contact 3.5mm stereo jack.  In humid environments the internal contacts become 'dirty' causing flicker in the video if the cables are bumped.2) The video is actually split into multiple 1 - 1.5MB asf files.  They can be spliced back together, but there is about a 2-4 frame loss at each seam.  It's barely noticeable, but it is an annoyance.  I imagine this has to be the case as the files must be completed and saved before power loss.  If the power is turned off, whatever file is being written is corrupt.  Each segment is about 4-6 seconds long.  So you lose the last few seconds of record when you turn off the car.Because of the age of mine, I do not have a firmware update option under the SD section of the menu.  I have an email into svat to see if there is a work-around.  For now, my max SD size is 4GB (non-SDHC).If you want to see videos of how this works in a car, look up my username on utube.", "Date": "December 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Be Sure to Update Firmware if SDHC Card Not Working", "Author": "Michael Morgan", "ReviewID": "R1C98MONQINDH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Superb, inexpensive and flexible recorder for a single camera.  Worked out of the box using the included 1GB SD card but would not operate at all using the 16GB SDHC card I bought at the same time.  Would not boot up or work in any way.  Went to [...]and downloaded the June 2009 firmware file.  Extracted from zip and transferred to the 1GB card.  Placed the card into the CPC800 and went into menu.  Selected SD Card and update system.  Took 2 seconds.  That cured the problem.  Now can record for dozens of hours and can loop back around once the 16GB is full without intervention.  This gives an essentially perpetual recording capability.

I've had mine for about six months and used it 4-5 times. Always use the highest video resolution at around 12 fps. Video is acceptable but the MAJOR pain is that it splits the recorded video into MULTIPLE files which have to be JOINED using a 3RD PARTY utility to make one COMPLETE video recording. All because the engineers who designed this DVR didn't want to implement streaming media codecs in the firmware. Seriously, I've got another cheap $40.00 mini-DVR that will stream the video in the form of a single .AVI file to removable media (SD card). Good news is there are free utilities that will join the multiple .AVI files this unit creates relatively quickly, just an extra step which, IMO would not be necessary if the firmware had been designed to do streaming video.Overall, good product, does what it is supposed to do, one star off for the multiple files issue.", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Mini Video Recorder", "Author": "NYC User \"Eliot\"", "ReviewID": "R31FQYJDU3U5X2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good mini video recorder....Good for hidden video or car video applications...Would not recommend for long term recording as it wont replace a standard DVR in search and function options.

Spider is now gone.  Also be sure and prune your trees, even though you can set the camera to ignore certain spaces, it can be tedious going through footage if a wind storm has your evergreens blowing around.Seven months of use and no regrets.
