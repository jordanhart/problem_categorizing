Wilkins", "ReviewID": "R10G78ZQ2BWI8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this Canon on a whim, earlier today at Best Buy.  I have been tinkering with it for the majority of the evening.  My previous SD300 is still working like a champ, however I have been considering a video camera for some time...after some peering at the video camera counter I wandered over to the point and shoot table... what initially drew me in to the SD780IS was its appearance on the display stand.  The sleek matte-black body is very eye-pleasing...then I looked at the specs. and realized that it shoots video in HD! (1280x720) Then all the other attributes made me realize that it was time to update my \"everywhere, anytime\" camera.  I proceeded to check out some of the other Canon SD cameras.  The SD960 became the other candidate...it has a little more glass(4x)zoom, over the SD780's (3x)zoom.  The SD960 has an appealing f2.8 apeture over the SD780's f3.2.  The SD960's screen is more tailored for the HD video capture as it has a 16:9 ratio LCD panel. (Kinda nice for instant viewing ON THE CAMERA)  After some thought I went with the SD780 for these reasons:1.  The HD video capability is awesome and comparible with the SD960.  It has a HDMI jack.  The traditional 4:3 screen does not bother me, because the video is ultimately going to be viewed on a HD TV.(There will be an upper and lower bar on 16:9 playback through the SD780's LCD).2.The weaker 3x zoom is not a big deal as this camera is for general shooting(out w/ freinds, bars, random afternoon at the beach, mountain biking, etc.)and with this camera EASLIY fitting in my jeans pocket or camelbak, the portability is what gives me the opportunity to document those moments, that would otherwise be missed.  The SD960 is a little bulkier(but still small).  I do also shoot with a Canon 40D, accompanied with L optics, but the weight and bulkiness do not lend to certain shooting circumstances. (as mentined above)3.  The user interface on the SD780IS is like most (if not all?) preceeding SD cameras.  While there is not much control in the way of shooting settings, feature buttons like flash override, AE lock, AF lock, and exposure compensation are present on the camera body. The SD960IS has two buttons and a jog wheel, which lend to swims in the menu.  I'm sure the new interface on the 960 is intuitive, but I liked the 780 due to its similarity to my old SD300.  I am very happy with the results produced thus far with the SD780IS.  The HD video is excellant, however it should be known that once recording you can only zoom digitally.  Low light cabilities and sound in video mode are excellent.  The stills I have taken look great.  Also, to the budget-minded who are upgrading from older digital point-and-shoots, a class 4 minimum 4GB or 8GB SDHC card would be well suited due to the demanding memory of the 12.1 million pixels, and HD video.  Also, most old card readers will not process the the SDHC cards so you may have to purchase a new card reader as well.  I have to mention it again...the small size of the Canon SD780IS is mind-blowing...and the functionality actually mirrors its beauty.", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Revolutionary!

It weighs a little over 4 ounces. The size of the camera is astonishing. It is smaller than my iPhone 3G and my wallet. I love the new 720p video recording HD feature on the 2009 Canon P+S line. The image stabilization for video/image stills is a winner. The clips are sharper and clearer than the clips from the Creative Vado HD and the Flip Video MinoHD.PLAYBACK ON COMPUTERSFor video playback without choppiness on the computer, you need to have at least a Core 2 Duo 1.66 GHz or higher processor on Windows (Vista/XP SP2/XP SP 3) or Core Duo 1.66 GHz or higher processor on Mac OS X (v10.4-v10.5)MEMORY CARDYou should get at least 8GB Sandisk Extreme III SDHC (Class 6 or higher) memory card for the camera. 4000x3000 resolution images can quickly fill up your 2/4GB SD memory card.CONCLUSION+ Quick Continuous Snapshots+ 720p HD Video Recording with Image Stabilization+ Lightning Quick Startup+ Ultra-Compact Point & Shoot Camera (Thin + Light Combo)+ Beautiful Design+ Great for Beginners (Very Easy To Use)+ Bright LCD Screen+ DIGIC IV Technology+ Blink Detection+ Can Edit Video Clips on the go+ Scene Detection Mode works Flawlessly- No Optical Zoom in Video Mode while Recording (You can Digitally Zoom)- Monotone Sound in Video Mode- Only 3x Optical Zoom for image stills- View Finder is Useless- Little Noisy/Grainy when Using Higher Than ISO400 but AcceptableSCORE/VERDICT09/10: Recommended", "Date": "March 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing Things Sometimes Come In Tiny Packages", "Author": "George D. Gates", "ReviewID": "R19IG8JOQCCKWZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After researching ultra-compact cameras for 2 weeks, I had narrowed down my choices to this camera, the Canon SD880 IS and a couple of models from other manufacturers (though I knew in the end I'd choose a Canon).  As with most electronic purchases I make, it was an agonizing process.  Every camera had a feature that I wanted, yet none of them had everything that I wanted.  I would have liked a bit more zoom, and other cameras have wider lenses.  In the end, the three features that won me over were the amazingly small size, the ability to capture HD video at a resolution of 720p, and the HDMI out.As for the performance, I couldn't be happier.  Many of the reviews I read before purchasing mentioned a high amount of noise, but in my experience it only occurs at higher ISO's, is not very noticeable, and seems to be in line with other compact cameras that I've used, no more, no less.  I would NOT let this be a determining factor if I were considering this camera.This is my first camera with image stabilization and it's works very well.  On a recent trip I took over 500 pictures (and filled up less than 1/4th of my 8-gig card at the highest resolution), and not one of them ended up blurry.  The AUTO feature has also proven to be much better than I had anticipated: it changes between 18 settings automatically, such as macro, bright sunshine, etc., and so far, it's been right on the money.  Another complaint that I've read is that viewfinder is useless.  While it is quite tiny, I have actually used it, and I find it to be quite serviceable.  At some point, a camera gets so small that it's difficult to squeeze everything onto its surface area.  Kudos to Canon for even including the optical viewfinder at all.My complaints are few, and none would be a dealbreaker for me.  The small size and smooth, symmetrical shape sometimes make it hard to tell which side I am holding onto when I take it out of my pocket.  When attempting to push the power button, I will often realize I am pushing on the bottom of the camera.  I have to actually look at it to tell what I am doing.  Also, as stated previously, the HD video takes a pretty beefy CPU to play back smoothly.  My PC is 4 years old and has a hard time keeping up.  The easy solution to this is to play back directly to the monitor/TV with an HDMI cable.  It seemed improbable to me that a video made with a camera this small would look good on a 55\" HD television.  I was stunned at how sharp it looked.The bottom line is that anybody looking for an ultra-compact camera is going to be extremely satisfied with this one.  It doesn't take the pictures that a digital SLR is going to, nor does it have the same features.  But anybody looking at this camera realizes that already.  I went to an arts festival last weekend and was AMAZED at how many people are lugging around DSLR's these days.  It seemed like every other person had one.  When looking at performance vs. convenience and portability, I'll take the SD780 any day.", "Date": "May 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "With such great power comes great resp- ..video?", "Author": "Kent T. Hambrock", "ReviewID": "RBKX677EAEH9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As many have already left HUGE reviews on this camera I will try to be quick about it, but I did have to review this camera. This camera is great. When I say that I mean it. I work for a camera store and everyday I'm reviewing cameras to people's faces and when this one came out I took one look at it and the features and told my boss \"Oh yeah, we'll be out by tomorrow\" and we were. It sells FAST. Why? Because it's a GREAT camera.  The form factor can't truly be captured in a picture, you have to feel this thing in your hand to know what everyone's talking about. 9 out of 10 people I show the camera to decide to buy once they've held it. It's small, it's REALLY small. It's just a sexy form. The 2.5 isn't screen isn't because they wanted to be cheap, it's because they couldn't put a bigger screen on there without making the camera a good deal bigger. Same for the 3x zoom.  The Digic IV processor and iSAPS technology means this camera is fast and accurate. It's constantly focusing and letting you know what it thinks you want to take a picture of. It's facial recognition is so fast and accurate, it can track someone running quickly across the screen with a box around their face the whole time. And it picks up faces on magazines, ads, anything that has a human face on it. The iSAPS is constantly changing the mode to better suit what you're shooting and it'll show you the mode you're in while it's doing it(upper left hand corner of the screen).  The 720p high-def video is the one that seals the deal. You know it's fast. You know it's accurate. You know it's easy. But the video, always catches you of guard. \"Wait you mean to tell me this camera smaller then my blackberry curve can take high-def video as well as pictures??\" Oh it can do more then that. Canon always has a few things thrown into video mode for the fun of it, like color Accent, as in taking away all but one color. Allowing your friend in the red shirt to be the REAL center of attention. And seeing that on the big screen only makes the camera more interesting.  And I even sold myself on buying the camera, with it's sleekness, speed, accuracy, and high-def I just couldn't resist. I'm not telling you to get the camera, but if you do, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "More Than Expected!! Superb Photos!", "Author": "H. Mera", "ReviewID": "R1Z5KWDYOPPK2S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PROS: Easy to use, Simple controls/menu, Nice features/settings, Bright LCD, Excellent image quality, Lightweight/Portable, compact volumeCONS: Poor Low-Light Performance, some noise in low light, tiny viewfinder, mini-HDMI to HDMI cable not included, SD/SDHC storage card not includedAmazon has the best price at under 250 bucks. Most sites are charging full retail since this camera is so popular.High Definition video is very good at 720p. This will not replace a full size camera or the 5D Mark II for video quality. But, it is a lot better than most including the original Flip video camera.An HDMI cable IS NOT INCLUDED with the camera. You will need it to watch HD video directly from the camera on an HDTV. I bought a 3 ft miniHDMI-to-HDMI cable online from Monoprice for 8 bucks including USPS first class shipping. They have quality cables for the lowest price on the Monoprice site.UPDATE: I am very happy with the mini-HDMI to HDMI cables.  They were so inexpensive that I bought 2 of these at 3ft long: one for the iMac, the other is for my travel bag.  I bought a 6ft mini-HDMI to HDMI cable for the HDTV in the first floor family room. I should have gotten a longer cable since you have to control the video start/stop/next buttons on the camera. You have to get up often to start the next movie clip. I also bought a small 1x3/4inch miniHDMI to HDMI adapter to carry everywhere I take the camera which is everywhere!UPDATE:  The small cover that protects the miniHDMI and USB ports feels a little flimsy. The hinge stretches. I have to force it slightly beyond my comfort to insert cables. I can see this covering breaking off with a lot of use.An SD storage card IS NOT INCLUDED. They are available at low cost, under 15 bucks, on the net. Check the Dealnews site for the latest sales. I used a 4GB SD high capacity (SDHC) card which will hold about 30mins of video.Some complain 2.5inch is too small for the LCD. There is no place to put a larger 3inch LCD on this camera without making it a touch screen like the iPhone or increasing the camera size. Plus, 2.5 inch is common on a lot of cameras. I have no problems with it.TINY VIEW FINDER: It was hard peering through the small hole. I mainly use the LCD screen about 95% of the time. So, NOT A PROBLEM.Got this camera to try out the 720p HD, face/blink detection and other features. They all worked great.I was surprised by the small size since I only saw this camera online and never tried it out at a store. It is slightly smaller than my average size business card and about as thin as a new deck of playing cards. I'm female, but, I never bought an ELPH-size Canon camera because they seemed too small. I was concerned I would not be able to comfortably operate the buttons or it would slip out of my hands. I don't have that fear with the SD780. The brushed metal finish provides some friction. The buttons are placed well. Also, the wrist strap is always available as protection against dropping the camera.SMART AUTO feature is great! I use it often to take closeup (macro) shots or when I don't have time to adjust the settings. I hold the camera about 4 inches from an object and the camera self adjusts the settings. It amazing to watch it work. I partially press the shutter button to see where the camera is focused and move it to focus on my area of interest. The camera selects of the pre-programmed 18 modes to find the one that creates the best image.As many stated, the images are superb thanks to the 12.1 mega pixel resolution, Digic 4, and the image stabilizer (IS) function. You should not live without IS unless you are into the artsy blurry pictures. It takes great pictures of kids who don't sit still. Great if you don't have steady hands. Images are crisp, clear and can be easily seen in the beautiful 2.5inch LCD.I noticed the noise in some of the photos. Did not have too much problems with it.The 3X optical is fine. Best for the photographer to move in or out to zoom/out on the subject matter and not worry about the camera lens zoom when just taking photos. Zooming during filming would be better. Hopefully, Canon adds this feature to future powershot ELPH models.Overall, a great camera that is thin enough to hide in a small purse or pocket yet still deliver superb photos for it's size!(I have owned 7 Canon cameras including 5 digital cameras. I have used this camera for about 1 week.)", "Date": "May 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera for a compact in this price range.", "Author": "Kyle B. Kennedy \"D-OveRMinD\"", "ReviewID": "R3LMZ7IYGBMLY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a higher end Canon Rebel DSLR with some pretty good glass and used it this past week at Disney world. While you can't beat the quality of pictures from a DSLR in low light and on fast moving targets (not to mention all other times), it became a HUGE pain to carry around the park and to take on and off getting on rides.So I read the reviews and found that the best carry-around camera was the Panasonic Lumix ZS3 (TZ7 in other parts of the world). Unfortunately, no one around here carries that camera, and online the prices are still in the $400+ range. So I decided to wade through the middle market and came across this camera, the Canon Powershot SD780 IS (IXUS 100 IS in other parts of the world).The various Sony's looked good as well, I just hate the memory sticks they use. I always like keeping everything the same, and since my Canon Rebel uses SDHC, I decided to go with a cam that used that as well.It takes amazing pictures when there is plenty of light, such as outside or indoors with ambient lighting. Clouds look beautiful and are not blown out. Color is very vivid, like all Canon shots. The video quality is definately HD 720p quality and looks nice at a steady 30 frames per second. However, the minimum f-stop even at full wide is 3.5 and creeps into the 6's with the zoom racked out. With that said, low light situations create such a grainy picture as to be unusable by my standards. The shadow areas are horrible and muddy. And the video exhibits this same nastiness.I was able to figure out all camera features on my own without reading the manual at all, but if you want to, there is a VERY detailed manual that goes step by step with pictures of how to work the cam.If you want to take over in full manual mode, they give you access to pretty much all the settings in one simple menu. Shoot in Program AE, change ISO, change white balance, change tone, self timers, continuous shooting, focus lock, exposure compensation, metering mode, AF frame mode and focal point, Servo AF, etc.One of the best features of the camera (and I sugest you try all the cams out in the store to see what I mean) is how FAST it auto focuses and takes a picture. Right from power up, I can take a pic in under 2 seconds. On top of that, the shutter lag is about .02 seconds. You hit the button, the picture takes right then. AF on almost ALL other cameras I picked up had to hunt for the focus for several seconds, and some never gained focus at all, while others kept trying to refocus after acquiring a lock. This camera, even in up close macro mode, gained a solid focus lock in under a second and stayed there.And macro mode is wonderful! You can be just over an inch from your subject and take some of the greatest, full focused images. Auto mode will sense how close you are and automatically change to macro mode.You also have the ability to create folders on your memory card right from the camera. Very useful if you are hitting multiple camera ops in a day and would like to keep them all separate. All the menus are well laid out, but once you set up for your shoot, most of the buttons you will be using will be on the camera body. And again, as much as I like to set everything myself in full manual mode, I found that full auto is smarter than me most of the time. I guess the camera is calibrated to know what the best settings for its lens are. Reviewing images, zooming in on them to check details, deleting, tagging, watching videos, etc are all very easy. And videos are in the standard .MOV format making them easy to edit and stitch on a PC or a Mac.I went ahead and picked up the Canon leather belt pouch as well for this cam as it keeps it on your side at the ready, looks professional, and is no bigger than a phone holster.One additional note on why I picked this cam...it has cool accessories!Just to name a few:HDMI out to TV with standard Mini-HDMI to full HDMI.Waterproof/dustproof case that you can take to 140ft underwater!High power external remote flash.All available on Amazon!Another hint...you can find additional rechargeable lithium batteries for as little as $2 here on Amazon. The Canon brand goes for almost $50 and the others last just as long.All in all, it was a good purchase and will be coming with me on all camera excursions and trips. It may very well be the camera that \"gets the shot\" that my big DSLR doesn't because of it always being at my hip and ready to shoot in a couple of seconds.", "Date": "August 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Noisy, but good", "Author": "Adam Dachis \"adachis\"", "ReviewID": "R3EDV4TFBAJ03H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you want this little new camera from Canon it's probably due to it's attractive body and small size, something Canon has done well in the past and managed to improve upon in the SD780 IS.  If those two things are topping your list, don't bother reading this review.  You've succeeded in finding a tiny, attractive little camera that can go just about anywhere.  If quality and features also matter, it's more of a mixed bag.  As usual, when you make a camera this small, the form factor means sacrifices in more practical areas.  Nonetheless, Canon does a nice job all-around in giving you an excellent value despite the shortcomings inherent in pocket photographic devices.For owners of small pocket cameras, it should come as no surprise that noise is the number one problem with this device.  With a 12MP sensor, it's no wonder there's so much noise in every photo you take.  Outdoors, indoors, pitch black, whatever: it doesn't matter.  You will see noise no matter how well-lit your scene is, whether there are dark areas or not.  This is a huge drawback if you're printing large photos.  If you're like most people and only go beyond 4x6 or 5x7 for that occasional photo that warrants an 8x10, you don't have much to worry about.  Though cramming 12MP into a tiny little sensor, like the one used in the SD780 IS, is certainly a cause of the high levels of noise, the resolution it provides makes the noise imperceptible when printing small photographs.  You may notice it in an 8x10 photo taken at night, but for your smaller prints you should get by just fine.Where noise is a bigger problem is in the video mode.  Since the introduction of their 5D Mark II DSLR, Canon's begun to embrace high-definition video across their photographic line.  Though few cameras in Canon's arsenal can capture HD video at this time, I believe by the end of 2009 it should be more the norm than the exception.  While the SD780 IS doesn't capture 1080p video like the 5D Mark II, or it's (much) bigger brother the SX1S IS, 720p is quite a feat for a camera this small.  It's comparable in size to the Flip Mino HD and only costs about $50 more (if you're comparing by suggested retail pricing).  Though not as straightforward and simple as the Flip, by virtue of being a still camera first and a video device second, if you're looking for a device that does both and are willing to pay a little extra you've found it.  The video quality in the Canon SD780 IS is more uniformly sharp (in daylight or indoors), though the Flip Mino HD tends to pick up slightly more detail in the distance (in daylight, not indoors).  The SD780 IS gives you selective focus and stabilization.  While you may not care for selective focus, the image stabilization offered in the SD780 IS is very nice to have when taking video clips.  The image stabilizer allows for nice, smooth pans that are not offset by the \"jello effect\" you get with CMOS sensors.  The Flip uses a CMOS and has that issue.  The SD780 IS uses a CCD and does not.  The SD780 also offers H.264 encoding at an average bit rate of about 24Mbps.  For H.264 720p video, this is a very high bit rate from a device.  Nonetheless, the files aren't too big.  If you've got a 16GB SDHC card you'll get about an hour and a half of video.  Where the Flip does a better job, however, is in noise.Though the Flip isn't exactly the best device in low light, it still manages pretty well for a tiny little camera.  The SD780 IS looks noisy in every situation.  While the high megapixel rating keeps the noise harder to see in a photo, when you're dealing with 720p video the noise is very apparent.  You can see it in perfect daylight, though it's not that bothersome, and you can really see it indoors regardless of the lighting.  This is a noisy camera.  Though it's forgivable in the photographs, in most cases, it really hurts the video mode.  Given the limitations of the tiny hardware and the unfortunate megapixel race, noise reduction would've been nice.  Nonetheless, if you're looking for an incredibly tiny device that records HD video, the SD780 IS should by high on your list by virtue of its stabilization.Being that this is a primarily a still camera and not a video device, there are a lot of positives to look at.  Let's start on the outside and work our way in.  Canon's clearly put a lot of thought into the form factor.  Regardless of what color you get, I think most will agree that this is a very attractive device.  It's compact and light, so taking it with you will seem about the same as not taking it with you: you will often forget you have it.  On one hand, that's very nice.  On the other, make sure you don't lose it.  Though it's not the smallest camera you can buy, it feels a lot smaller than it is.  This could be an issue for some people.  I've owned and/or reviewed a large number of consumer imaging devices and I've never run into the problems that some seem to have with button size.  I've used a Sony camera that's a bit smaller than this one and had no issues, whatsoever, with accidental presses.  The SD780 IS is the first device I've owned where I often make these mistakes.  If you have big fingers, you will probably find this device extremely frustrating.  For me, the problem is primarily with what I'll call the function wheel.  Kind of like an iPod, in the center is a Function/Set button surrounded by a wheel of four other options.  Though this is not a new interface for Canon, it's awfully small on the SD 780 and it's very easy to mistakenly push the wrong button on the wheel (or the center button).  Personally, I don't find myself running into this problem too often because I'm not frequently changing settings.  Nonetheless, it's something you should consider if you've had trouble with accidental button pushes in the past.The other switches, however, are quite easy to deal with.  The other four buttons on the back panel have quite a bit of space around them, even when not considering how small this camera is, and pushing them is no trouble at all.  One is a switch that goes from automatic photo mode to custom photo mode to video mode.  Though I've come to prefer separate buttons for starting a video and taking a photo, much like Sanyo does with their line of convergence cameras (which they're now calling \"dual cameras\"), this switch works well in the sense that it keeps you in the mode and saves you from remembering which button to push when you want something.  More importantly, switching modes is about as fast as you could ask for.  Though it's not my preferred way to switch modes (because I prefer the devices to seem like there's no switch at all), it doesn't really end up being a problem.Lastly, there are two buttons on the top of the camera.  One is for the shutter and the other is the power button.  If you have large fingers, good luck pushing the power button.  It's tiny and it isn't raised at all.  I consider my fingers normal-sized and have no difficulty pushing the button but if you're concerned, go try the camera in a store before you buy it.  As for the shutter, that's no problem at all.  You half-depress to focus and press fully to take the photo, like you would with pretty much any digital camera on the market.  There is also a zoom ring around the shutter button which has a tiny little edge to it for your finger to flick.  It works quite well, despite being as tiny as it is.  For the most part, the camera is very easy to control despite its size.  Though you may have difficulty when changing settings, when it comes to general operation (aside from turning it on and off) you shouldn't run into issues.My two favorite parts of the SD780 IS body are its large screen and port access.  The screen is incredibly bright and clear, even at half brightness (which is where it starts out of the box and probably where you want to leave it), and is well protected by a glass covering.  Smudging is easy to clean but be careful of scratches.  The refresh rate of the screen is also excellent.  Color accuracy is surprisingly good and realistic, assuming you're not using the \"my colors\" feature.  I've come to expect less from Canon's devices (especially in the white balancing department) and I was pleasantly surprised.  While that isn't entirely the display's job, what I see on the screen is what I see in reality.  No complaints.  If you prefer shooting from the viewfinder, which is perfectly reasonable, you will definitely be disappointed.  The option is nice, of course, but it's so incredibly tiny that it seems more for show than for any actual use.  I appreciate Canon's inclusion, but I can pretty much guarantee it will never be used for any practical purpose.  My other favorite part is the port access, because it's exactly how I like it.  In the top left corner (if you're looking at the back of the camera), you pull off this little piece of plastic to reveal a mini HDMI port and a mini USB port.  There's no proprietary connections.  It's nice to see a tiny camera not sacrifice connectivity for the sake of size.  To transfer pictures, just pull the plastic covering away and plug the camera into your computer.  The process is the same if you want to connect the camera via HDMI to your HDTV.  Canon doesn't include the necessary cable, which is a shame, but being that I've never once connected my camera to a television I'm not really bothered.  They do give you a standard definition cable, however, so you're not stranded with no options.  On the bottom of the camera there is the usual slide-off access to the battery and memory card.  Canon really crammed them both in there, but in a way that's impressive and not cumbersome.  Additionally, they managed a tripod head mount on the bottom as well, and you can pull away a little rubber covering to reveal a hole for the tripod head's stabilizer (the little piece that doesn't screw in but holds the camera in place on the head).Overall, the camera body has an excellent design.  It's not only attractive but functional.  The only drawback is the possibility of accidental button pushes, but that sort of comes with the territory.What about the camera's features?  We've already discussed video mode, which is excellent aside from the noise issues.  The still camera features and controls are quite good all around, with only a few silly omissions.  Let's start with the menu system.  It's very simple.  You press the menu button and you have two columns.  One is the very simple camera options column, only giving you four choices, and the other is the function column giving you much more to do.  In the camera options, you can turn certain functionalities on or off.  Despite the paltry zoom on this device, which is to be expected due to its size, I'd recommend turning off digital zoom.  It's on by default.  Why it is even included in cameras is something I've never quite understood.  As for the functions menu, you have a number of basic functions (display brightness, card formatting, etc.) but also some superfluous functions like changing the sound effects and the camera's startup image.  You don't get many choices, and the dog bark shutter sound is absent from this device (which I always loved), but you get choices nonetheless.  If you don't want sound effects at all, there is a mute feature.  You should note, however, that this camera makes noise on startup nonetheless.  The body is a little noisy on its own.  The image stabilizer also sounds like a fan is running.  I haven't heard the microphone pick up this noise in video mode, but if operation noise is a problem for you for whatever reason you can minimize it by turning off image stabilization.  That said, aside from getting a couple of extra pictures out of your battery life, I can't imagine why you'd ever want to turn it off.Canon's autofocus has lagged behind Nikon's in the DSLR market, in my opinion, but in their consumer devices I've been pretty pleased with how well it works.  Autofocus is very fast and, in my experience so far, very accurate.  The only problem I've consistently run into is the minimum focal distance in normal mode.  Turning on macro mode solves the problem, and seems to be the most versatile mode (as it has no problem, unlike some consumer cameras, focusing far off as well).  The unfortunate issue with macro focus is that it resets every time you switch modes or turn the camera off.  If you want it on, you need to set it every single time.  It would be nice to either be able to change the default or for the camera to automatically switch to macro when it can't manage to focus due to its proximity to the subject.The flash does a pretty good job for being so tiny.  Even from far away, it does well.  Oddly enough, close subjects were not as blown out as I'd expected.  Often times the photos looked surprisingly natural for a flash.  Nonetheless, since you're getting image noise regardless, I recommend shooting with higher ISOs if you have a reasonable amount of light in the room.  It still tends to look more natural, especially after a little color correction.Exposure controls and the self-timer meet expectations.  There's not a lot of room for innovation with these features, but you can adjust what I can only assume is the gain before taking a photo.  Perhaps you're adjusting shutter speed, though I'm not sure.  You can also set a self-timer for 2 or 10 seconds.  Actually being able to choose the time would be a nice step up, but I don't think many have complained about the options given.  They work just fine.The SD780 IS also includes many superfluous but fun features common to Canon's consumer line.  My Colors is one of them.  They give you so many different color modes (including positive film, monotone and sepia) I don't know why you'd want to create your own, but you do have that option.  You can also shoot in black and white with a color accent, if you're trying to create the feel of Schindler's List in your family photos (hopefully that includes no one), or just swap colors for whatever reason you'd want to do that.Playback mode is excellent.  It's very easy to zoom in and out on your photos and navigate through them.  You can even display a histogram and EXIF data while looking at the photo, which is pretty excessive but cool for a consumer device.  Video playback provides a wealth of control, which even includes in-camera editing.  This isn't terribly new to Canon's devices but it's still nice.  Personally, I'd rather edit outside of the camera but if you need space on your card and don't have a spare it might be a good way to solve that issue (assuming you have parts of your videos that you want to remove).As far as silly omissions go, when selecting an image size you can get the normal 4:3 or 16:9 (likely a result of the video mode).  Where's the 3:2 option?  Digital cameras have pioneered the 4:3 format, which, personally, I do not like.  When printing a 4x6 photo I'd prefer to avoid cropping.  Both 4:3 and 16:9 require cropping, which is unfortunate.  It seems ridiculous to not offer 3:2 shooting, but then again that's not the norm with these devices.  I think that's unfortunate.  As I've mentioned previously, the lack of an HDMI cable and noise reduction is also too bad.  The HDMI is understandable as this camera is pretty inexpensive (and you'd never know that by looking at it), but noise reduction is sorely missed.  It's no replacement for an actual lack of noise, but a little bit would go a long way with this device.The battery life is surprisingly good.  Perhaps I feel that way because I haven't used a camera this small in a long time, but being that it can make it through the day given all the crap I put it through with room to spare, I'm impressed.  The camera also comes with a separate charger, which is great if you want to pick up a spare battery.  It's also very easy for travel.  Though I always prefer the option, at least, to charge via USB (in case I forget the charger or don't want to bother bringing it with me), the provided charger is very compact and makes charging the battery an easy thing to do.  The only downside is that you constantly have to remove the battery from the camera, but they make that access easy enough (as described earlier).Overall, there's a lot to like about the Canon SD780 IS.  The noise issue is the biggest drawback, but educated buyers should know to expect this when purchasing a pocket device.  Everything else is mostly trivial.  Though the noise issues are a major drawback, especially if you're interested in the mostly great HD video mode, this is a great little camera and well worth the price thanks to the HD video mode.In summary...+ Attractive, tiny size and solid build+ Surprisingly good battery life+ Big, bright, color-accurate display+ Menu system and on-screen interface is attractive and easy to use+ Forgetting the noise issues, video mode is very good providing 720p video in H.264 with a high bit rate (average of 24Mbps)+ Easy access to ports and easy to transfer photos or display them on your (HD)TV+ The flash is surprisingly effective without being excessively bright+ Inexpensive for what you get= Very high resolution photos, though this comes at a cost (6 to 8 MP seems like a more logical choice)= Image stabilization is excellent considering the size, but isn't what you get with a larger device= Has a viewfinder, though it's pretty much useless= Many superfluous but fun features, mainly color-related- Physical buttons are often too small and accidental pushes are commonplace- Images and video are extremely noisy, no matter the lighting conditions", "Date": "March 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Professional photographer view of this camera", "Author": "Marybeth", "ReviewID": "R2C9XJV6KPG6IQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a professional photographer that owns the Nikon D300 and Nikon D80 slr cameras for professional business.

In reading some of the reviews, I think that this camera is getting either too good a review or definitely too bad. People: this is a small pocket size point and shoot camera that has up to ISO3200, 12.1 megapixels and video capability all rolled into a product that can be bought for $200 on sale and taken ANYWHERE with ease.  It is ONLY a point and shoot and NOT an SLR so therefore, does NOT take phenominal pictures that a $5000 SLR camera with expensive lenses would.  It is ONLY a point and shoot camera so therefore when you HAVE noise up in the 1600 Iso range or in the video camera, having purchased this for this kind of money without expensive lenses should not come as a surprise even compared to all the other Camera point and shoots and its competitors.My point here after owning this for 2 days but having owned a previous Canon point and shoot for 5 years before the Nikon slrs?  Canon makes a PHENOMINAL product that does what its supposed to do in this tiny little portable package.  If you want to make money off your photos?  If you want to have pristine quality...go get an SLR and plunk down $1500 or more dollars on ALL the lenses and bodies and education that will make that happen.  If you want a convenient cute little camera that gets the job done VERY WELL...THIS is well worth the money.

I've been playing with all the recent point and shoot camcorders such as the Kodak Zi6 and the Creative Vado HD. I also have the not-yet-released-in-the-US Canon SX1 which does full 1080p HD video. I have also tried the Sony T500.The first thing you'll notice is how small this camera is. To date, its the smallest Canon camera yet almost to the point that its difficult to handle. I'd call it Ultra-compact and this thing can fit anywhere. The button are more flush than any other Canon which makes button finding and feeling a bit cumbersome.I wasn't expecting much from this camera in terms of performance but it blows all other point and shoot camcorders out of the water. The colors are much more accurate and the video overall is much smoother. Part of this due to the image stabilization feature. The toy cameras do not have this feature which is a huge necessity for something so small and light. It handles low-light situations better as well. Search SD780 on youtube for samples. Make sure you click the HD button.The photos are secondary to me but they can be good in the manual mode. Using it with higher ISO setting will introduce noise. Then again, these photos are much better than the point and shoot camcorders. These are actually usable.So with the point and shoot camcorders around the $200 mark (MinoHD, VAdoHD, Zi6), for $80 more (SD780) you get something that is much better overall.+ Made in Japan and much better build quality than the toy camcorders+ Removable SD storage card+ Removable battery (uses the common NB-4L)+ Image stabilization+ Usable stills+ Canon optics+ Ultra compact (2/3 the size of a MinoHD)+ Easy to use .MOV files+ Stealth Black colorThe only drawbacks I can think of are:- Cannot use optical zoom during recording (let's hope this can be changed via firmware upgrade)- Photos can be noisy and grainy at times- Mono sound recordings", "Date": "March 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "powerful little pocket machine, amazing results", "Author": "annabella", "ReviewID": "R2ZF4YN5B57W9B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "first of all, i cannot stress 2 things more:--> read the manual before starting!!--many people buy point and shoots for typical picture taking but neglect getting to know all the features, including several here that give you just enough room for manipulation that can produce magnificent results.--key thing to remember....if you see the [DISP] symbol pop up on the menu as you scroll through your different settings along the bottom of the viewfinder, PUSH \"DISPLAY\", as it opens an entire addtl menu of more options or adjustment settings! one of my friends who also owns a canon point and shoot was oblivious until just recently that he could \"stitch\" his photos or adjust colors b/c he never discovered the hidden options!--> secondly, my use of this camera once again solidifies the one piece of advice i've received from pro photographers time and time again: if you have the eye, even point and shoot cameras can produce fabulous results comparable or even better than the next guy with the fancy SLR [ie my boyfriend! :)]For the rest, i'll try to be as concise as possible, but please keep in mind that i'm just an ordinary consumer--i don't know much about electronics and/or photography, so if something i comment on seems really irrelevant and/or obvious, then sorry! :) i'm just trying to point out stuff found significant or notable in comparison to my past experiences with other point and shoots.also, I've posted an array of photos i took right after buying this camera...if anything, they should be enough evidence as to what a great product this is!

I've been a Canon point-and-shoot fan for some time. In my opinion Canon has the best optics. I have a Canon G10 for higher-end photography and although it is a compact camera, it is not quite a pocket camera. I wanted something I could easily keep in my shirt pocket all the time and the SD 780 fits the bill perfectly. I find that I shoot a lot less if I don't have a really compact camera available. The SD 780 is Canon's smallest camera to date.It's easy to use and the Canon layout is excellent. The buttons are small and it may take a day or two to get used to them, especially if you have big hands. The HD video is really great and noticeably better quality than the 640 x 480 mode of my G10. My quibbles are few:-- 3.2 maximum aperture instead of the usual 2.8-- No optical zoom in the movie mode.-- Grainy images at ISO of 400 and higher.

Now, that was the case when I purchased this little toy.  I had a Nikon D40 dSLR (one of the big cameras), and I was looking for something smaller that I could carry around everywhere.  Particularly, I needed something to take on my trip to Japan.I spent days reading reviews and testing products at stores, and finally decided on this camera.  I narrowed down my choices to Canon cameras, because although I love Nikon cameras and dSLRs, I think that when it comes down to point-and-shoot cameras (small, easy to use cameras) Canon cameras are simply the best.  I've never been disappointed by one of these.Among 10 different Canon models it was difficult to choose, but what finally made me decide on this one was the size and ability to record HD video.  I watched on YouTube some of the sample videos (which you can find just by typing the camera model) and the HD was amazing, even in such a small camera!  The resolution is great, and the picture quality simply great.  12MP of image resolution means more to love and more flexibility to crop when editing (it also means you should get an SD card with a couple of GB's)I got the camera with an 8GB card and I can take thousands of pictures at maximum resolution, or record over 45 minutes of video in one clip if I want to do so.  This camera's pictures rival my Nikon dSLR pictures, and the flexibility the camera gives you in manual mode is great.  I mostly use it in automatic modes, and it works perfect.If you are looking for a 'photographer' camera, then I'd still go for a Nikon D40 or something similar, since you can shoot in RAW format which is very valuable for heavy editing.  But if you just want to capture easily all the beautiful things around you, and videos of your family/friends or you enjoying your days, this camera is perfect for all of it.One more note, the camera feels great in my hands and it's very easy to use.  I was quite familiar with the Canon menus, so it might have been easier for me to use it, but I'm sure you can learn fast how to master this camera.Ask any questions you may have. :)", "Date": "June 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera very small and beautiful, and superb photos.", "Author": "Wendell M.

The lens is stabilized (IS) and it works well. The wide angle is necessary for interior shots and for landscapes. Stabilization can be selected as continuous, only at shooting, or off for tripod work.The LCD (2.5in) is smaller than several of Canon's SD series, but allows the presence of a bright optical view finder. I consider an optical view finder to be essential for operation in direct sunlight. Photographs are recorded as JPEG, and are magnificent at ISOs up to 200 (above an ISO of 400 noise starts to become apparent). I usually print them at 16x20in on an Epson Stylus PRO 4000. The camera will also record sound (monaural) and High Definition (HD) video (16x9) at 1280x720 pixels, 30 frames/sec as well as standard definition video. Movies are recorded in the MOV format. The program ZoomBrowser EX on the included CD contains a function to convert MOV files to the AVI format. The conversion is a bit slow taking about 10 min for a 1 min clip. The HD movies played on a 42in plasma TV are stunning. On a 16GB SDHC card, the camera will take over 5,000 photos at highest resolution, or about 90 min of HD video. The camera has a mini HDMI port, so videos and/or photos can be displayed on a HDTV through an HDMI cable (sold separately). The SD780 IS offers a large number of shooting modes. I often use the Macro mode to produce 16x20in prints of small flowers that on the final print are 4-times life-size. The camera comes with all the bells and whistles currently offered on many of the newest (and far more expensive) DSLRs. For example, the self-timer countdown can be set to start only after a new face enters the frame.

For those other occasions, I switch to the Program mode and adjust the settings from there.  I have not noticed any serious noise while taking pictures in low light.

I've done that with lots of devices, and certainly I could do so here. But my new-camera needs were fairly simple, and the bottom line is that this little gizmo fulfilled them all.My husband used to be a professional photographer, and he is still most comfortable with a camera that gives him a lot of control; he wants and needs an SLR, and he cheerfully will adjust F-stops to get a photo to look just-so. Cool; he can have a high-end camera. But I'm a typical snapshot photographer who merely wants to record her vacation photos. I don't pretend to be a good photographer; I just want to create pictures that aren't embarrassing.I want something simple enough to use without memorizing a manual, too. I like that I _can_ do more with the camera than the basics... but I especially like that I don't have to remember how to twist a lot of knobs.My needs were short and sweet: I wanted a camera small enough to carry with me that could make up for my weaknesses. (My 5-year-old Canon was too big to fit comfortably into my laptop bag, so I had to be really motivated to bring it along on a trip.) The PowerShot clearly fit the bill on the first requirement; it does literally fit into a breast pocket, so I actually have the camera with me. It's fast to turn on, too, so I can be fairly spontaneous.It's solid, so a klutz like me can drop it without worrying too much (not that I admit that I've done this already...). And - okay, this sounds dumb, but it matters - it's RED. So I can find it lurking at the bottom of my purse, otherwise known as The Black Hole From Which Nothing Emerges.Primary among my weaknesses (the photo-taking ones, let's not get too personal...) is a bad case of hand-shake. All too often, my pictures were out of focus, because I tend to move as I whack on the button. The PowerShot's image stabilization delivered admirably. I took 88 pictures on a recent trip, and the only pictures that are out-of-focus are because someone was actively waving his arms while he was talking.One extra that I appreciated -- and I would never had shopped for -- is the camera's ability to identify faces and focus on those rather than, say, the potted plant next to my subject. I can tell that the camera is doing a better job for me; certainly my first batch of photos has a higher success rate than anything I've done previously. That feature certainly has changed the way that I look through the viewfinder.I haven't used the camera for video; I have a Flip Video for that use, which is even more dead-simple than this. (Perhaps this makes me sound like a Luddite. In reality, I'm a software geek. But I don't care to be a geek about EVERYthing. I like convenience, too.)Weaknesses? Well, I do agree that the on/off button could be a problem for people with big fingers (though it's fine for me). And the place where I plug in the USB cable to connect to my iMac seems like it might be fragile. It probably is just fine; it just *looks* like I could break off that connector during a brain-dead moment.But man, I love this little camera. It's simple enough for me to use, but not so stupid that it gets in my way. That's just what I wanted -- and it might be exactly what you wanted, too.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Ok camera", "Author": "Blueflower77", "ReviewID": "R1QFPQ85KRXLL4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "To be honest, I bought this particular model pretty much based on the great reviews here on Amazon. I am not a photographer, but I own a high end DSLR and after that, I guess, maybe my point-and-shoot expectations were a little too high. I used to own a Sony point-and-shoot for many years that I loved, then got a Nikon DSLR, so this is my first time with Canon. And I am disappointed. It is my hope that I learn how to use this little camera better and get better pictures.Good things:1. Good focus - the pictures are rarely blurry.2. Very small and compact, fits into the cell phone compartment of my purse - great portability.3. Image quality for the most part is ok if you shoot under ideal conditions - not too much sunlight, not too dark, no one is moving and you hold the camera very still.4. The video quality is fantastic.Bad things:1. I find that this camera frequently over-exposes images. Whether it's daylight outside, sunlight or dusk, whether I use the flash or not, 80% of the time, at least a few spots on the camera are too bright, too white and the image looks poorly.2. \"Auto mode\" chooses the settings poorly in my opinion. There is a \"Program\" mode that allows you to select more specifically (white balance, color choice, vivid vs neutral, lighting conditions, etc), so I ended up reshooting the same thing in the \"P\" mode and got much better picture. But if you're like my husband (the primary user of this point-and-shoot), he says it's annoying to change settings all the time, so naturally he gravitates toward the \"Auto.\"3. The flash is too bright for the zoom range. Meaning, the flash is super bright and there is no point in it being so bright because it bleaches out people's faces and anything you put in the few feet range of the flash. However, if you try to shoot something far away with this flash, the zoom doesn't reach far enough to actually see the far image, so especially in low lighting you hardly see anything at all. Annoying.4. I'm a female and my fingers are pretty small. I work in healthcare, so don't have very long nails. The buttons on this camera blend into the body of the camera very well. They are also tiny buttons, so you really have to make an effort with your nail to push the buttons to get the camera to do something. But my husband (whose fingers are much bigger) finds this feature particularly painful.If given the opportunity again, I wouldn't buy this camera.", "Date": "June 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Size matters, but there's a few weakpoints", "Author": "capt.bry@n", "ReviewID": "R18PNNACWH5Z6N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my SD780IS 'digital elph' for about a month now and generally am pleased with it. It certainly won't be the last camera I buy, but should serve me well for now. The camera is smaller than my cell phone which is it's greatest feature. Unfortunately, the camera itself will get you more oooooh's and aaaahhh's than the photo's it takes. It's compact and lightweight but still has a nice big screen. It also has a standard viewfinder that is so small it's pretty much useless. The camera is also pretty stylish, albeit pretty girly. I got a better deal on the silver model. If you paid more to get the red one you are much cooler than me.Strong points - Lot's of shooting modes, quick and decent AUTO mode, allows user control of all variables if desired. Lot's of options regarding flash, self timer, etc. Image stabilization seems to work under the right circumstance, like portraits, but it's only nice to have because the small camera is hard to hold still, and it seems to increase recycle time. Continuous drive was a must for me. I think it's .8 fps without the flash, which makes it far easier to get good shots of kids, animals, and sports. Decent optical zoom. Takes really nice macro shots and allows for digital zoom macro. The video feature also takes macro. The video is some kind of HD, I don't know much about it but they do look nice full screen. The audio comes in loud and clear usually, but sometimes I think I'm hearing the camera in the video. The image viewing mode is nicely done, with more options than I'd ever need. Quickly looking through for a particular shot is no problem. Generally sturdy construction.Weak points - Probably the single most important feature has me a little disappointed. Image quality is good, but is not amazing or fantastic. Other reviews suggested that Canon's 10 MP cameras capture better images. I have found this one to be fine for average stuff, but I usually am taking 3 or 4 shots at a time hoping that one or two of them won't be washed out or overly grainy, even on AUTO. The small size also makes it hard to hold and get a steady shot. I have not tried all of the shooting modes but the ones I have tried are pretty decent. The kids and pets one is not nearly as good as it was on my old fuji camera, the macro and digital macro is good, the fireworks mode is pretty good if you hold it still, landscape and night portrait also seem decent. Don't get me wrong, it still takes good pictures that are acceptable for a small pocket point-and-shoot, but don't be fooled by the 12 MP rating and think the pictures are going to know your socks off.Not very many video options, and even if they are HD, don't expect too much because the focus is not very impressive. Once you begin recording, the focus locks and you must keep your subject in focus by moving the camera. Not archive quality for the family christmas, but good enough for some high quality you-tube fun. I've really been enjoying the video feature.Clunky controls. I've been using this thing almost daily for the past month and the controls still have me confused. I push the wrong button pretty much every time. The small icons on the buttons don't do much good.My only complaint about the frame is the rinky dink battery door. One good drop on the ground and that door is a goner, but the camera does have a wrist lanyard.All in all I am pleased.

Now that I've used it for over a month now and on several trips I can confidently say this is the best camera at its size and price. If someone can produce another camera at this size and weight with similar features and image quality with a lower price please provide a link to it. I tested Nikons and Panasonics and they all had worse IQ, and even other bigger Canons but disliked the bulk.The best feature of course is its size, it fits comfortably in my pocket with a cell phone too. The pictures are great and the shutter speed is amazing, especially if you turn off the picture review and want to take many pictures in a row but just not in continuous mode. The Auto works great for most anything, however indoors and in low light, its best to raise your ISO and use program mode.My minor complaints would be the display quality(noisy),audio quality, and only 3x optical zoom. I would love it with 5x optical zoom and better audio, but its not any worse then the audio on the Flip.

My one complaint is that the SD 780's video format is now Quiktime .mov (all earlier Canon SDxxx used .avi).  This can be slightly annoying if your computer runs Windows and you expect to use Windows Media Player, Windows Movie Maker, etc. to view/edit videos because these applications can't handle the .mov created by the SD 780.

Battery included essentially DOA'd. Cannot Charge battery Via USB. Battery warms up quickly, heating up the entire camera, battery will bulge, the manual says thats normal. One rechargeable NB-4L battery cost $45 in stores, while a longer lasting BP-CN4L battery is $15 online. Just add the USB charging feature like a normal person, problem freaking solved! I have a nifty Portable Kensington USB charger pack I carry around with me. It charges all my phones,mp3 players, and other portable devices just fine. Using the bulky Canon charger until the light went green(about 90mins), I popped the battery in the camera. Power saving mode on, sounds off, brightness at its lowest, took a couple of pictures but mainly recorded videos. Roughly 10GB and about an hour of 720p HD video later I got the swap battery pack black screen warning, it lasted roughly 90 mins turned on. Thats well below the 5 hours advertised.2. Proprietary SCAM MUCH?! No Mini HDMI Cable is as expected to keep costs down even though you can get a Targus mini HDMI for around $15(does not work with SD780), Unfortunately Canon screws you by making it so that their own mini hdmi cable is basically the only cable that works for that camera, forcing you to cough up $80+ on their online store and wait over a week for it to arrive! Even though it has a mini usb port it does not work with any of my mini USB cables, only the white one that came with it worked, essentially making it yet another proprietary cable! Others might have better luck but this is a heads up that NOT all cables will work with this camera.3. NOISE! Tons of it! Audio quality is Mono 44 kHz, Stereo would have been ideal for 720p HD and might of fixed that annoying noise issue. Some say its the type of SD card that affects the noise. I'm using the Transcend 16GB SDHC Class 6 SD Card that came out around the same time this camera came out so it should be 100% compatible and working properly but like others state the mechanical noise of the camera is unbearable when recording indoors or in quiet places. The SD card is fine; the camera is the issue IMO.I called Canon technical support and they said the type of SD card you use won't affect video/audio performance in any way for this type of camera and the reason for the noise is because of the \"ultra sensitive microphone\" built into it.4. This thing is small! Maybe too small for the big handed people like me! I keep putting my fingers in front of the lens when it turns on and it prevents from opening all the way and gives me a \"lens error, please restart camera\" warning.5. Video quality suffers in low lit areas. Video does weird blue laser beams on the lights on my chandelier and the big tall parking lot lights outside of strip malls make huge long blue beams, kinda cool, I call it the Jay-Z music video effect, but they could get annoying. It doesn't auto white balance that well either, each room has different levels and sources of lighting. I would have to stop the recording and go to functions then white balance, press the disp button to balance the color then press record again. I would manually auto balance in one room to get a crisp normal color but as soon as I moved to the next area the color became saturated.For example, when I first go into my kitchen it would be a faint green yellow color, I would manually auto balance to get the color back to normal. Then when I moved to my bedroom it would turn into a faint blue color because of all the blue LEDS from my desktop tower and keyboard (Antec 900, Eclipse blue backlit keyboard), or to the living room it would be a reddish pink.With auto white balance on it barely changes the color balance when it can do so much better.  The Tech on the phone said Auto White Balance quality is a matter of opinion, after some further testing Auto white balance seemed to get better which further solidifies my claim that this is a defective unit. Kind of annoying but its tolerable for now since I have no time to return it because I have a Vegas trip in 2 days.Pictures are fine your standard 8 to 10 Megapixel (MP) camera can do the same quality as this camera; 12.1 Megapixel is pretty gimmicky if you ask me but I could be wrong.I'm returning this Camera and getting a replacement, I'm hoping I was just unlucky and got a defective camera but we will see. If it helps this one is the Silver color, my replacement will be in Black. Anyways these are my first impressions; I'll keep you posted, we will see if this camera is worth the purchase when I receive my replacement.4/15/10 Update: Got the black one, the blue beam issue is still there so it has something to do with how the camera lens was made and how florescent lights affect it. The audible mechanical noise is still there also but doesn't seem as bad as the silver one,recording with my car stereo on the music came out good and drowned out any of that noise. So you will definitely hear it if you're in a quiet environment. Also the black one seems to be made out of a more sturdier aluminum that is also more grip-able or maybe I'm just partial to black. ;)This video is raw unedited 720p HD from the camera itself.Name: MVI_0041.MOVLENGTH: 00:00:12SIZE: 33.8 MBDate created: 4/13/2010 5:33 PM MSTVIDEOResolution: 1280x720Data Rate: 22936kbpsTotal Bit rate: 23656kbpsFrame Rates: 30 FPSFormat: Quick Time Movie (.MOV)AUDIOBit rate: 719kbpsChannels: 1 (mono)Audio sample rate: 44 kHz5 Stars for Amazon's Legendary Customer Service!", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Solid camera with very good video capability as a bonus.", "Author": "D R", "ReviewID": "R1WXE8ASL1DNMB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll give my observations of the HD video capabilities of this camera; I wouldn't consider this a full review.

I found that a 16GB memory card is the perfect match for the battery life.Each video clip has a file size limit of 4GB due to the FAT32 limitations of current SD cards. There is also a 30 minute cap in recording time for each HD clip, although you will probably deal with the 4GB cap more often. There is an on-screen warning that the movie is getting close to either one.The battery outlasted my memory card, but not by much. I recorded around 88 minutes of video and used up the entire card (15GB). The battery still had some life left so I popped in my spare 4GB card and the battery finally died around 2 minutes later. The average running time of the videos that reached the 4GB file size limit was around 22-24 minutes. A spare battery is recommended if you have a larger memory card and want to use this solely for video.I hope you found this information helpful.Tidbits:- You can't use optical zoom while recording, only digital zoom. This is basically the only thing you can adjust once you begin filming.- Focus is set when you start recording and does not change until you stop and start again. You can preview focus with a half-press prior to recording.- You can use one of the three focus modes (macro, normal, infinity) for filming.- Image Stability does work on video recording.- The audio for recording is Mono. I don't see this as an issue. The sound quality is good, even if it is only one channel.", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "SD780 review (from a SD770 owner)", "Author": "J. Pollard", "ReviewID": "R211EEYWRKZWTY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The SD780 is Canon's replacement for the 10 MP SD770 model released around a year before it. I upgraded to the SD780 as I was happy with my SD770 but liked the new features and smaller profile.The interface has improved, most notably with the automatic shooting mode detection. As I have a dSLR for serious photography I used the SD770 as more of a happy snaps camera and as such it spent nearly all it's life in the automatic profile. The SD780 utomatically activates a suitable shooting profile in auto mode (when taking a close range photo for example it will automatically select macro mode), and so far I've found this system to be very quick and accurate. It's lighter than the 770 (which itself is quite light) and doesn't cause any discomfort in your pocket thanks to it's slim profile. Another improvement is a wider lens (it's no Panasonic FX37, but a 33mm equivalent wide end is better than 35mm) which was one of the shortcomings of the older model. Unfortunately the SD780's lens is f3.2-5.8 which means it does struggle at times with low light even with the optical image stabilisation system activated. The lens itself is quite good for a compact point and shoot, with no noticable barrel distortion. Shooting performance is excellent, as good or even better than the previous model with very quick power up to shooting times, shot to shot times and minimal shuttter lag.The CCD resolution has been increased to 12.1 megapixels but is the same physical size. This coupled with quite agressive noise reduction means that image quality does suffer at high ISO settings. Combined with the relatively slow lens it's night performance isn't quite as good as some of it's rivals, but is still adequate quality for casual shooting. While the extra resolution is a bonus in daylight shooting I can't help wondering if the resolution increase was more of a marketing excercise than anything else, and whether the camera would have better served retaining the older 10 MP image sensor.720P video is a welcome addition as is the switch from Motion JPEG to H.264 video. The video files are stored in the Quicktime container so Mac users especially will find it easy to work with video files from the camera. Battery life is best described as adequate, Canon has switched from the NB-6L to the smaller NB-4L which means battery life is rated at 210 shots, which is lower than average. The batteries charge quickly however and the battery life isn't really a problem if you charge it after every trip.Overall I would say that the SD780 is a solid camera with a couple of shortcomings, mainly due to the packaging constraints. I bought the 770 because I wanted something that was as carryable and convenient as a cameraphone but with decent quality images.

I started snapping some indoor and outdoor pics and videos as soon as I got home.  I downloaded them to my computer and took a look at the results.  They were not nearly as great as I was expecting after reading all the reviews so I decided to break out my old sd600 and take side by side shots and compare the two.  I was shocked!  My old sd600, which is only 6MP by the way, took much sharper, colorful and clearer pics than this camera!  Even when I blew the pics up the sd600 still outperformed this camera.  This made me wonder how the hd video would compare to the pocket cameras.  I ordered the Vado HD from Amazon and received it two days later.  I shot side by side video with both cameras to compare the two.  The video from the Vado HD turned out to be much better in all lighting conditions.  The video was clearer, sharper with better color saturation and was $100 less!  So this camera is going back to best buy.

I get irritated at people who won't turn off their flash, then complain when highlights are blown.Ignore the review that says the optical view finder is \"useless\".  The optical finder is one of the best features of this camera and very rare in compacts these days.  Though an LCD is great, a viewfinder allows you to hold the camera discreetly against your face.  A viewfinder backs you up when bright sunlight washes out the LCD.  It also allows you to turn off the LCD to get significantly more battery time.I researched Nikon, Panasonic, Olympus and other Canons before buying this one.

Playing with the incredibly small Canon SD780 for a few days, it's a good time to take a step back and recognize the amazing technology which has come to us through the digital revolution. There is simply no comparison to the photographic capability which one can now carry hardly noticed in a shirt pocket, including taking high def VIDEOS! Decent pictures at ISO 800 or even 1600. Amazing. Also, Canon listen to customer feedback; their menus and interfaces are simpler and cleaner than some of the other makers. Finally, the price is really very low for the sophistication that goes into one of these babies - the equivalent of about forty bucks in 1970's dollars when the first compact cameras hit the market at much higher prices.There is only one downside - this camera is so small, and the sensor is so small, that 12MP is too many for top picture quality. I would have voted for fewer pixels, 8 MP instead of 12MP - and get lower noise in return. The exposure sometimes leaves blownout highlights. If absolute image quality is your top priority, there may be other Canon's to look at. But if you're not that picky, the results are excellent. The video function works well and I use it all the time since I find a short movie (a few seconds) is a better remembrance of an event than a still photo.

Camera is too small and too light to hold steady for 10-15 mins continously while taking video- stabilization doesnot seem to work. you will see small movements in the video which are irritating - reflects your hand moving during that time. No good surface to get a good grip and hold nicely.2. Zoom - is useless in low light and at max zoom 3x images appear grainy. lot of fuzzy pictures at high zoom.forget about digital zoom.3. Pictures - quality of pictures (steady , no movement) is same as my old s410. Nature photos like trees,foilage are more clear with s410, appears fuzzy with sd7804. File size - 12MP is useless, creates more grainy pictures and increases file size. A 8 or 10MP camera with better/bigger lens will take good pictures.5. In good light - Nothing extra ordinary - any camera will take good pictures. dont see value in paying 225+$ for that.6. Battery - Got very hot after about half an hour of charging. The battery charger and battery became very hot and i had to let it rest for a few minutes before inserting into camera.7. LCD - very grainy. with a camera this expensive i want to enjoy taking pics. When i look at LCD, pictures appear grainy, so dont feel like taking a picture although i must say that the final pic is good. i can understand LCD resolution is less, but grainy LCD is definitely not appealing.8.

Even after seeing a picture of the camera hiding behind a credit card I was not prepared for how small it is! The buttons are recessed and the whole camera slips easily into a pocket without snagging on anything. Despite its small size, the LCD is easy to view, and the buttons are very usable.The second moment of awe was powering on. The camera turns on and off very quickly! Some other point-and-shoot digitals we've had have had a considerable delay before they are ready to shoot, extending the lens and running through the self-test of the software. This camera is not quite instantaneous, but it's very fast!The pictures are good quality, and it's easy to switch between photo and video mode. Another fun surprise was that the auto-focus places the camera in macro mode when you try to focus on something right in front of the lens.

It also has a useful feature that I use all the time: you're only one button away from an exposure compensation control.  The image stabilization feature works well and gives you decent low-light capability.The only downside, and the reason I can't recommend it, is that my camera is full of sensor dust after only 6 months of use.  Now I'll admit, I don't coddle my cameras.  I keep it in my pants pocket or a pocket in my briefcase.  That environment proved to be too much for the SD780 to handle.  There's no way to clean it, and this is not covered by the warranty, so I can no longer use it.This may sound like nitpicking, but my logic is this: a camera this small has only one reason for being...to always be at hand.  If I have to keep it in a case, then a) it won't fit in my pocket, so it's likely to be left behind, and b) it's not ready for quick access, so I will lose shots either to laziness or delay.So, if you're willing to keep it in a case and protect it from dust when not in use, buy it.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent travel camera", "Author": "High Roller", "ReviewID": "R372SRLDZIK7QV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was in the market for a new point and shoot since my Canon S40 was a dud. I cam across this and was immediately attracted by its size and weight. I primarily use this camera on travel for photos however I also use it for other things as well. By no means am I a professional or even seasoned amateur when it comes to photography. I simply needed something to capture the moments. This little thing fit the bill quite nicely and I couldn't be any happier with it.The features that impressed me the most were the 12MP, Lithium ion battery, size/weight, and functionality of it.With a lot of other point and shoots, the camera's have selector wheels that allow you to adjust the settings based on the environment, lighting, etc, to get the best picture. Only problem is that, when taking that once in a lifetime shot, screwing around with the selector wheel is the last thing one should be worried about. This camera is a true point and shoot which is what I liked the most about this camera. You simply turn it on, point and snap. The start up time for the camera is very quick (I'd say 2 seconds). Since I don't have to screw around with a selector wheel, this camera allows me to snap away at whatever i want and let the processor figure out what's best for the shot. An often overlooked but really great feature of this camera.The video recording on this is so-so although I wouldn't expect high grade video quality from something like this. Overall though, it's a nice little feature of this camera since it takes videos in 720p resolution. The files are limited at 30 minutes a piece and, if plan on using this thing for video purposes, you're going to need a large SDHC card since the video files can get massive in size, real quick. I currently use a 32GB card with a 16GB for backup and those workout great for me. I also purchased an aftermarket extended battery for this off eBay for $5 and really like that as well.The picture quality of the camera is quite nice. For the average 3x5 or 4x6 photo, this camera will capture almost every detail in the pic. The large size of the photos come out at 4000 x 3000 pixels which can be blown up to poster size (if i'm not mistaken). I recently had some photos blown up to 12 x 18 posters and there was no loss of quality in the pics. Really nice picture quality for those scrap booking people. The 12MP is a way overkill for a 4x6 photo but it never hurts to have photos that are TOO clear.The size/weight of this is almost negligible. It's tiny, lightweight and you'd almost forget you're carrying it around. Fits in my jean pockets or my backpack cellphone case without any issues. Recently took this on a snowboarding trip and it stood up to the cold and some wetness without fail. I wouldn't go so far as to call this thing very durable as the matte finish is a magnet for scratches, however, it does work well in pretty much any condition and can withstand normal wear and tear.My only real \"complaints\" about this thing is the picture quality in low light conditions and the size of the LCD screen. When snapping photos in low light/nighttime settings, the pictures come out looking like you're in the middle of a snow storm. I'm sure the preferences can be fine tuned a bit in manual mode however I haven't gotten that far yet with this thing. the LCD size is a bit on the tiny side but still works for using as your main viewfinder and reviewing pics/videos you've taken.Overall, I'm really happy with this thing and it should be my main point and shoot for some time. It has pretty much all the features the average person needs or is looking for in a camera. Since the new SD line is out, I'm sure you can pick this one up for cheaper than I did.

Along with the ultra-portable size, it comes with four colors, gold, red, silver and black. The camera is very sleek and fashionable.Here is Canon Powershot SD780 IS spec:  * 12 Megapixel / 1/2.3 sensor  * 80-3200 ISO range  * 2.5' LCD screen (230k)  * Optical image stabilization  * 33mm- 100mm (3X zoom length)  * f/3.2 (W) - f/5.8 (T) aperture  * Record HD video  * Dimension: 3.43 x 2.15 x 0.72 in./87.0 x 54.5 x 18.4mm  * Weight: 115g camera body onlyIMAGE QUALITYCanon SD 780 IS has 1/2.3' sensor size which is considered very small but not the smallest. From my test, SD780's image quality really depend on the lighting situation or what ISO setting that you use. In low ISO setting, like 80-200, the image quality is very good. But from 400 and up, the image started to break down (lose detail and unsharp edges) due to aggressive noise reduction. However, the color / contrast are still very consistent through out.Like all Canon cameras, image straight out of the camera are generally vivid and punchy. Canon usually boosts the red and it makes the image warmer than reality.This camera is not something you want to use for serious photography work, but it is very good for web sharing,  regular 4\u00d76  print. For ISO comparison images, please visit my blog.BODY AND HANDLINGCanon SD780 body is surprisingly very good. It is very small, the width and length has the same size as credit card, and the depth is only 0.7 thick. It is smaller than many cellphone in the market.The body feels very solid and dense, buttons are small, but not flimsy. The layout is typical of compact camera. It has playback, function, menu, display, flash, macro, self-timer/trash, direct print/exposure compensation, shutter button, zoom lever, and on-off button.Surprisingly, it also has a optical viewfinder. But the viewfinder is so small (maybe around 0.2 x) that it is quite challenging to use it, especially for people who wear glasses. The viewfinder is electronic viewfinder meaning that what you see in the viewfinder is what you will see in the camera. However, for people who like to compose picture from eye level, this will be a nice addition.It has 3X zoom lens, from wide 33mm to 100mm. This focal length is good for general purpose. It is great outdoor, but not very for indoor because it is not very wide. Taking group picture indoor will be a bit of a challenge but do-able. The maximum aperture is quite small, so it will be  a challenge in low light or when you want to make a blurred background.LCD screen is pretty standard. 2.5' inch is generally big enough but the resolution only 230k. It is not a the best but good enough to view your image and compose pictures.OPERATION & FEATURESThis camera is pretty much a straightforward some settings that you can change. It has Auto mode, Program mode and video recording mode. The P mode can be changes in function menu to several scene modes, such as portrait, night shot, kids&pets;, indoor and sunset.If you want to change setting, just press the function button. From there you can change various settings such as shooting mode, ISO setting, white balance, color retouch, metering mode, shutter release mode and image size.Regarding image size, you can choose either standard 4:3 ratio or 16:9 wide screen ratio.Other features the camera has are face detection, blink detection and image stabilization.OPERATION PERFORMANCEStart up time is considered fast for compact camera. It only requires around 1 sec to power on.  Auto focus speed and  is generally fast as well (.5 sec). General operation are also very fast and nothing to worry about. Thanks to the DIGIC IV processor.CONCLUSIONCanon Powershot SD780 IS Digital Elph is a compact camera that is optimized for its size, look and performance. Image quality is generally good for outdoor in a sunny day, but not very good in indoor setting or in low light situation such as in an overcast day. Regarding camera operation, it is responsive, and easy to use. I recommend this camera for casual snap shooters who need high performance, ultra portable compact camera.For images, please visit my blog. You can click on my profile to get the blog address.

And I found this camera. Amazon took forever to deliver, and I was very upset about it. But since I've used it for a few days, I forgave Amazon!First, quality of pictures: very sharp. I think that's because of the 12MP feature. It is said the pictures can be made into posters of photo-quality. I believe so.Second, the AUTO function is extremely helpful. You just point and shoot and 90% of the time it comes out perfect, unless the object is moving too fast.Third, anti-shakes works well.Fourth, takes decent pictures in a low-light situation. That was what bugs me with the old one. The flash ruins it sometimes, so I'll just turn it off when it's a little dark and the pics come out just fine.Fifth, you can change the sound system so your camera can make loud noises or be completely mute when you operate it. Isn't cool?Sixth, the battery takes a short time to charge, although I wish it lasts a little longer: If you video, expect it to be empty within half an hour. If you take pictures, a couple hundred would do it.Seventh, the battery and memory card slot functions very easily and securely.Eighth, the screen doesn't go completely black when under the sun.Ninth, it's very small and light.I chose this color because it's the cheapest among all other colors of this model and I thought it would be okay since I like red. But after receiving it, I understand why it's the cheapest. It looks a little \"too dull\" and \"too much\" on the little space you got on this tiny product. And the red is not exactly the best red, it just looks dull that's all I could say to explain. But judging by its excellent performance, I am very happy with it. The color doesn't matter any more.One minor \"flaw\" I should say, is that the \"shoot\" button is placed too close to the center, so sometimes when I shoot, my index finger covers the upper corner of the screen and I will have to be conscious of this.This is the very first review after only a few days I've used it.

Had experienced through so many of them already. I was never amazed by the photo quality of the SD lines but this camera has surpassed my expectations.I normally shoot with a Canon Rebel XT - 350D, with several lenses including a 28-75mm f/2.8 and a 10-22mm wide lens. Whenever I shoot photos indoors during dinner with my SLR, people are amazed that I do not need to use the flash. Well this SD780 is absolutely THAT. I was shooting photos in doors without flash on AUTO mode and it was capturing perfectly sharp images! I think the smartness of the camera's auto ISO selection along with the amazing canon line's Imagine Stablization - IS - really helped.The size of the camera is small, like a credit card. Anyone can easily drop it in their shirt pocket, and especially the girls out there with super tight jeans, I'm sure this can be dropped into your back pocket as well. It's extremely light!!!Modes - I remember when I first used night mode in the SD400, I really loved how the photos turned out. The idea behind night mode is that it'll use the flash to capture the foreground(subject) and also extend the shutter to allow the background capture. This method generated beautiful imagery with night shots! It's too bad there's no more shutter control on this camera because I was trying to shoot an outdoor photo at night, with no flash, but I wanted to make sure to capture the beautiful architectural lights in the background. I couldn't figure it out within the 15 secs I had so I gave up. I'm fairly familiar with the SD line's menus so I didn't bother reading the manual.Videos - 720p movies in .mov format. What more can i say? I think a 2min video came out to about 350-400mb large. So if you're planning to capture some videos, make sure you have a large capacity SDHC card. I usually don't shoot videos, especially since there's no video function on my SLR, but man was it fun to capture the moment with the dialogues and just facial expressions that cannot be captured with a photograph.I was debating between SD780 vs SD940 vs SD1400 since they're successors of each other. I knew the SD1400's shape was no longer like the small footprint of the SD780, but the latter two offered a 2.7\" screen instead! A second consideration was the wide angle ability of SD940 and SD1400. Truthfully, this camera was for my gf, whom doesn't know much about photography. Whenever I ask her to take a pic with my SLR, it is always an epic fail. So I knew when she turns on the camera, if it defaults to wide angle, all her photos would look funky. So I knew a traditional 28mm equivalent would be best for an amateur shooter. Honestly wide angle is fun for architectural photography like indoor and buildings. Otherwise, wide angle really distorts the way people look in images. Wide angle is fun, but it wont be a photo I'd print out for frames.Anyways, I'm not a good writer, paragraph structure and grammars are bound to be wrong here. Just know this is A GOOD CAMERA and why it won so many editor's choice awards and why there's HUNDREDS of amazon reviews already raving about it.

I researched more than 10 cameras and decided on the Canon SD780IS. This camera is extremely portable and fit the bill perfectly. The picture quality was good, just about what I expected from a point and shoot and the video quality was also decent, but the audio noise/humm when recording video was the deal breaker.After checking Youtube (searched for Canon SD780IS Test Video), it appears that I must just have a defective unit as there are many quiet setting video recordings with the SD780IS that sound just fine, great in fact. Perhaps there is a difference in manufacturing as I understand that the Canon PowerShot SD780IS12.1 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.5-inch LCD (Black) used to be made in Japan and now, like mine, is made in China. I discovered a couple video samples with the humm, one I believe was in a review here on Amazon. I tried recording video in several different situations and the audio humm made the video unacceptable in every instance. I tried turning off the image stabilization and the noise was still present. The noise sounds almost like a fan, but not quite. To give you an example, I filmed the dog eating and drinking and the humm would obscure some of the audio that I was trying to capture. I could import the video in to Adobe Premiere and apply some audio filters to make the humm less obnoxious, but it would severely degrade the audio quality and one should not have to do this anyway.So, after much thought, I decided to return the defective camera and order the Canon PowerShot SD1400IS 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Black) rather than get a replacement SD780IS and risk getting another defective unit.I really appreciate all the user reviews on Amazon as they often help me make final buying decisions. I hope this review is helpful to someone. Bottom line, if video is not something you will ever use, the camera should be fine. If video is important, make sure your camera is performing properly, it is impossible to miss the audio noise/humm.Sorry Canon, you get two stars from me as the audio issue when recording video is unacceptable.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot SD780 IS", "Author": "Paul D.

I work on a ship and had started taking pictures of other vessels to post on the web, so I really wanted a camera that had a large optical zoom, but I wasn't ready to lay down the cash for an expensive DSLR. Other point and shoots, like the COOLPIX, had more optical zoom, but the feedback was not very good, so although the Canon Powershot SD780IS has only 3x optical zoom I bought it on the strength of the reviews. I ordered it from the ship, had amazon deliver it to the agent in the next port, and had in a few days. The camera is VERY small, and comes with a USB connection, wrist strap, manual, software, battery and charger, but you need to purchase a memory card (I also got a spare battery). You have to charge the battery before you use it, but that was pretty fast. Having been using my 6 year old OLYMPUS 3.2 megapixel camera, I was blown away between the difference in the quality of the images. With it's image stabilizer, up to about 8x digital zoom, the Canon Powershots pictures are excellent, after that up to the max of 12x they start getting a little more grainy, but still pretty good. The screen on the back of the camera is good sized and you can adjust the brightness, but like most of this type of camera it still can be difficult to see it in bright sunlight. It also has an optical viewfinder but it is tiny and somewhat difficult to use. The camera's manual is pretty good and not to hard to follow and like most of these cameras you have a full auto or manual setting in addition to being able to shoot video. Most of the features I haven't tried yet, but one I do like is being able to adjust the ISO setting in the manual mode, disable the flash and get pretty good images using the ambient light. This is great at concerts or other venues where you don't want to disturb others. I didn't care for the image software that came with the camera and instead I use Photoscape (free on the web) and Photoshop Essentials, which came with my Canoscan 8800F scanner. The photoscape software is very easy to use. As mentioned the camera is small, so it can easily fit in a purse, pant pocket or inside suit jacket pocket, but be careful as keys, loose change or other hard objects can easily scratch the view screen. The camera seems well made, but I would suggest buying a case if you plan to use it on hikes, trips or other extended outings. I gave the camera 5 stars because I was very happy with it and the overall purchasing experience. I am certainly not a photo expert, but I think most folks like me that want a decent little camera at a good price will like the Canon Powershot SD780 IS.3/9/13 UPDATE: Three years after buying this camera I'm still enjoying it immensely and have taken well over thousand pictures with it.

After all the 940 is almost the same camera, but with a slightly bigger screen, and slightly better optical zoom and wide angle.  That's a lot of slightlys.  I had ruled out Nikons and Fujis only because I really wanted the HD video, and I love that it's a MOV format instead of an AVI.  (yes I'm a mac user).  In the end I bought this camera because it was $169 on Black Friday and at an 90 difference I see no reason not to go with this camera.  Currently at a $50 difference, I would say if you happen to have the extra cash, and those slightly better features are important to you, go with the 940 - but I think if you get this camera I think you would be quickly happy and forget what the differences were anyway.This is a TINY camera.  It's quite a bit smaller then my iphone!  When you are recording video, and I found the quality quite good for such a little package, make sure you don't cover up the mic on top while holding the camera, which is easy to do since it's so small.  The IS works really well, I was amazed at what I could hand hold in low light.  Macro is quite good as well.  A feature I really like is you can have your playback display show both the whole photo and a 100% zoom so you can see the noise and focus quickly, which is super handy.  There is not a lot of manual customization on this camera, but there is a program mode where you can control some things like slow syncro flash, WB, etc.  I really wish it came with a case, but canon does make a case specifically for this camera, and you can get it on amazon.I usually hate software included with cameras, but I was forced to try it out, because the camera does not mount as an external drive, so I needed it to import photos using the camera's usb.  Surprisingly I find the software pretty handy, particularly for trimming videos.  I would recommend something else for actually enhancing your photos though.All in all, I love the size, love the video, enjoy the photo quality, and highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "December 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera for its Size", "Author": "Colts Fan", "ReviewID": "R3GMRTG05WV73W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera mainly due to its size and ability to shoot HD video.  I upgraded from a Sony DSC-P8, which took pretty good daytime pictures but horrible low light shots and the shutter lag was ridiculously long.  Also, I couldn't fit the camera in my pocket because it was so thick.  This camera is an improvement in all of those categories.  Of course I understand the Sony DSC-P8 is an older camera and most new cameras would be better.This is the smallest, slimmest camera I have ever owned.  I also have a Canon XSi DSLR which allows for more flexibility and takes professional looking shots but its by no means compact.  When going out with friends or on a short trip, I'd much rather take the Canon SD780 IS which I can fit in my pocket.  I also purchased the Canon PSC-1050 camera case from Amazon which is made specifically for this camera, as stated on the packaging.  If you buy this camera, you should also get this case.  Why buy a small camera only to buy a bulky third party case?To me, the low light shots are acceptable for a point and shoot camera.  The pictures still have a little bit of noise to them if you zoom in on your PC, but no where near the shots I took with my Sony.  However, even though the noise is much improved, the sharpness of the pictures suffer a slight bit.  The older Sony was better in this department.  Overall, the low light shots taken with the Canon look much better than the Sony.  I have no complaints with the daytime shots.The shutter lag is also much better than the Sony.  You can forget taking pictures of moving objects with the Sony.  It sometimes took 3-4 seconds for the camera to take the picture from the point of pressing the shutter.  The SD780 IS still has a shutter lag of about a second or less depending on the shooting conditions.  For shots of moving objects like children and pets, I have my Canon XSi.The buttons and on screen menus are easy to use and understand.  Due to the small size of the camera, the buttons are small.  I sometimes have trouble pressing the correct button.  It's not a major problem though.  I would rather have small button and a large LCD than the other way around.Overall, I am very pleased with the camera.  I never expected it to be perfect since its a rather inexpensive and compact point & shoot camera, but it exceeded the expectations that I did have and serves its purpose well.", "Date": "October 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great small camera", "Author": "xyz123", "ReviewID": "R3O3NNJNLTCCPZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a camera that I could carry in my pocket to shoot HD video of my daughter's graduation.  I looked at those pocket camcorders, but when I found I could get a tiny Canon that would shoot HD video and was also a regular camera, that sounded more versatile to me.  I have owned several Canon digital cameras before, and have always been happy with them.  After reading reviews of this one, I had two concerns:  Would it be so small that it would hard to operate with my average-sized male fingers, and would such a small device have adequate image quality?  After using it at the aforementioned graduation, I am happy to say that neither one of those concerns was a problem.  It has a quality feel and is VERY small, actually a bit shorter than my iPhone 3G, about the same width, and only a little bit thicker.  But it is very easy to operate.  It fits easily and comfortably in both my pants pocket and shirt pocket, but I bought a small cellphone case that fits it very nicely, so I can also clip it to my belt.I have a couple of suggestions for anyone who might want to use this camera for video:  First, I wasn't sure how much memory card capacity I would need, so I went ahead and bought 2 16G SDHC cards.  Good move!  I filled the first one up before the end of the ceremony, and was able to quickly swap in the second one.  The thing I didn't consider, though, was battery life.  I got a low battery warning even before I filled up the first memory card.  Fortunately, there were two parts to the ceremony, and during the break I was able to find an outlet to charge up the battery.  In general, I like the small rechargeable battery that comes with its own charger, but it would be good to have a second charged battery on hand.  Another idea I had was to screw a mini tripod into the bottom to use as a handle.  That worked out very well.  It made it easier to shoot over the heads of the people in front of me, and was probably more comfortable too.In summary, I'm completely satisfied with this camera.

Which defeats the point and shoot aspect of a small camera.So a few years later I upgraded. After reading reviews of all different brands and testing them at my local electronic super store, I decided on this Canon PowerShot SD780IS12.1 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.5-inch LCD (Black).I am very happy with it and will continue to recommend it to friends looking for a new camera.Its smaller than my old camera which was the smallest at the time and has a 12.1-megapixel resolution.  Being able to carry the camera in my front pocket with ease is what I love about small cameras.It takes great pictures, but most importantly to me is that other people can take great pictures with it and the camera stays in focus. Which means I can ask a stranger on the street to take a picture of something with me in the shot and it turns out every time.  Very important to me.Setting the camera to \"smart auto\" automatically selects an appropriate setting from 18 specially defined settings when I take a picture and it works.Optical Image Stabilizer works like a charm to help with the hand shakes.The face detection is awesome and works well thanks to the advanced DIGIC 4 image processor in the camera. A Face Detection Self-Timer automatically detects an increase in the number of faces and makes the appropriate adjustments so you can set up the family for the picture, jump in the group and still get a perfect shot. The camera knows when you are in place because it can \"see\" your face.Red eye correction works as it should. Either the camera can be set to remove the red eyes from the picture when it detects them or after you take the picture you can go back into the picture while it is on your camera and remove them.  Its easy to use and works.The camera feels very well made but if you have a hard time pressing small buttons beware the camera has only small buttons.  Not a problem for me though.HD video mode works great and looks better.

Settings I used with the last cameras leave my subjects washed out, pale, and red-eyed.

After Christmas we took a trip to Coronado, CA and we were taking pictures while on a bike ride around the island. At one point the camera was dropped, while on and with the lens out.

Winder \"computer nerd\"", "ReviewID": "R3JPGCIRLK3QNR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was traveling and in a hurry, and made the mistake of buying a Pentax Optio M20 on sale when I found I'd left my trusty old Canon SD110 at home. I call it a mistake not because there was anything terribly wrong with the Optio, but because I found it harder to get good pictures with it than with the venerable SD110, despite a friendlier user interface, much higher resolution and image stabilization.Since I use my Canon EOS 30D for my non-candid photo needs, the Pentax has been adequate for the past couple years. But as I flipped through more and more candid photos that were blurry (or focused on the plant behind the subject's face), I decided to do a little research, and ended up pre-ordering the SD780IS.I love the feel of this camera. It's sleek and solid, and fits easily into my pants pocket. The small flash offers surprisingly good coverage, considering its size, and the LCD is nicely sized and clear. The daylight shots are crisp and colorful, and the multiple face recognition makes it easy to take quick shots of several subjects at varying distances from the camera. Start up is quick, as is the image read/display rate in playback mode, and battery performance is more than adequate for casual shooting.The techie features are abundant as well. I love the blink detection and face timer, even though neither option saves much time or effort. I'm also impressed with how smoothly Canon has integrated digital zoom, so that when taking pictures at lower than maximum resolution, the effective non-interpolated zoom increases from the optical 3x; this is clearly indicated in the process, so that it's not easy to accidentally zoom beyond 1-to-1 pixel capture.There are, of course, small inconveniences that come with the miniaturization of this much technical sophistication. It took me a while to get used to the zoom lever due to its size and shape, and the navigation buttons on the back are slightly smaller than my thumb would prefer. Moving beyond ergonomics, the small aperture that this camera shares with others in the \"pocket\" genre means that low-light imaging is not always ideal (usually manifested as blur due to movement combined with a slow shutter speed; when the shutter speed is kept high, it is instead manifested as noise in the imagery due to the increased sensitivity at high ISO settings). The optical image stabilization does help, and it makes this a better candidate for low light than most of the small cameras that have come before it; it is certainly better than the two other small cameras I've owned (mentioned above) in this respect.Being able to shoot high resolution video with this camera is refreshing, and I've enjoyed that feature. I had optimistically hoped that it would be good enough that I wouldn't need a separate camcorder for video, but that was wishful thinking. It's wonderful for short, candid videos but suffers from the small aperture and--ironically--form factor for longer shots. This is manifested as movement blur and camera shake. The movement blur is much less pronounced in good lighting, but the stabilizing lens can only move so much, and the human hand is notoriously unsteady when unbraced. The size of the camera makes it that much harder to hold still, as momentum tends to slow the movement of some of the larger cameras/camcorders.In summary, I'm more than pleased with this camera and would have no second thoughts about recommending it to anyone looking for a small point-and-shoot. The defects it suffers are shared in common with all cameras of this size to some extent; as technology improves, more of these will be mitigated, but for the time being the convenience and fun being offered in this tiny package would be hard to beat at twice the price.", "Date": "April 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pixel Peeper?

Even the current Canon Elphs are slightly larger. And the Nikon's are even larger.So I came home disappointed.

The megapixels are no longer a good way to judge cameras as they can easily be increased by using more duplicate low cost sensors. Canon actually takes time to design a good quality camera instead of focusing on having the highest specs. Even with that, this 2 year old camera still is competetive to some brand new offerings even from canon.This camera is small yet very rigid and high quality. The canon digic4 processor provides all the necessary functions you need in a camera and does a great job stabilizing the image (i have shaky hands so sometimes I get the orange \"stop shaking\" icon on the screen) and automatically adjusting all the settings to make a good picture. Now (2012) I believe the newer canons are up to digic5 but not sure on that. Even in auto mode, you can manually adjust all the important things like image size, flash, and zoom without worrying about trickier things like ISO. Video works great too. The camera+8gb card is more than enough for a week of leisurely picture taking or a day of intense video/still shooting... mostly limited by the battery (300 pictures +/-50 depending on the flash).They have some cheap aftermarket batteries for $5-10 that will give you a nice additional battery boost if you take a lot of pictures. An 8gb card is more than enough even at full resolution unless you take video. In which case, I suggest a 32gb card as they are now pretty cheap (2012).My only gripe is with the shutter speed. In \"continuous mode\" it takes a picture about once a second. That is pretty slow. Some of the newer canon cameras in this class can do 8 frames per second.

It would have gotten five stars is the zoom wasn't so horrible and the flash didn't break.My camera is currently being taken care of by the geek squad at bestbuy. They are shipping and contacting canon for me! Even though I bought it at amazon (I'm still under the 1 yr warranty). I give credit to the geek squad for dealing with canon and all the repair issues. They are awesome.Would I recommend this camera? No.I'm not saying it's a bad product, but I cannot overlook the fact that for about $30 more you can get better options from other brands-such as panasonic.

Keep in mind that this is a very small point and shoot camera so the zoom is what it is for this size camera.The only problem with this camera is the \"on\" button.  This button is flush with the camera body so it can take a little while to hit the button just right to turn the camera on.

Users can simply point andshoot and for the advance user there are a plethora of picture optionssuch as macro shooting mode (used for up-close pictures), lightingsettings, and even a manual ISO adjustment. Battery life is more thansufficent for a day of snapping pictures. The camera accepts the industrystandard secure digital card which makes expanding avilable memory simpleand inexpensive.The first thing you notice when you pick up the camera is the size. Thisis a very small camera: the face is no bigger than that of a credit card.The camera is well under three quarters a inch thick and the back of thecamera is dominated by a crisp 2.5 inch LCD screen. The next thing younotice is the quailty of the construction of this camera, it has a solidfeeling in your hands and instills confidence that the camera will be verydurable.  For those users who prefer a more traditional shootingexpereince, Canon even inculded a viewfinder, a feature that is becomingincreasingly rare in this category. Customers can chose from a variety ofcolors including red, silver, gold and the standard black.The stills from this camera, with adequate lighting, are quite good.Unfourtanely, image quality quickly deteriorates in low light conditions,due in part to the small size of the image sensor and the high effectmegapixel rating. Shooting video is a breeze, and although it isdissappointing that users cannot change focus or zoom levels oncerecording has begun, the compresed video looks very good on any highresoultion screen.

Smaller than even my Casio EX-S600, which was the smallest camera I had seen before the Canon SD-780, yet operable by my big hands.  It can even shoot a succesion of still photos continuously without limit until you fill up the card.  But the best feature is the 720p hi-def video.  The quality is, as far as I can tell, identical to that of the Panasonic FZ-28, which also shoots 720p hi-def but is a much larger (and of course more capable) camera.  The Canon, like the Panasonic, zooms silently while shooting video, and like the Panasonic the image stabilization works perfectly (not something one can say about all brands).  The deciding factor for me in choosing this camera was the usable ISO of 1600 reported by Consumer Reports.  Yes, the image is grainy, but not outrageously so.There are a few downsides.  Previous Canon models had a high-ISO auto-exposure feature that allowed the camera to access the highest sensitivity ratings the camera would allow.  This one does not.  The highest ISO it will access automatically is 400.  You have to manually select ISO 1600 in order to shoot at that level of sensitivity.  The sound quality when shooting video is good but not great.  The LCD screen is a good one but it is difficult to see in bright light.  Amazingly, this tiny camera does include an eye-level direct viewer just like film-type cameras used to have.I got a couple of extra batteries with the camera, the Lenmar brand from Amazon.  Inexpensive, very reliable, and equivalent to Canon OEM batteries in my experience.  A word of caution, though.  If you need an extra battery charger, say for travel, it is worth getting the Canon OEM charger, the CB-2LV or CB-2LVG, rather than an aftermarket unit.  The aftermarket chargers I have seen seem to work OK for a while, but then the battery begins to lose capacity.  The Canon charger keeps the battery working at capacity much longer.  I have some five-year-old Canon and Lenmar batteries that are still working perfectly.  In addition, the Canon charger is smaller than the aftermarket units and has a foldable AC plug.  As of late February 2010 you can get Canon OEM chargers for about $35 at Amazon or for about $30, including shipping, on eBay.Update 10-05-10  Two items.  First, the \"silent zooming\" that I observed was digital zooming.  Unlike other small Canon cameras (such as the SD750), this one has no optical zoom during video shooting.  Second, once in a while a video file appears to get corrupted or damaged, so that my video editor (Vegas 9 followed by Vegas 10) can't handle it.

The images are crisp, clear and always in focus.  You have a plethora of scene settings to choose from, but just set it on auto and let it decide how to shoot.  I guess that's what they mean by \"Point-n-shoot\".  My favorite thing about this is how small it is!  Fits right in my pocket (and is smaller than my Droid phone).

When I saw the SD780 in the store I was immediately sold.  The size of this camera is simply amazing!  I can take it just about anywhere.  The design is beautiful, simple, and intuitive.  The build quality is superb, and the camera case is all metal, which gives it a solid feel.  I did not have a case, but I borrowed my wife's motorola RAZR cell phone case and it fits perfectly!  The one she has is here:[...]While picture quality is not comparible to a digital SLR, it is certainly adequate for most point and shoot circumstances.  When judging picture quality, one must take into account the size and weight of this camera, and the ability to take this camera just about anywhere. The Widescreen mode is perfect for viewing images on a HD TV screen.  The HD Video mode is awesome, and I was amazed that my Pinnacle Studio 12 software will take video from this camera and allow it to be burned to a standard DVD.  Built-in HDMI port was the deal maker for me since the Sony requires a special [...] cable.  With this camera, you can use a standard mini HDMI cable.The camera is very fun to use and has many useful features such as in-camera red eye correction which actually works quite well, automatic scene detection, macro mode, face detection and color controls.There are plenty of image samples from this camera at this site and at pbase.One final note - read the manual!  There are manny \"hidden\" features such as the expanded scene modes and the built in digital clock which I would have NEVER found.Update 7/27/09:A five star rating was probably a bit too generous for this camera.

I've owned two of these cameras in the last couple years, and I've used them more than anything else I've ever had hands on. Second, I've used them frequently with CHDK, but primarily with the normal firmware and thus featureset.I spent most of the last two years with a SD780 in my pocket, and I'd do the same again if it weren't for this camera's single biggest flaw. (more on that later. Heheh.)Ok. For macro photos, this camera was excellent. [...] is an example of the results I got with the SD780. (you can find hundreds of other photos there I took with this camera. There aren't many other cameras I ever used. If the link expires, you can find me on Flickr by searching for Flutterbudg't. (don't forget the odd twirly E thing. :D)) However, I've taken about 20,000 pictures in the last couple years, so this isn't full representative of its abilities.The main reason I got the SD780 originally was because my SD1000 died on me at an event I couldn't miss. Thus, I doled out 260 dollars -- one of the purchases I most regret in my life. However, this is solely due to the awful pricing I found at Best Buy at the time. Regardless, I managed to take dozens of photos and videos at that event and have continued to for the last two years.This camera does suffer in low-light situations, but I managed to avoid them quite readily. It'll be a day worth remembering when you can get a grain-free snapshot in a dim room at 1/60th of a second exposure. Maybe that's today, but my budget can't permit me find out at this time.This camera is wonderfully small, reasonably light, and, after having it in my pocket this long, I seldom realize it's there.Some have complained about the sort of flat design of the buttons, claiming that it's difficult to press them, when so small and flush with the camera's back surface. However, be it because of my make-do attitude, or because I've used it so long, or because it's actually not that bad, I don't have the same complaint. I can navigate through photos, menus, and the ever-useful built-in clock (which I frequently use as a flashlight). Its features and functionality out of the box are wonderful, if you take the time to know it, and have an appetite for discovery and learning.Furthermore, if you get CHDK (the Canon Hack Development Kit), you're given a large set of other functions, including an intervalometer, ISO, focus, and exposure bracketing, control of the ND-filter (which seems to have something to do with aperture), as well as (with scripting) a host of more advanced functions. My particular tastes in subjects and situations probably isn't the same as many people, and CHDK isn't for everyone. CHDK eked out the most possible functionality from my SD780, and I'll do the same if I happen by another Powershot, but the extra functionality sometimes isn't worth the trouble.And the bad part. The single biggest problem I've had with my current SD780 (and the identical model I had before it) was that the lens (on the inside, no less), got dust or debris or something on it a few months into usage. After a while, I started not using the zoom on my camera at all (when fully zoomed, the artifacts were significantly more sharp than at full wide-angle).Even so, the artifacts were really problematic, and, with my first SD780, I attempted to send it to Canon to have it fixed. Weeks after sending it, for postage I was hesitant to pay in the first place, Canon emailed me back essentially saying they could do it, but they asked the price of the camera, used, about $130, if I recall correctly. Naturally I had them ship it back and was inordinately ticked off. I think the problem may have been that the warranty had expired mere days after I shipped it. Regardless, I got it returned and used it for several more months.This camera is an excellent point-and-shoot. I've recommended it to a friend, and I'd do it again if it weren't for the two generations of new Powershots. You can trust it to survive short falls and ask for more, it can take excellent macro shots, and if it weren't for the artifacting problem, there would be little to complain about at all.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loved it when it worked.", "Author": "KSE Uri", "ReviewID": "RV6J8JTFC2RD0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this camera for Christmas as an upgrade to my SD880is and loved the compact size and image quality (although not quite as good in my opinion compared to the SD880is but the compact size compensated for the lesser quality).Then I started sporadically getting the lens error that others have mentioned.

So nice that it took a little bit for me to take it out doors. It is a really tough little camera as well, I put mine through hell and not once did the lens cover stick when turned on and it always focused on time with no lag. The photos always looked great and the HD video is awesome, and you can zoom while in HD mode. Video was so good that some of my footage was used in a ski film. The functions and menu options are easy to access but a little limited if you are a pro photographer and want more options. I really liked how easy it was to adjust the aperture. Just hit the +/- button and the scale pops up on bottom of the screen.  I did not like the lack of zoom strength. For me this is an issue because I take most of my photos while in the mountains. When trying to zoom in on my buddy climbing or skiing I just couldn't get close enough.

The modes set with the camera are somewhat easy, you need to play with it for a while to get the hang of it. You can record and take phots in black and white, vivid, etc. which is really cool. It also has the color accent feature which is really nice too. As for the picture quality, I find that its not as good as my previous camera but the video quality makes up for it. It is true HD and it looks amazing. As for the ease of editing for Youtube can be a real HASSALE!!! For one thing you have to convert the video to be able to even edit it. I use Windows Movie Maker and the files have to be converted to AVI. or WMV which lessens the quality of the video. So if you like editing your videos on a PC and want HD video, this is not your camera. But APPLE computers take the file and you can edit it with more ease. Also the image stabilizer does not really work unless you zooming in on something. I do makeup videos on Youtube and want to show the small writing on a product but it ends up looking blurry. But overall its a nice camera to have. But if your looking for just a video recorder and no picture taking I suggest getting a camcorder. I really wish I had gone that route but hey im happy with it!

When the camera is in auto mode there is no option to leave the flash on. You can only leave the flash on in program mode. I took some photos of my daughter with a bright daylight sun directly behind her. The auto flash did compensate for the back light but the photos were a little washed out. The same photos taken in program mode with the flash on were way better in appearance. The macro feature, in Auto Mode, automatically kicks in when the camera detects the distance required to use it. I thought that feature was pretty cool. Being able to hook up this camera to my TV with an HDMI 1.3 Cable (Type C) was a blessing in disguise. There are a lot of HDMI 1.3 (Type C) cables out there that are a lot less expensive than what Canon sells. HDMI Type C Cables have a standard HDMI connector on one end and a \"Mini\" HDMI connector on the other end. Look around before you buy. I paid less than 5 bucks for mine including S&H.; Playing back HD video images on my HDTV was an awesome experience.The only thing I found a little cofusing and I wish this issue was addressed in the users manual was what CLASS of SD card gives the best video results. I spent 2 - 3 days doing research about this and I could not come up with anything conclusive about which class of SD card should be used for the best video results. The general consensus seems to be the faster the transfer rate the better quality of video. I didn't realize until after reading many, many reviews of SD cards out there that there are Class, 2, 4, 6 & 10 SD Cards and again, the general consensus seems to be that SANDISK SD Cards have the most accurate/reliable transfer rate (They are also the most expensive). Most of the reviews I have read for and about this camera suggest either a Class 4 or 6 SD Card. I must have read at least 15 different reviews about this camera. I even sent an e-mail to Canon customer support and they didn't have a definitive answer. Their generic answer pretty much said to use whatever looks good to you. So what are we supposed to do?? Buy 3 different Class SD cards and see which ones look best?? That seems a little counterproductive. I really wish that there was even a \"Suggested\" class to use in the users manual. Why can't Canon, who makes some of the best products on this planet, keep up with SD Class technology and publish this info in their camera's users manuals?? The Sony DSC-W100 camera this camera replaced has a flash on option in auto. I got excellent use for 3 years of heavy use out of my Sony before it died. I hope this one can fill its shoes for longevity. My wife loves this camera also. She uses auto mode and I use program mode.

Maybe once it gets stretched out it would fit it, but it doesn't now.  And they have change the magnetic clasp and it is very weak.  Will not lay flat with camera in case.

I often used the SCN settings on my Kodak even though auto worked just fine (if not better than the scenes).I will say I am a bit disappointed at the Auto feature on this camera. This is a point-and-shoot camera and as such I feel that the Auto setting should be much better than it is. After reading lots of reviews all about Canon's \"Smart Auto\" I figured this would be a good buy. I will say that the Smart Auto is kind of cool and it definitely works, but pictures are not at all what they should be (on Auto) for a 12MP camera. That is, however, my only real complaint.After reading over the manual I have started playing with the Canon's scene settings--there are a lot of these, which is fantastic. Though there are some scenes that are pretty worthless in my opinion (read: underwater, fireworks). The camera takes MUCH better pictures when you use the scene settings. MUCH, MUCH better. I do wish that there was an \"Outside/Sunny\" setting because I find that using \"Beach\" or \"Snow\" do not work at all on a bright day...they just throw the white balance of the photo way off.

In looking for a replacement there were so many positive reviews on the SD780 that I wondered if it was some sort of marketing gimmick. Well, I liked the styling, the specs, and the price so I thought I'd take a chance on it and can now see why others were so enthusiastic.To be honest when I first opened the box the camera was about the size of a deck of cards and was quite smaller than I expected. I wondered if I could even work the buttons. No worries. The size grew on me (if you will excuse the pun) and although the power button is smaller than I would prefer, the rest of the controls can be manipulated comfortably. I bought the gold color camera and think it's beautiful.For starters the camera is pretty intuitive if you just want to jump into it, but I recommend studying the manual at some point to really understand the finer points and incredible features. By the way, unlike others, this manual is very well written and useful. You can also download a pdf version from the Canon website. The \"auto\" mode is a no-brainer, but using the varied programmed settings is pretty easy. I like the fact that a particular program function has a plain English title to go with the icon since icons always confuse me. I don't take much video, but it worked amazingly well for a small camera. The clarity and colors of the still photos were a huge improvement from my previous camera. I'm still learning and playing though.One of the big features for me is the digital macro function. I use my camera extensively in business and often need to take macro shots of components. I was blown away by this capability. It was better than my macro lenses on my old SLR 35mm cameras. Just read the manual instructions first.I was surprised that it didn't come with a memory card so I ordered a 4GB which is adequate for my needs. I do recommend a case and the LCD screen protector that will protect the display from scratches, fingerprints and is supposed to reduce glare. With the understanding that there is not much real estate on this camera, my improvement wish list would be for a larger power button, a better access door to the USB/HDMI ports, and a plug in charger so you don't have to take the battery out.

But te average shooter won't be doing extensive image processing, and the image quality is high enough that you still have no problem getting 11x14 (or larger!) paper prints if desired from good quality images. If you're looking for a full-featured, shirt pocket camera that shoots great video with excellent low light capability, the SD-780IS answer!

I (and my wife) are disapointed with the video quality of the canon sd780 in mid to low lighting.  Outdoors during the daytime - video looks great.  In dim lighting the video is extreemly grainy!  Indoors with the lights on at night time in our house video looks grainy, in the kitchen with brighter lighting the video looked ok, maybe slightly grainy.  If you are in a room with less than ideal lighting video looks very grainy/fuzzy.  That was the case last night when we tested it in our greatroom that has average to slightly below average indoor lighting.  We tested it via hdmi to our HDTV and also on my computer.  I had a Canon sx200is (12X optical zoom, 720p video w/ hdmi output).  The video was also grainy indoors at night time with the lights on but I don't think it was as bad as the sd780 (it's hard to say).  I returned the sx200is because if I was going to have a camera with 12Xs zoom I wanted it to zoom during video and I liked the size of the sd780.  The sd780 is a very nice sized little camera.  The 2.5\" screen looks great and has the same resolution as the 3\" screen on the sx200is, in my opinion the 2.5\" looks sharper.  I am happy overall but I don't think it will replace my old HI-8 camcorder in low light situations unfortunately.  And because there is no optical zoom I still will use the camcorder now and then.  But for most situations it is nice to only take this small camera around for pictures and 720p video.If you are looking for a camera that zooms during video (12X optical zoom)and has 720p video w/ hdmi and has great reviews look up the panasonic zs3 (the lcd screen is also sharper vs. the canon - twice as many pixels).  I was debating between that one and the canon sd780.  I chose the canon for the size and the price.  The panisonic is about $399.I almost gave the review 3 stars due to the dim video quality.

I've tried 3 or 4 different still cams that do HD video, and so far the Canon rules them all. It beats the video from my main digicam, a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5.  Although the TZ5 lets you zoom while shooting, it inevitably loses focus while doing so. So that's a wasted feature.In contrast, you cannot zoom on the Canon while shooting, but you can pre-zoom before hitting the record button. This trade-off in my opinion, is worth the far better video quality of the Canon. The color is true and there is a lot less noise and graininess than the Panasonic. Just make sure you disable the digital zoom.Don't expect miracles for video from any still camera. My only expectation was respectable video quality under optimal (i.e. daylight) conditions.

For example, I know that a $200 point and shoot camera will never take as awesome photos as my $3500 digital SLR, or even as my Powershot G10. But at the same time, I'm not going to go out on a night of drinking with my friends and bring a digital SLR because a) it's expensive and b) bulky.Having said that, I'm really impressed at the output of the pictures. At the default high resolution JPG, I was blown away at how crisp the images were. At higher ISOs, the photos became progressively noisier - but that's a problem that's common among most point and shoot cameras. I'm not too worried - again, this is a camera I'm taking out and about and taking snapshots, not trying to be Annie Liebovitz. Prints at 8x10 look fine.The 720p video is rather slick - even while goofing around taking videos, the videos were of decent enough quality that I'd be happy posting them to YouTube or Facebook. And no \"rolling shutter', which is kind of cool. I'd recommend getting a Class 6 SDHC card for the camera, so it'll write the HD video fast enough to the camera without having to deal with dropping video. The optical zoom doesn't work in video mode, but digital zoom does. Digital zoom, in my experience, generally leads to awful photos and videos, so I try to avoid it all costs.The SD780 is easy to operate, and there's virtually zero learning curve if you have experience with other Canon cameras.One of the common complaints is that the camera's casing will attract dings, scratches and other things that will keep your camera looking less than pristine. If you're going to be buying this camera, you're better off spending $25 extra to get the Invisible Shield cover for this camera.For under $250, this camera is great.

Since then to now, Jan 2013, I have learned, experimented, and improved my photography methods with this camera. First thing, this camera can take some stunning photos, however, just like with any camera, you have to setup angle, lighting, and focus right or it won't be worth anything. It captures images at 3000x4000 pixels (which if you do not know, that is a fairly huge photo). The video is at 720p and it works just fine like that! The only downside to the video is that I do not believe the focus can be changed while it is recording (I say I do not believe because after 2 years, I am still learning how to fine tune the camera to maximize performance). I'm currently looking into buying an extra battery because I like taking a lot of videos (which does wear a little heavy on the battery if you're out shooting for several hours). But, if you're someone who just likes taking pictures, you can snap all day. For fun and battery saving, I like to turn off the LCD and shoot images through the eyehole (or whatever it is called, haha). Another thing, this camera is SMALL. People will not tend to believe you that you are able to produce such wonderful images with something of this size. The benefit of the size is that it can always go with you and it won't fill up your pocket as much as an iPhone or something of that size. I do recommend to ALWAYS use the wrist strap when shooting with this bad boy because its size does make it prone to fall out of your hand!I have taken this camera up and down the East Coast of the United States and Western Europe, might I say, I have yet to be disappointed.

I bought this at Walmart when it was on sale for $120 which was a steal. I use a 16G SD card which gives about 90 minutes of video recording in 720HD mode, and about 4 hours in standard. This camera takes gorgeous pictures and video. There are many lighting and color options. It takes video fairly well in low lighting. This camera is a  beautifully constructed work of art, and feels good to hold in your hands. There are two drawbacks for this camera. While it does have quality metal construction, if it were to fall onto concrete I believe it might break. Especially with the lens out. I always make sure I use the wrist strap when I am outdoors. The other drawback is the lack of zoom when filming video. The digital zoom can be used while recording but greatly reduces video quality. All other settings must be set before you start shooting video. This camera takes great pictures, and amazing video. It has a macro video mode which allows you to record things close up! I filmed a honey bee on a flower in macro mode and it captured amazing details I could not see with the naked eye. Excellent for macro video! If you are considering buying one, go to Youtube and look at all the video people made with this camera. You will be impressed! I would buy this camera again if I could find a good deal on it.

My main criteria were 1) it had to be VERY small; 2) it needed to take great still shots with high resolution; 3) I wanted HD video.1  This camera, is, indeed, VERY small.  So small that my little fingers have a hard time with the buttons sometimes.  This has not been too much of an issue, as I am now used to it.  The small size is a huge asset.2  I have received THOUSANDS of compliments on the photos I've taken with this camera.  Without editing, or with very simple cropping and retouching, this camera delivers high-quality photos, even set at medium resolution.  The number of settings give excellent functionality for all levels of photographers.  If you want a highly functional SMALL camera that takes great photos, this is it.3  The HD video is also really good but it takes up a lot of space on the memory card and takes a long time to upload anywhere.  I've used the next grade down and had fine results taking videos of sports events.Other plusses:  Battery life is amazing.Minuses:  over time, this camera has acted strange at times, especially with the opening and closing of the lens and with time between pressing the button and the flash activating.  While a simple \"restore factory settings\" usually got it back on track, this dysfunction was unsettling when I was in once in a lifetime situations I HAD to memorialize in photos.Finally, after probably 10,000 photos on the beach and in other grimy, humid conditions, the lens refuses to open all the way when I turn the camera on.  This problem can be fixed, but I'm being told that the fix will cost more than a new, better camera.  I'm bummed even though I think I've probably used this camera to death.Great camera.

I use it on full automatic setting as a point and shoot, and while the image quality is not quite up to LX-3 standards, it is pretty amazing.I recently was on Amelia Island and took a bicycle ride to the salt marsh.  I slipped the SD780 in my pocket (I can take this camera everywhere and anywhere since it is so tiny) and ended up taking a photo of the salt marsh that was so good, I had it enlarged and framed and hung up on my wall.  I am very, very picky about my photography and I never thought I would frame and hang an image taken from such a tiny camera.  The folks at the camera store could not believe this image came from the SD780.  So it has the capability of taking amazingly good images.Battery life is exceptional, much better than my LX-3.

Yes, it takes a blurry picture from time to time, but if you set the camera correctly (its really easy to do) your pictures will turn out great.  I use this camera for facebook/internet use and for printing normal size photos & find it works very well! And an added bonus - its actually a pretty tough camera.

Meanwhile, I was actually was looking to get a new camera, right before the incident, for I was getting tired of the bulk and older, slower features. Soon as I saw the 780is, I liked the sleek look and ultra-portability, combined with the 12mp and video capability, and It was a Canon, I was jazzed...but it had a 299.99 price tag, that busted the bubble. I said Canon's crazy, I'll wait until the price goes down when the new model comes out. (for those that don't know, a company's new model after a re-design usually is the same product with 1 or 2 extra features, nothing to trip over yourself for.)I patiently waited finally found one for under 170.00 and ordered it right up. Upon receiving the cam, my first thought was man it is small, I charged it up and started taking test shots against his replacement, the Olympus.Here's where the try before you buy is critical, The pics from the Canon were instantly noticeable being grainy and smaller detail was blown out. I thought it was broken, so I called the company and they sent me a replacement. I did notice something else that did disappoint me, both cameras I received were stamped Made In China...Yes, The Japanese brand and rep is now outsourcing to China...great.Sorry, and no offense, but so far, the quality of China goods I've received is not of the highest standards.The pic quality of this cam proves that and says it all- grainy and blurry for inside shots (retouching required) only the outside shots, both still and video, look awesome, but sound on the video is bad, too.After the initial disappointment faded, and I realized quality control is pretty much dead everywhere, I decided to keep the Canon, just for the quick point and shoot convenience. Not to mention that after 2 month of casual use, the paint on the body is wearing off in spots. If I had purchased it at the original price or anything higher than I paid, it would have gone right back.P/S. I did not retire the Olympus after purchasing the Canon as I intended, for its pic quality is superior.

I was about ready to automatically add the SD1200is to my Amazon cart until I hesitated for a second and decided to make a trip to Best Buy to play around with some of the other new cameras.  I had read reviews on the SD780 and was really eager to see it in person.  On the shelf, it automatically caught my eye with its sleek, black styling, and I was wondering if maybe it would be an even better companion than my trusty SD1100is was.Truth of the matter is that 12.1 megapixels isn't going to be much more apparent than 10.0 MP (what the SD1200is has,) but to be honest, I just flat-out fell in love with the styling of the SD780.  As someone who factors in a product's design and aesthetics almost as much as its functioning, this was a clear-cut and easy decision, but the SD780is isn't just about looks -- it delivers astonishing pictures as well!  I'm not a person who likes to fuss around with settings and menus (like on DSLR cameras,) but I still want nice pictures!  The simplicity of this camera is even more impressive than SD1100is, and the pictures are even sharper and more vibrant thanks to the DiG!C 4  image processor.  The \"Smart AUTO\" feature really is just \"Point and Shoot\" too!  Where there were certain settings to mess around with on my SD1100isThis camera makes perfect sense, really.  It's easy to carry with you, very easy to use, so the chances of capturing that \"picture perfect moment\" have increased considerably over other cameras.  The only thing that I am disappointed with seeing is \"Made in China\" on the bottom of the camera's casing.  I have always valued Canon products because the company has always made it a point to manufacture in state-of-the-art facilities.  I don't know how much a factor this is because a lot of people seem to have SD780s that were made in Japan, but be aware that at least some are made in China.", "Date": "March 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "truly pocketable camera for snapshots w/HD video, do NOT use included strap!!!", "Author": "Phong Ngo \"rantng\"", "ReviewID": "RNDMF9AJNM20G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The SD780IS is a great little point & shoot pocket camera. A surprising feature given its small size is the inclusion of a viewfinder. You'll find that most digicams these days leave this out and you're forced to use the LCD screen. It is a tiny viewfinder, but nevertheless, I appreciate that one is included. I was also surprised to find that there is a Program feature, which allows the user to choose ISO, White Balance scene mode, color settings, metering & shot modes. There are no aperture or shutter speed modes, but I'm guessing if you're looking at this camera that's not a problem. I own several digital cameras of varying cost and size, but I wanted a camera that I could toss in my bag or jacket and know that I was never without a camera (without the added bulk to remind me I was always carrying one), but at the same time took decent quality photos & video and this fit the bill. Make no mistake it won't take poster quality photos, but it will do in a pinch for snapshots and facebook/myspace, etc.Do NOT use the included wrist strap with this camera. The metal part of the strap will scrape the camera and remove the paint. I have had this camera for several months and kept it in pristine condition. The other day I put the strap on and it scraped the paint off the edge of the camera and left several shiny rub marks that could not be removed.

That I could take it into rock shows and get awesome photos and videos.  This camera ROCKS!! Simple enough.  Why?  Well I'm not really a camera expert so I can't give you all the specs but here is why I bought it and what makes it an awesome choice.-I wanted something fast enough with continious shooting.  I can use on the program mode at 800 or 1600 without a flash and still capture rock stars who tend to move around quickly in low or flashing light.-It had to be small and powerful--well this camera fit that bill better than any other.  The digital zoom works great.  It's like a real zoom.  I can shoot from the back of a venue and still get photos and video-HD video was a must b.c I love to put my videos on you tube  (cynsk8 is my page) and I have captured some amazing video of some heavy bands.  The video quality is perfect and the audio better than most of what I have seen out there by other non-professionals.-The auto mode had to be smart and flexible.  Which it is, I can shoot on auto with a flash at a rock show from the edge of the stage and capture shots that are as good as a large professional camera.  So much so that everyone asks me about my camera once they see the shots.-Sturdy, so far so good even in the middle of a mosh pit, I've gotten pretty tossled and had to close the lens on a moments notice and so far no issues.  I have been worried about this, but I trust that Canon has made the sturdiest little camera.-Useability, a touch screen control wouldn't work for me b.c I often cannot look down at the screen while I am adjusting the camera.  I can seemlessly switch between auto/program/video with a touch.  I can also turn off the flash without looking down.

First off, it is tiny and light weight, smaller than a deck of cards or a pack of cigarettes.  The LCD screen on the back is crisp, clear, and bright so you can see it even in daylight.  There is also a viewfinder should you prefer.  The camera has numerous settings for portrait, view and etc, and an automatic face finder which focuses on faces.  Because it is 12 megapixels, the clarity of the photos is amazing.  The lens pops out quickly, and there is a simple button at the top of the camera which allows you to bring objects in tight or wide.  I had actually been considering buying a big SLR (the Nikon D5000) which is nearly $800 and obviously does much more, but this little camera (which also shoots HD video) is so wonderful, I am beginning to doubt if I want the bigger one.

The Canon SD100 was the first of the digital elph cameras and at the time it was very small, sleek and had a relatively high (3.2MP) resolution for a camera that size.  Then, 10 years went by.. It took great pictures and was bulletbroof, I can't remember how many times I've dropped it in snow, mud, sand etc and the thing would not die!  So it was apparent that I needed a new camera, just by looking at friends photos they took with a modern point and shoot camera.I settled on the 780IS rather quickly, just going for the current $250-$300ish Canon elph.  12.1 MP is enough, can't see needing more than that for the next 10 years at least.  We'll see though.  I like how fast it powers up and the intuitive menu, that is still similar to my old SD100.  The picture quality so far is great, I've been using it for a lot of nature shots and I've found I don't have to use the saturation setting as much in photoshop. It is also much lighter than the SD100, so better for backpacking and snowboarding and biking and anything else where weight matters.

I use a Rebel XTi, and a Leica D Lux 3, so i'm not exactly using top grade shooters. I just like to have decent pictures is all.So, with that aside, I will say that this camera is absolutely excellent to just have on you at all times. If you are looking for insane DSLR quality pictures, obviously you should be looking elsewhere. For people who can deal with some noise here and there, its totally perfect. I'm not a camera buff that's going to nit-pick this camera. I am an average person that uses a camera everyday. Ease of use is great. Menu's, changing settings, video are all easably changable. Maybe someone with bigger hands might refute this, but it fits/feels fine in my hand.To be honest, the noise all the way up to 800 is actually pretty good. Again, it's NOT a high end point and shoot. But for $200, it out performs my Leica in the noise department.How often do you go above 800 anyway? I know even in the lowest of light, i'm either not using this camera if I want a printable shot, or you can set the exposure to be less, then set the flash settings accordingly and it's alright.AF is pretty quick, not say G11 fast. But with moving targets, a few days of practice should warrant you the abilities to feel comfortable of trying. This is probably the only draw back.  Then again, that's why I have a DSLR for action and artsy stuff.Overall, for a camera that is inexpensive, easy to you, and very light weight this is an awesome deal.

Morey", "ReviewID": "R2LGZC6HA6W3W2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Coming from an old Coolpix 2000 (but also owning a D200 and having used plenty of new digital cams), this camera is pretty darn impressive.  First, startup time, for a pocket camera it seems great to me, it's ready to go a lot faster than any pocket cam I've used.  Shutter lag is short, though focus speed indoors isn't all that impressive unless you're close and the illuminator works.  Usability wise, I'm a big guy with big hands, and I still found the camera to be pretty easy to operate.  Part of that may be from twiddling all the little buttons and dials on my D200, but I found it easy to use and very thoughtfully designed in both Auto and Program mode.The one big downer to this camera, I haven't personally tested it, but from several reviews is the battery life.  CIPA puts it at around 210 shots, and most sites get less than 250.  Being that this unit can't take standard batteries that could be an issue.  For me it's not that big of a deal, this is just an occasional shooter when I don't have the \"big\" camera with me, and I got a 2nd battery just in case.EDIT:  Having taken the camera to the Detroit auto show i can say that the battery life with the flash off is excellent.  I took around 150 shots and the battery indicator was still showing full.  I can only assume the sites and the CIPA test make extensive use of the flash.  The pictures the camera produced at the auto show really exceeded my expectations in pretty much every way.  My friend thought they were so much better than her husbands because I had used my digital SLR and she was shocked to find out the little Canon took them.  Everyone I've shown this camera is shocked by its size and image quality and assumes I must have spent hundreds on it.I wasn't that impressed by the video mode, but I don't really care about it and I didn't test it extensively.  For how tiny the camera is and how much else it does, it was still pretty impressive, but I'm not sure that \"HD\" video from this is much better than SD video from my miniDV camcorder.  I also found that indoors without flash the high ISO images get massively smeared by noise reduction.  This is the price you pay for a camera this tiny, and I expected it.  With the flash on the camera limits itself to ISO 250 and takes great pictures with plenty of detail.  The flashes reach is pretty weak though due to it's size, so if you want to take pictures of a whole room, like for a realtor or something, this isn't a good solution.  For taking pictures of a group of people relatively close in a dark room however, the flash should work great.  Even at higher ISOs if you're downsizing or printing on 4x6 type paper you shouldn't have much issue with the NR softness.Finally, to touch on size again, this camera is AMAZINGLY small.  We're talking deck of cards small, credit card covers it completely up small.  I knew it was small before I recieved it, but it's still shocking the first time you pick it up if you haven't used a real small camera before.  I wouldn't use this as a serious primary camera, but if you want something that still takes great pictures in most situations and can literally fit in a pocket, you can't go wrong with this camera.  I lusted after this camera on release due to the size vs performance, and finally got one and have to say, it lived up to my expectations and then some.  I'm normally a Nikon enthusiast but this camera is one of a number of examples of why Canon is the way to go in point and shoot cameras.", "Date": "December 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great for Product Photography", "Author": "Van", "ReviewID": "R34O66VR7J23O9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Once in a while I do something smart. This is one of them. I had been using my camera phone and an old Fuji camera which kept blurring out or had poor white balance. So I took the plunge and got a better camera. I was concerned because it was so small, but was lured in by it's slim and sexy design. I am so happy I did.This camera takes great indoor shots, it's a camera that works like a professional one when it comes to taking pictures of interior. Pictures shows dimension and depth. It's auto feature is nearly perfect and the manual feature help control the white balance which is really important for product photography. Now I can post on ebay without being embarrassed about appearing cheap. I can use regular lighting without being concerned of the yellowish tinge.People photography is fine as long as I'm not in it. Perhaps it's a little too clear. Personally I like the fuzzy haze that makes a person look sort of dreamy. But my intention wasn't for portrait photography so it wasn't a major concern.The video is like every other video camera, it's great it can record up to 60 mins to 120 mins on a 4gb memory card (sold separate). It doesn't zoom in too well without blurring out though. So I still need to invest in another video camera if I plan to ever zoom in super close.

It is absolutely miraculous what Canon has stuffed into this little package.  I am mostly interested in close-up photography of flowers, mushrooms, insects and other small subjects.  I also want a camera that can fit in my jeans pocket - this is it.  Usually I have to fiddle with settings to get the lighting/focus right, but this camera does an excellent job on FULL AUTO.  I've uploaded a couple of insect photos - take a look at those.Like all small cameras with a small flash, photos of subjects that are farther than about ten feet away don't always come out perfectly exposed - for this reason. I use the flash as infrequently as possible.  Within the limits of the flash, it does a good job of illuminating faces and objects and not overexposing.  It also achieves focus lock quickly - unlike other cameras I tested before purchasing this one.The metal case (I bought the red one) feels substantial and sturdy, not cheesy.  The buttons are small but I don't have any difficulty using them (I have average-sized female hands) but a big man might find it fumbly.  It is REALLY small - about the size of a Blackberry Phone - with rounded corners.  It slips easily into my front jeans pocket.The image stabilization works very well - it is very hard to shoot close-ups of plants and insects without some movement - this camera eliminates the fuzz.

It is real light and not a drag in my pocket when I'm wearing shorts or khaki pants.3) The LCD screen is good. 2.5 inch is more than you need to do quick reviews, deal with the settings, etc.4) The viewfinder is quite small but who uses that for point and shoot cameras anyway.5) Buttons - no problems with using the buttons or the zoom knob. I have large hands and can navigate pretty easy.6) Quiet - the motor is noticeably quieter than my old Canon SD600.7) Picture quality - excellent as always. I tend to shoot in normal mode with either 12 or 8MP and the quality looks great. This is a point and shoot so you are not going to get vibrant pictures as you do with a DSLR. However the quality is real good so I have no complaints here.8) Zoom - I like the 3x zoom. No problems. I think the digital zoom is okay but then it's not always good on any point and shoot.Video review:1) Great video. It outputs in 720P HD quality. Nice look and feel when viewing on a computer or on tv. HDMI port is a bonus on the camera.2) Only drawback is you can't optically zoom while filming. But then think about the size of the camera - so plan your shots accordingly before filming. You'll get good video clips for the web to share. Not going to produce an oscar-winning film with this :)Overall:What else can I or anyone else say? Great camera for all the features offered for $220. I love the color, red, too.

Problems I encountered with the SD780is are (1) that the door/piece/cover that covers where the battery and SD card are inserted was loose.  It shifted/wiggled/moved every time I took a picture, just a little bit but enough to be annoying and unacceptable in an almost-$300 point-and-shoot camera.

(2) Second, the HD video was a primary reason that I bought the SD780is instead of SD1200is, but when I viewed the HD video on my computers it consistently had a line/defect/artifact? through the video-not good. (3) Third, at one point the 780 camera screen didn't seem to turn on and function when I hit the power button, though later at the store it did turn on for the salesperson, so I'm not sure how to explain this unusual event.

She got the SD1000 while I ended up with the SD 780 IS.I would have purchased this camera locally, but the color options were limited to bright red and solid black, neither of which was appealing to me or where I would use the camera.As with the SD1000, I used my camera on a self made camera mount on my scooter - a 2006 Honda Metropolitan.

Canon REALLY needs to work out a better product numbering scheme. It takes me a while to figure out the differences between various models.Image Quality:- Excellent picture quality using auto mode in well lit settings. Fair picture quality in high ISO low light situation, which is expected for a compact point and shoot camera.- The smart auto mode automatically detect the setting, for example, back light situation. It works so well that I no longer use the manual mode even though I'm fairly comfortable with setting various modes due to my experience with digital SLRs.- The 720p HD movie mode delivers very good quality HD video, up to 70 minutes on a 16GB card.- With a under water enclosure Canon WP-DC31 Waterproof Case for SD780IS Digital Elph Camera, it takes great under water pictures and videos.Built Quality:- Despite its small size, the SD780IS feels solid in hand. All buttons and controls have the right amount of tactile feedback force.- The only minor issue is the battery/memory door feels a bit flimsy and need a bit of attention when closing to avoid mis-latch.Features:- Super slim and stylish body/color.- Very fast turn on time. A useful little feature: press Play button directly turns the camera on with lens retracted, great for showing pictures/movies to family and friends.- Smart auto mode works great.- Face detection is amazingly accurate, and is very useful for taking people shots.- Lack of panoramic mode is a major draw back, comparing to SD700IS.Comparing to other models:- Smaller than SD960IS Canon PowerShot SD960IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.8-inch LCD (Silver), almost the same feature except 3X zoom vs 4x zoom. I recommend choosing this over SD960IS.- From the specification, the newer SD940IS Canon PowerShot SD940IS 12.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-inch LCD (Black) is almost identical with SD780IS, but with wider angle lens and 4x optical zoom. If you don't mind the extra $50, I think it is a better buy.Summary:Pros: Image quality, HD video, slim sizeCons: Lack panoramic mode, less wide angle and optical zoom than SD940IS.Overall, SD780IS is a rare combination of high quality engineering and stylish design.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Slow camera 0.8fps:(", "Author": "Patrick Nguyen \"Trance Music\"", "ReviewID": "R2N0GFW3OQ5G6P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had Canon SD790IS and Canon SD1200IS before, this camera looks much nicer and sexier, but the preform of this camera is not as good as Canon SD 1200 IS.

I made this choice against several Panasonic and Sony point & shoot cameras after seeing the large number of positive user reviews this model received in Amazon. I currently own a Nikon DSLR(D40) with couple of additional lens. And hence I would be comparing this model with my DSLR for picture quality.I got the silver colour as the black did not seem impressive in the Amazon online product gallery (but i later saw a review from one of the user that black is indeed beautiful). After I opened the box and got the camera to the hand, the feeling was really great!, it felt very tiny and light weight, but I quickly became curious to know how is thing camera going to perform in picture quality - the main purpose we buy a camera for. I put in a 2 GB card quickly and started taking few pictures inside the room. The pictures came out grainy, even with flash - which was disappointing. The quality of pictures were not near the entry level DSLR or even bigger cousins (Powershot, 200$ and above models) from Canon. The reason could be smaller size of lens and sensor in this camera. The lack of manual mode or wide angle would not bother me as long as a camera can take really good photos at normal zoom (group of people, face, building etc)  which is where we use P&S; cameras 90% of the time. For me good picture quality in all modes (outdoor/indoor/night) stands as the primary reason for choosing a camera. While this camera can be great as a light weight travel camera for casual photography - I would suggest to go with a slightly higher end (with bigger aperture lens) model from Canon or Panasonic (Canon SX120IS around 200$ or Canon S90), you dont need fancier ones) .

There are many reviews here that go pretty in depth so I'll keep it simple.Obviously the form factor is excellent.  This camera is very compact.  Manual settings are pretty good for a camera in this class and the HDMI output is nice.But I bought this first and foremost as a point-and-shoot to replace an old 3.2 MP Sony.  This Canon could not match the 6 year old Sony in sharpness, color, or low light.  Very disappointing.  All the pictures were soft and grainy, the auto flash never seemed to come on when it needed to (and you can't force it on in auto mode), the focus was inconsistent, and the color often had an orange hue and was oversaturated.  I really don't understand how anybody could give this camera good ratings for picture quality.  Perhaps the same people who watch their TVs in \"Vivid\" mode or are making comparisons to a camera phone.  It can take OK pictures if you fiddle around with manual settings each and every time, but this defeats the purpose of a point-and-shoot. Most of my pictures are indoors. Outdoors this camera does perform better.  But so do most cameras.Video is OK for a camera I guess, but no match for my standard-def camcorder.It's pretty clear to me that a 12.1 MP sensor in a camera with this small of a lens does nothing except create unnecessarily large files.  As I already mentioned, the picture quality was actually less than my old 3.2 camera.  I know that may sound like I am exaggerating, but I compared them side by side and it was easy to see even to my untrained eyes.I replaced this camera with another Sony, a DSC-W290.  The Sony simply takes much better pictures with less hassle.  Only downsides are the physical size and the proprietary Memory Stick.

But it also has a manual mode for those that know what they are doing and feel the need to be creative. As a bonus there is a video mode so you can shoot video and upload to you tube. It is small. If there is a downside to the camera, it is the size. If you have large hands/fingers it may be a little difficult to navigate some of the controls. I got used to it.

Luckily, they were kind and brought it to me.  I opened it and it was beautiful!!  Described precisely in the ad!  I took some test pictures and they were beautiful!  Well, when I 1st took it out, I was holy crud, look at the size of that thing!  It's SO tiny!  I thought my Sony Handycam was small!  It's about the size of a deck of cards... amazing!I was very glad it came with everything it said.  I looked through the package and said \"O my gosh, they didn't include a memory card!\"  But then I reviewed the ad and it said it didn't so I am surely not holding that up against you.I am extremely happy with all the features on it.  The pictures are BEAUTIFUL!  The video is pretty dang good, but the sound recorder isn't good.  But I don't care because I bought it for the pictures.I am happy that it will fit my tripod so I don't have to hold it ALL the time.I did order a memory card and popped it in and used it and it was very very nice.Very compact, easy to use, figured it out without a manual within 15 minutes.One thing to beware of - this will NOT save pictures unless you have a memory card.  It has absolutely no internal memory.  But I don't mind because I don't need it.  I was just used to my handycam which has 8 gb of internal memory for videos and stills.Thank you very much AV26INC for a beautiful camera for very cheap and keeping your word!  I give this a 5 star rating and I would recommend this camera to everyone and say to buy it from AV26INC.

When I got it back the second time, they did not fix either problem and they broke something inside the camera so a red spot kept appearing on the LCD when trying to take a picture or shoot video... I sent it in a third last week telling them to fix the problems they caused and to replace the LCD.It returned today, they fixed the two problems they caused, but I still have the dead pixel.The bottom line is Canon is a horrible company when it comes to repair service, if you get a defective LCD like I did, you are going to have to deal with it, because they will lie to you about trying to repair and do nothing.Either Canon lacks integrity or their repair people are incompetent or both (probably both) and thus I have to poorly review their product, because if something else goes defective, I have no guaranteed they will be able to fix it.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Canon Camera", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R2Z9KVTRKNCWUM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is an amazing value for the money.

Then I noticed that the SD780is shoots video in HD where others in it's price range did not. I no longer shoot a lot of video but figured this camera might be able to do both.

My daughter had an older version of this camera and loved it, and the reviews on line were really good, so I bought it. Well, the size is definitely a plus. It is nice and small and fits easily into my small purse, even with the case I bought with it. Without the case, it can fit into my jeans pocket. However I am very disappointed in the video part of the camera. I realize it takes HD video, and that HD takes up more space and takes longer to upload, so I turned the HD off, since I mostly want my video clips for uploading onto the computer and do not care if they are in HD or not, but even lowering the size, it takes SO LONG to upload even the shortest video clip (1-1 1/2 min. clip takes a good 8-10 min or longer to upload) that its almost not worth it. Taking videos also totally drains the batteries. I bought a second battery, that I keep with me all the time. Since I love taking videos of my grandson to send to relatives on the computer, unfortunately this camera is not really what I want it to do. So unless I am doing something wrong when I am uploading (don't know how I could possibly be tho!) then I am disappointed in that part. As for the digital pictures though, they are great. So I will most likely keep the camera. Now I am looking at possibly buying myself a small video camera to supplement this camera.

Then again, you wouldn't want any point-and-shoot as your only camera.  On the other hand, if you need something to take on vacation, or something to have in your back pocket when you are outside with your kids and don't want to miss anything, or are looking for an alternative to Flip, you can't go wrong with the SD780.Already an owner of a large DSLR coupled with a heavy lens, I was looking for something that would 1) produce acceptable pictures under regular conditions, 2) replace a Flip cam for shooting video, 3) always stay in the pocket in that unassuming way a good cell phone does, and 4) cost under $300.  I've looked at and tried pretty much the entire Digital Elph line-up, and also seriously considered a Lumix because of their awesome wide angle lenses, but ultimately decided SD 780 was pretty much what I needed.I've owned the camera for a couple of weeks, and here are some first impressions.1) The video is great -- much better than the old non-HD Flip. It seems that I shake the camera more than Flip because of its design, but, and that was a nice surprise since you can't see it in the product shots, the Elph has a tripod mount.  The file sizes are an order of magnitude larger, however, so stock up on a decent and fast (class 6) memory card right here on Amazon for about $15 for 8 Gigs.2) The image quality is what you would expect from a camera of this class. Pictures are great in a perfect light, and not so great in all other light conditions. I haven't seen a point-and-shoot that performs otherwise.3) Given a choice between a couple of random extra features and smaller size, I would always go for the size. None of these extras make your pictures look significantly better, but a constantly bulging pocket is a major annoyance. This camera is very small. I have large hands (I'm 6'2\"), and the small buttons haven't been a problem. The camera is also very pleasant to hold and look at.4) Fast start-up time. Shutter lag is ok. There are other point-and-shoot cameras with much higher frame-per-second numbers. If you are considering one of those pocket-sized Lumix cameras, Lumix are slower.5) The other non-Elph camera I looked at was a Canon Powershot SX10IS with the crazy 20x optical zoom (28-560mm equivalent). The SX10IS is bigger, more expensive, and doesn't have HD video, but if you are into stuff that requires powerful zoom, SD780 won't cut it.On the downside, the lack of manual controls is a complete waste.  Also, does anyone ever use that tiny optical viewfinder on this thing? And why can't they name their cameras in a way that doesn't remind an alphanumerical soup?Overall, SD780 is great at what it's been designed to do. Manual controls and even a slightly wider lens would've earned it five stars in its class.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "SD780IS Review", "Author": "Shawn Cheng \"Shawnye\"", "ReviewID": "RT3ZKYLSKEKQ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has been great.

It replaces my older powershot for photos and I can take decent HD videos too that I can immediately play back on my 52\" Samsung HDTV. I found indoor low light performance to be quite acceptable with some graininess. Mind you my old 8mm camcorder's video quality is better than the HD video from this camera but the pros outweigh the cons. The one area where I see lots of room for improvement is when the video blurs as you move the camera itself quickly. Very slow movement is OK. The 12 megapixel pics are great but I expect them to be anyway. I'm taking a lot of videos now because its fun, super convenient, form factor is not at all intimidating and I can play back, record, upload with ease. It was funny though to see this very tiny camera perched on top of my big tripod at a recent family event. The 2-in-1 camera/camcorder convergence is a must have for me. I just could never lug around a camcorder in addition to a camera.

In spite of its tiny size, the SD780 has one.  Moreover, it has every other feature that a true camera lover could want--HD video (with decent audio), complete automation or, if you prefer, a generous selection of settings from which the user can choose to match virtually any subject under any lighting conditions.  When the form-fitting camera especially designed for the SD780 is ordered Canon PSC-1050 Deluxe Leather Case (Red).  What it's lacking--internet and social connectivity--is, for some of us, another reason to prefer this camera over any \"smart phone\" (I simply can't take seriously a camera that looks like a driver's license or credit card.  Treat this camera nicely, and it'll return the favor for another 5-10 years.]Original review:  Canon released its new line into a tough market with economic hard times and a glut of consumer hand-held devices, so if you can resist all the graduation and Father's Day hype, this one, like its predecessor the SD770, is likely to come down in price (same for the SD1200).  For those who like the practicality and convenience of a slightly larger camera offering more aspect ratios, the SD880 and SD890 are understandably better bets.  Wide angle lenses may not excite some consumers as much as a zoom lens, but they're far more practical for tight framing of group shots, not to mention insuring the mic picks up dialog during videos.But the SD780 is a camera where looks, though not the only thing, aren't far from being the main thing.  The camera feels even smaller than its listed dimensions and weight; the carton it comes in is 3/5 the size of the box for its predecessor, the SD770.  And just compare the surfaces of these two cameras: not a speck of space is wasted on the SD780, making the viewfinder a bit slower to deploy and the flash slightly less powerful than either of these features on the SD770.  But no question that, assuming you don't miss the classic Canon squared-off look, the SD780 is a sexy-looking, stealthy (especially in black) point 'n shooter that's as aesthetically pleasing and as well designed as an iPod Nano  (just be careful not to put either device into a pants pocket without first checking for holes).  As for size, my Sony Cybershot U-10 is fatter but 30 percent smaller overall than the SD780, so best to regard this one not as the smallest camera but the smallest Canon.Initial impressions of the shots are favorable. The ones from my Canon PowerShot model with a mere 3.2 megapixel lens set up faster and strike me as more natural, but I'd hate to crop or enlarge any of them.  The SD780 invites the user to exercise patience as well as creativity in order to get the most from its extreme miniaturization.  I haven't tried attaching an HDMI cable to this pint-sized overachiever as yet, but I expect to do so and return to this review in the near future, hopefully with some sort of assurance that carrying this little marvel will save you the trouble of bringing along a Flip to your granddaughter's ballet recital or son's Little League game.", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beware price gougers!", "Author": "Micah", "ReviewID": "RXAPS97PH58HA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera sold for one hundred fifty new, yet some crazy fools are trying to sell to unwitting customers for three times that or more.

The listed weights don't back me up, but it felt like it weighed more than the sd1200 in my pocket.- Resolution - despite being rated 12 megapixels, I got slightly *less* detail out of it in sunny conditions than I got out of my 5 megapixel kodak point and shoot that I bought 5 years ago for like [...].- Things in the middle of a picture have the same detail as my 5mp kodak, but things around the edges are notably fuzzier and blurrier.- Got a couple of out of focus shots even in bright daylight- To be fair, it did do better in low light than my kodak, taking clearer and more color-accurate shots than my kodak in my apartment with the lights on.If you've read the Consumer Reports review, it suggested this camera had really good ISO (low light perfomance). It's rather misleading. I bought this camera hoping it had really good night shots - they were just as crap-tastic as other point and shoots that fit in your pocket. Even with lighting directly above them, I could not get a non-blurry picture of my friends at night without a flash. If I used a flash, it tended to give me the typical \"faces way white and washed out\" look.I noticed while noise is technically well controlled, what happens is that the darker and higher the iso for the shot, the more smudgy and less detailed the photo gets. I mean, I thought they did a nice job at it - I didn't get that \"lots of noise\" look to my darker photos. But those photos also clearly lost some resolution.If you're looking for resolution in your photos from the 12mp rating, or are excited about the supposed high ISO rating, this camera will be a disappointment. Even buying just a *slightly* larger camera like the SD1200 will likely (based on my shots + online sample photos) give you more resolution and slightly better low light performance, though the noise removal on this camera is pretty nice (perhaps the sd1200 will get replaced with a camera with the same processor as this one) but results in reduced resolution rather than additional noise in your photo. If you just want a tiny point and shoot to take pics to put on facebook, this camera is a very nice option.

Overall the camera works well and the small viewfinder is handy if it's too bright outside to see the screen.  The small size of the camera (smaller than a deck of cards) was great per she tucks it into her jean's pocket to carry it. The camera has a minimal lag time to take a photo and repeat shots.  Overall the picture quality is good and the camera had high ratings by an independent consumer research agency.The biggest annoyance is that when downloading pictures to your computer it saves all of the pictures by date. For example, all of the pictures you took on 5/18/2010 will be in one folder, then all of the pictures you took on 5/19, 5/20 and 5/21 will all be in their own separate own file folders. It would be far easier have the option to group all of the photo's together into one event (i.e. May 2010 trip to beach)  To correct you then have to go into windows manager and re-categories/re-arrange the photo's.  The operating manual suggests that this might be able to be changed but it is not easy to do if it is at all.The second biggest annoyance is that you cannot upload photos directly from the camera to a website like I-photo or [...]. The software forces you to first download the photo's to your PC then upload them to the website, unless you use Cannon's own photo website. To circumvent this we tried to take the SDHC card out of the camera and put it into the combo disk drive on our computer to upload the photos from the drive to the internet. We were unable to do this, not sure if it's the drive that malfunctioning or if the camera somehow prevents you from doing this by the format is saves the pictures in.Overall, great compact camera and I think it was good for the price we paid.

But at least you can print out the photos yourself on a Canon Pixma and nobody has to look at that creature you call a kid.It's just a damn good camera.Postscript: The video is definitely grainy in darker settings. Grainier than a non-HD Flip camera I have. But in the daytime or well lighted rooms? Crisp man. Like a good pilsner.Postscript #2: It's now 6 months later and I lost my camera in some scrub brush while riding drunk on a 4-wheeler. So.... I decided to upgrade to the SD1400is. It's basically  the same camera only very slightly bigger and has two extra camera modes (fishbowl and miniature). I've noticed photos, esp at night, come out better with the 1400is, but it might just be me. If both are the same price, I'd get the 1400is but I wouldn't pay too much more for it.", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Ean E.", "ReviewID": "R2H61YEQGVA56G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just go to auto mode and shoot away.

But I knew I needed something to capture my daughter's moments. So far, I've been suffering through using the standard dev video on my Panasonic point and shoot which hasn't been a bad experience, but the video quality can get quite dismal. So I started shopping for the new compact \"pocket\" camcorders ala Flip Mino HD and Creative Vado HD. After days of procrastination, ordered up a Vado for larger hard drive size, larger viewing screen, and cheaper price. Then I learned that the new point and shoots produce HD video. After cursing myself for my failed research, I went down to Best Buy and picked up the Canon SD780. I didn't think I would keep the Canon just because I didn't need another point and shoot but once I did a side by side video comparison with the Vado, it was a no brainer. The video colors from the Canon were more vibrant especially in lower light. The Canon also picked up sound much much better than the Vado which made people sound like they were far and tinny. In the end, the Canon won out and I have absolutely no regrets. It fits in the pocket nicely and is easy to manage. The still pictures are high quality Canon photos and having the still picture functionality is just an added bonus for me.", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Look elsewhere.

Also, resolution could be better at a distance, oddly enough, though the Macro function provides great resolution up close.  Many of these issues could probably be fixed by anyone willing to take the time to really work with the camera, but if you're like me - looking for a point-and-shoot camera - you don't want to take that time or trouble.  My previous Powershot was more lazy-friendly in that respect.This camera does earn serious points for incredible battery life, even on non-Canon batteries, and for shockingly good HD video!  I had no expectations for that feature, and have been blown away by how nicely it films.  The audio isn't even bad.  I use a four year old full-size Sony digital camcorder to film behavior in the lab, but may switch over to using this camera instead - it's really that good.Finally, as others have already pointed out, it's ridiculously portable.  I haven't even scratched the screen yet, which is impressive, as I've carried it everywhere for about six months.  All-in-all, 4.5/5 stars.

As many reviewers noted the ultimate picture quality is worse than 4 megapixel Canon cameras of yore. Not a single picture I took was sharp, both in auto and manual modes. Digital noise is horrible at any ISO setting but 80. Considering the fact that this camera has an aperture of 3.2, the ISO 80 can only be used at bright daylight or with flash at close-up. I suspect that the absence of sharpness is due to very aggressive noise reduction algorithms combined with small sized ridiculously high 12 megapixel sensor in this camera. These algorithms make any backlight shot intolerably bad, mangling facial features beyond recognition. If Canon used a 6-8 megapixel sensor, the quality would have been way, way better.Compared to Canon S90 this camera is a joke.

Here's my likes and dislikes about it:Positives:-Good HD video quality outdoors.-Small form factor - very pocketable.-Acceptable image quality outdoors of non-moving subjects.Negatives:-Recorded audio has a lot of issues - there's a constant background hum. It also has very short but noticeable interruptions for no apparent reason.-You will cover the microphone 70% of the time and therefore the audio will be extremely muted (unusable) with a loud hum noise over.-No zoom or focus re-adjustment during video shooting. If you want to zoom, you will need to stop the shooting, zoom and start shooting again. However, my camera did occasionally zoom while shooting video. I have no idea why...-Blurry pictures unless taken under the sun. Indoors pictures without flash are always blurry even if you have very stable hands. Picture sharpness is an issue overall.-Buttons are hard to identify and press without looking at them because they are too tiny and flush with the surface.-It's difficult to hold the camera because it is not only small and slippery but also no structural features to enable a good grab.-Poor battery life - about 100 shots.-Image stabilization is practically ineffective/useless no matter what setting you choose.-Flash is too harsh, generally results in overexposed areas in the picture.-Automatic white balance is very slow to make any changes.-This is a highly pocketable camera but when you carry it in your pocket, dust makes its way into the lense. I had to have the camera lense cleaned up 2 times in 2 years. Poor construction may have something to do with it. I have used many Canon's but this is my first \"Made in China\" Canon...-Optical zoom is almost unusable because picture becomes very blurry and unacceptable. This is more prominent with video.-There are only 2 settings for image quality: Fine and Normal. They removed Superfine in this one. However, there's not much difference between fine and normal other than the file size.Overall the older SD1000 takes better quality images even without the image stabilizer.

This camera is tiny, thin, truly ultracompact.  The best features to my mind are that it focuses quickly; I love the face-recognition feature that helps with focusing; and it's low-light function and incredible zoom abilities blew my mind.In addition to taking lots of pictures of people amidst complicated scenes, we spent time photographing cathedrals, which were both dark and detailed.  This camera on the highest quality setting really did the trick.  I ended up using it almost like a set of binoculars to examine the details of stained glass and statues later.Three quick caveats:  First, I have not fully explored the video function, which on first glance looks pretty good using the highest quality setting.  Second, the shutter button is in a slightly awkward spot, but I got used to it.  Third, the brushed-silver finish quickly started to discolor a bit where my fingers wrapped around on the front.Overall though, this camera provides incredible function and value.

At first it was barely noticeable - in fact it was only after it became unmistakable that I reviewed earlier photos and saw dust blobs there too.  For un-zoomed pictures, this dust results in a slight haze.  But for zoomed-in pictures, there are mysterious dark blobs all over the photo.  I spoke with the local camera repair shop about getting the optics cleaned, and they explained that the optics assembly is a single part and that Canon will not supply them with the necessary calibration software.  The only option was a one-size-fixes-all price of $119, plus shipping both ways.  Since I can get a whole new SD780IS for $145 with free shipping, having the camera repaired at that price makes no sense at all.  Plus, it would still be prone to dust gunking up the internal optics.So instead of repairing or replacing it with a new SD780IS, I'm going with a waterproof point-n-shoot (Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS2).  Much more expensive, but hopefully I'll have a camera that lasts longer than 12 months.", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "a bit disapointed with image quality", "Author": "D.

Certainly turned out to be the best bang for the buck I could find in an under-$200 point-and-shoot.  My parents live on the Canon brand, and it shows in their love for this one.  Of course, brand loyalty aside, this is their second PowerShot.  They had one from about six or seven years ago, which was one which used a Compact Flash card, had no optical zoom, had only 3.1MP quality, and ran on AA batteries, and it was NOT very user-friendly.  This camera really changed that big time.  Definitely a great choice for senior citizens to get into digital photography with.I wasn't about to look for a $1000 SLR with all these professional tools that they didn't know how to use, but didn't want such a cheap camera, that they'd complain after only a few times using it.  This was right in the middle, it was not a cheap camera with lack of features, but it wasn't so profesional SLR that they wouldn't know how to use, either.  This is a GREAT beginner's camera where you get features that you're going to use, and the simplicity that anyone from 8 to 108 can use.  Picture quality is a blast, took a picture of our cat a couple of times, and printed out in full 8x11.5\" with great quality.  My family chooses Canon for a reason, I was this close to getting them a comparable Kodak EasyShare, but glad I ultimately chose this PowerShot instead for them.", "Date": "January 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "AWESOME product", "Author": "Alexander E.

It is extremely small but has a nice overall feel of quality and looks pretty cool. One gripe I have with the built is that the camera/memory card door is a bit flimsy and seems to be made of cheap plastic in stark contrast to the rest of the body. It wobbles slightly which may be minor for some, but it was enough to bother me.I have small hands but this camera seems almost a bit too small at the expense of usability. The position of the flash is annoying and if you don't remember to keep your fingers well out of its range you'll cast dark shadows onto the picture. Some buttons are so tiny that you need to use your finger nail to push them.But what ultimately made me return this camera is the soft focus, even in bright sunlight. Since the zoom is very modest I thought that the large number of megapixels would allow me to crop liberally. Unfortunately, this is not possible due to the soft focus and frequent purple fringing. I prefer sharp crisp images but was not able to find a setting which would please me.The video is great if you don't point at a light source, but that feature alone was not enough to make up for the disappointing image quality.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Compact and nice featured camera", "Author": "Mark Twain", "ReviewID": "R1Q740OBSWUI3J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I was shopping for a new camera, the wish list included a small camera with good photo quality, HD video capability, and good performance on auto mode (I prefer not to get deep into camera settings).

The size is small and it is light so I always put my hand into the camera strap to make sure I don't drop it.

Having had other Canon cameras over the years including my current 50D, I am familiar with the quality of the Canon product.This camera has everything my wife wanted. It's small, it's red, it's stylish, it's red, it's cute, it's red, it has very few manual controls, it's red, Canon sells a nice leather case to fit it which is red, oh and did I mention it's red?That's about where the good stuff ends. I should say the camera appears to be well built. It is totally a point and shoot camera as there are no manual controls to speak of. This is all fine if that is what you want.The big problem is that picture quality is absolutely horrible. Anything over ISO 200 is worthless as the pictures are very noisy and grainy. In Auto mode, ISO is automatic and not user changeable. Using the underpowered flash, the camera picked ISO 640 which rendered a picture that was full of visable noise and artifacts. Outside in the bright sun, it picked ISO 400 which is borderline of the camera's limits.Doing some testing in P mode. I did some sample shots using ISO 80, 100, 200 and on up. If using ISO 80 or 100 and the flash, your range is about 7 feet max. With this combination, the pictures were relatively noise free. For any distance over 7 feet though, the pictures are way underexposed at those ISOs. You must bump ISO up to 400 or more and then noise becomes an issue again.Comparing the output of this camera to the old 4mp A85, the A85 blows this camera away. Looking at similar shots, the A85 produces relatively noise free pictures which are well exposed and saturated. The SD780's pictures are noisy and lack the saturation and contrast of the A85.This camera may be ok for outdoor shots on a bright day where you can manually keep ISO below 400 but indoors and using the flash the camera will be marginal at best and only good for snapshots at 4x5. Forget about 12 megapixels. Unfortunately, this has become a big selling point that is meaningless for point and shoot cameras. Actually, more megapixels is a detriment with these cameras. Current technology is not good enough to pack that many pixels into such a small area without introducing tons of noise. The pictures produced by these 12 megapixel cameras are so noisy that you can't blow them up any larger then their default 4x5 because the quality so bad. If they took this same camera, lowered the sensor to 6 megapixel, and then had you compare the output of 6 and 12, you would be amazed at how much better the lower pixel count looked.In any case, this camera has one big pro, it's red!!!EDIT***********I just wasn't comfortable with the camera as most reviews are rather good and I wasn't happy with it.

Let me explain:Let's imagine I have it in my pocket and I walk down the street and I see something interesting I want to take a picture of? With Sony T20 I reach into my pocket and by the time I get it to my eye level I have already slid the cover turning the camera on and it's fully operational, I am ready to take a picture.If I need to use the zoom,it's fast and responsive.With canon: I reach into my pocket, I have to look at the camera to find the power button which is not raised and is also the same color as the rest of the background. 2-3 sec later I locate the button and now I need to press with my nail on it to turn it on. Very hard to do because it's also very small! Now I have to wait another 2-3 seconds for the thing to boot up. Then I have to wait for it to focus another 1-2 sec, the it tries to detect the scene ( I always leave my cameras in auto mode in case I need to take a picture fast and I have no time to play with settings). Scene detection doesn't work on this camera very well,so it will take another 2-3 sec until it just decides to switch back to auto mode. If you need to use zoom, after each zoom adjustment it needs to start the whole focusing and scene detection again. So on average it might take you around 15 sec to take a shot!  Yesterday, I was walking in the park and this amazingly hot girl ran by me in booty shorts. Naturally I wanted to snap a picture of that. By the time I got the cam to be operational she was getting further away from. I decided to use zoom ( which is only 3x) but the camera could not focus on her body as she was running away from me. And that's when I decided to return this camera! The intelligent scene detection is a joke! I took about 200 pictures in different environments and it almost never detected the right scene. I only see it detecting macro consistently but it also detects macro when you try to take a picture thru the window glass. Of course you get a picture of the glass and not of what's outside. I took pictures inside my room using different lighting,outside also with different lighting conditions, the intelligent scene detection does more harm than good. I'll never forget how my camera decided to use flash on a bright sunny day when I was taking a pictures of the mountains miles away! wow!One of selling points of this cam was HD video. It looks good if there's enough lighting,but under any other conditions it's grainy with way more noise that any sony camera has. If you don't have a mac computer you will most likely not be able to play videos anyway. My pc computer which has no problem playing latest 3d games like \"Crisis\" and also having an ATI HD video card could not handle the video from this camera. I don't understand why would Canon decided to use Apples MOV format? Basically if you have a PC, you are not going to able to edit or even play videos.  The zoom on this camera is really slow too. The lag is about a second between you pressing on the lever and anything happening,then of course the cam needs another 2 seconds to focus. Whe it does start to move it moves way too fast,so you have to go back and forth before finding the right setting. Forget about taking pictures fast when you need it. Also the optical zoom is disabled when shooting movies, and if you use digital...hm..let's just say the tiny 12 mega pixel sensor is not going to perform well. Just use your cell phone camera and you probably going to get a better picture! After about two weeks, the lsd screen started losing pixels, so about 25 of them are gone already.To sum it up: extremely slow, hard to operate forget about movies unless you got a mac comp. zoom is slow the intelligent scene detection doesn't work at all! noise in pictures and movies lcd failed before 30 days.ask me questions, I'll keep it until next Monday when my new Sony t90 comes in.", "Date": "May 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "\"Memory Card Error\"", "Author": "N.
