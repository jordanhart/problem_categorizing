{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Poor closeup focus", "Author": "Mike S.", "ReviewID": "R21L1Y1WK1A488", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It depends on what you're using this for, but if you want to look for small defects like a small crack on the surface this isn't the camera to use.When it gets too close to the item (1\"?) there is no detail and it's out of focus. Sometimes turning the light down helps a little, which makes the picture grainy.The monitor is also not the greatest resolution for finding tiny faults, but you can connect it to a bigger TV if you can find the right cable (not included).It comes with a cube type wall charger for the monitor (TV) portion. It doesn't charge the camera/light pistol assembly which takes 4 AA batteries (not included).For anything that you don't have to look at very closely, this is a good deal. The pictures are good with the adjustable brightness on the LED.The wireless works perfectly so you can move the handle however you need to, watching the monitor wherever it's convenient to put it.Comes with a nice box that makes it easy to put away.A good deal for the price depending on what you need to see.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can be bought elsewhere cheaper", "Author": "G.
