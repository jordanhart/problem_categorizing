{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "N. Roque", "ReviewID": "R273PVAGNZI0T3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We had the TG-830 12 MP for 4 years, until it leaked. We had that camera under water all the time, and thought it lasted a very long time, considering the usage. I was very happy with it, and love this one even more! It has a scene feature, where you can set it up for \"indoor lighting,\" etc., that works very well. It also takes great video, with the press of a button. I find it very easy to use, and am super happy with my purchase. I also found that they improved on the weight of the camera. This one is LIGHTER than the 12 mp pervious version. You will be very happy you bought it! We go to Disney, water parks, the zoo in the rain, basically anywhere with it, and never have to worry about water ruining it!", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$289.99", "Features": null, "Name": "Olympus TG-830 iHS STYLUS Tough 16 MP 1080p HD Digital Camera Blue 8GB Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FmZHdc8HL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BMWSCCI"}}
