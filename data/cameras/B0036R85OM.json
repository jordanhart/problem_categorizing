Rice \"PWC\"", "ReviewID": "RNTB013P54MGM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was very surprised by this little camera. I won it in an auction and didn't think much of it until I actually played with it.Cool features include*Iso adjustment up to 3200*Smile shutter*HD video*Custom color effect editor*Smart filter for special effects in picture AND video mode*Continuous shot*More effects that can be added in playback modeAnother cool thing if that you can register a face and it marks the face every time you take a picture of that person. That may link to the software but I run linux so I don't know.The zoom and focus is very loud, at first I thought it was defective because of all the ticking noises but that is normal. In video mode the default is no sound on zoom because it's a horrid noise but you can turn it on although you really don't want to, trust me it sounds awful.The picture quality is about normal. I'll rarely shoot 12mp, maybe 3 or 5mp max ever so it doesn't look the greatest there on the tiny sensor but for snapshots it's awesome.Overall this is a great little camera. All the little editing effects add a nice touch for teens and adults who don't know how to edit on a computer or don't want to spend the time doing it.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Compact Camera for the Price and Size", "Author": "Greg Shovlin", "ReviewID": "R2VCK9LKXM9YOE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As the title suggests, this camera does very well for the price I paid for it and the size of it.It's very small but packs many features. It's slightly smaller than the size of a deck of cards.The pictures are really nice, crisp and vivid. The best photos are usually achieved with tampering with the manual settings to get the right photo. Like any good \"photographer,\" you don't take just one picture of the same subject, but multiple to get that one great shot.The smart setting does an admirable job with calculating which setting is best for the current situation. This smart setting works best outside, and inside (if lighting is really good). Smart setting also works well for action shots once it recognizes your subject is moving around a lot. I found that my best shots were achieved with manual settings, but when I'm out and about outside, I stick to the auto-smart setting.The manual settings has many shooting options and they are as follows: Photo Size, Quality, EV, ISO, White Balance, Face Detection, Smart FR Edit, Focus Area, Metering, Photo Style Selector, Smart Filter, Image Adjust, ACB, Drive, DIS, and Voice.From this list, it becomes evident that a good amount of tinkering can find the best setting and that good photo.There is a button to the left of the power button that allows the user to switch between their personal manual settings and the automatic settings. Manual options also include whether to use normal AF, Macro, and Super Macro. The options to choose from multiple flash settings are in both the manual and automatic.My 1 gripe has a both a pro and a con. It is the charger that comes with the camera. It's really short. The con is obviously the length but the con that it's two parts and the one part that I like is the wall-plug itself. It has a USB port so I could probably use it to charge other USB based device via wall outlets (i.e., my iPod) the second part of the cable/charger is camera-to-PC connection (but I personally just use my SD drive in my laptop to transfer photos)Other reviews complained about the door for charger and the memory card but I have had no problems so far.This camera takes very good video as well. I don't use it too often but that's about it. Another small problem is when taking really close macro-shots, make sure you keep your hands as steady as possible or you'll get blurry photos, but do remember to take multiple photos of the same subject and delete the bad ones anyways.I got this camera along with a 4GB Transcend SDHC card for the same price of the camera itself compared at popular retail prices.The camera also arrived much sooner than expected (it actually arrived the same day my SDHC card did)tl;dr Good camera for the price, takes good photos and video, macro shots can be blurry if you're not steady and the charger is a little short.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best camera under $150!", "Author": "USF2012", "ReviewID": "R2FA2CG18YTMZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent a long time researching different cameras before I decided to by this one and it's everything I hoped it would be. I decided on the Samsung over the Sony Cyber-shot W310 and the Kodak M575, which was a tough choice because my last two cameras have been Cyber-shots. The nod went to Samsung over the Kodak because of the ISO (up to 3200 on Samsung and only 1000 on Kodak as per the two respective brand websites) and the size (less than .7\" vs .9\" thin, and weighs slightly less). The Samsung and the Sony were very close, but it came down to price and universality (as in the Samsung's compliance with more types/brands of SD cards than the Sony, and the price of said cards). All three cameras were on sale and the Samsung was also the least expensive by $10 (not a significant dollar amount, but when the cameras were this close, it matters). The 4X optical zoom is perfect for what I need to shoot and the adjustable video quality is a nice feature. The \"smart\" mode gets the shot right 9 times out of ten and the interface is rather user friendly so adjusting settings isn't too difficult. I've heard complaints about the USB door not closing and mine works fine (I opened and closed it 20+ times in the parking lot to make sure that it worked fine) and that there's no volume on video when it's zoomed in, which is a simple fix under the video and then audio menu, turn it to the middle selection which is just a microphone and it will record sound at all points. This is the best point and shoot camera I've owned and I would definitely recommend this to anyone!", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Incredible little camera", "Author": "Edgardo Pichardo \"Boomz\"", "ReviewID": "R1O5TJX6U2KBNW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best compact camera close to the $100 price tag. Includes tons of features that actually are useful and work! Camera has a very short ready time after each shot, even with flash. Great for consecutive quick shooting. Smart mode is finally really smart. Camera would automatically select the best configuration according to light and distance conditions, almost always. Face detection a lot better than Samsung SD420 (which I own too). Very light and good quality build. Metal frame feels great. Big and clear screen. 720p is good. Low light/low artificial lightning photos and videos turn out very good (or acceptable at least). That's quite a feat. Remember this is a pocket sized camera (really small) with a wide angle lens, 720p video support and 12MP resolution pictures. Bundled with handy software for photo/video editing.This camera delivers unbeatable value on it's price and size category. Highly recommended.For best results, remember to use class 6 or higher SD memory card for fast picture and video saving, as another reviewer recommended.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung Camera", "Author": "SQL4Fun \"sql4fun\"", "ReviewID": "R12T2SCK33A9T6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been looking for an inexpensive digital camera for my college-bound son.  The most important attribute was the ability to recharge the battery will it is still in the camera.  When inquiring at Best Buy last June, I was told that there are no cameras sold with that ability.  Imagine my surprise when I found this camera only one month later online.  Prior to this camera, he had a digital Cannon which required 2 AA batteries.  He told me that after about 50 pictures, it needed new batteries.  50 pictures to a college student is about 10 minutes of fun.

The size and features were great - exactly what I was looking for.  However, as I began taking pictures I could NOT get any picture to give me a crisp image like I was used to with my older Samsung camera (S860).  Even my very old 5 MP Kodak camera did a much better job at image quality.  Maybe a defective product?  I don't know.  The image looked great - nice and crisp/clear on the LCD screen until I pushed down the button to focus, then took the picture.  Every time the image would go fuzzy on the actual picture.

It is very compact and travels well; for me this also means camera shake is an issue since it is so lightweight.  The Digital Image Stabilization function can help mitigate this, but you have to enable it every time you turn the camera on.  Which is odd as the movie stabilization function stays on between power cycles.  A firmware update would be nice to fix this issue.  The USB port cover is flimsy and gets in the way when connecting the cable, which itself is too short.  White balance can be hit or miss using the auto setting.  Otherwise it's a decent camera.

It simply will not stay shut.  It was flimsy to begin with, so I was being very careful with it.  In spite of this, it will not stay closed after 4 uses.  I resist having to hold the door shut with tape for a $100 camera that I had for 3 days, so I'm returning it and am going to try a Panasolic Lumix 4x zoom digital camera instead.

The smart mode is overall pretty decent at taking pictures however to get the best results you usually have to set it to manual mode and program it to the conditions in which the picture will be taken.Pros:-The camera itself is beautifully designed.-Lightweight and small and has a good feel to it.  Very easily carried even in small pockets.-Easy to use.-Image quality is (usually) sharp and color is beautiful.-720P HD-Zooming is quick in both the camera and video mode.Cons:-There is the option of either turning off sound during zoom when recording video or leaving it on.  I hate having it mute when watching so I leave it on but it is incredibly loud.-Though image is sharp, there's a tendency for image to be slightly over exposed.  The flash can way to bright even when changing the ISO settings.-Does not use micro usb which is much easier to use.-Door to battery/memory card access is flimsy.-Must plug camera to charger to charge battery.  I prefer having separate AC Wall charger so that I may charge a backup battery.-Macro mode on this camera can leave more to be desired.Other Notes:-With the camera being so small it's easy to loose a hold of it.  The camera should be secured with wrist straps at all time.-Currently a wall AC charger can be purchased on amazon for $6-15 shipped.Despite having a longer list of cons, I can say overall this camera is nice for the price (purchased price $90).  The major drawbacks to me is the macro mode and the tendency to be over exposed.

The only other cameras on the market you'll find this thin have a static lens which is a joke.I docked a star on this camera because it uses a proprietary charging port. Just about all the electronics that have died on me over the years have died because of the charger/charging port. How hard is it for manufacturers to stick on a USB-mini which is much more robust and replacements are much more available? If nothing else give me an alternate way to charge the battery. Sorry, if you're not going to do that you lose a star.I ended up accidently putting mine through the wash, so I am buying a second one.
