The kit has everything I need for a very good price. Everything fits on Camera Case, except, of course, the Tripod, which has its own case.Both lenses are great. The external flash workes well and permits several adjusts on direction. I believe that the extra battery is essential.Very happy!", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,139.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 15 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Canon EOS Rebel T5i Digital SLR Camera & EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Lens + <2> Canon EF-S 55-250mm II IS Lens + <3> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card +\n<4> Precision Design DSLR300 Flash + <5> Spare LP-E8 Battery + <6> Vivitar 58mm UV Glass Filter + <7> Vivitar 67mm UV Glass Filter +\n<8> RC-6 Shutter Remote Control + <9> PD Digital SLR Camera Case + <10> Precision Design 58\" Tripod + <11> HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable +\n<12> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <13> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <14> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <15> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T5i Digital SLR Camera & EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Lens with EF-S 55-250mm IS Lens + 32GB Card + Battery + Case + Flash + Filters + Tripod Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516VMB2AT6L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CAXG27K"}}
