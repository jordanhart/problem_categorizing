The face recognition, stabilization and panoramic modes are awesome features for this camera. It has a very large digital display screen and a powerful optical zoom. However, the picture quality completely erases all of those positives!For an 8mp camera, this one is overwhelmingly disappointing. The camera has a very powerful optical zoom, which is completely useless. The only way to get a decent, and I mean just decent, picture... is to not use the zoom at all and take a picture outside in bright sunshine. Trying to take a picture indoors is all but a waste of SD card space. I have taken approximately 100 indoor pictures in the few months that I have had this camera. Out of those 100 pictures, only about 5 were worth printing.Last Christmas, my wife and I bought my son a 3MP camera from Wal-Mart, which cost around $45 dollars. The qualities of the pictures are about the same, which is very disappointing.I know what you're thinking; this guy just does not know how to take pictures. Well, trust your instincts if you must but trust me.... You will be wasting your money on this camera!", "Date": "December 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera with awesome features.", "Author": "David Templeton", "ReviewID": "R3E9K2YR0KBMXW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is awesome and easy to use. It takes great pictures if you learn to use the correct settings for the picture you are taking. I have been using a digital camera for years and this is by far the best one that I have found yet. It has the best features. Some people have it rated low but I would guess they didn't learn to use it and read the owners manual. The manual is included for a reason.

What's not to like about that...2)5x optical zoom, not a big difference, but a plus...3)nice big display...4)on preview, photo fills the display, whether taken vertical or horizontal(some cameras resize the vertical pics so you don't have to turn the camera to view)5)panoramic feature is a novelty, you take three pictures and line the next shots up with an overlay of a small portion of the last shot, tripod recommended6)pictures are acceptable for this format and price $[...] range(If you really want professional photos, pay the money for a professional camera)7)I don't know durability yet, but I have dropped it twice on a hardwood floor, with no ill effects8)lighter weight rechargeable li-ion battery(my personal preference over double A's)Cons:1)not as light weight or slim as my son's Canon 1100, but decent2)if you like panorama shots, it's way more professional to do them yourself in your favourite photo program3)no separate viewfinder for sunny days(never been a big issue for me for this format and price)4)real men don't use pink cameras?(It's more of a burnt rose, so don't get in a high speed wobble)Bottom line for me is...pros far out weigh the cons, and I'll probably buy another for my breast cancer survivor sister-in-law", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "GE BEST FOR ALMOST PRICE", "Author": "Anthony Cavacini", "ReviewID": "R2A43LUCKDFB1Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN BEAT THIS DEAL  SO WHAT IF IT IS PINK.PERFECT PICTURES ALL THE TIME.I BAUGHT  2 FOR THE PRICE.

The images aren't photographer quality, but they are great for everyday use and capturing the moment.  It's easy, durable, and works well.  This is not a photographers camera, it's an everyday use, easy going camera but it works well and I am happy with the product.
