{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Clear image convenient network attached camera at reasonable price", "Author": "Y. Xu", "ReviewID": "R1CCAPAA2OLMIA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought DCS910 in Nov.2008 and DCS920 one month later. I am quite satisfied with both of them and I did not meet any problem till now, or say I could solve the problems that I have found.The network attached camera supports up to 640x480 in resolution. It is higher then lots of other network attached camera which has only 320x240. So the image quality is quite good. It has good vision in dim light. you could see image or video on your web browser. It supports both MS ActiveX and Sun Java for live video monitoring but it does NOT support sound :(You may need to install ActiveX control plug-in and Sun Java plug-in for your browser to support live video.The supplied DViewCam software also supports monitoring up to 32 cameras and you could record videos into computer hard disk. I have not used video record feture till now because it requires turning on computer and consumes too much router/switch band width. I think check from web from time to time is good enough for my needs.It support user account management, NTP time sync, DDNS name service, FTP and email deliver of photos at the frequency you defined.The device does not support SSL protocol, so your password could not be encrypted for delivery. So you could not use [...] or ftps for secured communication. But this is understandable because encryption cost too much resources for the embeded system. You could not expect too much from tiny embeded device. Anyway, normal web access and FTP upload are good enough if you do not have too much security concern.It is quite simple to access the device from within the internal/home network because you PC and the camera are in the same network segment. But if you want to access the device from external/Internet, there are some other things to take care. You need to have some basic networking concept for the setup.I have seen one user complain the tech support and blame the device to be not usable. I could understand the mensioned situation. It is not the user's fault nor the product's fault. Tech support is not wrong on what they said but they should explain clearly on the technical background and guide the user for a smooth set up. User is not network expert so it will be a little difficult for them to understand and follow the network rules.Normally, ISP will only give one dynamic IP address to a user. The IP address will change when you turn on the router or after a certain period of time. So you need to keep track to your current IP address on the WAN port of your router. This is usually done by register a DDNS service(free or paid service). Most router support DDNS auto update service and this camera also supports it but you need to set it up in your device. All the devices in your home network will share this single IP address. Network applications will monitor communication port for TCP/IP communication. Different devices in your network have different unique IP address. The IP address for a specific device is unique in the network. So if you want to access your camera through the internet in a remote location, you need to have DDNS service set; set up a internal static IP address to your camera; setup your router port forward to your camera IP address. For example, use [...] to access your camera, you need to buy(or register a free child domain name from some website) your domain name 'mydomainname.com'; register your domain name to a DDNS server(paid or free service); setup your router to auto update DDNS for your current IP address; set router to forward 9011 port request to the 80 port of the static internal IP address that you have assigned to your camera(such as 192.168.0.3 depends on the settings on your router and camera). You may need an experienced friend to help you for the setting.Even if you have set everything correctly, it not necessarily means you could watch live video in your office. You should be able to access static current image from web browser in your office but live video is another story. Normally office network is protected by firewall on gateway. Most office firewall uses proxy and only open ports for web requests and some predefined application ports and bann all other communications. The ActiveX and Java live video of this device may need dedicated port connection to open communication session but this will not be allowed by default on the proxy. So unless you know your network administrator and could ask them open the port for you, you will not able to access live video in office. This is not the problem of the device, it is the rule of the network security. But anyway, you could see still image of your home which is good enough.I have used my DCS910 and DCS920 for 3 months and I am quite satisfied with the device. I would like to highly recommand this device to you for its clear image, easy setup(if you understand networking in and out), and resonable price.", "Date": "February 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Works great with Macs", "Author": "Simdude", "ReviewID": "R2MWBMYDNS7RLO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have several cameras from different vendors I use as part of a home security system. I'm using with Macs running OS X and wanted to comment on how these work with this setup.The requirements for these cameras do not list OS X as an option, but they will work once you know a few things. First, the software that comes with the cameras for setup and monitoring IS only for windows. To use to OS X I did the following:1. Connect an ethernet cable between the mac and camera and make sure your network settings are using ethernet.2. Go to your web browser and enter the address [192 dot 168 dot 0 dot 20]. This is the default address for this camera.3. Enter \"admin\" with no password and you are now in the camera setup page.4. I would then reset the admin password, enter any login accounts you want, set up the wireless login (works fine with Airport Extreme) and finally, I usually change the network setting on the camera to a default IP address. This is needed to make the camera easier to find. If you have a wireless setup with Airport Extreme, it is usually good to use something like 10.0.1.50. This will depend on your router settings though.Once everything is setup and saved, you can unplug the ethernet cable and power the camera off and back on again. If all went well, you should be able to see the camera on your wireless network at the address you entered.If you want to be able to record video, or trigger on motion, I would recommend a program like Evological's EvoCam. This is a nice program that works great with this camera.I have used other lowend cameras like some of the Trendnets and found the image quality and low light better with the D-Link DCS920. None of these low cost cameras will work great with very little light though so keep that in mind if you intend to monitor a dark room etc. For that, you will need something with infrared which will cost more.", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "A Good wifi camera solution.", "Author": "Jimh615", "ReviewID": "RIJGIHMU1IF7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Over the last 4 years, this is my fourth D-Link wireless Camera.  I started with the DCS-900W which was a 802.11b camera.I use the cameras to watch my three dogs while I'm away.The Pros: 1.  The price is right, generally less than $100. 2.  The picture quality during daylight is good (not V.Good, nor Excellent) 3.  The speed this camera transmitts to my router is far faster than my other camera, a DCS-G900.  (The DCS-920 position replaced my G900 a 802.11g) 4.  I use the D-View Cam and like it a lot.  Rather useless unless you have at least 2 cameras or you want to record.The Cons: 1.  Digital Zoom on the DCS-920 is near useless; it gets so blurry the added digital magnification is near useless. 2.  The setup with a linksys router can be trickey and requires some serious understanding.  When I got my first one, several years ago, I called D-Link Tech Support and they were fantastic!!!  They guided me through every step.  (It was an American Tech support guy in the USA)  I have used the knowledge I gained from that setup over the years as I bought new cameras.  Have never used a D-Link router. 3.  The unit is in no way moisture proof, let alone weather proof.  It is solely for indoor use.Follow up on Sep 25, 2010.  This camera is still performing flawlessly and it is still located in the same place....in my shed in the back yard as pictured.  I now, however, have switched to a D-Link router.Follow up on Dec 23, 2011.

priced wireless cameras around.On the minus side: - The picture is... bad, a little grainy, somewhat dim, and not vary sharp.  Take a look at the accompanying video for examples. - It provides very basic functionality.  Manual pan/tilt (obviously), digital zoom that only makes a bad image worse. - Once you zoom in all you see is an enlargment of the center portion of the original image.  There is no way to slide the picture to see what's outside the center area.  That means if what you want to see wasn't in the center of the original image you're not going to see it once you zoom in.  See the video for more information. - No recording. - No microphone.  That means even when you're watching the live feed you don't get any sound. - Limited picture forwarding.  You define a schedule (start and stop time, day(s) of the week) and the camera will send you images at fixed intervals.  The sending is either via email or to an ftp server. - No motion sensing.  You can't have the camera activate and transmit pictures only when there is something interesting to see. - Access to the live images from outside your home network is between you and your router.  D-Link doesn't provide any external support, such as a forwarding site, to help. - My camera arrived missing a piece for the bracket.  I'm sure that's a one-off and gives me a chance to see how well their customer service responds. - The live image is rendered either through ActiveX or Java.  Neither worked on my iPhone.  (I'm not pointing fingers at either Steve Jobs or D-Link, just saying that for whatever the reason, it doesn't work.) - The camera is pretty big.  Forget about any \"hidden\" recordings unless you plan in hiding this camera in a pile of cameras.  See the video for a more info.I gave it two stars because, like I said, if all you need is a very basic camera, can live with the poor image quality, and are aware of the other limitations then it may meet your needs.  However, if you want a whole lot more camera for a little more money then you might want to take a look at the [[ASIN:BAILSMAN Masonic BL-CA Internet Security Camera]].BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews, accompanied by detailed videos, can take the place of first-hand experiences that are often lacking in online shopping.

With replacement model already in retail stores and it is being heavily discounted with rebates, etc. I got 2 from Amazon (at slightly different prices) and one from Frys, averaging about fifty dollar each after rebates. This makes it one of the lowest price wireless internet camera one could find.This is my first IP camera so I bought one from Amazon, tested and make sure it works as advertised then bought 2 more.The good thing about being an older product is that most of the bugs and stability issues in earlier reviews are mostly gone.The camera ships with v1.04 firmware, which isn't available for download from Dlink's website. (it only has v1.03)I didn't use the setup CD at all. I did the followings:1. Plug it into my home router to get a DHCP address from it.2. Go to the router's admin web page to find out what is IP address the camera received,3. Go to the camera's admin web page with the IP address obtained from step 2 (login admin , no passowrd).Then I go through the configuration  and set up the camera to use static IP and also set up port forwarding on the router.It is up for internet viewing almost instantly. Later on I also got a free account from dyndns so there is no need to remember my routers's IP address assigned by Comcast, which may change over time. I primarily use the wired connection but also tested wireless (WPA2-PSK-AES) to make sure it works.To use motion detection and schedule video recording, it appears that you can only do so with the DView software. The included DView 2.03 is pretty raw and buggy. One trick is to go to the Dlink support site, select DCS-1130 and you can download the DView 3.0 software, which also supports DCS-920.  If you select DCS-920, only the DView 2.03 software is available for download. I had the camera for less than a week and have not had time to really use the DView 3.0, but it appears to be much better than the DView 2.03 shipped with the product.Pros:Excellent value with recent discount and rebatesGood picture qualitySetup is reasonably, not terribly easy or difficult. I didn't need any documentation for setup.Cons:Does not look attractive - The DCS-1130 looks better and seems smallerRather large - slightly bigger than a disposable film cameraCannot setup motion detection on the Camera to email/ftp - Need to use DView and keeps a computer running 24/7(scheduled ftp/email can be setup from the camera though)For a basic internet camera, the DCS-920's performance/price ratio is unbeatable.--- Update Nov. 2010 ---After having the camera for a few months, I find not being a able to set up motion detection/email alert on the camera itself is a severe limiation. Having another computer running 24/7 defeats the purpose of a self-contained internet camera with built in web server. The newer DCS-1130 has on camera motion detection and email alret, so does some low-end trendnet internet cameras that sells for less than $100. Maybe that's why DCS-920 is priced so low. It is still a cheap and decent entry level camera, but I will only give it 3 stars now.", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "I Love These Cameras....!!!", "Author": "Jorge Millan", "ReviewID": "R20V67940ITFY3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have 6 of these cameras and I'm ordering 3 more today and 3 more somewhere in the future (for a total of 12). I love them, they are easy to set up and install. I had some problem with the D-View software because I have Vista 64 bit operating system and this software does not work with 64-bit operating systems so IF YOU HAVE 64-BIT OPERATING SYSTEM THE D-VIEW SOFTWARE WILL NOT WORK... However, you can still see the cameras over the internet and you can setup an FTP server on your PC and receive up to 3 images/per second/per camera which basically functions as a recording device. I use my iPhone and the \"Live Cams\" app to see all the cameras real-time from wherever I am. You have to know how to open ports in your router and use Dynamic DNS to make the cameras available over the internet. If help is needed, contact D-LINK support and they will help you set it up (if within 30 days of purchase for free support).Little personal story before finishing my review: Someone attempted to break into my house twice within a week. By the second time, I had the cameras up and running. Because the camera is kind-of big and with a green blinking light, this deterred the burglars who ran away when they realized they were on camera. The police came, I gave them the pictures, and 20 minutes later they had captured them.So in conclusion, these are nice cameras, with an excellent price.

One spot was right above the wireless access point one floor up, less than 10 feet away. To my surprise the wireless that worked fine right next to the access point had trouble keeping a connection. The second camera was placed in the kitchen about 30 feet from the access point. It didn't have an absolutely clear line of site, but close to it.

The scheduling feature is nice, in that you can easily control how often you receive an email picture from each camera (e.g., once every hour).  If you wish to access the camera live from outside your home LAN, you need a good deal of tech savvy to set it up.  You will need to properly configure your router (assuming your router has all the necessary functionality embedded in it) and set up a dynamic DNS.  This required some background work, but once set up, it works beautifully. From any browser, I can receive live pictures and reconfigure the cameras' settings if desired.  I suspect I may have benefited from owning a D-link router -- one would think that a manufacturer would pair its products to work together nicely. If you don't mind sweat equity, this is a very inexpensive way of setting up your own home surveillance system.One feature I don't have that I might add, is a motion detector for real-time home intrusion alert.

(my company has port blocking - so I can not see the camera at work - which sucks.)3.  the ftp function works - so you can upload pictures to an ftp server (I upload to my website's server) and view the pictures that way.4. the motion detection works - and it will record, however, since the email does not work with smtp servers that require a secure connection - then it won't send you a message that the motion was activated.  In D-viewcam there is no FTP option - which would be nice - since the ftp does work.cons: 1. you can not access the camera from Safari in the iphone.  For whatever reason Steve Jobs doesn't allow java on Safari on the iphone (Safari on the mac has no problem accessing the camera's live feed) and this means that you can not access the live-view of your camera - unless you buy an app.  I'm trying to see if I can come up with a solution (w/o buying an app).

I have since had the chance to test a few other cameras and found that while the D-Link camera works ok, the small image size (320x240 at 30fps) as well as spotty wi-fi make it inferior to the Linksys WVC54GCA which retails for about 20% more.Installation:- I remember that it was a bit of a challenge to get the camera to work at first, but that was mostly because I use Macs and the install disc is Windows only. I managed to get each camera up in about 10 minutes and haven't had to touch the configuration since. I suggest you set each camera up to use a static IP address (the configuration program makes that pretty simple) so in case of a restart you don't have to try to find the device again on the network.Operation:There's really not much to it. It comes with a white wall-mount that converts to a table stand. The camera itself has an annoyingly bright green LED that blinks constantly. My other test cameras came with bright LED's as well which I can only assume relieves the manufacturer from any liabilities that may come with the territory (security cameras). The lens focus ring is unintuitive as it turns endlessly in one direction and it's tough to focus. Again a downside I found other cameras share. The case is surprisingly big and bulky doesn't really \"blend\" in anywhere. I plan on taking mine apart to see if I can save some space or mount the camera better.The biggest issue is that the cameras tend to disconnect from the network. I think the issue is related to the fact that the cameras don't renew IP addresses when the router restarts or terminates the IP lease. That's a huge problem because the particular router I am using forces IP's to expire every 24 hours. After assigning IP's the problems only appeared every 2-3 days but still annoying (my Linksys has been running steadily for 2 weeks).Pros:- Inexpensive wireles camera- Looks like a baby monitorCons:- Small image (320x240) at 30 frames per second- No microphone- Bulky- Focusing is difficult- Annoying blinking LED in front of camera- Spotty Wi-FiGo with the Linksys wireelesss camera.

To set this camera up and use it to the fullest capability, you have to know/understand networking, port forwarding, DNS, SMTP e-mail, how to setup your wireless range to get the most of it, software setup, video conversion, research the web and the list goes on.  In other words, it is not really a plug and play device.My experience with this camera, I have 6 now, is as follows:My hardware (camera, router, switches) are all the same brand, D-LINK.  In my years of experience with computers and networking, using the same brand is usually the best combination when it comes to hardware \"playing well together\".  D-LINK in my opinion makes good products, but thier support leaves a lot to be desired, to the point it's horrible.  This is where the ability to research the internet for support comes into play.Software is another animal.  Shortly after my first camera, I upgraded to Windows 7, version 2 ofD-LINK'S software (D-ViewCAM) wouldn't even load.  However, did you know you can use your browser to monitor the camera without software? You can't record, but you can keep an eye on things from anywhere in the world. I can even view all 6 of my cameras on my Droid smartphone!I found out this past summer that D-LINK had released version 3.1 of thier software that works with Windows 7 32 or 64 bit.  After some poking around, I found it, installed it and was fairly impressed.  I know there is third party software that might do a better job and I may try it someday, but D-ViewCAM does the job for now.  I did have one bad experience with the new version of software, it gave me a BSoD (Blue Screen of Death) on my main computer if I left it running in the background to record video.  This computer is Win7 Pro, 64 bit.  Whether it's the D-ViewCAM software or something else, I don't know.  But I solved the problem by testing the software with an old laptop running Win7 Home Premium 32 bit.  It's been running for 3 months now and never a BSoD or even a reboot. This allows me to record to my server. I think it's the 64 bit OS that gave me the BSoD.Although there has been complaints about the image quality of these cameras, I think it's pretty darn good.  Personally, I'm not producing a Hollywood blockbuster, I just want to see an good image.These cameras have become a pet project of mine and I could go on and on about the good, bad and what you can and can't do with these cameras, but the bottom line is, they do the job for what they were designed to do and they're fairly cheap.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "wireless camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"GCH\"", "ReviewID": "R2E4ZDFV5BMK6A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The equipment works great, the software will not allow you to reduce the screen size which stinks!", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Camera for the Money", "Author": "Frequent Amazon'er", "ReviewID": "R3MLPAFTLSPN08", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fairly good camera for the money.

You may need to disable your wireless network in order to allow you to see the camera.  If you use the software you can configure all the network settings to match that of your wireless router.  I had to power it off/on in order for the settings to seem to take hold.  I then disabled the camera network and re-enabled the wireless, connected to the Router and configured the device there with DHCP and an assigned IP address so the Router will always assign the same IP to it every time.  Then I set up the port forwarding so the router sends traffic coming in to it on to the camera at that port.  I use port 8080 since I already have other stuff running at the default http port 80.  I use DynDNS so anything coming in using the camera port, gets forwarded on to the camera.  eg. [...] brings up the camera.  That's it.  Didn't take that long to have it online.

I guess I can't fault the camera here as getting FTP going usually takes a few tries until you get the settings right, no matter what the software.So just be prepared to wrestle with the setup a bit.

D-Link states that the software is Vista compatible.  That really isn't helpful if it is only compatible with one version of Vista.

The software is very basic and worthless as far as I'm concerned.  I ended up purchasing two web cams and stand alone security software and am much happier.

Yes - it was better priced than competing products and offered free website access - both positive attributes.Second - Now  - where the camera (and Dlink Tech Support / Customer Service) failed after hour upon hour of working with Dlink Tech support:a. The camera did NOT send emails via their software - therefore NOT as advertised.b. The camera's software did NOT recognize the cameras - therefore NOT advertised.c. I was therefore unable to record key images and video - therefore NOT as advertised.d. Their tech support was grossly inadequate and ill-prepared to help.e. I wasted almost 7 hours with techs, writing emails, getting disconnected and reconnecting several times after being placed on hold for extended periods of time - and ultimately given bad advice and guidance - all of which left the problems unresolved.f. One tech finally admitted that even THEY have trouble getting the software to work properly with the cameras - and REGULARLY see these problems. While he was the most polite and responsive - he could not solve the problems either.g. They do not read the details of emails I sent requesting help - rather - they respond with canned, useless verbiage.h.
