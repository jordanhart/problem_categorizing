Wish I could see them!", "Author": "New Horizons", "ReviewID": "R1PZATLH4WC8AU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Definitely not worth $5...I agree with this previous review that it doesn't even deserve one star!  I purchased this camera for my daughter's first summer camp.  She took several pictures at camp...the counter on the camera indicates that.  Of course, when we tried to download the pictures, we couldn't get the camera to download them so lost all the pictures from her first camp.  Fortunately, we only paid $5 for the camera, but that $5 would have been better dropped on the ground.  At least then it would have put a smile on someone's face!  :)", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Clipster Digital Camera - Grn", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51U0Ey2Ay7L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004U76BD4"}}
