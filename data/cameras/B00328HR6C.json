{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very good compact point and shoot", "Author": "Busy Executive", "ReviewID": "R1UHYVL3KFCXPF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a small camera to keep with me when I didn't want to lug my big and heavy pro grade DSLR, and I'm finding the Sony generally works out for me pretty well. It's easy-to-use and relatively high performance for a compact point and shoot camera, and it's capable of producing good images under a wide range of conditions when used properly.I usually start my camera shopping by paying close attention to the lens, and the Sony comes with a Carl-Zeiss 4x zoom, biased towards the wide-angle end of the spectrum. I generally favor less zoom range if it means getting a higher quality picture, and this is exactly the approach Sony implements. Yes, you can get 5x - even 10x - zooms in camera like these, but in my experience, the sacrifice in image quality isn't worth it. Sony's 4x tends to mean I get pretty solid lens performance in a useful zoom range. To be clear, any DSLR with a good quality lens will beat the pants off the small lens on this sort of compact camera, but that's the nature of the beast...besides, if I'm doing something where absolute best performance is a requirement, I'm carrying my heavy-duty DSLR and lenses that cost ten times what this Sony does - that's not the mission I have in mind for the Sony anyway.The 14.1MP sensor seems to be high quality, so long as you're using the camera in well and evenly lit conditions. Where the camera struggles somewhat is low light (high ISO), or when there is substantial dynamic range (difference between brightest and darkest parts of an image). Under good conditions - bright and evenly lit - the sensor provides excellent detail, certainly way more than adequate for email, web sites or prints up to maybe A3 (13x19 inch) size. Still, under more challenging lighting, the Sony may be a bit disappointing...where a large DSLR can capture details in highlights and shadow, the Sony tends to blow out the highlights or will transform shadows into a sea of black. Again, this is really normal for cameras with small image sensors - the Sony's performance is very good indeed considering the small form factor and product price point.The camera's built-in software is also very good, helping to capture lots of detail even as images are compressed to manageable sized JPG files. In Photoshop, I compared a Sony-compressed image to a similar image taken by a pro grade DSLR, and there are few if any differences due to the image processing. Noise reduction and sharpening is handled well, and there are few digital artifacts visible. This is really the best performance I've seen for a camera in this price range.In terms of construction quality, the camera is solid and seems to be well built. Most of the controls are easy to use, and you don't get the sense of \"fighting\" against it. The 2.7\" LCD display is sharp and easy to use, although it can be a bit difficult in bright sunlight or for those like me with aging eyes that struggle with small text on the screen. Performance is generally quick, and you're not waiting for the camera to figure out what to do next. The camera is small, and one thing that helps me is Sony's well-designed image stabilization feature. I tend to have a hard time holding small cameras steady, and image stabilization helps me get sharp photos in most conditions.Sony adds a number of cool features, such as Sweep Panorama, that allows you to take multiple pictures of a scene, and then have them \"stitched\" together in the camera for a wide panorama view. I have similar software in Photoshop to do this, but it's cool to see it implemented right in the camera. Sony also provides a workable HDR (High Dynamic Range) capability in the camera, giving you a way to handle certain otherwise difficult scenes. Both of these features make up for camera limitations, such as low dynamic range capabilities of small sensors and the limited zoom range. Sony also makes it easy to upload photos and videos to popular sharing sites, saving you a few steps from doing this on the computer.The camera can also record HD (720p) video clips up to half an hour long. I rarely use this feature, so other than to say it works, I'll leave that one to other reviewers.I considered several other choices from Nikon, Canon, Pentax and even the new Leica X1. I like Nikon because the software and menus are the same as my DSLR (also a Nikon). Canon seemed to produce slightly better image quality. I've owned several Pentax point-and-shoot digital cameras and found them rugged and long lasting. And of course, the Leica is in a class by itself in terms of quality. Still, while all of these competitors offered unique advantages, the overall package of price and performance seemed to be best with the Sony - at least today.Overall, considering the price, I'm happy with the Sony DSC-W350 and would recommend it to anyone wanting a low-cost, easy to use digital camera that gives good quality images under a wide variety of conditions.", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly surprised", "Author": "A. A. Alasso", "ReviewID": "R2K64M973VTUST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Took a chance on this camera as it was just released by SONY and no reviews were available. But I really like this camera. The pictures are sharp. Color reproduction and exposure is accurate and all of this is done automatically. This camera has 14 mega pixels but I shoot with an aspect ratio of 16 X 9 which uses 10.5 mega pixels. The camera has  a panorama feature that with a little practice takes cool panoramas that could definitely come in handy for some landscape shots. This camera has a 26mm wide angle lens with 4X zoom. I love the wide angle which works beautifully with the 16 X 9 aspect ratio. Indoor low light performance has been very good. In bright rooms with the camera on auto flash it often chose not to flash and still the pictures were very good. My other cameras always flash indoors no matter how brightly lit the room was. Indoor shots without a flash create more natural colors. Of course this is probably only possible due to the really good anti shake technology built into the camera. The camera can also shoot hi def movies but I haven't taken any movies yet. One other thing that I like is that this camera can easily fit into any pocket. It is slim and light.", "Date": "February 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "I have larger sized cameras with very high quality but they aren't small - the Sony DSC-W350 is.", "Author": "J. A. R. Ncp", "ReviewID": "R1F5NB8A3WXG5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a camera that I could slip into my front pocket and not feel as though it was there - the Sony 350 does this. I wanted clear quality pics capturing all the quality of colors - the Sony 350 does this.I have three large Canon digital cameras which cost in the thousands dollars. They work great - but they cannot fit in my pocket - and I was seeking a small but high quality camera.  I spent a year talking with others who had large digital cameras asking them if they owned a smaller pocket one - the overall answer was a Cybershot.  Didn't really matter which model they owned, they were all very satisfied with the Cybershot. The Cybershot's lenses is made by a German engineering firm.  No other pocket size camera has such quality.So the question for me was which model, and that took four months of debate.  I am satisfied with the Sony DSC-W350; I would purchase it again.  It actually has more features (shot, video, etc) than I was seeking, and I may never use the video feature since I am primarily a still photo shooter.I will chat about the camera below, but just want to say three quick things if you decide to purchase this camera.  It initially needs 8 hours for a full charge on the battery. The internal memory is very small - spend the money for a larger size memory.  I purchased 8 GB - which I had purchased 16 GB since on a trip there isn't always the ability to download the pics to a laptop or computer.  If you are good with figuring out electronics (or owned a digital camera before - the six page book and your ability are sufficient to launch right off into a trip).  If you need more info - you will have to load the disc for the full manual.  I left on a trip two days after the camera arrived and was able to operate it fine without the full manual, but when I returned I dug into the manual for answers to all my many questions.I was going to purchase the Cybershot via Costco (yes, between Costco and Amazon it constitutes 96% of our household purchases - we have even purchased lawn mowers via Amazon).  But, with not having to pay the sales tax on Amazon I was able to take these monies and use them toward an 8 GB memory.This isn't a major negative, yet I want to mention it.  The standard digital (larger quality cameras) can take a pic directly into the sun.  There are times when you have no choice to move around - such as on a ship, or other confined areas.  The sun washes out any view you have in the viewfinder with the Sony 350.  None of the Cybershots can do this.  And, from my research I did not learn of any pocket cameras that could.  Again, one cannot have everything in a pocket size camera. It isn't a major issue, but if one is use to taking pics into the sun (if you own a larger quality camera) don't be disappointed when you cannot with the Cybershot.With my larger Canon cameras I very rarely use a flash in dim lighting and due to the camera's ability the pics are great.  The Sony 350 does not have the ability to take pictures in the no flash setting and capture quality pics with dim light. One cannot have everything though with a camera that can slip into your pocket. (The Sony 350 has an fast button for clicking flash on and off.)When I go on trip (though age 63) I still make the trip an adventure as though I was in college.  I also run full and half marathons.  I wanted a camera that I could take with me when on occasions a larger camera wouldn't work.  The Sony arrived one day before I left for the NYC Half Marathon.  I purchased the Sony 350 to carry with me on the this run.  Yes, it is that small, it can fit in your fist.  It was covered with sweat but still took great pics and had no problem later with the sweat being on the camera, and the camera working fine.  The camera was passed around to others running in my group so we all part took in enjoying pics of each other.  I couldn't have done that with one of my larger cameras.I took the Cybershot (along with a Canon) with me on a camping trip to Alaska in the early Spring - still below freezing with snow everywhere.  I gave the Sony 350 to the other person, and they had a blast taking pictures on their own. The other person has never owned a camera yet still took great pics - that's the quality of this camera.  We camped at the base camp of Mt. Mc Kinley (or Denali) and the Sony was in the snow often - never bothered the camera's ability to continue to operate.I now leave the Sony 350 in my car so it is readily accessible.  It is so small it can easily be kept in many locations not visible to a person looking in the car.  There have been many times over the many years I wish I had a camera with me to take pics when I had not planned on doing so.  Oh, I have a camera on my cell, but the quality (as we all know) is limited. The Sony 350 is small and captures the pics I want.I will always take the Sony 350 with me on trips, along with my larger Canon cameras.  I can keep the Sony 350 in my pocket at all times, and capture many candid pics that I couldn't have done with the Canon since everyone would know I was in the picture taking mood with a larger camera.  The Sony is also very easy to use, and folks will now say - let me take a pic of you.  They won't do that with my larger cameras - they were too intimidated by the larger camera (full of buttons and switches on the Canons).I would purchase the Cybershot again.  My only regret is I should have purchased it a year earlier to have part take in the fun of having a pocket size camera.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "nice point and shoot", "Author": "A. Machl \"mac user\"", "ReviewID": "R27F14G60PQ62K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had the camera now for two days. There is nothing really negative about this camera. The pictures are sharp, great colors, it's easy to use, all important features are there and work as advertized. The display is great, the build quality is solid, it is small and lightweight. The objective with a 35mm equivalent zoom from 26 to 105 is great. I often found with my old camera that I can't get all people in the picture and there is not enough room to back away to get a larger field of view. The 26mm wide angle helps a lot. In addition you can use the sweep panorama function. It works very good and is very fast. It just needs some practice to get good subjects beyond the usual panorama sceneries. Super Steady Shot is great.So to help in a purchase I write about missing features. This doesn't mean the camera is bad. For $200 it's a steal!-In camera HDR would be great-No exposure bracketing mode (but you can shoot from -2EV to +2EV manually).-Panoramas are limited to 1080pixel height x 7500 pixel wide. I had hoped to get higher resolution from a sensor that has 3000 pixel  vertical resolution.-No remote control-Unfortunately Sony offers no waterproof cameras.-Video is 720p max. 1080p would be nice but is not necessary either-more colors would be greatAs you can see it's hard to find something negative about this camera at all.The only negative I found so far is that the camera has one slot that takes either SD cards or Memory sticks. This means that inserting the memory stick is a bit tricky compared to older cameras that have only a dedicated memory stick slot. But it's not a big problem either.All in all highly recommended.", "Date": "January 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good point n shoot with a few qwerks", "Author": "Marisa Terres", "ReviewID": "R2M0MIDN01EKMD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a few weeks now and I'm still tinkering with all the settings so I know there's more this camera can do. I'm just an amateur but I love taking pictures and am trying to use this camera not only for personal use but for artistic photography as well. My main comparison though is an old 7MP Cybershot DSC P200 so it's better than that.The good:- The automatic settings work pretty well for me so far. I like the advanced scene recognition mode which will automatically take 2 pictures in lower light, one with the foreground more lit up and one with the background more lit. Produces some fun results(see customer shots).- Decent low light pictures, not too much noise.- Face recognition is great, it even picked out my dog's face a couple times hehe.- The panoramic feature is neat just practice using it a couple times to get everything in (or stop) right where you want to.- The LCD screen is big and bright enough to see if the pictures are blurry or anything like that so that helps a lot.- It starts up super fast, well I don't have much to compare it to but it's great for me. If something's going on I can get the camera out and press the power button and it's ready to go as long as I have it on the right settings before I turned it off.- Light weight and very slim. Even in a case I can fit it in my small purse and carry it wherever I go. Sometimes I have to double check that the camera is even in the case because it's really light.The not so good:- Washes out often. I took a trip to the park on a lovely sunny day and it seemed like every other picture I took was washed out. Also if I was even partially pointed towards the sun (not directly at it) I would get large lens flares. The flash really washes out the foreground as well, I'm not sure if it's just because you can get so close to your subject with the wide angle lens or if it's because the flash is overpowered.- Can't zoom in much. The 4x optical zoom is great but that's as far as you can go at the full 14 MP fine picture setting. If you want/ need to zoom in more you have to go down to 10MP and then it gets a bit blurry.- No zoom with the panoramic feature. You also have to just practice and get a feel for how long the panoramic is going to be with this feature so it may take a few trys to get the picture to start and stop right where you want it to.- The power button is tiny and flush with the body of the camera. I have small fingers so I can usually press it when I want but I've had to resort to using my finger nails sometimes to turn the camera on. Someone with large fingers might have troubles getting the button to fully depress.- Only pressing the shudder button halfway is sometimes a challenge. It's very easy to accidentally take a picture when you were still trying to just hold it halfway to focus.Overall for the price and for being a point and shoot it's a nice little camera. I'm sure once I figure out more of the settings I'll get some better results and the automatic settings have been pretty good to me so far. My complaints aren't enough to make me want to take the camera back I think I just need to get used to it a bit more.I hope this helps :)", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not bad but not the best", "Author": "Isabel M. Simonetti", "ReviewID": "RZUGXSAZ1WU97", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after reading, reading and reading some more different reviews and ratings on all the different point and shoot cameras within this price range.The first one I received was defective (it had a big purple glare or light on half of the screen so I couldn't see the image properly).  I returned it and ask for a replacement (Thank God for Amazon, they rock!!!)I got the new one today and this is what I can tell from the few pictures I've taken:1) The shutter lag or speed from one picture to the next is really fast, I love that! I have a toddler that doesn't stay in the same position or give me a big smile for the camera for more than 2 seconds.2) The performance in \"low light\" situations is perfect when you are not using the zoom. It is completely unacceptable if you use the zoom.3) The performance in bright light situations is excellent sometimes and very bad others (even if you haven't changed the settings and the light didn't change at all!).  If the sun is on the person in the photo the result is a picture where the subject looks like he/she is on fire.4) The colors are very different from the natural colors in bright situations.  I took several pictures of my friend (she is a blonde) and in all pictures her hair looks red.5) The little \"switch\" to open the battery and card compartment is very delicate and kind of \"cheap\".  I'm afraid is going to break very soon.Bottom line:Good camera when it feels like it!It definitely doesn't delivers as promised.

Even though I have brand loyalty to Sony, I seriously considered comparable Nikon and Canon cameras before deciding to purchase this one. The easy mode is great, the intelligent scene selection is especially helpful in low light settings because it automatically takes a second shot with different settings so you can choose the best one and I have already been glad for that.  Its nice to be able to turn all the auto modes off as well to shoot manually.  The menu is straight forward for the most part, although there are times when I am still looking in the wrong place for a setting.  The macro mode is also very nice for a point and shoot and I have taken gorgeous close ups of jewelry and flowers.Picture quality is wonderful and so is the HD video quality, for the value.  The panoramic feature is a bonus that similar cameras do not offer, although I haven't tried it out yet.  Small, lightweight size fits easily in a lady's jean pocket or purse which is a huge plus!!!  Yes, the exterior is plastic-y but for the price point and value, I'm very pleased.  Internal memory is low, but to me that is not a big deal at all because I'm used to relying on memory sticks and to me the only purpose of internal memory is as a back-up if your memory card is full.I have a 7 year old Sony Cybershot with 3 megapixels and it still works perfectly, but I needed a higher res model.  The Sony products I have purchased within the last 10 years still function so I am usually willing to spend a little more for Sony products because they have always lasted.

So in December of 2007 when I went to replace it I looked at many different kinds: more advanced cameras, that didn't fit the kids-concert-park-beach-camping lifestyle I live. I needed something small and fast. I tried the Coolpix and the FinePix cameras because they we in the price range and they had similar features. None of those cameras come close to the performance of a Cybershot. In the end I bought my second Cybershot. That one didn't last as long, though I have to admit it was put through A LOT. I literally tossed the little camera in my purse. It's been assaulted by pens, lipstick, spilt lotion and left in the well-over-108^ car, until finally that camera bit the big one after only being alive two years.`Kayso, on to the DSC-W350 - AWESOME! It takes pictures fast - and by that I mean the time between actually pushing the shutter and getting the picture is practically non-existent. It really bothers me when taking pictures of our kids or our ani-babies and by the time the shot it taken the shot was ruined. NOT WITH THIS CAMERA! HA! Charges last fairly a long time; I however will not be without a car charger and a spare battery, that's just me. Pictures are sharp and color is true! While it could take a picture or two to get used to the panoramic this is nothing to worry about, I found using this feature EASY!

The quality is great at 720p and you can zoom in and out although the zoom motor sound gets recorded too.  Also, zooming in and out is not smooth because the buttons are hard to press. The mono sound quality is good although it would be nice if there is a mic input.  The best thing is that now it is very easy to download the pictures and videos into my PC.Now I can readily capture precious moments while my kids are growing.", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Better than my DSC 200", "Author": "James Makasiar \"McGyver\"", "ReviewID": "R36TFT23YLE1SU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is better then the DSC W200 i currently own which I bought at about the same price.

I took my Samsung to my last trip, the camera had a lot of problems, the shutter lag, long charging cycle between shots, very short battery life, short USB charging cable (Samsung does not have a separate wall charger) , even thou the picture quality was very very good, but I missed many shots.  So, I sold it after I got back, and started to search for another camera.  I basically I was looking for a light weight compact camera with good wide angle lens, reasonable zoom, good construction, good picture quality in low light, HD video, and some good features such panorama and special filters like miniature and color accent.  On top, I didn't want to spend more than $200, preferably within $150.  Here is a list of cameras I tested and compared:Samsung PL200, Canon SD1400IS, Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH20H, Sony Cyber Shot W350, W370, H55 and HX5.- Samsung has really good picture photo, good zoom, but I am too worry about the battery life and other issues that I have experienced, so I decided to skip it.- Canon1400IS is super compact, with good amount of features, but not impressed with the LCD display, and the picture quality.  I do like the HDMI and optical zooming option in the video mode.  However, after I looked through the indoor shots which this camera supposed to be good at, I have to say this camera is over rated.- Lumix has decent picture quality but that's about it, nothing really stands out.  Initially I thought it used Leica lens because of the \"L\" logo, now I know it's just Lumix.  So I was basically looking at it because of it's price.  I left it on my short list.- W370, H55, HX5 are more bulkier than W350, because of the extra zoom.  Since I am not going out shoot birds or mountain lions, I feel 4x is enough.  W350 has the fastest shutter, almost with no lagging shot after shot in low light situations which I tested many times.  Both Canon and Samsung took forever after a few shots and charge.  The weight is almost as light as the Canon.  Sweeping Panorama is AMAZING!!!!  I tried the available feature in all the other cameras and they just frustrating.  Now, I do like to have the IS for the panorama function in H55 and HX5, then again their are bulkier and more expansive.  The EASY mode is good for quick shoots, but I like the standard IA mode and P mode.  The scene mode has the fewest scene selection than other cameras I tested, but does it matter?  No, because 90% of the time I don't use it that much.  It also catches moving people very well too.  With all the cameras I had before, I always had problems with taking photos in the direction of the light, this camera IA or EASY mode can automatically detect that and switch to the Back light mode, so the faces or objects won't turn black.  I love it!!!  So in conclusion I bought W350, and I am very happy with it so far for the price/value, size, German Carl Zeiss lens (not some OEM lenses), low light picture quality, HD video, sweep panorama, good display, minimal shutter lag, night shots, and separate wall charger.Don't believe all the bad reviews on Amazon, go try it and test it yourself, and see if this is the camera for you.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cool Camera", "Author": "C.

My past experience with cameras has been mainly cell phones and the occasional use of a middle-of-the-road Canon PowerShot.Despite my lack of extensive experience with cameras, however, I have been able to take consistently good shots with this little Sony.  Taking pictures of people is simplified by the Smile Shutter (takes a picture when your subjects are smiling) and face tracking features, which are great for taking candid shots at parties.  Smile Shutter is far from perfect, but comes in handy in a pinch. (Thankfully, the feature can be turned off if you find it more of a burden than a blessing.)  The shot-to-shot time is more than acceptable, unless you're hoping to take fast-paced motion shots (such as athletics events).  If you're hankering to take motion shots, there is a burst mode which takes a multitude of shots at approximately 1.45 frames a second.  The most useful feature, in my short time with the camera, has most definitely been the image stabilization.  With other cameras, half of my shots would be out of focus or blurry; not so with the DSC-W350.  All of you photographers with shaky hands can rejoice.If you want a convenient camera that you can slip in your pocket before you run out the door, the DSC-W350 will suit your needs perfectly.  If you're hoping to change a ton of settings and take artistic shots, this might not be the camera for you.

It has a ton of options, and several settings that simplify things (and take a more than decent picture) if you are a beginner and don't want to mess with the settings.  720p movies is a great feature as long as your expectations aren't too high.  Resolution isn't everything- you're not going to see the kind of higher bitrate clean bright picture you would with a proper digital video camera or that you see on TV or anything, but that should be obvious with a compact camera where video isn't the primary fuction.  The image/coor/motion handling are still very good though.Pictures are clear, great color, good performance in low light for a compact.  My only real gripe is the \"auto orientation\" mode.  It works in the camera's display (rotates the picture to the orientation in which you took it), but the feature is meant to save this information with the picture so that when you download to your computer the images also display in the correct rotation.  Now, I believe it IS saving the information with the picture, but it isn't displaying them correctly in windows picture viewer (i'm guessing this is the case because the manual says that some software will not use the orientation information correctly and display as it should).  I can understand that for 'some software', but... windows picture viewer?!  Come on... other than iPhoto or whatever it's called on mac, that's the only software people are going to be using to view their pictures!  I mean- I know there are others, but realistically probably 95+% of people are looking at their pictures in mac or windows native picture viewing apps...likely far more in windows just based on OS market share...so seriously that seems like a pretty big miss to me, making the function almost pointless.

I'm sorry to say although the quality is good, it's got this auto focus blur thing going on where not only when you do any movement to the camera it blurs quite a lot, but even if there's movement within a locked down shot. However, I must emphasize the still cam part is great! Just not good for video, but there again video is an aside here.I read other reviews about not-so-great battery life, but I must say those people don't know what short battery life is! My previous point and shoot (Olympus) had a horrible battery life, but this one's is excellent. I especially like the separate recharger you simply plug into the wall. As per the instructions, you should let it charge an hour after the light goes out for a full charge, which seems to make it last even longer. Charging a battery in an hour is real fast, imho.I've also taken INDOOR photos zoomed way in from far away that look pretty good. They are a little grainy, but still good for being zoomed all the way in with low light.This is an excellent still camera in this price range. If you're going to use it for photos, you can't go wrong here. For video, you're better off getting something else.

We travel, we have pets, I cook, I love food, and sometimes I just want to take a picture. I'm not into the technical jargon, the gadgetry, the glitz. I want decent pictures with a minimum of fuss. Oh, and I also want the camera to fit easily into my purse so that I can whip the camera out whenever. In the past, I've repeatedly found myself without a camera, just when, of course, I wanted it most.A friend of mine got a Sony DSC-W350 last year, and I liked what I saw. Small package, fits into a shirt pocket or small purse, controls fairly simple, takes nice point-and-shoot pictures. What more would I want than that? So I got one too.Indeed, it's a small unit (hard to see how it could be smaller and still be functional), and I was able to learn the menus easily. It's all pretty intuitive. The presets -- for pets, waterside pics, food, landscapes, portraits, etc. -- all work really well, and even I, the non-photographer, can produce really decent pictures. I especially like whatever it does to food pictures: the camera makes food of all kinds look really appetizing. The exposure adjustments, for brighter and dimmer light, work exactly as they should. And although I didn't think I'd have any use for it, I love the panorama feature. My husband says that if I ever decide to make a large print of the panorama pictures, though, I might be disappointed in the resolution. Haven't wanted to do that yet, so what do I know?There is one feature of the camera that has been a problem for me, and that is the lithium battery. It works well, and it holds plenty of charge for a day of average picture taking (for me, anyway). I don't mind having to charge after a day of picture taking. But when on holiday recently, I left the small charger unit in the socket at our hotel. Bad news. By the time I discovered the oversight, we had moved on. \"No problem,\"I thought, assuming I could pop into an electronics store to pick another up. Wrong! The little socket charger was no-where to be found. We ended up buying a universal charger, which will accommodate different types of batteries. A useful item, but it was expensive. So the lesson is: if you buy a DSC-W350, guard that little charger gizmo!My little Sony lives in my purse, and periodically I take it out and charge the battery overnight.

The specs on this model really impressed me, so I was pretty excited when I started opening the box. My initial impression was favorable, because this camera is extremely small and the button layout seemed to be designed in a logical fashion. The battery is a rechargeable lithium-ion model (non-memory type), which took around two hours to charge on the included external battery charger. Additionally, this camera uses Memory Stick Pro Duo or SD/SDHC memory cards for storage. I had a SanDisk 2GB card left over from a Sony PSP memory upgrade and it worked without a hitch. The battery and memory card are stored in the bottom of the camera and the protective door is pretty flimsy. I'm usually pretty careful with electronic devices, but I could see the battery/memory door breaking after repeated use. As far as pictures and video are concerned, I feel the camera fell short on performance. I used the default settings to take some pictures indoors and they were either blurry or washed out from the powerful flash on this unit. Also, I don't think this unit has a red-eye reduction feature, because all my shots with people had red dots. My other cameras have the red-eye reduction feature, so it was definitely missed on this camera. As far as video is concerned, some of my footage was out of focus in some places. I know this is primarily a still camera, but I really wanted the video capability to shine. So, here is a rundown of the pros and cons of this camera:PRO:1) Compact Size (fits easily in shirt pocket)2) Wide-angle lens3) Panoramic mode (still photo only)4) 720p HD Video5) 14.1MP Photos6) Non-Memory Rechargeable BatteryCONS:1) Auto-focus is hit and miss. Hard to tell on 2.7\" LCD screen if picture is actually focused properly2) No optical viewfinder3) Focus during video mode is poor4) Flimsy battery/memory door5) Included wriststrap needs a slide to secure properly (i.e. Wii Remote wriststrap). Camera almost flew out of my hand a few timesIn conclusion, I'm not happy with this camera and I am returning it tomorrow. I am not an expert photographer by any means, but I have two other digital cameras and five camcorders which perform better than this unit. I want a true point-and-shoot camera, not something that requires me to fool with a ton of settings to get good pictures.***UPDATE (6/6/10)***To replace this camera, I purchased the Nikon Coolpix S4000. It worked better \"out of the box\" with its red-eye reduction... no \"glowing pupils\" on people or pets! Pictures look great and it has a slightly bigger LCD viewfinder than the Sony (3\" vs 2.7\"). Also, the video looks good with the Nikon. I'm a little bummed though, because I saw the Nikon S6000 today at my local military exchange for the same price as the S4000! It even came in special \"promotial packaging\" with a genuine Nikon carrying case and a 2GB memory card. Too bad, the big-blue electronics store charges a 15% restocking fee on their digital camera returns! Doh!***UPDATE (9/21/11)***I updated the review to clarify the compatibility with memory cards. Previously, I mentioned that the camera only uses Memory Stick Pro Duo cards only. This is not correct. The camera uses Memory Stick Pro Duo or SD/SDHC memory cards. Sorry for any problems this may have caused with some folks. My original opinion, however, is still the same about this camera... I was disappointed.

I have considered Sony many times in the past but was always turned off by that stupid proprietary memory stick. Now that they have finally adapted to the SD card, I could seriously consider buying one.I bought this camera about a year ago to replace my malfunctioning Canon Elph. This Sony camera is simple to operate, and the images come out great. The optical zoom, quality lens, and the stabilization help with this effort. The big crystal clear screen is great and permits viewing even in high ambient light levels. As an architect, I am pretty hard on my digital cameras - they get shoved in my pocket, dropped on the ground, and left in my 150degree car on hot summer days. This camera has taken this abuse like a champ, never let me down. The only negative I can possibly come up with is that the mode selector (for regular photos, panoramic, and video) is right along the edge of the camera - I sometimes inadvertently hit this and find myself shooting a video when I mean to simply take a photo. This is not a significant problem and hopefully Sony will consider this on their upcoming designs.I have now taken about 6,000 photos with the camera, and would definitely recommend it.

I bought it to take on trips abroad, and I was particularly looking for a camera that was portable, would take good pictures without a tripod, and worked well in low-light conditions with no flash.  I've had issues on past trips where lots of my pictures came out blurry because I couldn't use flash in a church or around art, so that was a top priority for me.  This camera got good reviews at CNET, so I took a chance.First of all, the size is perfect.  It fits in my pocket with no problems, and I am not someone who wears baggy pants.  The only issue I had was that there is a sliding selector for shooting mode (camera, panorama, or video) that I kept hitting when I pulled it out of my pocket.  Not a huge deal, but occasionally annoying.  Second, the pictures really did come out great.  I had a few that were blurry, but only about 1-2% of the total.  Some of it was me, some of it was the camera.  I was impressed with the picture quality.  I was also impressed by how quickly I could snap a shot and turn away.  The camera took a few seconds to process, but there was very little shutter lag, so I could take the picture and move on (a big plus in crowded, touristy areas).  Third, the camera worked AWESOME in low light with no flash.  I took pictures in rooms that were almost dark and they looked fabulous--not blurry or dark at all.  I held the camera as still as I could, but the image stabilization really did it's job.Finally, I liked how easy it was to take a panorama.  You just slide a selector on the back of the camera down one click and hold the shutter down while you sweep the camera in the direction of the arrow on the screen.  It couldn't be easier.  Zoom is not available in panorama mode though, and it is very picky about making sure you move in the right direction.  If you try to move the camera off of the line it wants you to follow, it will give you an error message (straight lines only, no veering off).  The video worked well enough, but you need to move slowly at first to make sure the camera knows what to focus on (or you'll get a blurry video) and it's a little awkward to stop the video, so you should plan on a little editing later.Additionally, I would recommend getting some large SD cards (I went with 8GB, which will give you about 1,500 pictures) and setting the camera down to 10MB for most photos.  I got a second battery (a cheap one from an Amazon merchant), which was very necessary.  I was averaging 200+ pictures a day on my most recent trip, and I just about ran down 2 batteries each day.  I never use flash, but I used lots of zoom, took panoramas, and spent plenty of time moving in and out of various lighting conditions.  This is the first camera I've had that's been able to keep up with me.  I felt like the pictures I got at the end of the trip matched the memories I had, which more than I can say for many of the other cameras I've tried.", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelente!!!!", "Author": "R.

Not to mention that I photograph semi-professionally with my trusted Sony a700 and Zeiss lens (jcasasphotography.com - shameless plug =) Anyways, this camera is definitely a gem to use. It's the perfect weight and size that can stay in my pocket everyday. I even chose this over the Sony hx5 even though that camera surely had better specs. My main purpose though is to have a good camera on me all the time. Even with the Sony w290, the large bulge in my pocket made it uncomfortable to carry the entire day. With the w350, it simply can be forgotten in my pocket as it's that small.Use is straight forward: I personally keep mine in Program mode and try to never zoom to retain the 2.7 aperture. [Zooming jumps the aperture beyond 2.7--this is why zoom lenses with a constant aperture of 2.8 are really expensive] That is to be noted as well for any photographers out there knowing their apertures and shutters: this is one of the few cams that has an aperture of 2.7 for this price! Many other Sony Cybershots start at 3.5. With an aperture of 2.7, it definitely allows you to gather plenty of light for low-light photography.I also chose this camera over the PowerShot series because of the Sweep Panorama mode. While I don't expect to print a panorama anytime soon, it's a great option to really capture some great scenery if you don't have your DSLR + ultra wide angle lens on you. I know that you can stitch together individual photos but this mode makes it extra easy to do so with some pretty good results.HD video is good enough in my opinion. For me, it definitely beats carrying multiple devices [I'd rather get a pocket camera that can shoot HD video than a Flip or comparable video camcorder that can shoot stills]Battery life is something I'd like more of. I was able to achieve more from the w290 in my opinion but with the low price of this camera, it's definitely affordable to get a spare battery.All in all, I couldn't be anymore happier with this camera.

The major problem with it, which was a deal-breaker for me, is that there is noticeable distortion near the left and right edges at wide angle. It's pretty bad and it extends far enough into the frame to turn some shots into a fun-house mirror. Well, it's not quite that bad but when you look at some pictures you're probably going to notice it. You sort of get the feeling that they were trying to go too wide with the technology used. I would rather they had gone with a 28mm equivalent lens if it would have meant that not nearly as much distortion would be present. Secondly, pictures tend to be overexposed, especially when using the flash. Manually reducing the exposure after noticing the picture exhibits those symptoms and shooting again would probably help, but then it's not going to be as easy to use that way. But this brings about another point worth mentioning: the LCD screen is horrible. Everything looks bright and overexposed on it, and it's hard to analyze your pictures using it. Oddly enough, it helped to not look at it from a 90 degree angle but instead around 45 degrees. There's also not much clarity in the pictures themselves. People come out soft quite often. Finally, auto-focus has some problems during video that can be pretty annoying. You might change to a subject that's closer or farther and it could be a while before the auto-focus adjusts.That's not to say it doesn't have a number of pretty good features though. It's relatively cheap now, very small, and the battery life is decent (though not great). Somehow, it performs better than many other point and shoots in low light and the HD video with optical zoom is pretty good even if the zoom is noisy (can be heard in video) and jerky. The Sweep Panorama feature makes it easy to take panorama pictures, though they can't be considered high quality. Many reviews say that the higher end Sony cameras do a much better job. As long as your subjects aren't too close to the edges at wide angle, the pictures will come out nice if they don't come out overexposed.I really wanted to like this camera but the distortion and overall picture quality made me look elsewhere.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera for a great price!", "Author": "C.

The Intelligent Auto is pretty neat and the other features are also. I like how you can show a slideshow and play it with music (either your own, or the music already on there). The panoramic feature seems awesome! I would love to use this in cities, beaches, parks, etc. I am a photographer, so all these things are really helpful for me to learn. I do agree with the customer who said that you can't really hold the shutter button down halfway to focus as easily as some other cameras, but thats not a huge problem. The smile feature is neat also. You just press the smile icon on the pad thing and you shoot the camera at someone's face and it automatically takes a picture. That is really neat.

But usually it misses the shot, taking too long to decide what mode to use and often seems like it can't focus even on well lit slow moving objects. The battery will not last for even an event of a couple of hours and replacements are pretty pricey. I am thinking about contacting customer service at Sony to complain about this camera. Also the veiw screen scratches way too easy. The upside is when it decides to actually take a picture they look amazing, the panorama mode is a nice feature, and with a little practice produces good results, The HD video looks incredible, the sound quality is good, but the only way I can play it is using the built-in software on the camera, or upload it to a website.

Terrible build quality", "Author": "Dizturbed One", "ReviewID": "R2AFZX760MYSQ5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First of all, if you are looking at this camera today, it is of no use. There are better camera's for less money because of the huge advancement in tech over the past few years. I had this camera for well over 2 years, and it recently died completely after a year of hassle with the buttons. When I bought it, it was comparable to other compact camera's in the 300 dollar range. It has the shortest life of any point and shoot I have ever owned. Partly because of image quality I couldn't get comfortable with, and mostly because of terrible hardware.Photo's from this camera are decent in decent lighting, although a bit soft. In well lit situations that do not require flash at all, the pictures are quite excellent, although color is slightly dull. The aperture is decent, but it still seems to suffer in low light terribly. My main gripe with this camera is the slow operating time and bad image quality in low light, worsened by a terrible auto shutter and iso adjustment. A complete lack of manual controls over these things only frustrates things further.After about a year, it would get lens errors on occasion and force me to restart, missing the moment most of the time or resulting in an awkward \"JUST WAIT A SECOND, I ALMOST GOT IT!\" type of moment. Then the circular button pad started rotating in the bezel, rendering it inoperable unless you lightly rotated it back into correct position. Any usage of it however, would rotate it out again. These two problems happened SHORTLY after the 1 year warranty expired. After a year or so of this frustrating circumstance, the mode switch started changing back and forth... By itself. This basically rendered the camera useless, as it would switch to panorama or video mode while taking a picture, and vice versa, with even the slightest jostle of the camera.Decent performing point and shoot in a good size, bad low light performance but that is common in this size of camera (best I've seen is a Canon S100 for low light in a compact). The hardware quality is what ultimately turns me off. I have a 9 year old 2MP Kodak Easyshare that takes better low light pictures and still works fine (my grandma uses it still) and a Samsung Digimax that is 5 or 6 years old, and still works great (again, better low light performance and less noise all around)... Yet this Sony has had 3 major hardware failures within 24 months of owning it, the first rearing it's head after barely a year. Pretty bad considering Sony has complete control over almost all of the hardware they put out, unlike many other companies.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Small Camera with Panoramic Shots", "Author": "Alexander Flynn \"Thorflyn\"", "ReviewID": "R1EJB3G2JWQ203", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera largely for the ability to take panoramic shots.  It takes decent regular shots and video as well.  At first I was very enthusiastic about the camera and took it on business trip to Las Vegas.  I took many shots with the camera and many on Panoramic mode in parks like the Sahara National Preserve, Red Rock Canyon (just outside of Las Vegas) and Joshua Tree National Park.Panoramas are easy to take and produce good quality images.The downside is that the panoramic images are not as high a resolution that you would think - especially in regard to the height.  It also tries to make you take a panorama that is a very large angle.  I suspect the longer it is - the less likely you are able to hold the camera steady (without a tripod) and the up/down movements reduce the height of your image.There are some neat features of the panoramic mode that allow you to take panoramas going in any direction.Would love to take two panoramas from the same position at slightly different angles and have the camera put it together.  Then I could address the height issue.  I really want to print my images in large format and this is difficult to do.  Microsoft has a product that can help with this as well.  Using a GoPro camera and the Mircosoft software you can produce really good panoramas as well, but there is a slight distortion due to the wide angle of the lens in the GoPro.Between the two cameras - I had a lot of great pictures that I really want to print and cover my office with at work.

AND SHOOT. I took some amazing pictures of the Mayans while down in Mexico on vacation.***Like most point and shoot Cameras it takes slighty grainy pictures in low light.***IT takes great panaramic photos. You basically sweep the camera from left to right in a smooth motion and the camera takes three photos which are stitched together by the camera in less than a millisecond without you even knowing it,so in other words, as soon as you take the photo your done. Where as most other cameras you have to stitch together yourself after you upload it onto your computer.*** As far as the HD video that the Camera has? Well its been hit and miss.I mean around 50% of the videos that I try and filmare alway out of focus or it doesnt come into focus until a few seconds later after you start filming, as I am showing youin this video. Thats annoying and cost me a great clip I tried to take in mexico.***Bottom line= is that it takes better quality photos than my other point and shoot \"Canon powershot A1000IS\" it also has HD  video and takes Panaramic pics Which my Canon doesnt but IF I had been using my Canon while down in Mexico instead, I wouldnt have lost that great video that I took of the \"IK KIL Cenote swimming hole\" but the Sony made up for it whith the award winning photos of the Mayans that I took with it :)", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's ok", "Author": "R.

I've been happy with the color and sharpness of these shots. Cons - video quality is quite grainy.

I haven't been able to figure out how to keep the focus on infinity in video mode. Cons - indoor red eye setting plus flash takes forever (about two to three seconds) to get the shot - by then people are so flash blinded, or have moved (especially children) so that you can't really get the shot you wanted.

The first time I used it was on a 9-day trip to the Carolina Coast.  I am not an expert photographer.  This purchase was to satisfy your average camera needs (girls night out, family get togethers, vacation, my cats).  The reviews I read warned me of the lag when turning the camera on and when you can snap a photo.  There is also a lag between photo snapping (which directly relates to the time it takes between when you take a photo and it comes up on the review screen).  It seems like an eternity.I have tried the panorama setting a few times and I guess I just don't know how to do it right.  My photos ended up looking like I was peeking through a peep hole... REALLY big on the left and right and normal sized in the middle.  I did not try to video setting.My biggest pet peeve was the review button.  On my last Sony camera, I just had to press the \"left\" button to view the last photo I took.  There is no option on this camera to just view your last photo.  You have to review all of them and then select the photo you want to review.The menu is pretty easily navigated once you play around and get used to it.  I think it helped having used a Sony camera before.  I did not like not being able to control the flash if the camera was set to automatically choose the photo setting (Nighttime, Portrait, Landscape, etc).  Then if you chose your own setting and changed the flash to anything but Automatic, it would stay at that setting if you switched the photo setting back to Automatic.  Very annoying.Zooming left much to be desired.  It would zoom too much and I would try to zoom in or out just a little and it would just jump to extremes.  It seems like it was programmed to jump like that upon first zoom and then when you hit it a couple times, I think it realizes you just want to zoom in or out a little.  So after I have waited for the shutter lag from my last picture and then fiddled with the zoom for the next shot... there's a good chance I've lost my photo op.But I'm not made of money, so I will just live with it and adjust for it.  Because what makes the camera worth it is the photo quality.  I developed my vacation photos using Snapfish (and the developer always plays a small role in photo quality), but I don't know if they could be too much worse if I got a bad development job.  The colors were crystal clear and the images were sharp.  Details could be easily seen in the close-ups and I just have no complaints on photo quality.  They were bright and vibrant and helped all my family and friends see how beautiful the Carolinas actually are.I can't say I would recommend the camera because of its shortcomings, but the photo quality is excellent and if you don't care about the rest, it is definitely a nice little camera.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "works as described", "Author": "lloyd", "ReviewID": "R13UMQVVT74O6M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "picture taking is of very good quality.shutter speed and automatic focus is pretty darn fast...everything works and does as it say's in the description.The only thing that's not so good is the quality in the panorama..the quality is not as clear as the regular pictures..but over all..I am satisfied with the camera.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "zaz", "ReviewID": "R32N35KN41Z1JU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing camera, love the image stabilization which sets sony apart from other cameras, burst mode can take fast pics the picture quality is amazing and the picture quality does not decrease with zoom like some other cameras, Loving every minute of using it!!!! only wish it had a further zoom, otehrwise a 5 star product", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "NikkiUs1346", "ReviewID": "R3MQ34CVKJIKQX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a high end quality digital camera for my  84 year Dad and after quite a bit of research found Sony to be the right fit for him.

While some of these take OK pictures, they're still not usually of really GOOD quality.  This camera is a great addition to your device arsenal.  It is very small and lightweight (can fit in a shirt pocket), shoots in great quality of stills and video, and you can get a lot on the memory stick.  I have an 8GB stick, and used it as our main camera on a recent vacation taking a combination of VGA video and stills.  It took almost 8 days to fill it up, and that was at the highest still picture quality and VGA video.Unlike some digital cameras, this one is FAST.  Others take several seconds to focus.  While this one will, with more time, fine tune settings if you let it, you can also literally point and shoot and get really good quality. By taking a few additional seconds of partially pushing the shutter button, the camera will fine tune the focus, flash, and exposure--but if something happens quickly, you won't miss the shot while the camera decides how it WOULD have taken the picture, if it had been ready!All in all, I found it to be an excellent value for a very compact camera.", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony camera review", "Author": "tennis mom", "ReviewID": "R1TNSR75QJ8I6U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera!

I also went to the local Best Buy, and handled as many cameras as possible.  I was looking for the smallest possible camera in the under $150 range.  I previously owned a Nikon Coolpix S1 that I really loved, but one too many days in a hot car in the sun in Palm Springs and the viewing screen fried.  Also have a Canon PowerShot A610--with 4 AA rechargeable batteries and a reversible viewing screen, this puppy lasts forever.  However, it's BIG.  I was looking for a camera I could always carry in my pocket to record video testimonials.  The ultra-tiny and light Sony would, I thought, fill the bill.When I opened it and started playing with the controls and settings, it seemed to me to be designed for teen aged girls.  Nothing wrong with that, just not for me.  The principal settings on the still shots register big smiles, small smiles, and medium smiles for automatic shots.  And smiles by 1 person and 2.  I guess after all of the far more relevant (to me) settings on the Nikon, this was a disappointment, and set the tone for the rest of the issues I had with it. This camera is probably better for my daughter at Palm Springs High School, who loves to hold the camera in her hand and get shots of her and her girl friends together.  Definitely not the type for my web page!I am very disappointed by the quality of the still photos.  I have set most of the settings to automatic to (ideally) reduce user errors in picking the wrong settings.  But my indoor shots are coming out ... yucky.  The color balance is way off, the steadyshot or whatever on this camera doesn't seem to work that well, and the pictures of people are just not very clear.  I also miss the on-board processing that my Nikon S1 had--it would correct everything and give me a choice of keeping it, erasing the original, or keeping both.  AND I could see if the picture was salvageable.  AND it had about 26 alternative scenes from which I could select.All an all, I'm just plain disappointed with the camera.

None of these obviously improve the results, but they are entertaining to watch (as faces are identified and scenes guessed at).The smaller size make the camera even more portable, you can put it in the front pocket of your jeans or in a suit pocket and pull it out for a quick shot whenever the scene demands a photo or two.The camera takes very reliable shots indoors at somewhat lower light than the w300, and with the somewhat wider view, it can fit more of what's interesting into the frame. There is little camera lag and the results are normally very good except that the flash will--as most small cameras do--burn out the details of people and objects that are a bit too close.The main problem with the camera is that outdoors the lack of a view finder means that you shoot blind a good deal of the time. That is, often, you literally point and shoot because you can't see anything in the LCD screen. Other times, you have some rough idea about what is in the scene, but can't really see how its processing the colors etc, because everything looks so washed out when shooting in bright sunlight. In most cases, the camera calculates correctly and the shot is what you had in mind. However, in some cases, objects literally disappear from the photo that were clear as a bell with your eyes. For example, I took a \"fine\" shot of the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial yesterday in bright sunlight, and when I reviewed the photos they were not there at all--evidently the digital equivalent of UV (excessive contrast?) burned them right out of the picture. (I cannot remember that happening with the w300.)Nonetheless, most times the results are very good and together with the size--big enough that it does not get lost in your hand or pocket, but small enough to ignore while walking around--makes it a good compromise.  If it had an \"old fashioned\" view or bright lcd, I would give it a 5.", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Doesn't last and Sony doesn't stand by it", "Author": "Benjamin T Caldwell", "ReviewID": "R13I203SYSFKRJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We were initially very satisfied with the camera. It's a point-and-shoot, so there are typical compromises in terms of customization and image distortion. It was sleek and took good snapshots though.That was for three months of normal use - no exposure to rain, no water spills on it, nothing. After three months, we noticed that the autofocus light was stuck on so we sent it in for repair. A week later, they call back to let us know that the unit had corrosion on the inside and so the warranty was voided. This is after three months of gentle use, with the camera traveling in a case and again, with no exposure to water.

I ended up returning both.  A trend in small cameras nowadays is to rely on image stabilization to lower the \"normal\" shutter speed to 1/30.  That way the ISO can be set back another stop without using a flash.  This actually seems to work fine, but my small daughters don't sit still long enough for 1/30, so I returned the cameras.This camera performed well otherwise.  I really liked the panaroma and the settings options.  The pictures were great.  The WX5 did just as well but didn't \"feel\" as good.  The WX5 has higher resolution video and some 3-D function.  If you don't care about that, buy the W350 and save $100.In the end, I bought a canon SD4000.  With the right program settings I was able to get it to use 1/60 most of the time at ISO 125 with flash indoors.  I really drives me crazy that it took me four cameras to find one that would take a sharp picture of a moving object without ISO 600-800 distortions.  My Sony Cybershot P200 from five years ago still takes sharper pictures than any compact I have touched since 2007.  Sorry for the rant.

Whereas the older model had the presettings readily available on a handy dial, this one requires browsing through the internal software, two and three clicks away.  Unlike previous models, the picture settings can only be accessed by fully turning on the camera and drawing out the lens, doing away with power-off pre-setting.  What this means is that you'll need 5-7 seconds more to take a shot.The picture quality is ok. If there is motion stabilization, it's negligible. Anything but a steady hand will make pictures come out out of focus. In the non-automatic settings, the pictures take three-to-four second to capture. The panorama setting turns out very low-quality photos, and won't produce anything more than a gimmicky shot.Most annoyingly, it eschews standard connectors to the computer, requiring its very own cable cord.

I wasn't.  The camera is just that bad.  (And I've had other people use it with the same results.)Here are the specifics:1. The flash is so bright that if it flashes you lose almost all contrast.2. The camera cannot take photos indoors or in medium or lower light without the flash.  They turn out blurry or grainy or both.  (And when I say grainy, I mean that in a 2x3 inch version you can still tell it's grainy.  Not just in some super-blown-up version.)3. The colors end up all wrong with either the flash, or without the flash indoors.4. There is an entire light range where the auto-flash does not go off, but without the flash the pictures are so blurry that I just want to force the flash, even though I know it will bleach the picture.  Well, there's no force-flash option.  So in that entire light range I just have to give up and accept that I will never get pictures.The pros: It is small and cute and the pictures are good in bright mid-day Southern CA sunshine.Bottom line:  If you only plan to take photos outside during the day in relatively bright sunlight, this is a great camera for you.
