I took pictures at a classic car show last week (bright sun) and cut off some of the cars by about 1/10th of the car.  Very disappointing product.  Also the price of the shade was five dollars and some cents and the shipping was five dollars and some cents.  Bad news!

It seems strange that the camera manufacturers didn't think of this for their products as an accessory or installed from the box. Allows the screen to be clearly seen in every light situationshe has run across so far, and the price was great. The fitment is perfect. The camera still fits it's case and it blends in with the camera so well it looks like it is OEM.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "What do you expect for $10?", "Author": "Brian Weeden", "ReviewID": "R2OJFM3A70C0NN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does what it's supposed to.
