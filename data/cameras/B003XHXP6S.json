{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony fell VERY flat with this one...", "Author": "Jason Frost \"RubiconReader\"", "ReviewID": "RYVVF6S1FFDZ3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My first Sony camera was a Mavica (loved it and still have it).  My second camera was a 8.1 MP DSC-N1 (BEST camera I have EVER owned and have had it for five years).  This one is my third.  I wish I could say that I was excited and pleased about this one as I've been about the other two, but I'm not.  Not even close.  Since I was so pleased with the first two cameras I had NO problem being brand-loyal and staying with Sony.  I did look at other digital cameras to see what they had and basically no one had everything I was looking for in one camera like Sony.  14.1 MP, HD video recording, different shooting modes, and a compact size.  I'm no pro but I know about my digital cameras.  Since my DSC-N1 broke (sniff) I immediately compared this camera to that one.  It had to be better right?Wrong.  Glaringly wrong!  For starters the touch screen isn't as nearly clear as the DSC and the picture quality is FAR from what I expected.  Going from an 8.1 MP to a 14.1 MP, I should have seen a dramatic change in picture quality.  Actually... I did.  But in the opposite direction.  How can an 8.1 produce clearer shots than a 14.1?  And they both have the Carl Zeiss lens!  When I download the pictures to my computer and blow them up there is a definite and quite obvious difference in the picture quality.  Not cool.  The other thing that is very frustrating is the \"fishbowl\" effect on the edge of the pictures.  The middle of the picture is OK but the outer edges look like I gave this camera to Aqua-Man and told him to go for it.  Having my pictures look like that is unforgivable.  I have tried different settings, mixing and matching but nothing seems to get rid of that \"fishbowl\" effect.I was trying to be \"smart\" and not get the camera I wanted because of the money.  Next time I'll know better.  This was an expensive lesson to learn but I've learned it.  I'm so frustrated with this camera I threw it up on Craigslist barely two weeks after I got it to try and get rid of it.  Unfortunately the only takers I've had have been the \"I'll send you a money order\" scammers.  This camera comes with all the bells and whistles but unfortunately the important ones, pictures and picture quality, fall way way short.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic tiny Sony", "Author": "Nirmala Dindial \"Amazon shopper maniac\"", "ReviewID": "R3SP33YXU5CRT3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Camera! Does all that the advertisement says it can do. Very slim. Neat looking. Excellent pictures and an EASY setting option. I owned a Sony T-100 and the Samsung pocket dual screen and I love this more. Dual screen not really helpful because when you take a picture of yourself you can really only get background as far as your arms can stretch. The panorama feature in this camera is waaaay worth it. Most importantly, buy it from AMAZON, it is cheaper than the Sony website and arrives quickly and in excellent condition.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "terrible zoom", "Author": "cp \"cp\"", "ReviewID": "R20O0P1MUTM98L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Even so if all the rest is great, you will be very disapointed and frustrated at many times because of the poor zoom.DOn't sacrifice this caracteristique, it is too important!", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "User Friendly", "Author": "DancingNancy", "ReviewID": "R2SHLSUW0Q0B8M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was intimidated by a touch screen camera with all these different options, including the Panoramic Sweep feature. I'm in no way a professional at all, just a Mom with a really cute kid and a love for taking pictures. This camera is so easy to use. I love the interior zoom, the size is perfect, the touch screen is not overly sensitive, but sensitive enough. It has fun little features, too...Such as cute frames or \"stamps\" to put on your pictures. You can also edit and re-touch photos right on tthe camera. Very VERY happy with it so far!!!", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "AWESOME CAMERA!!", "Author": "MUSSERWIFE", "ReviewID": "R30PCWWV57P25U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "super awesome camera! has so many cool and useful features. got for my husband for his work and he really loves it!", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly good for such a small camera", "Author": "Renee D. Turner \"renee the produca\"", "ReviewID": "R2WBZTYOUFP64K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera to replace an HP camera, which surprisingly did a wonderful job of taking photos under some very difficult situations but eventually broke. I also own a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H5, which also is a great camera that takes wonderful shots, and a Nikon SLR. But, I was looking for an replacement camera I could put in a pocket or purse that also was versatile and took great pictures. This camera fits the bill.The T99 is my first foray into the touch-screen camera world and it has been a good experience so far. The touch screen is responsive and easy to navigate. I like having my controls just a touch away. The T99 also provides the standard variety of point-and-shoot scene selections as well as a number of helpful auto focus modes which can be switch quickly as needed. The only thing that was hard to get used to was not having a viewfinder. Even so, the 3-inch wide, crisp display made the adjustment a bit easier even in sunny and low-light conditions.With no viewfinder, though, the question is whether what you see in the display is what you'll really get when you download or print your pictures. With the T99, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.The picture quality was outstanding, much better than that of the flashier and similarly sized Nikon S80. I took a series of shots near D.C.'s monuments earlier this week and put them through the paces of Photoshop Elements, blowing them up, looking at the edges for any distortion or picture degradation. Remarkably, I didn't find any and had to make very few corrections. The pictures were sharp, crisp, vibrant and quite detailed.My only complaint is that a 4x optical zoom can only take you so far. Otherwise, the T99 is a great little camera that will come in handy when you need to tick off a few shots on the fly.", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony T99", "Author": "JaniceWoods", "ReviewID": "R2ACSG0198Q7C3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera so much I purchased three of them and gave them as Christmas gifts.
