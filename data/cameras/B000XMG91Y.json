I am mounting bullet type cameras and box type from them with no real issues at all.  Very sold basic mount, and I have zero major complaints with the product.Minor complaints and or enhancements I'd like to see are:More adjustment detents on the adjustment bracket, all too often my perfect shot is in-between two of the adjustment points.  This holds true for up and down and left to right.I have gotten two different colors, and two different types of packaging when ordering these.  I'd prefer a standard so I know what to expect.  Even better to just offer these in a few colors to best suit the camera or location it is getting used in.I'd also like to see a shorter version of this mount, maybe 6\" long.  Most of the new IP cameras are very small and do not need this long or big of a mount.Even with those wanted enhancements and minor quibbles, I will still buy many more of this mount as it works just fine and for the price I'm perfectly happy!", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well Made", "Author": "Matthew B.
