So after a week of intensive use and testing (we are both professionnal wedding photographers) here are the pros and cons, some of them compared to the rebel:PROS:- 8 MP- L \"pro\" lens, really delivers crisper and sharper images than the bundled EF-S of my rebel, but I still prefer my EF 50mm f/1.4 USM- 28-200mm equivalent is everything we could ask for weddings, we usually stay in the 28-80 range anyway because of flash range limitations- the built-in flash is reliable, fast and strong- lots of functions and modes, + 2 custom settings- very small, *ideal* for a woman's hands, yet again I'm used to the rebel plus the battery grip so...- 1 compartment for CF card and battery- incredibly bright, big and clear LCD, very useful- flip over LCD panel- good battery bundled (1350 mAh versus 1100 for the rebel)- also bundled: 64MB CF, neck strap, 58mm filter adapter, remote control (!) and hood- Good price (same as rebel)- hot shoe for external flash- black \"pro\" lookCONS:- Electronic zoom ring, a bit slow and drains battery- autofocus too slow for wildlife or sports- not as user friendly as previous Canon models- maybe a tad too small for most men hands- smaller cmos sensor than the digirebel- takes like 2 seconds to turn on (I expected less than the rebel, but it's the same)- usb 1.1 (should be 2.0 what the Hell was Canon thinking??)- almost impossible to focus in low light, even with an external flash with IF assistant beam- freezes the viewfinder for a sec when if focuses, annoying- not many additionnal accessories (like battery pack, eyepiece extender...)Bottom Line: I would still recommend it for weddings or maybe all-round, but the next thing I'm buying in about 6 months will definitely be another digital SLR (like the 1Ds), give the rebel to my wife and sell the pro1. It's a great camera, but it's not really \"pro\" like the name and the L lens suggests.Well that's about it, I hope it helps.", "Date": "May 2, 2004"}, {"Title": "Not *quite* as good as I expected...", "Author": "M. Olson \"bone jammer\"", "ReviewID": "R24SUTLWYYQ6XP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a fairly inexperienced camera user, and this is my second digital.  My previous camera was a Canon Powershot A80, which did everything exactly as expected, and is great for the money.I waited excitedly for months to get my hands on this camera, and, as a whole, the camera is exceptional. Image quality is great.  It's also very responsive, and super easy to use (for a manual cam).  You just can't beat the swivel LCD screen, (super) macro mode, and 8mp resolution.There are, however, some things which should be mentioned:-High noise at ISO over 200 (camera does 50/100/200/400)-Autofocus very sluggish, making it hard to catch action shots-Made to hold with right hand, in which it fits nicely.  On the left side, however, there is no \"comfortable\" spot to hold the camera.  Not ergonomically correct.  Even bizarre.  I usually just \"rest\" it on my hand.-No AF assist light for focusing in low light/night time situations.  This is truely bizarre, as my A80 ($300 camera) has one built in, and it works great!  Seems like a ridiculous oversight...-Alot of buttons on a small camera.  Fingers may cramp.By no means is the camera \"junk\", and I've enjoyed it thus far, but felt it necessary to mention these problems for others to consider.", "Date": "April 20, 2004"}, {"Title": "The best of the 8 megapixel digicams", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2VXJTOV8MJWNH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Powershot Pro1 is the best all-around 8 megapixel digicam. It is compact (unlike the Olympus 8080, Sony F828, and Konica Minolta A2); has a fast 28-200 lens (Olympus only goes to 140mm equivalent, Nikon doesn't allow wide angle); and allows for fine adjustment of focal length (Olympus and Nikon use a crude zoom lever that makes it difficult to zoom exactly as you want to). An additional important point is that the Powershot can actually be used in RAW mode: the Olympus, Sony, and Nikon cameras lock-up for a while after taking a picture in RAW mode (this means the camera is not usable for up to 12 seconds after a RAW picture is taken).Perhaps the closest competitor to the Powershot Pro1 is the Konica Minolta A2, but the A2 has an old lens design that lacks the resolution of the Powershot Pro1, and the A2 is much bigger, lacks the high resolution LCD screen on the Pro1, and has limited movement of its LCD screen. The A2 has a very high resolution viewfinder, but with a good LCD screen (like the Pro1), using a viewfinder is not preferable (for me at least). The A2 also has been noted in online reviews to have quality control problems.Comparisons aside, some reviewers here have suggested that the Pro1 has \"slow\" autofocus and that the LCD screen freezes for a moment as the autofocus operates. The conclusion given is that the Pro1 is therefore difficult to use with moving subjects. The difficulty, however, is primarily with photographic technique rather than the camera's autofocus system. Because of the sensor size and lens design, the Pro1 has a large depth of field, meaning that subjects will appear in focus over a fairly large distance. Even at the telephoto end, the depth of field for a portrait (e.g. 100mm) at f/4.5 will be sufficient that you can pre-focus the lens and follow a moving subject easily. The shutter response is very very fast when the lens is already at its focus point. This is a standard technique often overlooked by people who never used a manual focus camera. And this technique is far better than relying on the autofocus system in any of the 8 megapixel cameras: none of them is faster than intelligent pre-focusing! The Pro1 makes this even easier by allowing the user to store a focus distance in the Custom1 and Custom2 settings.This is a terrific camera. No camera is perfect, but the Pro1 makes the best compromises in its class.And for those worried about image noise when looking at photos magnified on screen: this is eliminated from actual prints using any of several noise reduction software packages. Don't be afraid to use 400 speed on the Pro1, put the file through good noise reduction software, and print it. The result will still be very nice.", "Date": "May 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "First affordable Digital I settled for", "Author": "Anant Dabholkar", "ReviewID": "R1ZDUXJV7PCQ2I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had atleast 6 film slr's over the past 20 plus years, and when digital came out over 5 years ago, I waited for the right time to buy. The advantages of a digital over a film camera are obvious, but the resolution and lack of wide angle below $1000 was the main limitation. Now those are no longer as much an issue unless I was shooting something for a large poster.Reasons I chose this camera at this time:1. I pondered the Digital rebel because of the 17 odd EOS lenses I have, starting at the 20 MM wide. I find the wide angle most useful for scenery and indoors, the medium tele for people pics. The 1.6 lens multiplier for semi-pro DSLRs made all my wides except the 20 mm useless. That killed the Rebel idea.2. I find 28 mm my MOST used wide angle since it captures scenery in a way I want to remember it. The 20 is great indoors, but for scenery, it really makes the background too small. This camera has 28 mm.3. I find the 85 to 200 mm range great for people portraits, 85 being best. This has that range.4. I didn't want to end up cleaning dust from my CCD with interchangeable lenses, especially on a camera I want to use a lot. That killed the rebel idea again.5. The L lens really shines, with great colors and resolution. Look a [...] and see for yourself. The color is definitely cleaner and the resolution fantastic.6. For wideangle, the stitch mode really kicks (...). There is nothing as good as Canon's implementation of this concept.7. With digital at 8MP, I can get a better picture into the computer than the best 35 mm slide film and home slide-scanning. Less artifacts, noise and NO DUST!8. Once you get a high quality digital picture into the computer, the possibilities are endless. You can't add resolution in a computer, you need to start with it. You can do things with masks etc. to show highlight and shadow detail like no film could ever do, just not enough exposure latitude.9. At 50 ASA, this camera blows the competition away, in ALL respects. Hence for the best digital shot below $1000, this is the camera.10. Built like a tank, is compatible with all of Canons newer gadgetry, takes filters, polarizers (yes!) had built in ND filter, what more could you ask for under $1000.11. I love the controls. Took a couple of hours reading through the manual and familiarizing myself with the camera.12. Turn OFF the the continuous focus if you are not going to need it, esp. for things that are not moving, focusses beautifully.13. The 2\" 235K pixel CCD in the back is the best Ive seen, probably the same from the 4.5K$ new Canon Pro D1 MkII camera. Plus the 180 degree rotation is priceless. I use it when I do self timer shots with groups, macro etc.etc.<14> Camera does focus bracketing, which I never had on my EOS Elans and isn't available on probably any DSLR. Manual focus is available just in case. <15> I checked moire and noise in Photoshop, none to minimal. Photos need no equalization and noise removal. A little moire removal on things like reflections on hair  (only sometimes).<16> The only thing I might add are..live histogram, but most time I know whats going to be overexposed, the camera only confirms it. Exposure latitude  is wider than film.<17> The Depth of Field, the space in which everything is in focus, is much much greater than in a 35MM film camera. Hence f-stops over F8 that I used with my wide angles is unnecessary. At 28mm, I get depth of field from 9\" to infinity on the Pro 1 whereas I needed F22 on my 35mm camera. This had held me back from buying digital until I dicovered this fact doing some research.", "Date": "May 10, 2004"}, {"Title": "Superb, but beware if you're looking for Point and Shoot.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1LJ2A4KA98N4H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having never owned a high-end camera I was a little intimidated by the various offerings on the market.  I wanted a camera that I could use as a point and shoot and would also allow me to become a bit more \"creative\" with my photography.  I started my research from scratch and had no preference regarding manufacturers, mega pixels, lenses, etc.  I read every professional review and consumer review that I could find.  I finally narrowed my selection down to two models.  The Konica Minolta Dimage A2 and the Canon PowerShot Pro 1.  I made a point of visiting my local camera shop so I could get a hands on look at the various options, feel and performance of each camera.  The salesman was a Minolta aficionado and tried steering me towards the A2 by quoting a multitude of statistics (many of which were erroneous or existed on both cameras). After holding the PowerShot and playing with it a while, I selected the Canon as my future camera and set about purchasing one.I must say that I'm ecstatic with my decision.  The camera weight and size is perfect as is the performance.  During my research I came across two items which I have verified as areas of concern:  1) The camera has difficulty focusing in low light.  This often includes indoor environments with 60w - 100w lighting nearby.  I have overcome this by reading up on photographic techniques and how to manipulate a camera to obtain the shot I'm looking for.  Took me a while to conquer something more than the Auto setting, but I'm doing it now and the low-light focus is no longer a problem.  2) Shutter lag seems long.  In Auto mode, this is a definite problem if you're shooting any kind of action.  Once again, photographic techniques have all but eliminated the shutter lag.  Using the custom settings I have reduced the shutter lag to a point that it's no longer an issue.  I simply make the camera do what I want rather that giving it complete control.Over all, the PowerShot Pro 1 is superb.  It's size, weight and performance are excellent and the options available are surprising.  If you're looking for a camera that will do it all for you, beware of this one due to the low-light focus issue and shutter lag.  If you're willing to take control of the camera, I highly recommend it!", "Date": "June 25, 2004"}, {"Title": "Very good for most people", "Author": "Mark A Heifner", "ReviewID": "RM0LPYQ1VOEF8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a botanist/ecologist/photographer I do a great deal of plant photography. I have used Canon products for years and swear by them and rarely at them. The Pro1, though, leaves a lot to be desired for my purposes. The EOS 10D does far better even with lower resolution. The Pro1, for the purposes I need, is not very suitable. (See my review of the PowerShot S1 IS).  But as a photgrapher who has been published around the world, mostly medium and large format photographs, I think for most people the Pro1 would be a very good choice. It has excellent construction and the image quality is superb with very true color, much better than most. If you don't want to mess with RAW image processing, you can photograph using the Super high resolution Large (gives you a JPG image) and get excellent results that compare very favorably with RAW processing and none of the fiddling with RAW. The availability of a 28mm equivalent wide angle is also very nice and not all that common.  The sharpest aperature to use is f5.6 or f6.3. The images are just a hair softer at larger or smaller apertures. Even the digital zoom will produce a pretty decent image at 14x, but gets worse at maximum digital zoom. Usually digital zoom is pretty worthless, but when you start with 8 megapixels you can still end up with a suitable pixel count after all the digital footwork that goes on in the camera. But generally you are still further ahead shooting at maximum optical zoom (no digital) and cropping, if you don't mind some additional digital manipulation antics to improve things.  So, all in all, I highly recommend this camera to anyone who needs high resolution and compact size. It is a good buy. But for really good macro photography I recommend a digital SLR and a top notch macro lens. If you only do a little macro work and are not real fussy about having razor sharp images then this camera will do fine. Sometimes it would almost match the 10D, but not quite. For all other uses, the camera is great.", "Date": "July 11, 2004"}, {"Title": "Good but not perfect", "Author": "Tim Muir \"electro-fool\"", "ReviewID": "R31B4A11LUTMK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am by no means an expert photographer, but I know a little bit about ISO and aperatures and such.Like the previous reviewer, I greatly anticipated receiving my Powershot Pro1 from Amazon. You can read many professional reviews on this camera so I will keep this short.I thought I should mention that, exactly like another reviewer, my camera had DEBRIS inside the lens housing. Plus the lens appeared scratched or perhaps had some kind of coating flaw. I was extremely happy with Amazon's return/exchange procedure, could not have been easier. Well, I got my new camera and it looked OK, but after several zoom cycles, I noticed it too had some white flaky debris inside the lens. I carefully examined a photo taken afterward and believe it is not affecting the image quality, but I do not understand how an $850+ camera should have this kind of quality problem. There are only 1-2 small flakes visible, so for now I will keep the camera.Other notes: Close-up image quality is stunning. Highly lit environments are a little washed out in auto mode, so you may find you are running the camera more in manual modes to improve image quality.

Peterson", "ReviewID": "R73BT3IIG2VL7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a G3, an excellent camera, and looked carefully at the other 8Mpix cameras before choosing the Pro1.The Pro1 has, for me, the best overall quality, versatility and ease of use of all the 8Mpix offerings. I have not found any trouble with the \"lack\" of an autofocus light due to the hybrid system, though focusing at long zoom lengths is troublesome in nearly all cameras.Flash performance is fantastic, and the Pro1 has ETTL and zoom support with affordable Canon external flashes. The Nikon and Sony can't do this and the Olympus flash is horrendously expensive. I've found that adding an external flash to bounce the light has made a dramatic improvement in my indoor photography, so Canon's external flash support makes a huge difference.", "Date": "August 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "The ultimate Prosumer camera?", "Author": "A. Butterfield", "ReviewID": "R3L5K0IMDDNS2T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "NOTE: My Pro1 has the updated firmware which stops the screen freezing in continuous mode and from what I read below, improves focussing in low light dramatically. Some of the reviews here are probably for pre-update cameras. I think anyone used to a typical point-and-shoot will be impressed by the alacrity of the Pro1's focussing.Like many people, my first couple of digital cameras piqued my interest in photography. But because they were fully automatic, there were times when I couldn't take the shot I wanted.BETTER THAN AN SLR?I fancied a digital SLR to get the flexibility I wanted, but bought the Pro1 instead in the end. Why? Mainly because I wanted a variable-angle LCD screen so I could frame shots in awkward places.DISPLAYS:The 2-inch vari-angle LCD monitor is very good in bright light, and at 235,000 pixels, probably the highest resolution LCD available on a camera. You notice the extra resolution. The viewing angle is more critical than I would like though, made slightly worse because it snaps into certain preset positions which make tiny adjustments impossible at certain angles. I like the electronic viewfinder, which shows all the menu items and settings, shutter speed etc. and has dioptre adjustment. I wear glasses and there's no problem. It's the same resolution as the main LCD and almost always good enough.There's also a top mounted LCD that's nicely illuminated in orange and shows all the camera settings.BATTERY:You might think that the battery life would suffer on a camera with three LCDs, a myriad of blinking LEDs, a heavy lens with continuous focus and a long zoom... but I've found the battery life excellent. You can turn off continuous focus to make the power last a bit longer, but then the screen freezes while focussing.LENS:I suppose the outstanding feature of the Pro 1 is the lens. At 28-200mm equivalent, this is a very flexible zoom. And because the widest aperture at full telephoto is still f3.5, it's pretty usable handheld if the light's good.An unusual feature is that you turn the ring on the lens barrel to zoom, or to focus in manual mode. I quite like this, but to me, it turns the wrong way, and I still haven't got the hang of it! That may just be me though.There is noticeable purple fringing at wide apertures, but overall, this is a splendid lens.SPEED:Not as responsive as an SLR, but pleasingly crisp in action. Low light focussing is the best I've experienced on a digital camera. At the wide angle end, it seems to be able to focus in near darkness with no trouble. Manual focus gives you an enlarged central area on the display and a distance reading. But I found it still wasn't easy to tell if the focus was right. But the camera can sharpen up your manual focus attempt, which is useful.FEATURES:As you'd expect from a camera at this level, it is bristling with features. I won't mention them all. The only one I would've liked that it doesn't have is a live histogram display. Movies are at 640 x 480 but sadly only 15fps and you can't zoom. You get a remote control.ERGONOMICS:Very important on a camera like this. The best bit is the jog wheel right next to the shutter release. It's perfectly placed and you can change shutter speed, aperture etc. You can also use it to scroll during playback. Most often used functions are on their own button, so you very rarely need to go into the menu system. It's very convenient to get back to record mode from playback mode: you just half press the shutter - great. I find I need two fingers to turn the mode dial. You can change the battery and CF card while it's on a tripod.ANNOYANCES:Very few. A non-tethered lens cap that I've resigned myself to losing one day, a strap that always seems to be in the way of the swivelling screen, a manual focus button that's too easy to press by mistake and a screen that freezes momentarily while the camera focuses, unless you're in continuous focus mode. Super Macro mode forces the camera into 4MP mode, though the results are still outstanding.I've heard of quality-control issues with this camera. Indeed, I had to return my first example straightaway because of a CCD fault. I'm totally happy now, but I'd advise you to check yours very carefully when you get it.CONCLUSION:This is a very well built camera that's satisfyingly simple to use, feels good in the hand, and most importantly, has a great lens. The photos I've taken so far have impressed me enormously: they're sharp, with great colour, great subtlety and naturalness. With 8MP, you have all the flexibility you need to enlarge and crop. And with a feature set like this, and the option to add conversion lenses and filters, it's a camera you can grow into if you're moving up like I did.", "Date": "April 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Disappointed after so much waiting :(", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R33YQMTXDGO8O2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really, really wanted to like this camera, but I can't. On the plus side, it takes nice, sharp pictures (although a bit noisy in dark areas), and is built like a tank. But that's where it ends because it is absolute torture waiting for this thing to focus! Honestly, my four-year-old Sony Cybershot focuses faster which I simply cannot understand. Also, the LCD viewfinder freezes for at least one second for every single shot while it composes the picture. This is fine if you're shooting a bowl of fruit, but if your subject is moving at all, you're going to want to pull your hair out!

I am not a professional photographer and my previous camera is a 3MP Sharp VE-CG30U (Canon G1 based, same lense, updated body, but no swivel lcd - very good entry level camera).PROS: I love this Canon lens. Excellent range, wide angle, telephoto.  It has a pretty wide diameter and a shallow focal pane - allowing for excellent pictures with small dept of field (blurry background).  The zoom ring is an excellent solution.  The camera's operation is very impresive, pretty fast power on, focus and save (on CF) times.CONS: The CCD sensor caused lots of trouble for me - has to return my first two, I had bad light spots on the ccd on low shutter speeds (and sometimes visible at 1/60 flash shots).  My Nikon 5400 (similar Sony CCD) also had to be replaced for this.8MP is an overkill, I knew that upfront, but I considered it as an additional zoom - you can crop half of the image and still have enough resolution to print 8x10 !  What I did not realize, is that it creates an overhead of storing larger image files.  plus my 2GHZ P4 machine struggles with the 3MB files just when I try to browse through the directory.  The camera is equipped with a USB 1 (!!!) collection, so expect to wait quite a bit to download your pics (a card reader is mandatory).  After examining the pictures, I don't think that you can print a great shot, if you crop the most center of the image - you are much better off getting closer and reframing.  While the camera produces great pictures with a lot of detail, I don't see much advantage of this high resolution.In addition, the ISO setting on the pro1 is a joke - cannot use anything over 100 !  My cheapo old digital camera did not have as much noise on ISO 400 !  Why did they include ISO 200/400 with this much noise ?  It is unfair marketing.I get dizzy from the evf - it is a great idea, but a nightmare using - flashes and freezes while focusing - even after the latest firmware, unless you use the battery-draining continous focus operation.Note to Canon: I believe all the above problems are related to the Sony produced CCD.  This camera would give equally great pictures with a 5MP sensor - maybe then you could use higher ISO's.Software: While the label suggest professionalism, the camera does not have more settings/customizations than the S1 IS (which also has advanced-mechanical Image Stabiization full 30fp VGA video) !  I was especially diappointed the limited choise of picture size settings.  8MP or 4MP or 2MP or VGA !  All 4:3 modes !  When you print 4x6, all your pics will be cropped at the center.  My old Sharp had 3:2 aspect ratio - just like film, it is very good.  Then your full frame (as you pictured it) fits on 4x6 paper !  The Nikon 5400 also has a 3:2 mode - on the lcd it has a blank band on the top and bottom - great solution.  Canon EOS Digitals have a 3:2 sensor.  I cannot believe Canon could not include a similar option !", "Date": "February 24, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent, with a couple of minor flaws", "Author": "\"wmuma\"", "ReviewID": "R1K6D1ZAJLHD25", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd Canon Digital camera - Powershot G2 and G3 were the previous ones. Took 20,000 pics with them.Things I love about the Powershot Pro1:-takes excellent macro (close-up) photos. The clarity is incredible, especially when using the \"Super Macro\" mode.-Color is exccellent.-Moveable LCD panel on back. I take mostly nature shots - closeups. This allows me to take photos from positions I could never get into without the moveable panel. Shoot from under flowers, raise the camera up to shoot down onto flowers that are above my head, etc.-battery life is superb - about 400-600 or more photos per charge.-the 7x zoom is awesome. From 30 feet I can take a photo of a 2\" diameter flower and see the details of the flower in the resulting pic.-Many advanced features. READ THE MANUAL! You won't discover this camera's full potential until you do.Drawbacks:-The first Pro1 I got had dust and fibers INSIDE the lens. I was able to trade it for another one 2 weeks later after I discovered the flaw - the dust and fibers were only visible when examining the lens in sunlight. One of the replacement camera they were going to give me also had dust inside the lens.-This second unit I had became defective after 2 weeks. The zoom lens started moving in and out with jerks - sticking. So now I am on my 3rd Pro1 unit. Hopefully the problems with the prior ones are not typical!!-Slow focussing and composition, as mentioned in other reviews. Not as much of a problem for me, as I do mostly plant photos. But it has caused me to miss butterfly shots.-The lens cap is a pain to put on and remove. A simple push-on one would've been MUCH better. And I am wondering if the necessary action of squeezing the two little tabs all the time caused the failure of my 2nd unit (lens movement sticking - this action may be always pushing the lens from side to side, and cause the mechanism to wear prematurely?-Have to watch exposures. I find my photos are often overexposed. I have learned the conditions under which this happens, and have learned to compensate for it (which is easy to do). But this was an issue with the G2 & G3 also.-Regular macro mode is poor at auto-focussing. However, the \"Super-Macro\" mode is VERY good at auto-focussing.So far, I HIGHLY recommend this camera. I have taken 4000 pics with it in the 40 days I have had a Pro1, and I like it a lot.It has very advanced features, and even has more features than the Rebel. For example, you can select center-spot metering - can't do that on the Rebel except in Manual mode (if I recall correctly). It is \"pseudo-SLR\" in that the vewfinder displays the same info as the LCD panel. The zoom is excellent, although some people don't like the \"zoom-by-wire\" aspect of it.", "Date": "July 11, 2004"}, {"Title": "A great camera with some minor (but liveable) quirks", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2BT8TH1L96RY2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased a PRO1 after trying a Minolta A2, which I liked a lot but in the end couldn't live with the soft images it took.  The Minolta A2 has rightly been praised for having great ergonomics so I was a little concerned as to whether I had been spoiled too much.  But actually I have been pleasantly surprised by the PRO1.  The buttons are in logical places and it is very quick and easy to shift between play and record modes. The EVF is much better than I thought it would be and seems just as good as the A2 (to my eye at least).  The zoom is also good -- again, I thought I would miss the manual zoom on the A2, but with a little practice the PRO1's zoom seems just as responsive.  There's even a way to get the zoom to rapidly move, a bit like the express option on a car window. I had also seen some criticism of start up time, but it seems fine to me (and faster than my old G2).  Similarly, some people seem irritated that the LCD/Viewfinder blacks out momentarily after taking a picture, but to me this seems OK and something I can easily live with (hardly even notice after a while).Of course the camera is bit on the small side compared with the other 8MP offersings so that takes some getting used to and I could see the camera being a little cumbersome for larger hands.  But I like the fact that the camera is fairly diminutive and not too obvious.  There are a couple of annoyances -- the lens cap seems flimsy and cheap,  but as I intend to permanently mount a UV filter on the camera I'll be buying a 58mm lens cap anyway.  Unfortunately though it appears that the sun-shade cannot be mounted when the filter adapter is attached. The LCD is fantastic -- a little larger than previous Canon models.  The articulation also seems a bit stiffer than my G2 which is actually a good thing and is less prone to be accidentally moved (and subsequently misaligning a shot). Probably the biggest thing to get used to is the AF.  Some have complained that it is slow, and I can see if you are taking action shots it could be.  I'm primarily going to be taking portraits & landscapes so it's fine for me and seems responsive enough, and more importantingly appears to be accurate.  The biggest challenge I've had with the AF is trying to get a lock in low light.  I eventually realized by perusing a few forums that the AF doesn't work well at focal lengths > 50mm in low light.  This is a shame and probably the main reason why I give this 4 stars instead of 5, but it is certainly not a showstopper.  I also found it a little difficult to use in macro mode (at least taking flowers) when it tends to hunt more than I would expect.But the best thing about the camera is resolution -- it really delivers.  Pictures taken in 8MP are crisp and contain an amazing amount of detail.  I specifically wanted a camera with large resolution so I could take pictures of buildings or landscapes and crop. I can tell already that it's going to be possible to make a lot of prints with no or minimal post-processing.  Like a lot of people I don't want to spend hours after a vacation processing pictures in Photoshop so it's important to me to be able to print directly out of the camera.  The PRO1 seems very suited for this.The one thing I do miss about the A2 is the anti-shake.  Also noise on the PRO1 is noticeable above ISO 100 so that means you'll need to shoot at ISO50 or 100.  I went out to my local park tonight and took some pictures about 15-30 mins before sunset and discovered that many of my pictures were blurred even with camera speeds at 1/80 or so.  As I shot with ISO 200 & 400 I also found the pictures just too noisy to be of much use without PPing them.  But that could just be me getting used to the camera, as I've certainly got very sharp pictures in brighter conditions, but if I have use a tripod more often it would probably be worth it.As with everything there is no perfect product, but this camera, despite a few AF deficiencies and quirks, really comes closer to what I was hoping to find in an 8MP camera and most importantingly, creates large crisp and pleasing images.", "Date": "April 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Camera after New Firmware", "Author": "Up North Buyer", "ReviewID": "RMLDSD0FEO2XC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have read all the reviews on this camera and after getting this I would have to say that most of the reviews are wrong about certain aspects of this camera. First off the autofocus lag has improved significantly since the new firmware was installed. While it is still not the fastest it is still very good for most shooting conditions.Most reviews rated its battery life as a disappointment. With the new firmware the battery life is great. I got this camera back in June and I have only had to recharge it 3 times. I have filled my 512mb card about 5-6 times in the period and I use the screen and flash on about 75% of shots.The USM zoom works better too. It is very responsive, and at first I thought that I might not like having a ring zoom but I like it now because it allows you to steady the camera with another hand and it lets you be more precise with zoom.Overall I really like this camera, I tried out the Sony V3, the G7 and the Pro 1. In the end all of these cameras are great but this one had a good feel to it and a lot of great features.

The camera before this was a Canon Rebel SLR and I loved it, but I wanted to see what I was shooting while I was shooting it.  (Nice to know at weddings you got the shot.) This is my first digital camera, and I am overall pleased.  The quality of the images is amazing.  I do notice the flash washing out images if I am taking candid shots.  The red eye is always there regardless of red-eye reduction.  I have yet to see a camera that actually reduces red-eye.  The feel of the camera is good to me.  The battery life is pretty good.  What I am not pleased with is having to take the battery out of the camera to charge.  I work full-time doing something other than photography and have a 1 year old to chase.  There have been times when I am getting everything together for a shoot in my home and the battery is dead. It takes an hour to charge completely (although 5 minutes will get you through the shoot.)  Also - the battery light flashes when you have about 2 minutes of life left.  There's no \"halfway gone\" or anything in between.  It shows either full or dead.Other things I have liked are the tripod mount being close to center of the lens, the software that downloads your pictures is awesome, the flip LCD screen, and the many different shooting modes (vivid, sepia, b&w;, etc.)  This camera has been well worth the money, and bottom line is the quality of the picture, which has been fantastic.", "Date": "January 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good job, but some important flaws", "Author": "jamescroak", "ReviewID": "RNSMH0GP8UVYK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before I purchased the Powershot Pro I had owned both the Canon S40 and the S50, I was happy to find that Canon had continued the same software format and that having experience with the former allowed me to use the Powershot Pro immediately.  First a complaint:  Yo Cannon whatsup with the lens cap!?  After seventy-five years of cameras designed with a lens housing longer than the lens such that one can palm a cap on it without looking, or more importantly remove it without looking, Canon reinvents the wheel, and badly.  The lens housing does not protrude farther than the lens, everything from fingers to clothes to branches touch the lens because it has none of the typical protection.  The cap fits in one position only, locking in with tabs that must be pressed on both sides to remove it.  Simply unusable and probably left off by most users, which means a chronically dirty lens.  The second problem is the long period of time that it takes to calculate an image,  over a second in the best conditions and longer in poor light.  This is a complete nuisance and a reason to shop for another camera if you take motion shots.  There is no such thing with this camera, the subject is off frame by the time it reads the light, etc.  A poor job in this area.  Those complaints out the way I find the camera useful, the movie mode records in 640 X 480 making it useful for something other than a novelty as it was on the earlier Powershot line.  The lens is excellent, in the Supermacro mode it focuses at one half inch and with the 7X optical zoom added onto the 15X digital zoom it is possible to shoot either a frame-filling shot of a finger nail as well as the numbers on an airplane flying at 3,000 feet, and with the same lens!  It is an L series lens and focuses by sound, somehow, so it is always busy readjusting as one moves the camera, also the viewfinder is through the lens making it technically a SLR. The software allows one to use different areas of the LCD to focus so there is no reason not to get the perfect focus every time.  The combination of light metering, shutter speed, F stops, and focal variation are so great one could shoot each shot dozens of ways, and probably will.  Get a big compactflash card for this one.  The battery lasts so long at this writing I can't say how long because I have yet to deplete it; with the S40 or S50 one always carried a spare because they lasted about an hour, not with the Powershot Pro, seems like many hours, at least three so far, stay tuned.The photographs in general are excellent,  as long as the subject is still and it has its second or two to calculate.", "Date": "May 2, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great design, fair image quality", "Author": "B. Greenstone", "ReviewID": "R2ZRUVUDL7165U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is by far the best sub-SLR digital camera out there in my opinion, but it still isn't perfect.  The image quality beats the pants off of what any of my previous Sony's could do.  The color accuracy is much better, and overall exposure is much more balanced.  However, the Pro 1 suffers from grainyness in all images - even ones taken in bright sunlight.  Shadowed areas look pretty awful when you zoom in on them.  But, since we're talking 8+ megapixels, that grain is usually not noticable at all at viewing sizes.  It's only when you zoom in that you can see a large amount of grain, but even bright blue skies look like sandpaper when you start to zoom in.The only other problem I can report is an apparent dead-pixel problem with their CCD's.  I bought my Pro 1 and a few days later I noticed that all of my shots had a spattering of red pixels in areas of the images.  Ends up there were quite a few 5+ dead pixels on the CCD, so I returned it to the store and exchanged it for another one.  Two weeks later I noticed a single (but very large) dead pixel on the CCD.  I haven't dealt with that yet since I need the camera right now, but if that dead pixel continues to bug me I'll probably complain.  So, since I got two separate Pro 1's and *both* had bad pixels on the CCD, I'd encourage you to test your Pro 1 as soon as you get it and look for bad  pixels.", "Date": "February 15, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Hardware Deceiving - Terrible Operation", "Author": "L.

I've used it for candids, landscapes, action, and wildlife.  Previously, my photo experience has been with Canon point and shoot digicams and Nikon film slrs.  It's a bit unfair reviewing this now that it's almost 3-yr old technology, but I noticed that people are still selling this camera for over $1000 on this site.For a \"pro\" camera, it has a large number of critical flaws (listed in order of how much they bug me):1) slow focusing esp in low light.  This renders the camera almost useless for action, and difficult to use for wildlife and even candids, where capturing the moment is everything.  The focusing may be faster in continous mode, but then its always focusing and you have to keep the subject centered-- I like to not be looking in the viewfinder unless I'm about to take a picture.  I don't own a canon accesory flash so I don't know if their focusing aids help.  The manual focusing on the EVF display is too slow and cumbersome to use routinely.2) slow shutter lag.  Even on manual focus, with problem 1 taken out of the picture, there is a bit too much delay to consistently capture the shot I'm looking for.3) Dust gets _inside_ the lens.  I have read that this is a problem with this camera.  Canon was good enough to rectify this when I sent it in, and they even said they sealed the lens to prevent the problem from happening.  My brother has the same camera and this happened within 2 weeks of a trip to Europe-- not especially dusty.  Unfortunately his is out of warranty so I don't know if they will do the same.4)) hi noise at ISO 200 or 400.  I think with commercially available noise reduction software this is a bit repairable.  To be fair, the grain of most 400 speed color film can be as unattractive as the noise of this sensor at ISO 400.  Since digital SLR's with less grain at ISO 1600 are now available, I don't think anyone should be selling this camera for $1000.5) bayonet mount on front of lens scratches filters when used with included 58mm adapter.  My $50 polarizer is now dedicated to use with this camera since with other lenses the scratches are in the optical axis.6) built in flash pics are harsh.  This is a problem with any built-in flash on any camera.  Again I have no canon accessory flash to compare, so I can't really comment on this as a negative for a pro camera.On the plus side, the camera does some things amazingly well:1) super macro is quite impressive, even though 8mp or raw isn't possible.2) the regular macro works pretty well.3) it's a pretty compact solution for a 28-200 lens equivalent.  The equivalent SLR is a lot bigger, though maybe not much heavier.  I don't know how the lens quality of the pro 1 \"L\" lens compares to the non-L SLR lenses.  You definitely won't find an affordable f2.8 SLR zoom lens for an attractive price (not a Canon at least).  The lens is pretty good-- little distortion except at 28mm and little chromatic aberration.  A hint of vignetting at 28mm as well.4) It's ultra quiet.  When I mute all the sounds, it makes only barely perceptible aperature noises.5) the rotating lcd allows for true WYSIWYG composition from different angles, allowing for some stealthy shots and also good for macro stuff.6) really great depth of field (I haven't objectively tested this so I don't know if the 7.2mm objective actually has better depth of field than an effective 28mm on an slr)Taking into account it's strengths and weaknesses, I use the camera for travelling and taking landscapes when I don't want to carry around a big slr for the super wides.  It's smaller and quieter than an slr and better for the surreptious candids, esp with the rotatable LCD.  It'd probably be a good macro-specific camera but I haven't used the macro flash.  For most uses, it can't possibly be worth it if fast-handling, low noise SLR with equivalent lens is available for the same cost or cheaper.  I got it as a gift before lightweight travelling so it was great for that, but I'm looking to buy an SLR now.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "The reasons why Powershot Pro 1>Nikon Coolpix 8700", "Author": "Thitikorn Chancharoensin \"Al Chan\"", "ReviewID": "R2XXKNEJZBN6YK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very picky about the detail of the camera so this review becomes very long, sorry about that in the first place.At the first I ordered Nikon Coolpix 8700 because of the price (at that time there was a rebate of $200). However, when I had the Nikon in my hand it feels not comfortable because on the right hand side, there's a pin sticking out for the shoulder strap, and on the left side you have to be careful not to touch the control panel when you place on your hand. So I ordered Canon Powershot Pro1 to compare whether I should spend about $200 more or not, and the answer was ABSOLUTELY!!!!  These are a few reasons I choose Canon over Nikon. since all of the technical issue such as the quality of the picture, and all other technical stuff are already answered by other people, I will just talk about something detail or you might call it picky. Some people might find this is weird.The 2\" LCD of Canon and brighter and sharper than Nikon 1.8\", I can clearly see the different between the two. However, on the EVF, I think Nikon did the better job on that one. It's not the big different like they have on the LCD, just noticeable.Another option that I like about canon is it got the focus beep and the square in the EVF turn green when the camera got the focus, Nikon doesn't have this option, but it just shows in the screen with the green dot when it got the focus.The manual focus in Canon is way better than Nikon because when you're using canon your right hand thumb is holding the MF button and your left hand is turning the focus ring. This make canon feel like a real SLR.On the charger, I think I like canon charger better than Nikon's because canon charger tells you how far the battery has been charging 1 blink for empty, 2 blinks for 50%, 3 blinks for 75% and become solid when it fully charged.Don't waste money on buying a flash shoe because I will disable the internal flash automatically. I did that when I first got the camera because I thought I would help protect it from dust and etc.You get extra accessories with canon such as remote control, lens hood, and 64MB high speed CF (but no one worry about this one).On the USB issue, both Nikon and Canon got USB1.1 unlike Sony F828. But I just order the firewire CF reader from amazon it's called Delkin Devices READER-24 FireWire Reader and Writer for CompactFlash (...) It transfer my 512mb very fast. I would recommend it over any USB 2.0 reader because they're usually failed.I think overall Canon look more professional than Nikon Coolpix 8700. Moreover, Nikon 8700 and 5700 are identical except the red and grey rubber grip, so some people might think Coolpix 8700 is 5700 which mean people might think that you have 5700 instead of 8700. But if you're carrying Canon Powershot pro 1, for some people, they might know for sure that it's the top of the line digital camera for Canon.For the response on the other member on the small flakes that he has on his camera's lens, I checked out my camera for the flake as soon as I got my camera from amazon.com and found no flake. However, after camera going through after zoom cycle like Tim said, now there's some flakes appear in the lens. I was worried about it quite a bit, but like Tim said the flakes do not affect the quality of the pictures. By the way, I first use this camera when I had my vacation, so the camera went through a lot of zoom cycle and on/off operation. Now there's interesting thing happened, I always checked for the flakes in the lens, but about 2nd day after I first found out about the flakes, all the flakes are gone now!!! I don't know how this happened, but assume the following actions might be the reason:\u201eX I did tap the side of the lens after I found out the flakes, hoping it might fall out to the side of the lens, but I was not.\u201eX The way I placed my camera in the camera bag was a bit awkward. I have case logic bag which is a quite bigger than the camera, I place the camera when it's not being use by having the left side of the camera(from the EVF view) on the bottom of the bag, which made the right side of the camera(the battery compartment) facing up ward. I didn't mean to place the camera in this position but I just thought which position would be convenient for me to have the camera store in the bag, so that it would be easier to take it out from the bag with my right hand.Hope this is helping clearing out some question about the flakes.", "Date": "October 1, 2004"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Workhorse Of A Camera", "Author": "Ricardo M \"Investigator\"", "ReviewID": "RDS6Z8WDXFQ4Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used several digital camera's in the past including more expensive Digital SLR's but this is by far the easiest to use to obtain fantastic results WITH the ease of point and shoot.I think the reviewers that were having problems with the camera's have not updated their camera's firmware and they also have not taken the time to read on how to best take a low light photograph or an action photo.

I own 2 of these little jewels and I kick myself for putting off this review so long-long enough that it's long out of production.  First, let me get it off my chest.  THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING LITTLE OPTICAL MACHINES I'VE EVER OWNED.  There, I've said it. Now I'll get down to the pro's and cons of owning what I consider could have been one of Canon's crowning achievements.I bought the first one in 2008.  I had a love hate relationship with it.  So why be annoyed by something I've grown to like so much?  Well, it is slow and limited in doing what it does. Focusing time, shot to shot recovery, zooming, vga video quality and recording time, and a flip out viewfinder that makes the photo masterpiece you just recorded look like trash.  So what's to love?  Well, it's the indisputable, undeniable quality of the images rendered through that professional grade \"L\" series lens and the high quality 8MP CCD! Bottom line, the photos rival my Canon 60d DSLR with the high end \"L\" grade glass I own.  It will shock you --I mean blow you away -- the first time you see your photos on a high def computer screen or HD TV after viewing them in the low resolution screen of the Pro 1 viewfinder.  I recently slapped a little Canon speedlite into the hot shoe of the Pro 1 and took snapshots at my Granddaughter's Wedding (as a backup to the professional that they hired.)  She (the Pro) had a Canon 40d and a couple pieces of redline glass.  Don't get me wrong, she took some beautiful photos.  But guess what....When we made a side by side comparison of her professional shots and the snapshots rendered by my old Pro 1, there was very little if any difference and in fact, the Pro 1 won hands-down in sharpness, color, and contrast -for some shots--without any touchup whatsoever.  I made a slide show of my snapshots for my granddaughter and she was blown away. Wow Papaw, your photos look better than .............'s.Built like a tank, the capabilities of this little high-end Powershot are extensive.  You can read about them in the specifications so I won't bore you with it.  But I can say this - it is an understated and elegant example of what the Canon folks can do by combining some of their best glass with great electronics in a compact \"bridge\" type non-dslr.  I don't think that has happened very often.  Sure, it's got some drawbacks.  The slow processor, the odd zoom by wire telephoto lens, and the use of the slow compact digital card format, and the low resolution of the articulated viewfinder to name a few.  But I have come to appreciate the unrelenting, undeniable quality of the images to the extent that I save this one for really special occasions like weddings and graduations where the weight and slowness of the camera are worth the patience.  Course, for anything requiring speed like sports or wildlife, you would be out of luch anyway.At one time, I gave my first Pro 1 to my daughter.....I wanted to upgrade to some of Canon's new \"faster\" stuff.  I regreted it so badly that when she dropped it and bent the flash hot shoe and stopped using it in favor of a new (smaller) Powershot, I asked if I could have it back. I then sent it to the Canon store and had the hot shoe replaced.  It's been working fine since.  I recently got worried about what would happen if I lost it or it got broken beyond repair - soooo, I went to Amazon and bought a used one in like new condition for $175 (original costs in the range of $800).  Yep, I plan to keep these little jewels in my stable until I don't take pictures any more.If you can find one in good shape - BUY IT!  It's a great bargain.

It is often more convenient and can help with some really difficult angles. The downside is that it is hard to maneuver.

In general I really like it.Let me start with the downsides first.  Like most small-sensor cameras there is a LOT of noise at high ASA.  And by high, I mean 200 and above.  So I leave mine on ASA 100 all the time.  The result is that outdoors, or indoors with good light everything is wonderful.  But low light...  very long exposures so have a tripod ready and hope your subject isn't moving.The autofocus is very poor in low light;  it hunts back and forth and often can't find proper focus.  Manual focus in low light is tough too.  In good light it focuses properly but is a bit slower than newer cameras, which can be an issue if your subject is moving.Another weakness is the long delay between pushing the shutter release and when it takes the photo.  You can minimize this a bit by pushing the button half way, which will initiate the focusing and exposure setting.  Then when  you push it the rest of the way it is fairly responsive.Aside from these drawbacks, this camera is wonderful.  I love the way it feels in my hands, I love the flexibility it gives me, I love the ability to shoot in RAW, and the ability to put the camera in jpeg mode but switch to RAW for individual shots after you take them (you have a few seconds to do this).I love the way the camera feels in my hands;  the controls feel very natural to me and it is easy to change settings as needed from shot to shot.  It hangs nicely from the neck strap and battery life is pretty good.I LOVE the articulating screen;  it makes it very easy when shooting from very high or low angles, which improve many photos.  It also works great for shooting candid shots of people;  you can put the camera at your belt and compose/take photos without your subjects realizing you are taking their photo.The image quality is excellent in good light.  The scenic photos I've taken with this camera are quite sharp, and 28-200 zoom range is perfect.  So for travel photography I think this is a perfect camera;  much smaller, lighter and easier to carry than an SLR with lenses, and for most travel shots the image quality is comparable.Compared to the images from my A-series point/shoot cameras, the Pro1 is hugely better.  It is sharper, the color saturation is better, the blacks seem blacker and the whites seem whiter.I have not had any problems with dirt in the lens or on the sensor although some have reported this problem.  If you do a lot of photography in dusty/dirty environments beware of this.I wish Canon had continued to evolve this camera to improve the low-light and autofocus systems, but they have not.There was a firmware upgrade in late 2004 that significantly improved the camera in many ways;  be sure your Pro1 has the upgrade.  You can do it yourself easily;  see the Canon site for info.

Any filter screwed on to it - and I tried both a 58mm UV and a 58mm polarizing filter - jams on the adapter. (No, I did not cross the threading!)Once the filter and adapter are clicked on to the lens, it is no longer possible to attach the petal shaped lens hood. Using any other off-the-shelf lens hood, for instance a circular one, intrudes on the image.On all my cameras I use a UV filter to protect the lens from scratching - it is cheaper to replace a UV filter than an expensive lens - but in the case of the Powershot Pro, attaching the filter and adapter, mean that without the lens hood being able to be attached in their presence, any backlit images are compromised by unwanted light hitting the lens.Canon Design team: Go to the bottom of the class for this poor design feature.It has let down an otherwise excellent little camera. With the one adapter supplied jammed on to one filter, an adapter for each filter I use, may be the solution, but it does not solve the lack of attachment point for the lens hood, when a filter is in use...I have complained to Canon USA about the adapter quality and they must be aware of the lens hood issue.They need to  tackle these issues.Postscript: Canon Service USA replied within 8 hours over the weekend to an e-mail complaining about the adapter, asking for a mailing address to send a replacement.

I started with a digital Canon because I'm familiar with the way they think a camera should work, I'm sure a Nikon would have been as good a choice, but I started with Canon.  And worked my way up through a series of cameras to the Pro 1.  If you have never used their `L' series glass, you will be astonished at how fast, crisp, clean, and clear it is.  The 28-200 zoom is nice.  You will get a lot from this camera, but pushing 8 megapixels to a large `professional' sized print is difficult.  Everything everyone has said is pretty much true.The:** Good: L series glass, OPTICAL zoom, good range in zoom, STRONG flash, exceptionally nice smaller prints.  Will take long - tripod needed -shots in the multiple seconds range. can be used point and shoot or full manual.** Average: Battery life is average so have a spare (or two), and I've been told many, many times that I DO need to stick with Canon Batteries by people I respect - so ditch the 10 for $100 non Canon batteries and stick with Canon.  I've been given many reasons when I have my yearly cleaning and tune up of my cameras and lenses (only because I treat them rough and use them in hostile environments (like the Great Basins and Ranges in the Summer heat and dust and the Winter cold and grit and wet).  The best reason I've been given is that non-canon batteries may 1) lose their re-charge life significantly faster because they are often made of re-cycled materials that have not been cleaned up very well, and probably most important, they tend to leak if left too long without use or charge.  This will destroy your camera right then and there - and I have noticed that one bunch of `money saving' batteries DID start to leak (first sign is the copper beginning to turn a greenish brown, before the green really shows up) after only about 3 weeks of charge-discharge cycles. Didn't save much on those batteries, AND I needed to carry 5 or 6 with one in the charger all the time to do a full day shoot. So now I cowboy up for name brand batteries. I don't like it, but people who know say I need to stay with Canon batteries, and all they do is repair optical equipment, they sell ONLY service on things from microscopes to cameras, no tangible products of any kind, and that's about as neutral as you'll get. It doesn't seem it would matter, but it does.** Bad: slow to boot up, hard or impossible to auto-focus in low light, WILL freeze sometimes in low light or low battery, if you accidentally remove the card while it's on, you'll erase the entire card, poor quality large prints, flash often TOO powerful and I have to `bounce' it off a home-made white card double bounce contraption and it almost always needs to `bounce' for inside diffusion and even distribution of light.  But a simple 3x5 card will do that nicely, but side angle bounce flash is nearly impossible -- sometimes you can use a bent 3x5 card, but it's very awkward and often the card will show up in the frame unless you pay very close attention to it, and focusing and holding a card is ALMOST impossible.  Might as well forget wild-life photography, by the time you pull up your camera, turn it on, wait for it to boot, and then get a focus, that Osprey is now on the other side of the canyon, or that deer is most likely behind a tree or rock or has taken it's four bounds and is now just a dot in the zoom lens.  And that Bald Eagle on the fence post about 50 feet away is now in Utah or Oregon at 20,000 feet.  The way you counter this problem is to keep the camera on and not let it go to sleep -- draining your batteries every second. Count birds out, large mammals as maybes, and landscapes as certainties. Portraits are as good as you are in normal light. I don't shoot portraits, so this is a neutral point for me.** EXCEPTIONAL!!!! I got distracted by my dogs while shooting a sunset scene of a Nevada Mountain Range and had it mounted by one of those `spider' pods to the brush guard on my old Toyota Land Cruiser.  I got in and drove away and at about 40-45 MPH hit a small pot hole on the dirt road and heard a funny sound and looked out my passenger-side mirror and saw the black box of the camera rolling across the dirt. Dang!When I got back to the camera there was a very small roundish crack in the top where it had first hit hard pan, then bounced across some gravel and into some sand where it came to rest in an old bitter brush bush.  IF I'd sealed it right away it would have stayed, but I didn't and in about a month the place where it had cracked fell off, showing some of the electrical parts inside, and I sealed this with some plastic and glue.  When I sent it off for it's cleaning a bit early - they said other than the normal amount of grit and dust they'd normally find, there was no other damage to the camera, lens or focusing mechanism. Wow.  Well built is an understatement.THE BOTTOM LINE:1)....I AM ASTOUNDED AT HOW WELL BUILT AND SOLID THIS CAMERA IS!2)....If you want to REALLY learn photography, this is the camera to buy.  It'll let you be lazy and use it as a point and shoot, but you can also move to manual settings, AND it has a macro setting so you get close-up and personal -- and with the L series glass you the best of both worlds: point-and-shoot to almost-true-pro with super fast glass (this means you can hand-hold in lower light and not need a flash).  Every shot is free until you print it. So take the shot, the only way to learn is to take the shot -- the worst that will happen is you'll throw it away. And I have to admit that seeing your image captured right away will improve your ability as a photographer faster than any film camera will, I probably learned as much in the first month of owning this camera as I had in the previous 35 years - but I also read the manual.  AND, this camera will teach you all of the little things you need to know so you can `trick' the brain of digital cameras in general.3)....I've just bought a Canon 5D with a set of lenses and while I have now learned my way through the beginnings of digital photography starting with simple and moving to the top of the `amateur' cameras, I can now move to a mid-real pro camera and know what I need and what I don't.  But I would not hesitate to carry this as a `backup' or use it in places that I'd not want to take my several thousand dollar camera and lenses or lug 5-10-25 pounds of glass. AND only if I wanted prints that were smaller than 11x17.

I would also recomed that you purchase an additional battery for the camera. The reason being is that is is very convenent to have an additional battery to replace the one in the camera once it is low on charge.", "Date": "August 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "terrible focusing/low light capapbility", "Author": "bluenosegirl \"coastalgirl\"", "ReviewID": "R38SCB2YN9ZS4P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace a sony 2Mb digital camera after my first daughter was born. I thought I would be able to get amazing photos. The only good photos I could get were taken outdoors. Focusing in low light is impossible, so don't bother. The automatic flash washes out all photos regardless of settings. The autofocus is so slow you'll miss all good shots if taking photos of children. The macro focus capability is useless and can't focus at all on macro settings. All in all, don't waste your money on this Canon camera, try Canon's other brands which are far superior, ie SD550 or better still upgrade to a digital SLR like the 20D.

They knew when it shipped that it has firmware issues: and I sent it in repeatedly for repairs. I paid $1000 for this piece of crap: and after fifty phone calls (some in tears), begging for a functional camera, and two attempts at repairing it, they finally sent a replacement to me. But it was a refurbished piece of you-know-what, too, and the upshot is that I never owned a working $1000 camera. The replacement is a lemon with the same issues: it can't focus in dim lighting (which my PowerShot G1 did admirably), and the macro doesn't work half the time.After enthusiastically recommending Canons for YEARS, I switched to Nikon. Good move, Ms. Vice President of Customer Service, you evil Borg. I will never buy another Canon again, and don't recommend them to anyone, unless you are a card-carrying masochist who loves to be tortured with unresponsive customer service.

This takes like 5-7 seconds to auto focus.  I take photography at a hockey game for a local team, I am now forced to upgrade cameras because I CANNOT take good actions shots with this, I would have to know where they will be, start autofocusing on the ground hoping that it will focus intime, then finish pressing the button whent he hockey players came around... problem is, if I move, it messes up the focus, plus sometimes even just trying to focus on the ice will throw it out of focus.OVERALLoverall its a great camera for amatuer nature shots, its a bit heavy but you dont need to carry and cant add lenses to it so in overall equipment weight you save yourself loads of pounds I guess.  It does macro fine for me, it does great for still photos, or actions shots that will not move out of your view.  When you turn up the ISO the shots will get VERY grainy VERY quick, it only goes up to 400, which should give sufficient light anywhere but it will ruin the quality of the picture...Upgrade people... please, now I have a powershot pro1 that I really cannot use and is near impossible to sell for the amount of money I need... and I need 800 and something bucks to get the eos digital rebel...Tyler", "Date": "March 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Unacceptable....", "Author": "shazam", "ReviewID": "R2H52HGODQMPM3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Recently, I inherited this camera at my job, to use for conferences and job fairs, and I've been forced to use my personal $250 Nikon to get decent pictures.  The only good news is that I didn't pay for this Canon. Not having image stabilization really hurts this camera when used in low light situations - all shots are blurry.  Fiddling with aperture and other settings helps only slightly.  I've studied the manual cover to cover, fiddled with more settings, and no go.  Of course no one believes me - that a camera that costs this much could take such terrible pictures, (it must be Operator Error!), so I let others snap some shots - then they see the light.

If the camera had been made by Kodak or Sony or Minolta, then I would not have been surprised at its akwardness and lack of quality. This is a cheapo piece of garbish, I would not pay more than $100 dollars for it, despite the 8 megapixels advantage. The lens is useless, you can not focus with it. The buton placement does not make any sense, it is not ergonomic either, it feels unconmfortable on your hand. The telefoto lens is too heavy and throws the camera forward. It vibrates when you take a picture. It was a mess. Do yourself a favor and buy any other Canon model, they are all excelent except for this one.
