{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Camera upgrade", "Author": "John Fortino \"John F\"", "ReviewID": "R1ADF5479VD1U8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this camera to replace one in a video security system at my house. The one it replaced was a 480 line camera and had 36 LEDs. This was a definite up grade. The image, even at night is improved over the previous camera. The LED field of view is very focused and narrow, but very effective pointed at dead center of field of view. I needed to see a wider angle of vision at night, so I have had to add a IR flood illuminator to the camera. Don't take away from the camera for that, it sees quite a bit, I just needed to see a bit more than what it was designed to do.Setting it up was kinda a pain, as the instructions sucked. i did contact the seller and they were great about offering some advice on proper setup.Two tips.  You have to remove the housing to adjust the focus and zoom. When you finally get it set how you need it, use some kind of waterproof grease (I used some from my mountain bike supplies) to grease up the o-ring sealing the housing. This will keep moisture from getting into the housing and fogging up the inside of the glass.  Also, Rain-x on the outside of the glass to keep it clear during and after a rain.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "No picture pitch darkness", "Author": "Mizani", "ReviewID": "RQ4BOCEJ3GYNW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought three of these cameras to install in a hospital in Kenya. Connected them to a Q-See QS408 DVR and placed a Pinecom long range IR-LED lamp alongside two of them. One camera is mounted facing a gate that is lit through out the day. The other two cameras are in the back of the building facing an un-lit road. Daylight images for all cameras are clear where you can discern facial features at least 5m away. However, the downside for these cameras is that they do not switch to night mode when it gets dark. Both cameras at the back of the building show pitch darkness. Probably a setting I have missed. Will monitor them for a couple of months to see how they cope with the tropical climate...", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Clear but useless in the night", "Author": "Justin \"JC\"", "ReviewID": "RCLN8NOGJWKH7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera's image quality is great in the daytime but pretty useless in the night because it doesn't turn itself to night mode (B&W;) I guess and the distance it can see is even shorter than my Dome camera and it's very dark and blur in the night, but usually for a outdoor camera what you want it can watch out for you 24 hours a day so I will say this is a pretty useless camera unless you are using it for super short distance (10ft) or indoor.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera.", "Author": "G. T. Olson \"GTO\"", "ReviewID": "R3RY7P2US8KZN9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Works great, nice large viewing angle.  Taking it apart to adjust the angle/focus is a bit of a pain, but it comes with the necessary Allen wrench for the task, a nice plus.  The LEDs for illumination are alright, but I have this installed in a spot with outdoor lighting, so I don't rely on them much.  (I'm of the opinion that most LED night illumination is god for about 10 feet unless you install the industrial external LED lamps like the Pinecom S-8100 Long Range IR LED Illuminator).  The housing is sturdy and so far no issues with nights down to about 15deg. F.  Good purchase and I'll consider another one of these if the need arises.  Five stars if it came with the option for no LEDs at all.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Junk! Did not work except for viewing one inch from lens.", "Author": "J.
