My friend and I were going to be going snorkeling and did not want to be leaving our phones, ID or credit cards on the beach.  So I bought a couple of plastic pouches made for being in the water, but I kept wondering how I would know if water was getting in. So I bought these. Each time we went into the water, we had these absorbers inside our pouch.  We figured it would absorb any drops that made it through.Only once did we have leakage and that was her fault, not the plastic pouch, as she didn't seal it right. But the 3 little moisture absorbers did their job.  It was only a few drops, but they took care of it.  I'm very pleased!", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works as expected", "Author": "W.

The indicating beads change should be orange when you receive them. If not, the package seal was broken. The orange beads will turn green as they absorb moisture.

Remainder seems to be useless plastic beads.  also, bags dont appear to be perforated.  I tested the product in a humid bathroom evironment to no effect.  The few orange ative beads in the bag absored noting and did not change color.  Afer 2 days, i ripped open a bag an put into a cup with small amount of water.  Walla! the few orange active beads turned dark.  However the 98% of all other beads proved inert -no dessicant action.  The product was inexpensive but if it doesn't work its extremely expensive.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Plastic Beads?", "Author": "J.P.", "ReviewID": "R2ONDYUBITZ8DL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Near as I can tell, its plastic beads, not Silica Gel.  I wanted some dessicant (clay or silica) for an ordinary application.  I could't believe the price for these silica packs, cheapest i've seen, and now i know why... they don't work!  I have had them in still damp air for about a week, the air is still damp (to condensate), and the indicator beads are still orange (should turn blue to indicate the silica is adsorbing moisture, its not).
