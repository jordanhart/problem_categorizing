{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great wide-angle video camera", "Author": "Reuel Robertson", "ReviewID": "R26CJX5SFJ00TI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a rear-view camera to aid in docking my 40-foot power boat.  I selected it because it is rated for outdoor use and it provides a nearly 180 degree view (170 actually).  I have been very impressed. I moored in a tight spot the first week I had the boat, with only 55 feet available to back out my slip and turn 90 degrees to exit.  I was able to move within a few feet of the boats behind me with confidence, because the video image quality is excellent in daylight, and the wide-angle shows so much of one's surroundings.  I viewed the video image on a RayMarine E120, which has an 800x600 pixel resolution.  The camera provides enough resolution that there is no discernable pixelization on this display.  The Speco CVC-638/170 is an excellent product.2013 update: over 5 years later and I am still using this camera regularly, and I continue to like it.  In the winter I occasionally must take off the outside protective lens and wipe off condensation with a soft cloth.  If the sun is low and the camera is looking directly into it the bright sunlight overwhelms the rest of the field of view.  That's it for caveats.  I am impressed that after 5.5 years of being outdoors continuously in WA state, this wide angle video camera still operates reliably.", "Date": "May 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "D.
