This is probably the easiest one I have ever used. You are able to pretty much pop the batteries in it and start taking pictures.  It is very compact and easy to slip into a side purse pocket or a pants pocket with ease.  I would highly recommend this camera for someone like myself who just wants to be able to point and shoot and not have to worry about too many \"bells and whistles\".", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is a great camera!", "Author": "Joanna", "ReviewID": "R39H4RZVXMUC4W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera a few days ago and it was a very fast delivery! The camera came in perfect condition and i am very well satisfied with the whole delivery in general. I was so anxious to get this camera and when i finally got it i automatically fell in love with it although i had some trouble learning how to work it at first but i officially got a hang of it and its definitely worth the money. The camera looks really expensive, and the picture quality is GREAT. I can see everything clear on the LCD screen and it works great. Its good t keep some extra battery's in handy but overall this is a really neat camera for teens and adults.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great For The Money", "Author": "El Lippo The Trumpet Man", "ReviewID": "R3EVTGOPCG2JOJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For my purposes this camera very well suits my needs. Although a tad confusing at first, it's similar to my Sony 'point and shoot' camera (the one that uses floppy disks for storage). So I more or less relied on my intuiton to use this camera. What helped reduce the confusion was for me to download the user manual (PDF) which is more comprehensive than the quick start guide included with the camera. While waiting for delivery, I studied the manual. I forgot which site that I downloaded it from; but I'm certain that if you do a Google, you'll be able to locate one or more sites.Both with indoor and outdoor shots, the images were very clear. Despite the cons I read concerning the flash, I had no problems taking indoor images with the flash. Being an avid Paintshop Pro user, I was able to tweak any flaws with success.My biggest concern is that the camera is a battery hog. To help, I am awaiting delivery on a set of rechargeable batteries and recharger. The set is available thru Amazon. As long as I keep two AAA's in the charger, there should be no problems - especially since I don't take all that many pictures. One item that I'm looking for is a wrist strap which is not included with the camera. It did come with a USB cable which I never seem to have enough of them around the house.For the money, I have no regrets buying this camera.", "Date": "November 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Would have liked it if it lasted...not meant for kids", "Author": "Rene C. Szatkowski \"szatkowskifamily\"", "ReviewID": "RKAANM95F633Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for $40 for my 7 year old daughter's birthday.  She wanted a camera and after using her little kids one so much, we decided a cheap real one would work.  Out of the box (well, the blister pack) it worked great.  The camera took some great pictures...clear and crisp.  I was quite impressed.  Then, all of the sudden (within the first few days) we noticed that every picture was blurry nor matter what we did.  I messed with the settings assuming that a setting had changed.  In doing so, I noticed that the front lens was sharp feeling on the edge.  The focus portion of the lens had completely come out!  I sent it back for a refund.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Dissapointing", "Author": "lk", "ReviewID": "R34TH5S2SYXOAM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We ordered this camera for our son from SANTA and it was VERY DISAPPOINTING!!  We read all of the previous reviews and they seemed pretty positive.  We got the camera and it looked cheap in the package.  When our son opened it Christmas morning and took it out of the package, I have to say it's probably one of the cheapest cameras I have ever seen.  It was very lightweight.....felt like it was made from plastic.  Although it states that it zooms, there is no actual zoom button.  You have to press another button several times to get it to zoom.  The picture quality was terrible as well.  We had bought our other son a camera,too, but didn't want them to have the same one.  We purchased him a Kodak Easy Share, which was the same price as the Polaroid......but in a totally different league of camera.  The Kodak was very easy-to-use, takes good quality pictures, and feels like it's well-made.  We returned the Polaroid and purchased another Kodak in a different color through Amazon.  The return was very easy, but our account has yet to be credited.  We got an e-mail from Amazon stating there would be a full refund.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great gift!", "Author": "Darian", "ReviewID": "R12W79IF13QWV4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This made for a great gift for my mother who is not very technically inclined.

It was a Christmas gift for a 6-year-old who's had some digital camera experience.  The limited functions (like \"delete\" and \"zoom\") can be tough to use, especially for her.  And there really is no help from the \"manual\" if you can call it that (barely a flyer).But the primary issue I have with the camera is the limited storage space and the unbelievable battery consumption.  It's 2 days after Christmas: we've been through 2 sets of AAA's already.  Not a rechargeable camera.  It's a 5 mega-pixels, but used at factory setting, that means you can only store 4 pictures.  My hubby managed to adjust it, so now she gets about 10 \"keepers\" before having to connect to the computer to download.  There is a slot for an SD card, but I would've thought the 16 MB of built-in storage would've been fine to start with.  Now we'll be heading out to pick up a card so this camera meets our needs better.It seems to take decent pictures, though we haven't printed any of them yet.  We did learn that we couldn't get clear pictures without adjusting the slider between close-up (flower icon) and far away (mountain icon), based on how each picture was framed.All in all, I'd say it's okay as a first camera, but only if mom & dad are willing to supervise a LOT and to spend an extra $20ish for a reasonable-sized SD card.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not a bad little camera", "Author": "Timothy Mott", "ReviewID": "R1E38S2Z626IN3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have purchased five of these to give to my technicians to capture pics of equipment on the job sites.  I prefer something a little nicer for my personal use, but for basic picture taking, they work quite well and I will purchase more as the need arises.  The good thing for me is that if one is lost or stolen, it is not a major tragedy.Uploading the pictures was almost effortless with the included cable.  There is not anything that I really do not like about this camera.

At a price of under $50 even if it were damaged within a few months it wouldn't be a big loss. The camera was afordable for my purpose. This isn't the sleek star of casual photographers, it is big enough for little hands to hold on to and sturdy enough that if it falls on the floor a few times the whole thing won't come apart like some of the high end credit card sized cameras.The other plus with this camera is the size of the screen on the back. He loves being able to see the photo he has just taken without having to manipulate buttons and arrows. He gets a kick out of being able to take a picture of the family dog and running to show his parents the great picture he just took.I also bought him a Kodak digital picture frame so he can have all of his great pictures rotate though the program and see his handywork.The only 2 minor problems are that the camera itself only holds about 4 photos so I had to send memory cards with the camera. Two, 2GB cards did the trick; one for the camera and one to use for loading the digital frame.This camera is also not top of the line in picture quality but decent. Picture quality could be affected by the ability of the 5 year old photographer as well.

You would do better to purchase a disposable camera. I got this as a Christmas present a year ago, and I have not uploaded a single photo from it. When I try to take pictures indoors, no matter what, they always end up really dark and blurry, or way too bright and washed out. I have tried changing camera setting to help this, but they did not work. It still takes crap pictures. Maybe my opinion is biased because the last camera I had was a nicer $100 camera. Casio Exilim or something of that sort.Also, another issue, I don't have the most steady of hands. This camera will be the worst decision you have ever made ESPECIALLY if you cannot hold your hands perfectly still. I beg of you, invest a little more money into a better camera.
