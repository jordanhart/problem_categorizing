{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Probably best in class, worthy upgrade", "Author": "Kevin K. Fosler", "ReviewID": "R2WEIQ1N06EG2Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned each new version of this camera since the Powershot S2IS.  For me this is a worthwhile upgrade over the prior version, the S5IS.I'll start by saying that I am not a digital camera \"power user\".  I just want good quality photos without a lot of hassle.  This camera provides that, yet also provides a lot of room for growth with plenty of custom settings that I can use if I want to learn how to use them in the future (for example, aperture priority).Pros:-  In initial testing, the face detection technology seems to work well.  I can take a self portrait now and the lighting comes out very good.  I think the technology has gone from buzzword marketing to true usefulness.-  One side benefit of the face detection technology is that it enables the camera to intelligently take red-eye out of pictures without using the red-eye reduction lamp.-  The flip-out and rotating viewfinder has always and continues to set this camera apart from its peers from other companies.  It allows for less intrusive candid photos and has many other advantages.-  Thankfully, the SD card door is separate from the battery door as it was with the S3IS.  Thank you Canon!  There are times that I just want to take a few pictures, and now I don't have to open the battery door to take the SD card out and put in my PC's card reader.-  Low battery warning.  I think this is the first version to have that and it's very welcome.-  28mm -- I will never get another camera without wide angle built in.  I have the Canon Elph 880IS too, which is a very powerful \"pocketable\" camera that complements this one well.-  Sharp 20x zoom.  Pictures turn out very good even at high zooms.  In an indoor-lit apartment, I can read fairly small print from a photo taken all the way across a room -- it truly is amazing.-  The picture quality is better at higher ISO's than previous models.  Each model improves on this and this one definitely continues that.  I haven't tried out the \"I-Contrast\" setting (on vs. off) but I can say that in some outdoor pictures that I have taken detail is good in shadow areas.-  Finally, a standard lens-cap.  It doesn't have a tether, but you can buy a cap attachment from a camera store that sticks on the front of the cap.  The one that I got has an elastic band that goes around the base of the lens.  I also got a better lens cap which can now be done since it's standard.-  Controls ...  I like the new placement of the controls such as dedicated on-off button and display button.  I don't think I will like the scroll wheel but time will tell.  For those not familiar with this camera, there is a dedicated video button so that you can take video quickly without having to mess with the controls.-  Weight and shape.  I liked the shape of the S5IS a little better.  This one seems too \"boxy\" and the grip seems too abrupt.  It's bigger and heavier but not in a way that matters.  It's expected with the new lens.The only thing I would have liked to see improved is the size of the rotating display.  It's usable, but the 3\" one on my pocket SD880IS is much better, and competing cameras offer a larger display.  In order to get a larger display though the electronic viewfinder would probably have to be eliminated which is something that many wouldn't like.  I'd rather have a larger display.I don't know if the compressed movie mode results in less quality because I didn't take movies with prior versions of this camera because the file size was larger.  I like that videos take up less space now and I will use the video feature of this version.Canon released a camera similar to this with HD video capabilities but it's not available, as far as I know, in the U.S.  Check the Canon website for more info. if you want to research that.There is not a way to screw filters on this camera as there was with the optional lens adapters available for the S5IS.  It seems that Canon could have easily done this by threading the end of the lens but maybe I am missing something.  I anticipate that Canon or some other company will come out with an adapter that will allow filters.  My main use of filters was simply to protect the lens.I don't know if the software is improved because I don't use it.  If you want date / time stamps on your photos, you need to do it via software.If you like this camera and are interested in a great pocket-sized camera to complement this one, check out the SD880IS.  It has many of the same features such as the Digic 4 chip, face detection, wide angle, I-contrast, and in addition it has a beautiful 3\" display.Update 10-26-08-  I previously commented that I thought the shape was too boxy\" and the grip \"too abrupt\".  After using the camera for a while I have grown to like the shape because it helps keep the camera more steady and helps prevent dropping it.  There is a ridge below where the index finger is, and above the other 3 fingers holding the camera.  That helps keep a good grip on the camera which makes it steadier while shooting and helps prevent dropping it while carrying it around.", "Date": "October 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sweet Big Little Camera (Updated April 29, 2009)", "Author": "Rachel Barr", "ReviewID": "RUNUPGFJC0J1W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a second update.  It comes after several months working with an SX10 IS.SHORT LISTPros:Excellent resolutionVery good noise controlImage edge and corner sharpnessLess than average color fringingTrue wide angle and phenomenal telephotoiContrast for highlight/shadowVari-angle LCDFocus frame size adjustmentBrightness, contrast, sharpness and color settingsGreat movie mode with stereo soundHot shoeLens hoodCons:Slow f5.7 maximum aperture beyond 100mmTendency to overexpose (though this can be an advantage--see below)Low light autofocus issuesMinor lens distortions and color fringing at either end of zoomTedious control dialLCD hard to see in bright outdoor lightZoom sounds audible in moviesIN DEPTHA semi-pro photographer with 30+ years' shooting experience, I am respectful yet rigorously demanding of my photo equipment. I push parameters, often absurdly so, but the SX10 doesn't seem to mind it one bit. For its price point, features and class, this is a stellar offering, and I highly recommend it.The camera is solidly built and, although hefty for a point-and-shoot, feels well balanced in the hand.  Controls are intuitively placed and easy to find with your fingers--no need to take your eye off the LCD or viewfinder when you've become acquainted with their positions.Performance is excellent in all but low light, where autofocus and shutter lag are sometimes at issue.  The camera powers on and is ready to shoot very quickly. Image recording time is swift, especially with a Class 6 card, and in reasonable lighting focus is both swift and accurate.  Resolution is superb; image stabilization is best in class.  And the sheer zoom range--wow!Point-and-shoot capability is great. Open the box, install batteries and memory card, and fire away. It's so easy, kids can do it.  And given a little time and tinkering, in its creative modes the camera really shows its chops.In this review, you'll see several references to existing-light photography. It's my personal preference; I only use flash when I must. So I've spent a lot of time working out the angles for that sort of shooting. What you won't see is anything more than a cursory remark about action photography. It's not something I've used this camera for just yet.In this model Canon addresses several issues inherent in the \"S\" series--most notably noise and dynamic range.  Though still noisy at ISO 800, about half the images I've shot at that setting have been okay for prints, and nearly all are very good at ISO 400.  Pictures taken between ISOs 80 and 200 are clean and excellent.  Noise reduction at higher ISOs does degrade saturation and details a bit (more noticeable at the longer end of the zoom, especially in low-contrast lighting) but not enough to abandon the higher sensitivities altogether.Both edge and corner sharpness are very good at anything but widest angle and full zoom, and even here sharpness is much improved over the S5 at ANY focal length. In truth, no zoom lens of such wide range has edge-to-edge sharpness at its focal extremes.Color fringe is a mixed bag.  Depends somewhat on the focal length, ISO, aperture and shutter speed.  Overall, fringing is not that bothersome.  At both the widest angle and full telephoto ends you'll see some colored edges, most noticeably in areas of high contrast. Bumping the zoom lever once or twice makes all the difference.Some barrel distortion occurs at the wide end as well, though not too bad. It's only noticeable where there are obvious vertical or horizontal lines (again, a bump or two of zoom, and lines strighten right up). These issues can of course be corrected in most photo editing programs, although not in Zoombrowser EX, the camera's supplied software.Achieving focus in certain lighting can be iffy and sometimes fails. Changing the focus frame size will usually remedy this. When it doesn't, manual focus feature comes to the rescue. Fortunately this feature is improved in the SX10. The autofocus issue seems linked to extremes in contrast, whether low or high, rather than actual light available.  Low contrast, low light situations present the most difficulty, but a couple of times my copy has struggled and failed in high-contrast, intense lighting, too. Lowering the ISO helped.If you prefer existing light photos and stay at ISO 400 and under, at focal lengths beyond 100mm you'll need to reduce shutter speeds due to narrowing apertures, and action shots get tricky.  For stationary subjects, though, the camera can be hand-held at speeds as low as 1/6 sec to produce sharp images without flash--phenomenal.  This works best with image stabilization set to single shot rather than continuous.It IS a good idea to carry a mini-tripod or monopod. The SX10 tends some toward overexposure, though, which works to your benefit; an increase in shutter speed not only balances exposure but also results in fewer blurry hand-held shots. So, although it's a good idea to have one handy, the tripod probably won't be needed too terribly often.The camera's built-in flash is quite good to about 17 feet. There's also a hot shoe for dedicated external flash; and with flash employed, the playing field broadens significantly. I've not yet encountered a situation where I couldn't get a picture when working with flash. A few times manual focus has been necessary, but by golly, I got the shot!That big lens does zoom--boy, does it ever! Furthermore, digitally zoomed images are surprisingly detailed.  Image stabilization is so effective that in good lighting sharp, hand-held shots are VERY doable at maximum magnification--a whopping 80X. The hardest thing about shooting at that length is just keeping the subject in your viewfinder!Canon's vari-angle LCD is thoroughly spoiling--it cooks. There have been many times when I simply wouldn't have gotten a keeper without it. An articulating LCD not only offers the flexibility to shoot no-hassle self portraits, overhead, ground-level and other awkward-angle pictures, but it also gives an extra measure of stability in composing your pictures. Just fold out and tilt the LCD and hold the camera close to your body with your elbows tucked in. It's a much steadier stance than the traditional arms-out, eye-level method. Makes for some good stealth photography, as well as opening up new perspectives (think children and pets). And it's a real boon for tight spots and macro work.  My only quibble about the LCD is how difficult it is to see in bright sunlight. (Fortunately, the electronic viewfinder is excellent, so you can shoot, no matter what.)I really appreciate the ability to reduce the focus frame for capturing little details (it's nice to have a camera that \"knows,\" for instance, that you're going for the antennae of a moth and not its entire body).  Better yet, you can zero in on the eye as the sharpest point in the frame, making for stand-out people, bird, wildlife and pet photos. Pictures are so much more arresting with this capability.About iContrast:  while dynamic range does increase some, it's not a magic wand. With it turned off this camera does pretty well (though not d-SLR well) at highlight and shadow details.  At least in my copy, pictures shot with iContrast are sometimes processed with a dull, gray-blue cast that no color or white balance setting offsets. So I keep iContrast disabled during shooting, unless the lighting is pretty extreme (the user guide suggests this approach). I've found iContrast of greater benefit, editing images in Review mode.  Colors are more vibrant this way; the pics don't get that gray-blue cast.SX10 pictures are not as contrasty as those from Canon's previous ultrazooms, especially at longer focal lengths. This is not a design flaw--you now have the option to adjust contrast as a custom function. It's found in My Colors. Options for adjusting sharpness, saturation and skin tones--as well as red, green and blue channels, are available there, too.Often pictures lacking in contrast are simply the result of overexposure. If you're using one of the camera's built-in My Color settings, in average to bright light exposure compensation frequently helps, adding vibrance to your images and upping highlight details. The exposure compensation button makes this easy.  On the other hand, photos captured in overcast and other low-contrast lighting conditions nearly always lack contrast, regardless of how you adjust exposure or which iContrast setting you're using. I personally don't mind this, as contrast can always be boosted in post-editing.Even if you're a seasoned photographer, I can't stress enough: READ THE USER GUIDE even if you've owned one of Canon's previous superzooms. While the SX10 is very similar to its predecessors, there are also some big differences. When I got mine, I didn't actually look at the guide for almost a week; until I did, I grew steadily more disappointed. And just knew that Canon had lost their marbles.If you're a full-auto kinda person, you'll probably love the camera without reading through the whole manual--that is, until you make your first movie. If you haven't read the advanced instructions for video capture, here's where you'll probably encounter dissatisfaction. Be sure and read the advanced guide for movies on pages 87-90 (English version). For instance, you can lock the focus--very nice--no more fading in and out. But the thing I think you'll really want to know about is a way to brighten movies when zooming.  (More on that in a bit.)It's when you move beyond point-and-shoot into the creative zones that an in-depth look at the advanced guide gets essential.  The good stuff is in there all right, just waiting to be tapped, but you'd practically have to be psychic to know how to work it.  It's not a hard camera to control, but some of its features and the procedures for using them aren't exactly transparent. You're paying for a pretty amazing, feature-rich camera. Instead of bashin' or smashin' the darn thing, do yourself and the SX10 both a favor. Read up on how to use it. It's well nigh impossible to get the best from it til you do.In its auto modes, the camera selects ISO, aperture and shutter speeds which almost always work very well, although you may occasionally bring home noisier images than you'd like, and the white balance can sometimes be just a tad off.  It also means employing the flash indoors fairly often, so if you prefer point-and-shoot, existing light photography you really may want to consider a different camera.About Movie mode, in my estimation the only down side is the lens noise it records--an audible clacking sound during zoom. In every other respect, movies are outstanding. Before I bought the camera I had read user complaints about dark videos, and that concerned me. Sure enough, when I got the camera and gave it a whirl, my movies were just bogus beyond the 100mm tele mark.Then I read the advanced guide--duh.  And found that Canon has made provision for the lens's narrowing aperture as you zoom in. When you notice the image growing dim, you can increase the exposure--during recording!  It's very easy--a press of the exposure compensation button and a twirl of the control dial is all it takes.  Works like a charm.  And that's not the only new enhancement (earlier I mentioned focus lock). Before beginning a movie, you can also set preferences for white balance and color. With stereo sound, volume adjustment, a wind filter and such enormous focal reach, the Movie mode is a great addition to an already magnificent camera--why, it's just gravy.If anything ever fails on my copy, it'll probably be the control dial. Learning to use it was pretty trying. The dial is thin and slippery, and the mount is too shallow, almost flush with the FUNC/SET button it surrounds.  The knurls on the dial are barely palpable and provide little traction.  Worse, the dial tends to slip while it's turning. Applying enough pressure to engage it can inadvertently change the ISO setting or switch the camera to Manual Focus or Macro mode. My touch has improved with time and practice, but it took way too long to get the knack, and it's still not surefire. The thing's just plain tetchy!Despite its idiosyncracies, I'm very glad the control dial is there. The SX10 is a camera that offers many adjustment options for making the very most of its incredible abilities.If the dial were more easily engaged, and the zoom were silent during video capture, this camera would earn my resounding five-star rating. It probably deserves one anyway. If I didn't use the creative modes almost exclusively, the control dial wouldn't be such a bother. And if I weren't so persnickety, the lens sounds in video probably wouldn't be an issue, either. The dial needs improvement, though. Because this camera falls in the \"advanced\" category, aimed at the photo enthusiast/advanced photographer, and because it is one of the most-used and important features for that kind of shooting, I can't rationalize away its mediocre design and just love the dial anyway.  Canon simply MUST improve on future iterations of their SX cameras, and I expect they will!", "Date": "November 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Happy with the SX10 IS", "Author": "Mark N. \"Intrigueable\"", "ReviewID": "R2EDYQC50B4IWJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera replaced my old Olympus C2100, a formidable 10x zoom camera introduced 8 years ago that started the mega-zoom race. Have played with the SX10 IS for a week now and very happy with it.Below are what I like:-It uses regular \"AA\" batteries. Never buy a camera that uses specialized batteries no matter what people may tell you. Updated 6/27/09: this camera is so power efficient that it can take 600 photos on a single set of AA rechargeable batteries according to a leading consumer magazine (no other camera can even come close, non).-It has a useful 28mm wide angle lens. This means you can include a whole group of people in a picture without standing too far back(such as in a small room). Most cameras (I say 90%) do not have lens this wide.-You can zoom (optical & digital, with audio) while taking movies. Many cameras do not allow optical or audio during movie taking.-It takes SD memory cards which is most popular (plentiful, cheap). Do not settle for cameras that take any other type of memory cards.-It has a rotating LCD display.-It is quick to take (and view) pictures and movies.-Picture and movie quality (with stereo audio) is superbly competitive to any other high quality cameras.Below are what I don't like:-No grip: this is one slippery camera. I like its size and weight but its grip needs to be designed accordingly.-The LCD display is very easily scratched. Do not wear this camera with a neck strap with the LCD facing out, because your shirt buttons will scratch the LCD. Immediately put a protective screen on this LCD first; there are several protective screen or tape products available.-The lens has no thread so you can't put on a lens filter to protect it from smears and dust.-The lens cap has no tether or tether hole so there is little you can do to attach the cap to the camera. Canon, what was you thinking?-I wish it can record movies in widescreen 16:9 VGA. It does not have HD movie feature but I don't need HD, I only wish widescreen VGA.Currently there are several 20x zoom cameras available, such as the Olympus SP-570UZ and SP-565UZ, Casio EX-FH20. I've tried all of them, and eventually chose the Canon SX10IS as I think it gives you superb features and quality for an unbelievable price.", "Date": "October 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Some minor quibbles, overall a terrific camera", "Author": "Terry R. Umbenhaur \"Video Gaming Ninja\"", "ReviewID": "RRDF60XD4YIKL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been looking forward to the \"S6 IS\" coming out this year (after skipping out on the S3 and S5), and now it's out, with the name \"SX10 IS\".  I think Canon wanted to show that this camera is a huge leap forward from the S5 IS, and it certainly is given the new specs.Compared to the S2 through S5, the zoom is now 20x optical starting at 28mm instead of 12x starting at 35mm (much wider shots), as well as a 10MP sensor, up from 5-8MP, and Digic IV (instead of Digic II and III) for improved shots.I tried out the demo model in the store, and some differences I noticed were:- The camera is much taller and deeper to accommodate the huge lens, and does not feel as good in my hands as even the S5- The body of the camera is very smooth compared to previous models, but it feels bulky compared to the S5- The button layout is COMPLETELY different, there are no buttons on the front of the camera, MF and macro buttons are located in the back, you now press a button to turn the camera on and off (instead of turning a jog dial), the 4-way directional pad has been replaced with a clickable scroll wheel, also to enter playback mode you must press a button instead.  I do not like this layout, but it does offer the advantage of being able to enter macro and MF mode using your right hand only.- After taking a shot, you can view very detailed information about the shot (ISO, aperture, histogram, etc) which is a nice add-on- The lens is marked on the top with approximate zoom levels and focal lengths- Unlike the S5, the battery compartment is again separated from the SD-card slot, which is good- The picture quality is better, thanks to improved high-ISO quality, so the pictures come out less blurry than on the S5.  The sharpness and auto-focus at 20x is very good, with no visible distortion at any zoom levelI did not see the intervalometer function in the menu, so I assume it is still gone as it was removed in the S5, also no RAW support, and there is no custom firmware available for the SX10 (since it is Digic IV), look for that in the future.  Movies are in .MOV format instead of .AVI, still 480p, and still one of the best \"camcorders\" around.The MSRP is also $100 lower than the S5 was at launch, making this a terrific bargain for a 20x superzoom with Canon's great quality.  My only concerns are with the size of the camera and the button layout.  However, the huge zoom lens makes up for it, and the fact is it is still much smaller and lighter than a D-SLR plus wide-angle and telephoto lens.  Overall, you can't go wrong with this camera, the quality is superb.", "Date": "October 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera for those with no patience for lenses and tripods", "Author": "Bryan K. Nowak \"Doodledad\"", "ReviewID": "R1LNOEDYIF3V2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was the proud owner of a Canon S1 IS very soon after it was released. I loved the compact size, additional lens attachment, and zoom capability. Its quality was nice for the time but soon the megapixel race was on and 3MB images were left in the dust. I opted next for a Canon Rebel XT and spent $$$$ on lenses, flashes, memory, bags, tripods, etc. Don't get me wrong... I love my DSLR, but when I heard that the SX10 IS was available I did not hesitate to purchase it for my wife who was beginning to be a photo-junky like myself. The 20X zoom lens reaches from 28mm (wide angle)to 560mm (very long range) and is incredibly compact. The body is about the same size as my XT. It has the bells and whistles of a more sophisticated DSLR yet can operate as a point-and-shoot for those with less complicated needs. We love Yellowstone so this will be a magnificent addition to our arsenal of photo gear. Forget the time setting up a tripod since it has built-in image stability. Forget changing lenses for the scenery shot versus the distance shot. The image quality is very good, has more megapixels than my Rebel, and even fits in my wife's purse (though bulky). I give this camera an A+ for what it was designed for. My wife's only complaint is the need to keep up with a lens cap that was connected by a strap in earlier versions (S1-S5). Way to go, Canon! Buy it! I don't think you'll be disappointed. I would even recommend it for the novice to intermediate photographer who is traveling and does not have the space for all the extras that a DSLR requires.", "Date": "November 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Few rivals among digital cameras", "Author": "P. David Moon", "ReviewID": "R159MM2CULQ44J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon SX10 IS is a very impressive superzoom camera.The ergonomics of the SX10 are excellent.  The camera feel substantial but not overly heavy in the hand, and the fingers wrap around the grip very naturally and securely, leaving thumb and fingers well position for the controls.  The menus seem very intuitive to me - almost all the settings are where I expect to find them.  (This may be partly because I have owned several A-series cameras and know the Canon menus system, but I recall thinking with my first A-series camera that the menu distribution made a lot of sense.)  The menu settings include a customizable menu list that can be set to include the users most frequently accessed menu items, edited to the order of the owner's choosing, and, if desired, set to be the default menu on initial access of the menu functions - overall a means of truly customizing the camera to one's own particular needs and uses.  Many users will join me in applauding the presence of focal-length markings on the lens barrel - a nice feature that means a lot to more experienced photographers but is notably lacking on the models of most other manufacturers.The range of capabilities of this camera is remarkable.  Begin with the lens:  28 to 560 mm equivalent in 35-mm terms.  This means that, from about 12 feet away, I could on Christmas morning make one exposure that encompassed the room, all the decorations, and the day's several celebrants, and without moving, fill the frame with a single ornament on the tree on the other side of the room.  Both are remarkable in their own way.  One of the things I have missed in moving to compact digital cameras from high-end 35mm cameras was a seriously wide angle lens.  A 28 mm lens gets a lot of wear and tear in the kit of a serious 35mm shooter, begin used both indoors and out to capture wide expanses.  Having a 28 mm short end of a zoom is vastly different than calling 35 mm \"wide angle.\"  On the other end of the scale, 560 mm is a lot of lens, and one would seldom attempt to hand-hold that much lens with a conventional 35 mm system.  Image stabilization, however, allows sharp shots hand-held with the long lens.  Image stabilization is said to allow a gain of 2 stops in exposure latitude.  The usual rule of thumb is to reach for a tripod whenever your shutter speed is slower than the inverse of your lens length (i.e., 1/30 sec for a 28 mm lens, 1/60 for a \"normal\" 50 to 55 mm lens, 1/250 for the long end of an ordinary zoom in the 210 to 270 mm range.  With practice, photographers can often beat that rule by one stop, but with IS I have beaten the rule by 3 to 4 stops with tack-sharp results.The reason that Canon digitals attract a lot of gray-haired photographers with extensive 35-mm experience is because most of their cameras have easy access to shutter- and aperture-priority modes and a fully manual mode in addition to the several programmed modes on the dial.  There are times when us old geezers look at a prospective shot, identify potential exposure problems, and solve them by selecting a specific shutter speed or aperture value, or sometimes both.  Such settings remain easy to access and manipulate with the SX10, and the other specialized program sets are well-conceived, if rather standard, and equally easy to access with the control dial.  The control dial also has a setting that can be customized to give quick control-dial access to a set of features and settings that the owner anticipates using frequently - thank you, Canon, for recognizing that your customers have brains of their own.The software has some pretty gee-whiz features.  Face detection seems to work very well, and the camera can pick out all the faces in a frame and it allows you to select one to be highest priority in focus and exposure.  Even more remarkable is a delayed exposure option that counts the faces in the frame when the shutter button is pressed, then recognizes when a new face (the photographer's) shows up, and fires two seconds later.  I am not sure how often it will be used, but the very capability is a remarkable bit of intelligence to be present in a camera.  Focusing can be set to face-detection or a defined-zone system that starts with a central square and can be shifted by the photographer.  Exposure options include evaluative, full-frame center-weighted, or spot metering, and the spot meter can be linked to the focus frame.  The focus frame can be blown up either prior to shooting or in review to check focus.  (I found this feature to be a bit distracting to composition, so I turned it off in the menus but I can imagine situations in which I might reactivate it.)  Auto focus can be set to continuous or shutter-button activated; servo focus off or on.  The flash is activated to raising or lower it; auto and forced flash is available; a red-eye lamp is pretty ineffective and can be turned off, as can the focus-assist beam; flash can be synced to first or second curtain.  Stitch assist includes not only the usual left-to-right and right-to-left options, but also top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, and a four-shot two-dimensional rectangle.  I can go on about the settings, but the reader can access that information by reading the owner's manual at the Canon website.  The key point is versatility - you can set and override darn near everything on this camera.Picture quality is quite good.  Ten megapixels is a lot to cram onto a small sensor, and some folks have reported some chromic aberration, or purple fringing.  Chromic aberration is worst at sharp edges of high contrast.  I have made deliberate attempts to produce chromic aberrations, and have been inconsistently successful, having produced the dreaded purple fringe only on some shots, and visible only after extensive enlargement.  I have not yet had a picture that I thought was significantly affected by chromic aberration when viewed at a reasonable magnification.So is the SX10 a perfect camera?  No, but it is awfully good; its capabilities rival the best 35 mm cameras in many ways, and its digital capabilities allow it to offer features impossible with 35 mm cameras, like stitch assist, creative color options, and contrast controls.  I would love for it to have  larger sensor, but we all know that the manufacturers are going to protect their D-SLR lines, and the technical aspects of designing lenses small enough for a compact camera that still serve larger sensors are said to be quite formidable.  A wider range of aperture settings would be nice - I am sure that everyone would like a little more speed, and that would allow further narrowing of the depth of field for portraiture, but my appeal would be for another stop or two on the smaller side, so that the 28-mm setting can be used with knowledge of depth of field for foreground-to-infinity sharpness in landscape works.  (Few people realize these days that Ansel Adams worked mostly with f-stops of 64!)  But, all of you old 35 mm devotees out there please admit it - if you were ever crazy enough to dream of a 28-560 zoom with this good of an optical quality, you would have killed to own one, and you would have expected to mortgage your house to be able to afford it.So overall - extreme versatility in hardware and software, very good image quality, and a highly user-friendly design make the SX10 difficult to exceed in a single-lens camera.  Multiple lenses and a larger D-SLR body add some image quality and perhaps some additional capabilities, but the additional abilities will be quite esoteric for most users, and the difference in image quality will seldom be justified by the expense and, more important on most days, the extra bulk and weight of a multi-lens system.  The SX10 should receive serious consideration from anyone desiring a high quality digital camera but reluctant invest in a D-SLR system.", "Date": "December 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Seems Perfect for My Use", "Author": "Kenneth Depree", "ReviewID": "R34NMDINIIRZOG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm in first days so can't give detailed report but I can say it is a big step ahead of my Powershot A620, that was a very satisfactory camera.  But the 20x was a big inducement since it will help me in kind of shooting I enjoy.  There are many more controls than I am used to, and it will take time to make full use of all.  But I am already benefitting from such controls as iContrast.  Today I was trying to photgraph a waterfall and was frustrated by a shadow in the center because sun not exactly as I would have liked.  I turned on iConrrast and took the shot. The shadow was gone and the rocks it was hiding were clearly seen.  I don't think I could have done better if the sun changed position.  I have also taken photos with the zoom and achieved results far superior to what I was getting with previous camera.I think there should be threads on end of lens so that I could use filters, such as a polarizer.  However, Lensmate is fabricating an adapter that will permit the use of filters.  But the absence of threads is one of reasons I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.This is definitely a camera anyone who wants an advanced non-SLR camera should consider.  For me, it seems to be the perfect camera, giving me many of the controls of an SLR but without need to buy and carry lenses.UPDATEI have taken several hundred photos since writing my first review so can now say it is perfect for my use.Some reviewers complain a bit about the weight; I like the weight.  It weighs noticeably more than my Powershot A620, but I like the substanial feel when I use it.  I don't shake more with this camera, if anything less, and the image stabilization lens takes care of that.Some have commented about the camera being slippery.  I have not noticed that.  Don't know why, but to me the SX10 is not a slippery camera.I am really pleased with the wide angle lens, something I did not have on the A620.  I didn't know what I was missing.  Likewise the 20x zoom. What a difference compared to the 4x I was using.  This is great for distance shots, I am also using it like a macro lens.I know now that I made the right choice.  I have most of the options I would have if I purchased an SLR, but at a much lower price.The camera isn't perfect, but no camera is.  I'd like threads so I could use a polarizer, and I don't like the wheel used to change the aperture value or shutter speed.  It works, but is more time consuming than the way it was on the A620.I like the camera so much that now I feel as thought I was nit-picking when I rated it 4 instead of 5.", "Date": "October 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best all around \"Super Zoom\"", "Author": "Setter Dog \"Jack\"", "ReviewID": "R2B1YOTNUPHVRD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my SX10 for about a week and am very impressed with it's versatility. I tend to read all the user reviews I can before making a purchase and did that with the SX10. I also tested the camera with my own card in a local store and compared video and stills on the same card to the Pany TZ28. I am very interested in video and was attracted to the Pany because of its HD video. However, in testing, the SX10 was overall very superior. It has excellent color, unbelievable IS, smooth zoom, very nice stereo sound, and fool proof autofocus. I found the Pany to be weak in all those areas. I prefer the better \"all around\" video to the HD of the Pany.Initially, I was spooked by the reports of a slow lens during medium to max zoom, 5.6 to be exact. I read enough reports to be convinced that the slow lens would not be especially restrictive for me due to compensation in ISO and speed setting, made possible by the excellent image stabilization. I have found the lens to be just fine, even at max zoom. I also found that the lens is fast enough for indoor non flash photography. I even tested the \"ISO 3200\" setting, which requires a lower mp setting. I printed these out at 3x5 and the pictures were very good.At first, the LCD seemed dark. After I turned up the setting to bright, it was better. After using it awhile, it seems fine. The EVF is large and bright, the best I've seen.When the professional reviews come out, there will certainly be knocks on the slow lens. In my opinion, this is more of a theoretical limitation than a practical one. If you like the camera, don't be spooked by the slow lens comments. If you're not sure, buy from Amazon with their excellent return policy.One really solid feature is the wide angle of the lens. This was not a feature I thought I wanted or needed. Now that I've seen the wide angle, I'll never have another camera without it.There are many other features that most will enjoy, including the dedicated video button, AA batteries, custom settings etc. I think average and very serious photographers alike will be happy with the SX10.", "Date": "November 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fixing problems that didn't exist!", "Author": "Chris Nibley \"mr. fahrenheit\"", "ReviewID": "R354T9KRM27Z8P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have owned and loved every S series camera since the S2 and so I was very apprehensive when I learned that they had made dramatic changes to the next iteration.  The size is bigger, the zoom is longer, video files more compressed and the button layout has been switched around a good deal.It's not that I resist change, I just believe that if you've got a good thing going - DON'T MESS WITH IT!  But I had already promised my photo-loving little sister that I'd give her my S5 when the new one came out so I figured I had to at least give it a try, so I went ahead and ordered it.I was most worried about the new video format as that was my favorite feature of the previous cameras, so as soon as I received the SX10 I ripped it out of the box, threw a 4gb extreme 3 memory card in and hit the record button.  4gb provided a little more than 45 minutes of the highest quality of video on the new .mov format, while on the S5's .avi, I got a little less than 30 minutes, but I've never been one to complain about the size of the files - just the quality!  I walked around, trying to test it in as many ways possible, bright light, low light, wide open, fully zoomed, inside, outside, etc.  I could tell that this camera had a more difficult time staying in focus when I zoomed in and out than the previous S cameras, but it wasn't appallingly bad, and I figured if that was the worst thing, it would still be a wonderful camera.  So I watched the video on my computer and even though I was annoyed with having to use quicktime and found it a little less convenient (.avi files are displayed in windows with a picture of the first frame, making them very easily identified, whereas .mov files just show the quicktime \"Q\", meaning I would have to come up with catchy titles for all of my many video clips), I had to admit that the video quality was still quite good, and I think the audio is even a little better (that might just be the camera though).At this point I'll talk about my impressions of the body handling.  It is definitely larger than the S5, but still not nearly as large as any SLR I've ever handled - it still has a relatively compact feel, expecially considering it zooms all the way to 560mm!  The grip in the right hand does feel a little weak and slippery, but I didn't ever have a problem with it slipping.  In the left hand though, it actually feels quite nice as the larger lens protrusion gives you something to hold on to, including some very functional ridges along the bottom.  So I'd say the ergonomics are very decent.  The buttons are placed fairly well (I'd switch the play button with the function button) and they all feel nice.  The wheel I hated, but I'll get to that later.So it barely passed the first test, but I still wasn't convinced and I cleared 6 hours from my Saturday to really give it a thorough examination.  I also brought my SD1100 just to have something to compare the pics and vids too.I tried testing every limit of this camera as I stalked a crane, observed an ant colony, tried (unsuccessfully) to catch fish as they sprang from the water and just enjoyed a wonderful day among nature.  Within the first five minutes I had come across two fairly serious issues.  The colors and exposure of the viewfinder were terrible; things that shouldn't have been blown out were, and I had a difficult time composing a shot as nothing looked nice!  The second problem came when I switched to manual (my preferred shooting method) and realized that the wheel had actually made things more complicated as now you have to adjust exposure and shutter speed on the same wheel and switch between them by pushing a button, whereas before up-down (on the 4 way selector) did the exposure and left-right did shutter speed.  The interface has been improved but that was little consolation as I found this to be very frustrating.But even all of this could have been forgiven if everything else was great.  The flip screen was as good as ever, so I pushed on.When I was finished I was actually feeling pretty good.  I really enjoyed the extra zoom on this camera and I thought it handled very well.  I had my reservations still, but I felt like I could get over them and learn to really love this camera.  Not to mention I was really excited about some of the pictures I had taken and wanted to get back to my computer and see how they really looked.This is when things got ugly, pun intended.  I've read all the other reviews and I know some people say this camera produces sharp pics, throughout the entire zoom range, but I have to disagree, strongly.  At the long end of the zoom, pictures look like there's a slightly filmy sheet of glass in between my subject and me.  Any bit of cropping and this becomes very pronounced.  The NR on this camera is very strong and any high-contrast, straight lines were severely deformed.  Almost like the mirage effect only more blocky.  Wide open, the pictures just had no detail and looked just...  bad.  I'm so glad that I brought my SD1100 because I was really convinced when I started looking at my comparison shots, that the SX10 needed to be returned.  The shots out of my 165 dollar point and shoot looked really sharp and pretty, while the same exact shot out of the SX10 looked completely emotionless and stale.  I couldn't believe it.  I double and triple checked that the nice shots were actually the SD1100 but I assure you they were.In all fairness I did get about 8 really nice shots with the SX10, but that was out of more than 200, and I know had I been using my S5 I would have had a much higher percentage.So now I don't know what to do.  It seems kind of silly to buy a camera that I just gave away and right now I'm kind of disillusioned with Canon.  I might try the Fuji S100FS.  I hope this helps and if you do decide to get this camera - good luck.", "Date": "October 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Reality check", "Author": "Michael T. McCaffrey \"sumofan\"", "ReviewID": "R2H62MCM2T6SWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "REALITY CHECK! I am a \"camera freak,\" I just love the things. I own the SX10 (and previously a stack of other digital cameras ... starting with that SONY MAVICA with the 3.5\" diskettes a LONG time ago), and love it. I previously owned the S5, and it was also excellent. I bought the SX10 for the awesome LENS CAPABILITIES, and have not been disappointed whatsoever. It takes magnificent pics, has that enormous range, is COMPACT, and has that \"heft\" to it that gives it the feel of a \"serious\" camera. Now: for the REALITY CHECK: I just bumped into the Canon 40D and 50D models at a local store. You've seen them: big, hefty, big lcd (without the cover the SX10 has ... can already visualize the SCRATCHES from shirt buttons, etc.), big lenses with those ridges on them that seem to beg you to pick it up and zoom in/out. Then I remembered: I bought the 30D some time ago. Bought all the lenses, external flash, cards, batteries, case, etc. Took it home and, after the battery pack was charged, went into the picture taking drill. I was shocked! A cheaper camera that I had took brighter/clearer pics than this EXPENSIVE get-up I just bought! I took a stack of pics with both: same result. I brought that set back to the place where purchased and that was that. There is no doubt that the 30D was worth the price, to demanding pros, but not to me. And this is the point I am trying to make: for the AVERAGE 'JOE' or 'Jill', you probably don't need all the bells 'n whistles these advanced DSLRs certainly deliver. If you are NOT a pro, NEEDING to manipulate a zillion settings manually and exchange lenses to match what you want to accomplish, this SX10 is probably gonna be PERFECT for you! You will not have to buy an array of EXPENSIVE add-on lenses (read the reviews for the 50D, for example, and you will see that super camera is, in the end, \"lense dependent\" ... that is: the end results will depend on the quality of \"the glass\" you have attached. This can get to be a VERY expensive proposition for all but the very serious pros). If you, like me, just want GOOD PICTURES without all the fuss, then ... in my very humble opinion ... this SX10 is probably all you will need for the remainder of your time on the planet :-) (I will admit, after putzing with both the 40D and 50D, I found it hard to walk away without buying one/the other. It's almost impossible to not be overly impressed with their great appearance, obvious wealth of options, and \"heft\" value. But, remembering my experience with the 30D, and the fact I obviously was not ready for multiple lenses, and the complexities involved with high-end cameras, I walked away). You can read the attached excellent reviews on the SX10 to find all about batteries, external flashes, bags, etc.Wishing to add a comment/two about certainly real concerns that run through these reviews: LOSING THE LENS CAP and DROPPING THE CAMERA. For the initial concern: go to RITZ CAMERA, for instance (AMAZON probably also sells this), and buy the QUANATRAY LENS CAP LEASH. It affixes to the lens cap and the camera body, problem solved for $1.99. As far as DROPPING the thing ... DON'T!! I use the CANON WRIST STRAP (bought mine via EBAY) and really like it. A thin over-the-neck strap came with the unit (which I don't particularly like), USE IT! But, do ensure the LCD SCREEN is COVERED when walking around with that neck strap to not scratch the lcd with shirt buttons, etc.UPDATE:  2-17-09:  I'M BACK ... again. I could not resist the urge to get another SLR. I bought a real GOOD one, bought more lenses, flash, etc. AND, just like the one I brought back before, I BROUGHT THIS ONE BACK! The BOTTOM LINE is: THE PICTURE. This expensive array did NOT take better pics than the CANON SX10IS! I am sticking with this GREAT Canon FOREVER! It does EVERYTHING ... and in a wonderful small package. No lenses to lug around and have to change as the scene demands ... just zoom on from 28mm to 560mm(!) without missing a beat.

Hughes", "ReviewID": "R2TOQXKGIS2BYP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was a long time user of the Canon EOS SLR's and I loved them.  I say that only because readers should know I am an experienced photographer.  I make this review after using this camera for about six months.  I've had plenty of time to put it through its paces in various situations.First let me say that I'm not comparing the SX10IS to an SLR but rather to my Panasonic DMC FZ20 with 12X zoom Lieca lens.  The Panasonic is an excellent camera, by the way and I recommend it highly.The Canon SX10IS camera has been a big disappointment.  It was purchased mainly for wildlife photography.  The  20X zoom works fine, but its bad points far outweigh the one good feature this camera has.1. First the lens.  The images are soft, not as sharp and crisp as the ones from the Panasonic.  This could also be the auto focusing mechanism.  Near, far, where ever the subjects are, the focus is soft.2.  Camera design is poor.  Buttons cover every available surface of the camera's body.  My small hands just cannot hold the camera without pushing one of the numerous buttons that cover the camera's surface.3.  I wish they had not attempted to cram every conceivable feature  into this camera.  More is not always better.  The menu is a nightmare to navigate.  No changing settings quickly to capture a bird in flight.  Thankfully they left out the wash and spin dry feature but that is the only thing missing.4.  The optical viewfinder, which you need to use when shooting wildlife (especially if you are a former SLR user or if you wear glasses), is very poor.  The view is fuzzy and the viewfinder is very small.5.  The camera body is cheaply made.  Handle it very carefully.  For example the door to the memory card is hinged with cheap material that will easily break with much opening or a slip of your fingers.6.  When holding the focus at 20X waiting for a subject to turn just the right way the camera makes a chugging sound and the image jumps.  That can't be good.These are my main complaints about this camera.  Some advice:  Don't just order this product online.  Hold one in your hands, do some trial shots.  Try to use it as you would in your everyday photography before you purchase it.  Look at other camera models and compare before you buy.Updated:  The camera died just a little over a year after I purchased it.  This is the last Canon I will own.

The DSLR is used for serious photography and the A720 for informal family pictures and things like fishing. As I am getting older I am finding that the DSLR outfit is getting harder to carry so I was looking for a lighter outfit when I did not want to carry it. At first I thought that getting auxiliary lenses for the A720 would do the job but found it too bulky and inconvenient. Then Canon came out with the SX 10 IS. I got the first one my local dealer got in. It is far more versatile than the A720 but only slightly larger. It covers the complete focal length range I need for almost all picture taking needs. The quality of the pictures is slightly better than the already very good A720 at most ranges. At the extreme telephoto end it loses some as expected. Of course it is not as good as the DSLR but how can one expect a camera that sells for under 400 dollars to be as good as one that was over 1000 dollars? I was able to get close to the DSLR quality with a little help from my Photoshop Elements.The camera is light for what it does and very convenient. I like the variable angle viewing for odd angle shots as close to the ground and the electronic viewfinder for bright situations. The electronic viewfinder is best for telephoto use as you can hold the camera steadier. The image stabilizer works all the way out to the 560mm equivalent but I recommend taking several pictures just in case. I like the fact that I don't have to carry extension tubes for close ups.

Well the obvious is you can't change lenses but with such a large zoom and super macro why carry around all that stuff just to take hobby shots?2. The sensor is never going to be as great as the higher end cameras, but it does a darn good job if you know how to work your settings and use a tripod.3. You can't shoot raw.  Again this is for the person who likes to take photos rather than switching out lenses, cleaning innards of the body, and sitting in front of the computer tweaking all day.That being said if you're looking for a more \"professional camera\"  go for the new Rebel (I believe the new one has live view that the older models don't and that is a real plus.)Okay so shooting at anything above 400ISO gets noisy.  My solution - use a tripod for longer exposures at a lower ISO or use flash when possible.The zoom is great and though you do lose some quality there is an image stabalizer, you will get shake -- again use a tripod or monopod.The thing is so easy to use, I never even read the instruction manual.  It's all right there on the camera, you just have to play around with it.Burst mode is kinda slow, but again it's under $400 camera -- there are going to be some trade offs for the all-in-one-point-and-shoot.USE the scene settings, they are marvelous, and can actually help train you on how to set the camera manually. The indoor mode is fantastic at setting the white balance.The best situation for any camera is lots of light so expect noise, blur etc in darker settings.  Get yourself a flash -- Speedlite 430ex or better if you have the cash. I am still waiting for mine, but if you like to bounce flash off the wall behind you do some more research on it.  Get a diffuser and/or bounce the crap out of it.  Experiment and play.

If I need to film then I'll get a film camera.Getting back to the camera: I've had mine for a bit over a week by now and shot over 400 photographs.I'm definitively NOT a power user, but I do know a bit or two regarding what constitutes a good photograph: if I like it then it's a good one!This machine makes almost all shots look like good ones. If you don't want to bother about anything, just select the AUTO function and zoom to the point of getting in the picture what you want. Period.If, like me, you like to tinker a little (or a lot!), it has almost all the functions that you might wish for (and, perhaps, some more that you didn't know existed).When I say that it's close to perfect it is because:a) The shutter cannot be programmed for a lapse greater than 15 seconds. If you want to shoot stars or some other night pictures, this might be a bit of a concern. I would have liked the shutter to be fully programmable up to infinity.b) The low battery alarm only comes on when you're dangerously low on power. By then it might be too late. I would have liked a battery level indicator that tells me at all times what the level of power is so that I can take precautionary measures (like buying some more batteries ahead of time).c) The continuous shooting mode, when you have selected the 10 Mega pixel resolution, is slow. I was shooting a \"corrida\" here in M\u00e9xico and action was a lot faster than what the machine was capable of capturing. Most certainly the 0.6 seconds that are specified need to be improved (perhaps up to 0.2 seconds or less). If someone tells me that I can get a faster response by lowering the resolution, my response would be: what's the point of getting a lot of low resolution pictures? If I'm shooting something it's because I'm interested in it in the first place!If I had to resume this machine it would go along these lines: It has almost everything that you might want but doesn't force you to use it: it leaves you the freedom to be the type of photographer that you are.Not much else that I can add.", "Date": "November 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon SX10-IS, best in its class", "Author": "Joseph B. Prozinski", "ReviewID": "R4LD8F7HZKXON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After many weeks of research and reading of reviews on multiple different brands and models of cameras, trying to find a replacement for my Sony P72 which I was unhappy with before it broke, I settled on purchasing the Canon SX10IS. Checking out some review sites that showed pictures taken with the differnt cameras, the pictures taken by the Canon SX10IS were better than any pictures taken by other superzooms in the same conditions and settings. Besides good picture quality, it also has all the features I was looking for in a digital camera: full manual controls, a camera that wasn't small and easily lost, AA batteries, and good macro and wide angle capabilities. When I was looking for the camera I didn't realize I actually desired a good zoom capability as well. In my first actual use of the camera at a baseball game where my son's class sang the national anthem, I found myself thanking myself for having gotten one with 20x zoom. I was able to get good pictures of him by home plate while I sat in the outfield nosebleed cheap seats. I'm loving the outstanding zoom capabilities.In all of my tests and real world use of the camera I've not been let down. It performs just as well as the reveiwers said it would. I switched to rechargable AA batteries, but I wasn't able to drain the four alkaline AA batteries that came with it, before I replaced them before the earlier mentioned baseball game, and I took about 150 shots with the alkalines. I've taken video and about 200 shots with the recharables and haven't yet drained them. I do have a backup set of recharable batteries for when I really get to some extended photo sessions, but I don't see needing more than the one extra set. I have no complaints about its battery life.I was also very pleased with its image stabilization. I was able to take pictures at extreme zoom that I know I wouldn't have been able to take clearly without it. I also took some macro photos without using a tripod, hand held only, and got some very clear results.I'm glad it didn't come with a small memory card like some other people complain about. My old Sony came with a 16MB Sony card which was all but useless, as I could only get 12 or so pictures on it. Nobody has a use for that small a card. The SX10-IS not coming with one allowed me to get one of the size I want and not have to be saddled with a wasted card.My only complaint is that it is fairly heavy and you'll definitely want to use the neck strap. You won't want to hand carry this camera around for long periods of time.I do not regret for an instant purchasing this camera. I know I would have been unhappy with other models had I chosen differently. It's my first superzoom and with its similarity and functioning similar to a DSLR, it has me seriously thinking about taking the plunge into the DSLR realm at some point in the future after I improve my photography skills. In the mean time there are some third party add ons that can expand it's capabilities to be more DSLR like until I decide to take the plunge.", "Date": "May 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love it - but purple fringe still there", "Author": "N. Oliver", "ReviewID": "R2IWG57SGF6ZIK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I adored my old Canon S2 IS so much that when it got dropped in the ocean there was really no question about replacing it with another Canon superzoom. I take a lot of wildlife pix, and the availability of a 560mm lens in a small, light, inexpensive package made the selection of my new SX10 IS pretty much a no-brainer.The trick new features like evaluative color balance and the histogram-in-viewfinder are easy and intuitive to use, but it's that incredible lens that really makes the package. It's not perfect - any lens that's so compact has to have some chromatic aberration: there's purple fringing visible in high-contrast areas of the images. It all depends on how closely you look, and how picky you are. But it's a fair trade, considering that the long lens allows me to capture images that I couldn't even consider with the average DSLR. Not to mention that the size, weight, and cost of DSLR's means that they stay home on most casual outings.Go ahead and price a stabilized 500mm lens for your SLR, and after you recover from fainting, you'll appreciate how much this little guy offers for the price. Amazingly, I paid exactly the same for my new SX10 IS that I did for my S2 IS several years ago.Downsides: I miss the time-lapse feature, or \"Intervalometer.\" The package is heavier than my old S2 IS.

Hardcore travelers like myself know the convenience of throwing a camera in a case or backpack, and the hassle that the weight, care and feeding of an SLR can pose on such trips.Fortunately, what I've seen so far is that the high quality of zoom shots is setting a brand new standard with this new camera from Canon.  Earlier \"super-zoom\" models, or those with zooms in excess of 10x or 12x, suffered from image quality problems as long zooms strained the limits of the tiny processors needed to capture light and reduce the effects of vibration. All these negative effects increase exponentially with each increase in zoom power. It used to be that only the large lenses and higher sensitivity power of expensive SLR's solved this problem.Processor sensitivity has finally caught up with the portable 20x optical zoom.

I enjoyed the balance and feel of the camera in my hand.  The zoom made full frame shots a breeze.  The video feature is easy to use, and the image is of very good quality.  I took two 8 gig cards.  In four days, I almost filled one.  I bought a brick of batteries, but changed batteries once.  The image stabilization works very well.  On the long zooms I used a monopod for additional stability.  If you want to shoot five or ten frames per second, spend four times as much.  If you're happy to snap every 1.4 seconds, save your money.  The microphones work well.

In good light focusing was fast and sharp, good improvement over the S5 IS. Image processing was very fast too, thanks to the Digic4 processor.Cons. In low light, the performance is limited, just like any powershot-range camera. Because of densely packed pixels on the sensor, any ISO over 200/400 is unusable. This also limits your zoom at low light, you will need to keep it steady for long exposures.

I'm still learning myself, since I bought my previous camera I was just describing over 7 years ago, so I'm by no means an expert or any authority.  I'm still getting used to this camera.  When I first bought this camera, I never even heard of shutter priority, apertures, white balance, ISO speeds etc.  It all seemed overwhelming really, almost made the camera seem too complicated to use on anything other than Auto.  But I read up on that stuff, and quickly understood it.  Once that happened, putting it all into practice was easy.I finally decided it was time to upgrade, and on paper the SX10 IS looked like it would last me quite a while with all the features it offers.This is a LARGE, heavy, DSL like point and shoot, with all the mode and options you'd find in the lower end DSLR's like the Nikon D40 etc.  I was able to figure out the basic operation just by playing with it, but the manual is helpful.  I STRONGLY urge you to read the manual.I just have to mention the Face Detection.  Playing around with the camera the day I received it, I was pointing it at the TV while watch Law and Order or something like that.  And wouldn't you know it the Face Detection was going nuts.  Every person's face who was on that TV screen, no matter how brief, no matter if it was one face or 3-4 faces, the camera detected their faces and put a white bracket around it.Macro, and Especially Super Macro mode are amazing.  This was one of the things that drew me to this camera.  Being able to put suck a sharp focus on something so close it could be touching the lens is amazing.Like I said previously, before I got this camera I knew nothing about shutter priority, apertures, white balance, ISO speeds and all that.  With that said, after about a week of owning this camera I take almost all my pictures on either Auto, or Full Manual (50/50).  Its just great to be able to fine tune your pictures before you take them.  One of the other things I was worried about when buying a camera is having to rely on software to make the pictures look the way I wanted after transferring them to my PC.  With full manual control, edits like that are almost unnecessary.A word about the \"wheel\".  I guess to some this is a departure from the conventional type of digital camera controls they're used to.  I've never owned a camera like this and with no prior experience I can't really comment on that.  I can comment on the wheel though.  It is a little tough to use, takes anywhere from a 1/4 to 1/2 a turn, probably even more, just to get it to respond.  I suppose that delay in response was probably to prevent setting changes if you accidentally touch the wheel or something.  Either way, it takes some getting used to using.Also, after having this camera for just a week, I have to say I don't know what I'd do with another camera that didn't have the swivel LCD screen.  Its one of those things that you never knew you needed, until you have it and you wonder how other people get by without it.  Definitely handy for macro shots and when using the camera at weird angels.", "Date": "January 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Keeps getting better & better", "Author": "C. Turner", "ReviewID": "R30IQ38GKMYNIT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a (more or less) serious photographer for almost 70 years, and  an earlybird with practically every technological advance in photography since then. In other words, I've seen 'em all.Digital is the great revolution -- nothing in the past comes close to that leap forward. I migrated to it 10 years ago, have owned a dozen or more cameras, and haven't looked back since.Disclaimer: I'm not a professional photographer. What photos I sell might cover my expenses plus a little (13\" x 19\" prints take lots of expensive ink). I don't have to produce near-perfect work day in and day out in a studio or on assignments. Those who have the talent and energy to do this work should have whatever equipment fits their needs. They earn it.I, on the other hand, am among the legions who have the luxury of picking and choosing when, where, and what to photograph. I can make as many errors as I do without damage except to my ego. I can play around with subject, setting, lighting, color, mood, and all those little things that differentiate photography from cellphone snapshots. I don't pay penalties for my goofs.I've had my Canon SX10IS for a only a few weeks, but I can conclude that its value for the money is simply incredible! Whatever nits I can pick (and there are a few) are more in the realm of digging through its scores of features and trying to decide which to use; not in the overall quality, which is simply outstanding.That said, I have to object to what appears to be an ongoing undercurrent of disdain for anything-but-SLRs that keeps coming up in product reviews. Aside from larger CCD sensors, I can't find anything significantly better in most SLRs than in the mid-range non-SLRs such as the SX-10. After decades of lugging several bodies and a half-dozen lenses around in multiple suitcase-sized bags, missing shots because it took so long to screw everything together, while paying many thousands of bucks for the inconvenience, I'm absolutely liberated from the SLR and hope I never have to use one again. The SX10's incredible 20x wide-angle optical zoom eliminates any need I might have for multiple lenses -- I'm not a telephoto zealot. The ease of use eclipses any extra features the SLR might have. The historic SLR advantage of an image seen through the taking lens has been made obsolete by the electronic viewfinder and LCD screen that see through the lens. All that's left for the SLR is lens super-quality and interchangability, more light-gathering ability, and snob appeal. Most of us won't improve our non-professional results much, if at all, with these technical advantages. (I can use Tiger Woods' $10,000 golf clubs and not take a stroke off my score. But he can take my $750 set and shoot under par right out of the bag.)There are mossbacks out there who cling to the notion that if it ain't film, it ain't photography; and that if it ain't an SLR, it ain't a camera. Nonsense. It ain't the equipment, it's what you do with it.Oh, and by the way -- the best camera is the one you have with you. For me, it's my Canon SD-1100-IS that's always in my pocket; my SX-10-IS is now the one that rides around with me in my car; while my SLRs and bags of lenses languish at home in the closet.These are serious cameras for the rest of us.

My guess is that some marketing person did not want the SX10 to compete with Canon's more expensive SLR's, a marketing strategy that has been tried, unsuccessfully, by other companies in the past.The fix is easy. The SX10 comes with a sunshade that attaches to a fixture built onto the barrel. Lensmate sells a well-made ring which uses that fixture and which holds 58mm screw-in filters. Of course, while it is attached one cannot use the sunshade, but for about $7 one can buy a screw-in sunshade that works just as well and that can be used in conjunction with the filters.", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice, but some drawbacks", "Author": "James Ellis", "ReviewID": "R34F778301H379", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice colors. Great zoom. Quiet & smooth zoom operation. Decent view finder with diopter. Lots of functions. Decent low light performance. Improved video performance. Pictures are sharp and clear up to 400 iso. After that, typical noise visible.  Stereo sound. Uses 4 AA batteries instead of 2 thank goodness. Too many buttons in places where accidentally pushed too often & too easy. Easy to block the auto focus beam with your finger. Autofocus has been inconsistant.  Especially indoors, or in lower lighting situations. I've had blurry pictures where I didn't have before or shouldn't have. I'm no pro but, I do take a lot of pictures. Some were published by the College where I work. I like the camera but, I find the inconsistant autofocus cause for concern. My powershot A710is is more consistant in autofocus. Also experiencing inconsistancies loading pictures onto the computer using Canon software & attaching the camera/computer via the cable supplied. Sometimes pictures load ok, other times, the process stalls. I found that using a card reader works better for me. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software, but no change. All in all it's a nice camera.  For me, focus lock & patience is a must. It just doesn't focus quickly/easily everytime indoors or in lower light situations. (like i'm used to)UPDATE 11/09Had to return this camera to Canon for repairs. I started getting \"lens error restart camera\" message. Canon fixed it and returned it to me promptly as it was under warranty. So far, I am unimpressed.  This camera gets glowing reviews everywhere I look. Guess I just got unlucky. I won't buy another super zoom. I'll go DSLR first. If i'm going to invest, then I just will invest more in the better camera.It's really a shame because when the camera is right, it's awesome. I'm hoping that since Canon got it back on the repair bench, that just maybe they found some problems created at the factory, and now have this camera on the right road. I really like the features. What I also discovered was that the mov files are not compatible with windows vista. I had to buy a third party software to convert the mov files to either avi, mpeg or wmv should I want to make movies. Here's hoping.....UPDATE 12/7/2009Just got back from Walt Disney world. I put this camera through a lot of use with stills & video. As long as light is plentiful, the stills & videos are very clear. The autofocus was very good. It's under poor lighting where the autofocus really stumbled often. I get better results with my A710is in poor lighting. It's just hasn't been a good night camera for me. I tried the 1600 iso, but the noise was just awful. Forget 3200. I don't know why Canon even bothered putting it there. In my stills, I used the \"vivid color\" setting outdoors. I loved it. The colors were vibrant as I like personally. I shot outdoor video in \"vivid\" also. Those too looked better for me. The colors were richer.I still hold my opinion of this camera as 3 stars. For the money I paid for this, I expect better performance from the autofocus. I understand that this is a glorified point & shoot with a boat load of features, and those features are useful.  I'm under the impression that the objective of a point and shoot is simplicity, not constantly fussing with manual settings with almost evey picture taken under lower lighting situations. Any camera can take decent day pictures (providing the user sets the camera to its best settings). The autofocus system on a camera of this price should hold up under tougher lighting conditions better than this. Just my opinion. I still like this camera because of the huge zoom but, I think a huge zoom on a point and shoot is a mistake now. I think (suspect) the huge zoom is the entire cause of all the autofocus issues I have with this camera. Too much glass for the image to pass through. The lens is a good lens for point and shoot but, it's not an SLR lens........If most of your picture taking and or video shooting is done under decent lighting, then this is a great camera for people. Their pictures and videos will please them greatly. The pictures are clear and sharp. The videos are also quite good. The camera with the MOV format zooms cleany while shooting video. You can brighten the video if need be while shooting.

Speer", "ReviewID": "RK4PKP9G937K0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So many things in one relatively small camera, wow!  Let's start with the lense.  Very wide angle, careful to keep your foot out of the picture all the way to 20X zoom.  Stood on the beach shooting an island a mile away and zoomed to people on the island beach not visible with the unaided eye without changing lenses.  You are looking through the lense in this DSLR with diopter control if you wear glasses.  The DIGIC 4 is the computer chip that arranges pixels from the 10meg digital CCD.  Even most triple priced DSLR cameras do not have this next generation digital chip yet.  They have the DIGIC III (3).  Want to change colors in the picture or black and white pictures with or without one color?  It will take some time to learn all the composing powers this SX10IS has to offer because of the DIGIC 4 chip.  Needs 4 AAs instead of two like my other \"pocket\" cameras.  That adds to the size and weight putting the SX10IS into a heavier catagory BUT way lighter than most DSLRs.  Easy to hold with one hand.  Four batteries means the right handed grip protrudes more with a nice little lip for your second finger to fit into to leaving your first finger on the picture button.  Several hundred pictures down the road with many armchair reviews in the 2 1/2\" LCD that pulls out and swivels no battery change yet.  AAs are cheap and available everywhere.  Won't even bother with rechargeables because one set lasts so long the rechargeables will run down waiting to be used. Two and half inch LCD and not highly detailed but adequate.  Zooming in while reviewing taken pictures nice.  I suspect that DIGIC 4 is helping too.  SX10IS is not a pocket camera in size or weight.  Last trip to Mexico took the 590IS which is pocket size along with this one but never used it. 20X and wide angle and other features were so nice to have.  Generally I do not try to carry a camera ALL the time.  Like to carry with one hand and wrist strap.  Never around my neck.  Smallest quality bag that fits is the LowePro Apex 100AW roughly 3 1/2 x 4 1/2 by 6\".  That is pretty darn small. Plenty of room for batteries.  Too small for instruction book.  Tossed the neck strap and cut the water proof bag off to gain storage.  I carry bag with built in handle.  Usually just carry the camera without the bag.  Think I bought this from Amazon.  Might also fit in shoulder bag where you carry other things.  Settings for special picture conditions like night, or action, or many many others extensive. \"Auto\" seems to come pretty close to compensating for most pictures.  And you have all the manual choices too.  If you shoot a lot of pictures in specific lighting conditions you can set ISO, shutter speed, etc then record that group of settings along with multiple others as custom choices easily selected again later.  DIGIC 4 again?  Easy camera for no-brainer shots.  If you are a technocrat that likes many composing elements here is a camera that offers choices you never imagined.  Movies with sound and zoom, yes!  Panorama 180 or 360 degrees...........or just pick it up and shoot.  I would suggest this camera is an excellent choice that fits above point and shoot and below much bigger much more expensive, change the lense, type cameras.  Moms that just want a simple, small, light camera, might find SX10IS more than they wanted...........unless you want a close-up at the other end of the soccer field when your little hero kicks a field goal.  It is just not an easy walk around, carry it all the time, type of camera.  It is a super-power camera of picture choices that will look spectacular in you large digital picture frames.  P.S.  Just noticed Consumer Report gave this camera a \"78\" rating.  Among all the other digital camera categories only one had a 78, Nikon D300 which is in the \"advanced\" section and costs $1600 before you buy lenses.  No other camera of any type rated as high.  Type of personal usage still determines which is best.

However, this is a must: READ THE MANUAL AND LEARN THE FEATURES IF YOU WANT TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THIS CAMERA! Here are some pros & cons :Pros:1. Clear pictures at full zoom as well as super macro mode even when the camera lens is so close it touches the object.2. Many features to adjust for different light conditions (learn the features and make adjustments)3. Takes good pictures in low light or almost no light conditions even without the flash (again, learn the features & make adjustments for it) but at very low light conditions I recommend putting the camera on a tripod or have very steady hands.4. Records clear movies with stereo sound & zoom. .mov format can be played with QuickTime Player on Windows XP with no problems.5. Flash power can be adjusted to how far you want it to reach so the background doesn't get washed out.6. Swivel LCD for multi angle viewing.7. The colors come out beautiful.8. Wide angle lens. You can fit more in your pictures.9. Batteries last a long time. I use rechargable Eneloop AA batteries.Cons:1. It's a heavy camera with the 4 batteries in it, even when it's hanging around my neck.2. It's a rather bulky camera for a woman. Women have smaller hands and sometimes it's hard to get a good grip on it.3. The lens cap. There is no string attachment for it! It has a piece of plastic on the back of the cap to attach it to the camera strap but it doesn't work. It doesn't clip on strong enough so the cap falls off anyway.4. The Fireworks feature is useless especially when there is another lit object around the fireworks (expl: Magic Kingdom castle with fireworks around it). The camera asks me to make adjustments (which it shouldn't since it's a set feature), but no matter how I tried to adjust it, it didn't work. Instead, I used the Sports feature and that worked just fine. All other features work well.So overall I give it 5 stars for the money spent but I can't stress enough that this camera will only do the tricks if the adjustments are made for it. It also takes great point-and-shoot pictures but if that's what you are planning on using it for most of the time, I recommend buying a less expensive camera. This is my 4th Canon camera and I find them to be excellent and very durable.", "Date": "February 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "First Impressions- Canon s10is: First Update", "Author": "Nick Vanmatre \"nickv\"", "ReviewID": "R3SZ3TCJ2OFI28", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the Canon s10 for less than 24 hours, so these are my first impressions. I will update later. Assuming you have read other reviews, let me add some different information. Specific points.1. Comments about the lens cap are absolutely true; it is awkward and does not fit easily.  You wind up dropping it frequently and sticking your fingers on the lens. This is not good.2. After inserting the 4 AA batteries, it is very hard getting the cover correctly shut.  I am guessing that it will break easily, if that task is not done very carefully.3. The feel of the camera is great; it fits my older arthritic bulky hands very well.4. I didn't know until I read part of the instruction manual, that the camera has a control that allows you to vary the loudness of separate functions of the camera; shutter, turning on, menu opening, etc...  PLUS, there is a button on the top left of the camera that enables you to MUTE ALL sounds of the camera if you press it as you are turning the camera on.  I think this sound adjustment feature is very handy, although my poor ears have difficulty hearing anything...5. The pictures I have taken have been very good and sharp for me.  I was coming from an older Panasonic point and shoot.6. I am really, really having to read the manual to learn all the different capabilities.  If you get this camera, plan on spending some real time with the manual.  For example, it is not intuitively obvious how one changes the size of the desired image from 10 to 1 megapixel.  It took real manual reading to figure that out.7. Despite my nit-picks, I am loving this camera. It is absolutely doing what I wanted.  Namely giving me some really good manual and varied functions in a premium point and shoot without the expense of a DSLR.My plan, if I continue to use this and enjoy photography, then I will upgrade to a DSLR, but right now, I have lots to learn, and enjoy with the Canon S10.NickUPDATE: 16 Dec 2008Still love the camera, but still learning.  You MUST read the User Manual, and study it, in combination with playing with the camera.  Good way to spend a couple of hours at Star$$s.  The manual tells you specifically how to make certain changes in settings; however, it does NOT tell you when or why to make the changes.  You need to study it and THINK.  If you want a camera just to take simple, quick snapshots, this camera will do it, but that would be wasting this cameras terrific abilities. Spend a lot less and get a regular Canon or Sony P&S.;If you want a camera to learn how to do manual settings, like aperture and shutter priority settings, and others, WITHOUT spending the big $$$s needed to buy a DSLR, then this is the perfect camera for that.Specific points:1. The built in flash is not very strong at all.  I will need to get a Canon external flash, probably the 430ex model, to make it as strong as I would like.2. Figuring out how to change the image size, from 10 M to 8 or even down to less than 1 M for a 640x480 pixel photo is NOT intuitively obvious.  You have to read the manual and learn that it is necessary to push the Function button while the camera is in take photo mode and then look down the list of items and choose from: 10M, 8M, etc...3. The lens for this camera isn't the world's greatest.  When it is dark it will only open up to 4.0 and that just isn't fast enough; then with a low power flash, your low light shooting is compromised yielding \"noisy\"/unsharp  images.4. I haven't found a camera bag that suits my taste for this camera yet; still looking.  I want something that will carry the camera, an external flash, a spare set of batteries, and little nit-bits.  I am sure they exist, just haven't found the right one.  But then, searching for photography stuff is always fun...  I AM loving the camera, but would still leave the rating at four stars.", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Overall, so far, GREAT!", "Author": "S.

Bak", "ReviewID": "RE31EW8PVUVWP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Greetings-- since the release of this camera I have been following all the user reviews on Amazon and the consensus seemed to be overwhelmingly positive. Based on the user reviews and other research that I did, I pulled the trigger and bought one. I was really excited about getting this camera because it sounded like the next step up over what I currently have.When I received the camera I began running it through it's paces. Very soon into it I began to see issues with the camera.  Moving beyond those though, I started taking test pictures using all of the different settings available.  I then loaded the images to my PC and began looking at them. What I viewed was very disappointing. First off, the images were not sharp. Secondly, the colors seemed muted and they were not very accurate to what the actual scene looked like. Lastly and on closer examination, I was stunned to see large amounts of purple fringing. This is a problem I would expect on earlier generations of digital cameras, but not now and not on a Canon. What is really sad is that purple fringing is most common in high contrast areas; with my test pictures high contrast scenes were not the case. The purple fringing explained the lack of punch, sharpness, and color accuracy. Thinking I may have received a defective camera I did some Googling. To my surprise I found other people were reporting the same problem with this camera.I have to tell ya, prior to this Canon purchase I had used a Kodak Z650.  The images I get from the Kodak blow away anything I got out of the Canon. Needless to say, the Canon was returned for refund. (I want to thank Amazon for the quick and painless processing of the return.)Here are some other issues I found with this camera:1. The selector wheel that is used to navigate within the menus did not translate properly. I found myself spinning it around several times before it would begin moving the cursor. Along with that there was a stickiness to it. It would stick and you'd have to apply more pressure for it to turn, this in turn caused the cursor to jump father than you wanted to go. It was frustrating to use. You can get around all that by pressing the dial down in the corners for the direction you want to go. That seemed to translate well but it is more time consuming. One click equals one position in the menu. If you want to reach the end of the menu you'd have to click your way through one position at a time.2. I feel the menu layout and functionality was poorly designed and not very intuitive. There are too many layers to navigate through and too many ways to get where you want to go. Here again, my Kodak does a much better job in accessing the options and settings. And just to be clear, the Kodak has many of the same SLR functions to choose from. My point being, it's pretty much an apples and apples comparison.  The Kodak is extremely easy to navigate and very easy to learn. Canon could take some lessons from them.  I'm not trying to sell Kodak here. The Kodak has it's own issues.  The one main thing going for the Kodak is that it is capable of producing some stunning images, and that is the very least I'd expect from a camera.3. The camera is pretty heavy as others have reported.  It's not a problem for me but I think it is worth mentioning again.4. I found that the lens cap falling off was not a problem for me, but taking it off was.  I found this primarily true when you are using the lens shield that Canon supplies.  It was difficult for me to fit my fingers between the inner lens shield wall and the lens cap where the releases are located.  It was very clumsy and difficult to squeeze the tabs in order to release the cap.I would have overlooked notes 1 to 4 if the image quality had been there. Sadly for me it wasn't.", "Date": "March 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Small complains", "Author": "John Leong \"C'est moi\"", "ReviewID": "R96TXEW7ZBIYL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as an upgrade to my trusty old Canon S2.  Based on 3 days experience, the photographic aspect of the camera is great - better than the S2 particularly the 28mm wide angle.  However, I have a few little complains on the ergonomic side.(1) The cammera is significantly larger and heavier than the S2.  And it is bit of a pain since I cannot reuse my old S2 camera case.(2) The SX10 comes with a clip-on lens cap which is pretty finicky to put on in comparison to the S2 plastic lens cap which I can easily and quickly slap on to the lens housing.  Furthermore, while the S2 cap comes with a string to be attached to the camera body.  That is not the case with the SX10.  So I can see losing my lens cap pretty soon.(3) The inside grip on the S2 is kind of sanded so it can be gripped firmly.  The grip on the SX10 is smooth and a bit slippery. It does not offer me as firm and confident a grip as the S2, particularly when the camera is heavier.  May be it will become less slippery with time.Other than the above, good camera.", "Date": "October 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sticking with the S5... the SX10 Deal Killer", "Author": "wanderlust", "ReviewID": "R128LEE2WLK5SQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Greetings everyone!I waited so long to buy my canon s5 just waiting for the sx10...just in case I wanted to get the most recent model. So I wanted to love the sx10. I mean what would there be not to love with a 20x zoom.Well alot and I am really disheartened after testing it out and I will be sending it back to amazon as soon as I receive one of the last s5's sold by costco. I bought mine last night and today they had taken them down from their site. So I got lucky.So I was willing to compromise on alot to keep the sx10 because I really do appreciate huge zooms especially one with a nice wide angle.I was willing to live with the mov format over the avi because when I viewed it from my laptop the quality is not too much different than the avi though a little more complex to process for some people.I was willing to live with the bulkier lens yet for incognito purposes like concerts the s5 without lens adapter can pass for a point in shoot while the sx10 really looks like a dslr almost the size of my Nikon d40.Now since I have a dslr you might ask why I wanted the s5 when clearly the images can't come close to the d40. Well, I really love the articulating screen for when I'm doing blogging or making some kind of how to video for youtube where I can watch what I'm filming while I'm basically filming myself.I mostly want to keep the s5 for the video capabilities because it's very good in low light even in an aquarium setting. Which brings me to the deal killer of the sx10 it is just terrible in low to medium lighting when using the zoom.I was outside in fairly good light filming my airedale playing soccer and the lcd grew dark when I zoomed in. At first I thought, oh defective camera until I realized it was just the change in fstop.If canon had been able to keep the same f stop range as the s5, I would have tolerated everything else for the nice wide angle and telephoto zoom which I do love and for the ability to use a higher iso with less noise. But high iso cannot compensate for it's poor performance in anything but strong sun lighting. But with the change in control dial which is tedious and the inability to add filters and the terrible low light performance...I'm forced to pass on this upgrade.I did discover in my testing if you put a 55mm polarizing filter over the lens it will stay put and if you carefully twist the polarizing ring you can can take pictures with it but you have to be very mindful and this would probably prove tedious in a real world photo session. And I for one really love using a polarizer.So those are my frustrations and I am disillusioned after having such high hopes for this camera.So what I'm left grateful of is that I have the s5 to fall back on for when I want to use an articulating screen for picture taking and a really high quality, low light ability of the video.Warmly,Laurie", "Date": "October 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "You can take

or in my purse so it's always handy.  I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on a camera and have to spend hundreds on extra lenses.  My Casio camera serves me just fine in many circumstances.  I take a lot of people pictures and pictures at parties and get-togethers.  But there were always those times when I was in a beautiful location and wanted something that would do a good job with pictures of mountains, lakes and other landscape features.  Or I wanted to take a photo of our Christmas tree at night with the lights in a dark room and I just could never really capture the shot.  I often wanted to take pictures of the squirrels or a woodpecker on the tree but with a 3x optical zoom you just can't get \"up close and personal\".  This camera will do all that and more.  It will also do automatic, point and shoot photos, just like my little point and shoot camera.I hate to read manuals and instructions.  But with this camera it's something you just have to set aside some time and pretty much read through the well organized little manual that comes with it.  It's easy enough reading and well organized with references to page numbers describing each feature and cross referenced well.  Perhaps someone with experience on other SLR cameras or more complicated cameras would find this camera intuitive, but I had to sit down a study a bit before really getting into all the features.  Once I had the camera set up and tried the different features and settings it was easy enough to do, but there is a little learning curve.  The good news is there are many more things I can do with this camera than I ever imagined.With other cameras I've owned I could take macro photos of things like flowers or food.  With this camera I can take a super macro of not only the flower, but the bee on the flower and the hair on his legs!  With other cameras low light photos were just so-so.  With this camera you can take photos in very low light which I find myself using more and more, now that I have a camera that will handle it.  The 20x zoom is nothing short of amazing.  This is great for taking photos of outdoor critters or spying on your neighbor's gardener.  It's almost like having a pair of binoculars and being able to capture it on digital film.  You can take great movies with stereo sound.  It's so much easier than getting out the video camera every time you want to take a short movie of the dog doing something cute or your neighbor's kid doing something stupid.  There are some special scene settings that are a quick way of setting up the camera for different types of photos.  I've had very good results using these and look at all the different circumstances they cover:  You have settings for portraits, landscape, night scenes or snapshots, sports, indoor, sunsets, foliage, snow, beach, fireworks (can't wait to try this one out), aquarium, ISO 3200, color accent and color swap.The flip-out and rotating 2.5-inch LCD screen is a feature I love and I haven't seen it on any other camera in this class.  It makes it simple to see what you're taking from any angle and is nice because you can tilt it out of the sun.  I find all the buttons, built in flash and controls easy to use and I can re-set it quickly for different types of circumstances.  I really like the stitch assist for taking panorama shots that I can later stitch together on my computer into one wide panoramic image.  There are so many more settings and things that you can do, just too many to list here.The camera will definitely not fit in the pocket of my jeans but the weight and size aren't bad.  I bought the Carrying Case / Shoulder Bag for the Canon EOS Digital Rebel XSi, PowerShot S5 IS, Powershot SX1 IS, SX10 IS case which is perfect for this camera.  I'm posting a short video showing the case and just a few features of the camera.  It's too bad I couldn't use this camera to take the video.  The close-ups would have been a lot clearer than what I could do with my video camera.  I thought of including some photos taken with the camera on the video, but with the compression needed to fit the videos on this website the wouldn't do them justice.  Even the photos posted by other reviewers on this site, as amazing as they are, look even better when you see them on your own computer or printed.I did a lot of research on cameras and then I hesitated for a long time, wondering if I would use it enough to justify the cost.  I shouldn't have waited.

I really like the ability to switch between aperture (Av) and shutter speed (Tv) priority. And I find it's much easier to use the viewfinder than the LCD screen (so it was important to me for my digital camera to have a viewfinder). And until I looked at the differences (in the manual's appendix) between Auto and Programmed modes, I wondered why have both ... now I'm glad I looked.One of the first things I did was to turn off most of the camera's \"helpful\" settings. I am a big fan of fixing things like contrast or red eye AFTER downloading the photos to my computer ... not having the camera pretending to know what I want better than I do. And I usually only want to target a portion of the image ... not the entire image that these helpful settings attempt to fix.Others have complained that the lens cap is easy to lose ... but I got so used to putting my Canon A1's lens cap in my pocket as soon as I took it off (it didn't have a lens strap either) that I just kept following that practice with my new SX10IS.One of the things I like the most is the fact that it uses standard AA batteries. My previous digital camera (a Nikon - because the lens is what matters when taking a photo) used a proprietary battery that was difficult to find at times (even the store where I usually bought the battery was occasionally out of stock).The popup flash allows me to place a loose fabric over the flash to reduce the flash brightness (something next to impossible on the Nikon with its flash built into the housing). I haven't yet upgraded to the Canon Speedlight flash ... but it's nice to know that I have that option.For me, the biggest drawback is that the shutter release button is placed a bit too far forward for my tastes ... but that's a small problem. Not everyone has the same requirements for a digital camera as I do ... but I'd say this is one of the best (unless you opt for the hugely expensive DSLRs). Read all of the reviews and see if what people say matches your requirements ... but I can say that I'd recommend this camera for anyone who is even a little serious about their photography.You can do a lot with this camera before you run into an option you wish the camera had.", "Date": "February 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Almost professional grade", "Author": "Matthew Summers \"wizard of many colors\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZPVFS2JXDSH1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Firstly, I'm not a professional photographer by any means. However I do know several people who are, and having run it through their tests and mine, can say that this camera is great for the price point. I say almost professional because you won't be getting photos in National Geographic with it (unless you're really good). For a wedding photographer, \"lesser journalist\", or professional \"Ebay-er\" it meets and exceeds what one requires. It's also just fun to play with. Alright let's talk features. The 20X optical zoom does not disappoint, with sharp focus corner to corner. Add in an additional 60x digital zoom for a whopping 80x that allows for stunning close-ups with suprisingly low distortion/color noise. With the very aggressive tremor reduction it's possible to get clear pictures of the moon without a tripod! The ability to lock the focus by holding the shutter button halfway is another standout feature for un-cooperative subjects. Additionally the burst shooting mode works well, with low lag. It can get some immpressive action shots when combined with the 3200 ISO high shutter speed mode. Let's not forget the plethora of packed in modes and tools. Photos can be resized, cropped, and colors tweaked directly from the camera without navigating 15 menus. The latter color editing is merely choosing from optimized presets, but works well enough for a pack in. Shooting modes range from fireworks to aquarium, are readily accessed by spinning a dial and are genuinely useful. Some of the more artistic and interesting ones are the color swap/color accent which swaps a color you pick from whatever's in the viewfinder, and the more striking color accent which renders the whole image slightly greyscale except for a user selected color. It looks really cool when used to highlight trees/plants/flowers. Speaking of the viewfinder, it sports a mini LCD with crisp image and bright backlight. The main LCD is equally clear, if sometimes too bright to accurately judge whether you got the colors/lighting you wanted. My advice, use the big LCD to show off your pics or as a reference. When in doubt check the viewfinder and trust it over the exterior screen (lower res. but better contrast, besides real photographers use the viewfinder!). The external LCD has a neat feature of rotating the image as you rotate the camera to keep it upright. If you take a pic sideways the camera will automatically straighten it out while preserving the taller aspect ratio, a nice time saver. I could keep going for pages but these are just a few of the things that really sold me on it. To cover a few gripes for good measure, the manual is HUGE and some kind of awful confusing. Best bet is to skim it to find out what buttons do what and then put it away and experiment(You were gonna do that anyway right?). The included software is clunky and boring, but you probably knew that. The flash works well enough, but to Canon's credit it features a hotshoe for remote flash which I recommend. The battery life is not terribly immpressive either, typically a fresh set seems to last 4-6 hours. Closer to 6 if you judiciously hide the big LCD. If you like to show off your work, get a battery pack and recharger and prepare to use it ALOT (That goes double if you use the flash often). All taken into account this camera is literally THE BEST you will find without taking the plunge into $700+ professional territory.

I knew what features I wanted, but up until recently I couldn't find a camera fitting all my needs. I decided that for my purposes of taking travel pictures I wanted something easy to use, but an upgrade to my present camera, a Canon PowerShot A610. I really liked the shape of the camera, which is easy to hold with one hand. Then one of the best features was vari-angle LCD. After searching different cameras I was thrilled when I found the SX10IS which had most if not all the features I had been looking for. I wanted at least 18x optical zoom and this has 20x; I definitely wanted the vari-angle LCD for taking pictures either higher or lower than a comfortable viewing level. (It sure saves on backs when wanting to take a close up of a flower and you can turn the viewer up and hold the camera down at arms length to get a great picture). It also has the easy grip like my older camera, however I find there are more buttons that I sometimes push inadvertantly, and get out of the mode that I want to be in. As I get more used to the camera I don't mess up as often. The pictures come out crystal clear and I can zoom in when viewing on my computer and still get great pixel clarity. The finished photos I have had processed have come out close to studio quality. Recently I took portraits of guests at our Christmas party and had rave reviews of the finished product with many ordering additional prints to send to family and friends. Also, I was extremely pleased when taking photos at the Tournament of Roses parade last week.Most electonic gadgets have more features on them then one will ever use, and this camera is no exception. Slowly, I am trying to learn more to take advantage of more features. On the other hand, if you want ease of use then with this camera you can be out taking pictures as soon as you put in your batteries and memory card. Speaking of memory cards, you will want to buy a high speed card to take advantage of the continuous shoot feature. This is great when taking pictures of moving objects. Another feature I haven't mentioned is the great video (with sound) that you can take with this camera. Having a high capacity memory SD card helps. I always carry extra cards, but with my new 8 GB card I won't be using the extra cards very often.Face recognition is another feature I haven't used before.  It is an interesting feature and new tool when taking group shots.I could go on and on, there are so many good things I could say about this camera.  I really don't have any negatives other than accidentally pushing buttons when I don't want to.  As I had read in another review, the controls are \"touchy\" and you have to be aware of where your \"fat fingers\" land.I'm a senior citizen who loves to take pictures and have thousands of photos on my computer. I enjoy viewing slide shows of all the pictures of our travels throughout the USA and also abroad. If you want to take a step up from the compact point and shoot then I would highly recommend the Canon PowerShot SX10IS.

The focus is good and fast.  The colors are OUTSTANDING and the 20x zoom and 28mm wide angle are features that offer the best of both worlds when it comes to handling a variety of situations.On top of that, the Image Stabilization works very well and makes the 20x zoom usable.Plus, my dad has now retired his old video camera as well since you can get image stabilized, 20x zoomable, 640x480 stereo video at the press of a button.

Dean", "ReviewID": "RC7DSPYM1D4A9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is one of the most feature packed little cameras I've used. The first hint is the nearly 300 page manual. It really requires reading at least twice, with camera in hand, to get a grasp on which functions are ones you will use and which ones are of lesser interest for your style of shooting. From focus bracketing to overlap assisted panoramic mode to in camera image editing, the SX10 IS will amaze you with its capabilities. If you aren't interested in spending some real time to learn what this camera can do for you, buy a simpler camera with a fully automated mode and save your money. This camera is geared toward the person that uses a camera frequently and can remember how to access its many helpful features. Of course, it has a fully auto mode if you want to hand it to a person to snap away for you, without having to know what every button does.Next comes the most important reason for buying any camera - image quality. Again, this camera can hold its own. This is a very small sensor camera. There is not a camera on the market with this size sensor that is going to produce high ISO, low light images that amaze you with beautiful, highly enlarged images. You've got to step way up in size and money for that kind of shooting. Otherwise, the SX10 IS will really surprise you. I'm astounded by the great images I can get up to ISO 400. Even ISO 800 shots are more than acceptable in decent lighting situations.Combined with a Canon 580EX II, you can get some fantastic flash photography. Admittedly, this is a huge flash for such a small camera, but I already had one so I use it. You don't give up the best features of the flash with this camera. Many cheaper cameras won't use many of the features of the high end flashes. Not so with this combination. Things like high speed sync that allow very short shutter speeds are supported.And of course, there is the main reason most people will even consider a camera in this league, the ultra long focal range. Combined with the easy portability of this camera, the lens makes this a great camera for doing it all. You can really stretch out there with a 35mm equivalency of 560mm focal length. The camera's IS feature allows you to hand hold the camera and still get good shots at this focal length in good lighting. The 28mm short end of the lens is quite good too.As you can probably tell, after several weeks of using the SX10 IS, I am excited over this camera. To say it has replaced my Canon DSLR for casual shooting is an understatement. It has become my preferred camera in situations I never dreamed it would be used. If I don't need extremely short depth of field or very high ISO, super low noise images, this is the camera I pick up.

My older camera is a Canon A80 which I like. Naturally I found this Canon SX10IS to be a little confusing and intimidating. However, I found the cure for this was, and is, practice and study.I first tried pictures of the moon which were disappointing. The focus was not good (just a fuzzy yellow ball) and the digital zoom was set \"on\" from the factory. This meant that the zoom was 80X. Even with a tripod it was difficult to keep the moon in the camera sight. I set the digital zoom to \"off\" and I recommend that it never be set to \"on\". If you want a closer image  you can crop the picture later. This is all the digital zoom does but which a lot more fuss. I then set the focus to spot and got a great picture of the moon.The 20X zoom is especially nice. I live at the ocean and can photograph fishing vessels just off the coast or seagulls sitting on a post in the harbor. Distant mountains are drawn up and the foreground foreshortened. This can produce very wonderful pictures that you cannot get with a lesser zoom. A tripod helps to keep the camera steady on many occasions.I tried the \"SCN\" setting (on sunset) for the first time and got dramatic results. I tried the same picture with the normal setting and it was just okay. With the SCN setting some people said that I should sell the picture commercially.Pictures in the camera can be viewed without turning the camera on as it to photograph. This may seem like a small thing but I found it to be useful and battery saving.The camera uses 4 AA size batteries. I believe that prior versions of this camera used the speciality lithium battery which is a major reason I didn't buy it before. I have known too many people whose photography during a vacation was cut short by a depleted battery. AA batteries can be purchased anywhere in the world and in my limited experience so far battery life appears excellent.I am enjoying the camera. It is just darn fun to use and try new things.

AA batteries are preferable to proprietary lithium ions because of their widespread availability and low cost.  Having 4 AA's instead of 2 is a good tradeoff that provides longer battery life at the expense of size and weight.  The vari-angle LCD lets me take photos from all angles.  I prefer point and shoot to DSLR because the cameras are less expensive and more convenient to carry and use.  Like its predecessors in Canon's S-series, the SX10 lets you record audio for each shot which is a great convenience for documenting landmarks during my journeys. 10 megapixel resolution is more than adequate for the online pictures I mainly use and even for my occasional enlargements of 16x20.  The controls are very convenient to access.  The video quality is excellent.  It seems like Canon thought of everything.I haven't decided yet whether to buy a Canon flash for maximum compatibility or a different brand for less cost at the expense of reduced compatibility.  Since I use flash infrequently, I can wait to make that decision.  In a little more than a week I've taken 500+ photos to experiment with the camera.  I'm very satisfied that the SX10 provides the improvements I sought.", "Date": "December 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot SX10IS", "Author": "PatsyAnn", "ReviewID": "R17IDREVESSBFD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lot's of features for the money.

I'm mainly leaving this review for people with kids who are wondering if this camera can keep up with taking quick fast shots, without missing out on precious moments.Fast Camera!!!This camera has NEVER missed a shot and she's a very quick and fast little two year old. I've captured every single quick smile, precious pose, and all of her active moments. I do this using the sports mode. In this mode, the camera actually takes the picture the very same instant you press down on the button (no delay whatsoever). In this mode, when she's running, there is no blurryness.Great Indoor Camera!!!This camera also takes GREAT indoor pics as well. It is a bit heavier than the little camera's out there....but if you want to sacrifice qaulity and performance...go for a little one.Outstanding Detail and Zoom qaulityI wanted something that was powerful, and something that my husband can take to football games, basketball and other sporting events. That's actually how I sold him on the idea of purchasing this camera. The zoom capability is out of this world. For example, we went to the park the other day and I was able to get pictures of the ducks from the OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE....and in very clear detail. Now that's powerful.Easy to use!!!The minute this camera arrived, I took it out of the box and started using it. I didn't even read the instructions...that's how easy it is to use. I'm more of a beginner type when it comes to camera's. I popped the batteries in, and went crazy taking pics. The video mode has a dedicated button so you can video events very quickly without fussing with dials.No Regrets!!!I hope I've helped someone out on making their purchase decision.

But when I brought it home, it frustrated me that I couldn't zoom in and focus on someone's eye while 5 feet away.  (the P80 couldn't either)  I also didn't think it did great in poor lighting without the flash.  The files were a bit grainy, and sometimes it didn't focus.So I returned it and got the Nikon P80.  I fell in love with it because of the ease of use, the manual was so easy to understand, everything seemed wonderful.  But when I compared the pictures side by side with the Canon pictures, Canon came out ahead.  I took pictures with both cameras of the same things, at the same times and settings.  The Canon images were more true to color, they were clearer, and flash didn't dominate or change the lighting.  It performed better in almost everything, and it's a much more solid feeling camera.THE VIDEO AND SOUND QUALITY WERE MILES APART!!  The Nikon video was very grainy and not too focused.  When I played it back on my computer, the mono sound was so hollow.  But the Canon video was so clear I could see my reflection in my daughter's eye!  And the sound is truly in stereo!  There is NO comparison.  You can even take still pics while doing a video with the Canon, but not with the Nikon.Nikon is definitely better at taking sharp, clear images in poor lighting.  But in the zoom, Canon is slightly ahead.I don't really like the design of the Canon, specifically the location of the three buttons where my thumb likes to hold the camera.  One of them is the DELETE button!  I keep accidently pressing those buttons!  They should not be there.  There should be a rubber grip like on the Nikon, and nothing else.Also, I like the lens cap better on the Nikon than on the Canon, but for the quality of the pics and especially the video and stereo sound, who cares about the cap!Well, I went back to the store and asked for my Canon.  They still had it in the same place when I had returned it the day before.  I'm loving it now.  I will learn to grip my camera wider so that I don't hit the buttons, and I will zoom out just a bit to get that perfect shot.There is yet another thing.  When I looked at the \"details\" for the files, the Nikon ones recorded at 300 dpi, and the Canon ones were only at 180 dpi.  So I don't know what's going on there.  They were both set at the highest, largest, superfine settings.  Oh well.  I still think the Canon SX10 performs better than the Nikon P80.", "Date": "January 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bryan Odie", "Author": "Bryan O.", "ReviewID": "R2U6734XLHL6ZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for Christmas last year, so I have a year of experiences and thoughts to share... nonetheless, I'll try to make it worth your time!First off, I recently read another post that said \"All choices of cameras and lenses are compromises, involving size, ease of use, cost, weight, lens quality, and more,\" and I need to say I couldn't agree more. If you're looking for DSLR quality images (due to the larger sensor size) or super-fast burst rate for shooting sports, or even great low-light performance, this camera will provide you with basic functionality but leave you always looking up-market (and wishing you had the cash to satisfy your desire!). Alternatively, if you're looking for a great little camera that takes terrific shots and which you will always have with you because it's easy to carry around and fits in your back pocket, this camera will have you gazing admiringly at the never-ending onslaught of point-and-shoot ads coming your way. So, you need to recognize that whichever camera you buy, you're making a compromise, because camera manufacturers have not yet figured out how to make a DSLR-quality camera that slips easily into your pocket or purse.Why choose the SX10IS then? I'd say start with this premise: great photos are more a function of the photographer (and his/her use of composition, use of light, and editing software!) than the technology at his disposal. I've taken some great - really interesting - shots with my iPhone because the opportunities presented themselves and that was the only camera I had available. But having taken those shots and been encouraged by them, I wanted to explore what I might be able to do with a more powerful camera at my disposal. The SX10IS has been that camera.As a novice, the most amazing features of the camera will be the 20X zoom and the image stabilization. I've taken photos of my wife and son at least 100 yards away at the top of a sled run, on full zoom, where their faces came out clear as a bell. I'm told this used to be absolutely unheard of without a tripod. Similarly, I've taken some beautiful panoramic pacific ocean sunsets and then zoomed in from a mile away on a fishing boat where I can see the fisherman working on pulling up his net in profile - all while sitting in the exact same spot! Absolutley amazing stuff... never discount the power of image stabilization for improving your pictures, especially if you've suffered from blurred photos in the past, as I have.Some other thoughts: this camera has just about all of the manual settings you'll get on a DSLR, so if you want the opportunity to grow and learn, this will allow you to do so, at a fraction of the cost. Also, the pre-set \"scene\" modes should not be overlooked. I was trying to take pictures of my son's soccer games on Auto mode and not real happy with them, when I remembered the \"Sports\" mode on the dial. I switched the dial, and suddently I was able to catch the action with the players in mid-stride and the ball frozen mid-air, just like the pros (well, not \"just like\" but pretty good, given I didn't have the super-fast burst mode they do).I will say that the user manual is a pain to follow, which has slowed my progress in learning the manual features.All in all, I have to give this camera two thumbs up: it met my needs for cost (got it for only $325, with free shipping and no sales tax!), while feeding my desire to learn more and improve my photographic skills. Do I still wish I could get Canon 40D-type quality and specs in the body of a Canon S90? The answer is a definitive Yes (the Canon G11 might be the another great compromise, like the SX10), but short of carrying around multiple cameras, the SX10 is definitely a camera that can be recommended.Happy shopping and happy shooting!", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera!!!", "Author": "Regina \"ibi-ubu\"", "ReviewID": "RO2PQ7GL7JMKY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want a camera that takes excellent pictures but really don't want to learn all of the intricacies of photography.

I wanted to replace my old Minolta F200 for better quality images. Honestly, it was not better if not worse. I was actually surprised that my old F200 was as good as this camera concerning image quality.First, there was so much noise in the image. As a natural result, many of my pictures were not clear and I had to painfully discard them. I don't like grain in the picture and it was the main reason for replacing the old F200, but obviously SX10IS didn't satisfy me. Second, on ISO 80 in aperture priority mode (no zoom), I changed aperture from f/2.8 to f/8 and got blurrier image (surely I used tripod), which is counter-intuitive to me, because with f/8 and with its tiny sensor, theoretically, I had to get virtually infinite depth and sharper image. What's wrong?? Am I missing something?? This problem made me feel that this camera might have some fundamental flaws in its optic design. Third, focus is very bad. It is very difficult to auto-focus on anything including side view of face in medium or low light. Focus during movie taking is more terrible. It goes back and forth between in-focus and out-focus. Very bad.Of course there are many good points (that's why I decided not to return it). I really like the full manual mode because finally I can apply many basic photography concepts. I also like the external flash mount, which most point-and-shoot cameras don't have. It is a big positive point for those who want to learn lighting. Finally, 20x zoom is a very good addition, because I don't have to purchase expensive and heavy lenses (the biggest reason I stay away from DSLR cameras) and I actually got some good out-of-focus images.Overall, if you want much better image quality in a similar body size (at around $700, without 20x zoom, and potentially additional lens purchases), check out Panasonic G1 (micro 4/3). But if you don't really mind the picture quality so much (in fact, with a tiny little sensor, it is physically very difficult to get sharp images), this is a very good camera. Almost everything you can find in DSLR is in this camera without heavy weight and lenses.

I'm just a guy who (in '09) hurriedly bought this camera at the last minute while preparing for an overseas trip so that I could take some pictures to show people back home. I didn't plan anything fancy. Back then I knew nothing about composition, lighting, exposure, ISO, or anything else. All I knew was how to point the camera, zoom in and out, and shoot. That's it. That said, I switched it on for the first time somewhere over the Atlantic ocean at 35,000 feet and took a couple of pictures inside the aircraft, and a few more while waiting at the airport in London during a layover (on the way to Kenya, then Zanzibar, and finally back home). The trip was around 2 weeks in duration, and the entire time I shot in \"Auto\" mode with absolutely no concept of the technical aspects of photography (just like a typical tourist) and no knowledge of how to use a digital camera beyond the bare essentials of turning it on, pointing and holding down the shutter control button. Being a stranger to digital photography, I found the menus & settings (e.g., \"Tv\", \"Av\", etc.) to be like trying to read a foreign language, so I left all of it alone. (The only exception was that by fiddling around with the menu I stumbled upon a way to use the digital zoom which enabled me to take some great telephoto shots of a leopard in a tree and a pride of lions from a safe distance). Long story short, while headed to a safari camp on the Serengeti the first animals we encountered were zebras, so I stuck the camera out the window of the van and started taking pictures. For the next few days, I took lots of pictures of wildlife, all in \"Auto\" mode, as well as some pictures at the various hotels I was staying at & later on and around the island of Zanzibar. About the only other thing I did with the camera was review my pictures through the LED screen. I thought to myself \"these look good enough, so I'll print them out and show them around when I get back home.\" When I finally printed out the pictures I was blown away by the quality. The \"Auto\" function on the camera actually did the most important work - controlling the exposure by adjusting the aperture and shutter speed according to lighting conditions. On further reflection, I reasoned that if the pictures taken by somebody as clueless as I was look that stunning, what on earth would they look like if they were taken by somebody who actually knew what they were doing, and knew how to squeeze the most out of this camera. Probably such a person would require something a lot more sophisticated than the SX10 (i.e., a high end, expensive DSLR camera), but still...Since my overseas trip, I have been teaching myself principles of photography including composition, lighting, exposure control, etc. NOW I can pick up my SX10 and go through the menus and control dial and at least have a theoretical knowledge of what I'm looking at and what each setting does. I have not yet gone out and taken photos where I actually manipulate the controls to achieve certain effects, but I'm getting there.Fast forward to this past 4th of July (2013). While at a picnic, I walked around taking pictures (CANDID shots, they're much more interesting than pictures of people standing still posing for the camera), mostly of the people I was with doing what people do when they picnic - adults sitting & standing around talking, eating, laughing, listening to music, kids running around, etc. AGAIN, I shot entirely in \"Auto\" mode (still not quite ready to use the other controls for mission critical shots), printed out the pictures (using my new Canon MX892 Pixma printer. The previous printer that I used to print the pictures from my trip was a very nice, but older HP Photosmart 2410 that died on me a couple of months ago after many years of great service, but I digress.) AGAIN, looking at the prints, I had another *OMG!!* moment. The quality of the images was simply jaw dropping, so much so that the people I was picnicking with think I'm some kind of photography genius, but I will humbly say once again that it was the camera in \"Auto\" mode that's responsible for the quality of the images, not me.In conclusion, if you want to take really nice pictures with a limited knowledge of digital photography, it's hard to go wrong with this camera. If you want to enhance your knowledge of photography as you go along, the only other thing I would recommend is that you check out youtube; there are many hours of recently posted instructional videos covering all aspects of photography - portrait, landscape, wildlife, etc., composition, exposure, lighting, etc., as well as numerous tutorials on how to use your photographic equipment, software (such as Photoshop), etc.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot SX10IS", "Author": "Lynn R.

The main reason is that most of the \"experts\" out there who tested both cameras claim that the SX10 has slightly better image quality, and that was important to me. I know that the SX10 has a \"Super Fine\" image quality setting, while the newer SX20 can only go as high as a \"Fine\" setting.

After a friend bought the Canon Powershot SX1 and was raving, as well as showing some fantastic prints she had created, I did my own research and determined the few features that were different between the SX1 and the SX10 were minute and not anything I would need for almost $200.00 difference in price.  Also some of the reviews had the SX10 having less noise or graininess in the zoom shots.  So, after much debate, I bought the SX10.I am so pleased with my decision.  So far, I have only just \"played\" around with it, but I have taken shots in low-light, bright light and distance and each one has all the quality I could ask for.After going on vacation in July, and forgetting my Sony's battery charger (and spending quite a bit of time locating a replacement charger - finally found at a Radio Shack), it is nice having a camera that takes AA batteries.

My canon powershot A75 was great for my now 4 yr old but it took 3 or so seconds to take the picture & I was missing that 1 second smile my infant would give before she looked away.  I read reviews on this camera plus many other cameras & decided to go with this one, instead of the Nikon.  The single most important thing to me was getting the best quality picture!  I'm not concerned with how it works with the computer or the video aspect of it, so if you are buying it for that, my review won't be that helpful.Pros:  This camera definitely has crisper pictures with a softer look & snaps photos quickly, one right after another which is great.  I haven't had to change the batteries yet & have used the camera a lot.  The lighting is spectacular, even indoors & it wasn't even on the indoor setting.  The manual was easy to read & provides much information on how to get the best shot in all situations.  (Personally, I can't remember it all & only focus on how to get the best still shot, action shot & indoor shot).Cons:  The on/off button.  I keep hitting that instead on taking the picture.  Canon should have put it in a different place.  The flash; it isn't automatic but it tells you to put it up when necessary (by then your one & only shot may be gone).  When using the zoom at its max, the pictures are blurry unless your hand is perfectly steady (not mine! & I try really hard).  I would suggest a tripod. It is a little bulky & bigger than my previous one.I give 4 stars because even if I have to snap 6 pictures in 5 seconds, one at least turns out & I just delete the others whereas I missed the shot entirely with my other camera!  My pictures are great. I need to work on action pictures so they are not blurry but I just read up on it last night & haven't had the chance to experiment yet.  So, if you are a mom like me & want great pictures of your little ones, I suggest this camera!

The lens on this camera is amazing. Equivalent to 300 mm in focal length, it's not removable from the camera body. This is great because you'll never contaminate the CCD in this gem. It has a well thought out selection of pre-sets, but still offers ease of manually configuring settings yourself.  With the SD 16 gig Extreme III Card, (the only one you should buy for this camera) in good lighting, it can snap off 3.5 frames per second of action in continuous shoot mode. Canon's Digic II processor and Face recognition auto focus, make this camera well worth more than you'll ever pay for it. This camera is feature rich, well built, and has too many extras to mention here.Altho the lens will not  accommodate filters, I managed to fit one on and found the camera takes much better photos with out it.  I was recently surprised after taking hundreds of photos, and finding the next day had battery power for hundreds of more using standard AA batteries.Just behind the flip-up flash, is a hot shoe for a more powerful flash, if you think you'll need one. But I've found the flip-up flash adequate for anything within 40 feet in total darkness. The infra red focus assist in darkness is a priceless, well though of, feature. Normally the camera uses its brain to focus in light on the subject, But if it can't see the subject or object in the dark, the infra red kicks in and gets the job done.The software included with the camera is compatible with my Mac OS 10, and Canon customer care is the best in the USA.

I would not say that any of the bad photos were because of the camera. Quite the opposite, I think it rescued some that would not have been very good on my older camera.The clarity and color on the photos is very, very good. In all kinds of lighting, from bright sunlight to normally lit rooms. Indoors I used the full manual mode a lot, with ISO 800 and 1600. I haven't tried printing anything, but on a 1920x1600 screen things look great.I also took about 12 minutes of video of my son's middle school orchestra, needing to shoot at ISO 1600. The sound quality was more than adequate from the rear of the auditorium. Definitely good enough to show the relatives.Overall, the camera has a lot of strong points - LCD is bright and the swivel helps get a lot of shots that would be impossible otherwise. Previewing manual mode shots is very good. The zoom is very quiet, and with all the sound muted (I'm not into having my camera make cute little noises) the camera is silent. Manual mode is easy to control with the scroll wheel. Super macro mode is great for flowers, etc.Cons - the lens cap has no tether. The lens hood will obscure the corners of wide angle shots.

Hyde", "ReviewID": "R9ZRQTLVKBETB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I typically shoot a Nikon D50 SLR, but for my recent trip to Hawaii I bought this camera so I wouldn't have to lug around any lenses. No camera bags or the like at Pearl Harbor so it's a pain to lug around extra lenses for the SLR but you want to have a nice long lens at the same time since Pearl Harbor really is an all-day visit. This camera solves the problem and then some. This allows for manual settings, as well as aperature and shutter priority that are typically only on SLR's. I was a bit skeptical if I would really like this camera since I'm used to SLR's - I love it! Simply stated, my shots were fantastic! I couldn't have done any better with my SLR (and this maybe did a better job than that - yikes). The resolution is astounding - I got such tight shots at the Pro Bowl with it too and I was no more than 10 rows from the top of Aloha Stadium. People can't believe I actually got the shots I did with this camera - I almost can't even believe it!  My 52mm UV filter from my Nikon fit this nicely, but my 52mm circular polarizer (made by the same company as the UV filter) did not.  It didn't matter - I got such beautiful shades of blue in the sky and water without it, though sometimes it is nice to have the creative control that the filter offers.  At the Pacific Aviation Museum I was able to shoot crisp, clear photos indoors without using the flash or a tripod when I put it on the Tungsten setting - outstanding results that exactly captured the Museum's lighting.I still prefer my SLR for more formal portraits and macro work, but for nearly every other type of photo the SX10 IS will likely be the one I reach for first.  I'm recommending it to everyone I know who's looking for a camera that's more advanced than a typical point and shoot, but who doesn't want to get into the SLR realm.  An enthusiastic 5 stars and kudos to Canon!  Well done!My suggestions for making the most out of this camera:- The rechargeable batteries promoted by the bunny with his drum work very well with this and last a good long time, even with moderate to heavy use.  I have the 15 minute recharger that has a car adapter too, which is handy for people like me who travel a lot.  Consider a second set of rechargeables to have ready at any time or at the very least keep 4 AA batteries on hand as a back up.  Overall, don't go on the budget plan for your rechargeable batteries for this great camera - you'll get what you pay for.- If you want to keep your charger with your camera then don't buy a bag online - they probably won't have the capacity to hold both the camera and the charger unit.  Go to a local retailer and pick one up there.- Get a 52mm UV filter, blower brush, lens cloth and cap keeper while you're at it.  They should total no more than $25 and are well worth the small investment.- Consider picking up the laminated cheat sheet that an Amazon retailer offers.  I found it by typing the camera's name under the \"books\" menu.  It's about $15 with the shipping, but less cumbersome than the manual.

Video quality is likewise superb and is one reason that this is my take-everywhere camera.  The fact that it has a hotshoe allowing you to add a pro-level flash (e.g. 430EX) adds to the versatility of this camera.  Also appreciated is the swivel LCD.  This is a carry-over from older models.  Few cameras offer this now.  For most shooting, I prefer the optical viewfinder, but you'll be surprised how many uses you find for an LCD like this.Is this camera for you?  That all depends on what you'll do with the camera. The zoom feature (including wide angle), combined with excellent image quality, is really what pushes this camera over the top for me.  There is very little you cannot do with this camera.

The SX10 is just about the same form factor, though deliberately a bit easier to grip, but delivers sharper images at all focal lengths, far longer focal lengths, and somewhat greater and much more easily accessed control of the settings for individual shots. Like its predecessor, the SX10 does not allow for saving shots as .RAW files, which is probably a good thing for Canon, because if they did the rationale for buying their mainstream digital SLRs would be less compelling.I like Canon equipment very well and was inclined to upgrade into their product line, but compared the SX10 with as much of the competition as reasonable before biting the bullet. THe cameras I fussed with the most are the Canon G10, which adds .RAW files but has a much more limited optical zoom capability, and the Panasonic DMC-LX3. I nearly bought the latter, in fact, because it has much higher resolution video available, but at some cost to picture quality. Ultimately, I decided that I'd use a video camera for videos, and hence picture quality won out.Aside from its limited f-stop range (endemic to its competitors), and its rather odd failure to include .RAW files, the limitations of the SX10 show up in comparison to digital SLRs. Aside from a comparatively circumspect range of f-stops, the focusing alternatives tend to be more restricted, the photo quality above about ISO 400 deteriorates pretty obviously, and the time between photos at maximum rep is actually lower than for the venerable S#. So if you spend a lot of time taking action photos, or shooting pictures at very low lighting, then consider the G10 or its competitors. If 90% of your shots are taking in reasonably lighting without lots of action, as are most of mine, then you will be VERY hard pressed to find a better compromise camera.

I've discarded about 5% of the shot I've taken due mainly to poor exposure or focus, but have learned how to aim the focusing points and exposure metering properly to eliminate those problems.My previous cameras were: Nikon FM2, Canon RebelG (35mm), Canon A70, Canon A75, and Canon SD600.  The SX10 reminds me of the RebelG in terms of flexibility and ease of use.I like Canon's use of AA batteries and SDHC memory cards, both of which are inexpensive and readily available. I was able to get a pair of Sandisk 8gb Extreme II and 3 Sandisk 4gb Extreme III SDHC cards for under $25 each during Black Friday sales, which should be more than sufficient for any future trips I take.I would strongly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a feature-packed point & shoot that is willing to sacrifice camera size for capability.", "Date": "December 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Lens Cap", "Author": "Elvio J.

I needed wins in both these areas so I went with the older SX10. There must be a reason that they keep it in the lineup even after its replacements have been brought to market. Being my first serious digital camera, and coming from a film SLR background, I find I use the viewfinder as much as the LCD.  I will grow into the LCD use I am sure. I was concerned by the reports that this camera does not take good pictures. I find it is very sharp right out of the box. It can not stretch the envelope with low light, way out zoom, ultra slow shutter speeds, but within these limitations I have been producing some very credible pictures after only a few days.  They will only get better as I learn about this tool and get a tripod. I have not tried the video feature yet.

The picture quality is amazing, and crisp, the colors are very vivid. I love the display screen that I can turn around to keep closed when my camera is in my bag to avoid getting scratches on it, and the way the screen flips over has been really useful in taking pictures of yourself grouped up with friends when no one else is there to do so, instead of just guessing if your all in the frame you can actually see it.The self timer and face self timer function lets you take up to 10 pictures and instantly recognizes your face and has let me take incredible pictures on top of mountains and in remote areas on my travels in Turkey and Europe. You can just set up the camera and when you get into range look straight at it and it begins taking pictures clicking away 10 times,or less depending on your setting. You can keep the volume up so you can hear when its taking a picture or keep it low if you are indoors and don't want the sound to be heard. This is an incredibly useful function.The panoramic assist function and the zoom browser stitch software have let me put together incredibly stunning views of entire cities on my journey that I have been able to take from high locations by hand without they use of a tripod.The zoom on this thing is incredible. If you are thinking, do I really need 20x zoom? I was thinking the same thing, but traveling around when I am inside a building with huge domes and high ceilings the zoom lets me stand in one place and get close up to all the incredible details and capture them perfectly, the zoom is incredible, and allows you to shoot wide shots or get very close up to the tiny details you wouldn't even be able to see otherwise. I was able to take pictures of the moon with the super zoom and without a tripod, and of sunrises and scenes as well as indoor shots of details inside of high domes and all have come out stunning with little effort from me.The video function on this camera is also very good and has allowed me to get some great videos of interiors of buildings and outdoors too. The wide angle lens is incredible for capturing ALOT of detail a big scene or the large facade of a building. This camera has great features and great picture quality and is incredibly easy to use, even for the beginner and has enough flexibility that you can work with the manual controls if you want to be more creative.criticisms:The lowlight pictures could be better, they do tend to get grainy in extreme lowlight so you have to watch the iso, I guess this is what the manual settings are for so if you are good with that sort of thing you can probably change it around to get much better results. I haven't been able to master the settings yet but I havent had to I have been getting great pics on the go throughout.My other criticism would be that sometimes you have to watch what batteries you buy because even if your batteries are fully charged they wont be recognized by the camera. I had some trouble because the camera would not recognize my rechargeable energizer batteries which I bought with a charger for my travels so the whole thing went to waste and I had to keep buying duracell batteries wherever I went. It does recognize duracell and a few other types though, you can google it to see the best type. As long as you have the right kind of battery on had it lasts for awhile without giving you trouble but just beware of investing too much in a battery and charger that wont work for this camera.neither of these are fatal flaws though.

You can even set the Red in the Colors menu. But just changing the light source makes all the diffence in the world! The most amazing thing with this camera is the Stabilization!!! You can free hand all the way into the digital zoom and have your pictures come out clearer and better than they even look through the lcd. I'm constantly amazed at how stable it is. That's what made me choose this over the Nikon with 20x optical zoom and the rest of the competition. Just zoom out in the store and watch it find and track Faces from 10' to 100'. It even seperates the Facial Recognition pic.s when you download into it's own file, just faces.Just for the hell-of-it, when I registered this camera, I let CANON know that my 4 year old A75 PowerShot stopped working. It blurred out with purple vertical lines. They said to send it in and they'd fix it for free if it was one of those that got a bad CCD. Ten minutes ago the Fed Ex guy brought it back and it's fixed!!! FREE, new CCD and adjusted and cleaned! Amazing. Just that alone makes me glad that I picked the Canon. What other company would pay shipping and fix a 4 year old camera for FREE?! NONE!!! Very Impressed with Canon. They've made me a loyal customer for life. They probably fixed it because I just bought this SX10IS. But, they didn't have to. I never expected them to do this.

Getting it to focus properly in the environments I used it in (I was photographing performers at music events) was pretty frustrating at times, but once I got to know it well enough it was better.  The built-in flash is fairly useless for low light settings where the subject is more than a few feet away.  Also a problem with the built-in flash if you plan on using it: if you have the Lens Hood attached, there will be a shadow along the bottom of your photos because the built-in flash does not project far enough over it.I also got this for the video capability but was very annoyed by the sound recording.  In loud environments, even on the lowest input-volume setting, it will record with lots of distortion.

I was a strong Canon fan due to two other Canon digital point and shoot cameras in our household.This time I was ready for a more DLSR camera and shooting experience. I was hesitant to invest thousands of dollars like I had with a film based DLSR years ago. One of the things that lead me to get this camera was that I remembered I did not often use my DLSR since it was a logistical hassle bringing all the lens, flashes, and equipment around.  Once I realized this self truth, I looked to see what my options were.  So when I saw the impressive specs on this camera, I had to try it out. Good choice on my part.I could not believe how much of a powerful and clear zoom lens this camera has! This camera is pretty fast in terms of frames/second and startup time for such an \"entry level\" camera.The macro capability was quite impressive, as was the depth of field capabilities. These were two features that I was missing in other point and shoots, and I could not be happier with the quality in this camera.Dark environments are usually well captured, and I find that most pictures in the 400-800 ISO range to be quite usable as long as there is reasonable room lighting and no extremes of motion.An added bonus was the video camera with stereo sound. I did not buy the camera for this feature, but I was delighted to find it so excellent. It easily equals my old Sony DV camera in all ways except night vision capability.Unfortunately, my wife tended to use it so much that I felt she should have it. I bought a replacement camera that did not work out quite as well as this Canon PowerShot SX10 IS camera. Even though the replacement (Nikon Coolpix P90)was similar in feature sets and functionality. The Nikon P90 is a very nice camera, but having both in our household, I just like the Canon considerably better.I ended up buying another PowerShot SX10 IS to replace my replacement Nikon P90. After using this Canon camera for awhile after using the Nikon, I will simply state that I am a full=fledged Canon enthusiast.Reasons I like it (and why I think it is better than my Nikon Coolpix P90):* Better (and more natural) clarity and color* When using auto-focus, I find the pictures quite Good!* The telephoto can be used in all lighting environments  (even if it is grainy at high ISOs)* The macro feature is really  tremendous* Stunned by how good the NTSC 640 x 480 video and sound  is (just wish it was HD)* Slightly more intuitive menus and functionality* Better flexibility with LCD screen (though the Nikon is a nicer screen)* Much fewer blurry pictures in various manual modes and/or auto modes* Image stability function is better on this cameraThis is one person's impression. Is it a perfect camera? No, but I truly believe that the Canon PowerShot SX10IS is a truly GREAT camera for new or experienced photographers, who want good flexibility,  convenience, and excellent image results.When it gets RAW capability and true HD video (1080p) then it will be perfect (for me) and called the \"Canon PowerShot SX30IS\",  or the Canon PowerShot SX1 IS minus $100.", "Date": "October 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Perfect Camera!

As you know there are plenty of diehard Canon and Sony lovers that have reviewed their particular purchase.  I have not been brand loyal when it comes to digital cameras.  I have had mostly Sony's, a few Canon's and some lower end Kodak's.  So when I finally made my decision to push that order button on the Canon SX10IS it was because I felt it was the best camera for me.I was in a heated internal battle between the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H50 and the Canon PowerShot SX10IS.  Both cameras have great ratings and reviews on Amazon and other electronic sites. One small thing to others was a big thing to me, the battery situation.  I prefer to be able to use AA batteries over having to buy Sony batteries. Just for the ease of AA being handy no matter where I go.  The other selling points for me were the flip LCD screen and the hot shoe feature for future use if I decide to get serious with my photos.I have waited to post my review because I wanted to use the Canon a while before giving my final thoughts.  I am by no means a top tier photo person and I do not know half of what my Canon will actually do (yet, still reading the manual as needed).  However, I can honestly say the pictures are flat out beautiful that I have been taking.  The 20X zoom is far more than enough for all my needs. The pictures I was taking so impressed the folks sitting next to me at a recent concert that they wrote down the model of the Canon so they could go home and order it from Amazon too!  We were sitting in the middle of the arena and my shots of the singers are like I was in the third row.  Not only are the pictures great because you can actually see who is on stage (unlike some of my previous camera's photos due to low zoom capability), but they are also so crisp.  A major concern of mine prior to buying my camera was that there are not too many reviews that talk about concert photos. I give an A+++ on this bad boy when it comes to concerts.The Canon SX10IS is a tad heavier than the Sony DSC-H50, but after holding both I liked the little extra weight.

Battery life is not an issue I use 4 AA NiMH rechargeable battery's and they last quite well. I have not yet reached the limit they have not gone dead while shooting yet, over 200 pix on several occasions and a lot of shorter uses where I shoot 20-30 pix throw it back in the case and get it out later for more shots. I'm not sure what the limit is but it has lasted all day with a lot of turned on time w/LCD on and over 200 pix.Pro: Sunny outdoor shots are sharp and have great color, 20X zoom, image stabilization is adequate, battery life.Con: The camera has a lot of settings and adjustments, in my opinion its more complicated than it needs to be.  The preset dial has a lot of settings but does not have an indoor light setting, my Panasonic had setting for incandescent and florescent lighting which made it simple. I get a lot of blurred shots with the Cannon SX10 indoors or in low light conditions even with its night shot setting.

So far the photos have been pretty good, with only a few blurred.  Colors appear clear and bright.  Battery life appears to be pretty good.

It is only good for aiming the camera at an object and trusting the auto-focus to get the shot.  It usually does a good job of focusing if given enough time for the autofocus to engage.  The digital viewer works great though.  The bigger issue is with the time it takes to refresh in between shots.  If you need to take a series of shots within 3 seconds, forget it.

If you're holding the camera like you would a DSLR, you may pinch your fingers, or prevent the lens from withdrawing all the way (which may ruin the lens motor).Although this is a great camera, I'm considering getting a DSLR for a few reasons:1) Low light performance is a lot better2) Changing the aperture changes depth of field...doesn't really work in this camera3) Faster continuous burst (didn't think it was important at first)4) Faster more reliable autofocus5) Better manual focus (100% zoom in live view and focus ring on lens is probably (hopefully) better than the wheel on the SX10 IS.6) More durable buildI'm still planning on keeping this camera though, as it is a small, lightweight camera that I can carry around w/ me at all times that also has a great range lens.The reviews say that this camera is one of the best super zooms out there, and although I don't have any other camera to compare it to, I still have to agree.Chris", "Date": "June 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot SX10IS", "Author": "Beatrice M.

IF they could afford it and the lenses they'd like.The image quality of the Canon SX10IS is pretty good but you always give up some image quality to gain such a large zoom range so there is a small bit of chromatic aberration, purple fringing, in the extreme zoom ranges.The one thing that I do miss is a remote shutter release, I like to do night photography. The 2 second self-timer setting helps a bit to overcome this oversight. Also the operating temperature range is a bit limited, 32 degrees F. Anyone who likes to take winter photos may have to keep the camera under cover, against their bodies when not shooting. I haven't tried it in below freezing temperatures yet so I don't know the practical limitations as yet.If even this price range is too much I'd strongly suggest the Fujifilm Finepix S1000fd at less then half the price. It has most of the features though less zoom and no external flash hotshoe. I bought the Fuji as an early Christmas present for my girlfriend and she's quite enjoying it.March 9, 2009 UPDATE:This has been a very good \"consumer\" camera but there are two things that bug me about it so far.The first is that the Command Dial (I think that's what they call it) is not very responsive at all. You'll see other people complain about it as well. If you are using the dial to make exposure adjustments or if you are selecting \"Scene\" settings then jerk the dial in 1/4 turn increments. Simply using a smooth dialing motion won't work. Secondly, it really sucks for manually focusing! It is really hard to manually focus this camera. *so sad*Secondly... because this is a consumer level camera the CCD sensor, the chip that senses the light in place of film, is a smaller sensor then pro or semi-pro cameras. This has the very sad side effect of creating \"digital noise\". This is the equivalent of higher ASA/ISO film having more grain and in some ways is to be expected BUT if you can afford one of the higher priced DSLR cameras then I'd go for that as the larger sensors have less digital noise.If you want to get a little better image out of this smaller sensor try using the \"dust and scratch\" removal settings in your photo editing software. Try a 2 pixel setting first.Overall it is still a great camera.

Without being too technical, I can say that the camera's value for money is very good in its own class.My only complain is the low light performance, especially the video. I tested the camera indoors during a school concert and I was surprised to find that the camera struggled to keep the subject in focus during video recording. I have never experienced that with the S3 or the S2 that i owned previously. Moreover, still pictures taken in low lights also are affected by the camera's weak autofocusing. I was prepared to live with the conversion from the AVI to the MOV format but the low light performance is really a turn off for me.A major strength of the IS series was the excellent movie mode with zoom and stereo sound and I did not feel the need to carry my camcorder for recording movies.If you own an S3 or an S5, I would recommend not upgrading rt now. I am on the verge of returning the camera after christmas primarily to the Poor low light performance.Update (12/27/2008)Returned the camera today.

One set of batteries takes about 400-600 photos (without flash).  I also purchased Bert's photo cheat sheet and the Short Course in Canon Powershot SX10 IS Photography book.I take a lot of cemetery headstone photos and it works great!Still learning!", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Notes for the aspiring photographer", "Author": "John Duval", "ReviewID": "R2P1QNPTBNRPME", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Flexibility is this cameras strong point. I bought this camera as my first foray beyond point-and-shoot, and have been using it to learn more serious photographic techniques. I am mainly interested in landscapes, but also do macros, wildlife, product photos, family and pets. You can do almost any type of photography with it with as much or as little automation as you need, and get very good results. It is hard to beat that zoom lens short of a DSLR, but there are limitations. If these issues are important to you, there are cameras by Cannon and others that may be a better match for your needs, but without the very handy zoom.Camera ModesI tried fully automatic, and though it was far and away the best full automatic I have ever tried, I never use it. I use manual mode almost exclusively because the results are far-far better still. I especially like the C mode, where it remembers the settings I like best.Depth of FieldShallow depth of field is not possible. As with all cameras in this class, the sensor is very small. If you check a hyperfocal chart, you will see that the range of focus is always very broad regardless of aperture. While you can focus on a flower within millimeters of the lens, you won't get that nice out of focus background even at f2.8. Comparing test photos of landscapes with objects from 12\" to infinity, at every aperture between f2.8 and f8 (the full available range), everything was in focus almost equally. P&S; people probably would consider this an advantage, but the aspiring photographer would not.Speed vs. ResolutionIf you want to photograph birds, animals and action, you need strong light. While the speed of this camera is excellent, short of a DSLR, balancing between low ISO for sharpness and fast shutter speed for eliminating blur can keep you turning dials instead of watching for that special moment. I haven't gotten a good bird shot yet.LightUsing a tripod I have gotten many beautiful shots between 80-400 ISO. Hand held shots up to 1/32 second are not a problem with the stabilizer. Indoor shots with ambient light are good as long as the subject is still and there is contrast to focus on. The live histogram can be way off under low light conditions, but the playback histogram is a good guide for proper exposure. The spot meter and +/-2 stop indicator works great for the Zone system. Detail falls off quickly at about +1-1/3 stops but holds down to about -3 stops, so erring on the under-exposure side works best. The aperture does not go down very small, so long exposures for blurring waves and waterfalls requires very low light or ND filters.OtherThis camera has no RAW format. You have to buy its stable mate at +$100 to get that. 52mm filters can be screwed in, though the lens isn't actually threaded for them and it is fussy. A third party adaptor for 58mm filters is available, which makes filter changes much easier. Vignetting is the same either filter size and starts when 2 filters are stacked at full wide angle. Lens flare shows up in my photos frequently, so I bought an oversized aftermarket lens hood and screwed it to the 58mm filter adaptor.Overall I would say the SX10is was a good choice, given that as a beginning photographer I had little real basis to make a decision. I needed a safe, jack-of-all-trades to gain some experience and learn with. Though I have found some limitations to the camera, I will be the greater limitation to its potential for quite some time. In 2-3 years, digital cameras will be even better, and the potential of a more expensive model will not have been wasted on my meager skills.", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Totally AWESOME!", "Author": "Susan Dever \"Sue\"", "ReviewID": "RC0RVPP9E1MZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great shots, easy to use.

To be fair, I have only owned 2 previous digital cameras - an ancient Canon Powershot, and a Sony. This camera, however, is as close as you could get to a DSLR quality image, while still being a point and shoot.I was going back and forth deciding to buy this camera, or the Canon G10. While the G10 boasts 4 more megapixels, I am confident that this is a far better purchase. The price is FAR lower, and the image quality, I find, is the same, if not better. What really makes this camera knock the G10 out of the water is the zoom. The zoom is absolutely incredible. I researched both models for weeks before buying, and I just cannot find any real justification for the enormous price difference between the two cameras.The rotating LCD screen on this camera is a huge plus as well. Especially when taking a self-timer shot, I like to rotate the LCD screen to face me while I position the camera. And when shooting in macro, you can tilt the screen up to face you so you don't have to get down on the ground and use the view finder (like when shooting flowers and plants that may be low to the ground).It's fairly easy to learn how to use, though I still haven't gotten the hang of taking good indoor and night time photos. For that, I'm sure, a tri-pod would be of good use.Read the manual, it's very helpful.I have gotten so many compliments on the shots I have taken with this camera already. The macro and supermacro modes are outstanding, as is the portrait mode. They both produce beautiful clearly focused images with a nice blurred background.The color options are fantastic as well - I love shooting in vivid colors and sepia tone.This camera is  a MUST BUY.", "Date": "August 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great overall camera.", "Author": "Alex Prats", "ReviewID": "R1AMP0LPUY7ZUM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Im  in love with my new camera.

I love the zoom lens, especially nice when I can't get as close as I want for one reason or another  ... it brings the subject to me.  It's especially useful for wildlife and nature shots.Picture quality?  Amazing.I want to highlight how useful the articulated screen is. They aren't available on many point and shoot cameras any more (if they ever were) but they are a real plus!  They enable you to take photos from all sorts of awkward, odd angles - even over your head - and still see your viewscreen clearly to compose your shot.  Additionally, the viewscreen has excellent resolution/clarity, making it invaluable, and there is a pretty decent viewfinder for those times only a viewfinder will do.  The camera's  flash is adequate for typical uses and a standard external flash connection is built in, which is a real plus.The SX-10 is a bit heavier and bulkier than other cameras I have used or have now but it is surprisingly easy to hold, with a \"natural\" handle built into the design.

Well, I was soooo dissapointed with the colors and lack of depth, faces washed out, horrible. I wanted to wait for the faster SX1is but I went back and bought the Canon SX10is instead.The Canon SX10is is very well built and feels solid, impressive lens, zoom in all the way and grab some blur-free shots you won't believe! Grab birds out of the sky! I don't know how I made it without Image Stabilisation all these years. I like the \"common sense\" menus, the AA batteries (I use 2900MAH NiMh) and they last all day.  The zoom has two speeds, Fast to get to where you want it and slow to \"fine tune\" the zoom. During Video, only \"slow zoom\" will work (makes sense). The grip could be bigger but I have large hands. Auto does very well, but sometimes I want to customize the flash settings and It does that well. My Fuji S9000 has almost NO shutter lag or delay, when I pre-focus before the shot, It's INSTANT. With the Canon there is a 2-4 sec delay (with flash) but it can be reduced a little through the Menu settings. You can set it to \"P\", \"Force Flash\" and It will pull off continous shots at around 1.5 seconds one after the other.  For a P&S; up against other P&S;'s I give it a 4.5 stars but here in the real world up against cameras that are also within reach, Nikon D40, Lumix G1, It's a solid 3.5.

I love this camera for the price.  The cameras need to fit the purpose and mine was to have a powerful zoom without losing the ability for video which is why I did not upgrade to a SLR type.  I mainly take pictures of my kids. I like the shot to shot speed of this camera and I can get the kids in action while having great clarity, focus and no jitter.  I especially like the fact it uses plain AA batteries.  I wish the lens cap would attach to the camera but that's a small con to the many pros.  I didn't read any instructions and was able to figure out where and how to operate the main functions of picture review, delete, video settings/volume, flash, and ISO within 15 minutes of turning on the camera.  The pictures and video is great to view on a computer or tv.  I do like the flip out screen because my old one had scratches from being exposed where this screen is protected by closing inward.  Modifying zoom while taking video is also a nice feature to have.  I am very pleased with this camera and purchase...now I have to find a case.", "Date": "January 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera", "Author": "Richard Perlin \"rp401k\"", "ReviewID": "R2F3CA6CCD42IT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We purchased this camera to update our existing Canon S2IS just before our first trip to Israel. Overall, this camera was excellent and consistently took great pictures. I shot about 1,300 pictures, some under very challenging conistions. The menus and operation were somewhat similar to our old S2IS so there was very little learning curve.Modes used: I shot most pictures using the \"P\" mode which allows some manual settings such as ISO, white balance, flash strength, and exposure adjustment. The remainder I shot in manual mode.What I liked: The old S2IS often took a long time to lock focus. This camera focuses very quickly allowing me to get a lot of \"just now\" shots. The image stabilizer, like the one in the S2IS was phenominal. With still subjects, I could consistently get clean, well focused shots at 1/8 second, and I have a slight hand tremor. Sometimes I could get good shots at slower shutter speeds. This really helped indoors where flashes were not permitted, or the subjects were distant. It also helped a lot at night. Another huge feature is the range of the lens. It goes from slightly telephoto at 28mm to 560 mm (20X zoom). I was able to get shots of things I could hardly see with my naked eye. I was also able to get close ups at great distance. Many of my best shots were at high zoom. With dslr's you often have to change lenses and these shots would have been missed. The manual settings were generally easy to use and really expanded the pictures we could shoot. Generally, I used shutter priority. I really liked the electronic viewfinder. It saves battery power and accurately shows how a shot will be exposed. It also has a diopter adjustment. The flip out and twist tilt screen was also a help with crowd shots. The flash was strong and can be enhanced.  In addition, there is a \"hot shoe\" for an add on flash. I did not have an add on flash, but I can see how it would be useful in lower light conditions. I discovered there is a \"mute\" button on the top left that suppresses all noise. This is handy when you can't be obtrusive. To turn sounds back on, you have to go into the menu. Battery life was also very good. I used rechargable nmh batteries that when fully charged would handle the almost 200 shots per day without indicating much use on the battery level indicator. Overall the camera provided well focused and well exposed shots in a variety of conditions, with plenty of adjustments and clever features.What could be better: Occasionally the autofocus would be fooled in low light or with objects intervening between me and the subject. I would revert to the manual focus mode, but it was a little awkward to use. In shutter priority mode, you spin a wheel on the back of the camera to adjust shutter speed. The change in shutter speed did not respond predictably to my thumbing of the wheel. Not a major problem, but I noticed it. In cloudy lighting (much of our trip in December) some shots were a bit overexposed in \"P\" mode inducing me to use shutter priority. To be fair the shots would often consist of brighter sky, and darker buildings. The camera does have several exposure algorithms to choose, but I stayed with the default. And since this is a point and shoot, and not a dslr, shooting at higher ISO's resulted in somewhat grainy pictures. The highest ISO I used was 800, sometimes at night and sometimes in caves so the \"noise\" was not all that relevant to the picture quality.I gave the camera 4 stars because it was excellent, but not perfect.Update June 17, 2009: I have happily used this camera for family and school events since my last review and I am very pleased. I also shot an Ultimate Frisbee tournament that my son participated in and was held indoors. With indoor lighting, I was not able to capture very many good shots, even when overiding shutter speed settings and shooting at 800 ISO. I ended up taking most of the pictures using a dSLR from my son's school newspaper.  There was a world of difference in quality.  The better sensor of the dSLR was able to handle the lower light with no problem.  I am still very pleased with the SX10IS, its fine overall picture quality, and many features, but recognize the limitations of its point and shoot sensor.", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon SX10 IS User Review", "Author": "Rudy Willis \"SoupStone\"", "ReviewID": "R1BFYLF3N1N31U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera replaced Posershot S3 as a walk around.

I was rather hesitant to buy this camera because of the bad reviews I read, but I am so glad I decided to get it anyway.  The 20x zoom is amazing, and the macro ability is equally impressive.  It takes clear, focused close-ups, even if the subject is touching the lens!  Another great feature of this camera is the amount of control it allows you to have over the settings.  It is very helpful to be able to adjust the white balance, shutter speed, and aperture while shooting.  It also has many, many other settings that allow you to have full control over your images.  Although I haven't used the video feature much, it seems alright.  Of course it's videos aren't as good as those of a proper camcorder, but it still takes clear enough videos to record some good memories.Overall, this is a fantastic camera!  As far as cons go, there isn't a lot.  The only thing I can think of, is the time you must spend with the manual.  I'd say it takes a good couple of hours with the manual to get an idea of how to use the features.  Even after you've studied the manual for a while, keep it around for future reference.

After reading many reviews about many cameras I chose the CANON SX10 IS. Right out of the box just point and shoot. I have found this camera amateur friendly. My dogs tend to be black or white... Westies and Labradors. No longer do I get just a profile outline of my Lab, or a white blob of my Westie. Gone are the green ghoul eyes. The video is as crisp as the photos. The sound recording on video is clear, too. Important if you want the sound of your little puppies at play. Most important is how silent the camera is to operate. My dogs no longer hear the camera come out of the bag, power up, focus, and shoot. Even the flash doesn't disturb them. Portrait photos of family are priceless. I can't wait to start photographing wildlife.I live in the Blue Ridge Mountains where \"teaming with wildlife\"is an understatement. Turkeys, deer, birds, geese, ducks, wolves, cyotes, mountain lions, lynx, bobcats,etc. have appeared in my side, front,and backyard. A positive for a budding wildlife photographer... a nightmare when walking the dogs. \"GET OUT OF HERE!\" doesn't exactly intimidate timber wolves that appear on the edge of your yard while walking a six month old Labrador. Having lived here all of my life, however, I do know how to stay safe, the agricultural biology degree doesn't hurt, either.The LCD screen is big enough for me, especially with its flexibility. A rubber eye piece (eyepieces@cheltenhamas.com)  makes the view finder VERY efficient... highly recommended.  The ease of use of the automatic controls to the ability of full manual control, with the ability to add attachments using a converter ring (52mm-58mm)and the hot shoe for an additional flash makes this camera limitless.

She is always wanting to photograph things that are just too far away for her point and shoot camera. Our first adventure with the new camera was a whale watching tour in the San Juan Islands. I shot my 20D with Canon's 100-400 IS and she used her new Powershot SX10IS. The images she got were great and perfect for travel snaps, but not of the same quality put out by the 20D outfit.

The SX 10IS will not replace a SLR with good lenses.All controls are easy to find and use. Very little learning required. The movable video screen makes it easy to shoot and view photos. I found the eye piece video hard to use with glasses so never used it. It was like sitting too close to a TV screen, everything was fuzzy. The camera is perfect for smaller hands yet works well for those with bigger mitts as well. The lens comes with a shade but be careful that you don't knock it out of position or it will show up in your wide angle shots. Threads are a little light and it does seem to move too easy.

I have only had the SX 10 for a little over a month and i wanted to be fully familiar with it before i wrote a review on it. I decided to get the SX 10 for several reasons. Cost, Quality, Functionality, and Ease Of Use. I have been using Canon cameras for many years. I love Canon products, they have never let me down. To me this camera is the best of both worlds. I do a lot of landscape and nature photography and so i really need the wide angle and the telephoto reach. The macro and supermacro modes are outstanding. To me the 5.0-100.0mm (35mm equivalent: 28-560mm) Lens is the most amazing thing about this camera. The lens on this camera is truly amazing. You can really reach out and touch somebody with this bad boy.The Canon SX 10 IS is a excellent choice if you don't have the money for DSLR. I am still learning and this camera is certainly a great one to learn with because you have many of the functions of a good DSLR. The Auto mode works really well and you can get away with most shots by simply point and shoot. But for the shots that you cant pull of in Auto you have the ability to go full Manual Which i love. There are way too many great functions on this camera for me to list. I didn't buy this camera for the video but the video is fantastic as well. I was actually shocked the first time i the recorded a practice session of my friends band, the audio and video quality are truly awesome. The SX 10 really is the one of the closest things you can get to DSLR without having to spend thousands of dollars.A lot of people seem to think that you can't use lens filters with the SX10, but they couldn't be more wrong. Just google Lensmate SX 10. I got the Lensmate Adapter 58mm, Hoya UV filter 58mm, an extra Lens Cap 58mm to fit the UV filter, and a Hoya HMC Circular Polarizer 58 mm and a few other goodies. I leave the Lensmate Adapter and the UV filter on the SX10 at all times to protect the main lens. This is the perfect addition. You can have a lot of fun with a Cir Polarizer. They are very useful for Landscape Photography because they help make the skies blue and the clouds white as they should be. The Polarizer is also great for taking the reflections off of water or glass.My only complaint with this camera is Canon or actually Myself. I bought this camera about a month ago and about two weeks later Canon sent me an email saying that the Canon Powershot SX 20 was about to be released. That really struck a nerve ha. I really don't know how they could improve this model very much but i would have definitely loved to have had a heads up about the new SX 20 IS. Oh Well i guess that's what i get for not doing more research. I am certainly very happy with the SX 10. And with this model i can use the Canon Powershot SX10 IS CHDK Hack to unlock many more functions and capabilities such as RAW Image Format, Time Lapse, Remote Shutter Release, Motion detection, Bracketing, DOF Calculator, ETC ETC.This was my first purchase from Amazon.com and i am extremely satisfied with Amazon. I ordered this camera late in the afternoon around 3:00pm or 4:00pm on a Thursday and it was at my house by 4:00pm Friday, ready for the weekend abuse.The Canon Powershot SX 10 IS is an excellent choice for beginner as well as advanced photographers.

Now, I really feel like I'm working with a \"real\" camera that is so far proving to give me the pro-like photos I want to achieve.  I'm also very determined to learn how to use this camera correctly.  I have been reading the manual and researching online so I know how to set my camera to the appropriate setting to achieve the desired look I want. Out of the box you can set this camera to auto and shoot away for great photos, but I believe that understanding how the camera works and its settings are going to give you the best quality shots.  I'm not going to lie, I don't have it all perfect yet!  Today I tried setting the self-timer and taking a few shots of the myself and the sun was really glaring on me in the photos, so I do have to work with the setting to perfect this!  Lastly, it's only been two days, so I have a long way to go, but so far I'm very satisfied with my canon. Some of the pictures I've taken are just gorgeous and look like postcards!  The price is also fantastic for this camera.  I remember paying more for my little point and shoot three years ago and the photos don't even compare!", "Date": "August 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "E.

The first one was the Canon S1 and it was also a great camera.  The zoom is ultrafast, so is the autofocus and colors and picture quality are outstanding.While in Alaska, the Face Detection technology even detected faces when taking photos of a totem.  That was kind of impressing.  But obviously that's not so important so I'll tell you more about my experience.  I enjoy taking wildlife and outdoor pictures very much and my Alaskan landscape pictures also came up great.  I even went on a whale watching tour and my pictures were sharper and with better exposure than those of the gentleman next to me on the boat that was using a Nikon with 24x optical zoom.I tried Panasonic and Kodak in between my last 2 Canons just for having a less bulky camera and the Kodak was cheap even performance-wise, the Panasonic was quite good but this one is by far the best of it's category.  The Vary-Angle LCD is a great plus even though I use mostly the viewfinder to extend battery life. I'll definitely stick to Canon and maybe next year will buy the Canon S20 so I can have HD movie capability.For those that don't want to put the lens cap in your pocket, just buy a lens cap string attachment for $3.99 in Radio-Shack or even from Amazon.Wrapping things up, you can't go wrong when buying Canon and this is definitely the best camera I've owned and that you can find in this price-range.", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "For the $$$ -- Wow!", "Author": "Susan A.

That was not acceptable to me.I was missing my old SLR and was willing to carry a larger camera if I could get better shots.So I ordered this camera, half expecting to send it back. But now I totally love it.The viewfinder on this one is not perfect but it's fantastic when I need it.I took a trip right after I got it, so had to use it without reading the manual. And it did fine. It's very intuitive, but reading the manual does help a lot.Everything is better than I expected, even the battery life -- I use rechargeable. The swivel LCD is fantastic! Now I can't imagine having a camera without one.Two things I don't like are 1.- Using the flash. But then I never like to use it on any camera. And I do need to get better at shooting in low light without the flash. And 2. - Dealing with a loose lens cap.

The SX10 offers some significant upgrades over its predecessor, the S5: in addition to a huge jump in lens range, from 12x to 20x, it also bumps up a couple megapixels to 10 from 8. The latest generation of Canon imaging processors, Digic 4, adds tweaks to face detection, Servo AF, Face Detection Self-Timer, and Intelligent Contrast Correction.Keeping a mostly similar design to the S5, the SX10 follows in its footsteps as a very comfortable to hold and shoot camera, retaining perks like the articulated LCD and four AA-powered operation. It's a little heavier, 1.5 pounds, which makes it feel like a dSLR, but the big grip gives you plenty of holding room. While it offers the same set of manual, semimanual, and automatic controls, they're differently designed and laid out. Gone is the multifunction power switch, leaving a plain old button in its wake. Now you have a more traditional button to jump into review mode; it sits near the indented thumb rest on the back, joined by the exposure compensation and focus area selection buttons.

I received my SX10IS on January 8, 2009 and I shot this video the next morning at a local park.  It was cold and windy and I was only carrying a mono pod.  I read a complaint about short battery life but it doesn't ring true for me.  I've shot a 2.5 minute video and a 26 minute video and about 400 images in 3 outings and I still have the same NiMH AA cells in the camera.  It looks like it's going to be a fun camera to carry around.  It's a bit larger but that's a plus for me. I'm glad they returned to putting the memory in it's own compartment because when shooting videos on a tripod it's very convenient not to have to take everything apart to change memory.  The video is a bit shaky.  It's at full zoom and the fox is about 100 yards from me.

Just Perfect!", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Weak replacement for the S1IS", "Author": "The Headhunter", "ReviewID": "R7E3638S6TB32", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My S1IS went back to the factory for a faulty image sensor on a recall a couple of years ago. A few months later, the lens retraction mechanism got stuck. Despire thousands of complaints about this problem, Canon never recalled the camera. After hours of trying to fix it myself (or pay 90% of the value of the camera for a repair?), I trashed it. Hesitated to try Canon again, but bought the SX10IS anyway.It was a mistake. Image quality in Auto mode pales compared to the S1IS. Low light? Forget it. Without a flash, you get unacceptable grain in even decent light levels. I wanna cry when I look at my old S1 images compared to the 10. The S1 was an incredible camera. You would never know it was only 3.2MP by looking at images it produced.The SX10IS is bulky and heavy for the feature set. The LCD is bigger, which is nice, but that's not a good tradeoff for the weight. The USB port sits behind a plastic door that does not open all the way, making it awkward to connect a cable. Menu settings are inconveniently organized, making it difficult and time-consuming to try to adjust settings to compensate for the inadequate Auto mode.It's beyond me why Canon still has not provided a lens cap with a string to keep the thing attached when you're shooting. Worse, the clip on the cap is poorly designed - it doesn't stay on.I have all sorts of Canon products in my home and office - scanners, printers, old SLR's (my 1984 A-1 is still my favorite camera - a work horse). I have always recommended Canon products. That's why I gave Canon the benefit of the doubt and replaced the S1 with the 10. Big mistake.When a $400 digital camera won't take a really good, quick snapshot on Auto under good light conditions, the camera design is poor. I gave this camera more than one star because it's got some redeeming qualities, including a nice face-focus, but it's not worth half the price I paid. Too bad. It has dimmed my opinion of Canon dramatically.In closing, I'll add that I'm not a pro, but I'm more than a novice. I read the manual cover to cover to find settings that helped the image quality of my photos. The results still don't come close to my old S1. I can't recommend this camera. Wish I had time to go research a good replacement...UPDATE Jue 16 2010: More time with this camera has just confirmed my experience. It takes poor photos. What mystifies me is how Canon produced such an incredible S1IS with just 3.2 MP, then bombed with the SX10IS. There is no amount of fiddling with settings that will allow me to produce the kinds of pix I got from the S1. I'm getting rid of it. Wish I could find another S1IS!

There are some differences, too, so there is a bit of a learning curve. However, the more I use the camera, the more I appreciate the changes. For example, to set the self-timer, I push a button on the back of the camera instead of one on the front top. The view finder is much more clear and the LCD screen is significantly larger than previous models - and very usable when I choose to not use the view finder. What I like about this over many cameras in its price range is that it has multiple automatic settings and it has manual settings for the serious amateur who wants full creative control over what the camera does. The ONLY down side I have found is that the camera really does not support lens filters. I have been able to gently screw the 52 mm UV filter from my old camera in place, and I have not had any problems doing so. But I can tell the few threads on the lens are not really intended for this use, so I won't be changing filters any more than absolutely necessary. If Canon would make that one change, I would say this is the perfect camera for someone who does not need the step up - in both price and weight, as well as cost - of a full DSLR, but who wants to do much more than point and shoot.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great for the Money / Would Rather have had SX1 IS", "Author": "Robert George-Johannes Tactius \"to_glow\"", "ReviewID": "R2GGID0HRGSGAM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Powershot SX10 IS is the best overall camera you can purchase for the money.  Money saving features are as follows:  AA batteries, SD Card, 28mm to 560mm lens.  Batteries are a big thing.  Rechargeables will not last forever, they wear even if you aren't using them.  When you need batteries, at the last minute, you can use Alkaline AA.  For your typical tourist activities the lens will be more than enough.  The SD cards are the cheapest around.The one additional feature the camera has is the menu/picture review screen. The screen works much like the screens on Digital Camcorders.  It allows moving the camera overhead and around corners or is just convenient for use when taking self-portraits on a timer.  You can rotate the screen around to point in the same direction as the lens.No other camera, other than the SX1 IS w/CMOS, combines all these features.  Since the SX1 IS is currently only being sold in Europe and Asia, at the time of this review, and any warranty work would be problematic this leaves out this camera. It's an extra $300-$400 extra the same price as a SLR, but you still have AA batteries and SD card.The picture quality is great, the addition of full manual control, VHS quality video and a High Speed ISO makes this camera a great buy and a bargain.PS:  10-24-2013I've been using this camera for about four years and haven't had any problems with it.  I would have bought the sequels to this model, SX30-HD and SX50-HD, but Canon for greedy and anti-green earth reasons have switched to a proprietary rechargeable battery system and I will not buy a camera that doesn't use AA batts.

During those days when I used the camera alot, I ran through a set of four alkaline AA batteries in one day. Be sure to have lots of extra batteries on hand!

I went out in Downtown Towson, Maryland taking pictures of whatever I fancied and most of the pictures taken were beautiful. I took about 100 pictures with my Cannon SX10IS using full auto mode and the color, saturation and exposure was awesome. I am NOT a photographer at all. I am about as green as you can get when it comes to taking pictures but, I know a good quality digital image when I see one. I work in digital imaging on computers for people who have visual disabilities.I love the pictures the Cannon SX10IS takes so much that I purchased 2 more newer nicer ones. It is almost impossible for me to take a bad picture with my Cannon SX10IS. The Cannon SX10IS is almost a point and shoot in its simplisticity. I took low light pictures in my home and they still look great. I do not doubt your skills as a photographer so you must have gotten a DAWG as a camera. Of 100 pictures I took with the Cannon SX10IS 70 of pictures are very good, 10 pictures are good. The leftover 20 or so pictures were all duds partly because; I'm not a skilled photographer. I had friends who ARE skilled PAID photographers who were astonished that I got such great prints out of a glorified point and shoot camera.My knowledge of the camera is still quite primitive but my shot composition skills rock! The Cannon SX10IS auto focus lets me avoid all that shutter, iso and appeture crap and focus on my composition skills where i shine. Oh in time I'll buy a DSLR to learn the exposure triad but for now I want a glorified point and shoot and the Cannon SX10IS fits the bill nicely for me.

I'd developed a hobby out of photography with a little Kodak point and shoot that I had before, but I was wanting to go to a higher level in my photography. This camera is a great camera for beginners for several reasons: 1) It takes awesome pictures on auto.  I used the auto setting almost all the time I used this camera. 2) It has lots of preset modes, such as portrait, landscape, sport, macro, and night portrait. And if you go to scene mode there are about 10 others!  One I thought was really cool is a feature that lets you select a color in your photo and it takes the shades of that color and turns everything else black and white. The macro and super macro settings take amazing pictures!! 3) It's a great step between point-and-shoots and SLRs.  There are custom modes you can experiment with, and there is more room for creativity because there are more settings to choose from than there are in the majority of point-and-shoot cameras. 4) The overall image quality I found to be better than point and shoots I've used.Other great qualities:I absolutely loved the swivel screen.  I'm pretty short so it helped a lot when I wanted to hold the camera up and get a shot from higher than eye level.  It's also great for getting pictures at ground level and all different angles.  I would suggest that when you're storing the camera and when you're carrying it to turn the screen so that the screen part faces in toward the camera body.  I didn't do that and I have some smudge-like scratches on mine now.The video was something I really liked.  I got a dSLR recently that does not have video and I have really missed it.  The video quality isn't great, but it's still really nice to have.The 10 megapixels make great pictures.  My camera before that had 6.1 and the dSLR I got has 6 and I miss the 10 megapixels.  I could take a picture, crop it quite a bit in Photoshop, and the image would still be very crisp.If you're considering this over an SLR, keep in mind that this camera will not give you the control that an SLR will.

The only hit I seen when I originally contemplating buying it was battery life but I use coppertops in it and they last plenty long enough. I can get several weeks of video shooting on a set of batteries. I'm glad I opted for this camera rather than one with a proprietary rechargeable as I just carry extra batteries in the carrying case and when I need them I'm back up and running in a few minutes. I didn't expect this camera to be good at video but it is better at video than any video camera I've had so far. As a still camera, I get a lot of compliments on the picture quality. There is a lot to learn if you want to use some of the manual features and yet if you don't want to mess with that, you just simply shoot pictures on the automatic setting and all defaults and the outcome is always very sharp and excellent color quality.

Rose", "ReviewID": "R11EUZ69JO14W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera (besides borrowing my mom's compact point-and-shoot) and so far I love it. I wanted a camera that would be able to take decent macro shots but could not afford a DSLR with macro lens. The SuperMacro setting on the Canon PowerShot SX10 works nicely for what I need (after I figured out that you need to set the camera into manual mode to use it). I'm impressed with the zoom as well. I've taken pictures of the moon that people won't believe I've taken without a telescope just using the zoom on the camera. I've read a few complaints about grainy pictures, but I find with using sufficient light, low ISO setting and manual mode this isn't really an issue. I take most of my pictures in manual mode and love fiddling around with the settings. I've been able to get a few surprisingly good bokeh shots as well using the zoom and/or macro settings.The only complaints I would have might be that it's too easy to accidentally press a button on the back of the camera when holding it, thus changing your settings in the middle of trying to take a picture. I've annoyed myself doing that on multiple occasions. I wished the manual focus would work a little better - it's sometimes challenging to get it right and it's a bit hit and miss. Most of the time, the auto focus and focus lock work fine for what I want to do though. And on the SuperMacro setting, it can be tricky to get the lighting right without casting a lens shadow on your subject, but I suspect that's probably an issue with all macro photography and I wouldn't hold that against the camera. If I could add something to the camera to make it better, I would suggest a thread to add filters etc and put the lens cap on a strap so it can't get lost. I know there are adapters and alternate lens caps available, but it would be nice not to have to purchase those extra.Update (December 2011): I've been using this camera for almost two and a half years now and have taken over 50,000 pictures with it for an average of 50-60 shots per day (gee, has it really been that many?), so I figured I would provide an update. I had to send it in once for repairs due to spots on images because \"the optical assembly did not operate properly\" and Canon fixed it for me under warranty. Since then the image quality has been great and seems still the same after 50,000+ shots.The zoom still works well most of the time, but occasionally will get temperamental and show me a \"lens error\" asking to restart the camera. The other error message I see quite a bit is \"E02\" which appears to be an autofocus error, though I have also seen it pop up when trying to use manual focus, and I had a bogus \"card error\" once. Turning the camera off and back on usually fixes these errors, but sometimes the camera keeps up with it and I have to put it away and give it a rest for a while. It happens most often in hot and/or humid weather, with heavy use (1000+ pictures in a day), and when I try to zoom at odd angles or with the Raynox lens attached.The Raynox macro conversion lens is a great addition to this camera, btw, and has given me some great macro shots. It does not require an adapter to be used with the camera. I've purchased a small SpeedLite flash (270EX) and have been very happy with it, too. It gives more power than the built-in flash and can be set to bounce off the ceiling. I've also purchased the Lensmate filter adapter and played around with 58 mm neutral density and polarizing filters. The camera works well with one filter attached, but more than one filter may give you vignetting at wide angle. All of these have been great and useful \"upgrades\" for the camera.As long as I only had the camera without any accessories, the Lowepro Edit 110 was the perfect camera bag for it. I had to upgrade to a larger bag to fit all the additional stuff that I bought though. Overall, I have been very happy with this camera, aside from the occasional \"lens error\" annoyance.", "Date": "February 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "A.

I was very happy with Canon for the past 5+ years using either the powershot IS or the ELPH series cameras.  Lately, I had a need for extra zoom for taking shots of kids at school stages, etc., so I reviewed several 'super zoom' cameras.Pros:o Zoom is great, although some reviews do not like that the camera shutter speed slows down as you zoom further out (at 20x, the fastest you get is 1/500)o LCD vari-screen is quite helpful (as opposed to the fixed LCDs in P&S;), specially when taking low shots of kids or birds, etc.o I didn't miss many of the automatic scene options I got used to in prev Canon cameraso I like the 'super macro' feature a lot.  I took some close up shots of a basket of oranges - great professional focus on the near orange surface, with short depth of field, and blurred background!Cons:o In automode, I'm just not seeing the image sharpness in the 'normal' zoom range.  The camera takes great shots of close-up pictures. Great details can be found when viewing on screen.  But try something 5-10 feet, and the AF just doesn't lock sharply.  Same in face-detection mode, even as the face is framed well.  I compared very similar shots from powershot and this camera. It just doesn't look consistently sharp. Ocassionally I'd get one or two sharp ones, but then I've had to work quite hard to do that - several adjustments of aperture, speed, etc. like some very old SLR shots without any auto features.o Images are very grainy, specially on the black colors even at low ISOso The highest resolution is 10M, then next down is 6M, which leaves a big gap on resolution.  I'd prefer 10M, 9M, 8M, etc.o The flash doesn't 'auto pop' in any mode.  I'd have preferred that in 'auto' mode that it pops up (like one old SLR I had), to retain the feel of a P&S; when neededo I'd prefer a rechargeable battery.  I take many pictures, so what is better to carry around, a large box of batteries or a charger?o The sport mode is disappointing!  I put it in sport mode and took several pictures of birds, some of my fish in the aquarium - not a single sharp shot!  Yes, I have steady hands :-)I'm somewhat happy with the features and superzoom and Canon's reputation. But, I'm not able to decide whether to try another camera before returning this.  Some symptoms indicate I may need to learn a few techniques, but I think at least the automode and scene modes should do as expected from sub $200 cameras!

It takes amazing photos, so i would highly recommend it.I won't go much into all the positives, because that has been well articulated by others.I love the swiveling LCD SCREEN, manual adjustments, the powerful zoom, face detect feature, and the crisp pictures it takes overall.Hower, HOW DUMB can CANON  engineers be to include some rather foolish poor designing in such a classy camera.Let Me Start:Number 1: You can use either the viewfinder, or the LCD Screen. So if you are using the viewfinder, and you take a shot, the recorded image will not show automatically on the lcd screen. Thus you have to tediously press the playback button to see the image, which leads me to my second point. (Note, on viewfinder mode, the shot imag shows in the viewfinder only)Number 2: Given the importance of the playback button, given Canon's initial bad choice one would have thought that the PLAYBACK button would be well designed. Not at all, the playback button is rather small, and in a slight sink, requiring a certain degree of effort to depress. What careless engineering!!!!!Number 3:  The right hand grip creaks slightly when grasped. I am not sure if others have this issue as well. It is very very very minor, but should not be there anyways.These are my gripes with the camera so far. Despite this, i am very happy with the camera and would purchase it again. especially if those 3 flaws are fixed.

Being somewhat new to online ordering and to photography, I was led to believe the Pro Kit was a collection of accessories for THIS particular camera. It turned out to be a collection of inexpensive brand X items, many of which are not suited for this camera. Inquiring about two missing items, I was told that I didn't need them anyway. One was advertised as a Canon Wireless Remote, the only brand name in the kit. I never did get the items and after 4 months of trying, I gave up.

As an owner of this camera, I find them more informative than the manual itself, or lack there of. What troubles me most about this product is the difficulty to achieve good focus. Most often in dark, indoor settings, such as a dance floor at a wedding. I must convey that that I have far better luck with my 6 year old Olympus Camedia 3.2 pixel camera in these situations, on the automatic setting. I've had great success with this camera in daylight, particularly close-ups of plant life and wild life. Dark settings of people is really kicking my rear. So much so that I feel I've taken far better shots in these environments with a disposable camera back in the day. For instance, I can't seem to get an entire wedding party in focus at the church alter. I've tried the \"mountain/cloud\" setting without great results. Can't seem to adjust flash, ISO settings very well with that setting, or not at all. Even in good daylight environments, parts of the pictures are out of focus. And yes, I use a decent tripod (a Manfrotto whenever possible) to minimize shake. The manual says that if the camera beeps twice, and shows a green square in the view finder before you press the shutter button all the way down, then you're all good. In my experience, not so very often. I'm in no way saying I'm a pro photographer, but I'd sure like to learn how to be one. My profession is graphic design and I've dabbled in photography as a need-to-do-it basis. And I like it and I'm having fun doing it. But having to fix two thirds of my shots in post-shot applications (i.e. photoshop, et al) is kickin' my butt. In closing, I'd like to assure this audience that this is not necessarily a bad review of this product. More so, it is a call for help. Any suggestions from you folks would be greatly appreciated.

I had no idea what CMOS sensors or DSLR's were, and at $400.00 it was the most expensive camera I'd ever bought.  I figured for $400 it was bound to take great photographs, and I was really impressed with the wide angle to telephoto zoom it had... with the limited selection at the store this was the only real option I considered and I'm really glad it worked out that way.I took over 1000 photos with it over the next two days and quickly found myself becoming the \"hey could you take my photo and send it to me\" guy in the tour groups we traveled in.  Over the next 4 months I easily took over 5000 photos of pretty much everywhere I went.  I suddenly found myself carrying a camera all the time, and purchasing \"how to\" books about photography.  Every week it seemed like the camera became less of a \"point and shoot\" and more of a DSLR as I figured out feature after hidden feature that was on this thing.The more photos I took the more hooked I got to the hobby, and now 6 Months later I've upgraded to a Nikon D300 and a 24-70mm f/2.8 lens... somewhere around $3,500 worth of gear. Despite the awesomeness of that camera and lens, I still keep the Canon with me as a back up and I usually let my friends use it so they have something to do whenever I say \"hold on let me get a picture of this.\"  I'm finding that the camera is having the same effect on my friends as it had on me, and several of them have either purchased this same camera or they've taken the plunge into the DSLR world and picked up Nikon D90s or Canon 40/50Ds.My point? This is an AWESOME camera that caters to pretty much anyone that's only carried around those little cell-phone sized point-and-shoots or disposables and they now want to try out something a little bit better.

A high zoom camera seemed to fit the bill - I didn't have the time, nor inclination, to learn all the ins & outs of a true DSLR, but I wanted to have a few more options in a basic point & shoot with a good zoom for taking close up shots of my little guy.  I did considerable research, and was impressed with all 300+ reviews for the Canon Powershot SX10IS on Amazon.  I also read (& re-read) reviews from some well-respected digital photography websites, many of which gave this camera their highest ratings.  After hemming & hawing for some time, I bit the bullet & eagerly awaited the fabulous pictures that this Canon would produce.  I knew it was possible; I'd seen the examples on Amazon - all 500+.The evening that my purchase arrived, I took my time, reviewing the manual (rare for me as I tend to do first, then read) & learning about my new camera.  Then a test drive.  Disappointment followed. Almost nothing I did - not putting the IS on continuous, not raising the ISO, not tweaking the aperture or the shutter speed, nothing short of using the flash - seemed to fully eliminate camera shake.  But, I thought, it's nighttime & I'm indoors.  Tomorrow I'll try again.I awoke to a beautiful sun-washed morning, grabbed the camera, & started shooting pics of my 18 month old son playing in natural light.  Same problems.  I get it, taking indoor pictures means making some compromises.  Either a little on the dark side or maybe a little more noise; things which can mostly be cleaned up by editing.  But the quality of these pictures was horrible.  The camera was constantly registering camera shake unless the flash was up - even in clear, beautiful, morning sun.  Crushed.I had some reasonable good luck when taking shots outside, but nothing that seemed to warrant the high praise written of this camera.  My 6 year old Sony Cybershot, with only 4mp & 6x zoom, has given me reliably excellent photos even in the dimmest of light, something I would think this newer technology could easily provide.

The main reason I bought this model is because I'm an old SLR person and I use the viewfinder primarily.  With digicams that have LCD screens only (no viewfinder) be ready to spend big bucks for alkaline batteries or buy rechargeables which you'll probably be charging constantly. With some digicams that have an EVF (Electronic View Finder) plus an LCD screen you may have to switch between the EVF and the battery-draining LCD screen when you turn it on.  With the SX10 IS as well as similar Canon models, you don't have to use the LCD screen until you need it, saving your battery power.

You won't be able to get your regular photo settings back once you've set up the SX10 IS for Movie mode.I've had this camera since it first came out and it performed heroically with all my still photo needs. I'm a researcher, so I need to photograph many documents and naturally, there is no point in shooting black-and-white documents in color. With this camera I could even get beautifully legible images from documents on microfilm.No problems whatsoever--until a granddaughter had the lead role in a school play. So I set up the Movie shooting mode for the conditions that I knew I'd have to cope with. As it happens, I wasn't able to attend and didn't actually shoot even one second of the play. But now, in EVERY shooting mode, the camera essentially defaults to Movie mode for all settings. No more black and white; no center-point zoom to see if a document is legible.The manual says \"In modes other than Movie mode, some of the settings previously set in menus such as the FUNCT and REC. menus may be changed to those of the movie recording mode.\" What it DOESN'T tell you is that once that happens, YOU CAN'T CHANGE THEM BACK TO WHAT YOU HAD BEFORE! I took the thing to Samy's Camera--a large and very expert company--and they couldn't get the old settings back either. Canon wasn't much help either. They led me through the process which was supposed to restore everything to the default settings. It didn't work. The camera now insists on all settings in all modes being compatible with Movie mode.This makes the camera useless for my purposes.Pity. This was a great camera until it got set for Movie mode. Now I'm going to have to shop for a replacement. If you want to shoot both movies and still photos, get a separate camera for each purpose.

I haven't had a lot of time to test the camera out, but one thing that I have found that I really am disappointed with is the new video format.  The old AVI format is much more compatible with my programs then the new MOV format.  Also, the SX10 only offers two video qualities, both at 30 fps.  The S3 offered 5 different video capture settings.  I made full use of the video mode on my S3, so I was really upset to see the changes.  The 20X optical is really nice, unless you need more zoom, because you are not able to attach a telephoto lens.  I have a telephoto lens that attaches to my S3 which really gives me the extra zoom that I wanted (about 36X optical), however it needs a lot of light to produce good pictures and takes up a lot of room in my camera case.  The SX10 does have threads that accept a 52mm UV filter or polarized filter, even though canon won't admit it.  It is bigger and heavier than the S3, but not enough to cause problems.  Both the S3 and the SX10 auto modes are a let down in low light conditions, however for the amateur wildlife photographer the auto modes will allow you to quickly take good quality pictures without any adjustment from the user.  In low light conditions a tripod and manual camera adjustment are a must to get good pictures.Conclusion: For the $$$ it appears to be a good buy for 20X 10MP camera.  I would have liked to see the same video settings as the S3, especially the lower resolution 60 fps option and the cameras auto focus doesn't do as well at full zoom as expected.  Maybe I should have waited for the SX1 to get down to a reasonable price, or just purchased the S5IS.", "Date": "March 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Highly recomended", "Author": "Teapot \"Verin68\"", "ReviewID": "R2HD9Z2ABZFG1T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think this is an Excellent camera y highly recomend it.

They share the SLR-like package, most of the same features, with the K-M coming out ahead on things like f-11 instead of f-8, RAW processing (missing on the Canon), a threaded lens barrel so one has the option of using filters, and most importantly, a mechanical SLR-like focus ring.So I've been looking around for an \"upgrade,\" since cameras do usually get better over the years.  This Canon was attractive because of Canon's reputation and of course, the 28-560 lens (as opposed to 28-200 on the K-M), and the bigger articulated monitor.  But the rest of it had to shine, too, to get me to trade off the obvious benefits of the K-M.So I became the owner of a Canon SX10-IS.  OK, one more reason for the trial venture into this camera is that I also have a Canon G10, an amazing photographic instrument.  What I was hoping for, seeing that they're both Canon cameras, was that the SX would embody at least a semblance of the build quality and functionality of the G10.Not happening.  I immediately took some lots of photos at various settings and they were mostly very good. But the first turn-off was that much maligned control wheel.  On the G10, it is a precise control, with precise detents at every function change. Silly me, I figured that they would use the same one on the SX. On the SX, the wheel is sloppy and has no detents at all.  You turn the wheel and sometimes whatever function you are working in will change values, sometimes not.  But always it changes the values arbitrarily and not to what you want. A little past or a little short, but rarely right on.  I do a lot of HDR work and need to take 12-15 shots on a tripod, at 1-EV intervals.  Not with this thing, unless you have the patience to play around with it at each interval, working it back and forth between every two shots until finally you get close.  And then if you touch it a bit to hard you will press it in (it is also the four-way controller) and change some other major setting.  Enormously frustrating.  I'm pretty dextrous and have had lots of experience with many cameras and I love the same feature on the G10, but I have never seen a camera control this bad.  Not even on a $69 pocket camera.If my old K-M feels like a solid camera and the G10 feels like a precision instrument, the SX feels like some kid's cheap video game controller. The various buttons are not well defined, loose in their mounts, the electric zoom is like most cheap cameras where it zooms past where you want it and you have to toggle it back and forth to get it right. The flip-out monitor does not go out far enough to make it parallel to the back of the camera, where I need it to be for a lot of my work (and it is on any other camera I've used with an articulating monitor).Anyway, my impression of this camera during my three-days of owning is were that it is a highly overrated consumer product that is viable only to those who will give up a lot for a long telephoto lens.  It didn't expect it to compare in overall quality to the more expensive G10, but I was hoping it would be close, and in an SLR-like package that is more comfortable for me to handle than the boxy little G10.  They got the SLR-like package down, but that's about it.  Then the newer versions, the SX20 and 30 are getting worse across-the-board reviews, with the pros claiming that Canon is indeed playing games with consumers by touting more MPs and a longer lens, but in a camera whose image quality has actually deteriorated.  Shame on you, Canon, for using your fine reputation to con the masses.Too bad.  I was all excited about that long lens, too. But I'm still looking for a better camera than my little K-M A200.

The S3 IS was a great camera and I really enjoyed it - that is I *liked* using it.  I enjoyed taking pictures with it.  It was a great camera.Then I sold it to a friend and \"upgraded\" to this SX10 IS.  Frankly, I generally regret parting with my venerable S3 IS.In comparison:*  The S3 IS was smaller.  Physically, if you measure, the ruler says that the SX10 is not that much bigger -- but the feel of the SX10 is heavy and clunky.*  The controls of the S3 were much easier to manipulate by touch (i.e. I'm looking thought the eye-piece and changing settings by feel) -- this SX10 seems much more difficult to do the same thing, I and find I have to look at the controls more.*  The lens cap on the S3 IS was tethered - attached - and I could flip it off with the flick of one finger and know I'm not going to lose.  Whereas, the lens cap of the SX10 is NOT tethered and attaches differently making it hugely inconvenient for the \"quick-shot\" you might try to capture.  In my experience, more often than not, the lens cap falls off as I'm taking the camera out of my camera bag and is prone to fly off and get lost.  VERY annoying.  My intension is to attach a thin string somehow.*  Frankly, I see almost NO difference in the Digic III processor in this SX10 than I did in the Digic II processor of the S3 IS.  IF the SX10 dropped fewer frames when snapping a pic during movie mode, that would be great - but I see no difference.There are many other small annoyances between the S3 and the SX10 that I won't belabor here.On the plus side, I will admit that the 20x Zoom is nice.Summary:IF you are contemplating upgrading from an S3 IS or an S5 IS, my advice is to give this one a pass and keep your current camera UNLESS you really want the 20x zoom.", "Date": "December 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "Holly A.

Lots of chargers and inexpensive backups are always available.Upon close scrutiny of the many photo samples available thru online reviews, Canon's seemed the sharpest to me. There is a little purple fringing on contrast edges, but same with most cameras.Overall, the camera is quite a bargain for the solid build and features.All that is good and would rate 5 stars, but this camera is a little frustrating in daily use. The exposure compensation is fussy to activate... the little selection wheel has no feedback feel and WILL cause you to use curse words more than once. Also, the controls that come up first in the function setting menus are organized badly.

By the way, the video button, which is easy to get to, is in fact awkward to use and I find I have to push down.

Now adays with all this new technology, Canon couldn't come up with a small battery that holds a decent charge! I know the Sony T500 has poor battery life, but at least the camera is small - you would expect that! Who wants to schlep around 4 extra \"AA\" batteries - not me! This one was my fault, I did not ever read about the batteries before I bought the camera, but like above, if the Video was better, I could look the other way.3) Video: This was pretty important to me (again check out the T500). What is up with only the small video format when EVERY other camera company is opting for new 16:9 widescreen format? Again, my old G7 takes just as good \"small\" video and I can play/edit it with anything! Actually, the video from the SX10 is not all that good, except the fact that you can zoom all the way in (actually that is pretty cool), but not worth keeping it. I was hoping that even though the SX10 was not widescreen 720/1080, it would take decent \"HD like\" video with the new .MOV video format. Why Canon did not bring the SX1 out first I'll never know; because then if the videos were good - I might have kept the Canon. As many other reviewers have mentioned, I just don't understand these companies or their marketing plan. If they need any help, all they have to do is ask a few geeks like me - I'll tell em' an ear full!So all in all, I'm keeping the Sony T500 - even if the pictures are not quite as sharp. That little camera is all I need - \"right now\"!

My hobby is creating \"slideshows with music\", and I've done many of them. So, I had planned to use not only photos in the slideshow, but also some \"video\" also, just to have the slideshow flow with  a bit more variety.I'd also like to add that I\"m stricly a Canon person. Yes, I'm sure there are other super cameras out there, but I know and understand Canon cameras,so, I\"ll just stick with them.What I find a bit strange here is that since I'm a Canon person, why did I rate it only One (1) star?...Each Canon camera I've had in the past I've loved!.  Here was the problem:  The \"Wheel\" on this camera simply didn't turn well at all. It would \"hesitate\" and move just when it felt like.

My very first Canon camera was the S330 Elph, some eight years ago, and right from the box, it took me no time to set it up!. And so were all the other Canons that easy also..And, the Audio on this camera's supposed to have great stereo audio? When I played back the movie that I had taken with it, the audio sounded pretty bad to my ear.[...] I've purchased other cameras from them in the past, and have never returned anything to them, buy even though their delivery was super fast, I got the camera in 48 hours. But, you can be sure I'll not be buying another camera from them simply because of their restocking charge.To be fair, after I had rated this camera a One (1) star, I realized that I had rated it incorrectly. When I then went to rate it for Three (3) stars, the Amazon interface or whatever, would not allow me to change the one star to a three star.I'm sure that this camera will be just right for many people and my dilemma with it will most probably not be similar to others who have this camera or are going to buy it.", "Date": "October 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "sorry i bought it", "Author": "Mrs. Jane Schweiger", "ReviewID": "R1XAR08H77NEAP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "CANON POWERSHOT SX101S 10MP DIGITAL CAMERA  PHOTOS ARE GREAT, ZOOM IS GREAT BUT THE LENS CAP IS NOT ATTACHED AND IS TOO FLIMSY TO ATTACH WELL.
