This seems to be one of the cheapest tools to use for HDR photography. This camera has much to like, and I am happy with my purchase, but I want to warn potential purchasers of the problems:The battery. You must use Fuji rechargeable battery, rather than 2 high-power disposable AAs. It does not charge via USB cable to the camera. This is one of the most inane design flaws that I can imagine. The enclosed wall-wart battery charger is larger than the camera and is only for North American outlets. So now instead of packing the camera and a USB cable, I pack a camera, a USB cable and this wallwart and it may take up a spot on my international power converter. Inconvenient, and much worse to use than I thought it'd be.Folks will have to remember to release the flash, and people with large hands will have to take care to not block the sensors in how they hold the camera.one other minor complaint is that the SD card is in the same chamber as the battery (bottom of camera), it is a bit less accessible than being in the side chamber.Again, a pretty good device, but I wanted people to know about the stupid battery situation.", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good value", "Author": "BajaInsider", "ReviewID": "RZXOIYRFU526X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A very good little camera. Huge and bright LCD so you can actually see something when shooting with the sun behind you (the preferred location of the sun in a photo) Like the pop up flash. Bought it for the $199 underwater housing, which hasn't arrived yet. The video at high rez seems to transfer fast enough. I have an older (10Mp) Fuji XP model and it starts to drop frames after the internal memory is full (about 7 seconds at high rex. 15 at 640x400) ((Yes, I was using a class 10 chip)) But this camera seems to have resolved that issue with the EXR processor. I haven't had any drop outsBIG POINT -  DOES NOT HAVE CONTINUOUS FOCUS in video zoom, so you can not zoom while shooting video. I am also still a little disappointed in Fuji's auto focus. I still get a few 'fuzzygraphs' from time to time, particularly in lower light (not a shutter speed problem, an auto focus problem)I am a retired pro-shooter, so I am pretty critical of cameras. My first pro camera was a Fuji FX600 35 years ago. I used only Fujion 4x5 lenses in my studio (I owned every focal length they made) and the Fuji glass is still worthy of note, great color, low flair, lots of features I will probably never use. A neat one is the 360\u00b0 panorama feature. I might recommend the 700 series EXR's as they have a 20X zoom vs this 15X. I don't even know IF this camera has a digital zoom. I consider digital zoom a waste of time, I can crop into a photo myself far better in Photoshop.It would make an excellent camera for land based shooters. If there is any chance you might get it wet in sports or play, get one of the Fuji XP series good to 5 meters. I believe this came from Audorama. also where I purchased my first Fuji three decades ago, always providing great values.Shoot on!", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!!", "Author": "always2happy", "ReviewID": "R1ZGSOSGJUXR2E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera because of the great pictures it takes!
