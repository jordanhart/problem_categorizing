{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not a starter kit for the EOS Rebel T3i; save your money.", "Author": "Xiong Mao", "ReviewID": "RRWAGG6VR382O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Buyer beware! This item is advertised as an EOS Rebel T3i Starter Kit, but it's far from it.Cons:- The camera bag is actually too small to fit my T3i, and way too flimsy.- The smallest tripod is for a COMPACT digital camera, it WONT support the t3i properly.- The \"large\" tripod is only 50 inches, and this page doesn't list the measurements.- Only the cleaning and screen items can be considered part of a DSLR starter kit.- Even if this were advertised for compact digital cameras, the bag would be too big.- The seller seems dishonest; I ordered a brand new product from the only seller of this kit. Unfortunately, the item arrived with dirt stains everywhere. It's clearly a used product that was sent back by another unhappy customer.It is, however, a decent compact digital camera starter kit. This kit should not be considered for any kind of DSLR, as too many items are useless! If you want a kit for a compact digital camera, then this will be more than sufficient. Otherwise, go with something else; this kit isn't worth it.Do yourself a favor if you want a DSLR kit: research and assemble it yourself. You should get a better bag than this because protecting your investment is of utmost importance. You can get either the Canon Deluxe Gadget Bag 100EG or Canon 2400 SLR Gadget Bag for EOS SLR Cameras, as they're both excellent for a Canon EOS camera.UPDATE: I decided to keep this package because others in my household could use the rest of the items for their compact digital cameras. However, upon opening the package with the memory card, I found several things of concern: dust, mold, spider webs, and dog hair. I am very disappointed with this seller (you may think this doesn't have anything to do with the seller, but there's only ONE seller selling this particular kit). Do yourself a favor and stay away from this kit.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004RCLPOW"}}
