Juges \"Shopper extrordinare\"", "ReviewID": "RPYX7M1RCCQT4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my then 8 year old neice for Christmas last year.  It was the least expensive \"adult\" digital camera I found that also had many supposed features.  She was so excited when she opened it Christmas morning, and didn't even finish opening the rest of her gifts.  Once it was all set up the festive Chrismas mood in the house quickly went south.  EVERY picture she took was dark and blurry to the point that you couldn't make out a persons face.  This \"digital\" camera is advertised as 7.1MP's, having an anti shake setting, but DO NOT waste your money on this camera, please, you will regret it!!! I compare the picture quality to a kids camera, maybe even worse.  I can't believe that people are even buying this camera for the price asked!!!", "Date": "November 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Low quality pictures", "Author": "Bent Lady", "ReviewID": "R1RSOTXD38RMOX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The pictures I've taken with this camera are similar quality to ones I have taken with a 1.3 MP cell fone camera.  Your best shot at taking a halfway decent picture with this thing is to have your subject to stand outside in the bright daylight, and use the delay setting (takes the picture either 2 or 10 seconds after you press the button).  Even then, you will probably have to take three pictures of the same person in the same pose to get it to come out with no blurs, or weird distribution of light in the picture.I've tried all the different settings.  Just a crappy camera.If you do not need any better quality than you could get from the cheapest cell fone camera you ever had, then this camera will do.  But you will have to fool with it more than a cheapie cell fone camera to get a picture that doesn't look like it was on Ghost Hunters.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good as a first combined mp3,digital camera, note reader etc.", "Author": "K.

BUT it is a perfect \"My First\" for a young kid who wants to have a cool gadget that works in terms of combining mp3 player w basic functions and good sound, a simple text reader to store and read notes, a camera with functions neither too many nor too few, and EXTREMELY easy to move files on and off using your PC.It is surprisingly versatile given its price and ease of use", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Big Time Case Of Digital Photography Caveat Emptor!", "Author": "Andre S. Grindle \"Andre' Grindle\"", "ReviewID": "RLCMTZ90XI8Z4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Even though I've had my professional Olympus Evolt E500 8MP Digital SLR with 14-45mm f/3.5-5.6 & 40-150mm f/3.5-4.5 Zuiko Lenses for several years now I decided it was time to have a smaller but high quality digital camera for casual use. I didn't want to spend the outrageous prices on some of the fancier models;just wanted something smaller but comparable because my professional SLR is an 8MP anyway so that was'nt even a concern. This camera was inexpensive,I was allowed to demonstrate it in the store and even told I could bring it back in the event that,once the photos were downloaded into my PC it didn't meet the basic quality needs. So for those looking for an inexpensive digital camera I am going to give you the facts and only the facts on this camera. It's really the only way to go in this situation. First the pros. This camera takes three AAA batteries and take optimum advantage of battery life. It has a number os sophisticated settings such as picture size,a number of exposure options including compensation AND a superior set of lighting options. There's also controls for image quality and ISO settings. The actual image quality is where I have to go into the cons,especially when it comes transfering to your PC. What appears on the screen as your composing is a very blurry and foggy image. And when you transfer the image to your PC and open it up with whatever system your operating with....the image you'll is very low in terms of sharpness on the same end. In my personal case I cleaned the lens of with my other cameras lens cloth beforehand and that's still what was produced-a very poor image. Although the camera is 7.1MP the image quality,even at the highest quality settings which I had it on were grainier and low quality than the extremely poor images from my first digital camera Aiptek DV4500 4MP MPEG4 Pocket Digital Camcorder which at least was lacking in the foggy aspect of the image this one has. Also it should be noted that the shutter response time,especially when the flash is activated is very slow and will result in even more blurred pictures if you don't keep the camera totally still and focused on your subject for less then 5-10 seconds. All in all the pictures taken with this are the equivilant of what you might've gotton on a camera phone image about four or five years ago-closer at the very best settings to a 3MP quality than a 7.1MP one. So if you want very general images without any aspect of even fair looking pictures this will probably do just fine. It does have a good wealth of features. If your a person looking to take good quality pictures to share online through email or even on Facebook the images this camera will provide just don't cut the mustard in that respect.", "Date": "June 6, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "7.1 Megapixel Digital Camera\nColor 2.4-Inch Tft Monitor To Preview Photos\n4X Digital Zoom\nShoots Video Clips\nAnti-Shake Helps Avoid Blurry Photos", "Name": "DIGITAL CONCEPTS 87690 7.1 Megapixel Digital Still Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41cM-6x1nML._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0017I91JU"}}
