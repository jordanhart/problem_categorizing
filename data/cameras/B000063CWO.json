{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good choice for beginners or web-based digital photography", "Author": "m_s_", "ReviewID": "R1NQO9I3VF3DR0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a working photographer, and Olympus has always had a good reputation among my fellow professionals for making high-quality, inexpensive point-and-shoot film cameras. I've known many folks who packed an Olympus Stylus in their pocket, in addition to their regular high-end camera gear, for quick grab shots and the like. It seems that for the most part, this high regard can be extended to Olympus's digital point-and-shoot cameras as well.I'm planning some extended travels, and though I'll be using my film cameras for the majority of my photography, I also wanted to bring an inexpensive digital camera to email a few snapshots back home. I previously had used several other Olympus digital cameras, including the D-380, and had been pleased with all of them, so when I found a D-520 at a reasonable price I jumped on it.And after a few weeks of general use, I'm happy with the performance of the D-520. Colors are rendered with good saturation and accuracy, especially in sunlight, and the images are sharper and clearer than I expected for a digital camera at this price, particularly at the higher resolutions. The various controls are fairly intuitive once you get used to them, and while I wish there were a few more manual options, there's a good set of control choices for an entry-level camera. Plus it's small - even smaller than the D-380, which doesn't have a zoom lens. It fits easily into my pants pocket or shirt pocket, which is great for travelling.The downsides, though there are a few, are mostly minor. The flash pops out and sits there in a bit of an awkward spot, and there's no way to put it back in its slot while the camera's on, even if you've turned the flash off. Frankly, I can't see any good reason why they didn't just leave it embedded in the camera body like they did on most of this camera's cousins. The rubber flap over the USB and video ports seems a bit fiddly and prone to breaking off, but that's not a big deal to me. And the flash sometimes takes a while to charge up again after a photo, but since it runs off just 2 AA batteries I guess that was the trade-off Olympus made for smaller size and weight.It's not a perfect camera, but it's probably one of the better options available in this price range. The Olympus D-520 is a good camera for a beginner, or for someone who won't miss having full manual controls and other creative options in their camera. Its 2-megapixel resolution is well more than adequate for email and the web (which is how I plan to use it) or for 4x6-size snapshots. Those who demand more control and more options, or who plan to print out 5x7, 8x10, or larger enlargements might want to seek out a model with higher resolution.If you do get this camera, drop the extra $50 or so and spring for an accessory 128mb smartmedia card. The included 16mb card is too small for anything but short photo excursions, while the 128mb card will give you all the space you'll ever need - on the D-520 it holds well over 250 pictures, even at high resolution. You could save a few bucks and get a 64mb card instead, but in my opinion the extra cost is more than worth it to get twice as much storage space in return.", "Date": "October 29, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great camera, great buy!!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3TORBTF7E2UUC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd say I was pretty lucky to have found out about this Olympus D-520, which replaces the popular D-510. For about the same price, you'll get more with D-520. It's smaller and lighter. It comes with 16 MB card (instead of 8 MB card that comes with D-510). And, it only uses 2 AA batteries instead of 4, so you don't have to charge them too often (assuming you're using rechargeable batteries, because it's a MUST for digital cameras). The pop-up flash design is a little bit better in D-520, however, I wish that it pops down everytime the lens barrier is closed. The LCD screen is reduced to 1.5\", but it doesn't really bother me, as long as the pictures are there :). The menu is easy to use, and the pictures are great. It's my first digital camera, and so far I'm really pleased with its performance.

I use it for sending photos on the web.  It's great for that.2.  After lots of research, this is the best I could find for under [money].  Super buy.3.  You need a USB port on your computer.4.  Easy easy easy to use.  If you have Windows XP on your computer, you plug the USB adaptor into the camera. XP recognizes the camera as a drive.  (No software to install).  You simply drag and drop the jpegs to your hard drive same as you would any files from any disk or drive.  When you unplug the USB, the camera turns off.  This probably works on Win98 as well, but you might want to check that out ahead of time.5.  Battery life is unmatched.  I have used it all day (in the viewfinder mode) without seeing the battery power indicator move at all.6.  Sixe 4 1/2  X 2 1/2 inches.7.  Even close, the viewfinder does an excellent job of properly centering the photo.  This saves battery life.  You don't have to turn the screen on unless you want it.8.  Downfalls:  You close the sliding lens cap to turn the camera off.  If you push it too hard, the lens caps hits the lens and causes the pull-in-the-lens mechanism to jam.  Can't review your photos on the rear screen unless you first turn the camera off.  Pretty annoying if you want to show your shot to someone immediately.9.  Other things you will need. Get a cheap (non Olympus) NiCd batter charger.  I found an Eveready set for [money].  It's much cheaper than the Olympus and works as well.  Get a SmartMedia 128MB card to replace the one in the camera.  You will have trouble filling it up before you download.  ...  You may want a vinyl case.  It's not included.10.  Lots of other features I have never found the need to use, but they give a lot of added capability and depth to the camera.11.  Finally, the pop up flash does a great job with fill in ... like when you are taking a photo of people with a window behind them.  The center weighted metering is not very good, so you will have to select flash instead of automatic.", "Date": "September 16, 2002"}, {"Title": "A perfect match between features and price!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3HT5LU0DX7BXS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing extensive research both online and in stores (where you can actually hold the cameras), I decided that the Olympus D-520 was a great blend between features and price. Unless you're a pro photographer, you're not going to need more than 2 megapixel detail. I don't even use the highest setting, so I can store more pics on my memory card and computer. The camera has so many options, it's awesome. Read the manual for all the details.Having used an older Olympus 1.3 mp model, I knew what I wanted in my OWN camera. The 3x optical zoom is, IMHO, essential. Taking big pictures and cropping doesn't make up for being able to zoom in. A store salesperson said that zoom lenses have to be of a higher optical quality than normal ones too. I wanted a small, lightweight package, which this definitely is. It only takes 2 AA batteries, and it's a lot smaller than previous models and those ones with the big 10x lenses. It takes Quicktime movies (in 15\" or 1 minute segments, depending on resolution), but they don't have sound, so it's pretty useless, in my opinion.Recommended accessories (in no order):  1. NIMH batteries (I got a set of 4 with a rapid charger)  2. Extra memory card (I already had a 64 Mb card, but it goes up to 128 on this camera.)  3. Carrying case (Bring your purchased camera, batteries, and memory card to a bunch of stores until you find one that fits well. I got a Tamarac that fits like a glove!)  4. USB Smart Media card reader (If you won't be using rechargeable batteries. If so, the included cable is just as fast and more compact for travel.)If you plan on doing serious editing, the included Camedia software probably won't cut it, but it works fine for the casual user who just wants to view and edit pics.I hope this helps your purchasing decision. It's an awesome camera!", "Date": "July 20, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great camera, great price", "Author": "Eric R. Pedersen \"erictred99\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZPVS6MHU1BCS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a good digital camera at a reasonable price.  The D-520 definitely fits the bill.  I wanted to make sure the camera I bought had enough features to keep me happy, but wasn't so complicated that my wife wouldn't use it.  This camera seems to fit the bill.  She can power it up and shoot away without worrying about changing any settings.  I like the 3X optical zoom, it gives you lots of options for framing a shot as you take it without losing resolution like you would cropping the picture later in your computer.  All of the pictures I have taken so far look great.The only down side to this camera keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the Camedia Master software that comes with it.  It doesn't allow you to do much but download pictures off the camera and put them in albums.  My biggest beef is that it appears that you can't change where the software stores it albums.  You can upgrade to the \"pro\" version of the software, which adds some nice features like being able to rename groups of pictures to one name root with a numbered extension ...Thankfully, the ability to drag and drop the pictures from the camera (it shows up as a removable drive on your PC) offsets this drawback.I would highly recommend this camera.  As with all digital cameras, you should invest in some good nickel metal hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries and a good charger.  You may want to carry some spare charged batteries as well.  I also recommend getting more smart media cards as the included card is only 16 MB.  Some people recommend 128 MB, but since I don't like putting all my eggs in one basket (what if that card gets damaged or lost?) I recommend getting two 64 MB cards.  The price difference isn't that much, and you have a backup card in case on gets damaged.", "Date": "November 4, 2002"}, {"Title": "Quite good.", "Author": "Rheumor", "ReviewID": "RSAC6AJRLG5Z2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The D-520 is another of the Olympus line of clam shell cameras dating back to the old (non-digital) Stylus models of the mid-80s. In that sense, the design is tried and true and I like it for its compactness and its ability to protect the lens from those with a penchant for losing lens caps. For the vast majority of digital camera users, this camera will meet all of their needs well into the future. The D-520 offers adequate resolution at 2 megapixels. As I have stated in numerous reviews of other digicams, resolution much beyond 2 megapixels is worse than useless for *most* applications, it is costly. It not only costs money in the sense that it raises the initial price of the camera, but operationally, it requires greater battery use, usually involves longer lag times between shots, takes much longer to download to a PC and especially prolongs both phases of e-mailing photos (your uploading the file and your recipient opening it). These latter issues are, in my opinion, the most important, as the real purpose of digital cameras is their neat integration into the world of personal computing. [note: For those folks whose needs are enlarging photos beyond 8\" x 10\", higher resolution is required] The other features of the D-520 worth noting are its very adequate 3X optical zoom *plus* a vaguely helpful 2.5X digizoom (do not accept digital zooms in place of optical zooms; they are not equals), its ability to operate off readily available AA alkalines (though it will accept rechargeables and these make more sense in may ways), its easily expandable memory (it uses SmartMedia, not quite as good as CompactFlash cards, but close enough) and an adequate number of user-controllable settings, all of which can be handled automatically if you prefer. The only drawback of significance has been slow focus on the Olympus digital cams, resulting in more blurred pics than I think acceptable (and this even with my 700, self-stabilizing model!). Anyway, at the current price, which is about half what it would have been 18 months ago, this is a good camera and a good deal, though for even money, I'd take the Canon A20.", "Date": "June 1, 2002"}, {"Title": "Problems with D-520 ZOOM:  Out-of-focus viewfinders", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "R3VCCMDHGTUNIA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After comparing features of many similar cameras in the same general category, I selected the D-520 ZOOM. I immediately noticed that the viewfinder was out of focus, but initially, I assumed that it was my own eyesight, or a smudge on the lens, or that there was a focus adjustment I hadn't found, so I used the camera for about a week before deciding to return it for an exchange.When I went to exchange it, we discovered that all five additional cameras in stock also had out-of-focus viewfinders !  It was verified by the store's sales people.So i simply got a refund.I like the features of the D-520, and the digital version of the pictures always turned out well; but it was just too irritating to be looking at a blurry image through the viewfinder when trying to frame the shots. How difficult can it be for a camera design to make sure the viewfinder focuses properly ?.....especially a company of Olympus' reputation !  That is why i wasn't more critical of the flaw when I first noticed it.The sales manager said he was contacting Olympus and returning all his defective stock.  So I will probably just wait and see if Olympus solves this quality control problem and perhaps buy another D-520 unless I find something I like better in the interim.  If you are thinking of a D-520, be certain to check the viewfinder very critically.  It is just irritating to have the subject always out-of-focus when taking pictures, even if the digital version comes out looking good.", "Date": "May 27, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great buy for the price", "Author": "Gayathri Radhakrishnan \"ga3\"", "ReviewID": "R37KUBMG1MZN62", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The olympus D-520 is a great buy for the price. I wanted to get away from the hassle of developing films at the same time I wanted a camera that was not too expensive.

The movie mode is nice to capture some insane moments.4. Downloading images is very easy with the drag & drop feature. (I have WIndows 98)5. You can view pictures right after taking them without having to power off the camera. (You need to press the monitor button twice and it goes to playback mode and then if you press the shutter halfway it reverts back to shooting mode)Cons:1. It looks a little cheap because of the plastic body.2. Opening and closing the shutter is not very convenient and especially while closing the shutter I am constantly afraid that I am going to break either the lens or the shutter.3. Though movie mode is a neat feature it captures only about 15sec and without sound.I am currently using regular alkaline batteries and though I have had no problems of battery consumption, I am planning to buy NIMH batteries and also additional memory (it comes with 16MB).

We also purchased a 128M SmartMedia card, which is almost a requirement for this camera, since 16M will run out really quick if you're taking high-resolution pictures!Picture quality is great, although red-eye is a bigger problem than it was with my previous, 35mm camera (though I haven't tried the red-eye reduction flash mode yet). The software that comes with the camera has a red-eye filter, but it doesn't look very good (imaging taking a black crayon to your picture, and you're not far off).I haven't noticed the focusing problems that some people have reported. The time between when you click the button and when the picture is taken isn't long, IF you first press it slightly to set the focus -- if you set the focus first, the actual picture is taken almost immediately. If not, there's about a two second delay before the picture is taken. This isn't that different than some 35mm cameras I've seen without a fixed focus -- it takes the camera a second to adjust the focus to where it should be before it snaps the picture.It does take several seconds to reset between pictures (much of that time appears to be the time it takes to write to the card -- switching to a lower-resolution format may change how long you have to wait between pictures). Fresh batteries seem to help minimize this delay -- get four high-capacity (1800 mAh) NiMH rechargable batteries, and charge two while two are in the camera. Swap the pairs before you start getting any low battery indicators, to keep the pair in the camera fresh.You really need to read the manual with this one -- the controls aren't difficult, but some of them aren't intuitive (if you want to review the picture you just took while the lens cover is open, you have to \"double-click\" on the view button). It's easy to hand it to someone to just point-and-shoot a picture -- it's the more advanced features that aren't intuitive. Once you learn a couple shortcuts, it's not hard to use at all, but you won't be able to just pick this up and use the advanced features without reading the manual first. Many of the complaints I've seen in other Amazon.com reviews about things this camera can't do, it really CAN do -- you just need to know how.I really love the fact that once you set the time on the camera, all your pictures are stamped with the date/time that you took your picture (and even what the camera settings were at the time). This makes it a lot easier to sort through pictures later, or to remember how old someone is in the shot. This may be a standard feature of digital camera, but it's a nice one.Using this with Windows XP Professional was a snap -- just plug in the USB cable, let Windows recognize it, and copy the files to your hard drive. We had it a week before we installed the software that came with the camera, and even then we only use what's built into Windows. There's even a way to print sheets of pictures (a bunch of wallets, or several 3x5s, or a contact sheet with dozens of thumbnails) built right into the OS (the \"Windows Picture and Fax Viewer\").Overall, we've been very happy with this camera.

But you probably shouldn't be making movies on your camera anyway, since it's difficult to keep it steady, and using the LCD screen eats up batteries quickly. But it's fun, in case you want to put a mini-movie on your website.", "Date": "December 10, 2002"}, {"Title": "A Great Package!", "Author": "Paul Ramone", "ReviewID": "R3RPGZ7WLT5PGB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the D-520Z as my third digital camera. I have many years of photography experience, and have owned more than two dozen 35mm film cameras.This is a great camera for the person who is somewhat fussy, but still wants an easy-to-use optical zoom platform. For the benefit of people who don't read instructions, one may view a just-snapped picture by pressing the display button twice or (better yet) setting the camera up to display the picture for about 2 seconds after snapping it. Also, all settings can be memorized so the camera is ready to go as soon as you fire it up. For instance, I use fill flash on nearly every outdoor shot that involves people, and I have a preference for spot-metering. Both of these items are selectable and memorizable.Although the flash recycle time is a little slow, I consider it a very fair trade-off for being able to use AA batteries and only two of them at that.  Performance with NiMH batteries is outstanding; on a recent vacation I took over 100 pictures, most with flash, with extensive use of the LCD, and never changed batteries.Low-light performance is acceptable to me, and I take a lot of pics indoors.The camera is quite compact (fits easily in a shirt pocket with room to spare), and most important, the body is relatively thin.  Before you buy ANY camera, consider whether you really want to lug that clunky (and expensive) digital camera around for the sake of a possible tiny increase in picture quality.The true measure of any camera is picture quality, and I find this one to be very good.  I'm finicky, and I'm pleased.This camera is not as sexy-looking as some of the competition (read ELPF), but the price is right and I feel beginners and amateurs will be able to take a very high percentage of good pics with this one.

Okay, I'll admit that's not a real issue since the difference cannot be detected anyway but I'm just listing differences.

The quality of the pictures on the D520 is just amazing and high quality inkjet prints on photo glossy paper look like a photo.  It is very easy to operate, although I was not too sure how to close the camera the first time since I tried to do so without reading the manual.  However most of the commands and features are explicit and intuitive. My main criticism is the delay between the time you shoot the photo and the time the camera takes it.  It must be close to 1 second which is an eternity when you try to take the picture of a smiling baby or a live action.  More misses than hits, but eventually you learn to anticipate the smile and take the shot or multiple shots, which you can erase easily afterwards.  I have heard similar complaints from owners of other cameras of different brands, so this is not a problem specific to the D520. The only other big surprise was how much battery this camera can eat!

(and I buy Olympus batteries) If you're at a graduation or other event you basically have one chance to get a picture because your child will be off the stage and back to their seat before the flash recycles and you can take another picture.

I was looking for a good digicam to replace my Fujifilm FinePix A101, which was and still is a great litte camera, but lacked an optical zoom and was a mere 1.3 megapixels.  After a trip to England with the A101, I decided to get a higher end point and shoot camera with optical zoom and higher resolution.  Having done a bit of research, I settled on the Olympus D-520, which had just come down in price.  I had owned an Olympus 35mm camera which lasted me for several years and was FANTASTIC, so I thought I'd be getting the same level of quality in the digicam.  Boy was I disapointed!The first thing that bothered me was the sound of the gears almost straining when the clamshell is pulled back and the lens protracts.  I was a bit worried that something was wrong with it, but it turns out that that's how all the D-520's sound when they're turned on or off.  My 35mm Olympus had a similar clamshell front, but the sound of it opening and closing was extremely quiet.  It also had a metal body, whereas the D-520 has a plastic case.  I think Olympus was looking to skimp in the design and engineering deptartments with the D-520!The next problem I encountered was how fickle it was when taking photos.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that I miss about 75% of photo oportunities when I use this camera.  The lag between photos feels like eons, especially since speedy recouperation is essential for point and shoot cameras.  The D-520 is EXTREMELY picky about when and where it wants to take pictures... If light levels are not perfect, or if you're too close or too far away from the object you're trying to capture, IT WILL NOT TAKE THE PICTURE.  Period.  Once again, you're talking a lot of missed photo ops and impatient people posing for a camera that refuses to take a picture.This camera does well on auto-timer mode, though.  Sometimes it's the only way I can get it to take a picture, unfortunately.  It offers a 12 second timer, which is a few seconds longer than most other cameras, and you typically end up with plenty of time to set it up and get situated.Nighttime or photos shot with minimal light don't look great.  They're not terrible, but they could be a whole lot better.  In low-lighting situations, the flash can really tweak the quality of the picture, so you have to be on your guard.  The nighttime flash option does well in low light situations, though it tends to illuminate everything in what looks like daylight.Resolution is passable.  2.3 megapixels is probably good enough for someone new to the digicam experience, but over time, it seemed as though the quality of the resolution was degrading.  Or maybe that was just my patience with the camera...Some people complain that this camera is not intuitive to use.  I'd say that that's probably the least of the problems with the D-520.  My 10 year old nephew was able to master the basic functions of this camera after a minute or two, so it's not that hard to figure out.  It's just not as obvious as some other cameras on the market.In closing, I really don't care for this camera.  I feel as though Olympus could have done a whole heck of a lot better, but it's made me very warry of ever purchasing another Olympus digicam.  Now that it's over a year old, the D-520 is quite affordable, but I'd recommend going with a Fujifilm camera in the same price range, as I've always been very happy with my Fujifilm cameras.", "Date": "December 11, 2003"}, {"Title": "Extreme convenience, optical limitations", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R263VKNG4PTJZY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera.  I got it so that I could share photos over the internet and put them on my web site.  The camera has the limitations that most digital cameras have in the lower price range.  The main limitations I run into are:1)  There is significant chromatic aberration and haloing that appear in backlit images (e.g. trees against the sky).  In more flat scenes, this is not apparent.  This is a limit of the lenses used.2)  The macro doesn't let one get closer than 10 inches or so.3)  The f-stop and CCD sensitivity require the use of flash in settings that don't appear that dark, or one gets motion blur.The advantages I find:1)  It is small enough to slip in one's pocket.  A great advantage for field trips and walking around where you don't want a camera swinging from ones neck.2)  The flash is good for intimate indoor shots; exposures are well automated.3)  The slide over lens door gives great protection to the lens surface and gears.

The shift to spot metering, white adjustment, telephoto or wide angle, for example, are practically instantaneous.  Unless I am after a particular class of photos, I do not fix the setup, but prefer to adjust for each case.  The default settings are excellent for a wide variety of conditions in any case.  For a 2MB system, the quality (a range of qualities are actually available and are easy to select) is excellent.

The display doesn't come on when you turn the camera on - you have to turn it on yourself.  Of course, you don't need it on - you can never turn it on and shoot everything as if it was a normal camera - then just look at the pictures on your computer.  However most of us like to play with these a little more and show our friends pictures right after we take them.  This just makes it a little more difficult to do that.  This should not be a deal breaker though.I've had substantial trouble with indoor photography however.  If you think the flash issue that everyone talks about won't be an issue for you, think again.  You'll take this to one wedding and miss every shot you want.  On top of that, most of the pictures will come out dark and out of focus.  Basically indoor pictures are just out.  But outdoor, it works fine.The part I was happiest with was the software that came with it.  The program to download and edit your photos was oppositely extremely intuitive and easy to use.

Hoffman", "ReviewID": "R149B6RYI02BNN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been following Olympus's cameras since the D-360 and D-450 came out, and had been waiting for them to release one with a certain feature set.  I wanted 2 megapixels, USB, and a reasonable price.  The D-520 has that, and unlike its predecessor (the D-510) it is pretty compact and runs on only two AA batteries, not 4.Finally, receiving my tax refund, I decided to break down and buy a digital camera.  There were really three contenders in my mind:  The Fuji Finepix 2600Z, the Olympus D-520, and the Canon Digital IXUS 330.  A friend of mine highly recommended the Canon model, but its list price was [money], which was out of my price range (also, nobody had it in stock).  So for me it came down to the Fuji and the Olympus.  I ended up going with the Olympus because a local electronics retailer had it for [money].The camera itself is pretty simple to use.  It has four quality settings: 640x480 (sq1), 1024x768 (sq2), 1600x1200 low (hq), and 1600x1200 high (shq).  While some Olympus models I've used previously allow saving as a TIFF, with the D-520 all of the pictures are saved to the camera as JPEGs.  This is a shame, because it means you are stuck with the camera's JPEG quality level.  If they had allowed you to save as TIFF, you could easily set your own JPEG compression level in photoshop.That is part of the problem I have with this camera, and part of the reason I only gave it 3 stars.  The picture quality is not that great.  The camera seems to have an extremely difficult time focusing in low-light situations, even when the flash is used, and the pictures come out very blurry.  I played around with some of the settings, but I can't seem to fix this.  And even in bright sunlight, I find images taken with the camera not to be very sharp at all.  Also some colors seem to bleed: I took a picture of some flowers in direct sunlight and the picture came out as some pink and red blobs, losing all the detail of the flower.  I tried adjusting the white balance, but it didn't seem to help.The camera does take some nice pictures too, however.  Pictures of people come out very nice, and since I mostly take pictures of people (at family gatherings, etc), and not scenery, it's an OK camera for my needs.The USB connection is extremely handy, and in my opinion, the best way to access a digital camera's files.  My girlfriend's brother has a smartmedia floppy adapter, and that is extremely slow.  With the D-520, I simply plugged the USB into my computer, and my PC (running Windows 2000) recognized the camera as another hard drive.  I then simply copied the files over.  The camera comes with some software for editing pictures and stuff, but I haven't bothered to install it.  I don't believe that Windows 98 will allow you to simply plug in the camera and have it recognized as another hard drive, you probably have to install extra drivers.Battery life is OK; I have rechargable NiMH AA's, so it's not something I worry about too much.  The fact that it only takes 2 instead of 4 effectively doubles battery life over most cameras, in my mind at least.The included 16 MB Smart Media card can hold: 99 pictures at SQ1, 58 at SQ2 (my preferred size), 33 at HQ, and 11 at SHQ.All in all, it's a decent camera for the price, but don't expect perfection.", "Date": "June 9, 2002"}, {"Title": "Still excellent in quality", "Author": "Al mamun", "ReviewID": "R3F4UXXDYBH35S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Im mamun from Dhaka, Bangladesh.
