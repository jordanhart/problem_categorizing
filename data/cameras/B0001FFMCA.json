The main reasons for the purchase were:1) A \"Smiley Face\" mode  - The \"smiley face\" is the symbol on the camera to select full automatic exposure.  My parents want to take snapshots not worry about the exposure settings2) Ability to use a variety of batteries - the camera accepts a Lithium Ion rechargable battery pack, AA rechargable batteries and AA alkaline cells.  if they're traveling and don't have recharged batteries, then alkaline AA batteries can get them through in a pinch3) size / portability - it's a small camera - the length and width is about the size of a credit card and the depth is about an inch or so.  It's more compact than the Canon Elph series or Nikon Coolpix.  If the camera is too bulky, the won't carry it and use it.4) Price - even though it is a 4 Megapixel camera, it is priced in line with the 3 megapixel offerings from Canon, Nikon and Minolta.  I bought it from Costco for $279 and that included the Li On recharger, a 64Megabyte SD card, and several rechargeable batteriesI had the opportunity to try it out with my parents to make sure that it worked and ensure they could use it.  Here's what we found:Picture Quality - Picture quality is good for snapshots, it's a little soft relative to other 4 megapixel offerings, but certainly better than 3 megapixels.  The color balance is good and the pictures are sharp.  We had the pictures printed at Walgreens and one could not tell that it was from a digital cameraFlash performance - the flash is a typical flash for a compact camera - not great, but usable.  It has a range of about 10 -12 feetCycle time - the camera is not the fastest - it takes a few seconds to cycle up and down between shots.  It is about the same as many of the other digital cameras I have used.  I think Canon SD 110 and Minolta Xg are definitely quickerProgram Modes - The \"Smiley Face\" mode does a great job of exposure settings. It truly is set and forgetBattery performance - we got about 25 shots on a set of AA alkaline batteries, using flash for all pictures and using the LCD as a viewfinderConstruction - the stainless steel housing feels solid and makes it easy to hold withuot shaking the cameraIn general, the camera is great for the price.  It is not as good as other 4 megapixel cameras I have used, but the camera's low price means that it should really be compared with 3 megapixel cameras, in which case it is a great value.  The issues with the camera are typical with other point and shoot cameras in this size range.", "Date": "June 1, 2004"}, {"Title": "A mighty mite of a camera", "Author": "Rob \"eandtee\"", "ReviewID": "R3SRS3R70PRLKW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the Pentax S40 for the past three weeks, and am pleased with my purchase. I too selected this model because of the AA battery capability and have found the battery life to be very acceptable. I took over 100 flash pictures yesterday on a fully charged set of NiMH batteries. Spare NiMH batteries and a charger are quite cheap and most folks would carry a second set anyway. The photographic results are quite impressive. Certainly on par with my other digital camera which is the (much larger) Sony DSC-F707, though the slightly lower resolution (4mp to 5mp) would likely show on an 8x10. The viewfinder doesn't show the full size of the scene being framed on the LCD screen, but I believe this is true of most digicams.The telephoto works smoothly, and the LCD screen provides a clear and smooth look at the scene being framed. As with most LCD displays, it becomes less useful in bright sun.The camera is easy to set up and its menu system is intuitive and logical with a surprisingly large array of photographic options. It can also be used as an auto focus point and shoot camera with good results as my 12 year old daughter did recently on a school trip. Subsequently she spent a bit of time learning the camera, and now navigates the menus, etc., with ease.I'm using a 256mb Simpletech Secure Digital (SD) Pro-X High Speed card which has a much faster (10MB/sec) transfer rate than a standard SD card. The faster write speed frees the camera for its next shot much more quickly, and you won't believe how fast it transfers 256mb to a PC over a USB 2.0 (separate USB 2.0 reader needed) connection - whew!I also purchased the Pentax Optio Warranty Extension which gives this camera a full three years of coverage.

The user interface is pretty good - you can select the 'hot buttons' that are most frequently needed to change resolution, exposure override, etc.  So far, so good - right?Unfortunately, image quality isn't on a par with other 4MP cameras.  The S40 that I had was consistently soft along the left side of the image and had a similar, although smaller area on the right side of the image.  Image sharpness wasn't great throughout the frame regardless of the zoom setting, although the colors were accurate and well saturated.  There was a good bit of distortion at the widest setting, although this seems to be pretty common with very small digital cameras.

(lcd display returns when flash is charged, ie it's ready for another shoot!)battery power isn't all THAT bad... unless u really shoot alot and left it on most of the time. the camera heats up slightly after about 5 mins of it being switched on. i recommend getting a 256mb SD card since the video capture can take long video clips.those with problems with video capture: have to hold the shutter button halfway down until it registers before fully depressing it to start capture. to stop just a full depress will do.i had some problems downloading the pictures initially. apparently i need to have the camera switched on BEFORE i plug the usb connection and not switch on the camera AFTER i plug as stated in the manual.great camera for it's price as i think you can't really get any better camera that's cheaper!

My last camera was the more high-end, enthusiast-oriented Nikon Coolpix 995, but I couldn't tuck it in the pocket of my jeans and forget about it like the optio S40. In terms of aesthetics, the S40 rivals Canon's Digital Elph series, with its sleek, flat design and brushed metal exterior. Photographers seeking more versatility will want something larger, more complex, and more expensive, but casual snapshooters who want basic shots and short video clips (with sound) at parties, on trips, etc. will probably be satisfied. This camera is a pretty good deal at costco, which is the only store I know of that will accept returns on digital cameras without a 15% restocking fee. All in all, the Optio S40 is not a bad value.

Positives:1) Ergonomics - look and feel is very nice.2) Picture quality - the picture quality is also very nice.3) Batteries - one of the reasons I bought this was the fact it takes AA batteries, unlike most other small compacts I considered.4) Manual controls - the camera has plenty of manual controls, more than I'll ever use.  I especially like the ability to select 4MP/3MP/2MP/1MP resolutions, each in FINE quality mode.5) Movie mode - shoots at 30fps which makes for smooth movies albeit at 320x240 (quite acceptable for a camera).6) Menu system - quite easy to learn and navigate.Negatives:1) Performance - unfortunately, the camera is a bit slow, even with a high speed SD card.  a) Shot-to-shot - in 4MP/Fine mode is just over 5 seconds with flash, and just over 3 seconds without flash.  This is with post-review off, which usually helps to some degree.  This performance improves slightly as resolution/quality is decreased.  For example, at 2MP/Fine without flash shot-to-shot is under 2.5 seconds.  Note this performance is with a high speed Panasonic SD card.  b) Continuous mode - the camera can shoot 2 pix while in continuous mode in about 2 seconds.  Then, a noticeable delay for the 3rd and subsequent pictures.  This is for 4Mp/Fine, and does also improve for lower res/quality.  c) Start-up speed - no better than 4-5 seconds.Overall, I really like this camera, and would recommend as long as its coupled with a high speed SD card.", "Date": "April 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Lousy Interface", "Author": "Ray", "ReviewID": "R3BPXYRYBM429M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera has a good mechanical interface that is very well designed and easy to use.

In four days time, I took hundreds of photos.  But then the camera inexplicably locked up on me & would not let me close the lens - I tried replacing the batteries - nothing worked - the lens was frozen in the open position.  Whatever made the lens lock-up - also corrupted the SD disk & none of the digital photos on the disk were retrievable.  I lost all my photos!  The next day, I overnighted the camera back to my parents so they could return it to the store within the 10-day return policy.  Thinking it was some defect in that individual S-40 camera, they bought me another S40 (b/c I loved the small camera size) & they shipped the new S40 to me.  So 3 days after I get my SECOND \"new\" S-40, it does the same exact lock-up & won't let me close the lens.  This second lock-up involved: a different \"new\" S-40, a different SD card & different rechargable batteries - all the factors were different from the 1st lockup w/ the 1st S-40 camera.  Again, the lockup of the lens corrupted the SD card and I could not retrieve my photos & lost them all.  Frustrated & with no way to get any tech support, I simply packed the useless $300 camera in my suitcase & still haven't touched it since.  I never dropped either S-40 - both of which were actively working only for about 3-4 days each.  For 2 different S-40 cameras to have the same exact defect in two completely different situations - it has to be a manufacturing defect.  I certainly never mistreated either of the cameras.  I'm appalled to read other people's reviews that have had the exact same trouble that I just described & Pentax is not fixing their cameras under the under the warranty policy.

A AA size NiMh battery in good condition will deliver about 1.42 volts which in my experience operated my S40 for about 18 months with regular recharges.  Now they do not work even when fully charged.Interestingly the S40 works fine with plain old Duracell AA batteries, but keep in mind they deliver 1.5 volts each (actually more when new). The problem seems to be there is a capacitor in the camera that seems to require a charge even for simple non flash operation and it appears the capacitor can be degraded with long term low voltage battery use.My NiMh batteries began to work once again after a short period of S40 use with the Duracells.  My theory is the Duracells at 3+ volts total, had the power necessary to charge up the capacitor to the point where the camera will now operate with the lower voltage MiMh batteries (about 2.8 volts total when fully charged).My latest approach is using a Lith ion rechageable crv3 from Radio Shack which delivers 3+ volts.

The night mode on this camera also doesn't work very well so if you want to take a picture in the dark it won't work unless there's enough surrounding light such as street lights, etc.  This camera can do video although the quality isn't very good. You can't zoom while you  video and it does not do sound well. The resolution when you download it on a computer is not the best. The sound recording on it does not record music good at all but it is good for voice and can record for an hour or so. If you know how to fix any of those problems please post below and tell me.  My friend got a Nikon Coolpix L22 for just $90 and it works much better than this $200 one does! My Grandma's Kodak is even a little better.There are a lot of better cameras out there for less money or for around the same price like the Nikon Coolpix and the Canon Powershots.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Favorite Pentax Optio S40", "Author": "Martha B.

I bought a Kingston 1GB SecureDigital Flash Card ( SD/1GB ) (Retail Package) and that has worked very well.  It is actually a very versatile camera too.  I've had it in Iraq with me for 10 months, taken hundreds of pictures with it, dropped it, sat on it, let it ride all over the place in a duffle bag, and spill soda on it, and it still works as good as the day I got it.  It is fairly small, so it fits in a pocket or in a cupholder great.  It takes AA batteries which I was kind of skeptical about at first, but I bought some Energizer AA Lithium Photo Battery - 4-pk. and they have worked very well.  The first set of those batteries lasted me 4 months before they needed replacing.  The zoom works well except if you are trying to zoom in on something really far away (100 ft or more).  The only complaint that I have with this camera is that it is slow booting up and lags in between taking pictures.

Garvey \"Shastalore\"", "ReviewID": "R3TAHJAXQKXX6H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Most important, and most obvious fact, is that the Pentax Optio S40 is not at all a current item.  It's ready to retire.  When making a purchase, be sure to heed the four stages in the lifespan of a digital camera: New... reaching its prime... over the hill... and finally (for the Pentax Optio S40)... ready to retire. As such, the going price for an operating Pentax Optio S40 camera is now about $ 5.00, at a yard sale, or flea market  -and that usually includes a handy SD card left in there by the previous owner.And my entire review is based on this item as a $ 5.00 camera.  And, for those who take their photography seriously, even $ 5.00 is just false economy.But, back to the title of this review, and in all fairness, most digital cameras are not NiMH rechargeable battery-friendly. The Pentax Optio S40 camera will shut down when the NiMH rechargeable batteries discharge down to 1.30 volts. Whereas other brands of digital cameras may continue to take photos below 1.30 volts, only for the hapless photographer to later discover, back on their home computer, that those \"below 1.30 volt\" jpeg files are often corrupt. The 1.30 volt cut-off is simply an indication of an effort by Pentax to set higher quality standards.But to keep life simple, and permanently solve the problem, use a CR-V3 rechargeable lithium-ion battery, which delivers 3+ volts. A single battery, cleverly molded to fit snugly into the two-battery compartment, the lithium-ion chemistry is claimed to hold its charge for up to a year. In fact, I also use this handy, yet economical set of two CR-V3 rechargeable lithium-ion batteries + wall charger + 12VDC auto plug: 2 Lithium-Ion Battery&Charger; for Kodak CR-V3 CRV3 Advertised as a 4.2 Watt-hour battery, which translates to about a 1.4 Amp-hour (=1400mAh) capacity, it charges up to a good 3.28 volts. And the rechargeable lithium-ion chemistry will hold a full charge for months, and has a life expectancy of about 600 cycles, more than making up for its lower storage capacity. Unfortunately, many twin-AA 3 volt digital cameras and electronic devices are designed not to accept this unique type of battery.Another common issue with this camera is that the Pentax Optio S40 never did take hand-held indoor ambient light (no flash) photos well, unless there the room was exceptionally bright. At least a monopod mount is required for most indoor, quality ambient light photography.Tied in to the above issue is the issue of focus:  If, after a couple of seconds, automatic focus fails to lock-in to the subject, one has to remember to quickly select the manual focus (MF) mode, which works quite well  -but only for still shots.  Again, at least a monopod mount is a minimum requirement, as even outdoor shots can be unnervingly out of focus, and not obvious until later viewed on a home computer.Yet another issue with this camera is the time required to shoot and process each photo:  I usually shoot 640x480 (0.31MP) photos, for ease of emailing, posting to the web, etc.. But a 2304x1728 (4.0MP) will take about 8-10 seconds to process, an unnervingly long time when waiting to take the next shot.But back again to those who really prefer to use NiMH rechargeable batteries:With freshly charged (1.45 volts) 2500mAh NiMH rechargeable batteries installed in the Pentax Optio S40 camera I am able to take about thirty 640x480 pixel photos (half of them with the flash), plus a 30-second video.That's right on par with 1.5 volt AA disposable alkaline batteries (which are so toxic in the landfills, I feel should be illegal). Just be sure to use a high grade NiMH-specific charger for all of your NiMH batteries: For 30 minute quick charges I use a RadioShack Model 23-1305 charger that individually monitors and effectively charges an ecclectic mix of up to four AA or AAA batteries, of differing brand names and mAh capacities. For overnight charging, as well as rejuvenating tired old NiMH batteries, I use a C.Crane KC-983 charger that individually monitors and effectively charges a matched set of up to four AAA, AA, C or D batteries, of the same brand name and same mAh capacity.But most NiMH rechargeable batteries on the market self-discharge, some as much as 10% per day. And when the NiMH batteries drop to 1.30 volts, that annoying \"Depleted battery\" screen message appears and the camera shuts down. This means that NiMH batteries will self-discharge in the camera to a \"Depleted battery\" condition within 24-48 hours. I've even tried out some of those new \"slow discharge\" NiMH batteries that promise to hold their charge \"... four times as long...\"  -which simply means that your NiMH powered device will always be in a discharged state every time you really need it.But I have had decent results with the Energizer AA 4x NiMH 2300mAh battery, but unfortunately was unable to find an exact Amazon.com product to link to from here, since I picked up a 4-pack of these at a local Home Depot store. Straight out of the charger, the surface charge of 1.43 volts per battery self-discharges to 1.40 volts by the next day, but stabilizes and continues to self-discharge at a much slower rate until, about 30 days later, both batteries are self-discharged down to 1.30 volts each.And also, there's an occasional quirk with this camera, as another reviewer also pointed out: There is a capacitor in the internal circuit that can be degraded with long term low voltage battery use. This means that, occasionally, even with a freshly charged pair of NiMH batteries, that irritating \"Depleted battery\" screen message may appear. But a quick fix, as the same reviewer pointed out, is to load a pair of 1.5 volt AA disposable alkaline batteries, turn the camera on, and then after it boots up, turn the camera off. This will recharge that capacitor and allow NiMH batteries to be used again. As mentioned, this is only an occasional issue. What I prefer to do is run a rechargeable 3.6 volt lithium-ion battery (650mAh) into the external 3 volt DC jack (standard \"A\" plug, 2.35mm O.D., 0.7mm I.D., negative ground: positive tip, negative barrel) to jump-start the problematic on-board capacitor (plug in, turn on camera, allow camera to completely boot up, turn off camera, unplug). I will then be able to use NiMH batteries again. A good habit is to give the camera a quick 3.6 volt lithium-ion shot into the external 3 volt DC jack, before loading up a freshly charged pair of NiMH batteries.Yet another reviewer pointed out a valuable trick that I'd like to reprint, just so it doesn't escape anyone's notice:  An undocumented \"reset\" for the camera:  From the OFF state, press and hold MENU as you press then the POWER button.Final Notes:The reason I put up with this camera is that it does the job. With up to a 12x optical-digital zoom, full VHS (320x240, 30 fps, with audio) avi-file movie capability, and many other settings, it will do most of what I need it to do. And when set in Auto Select mode (aka: Smiley Face mode), I can let others use the camera  -and with acceptable results.And another good reason for using an old, somewhat obsolete digital camera is that I am willing to subject such a device to extreme punishment, take risks in damaging, losing, sometimes having my camera stolen.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "**WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP CAM**", "Author": "Venomous", "ReviewID": "R2CCB090O13DJ7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "A friend of mine gave me this cam as a gift and as soon as i took one picture.I got the infamous battery depleted error popping up.I recommend anyone considering to buy this cam google pentax optio s40 battery depleted.So far there is no fix.They should do a recall and the sellers up here should quit trying sell it to pple that are not aware of the malfunction it has.O well in the garbage it gos.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is not a good camera", "Author": "R.
