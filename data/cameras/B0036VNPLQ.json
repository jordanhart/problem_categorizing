I expected a no-frills camera with good optics and ease-of-use; I was looking for value and small size. Although I got what I expected -- and for that the T-100 deserves a five-star rating--the camera has other limitations and flaws that consumers should weigh against the cost and the competition. Note: all the 12MP T-100s -- red, blue, black, and silver-- are the same except for the body color.Pros: sharp 12 MP pictures in an inexpensive camera; rechargeable lithium battery (which some people may view as a con); a lens cover that is recessed when closed so that does not open easily if you accidentally brush against it; built-in flash that can be set to go off either automatically or only on demand; a sizable LCD screen for composing and viewing photos; the ability to focus on an object, then compose the photograph with it no longer in the center (shutter button halfway down before snapping); menu functions that actually work -- self-timer, macro, portrait, landscape, sports, etc. -- 21 in all; VGA movie mode to shoot brief videos; SDHC memory card-compatible (Olympus used to have their own XD card format); image stabilization; 3x zoom; ability to zoom in and out while shooting video; battery can be charged using either a regular outlet or a powered USB port; adjustable compression and picture quality settings.Cons: the housing is mostly plastic, making it feel only one step up from a disposable camera; no memory card included, not even one that will hold a few photos; battery must charge inside camera, making it difficult to prepare extra batteries for a trip; battery does not arrive charged, as many companies are doing today; with few outside buttons, most features need to be activated through the on-screen menu, making it cumbersome to switch from one to another; a somewhat thick body with rectangular corners on one side which makes it awkward to slip into a pocket; a user manual and software on CD that is only usable on a Windows machine; it takes a while to figure out the menu items.The camera comes with a lithium battery, a wrist strap; a charger with USB cable; and a software/manual disc that works only on Windows machines. If you order this, you should buy at the same time an SDHC card such as Transcend 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6. This camera has been marketed as ideal for teenagers, primarily because of the cost but also because of the ease of use. Of course, it also means that adults might be disappointed with its construction. It is definitely not as high-tech/cool-looking as the other small point-and-shoots in the Nikon and Canon lines. I'd give it 4 stars for the photographic quality, 3 stars for aesthetics and housing; 5 stars for overall value.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "CHEAP CAMERA", "Author": "Brandon Williams \"~B*DUB~\"", "ReviewID": "R1VHFRD8MFASE1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is not the type of camera you would expect from Olympus I have purchased other products from them and none of them have ever felt this cheap. Although I was told this was a new camera it felt like it was refurbished. I refused to turn off or on at times,could not view images on memory card without the camera freezing and the lens sometimes doesn't retract. I would not recommend this camera to someone who is serious about quality. It does come with a rechargeable battery but you have to charge it while it is inside the camera.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pros and Cons Make It Difficult to Give a Star-rating", "Author": "Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "ReviewID": "R2RUJDF26NUFCX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a small point-and-shoot camera that I could easily stash in my purse for quick snapshots, and I settled on the Olympus T-100 because of price and my outstanding experience with an Olympus Stylus.

It is a bad camera.  He especially likes to take videos and you cannot play back your videos with sound.  It is not listed in the description that there is no sound in playback mode.  And the face detection seems to detect everything but a face.  Pretty much all the description is deceptive.  It is bad quality, bad pictures, bad video, too much light, not enough light...  It also takes forever for the camera to capture the picture so if the person is moving while you snap the shot you might just get an empty picture in the end.Just overall a bad value.  Learned my lesson, there will be no more Olympus cameras coming into my house.  It's going for a return.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "Denise Ruth", "ReviewID": "R3GDKFMEEHGKMO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Takes very nice pic but I dont like the fact that the case is very light weight which would break easily", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Its Amazing", "Author": "Mine", "ReviewID": "R3TTLLFA5XFVTD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its Amazing , Packing also Nice.

I was disappointed that it would only hold 3 photos until I discovered that you can change the number of megapixels to a lower value and fit more photos in the memory.  I bought a 4 gig high performance card for a few bucks anyway and now it holds hundreds of photos.  Anyone remember film and developing?It operates smoothly, takes great pictures, the macro function exceeded my expectations and it's less expensive than other point and shoot cameras.  Maybe I'm too easy to please but I'm glad to be the first 5 star rater.Will I still be happy in a year?

I got it for the kids and thought it would be light and simple and Olympus is a good brand usually.It's very lightweight and has a cheap toy plastic feel to it.This camera is a bit difficult for the kids to work and hit the right button. Almost all the pictures were unusable. The pictures are more like bad cell phone quality and are out of focus most of the time. The videos are terrible. This thing is getting thrown in the garage sale. My ten year old Canon 3.2 MP camera runs rings around this one and almost all the photos and videos come out well for them.Save yourself some time and get a Canon.", "Date": "September 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fuzzy", "Author": "Darlina Anthony", "ReviewID": "R8GTRMQGY3TWS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I gave this thing away.

The camera is light, that is about it. It is quite difficult to push the button since it is small, rectangular and recessed into the body. Strange design idea when most cameras offer a round button that may even be slightly raised. My children use their finger nail to push the button which results in sloppy pictures. The next biggest problem is the battery. As mentioned in another review, the battery must be charged through the camera so there is never the option to have a replacement in your camera bag, when you run out that is it for the day. This camera will be delegated to the toy box.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice small camera", "Author": "Doug-Bogart,Ga.", "ReviewID": "R2XCYTQ55M7FIX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I almost didn't buy this camera because of the reviews, but because of the price and service I've gotten from Amazon, I went for it!
