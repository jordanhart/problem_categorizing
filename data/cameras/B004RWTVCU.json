You'd get a more realistic and recognizable image, you'd be able to make more than 20 pictures, and you could more easily access the pictures.1.3 mega pixel is unacceptable, so I don't know why this exists in 2013.  But the low quality doesn't matter because the pictures are all trapped on there.  Despite the box stating \"Mac Compatible\" it stores the photos in it's own proprietary format requiring the included Windows-only software to access.  It doesn't even appear on my computer when I plug in the USB cable (also with a non-standard a proprietary connector).  There is no memory card slot, so that method is out as is taking pictures beyond the 20 or so that it has room for in internal memory.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "blurry", "Author": "Flamingo Fanatic \"FF\"", "ReviewID": "R2E24V9LGNGCDL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just bought this little camera. It is certainly cheap. And I mean that in every possible way. Plastic everything, no way to hold the image stable during a shot. It has a delay feature, but the thing is an oval. There is no way to prop it up while shooting. (Silly putty?)It does include a web-cam feature, which is mildly cool, but it isn't mounted, so you still have the blurry/wobbly thing going on.
