It takes great pictures and easily fits in a pocket or purse.Love all of the best shot modes, they all seem to work great. Also love the anti-shake feature.. it works great. All other cameras that I have used the anti-shake features didn't work at all.This camera also takes great action shots, even from a moving car!!

Does everything she wants it to do. The battery life is excellent.Only reason for the four stars instead of five is that the controls are a little cryptic to figure out from just using it, definately read the manual to access the different modes and such. But I'd buy it for her again in a minute.", "Date": "January 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "I love it!  but go ahead and buy a memory card!", "Author": "wjjjww", "ReviewID": "RYSG7I5EXY3CU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love love love this cute tiny camera.  takes great pictures.  small enough to keep with you all the time.  my teenagers have a blast easily putting their videos on youtube.  one thing.  go ahead and buy a memory card (the camera does not come with one).i bought the SanDisk Ultra II SDHC 4GB w/MicroMate USB 2.0 Bundle ( SDSDRH-4096-901 ) and it is perfect.", "Date": "January 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "I LOVE IT", "Author": "Paul Schlosser", "ReviewID": "R21A682M8I14L9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this camera, it styleish, great zoom, and is a perfect size totake anywhere.

Willis", "ReviewID": "RKN6LQWWCWLMY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a pretty and functional little camera. I love the color and the display is large and very bright, even in direct sunlight.That being said, it doesn't perform as well as the Kodak easyshare I bought it to replace. There is a grainy pixelation with speed shutter photos I take with this camera, and I never had that problem with my Kodak.The videos are another story. High quality and great sound, by far the best video I've gotten from any digital camera. And I really like that you have the option to take lesser quality videos to conserve memory or post online.So overall, I do like it, but given the choice, I don't think I'd buy a Casio again.", "Date": "May 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Low LCD quality, don't buy", "Author": "Sunflower \"Sunflower\"", "ReviewID": "RC31TA9P5UXLP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera online because it looks attractive, however, I am so disappointed that its LCD is so blur compared to my old Canon camera. I always use LCD to take and review pictures, because this LCD is so blur/low quality, it made me doubt whether my pictures are good or not. So don't judge something by its look, try it at a store, then make decision whether to buy it or not from web. In a word, not worth the money.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$279.99", "Features": "10 mega pixel, 3x optical\n2.6\" Wide Bright LCD\nFace Detection Technology\nYou Tube Video Capture Mode\nMPEG 4 H.264 Video", "Name": "Casio Exilim EX-Z1080 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Anti-Shake Optical Zoom (Pink)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AkTMW9iWL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000VHF7X2"}}
