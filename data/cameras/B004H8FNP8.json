{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazingly Cheap... Insane Quality! Get It!", "Author": "BrimoKnight", "ReviewID": "R1I0YEIEF6G0WX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very short and simple review. The camera ROCKS! Super easy to use, and navigate. It has many, and even more functions than I will need, but It doesn't overwhelm you! Turn on the camera and your ready to shoot. I love that the camera is a genius. No seriously, this camera detects your surroundings, SMART EH?. If its too dark it will adjust to twilight mode, or maybe there's a view of mountains and fields, the cam will instantly switch to landscape mode. It feels awesome to no longer need to turn any knobs so that the scene focus can change. Aside from this, what really-really made me want this camera was how the panorama shot sounded. Reading the feature before purchase really interested me. After I received the cam and tried it, I was so amazed at the intense wide capture my cam could make. Sure, if you sweep your hand to fast or shaky, you may just get a weird boxy image. However, take your time sweeping your hand and relax, and the image is beautiful enough to make you own home wall art. Lastly, I took video and the quality looked great on cam, I haven't uploaded video yet so I have no further details as to how good of quality video really is, but the pictures all come out stunning. Pfft, funny part is, I even have it on a lower pixel setting to capture a size of around 4x6... Everyone, no regrets... buy this truly cheap camera and forget about going to Walmart for a deal... Clearly the deal of quality and price is right here with this Sony. How I see it, I should scream to ya... GET IT NOW! :D", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the money", "Author": "No Name Baby", "ReviewID": "RM6XB67D8HI5J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a new everyday camera.

I did quite a bit of research and review before purchasing this camera! I already have a digital SLR, so I only need one for capturing everyday events like in school, at work, or visiting folks, day to day photography can only be made convenient with portable digital camera such as this one, imaging carry a SLR all day long :) ANyway, so it is however like a toy though, made with cheap plastics, appear super light, thus gives off a \"fragile\" vibe. Function wise, it is pretty decent, I pick this one especially for its build in \"isteady\" function, image quality is pretty good too, have an auto scene detection function that select the best image mode for you! Most impressive feature however though is the smile detection function, automatically takes a picture when subject smiles! pretty neat!over all, I am happy with this purchase at this point, now the question would be how long will it last?

Ciriello \"AdWhois\"", "ReviewID": "R35FZCFIN8ZVPK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "***Quick Note: This camera does not come with an SD card***When I bought this camera I was looking for a cheaper alternative to my DSLR camera that I could take with me to events where my big camera wasn't allowed or when I just didn't feel like taking the DSLR with me... This camera fits the bill perfectly.The Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-W510 is very small and the large screen takes up most of the real estate on the back. It's good to look for a physical zoom in a digital camera, which this one has and it works very well.I'm extremely impressed with the flash on this camera, maybe I've been using cellphone cameras for too long but I haven't seen a flash that's as bright and works as well as this one does on a Point and Shoot in a long while. Aside from just taking pictures, the camera can take video(with audio) and the really cool thing that's take panorama pictures in one shot. You simply hold down the button and rotate the camera, it does the rest... Very cool.I use a 4gb sandisk SD card and it seem to have plenty space (especially if you drop the quality down from 12MP). As I mentioned in the note, there was no SD card included with the camera so be sure to pick one up here on Amazon when you buy the camera to save yourself from in-store overpricing.This camera is definitely recommended, its a great price, compact size, good quality image, and comes with a rechargeable battery(and charger).

I don't know why it's doing this and I wanted to see if anyone else had this problem and/or if anyone knows how to fix this issue? I really wish I didn't have this problem- seemed like such a great deal and otherwise has great reviews!

I didn't want to spend a lot of money due to the fact that I just spent a bunch of money on the plane ticket so I searched amazon for weeks and finally decided to get this camera since the reviews weren't too horrible. The flash on this thing is TERRIBLE! It is way too bright so your face ends up ghost white and the background is swallowed by darkness; so basically you can say good bye to night photos. Pictures without flash come out alright as long as it is very light out. I really expected more from Sony since my last camera was amazing but oh well, that's what you get for $79.

I've had the chance to compare this to my older Samsung SL201. The Samsung cost me $110 and was FAR superior in QUALITY. Camera quality does not come from the amount of megapixels. My Samsung has 10.2 MP and the pictures are far sharper, the settings can be more precisely adjusted, and the pictures are always better than this Sony. You get what you pay for. The Sony has terribly blurry pictures. I'm not sure if people notice this or not, but all you have to do is zoom in to 100% when looking at the pictures on your computer. The panoramic mode is an awesome idea, but the picture is about 10 times blurrier when you use it, and never focuses properly.Video is terrible outdoors. You cannot zoom in, and it does not auto focus properly during recording. For some reason, when recoding video outdoors, the camera likes to smear the sunlight vertically across the screen and make everything pink, even when you're not aiming at the sun. Its not really possible to get the camera to stop acting like that until you stop recording and allow it to refocus by aiming it around until you're satisfied. As a matter of fact, here's proof on my Photobucket: [...]I'm no photographer, but I do have a good amount of personal experience in graphic design. When looking at cameras, if you don't care too much about quality and like ease of use, then get this. If you are looking for better quality, just pay $30 more and you'll probably get a much nicer camera. Never base your decision off of the amount of pixels. A camera is only as good as its sensor. I would look online at comparison shots between cameras to make the best choice. Also be aware of cameras that artificially boost contrast when taking pictures to cover up bad quality. It gives the perception of high quality.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "DSC-W510 - Frustrating!!", "Author": "Jay56", "ReviewID": "R2TEL1X9ILU5BF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Probably the worst camera I have every had.

So this is the place you needed to come for all of your accessories to go with your camera, get a bundle.  I guess it was an oversite on my part because Amazon.Com does sell this camera in a bundle list, if at all possible, do get the bundle because you will end up buying a memory stick and a spare battery.  I did buy a case on Amazon.Com, it did come with a battery, but no memory stick.  If you didn't see the bundle as I didn't, you can get a NP-BN1 Sony Battery for $2.69 through Eforcity and a 8GB Memory Stick for your Sony DSC W510 Camera for $9.99 through SoCal Trade both through Amazon.com for 14.98 and then a $7 something shipping charge in 2 separate orders totaling almost $20.  A Battery through the Sony Company directly would be $50 and Memory Sticks are a lot more as well, so this is the place to go.  It is still a lot easier to just buy a Bundle.  Hope you don't have to go through the disappointment of not having the stick when your camera arrives.  Have fun with your camera ;-)", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "EXCELENTE", "Author": "leyziitaxh", "ReviewID": "R2BTNMUHHSVJCL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ME ENCANTO LA CAMARA, EXCLENTE...

I tried it in every different setting and none of those gave me the picture quality that I was looking for.  If you take a picture and want to trim it later for adjustment,  the colors will just fade and the picture quality will noticeably decrease making your pictures look blurry and horrible. Something very annoying too is that the battery dies in less than two hours, after 50 shots you already have half of it gone.
