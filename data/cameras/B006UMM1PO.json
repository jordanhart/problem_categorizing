Coleman", "ReviewID": "ROPAUO5H8OHBE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a quality purchase and I did a huge amount of research as well as visiting and speaking with reps at both Best Buy and Frys. And I would've actually bought on Amazon had I had more time before going on vacation but I bought it at Frys Electronics.First off, I did many comparisons to other Canons recently released. This camera has all of the features of the 320HS except for the WiFi and the touch screen. This camera is identical except for those two features. And at the time of this purchase, those features were $30 more on that camera. But I also considered that the possibility of hardware failures increases the more features you add. Also, I didn't want to \"miss a moment\" waiting for the lag of a touch screen. I wanted to be able to push a button and have the picture snap. I also hate giving the camera to someone to snap a group photo and them not knowing where to touch on the screen. The traditional shutter button was a plus in my book.As for other features, I did a side by side comparison of the 520HS, 320HS, 310HS and 530HS. I opted for a higher resolution and a lower optical zoom because but with the Digic5 processor because, for casual photos, 5x optical should be sufficient. If I want to get a higher resolution with a greater optical zoom, I will just upgrade to a DSLR camera.I've also owned Canon's for many years and I was happy with previous versions. With the 110HS I took a couple hundred shots on a recent vacation and several videos in HD. The videos came out great with good sound quality for a point and shoot. And the photos were exceptional for the price point.Personally I also like the auto focus features and the fact that it seems to calculate exposures and makes adjustments when I don't have the flash on. I did find that turning the flash off gives a much more natural look and with it on my photo subjects seemed to run \"hot\" so I opted to have it off except in low light situations. The button configuration to toggle the flash on and off is both ergonomic and intuitive.Additionally, the menus are standard Canon-type, so if you are used to them, you will enjoy a familiar interface. If you are not used to Canon cameras, it won't take long to learn.Also, the quality of the hardware is good overall, but it does have a sort of plastic-ish feel. Not bad, as it keeps it lightweight, but be aware that some may find it chintzy feeling. I, personally, think it feels light and nice. The battery lasted for about 2 days taking a combination of videos and pictures but I always kept it off and in the storage case (for power conservation) when not in use.Finally, I do have to admit again that I bought the camera at Fry's Electronics in Burbank due to the fact that I was going on vacation the very next day. I bought the SquareTrade warranty direct from SquareTrade, which I felt was a great deal for about $50 bucks for 3 years. It's the same on Amazon's site or going through them but you cannot get the 2 year warranty if you go through SquareTrade directly and it seems you can get 2 years full coverage on Amazon, which I would have preferred.All in all, this is a quality camera with a reasonable battery life, good quality pictures and videos with an intuitive interface. I give it 5-stars and am very happy with my purchase.PS: I also got a SDHC 16 gig card, class 10 and it seems to be pretty speedy. I'd recommend getting one of those or larger as this camera does not include storage. Also look at picking up some sort of a case. I bought a CaseLogic case with a plush interior (from K-Mart for $10) and am happy with that as well.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Feature Set!", "Author": "Elizabeth", "ReviewID": "R2U1MV60IHSMEJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally purchased as a gift the Canon PowerShot A3400 IS 16.0 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom 28mm Wide-Angle Lens with 720p HD Video Recording and 3.0-Inch Touch Panel LCD (RED BUNDLE) which included the red camera, a case, and a memory card.Instead I ended up purchasing for her the Canon PowerShot ELPH 110 HS 16.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 5x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom 24mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full HD Video Recording (Silver) and returning the A3400.Having been a Canon fan and owner for many years, since my first Elph, here were my reasons.The 24mm wide angle zoom combined with 16.1 MP, DIGIC5, 1080P video, image stabilization, and 5x optical zoom, along with a great array of Canon special effects make this an unbeatable package in a Canon PowerShot Elph.The 3-inch LCD is nice and bright at 461,000 pixels. It is pocket-sized at 3.67 x 2.24 x 0.79 in.Overall, this camera produces snappy, bright, colorful shots in a surprising variety of lighting conditions, all in a tiny little package. It has fun effects like Toy Camera, Miniature, Sepia, and Black and White.The Elph 110 HS records video in HD 1080p at 24 fps or 720p at 30 fps.Who should get it:* If you like to shoot in low light. (see note below)* If you want to shoot HD video in 1080p* If you want a wide angle lens, this one has a 24mm wide angle lens* If you'd like a Super Slow Motion Movie Mode that records video at high speeds to allow playback in slow motion.* If you want that \"real film\" feel - this one supports 24p movies* The Elph 110 HS has a high resolution LCD screenBattery life:* Battery life is not the best I've seen - this camera is rated by Canon to get 170 shots out of a battery -- your experience may vary if you are shooting video. You may want to keep a spare battery on hand.A note about photos in low light:At first glance, the images appear to be good in low light. And for MOST purposes, it IS good in low light. But if I zoom in at an image to look at the details, I can see that finer details in the image are missing at higher ISOs. I use Photoshop though, so I zoom in really large on an image. Expect some detail missing if you are shooting in low light at higher ISOs.  But for most general purposes, this camera will do fine in low light.Some other cool features of this camera:* Color Accent - You pick one color to accent in your picture, and leave the rest of the picture in black and white. You pick out the color that is present in your scene before you take the photo. Everything in your photo that is, say, the color red, will show up as red, and everything else will show up as black and white.* Face ID Detection - Allows you to keep track of 12 faces (grouped as babies, children or adults), which you \"register\" by recording them with the camera. You can then search for photos with these people in them. For parents with babies, if the camera recognizes your baby is smiling, it will take 3 photos in rapid succession instead of a single shot. It has the ability to detect if your toddler is sleeping: if the camera detects this, it will turn off the flash and silence the shutter.* Super Slow Motion Video Recording - great for recording video of sports events. It records at 120fps or 240fps and plays back at 30fps which gives the effect of slow motion. It only records at 640x480 or 320x240.How it compares to other Canon Elphs:The Elph 110 HS is very close to the Canon Elph 320 HS, except the Elph 320 HS has a touchscreen, wifi and a larger viewscreen. The Elph 110 HS has a slightly faster high-speed burst mode and is a little lighter.The Elph 310 HS has an 8x zoom and has better macro. It can shoot at 3.5 fps continuous shooting vs the Elph 110 HS's 2 fps. The Elph 310 HS has DIGIC4 whereas the Elph 110 HS has DIGIC5. The 110 HS has the better 24 mm wide angle lens.The Elph 520 HS has 10.1 MP, a 12x optical zoom, and a faster 1/4000 shutter speed than the Elph 110 HS. But it has the decreased MP and it doesn't have the wide angle lens of the 110 HS. The Elph 520 HS's aperture is also wider at f3.4, so it doesn't let in as much light.The Elph 100 HS is slightly cheaper than the Elph 110 HS and has 12.1 MP and DIGIC4, slower shutter speed at 1/1,500, and about half as many dots on the LCD screen; however, its continuous shooting mode is 3.4 fps versus the 110 HS's 2 fps and in high-speed burst mode the Elph 100 HS is 8.2 fps versus 5.8 fps. The 110 HS has the wide angle lens; the 100 does not.What's in the box:* PowerShot ELPH 110 HS* Battery Pack NB-11L* Battery Charger CB-2LD* Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM* \"Getting Started\" Guide* USB Interface Cable* Wrist StrapWhat you will need:* Camera case, such as the Caselogic TBC-302 Ultra Compact Camera Case with Storage* Memory, such as the Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 10 Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC10E* A memory card reader or memory slotConclusion:Overall the Elph 110 HS to me is the best point-and-shoot that Canon offers as of this writing that meets most needs at a reasonable price point. One could also consider, depending on what you are looking for in a camera, the Canon PowerShot ELPH 100 HS Digital Camera with 4X Optical Zoom or the Canon 320 HS. The A3400 is another good value if you can find it on sale, especially the \"red bundle\" (red camera, case plus memory card) which is currently being offered. Good luck in your quest to find the right camera for your needs.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stunning Pictures", "Author": "P. McWhorter", "ReviewID": "R3S2FPHNA239MK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In preparing for a trip to a remote area of East Africa, I needed a camera that would fit in my pocket. I have a nice Canon Rebel with all the lenses, but the fear was that if I packed that in my luggage it would be stolen, and it is too bulky to fit in my very limited carry on bag. I purchased the Canon Powershot in the hopes that it would take reasonable pictures. My expectations were that it would not do as well as what I had come to expect with my full size Canon.The bottom line was that I was blown away with the picture quality and functionality of the camera. I was shocked at the brilliance, contrast and sharpness of the images. I took several thousand pictures on the trip and did not get one bad shot.Also due to limited space in my carry on bag, I was not able to take a separate video camcorder. I was pleasantly surprised with the video and sound quality from this small unit.Very rarely have I been as pleased with a product as I am with this one. It gets my enthusiastic recommendation!", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sharper, But Noisier Photos Than Some Others", "Author": "M. Kato \"MK\"", "ReviewID": "R353MEGAD0BHG5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the Canon ELPH 100 HS camera last year to try out the Canon HS System.  I was impressed with the relatively clean-looking images that can be taken in low light, compared to the noticeably noisy images taken with my older cameras.  However, when I zoomed in on parts of the images to look at details, the images were soft and lacking the detail I wanted.  The ELPH 100 HS also did not have an optical zoom for video - only a digital zoom, and only if the still image aspect ratio is set at 4:3.  I considered getting the ELPH 300 HS, which had a 24mm wide angle lens and which did have optical zoom for video, but I decided to go for the models with the newer DIGIC 5 processor, which Canon described as follows:\"The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you take bright, clear photos in an even wider range of shooting situations. Beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The system is the result of two technologies brought together in PowerShot cameras: a high-sensitivity imaging sensor, which is able to capture more light; and the DIGIC Image Processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image processing. The 16.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor in the PowerShot ELPH 110 HS digital camera incorporates advanced light reception technology that enhances sensitivity. The DIGIC 5 Image Processor provides a major boost in noise reduction, expanding the usable ISO range to an amazing high of ISO 3200. The Canon HS SYSTEM takes the frustration out of low-light shooting, delivering clear, blur-free images.\"Based on the representation that the DIGIC 5 processor \"provides a major boost in noise reduction,\" I decided to pre-order the ELPH 110 HS at $249 on Amazon.com. - the 310 HS has a longer zoom lens range, but starts at 28mm and did not have the 24mm wider angle that I wanted.  The 110 HS is also available in black, whereas the 100 HS and the 310 HS did not have a black model.  The 310 HS also has the DIGIC 4 processor, not the newer DIGIC 5 processor that provided the \"major boost in noise reduction.\"  Then I read the review by PC Magazine:\"I used Imatest to measure the sharpness of photos captured by the Elph 110 HS, and the results were actually quite good. We consider a sharp image to be one that contains a center-weighted average of 1,800 lines per picture height, and the 110 HS exceeded that--recording 2,189 lines. In this regard the camera ran circles around the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH27 ($229.95, 2.5 stars), a camera that only managed 1,548 lines.High ISO performance was another matter entirely. We consider a clean image to be one that contains less than 1.5 percent noise. The Elph 110 HS was only able to keep noise under this threshold through ISO 200, a surprisingly low setting.  That said, it only registered about 1.6 percent at ISO 400 and ISO 800, so it isn't going to produce terribly grainy photos at higher ISO settings. That's the good news. The bad news is that the camera applies some pretty aggressive noise reduction to hit even these just-ok numbers. Detail is slightly diminished at ISO 400, but you can still make out textures and fine lines in the image. At ISO 800 it's bad, and at ISO 1600 it's pretty terrible--any semblance of texture is gone from your photo by that point.  The Canon PowerShot Elph 310 HS does a much better job both in terms of image noise and preservation of detail--it keeps noise under 1.5 percent through ISO 800, while managing to do a great job with image detail through ISO 400. At ISO 800 it's not that bad at all, although at ISO 1600 the 310 HS is also a victim of some heavy-handed noise reduction.. . . .The PowerShot Elph 110 HS is a good compact camera, but not a great one. Its lens is sharp, but Canon's decision to cram 16 megapixels onto a tiny sensor results in noisy images at higher ISO settings. The camera attempts to counteract this with noise reduction, but only serves to kill detail in photos at higher ISOs. This won't be a problem on smaller-size screens, but if you want to share your photos on larger LCDs or prints, the lack of texture and detail at higher ISO settings will be noticeable.Canon also turns out to be its own worst enemy here--if the PowerShot 310 HS wasn't available for a mere $10 more, the 110 HS would be easier to recommend. The 310 HS, which earned our Editors' Choice award for midrange compact cameras, features a nearly identical design and a more impressive 8x zoom lens. It does have fewer megapixels and its lens doesn't provide the extra-wide 24mm field of view of the 110 HS, but when you consider the noise reduction that the 110 HS requires to shoot images at ISO 800 and above, you really aren't losing much in terms of image quality when shooting in anything but bright light.\"This review was disappointing - apparently, instead of producing a \"major boost in noise reduction,\" the DIGIC 5 processor in the 110 HS was noisier than the DIGIC 4 processor in the 310 HS.  Now the question was whether I should cancel my pre-order of the 110 HS.  I put off the decision, because the \"release date\" for the 110 HS was not until March 31, 2012.  On March 30, I noticed that the price had dropped by $20, so I decided to cancel my pre-order.  But then I saw that my order of the 110 HS at the original price of $249 was labeled as having been shipped, so it was too late to cancel.  [UPDATE JUNE 30, 2012 -- two months after the release date, the price of the ELPH 110 HS has dropped by $50 or twenty percent -- it does make my decision to pre-order the camera and not cancel the pre-order in time look pretty bad -- that will be the last time I pre-order from Amazon.com a new Canon camera model.  UPDATE AUGUST 5, 2012 -- four months after the release date, the price of the black ELPH 110 HS has dropped by another $30 or a total of $80 or thirty-two percent from the original $249 that I paid!  If I had known, I would have waited four months to save $80 or thirty-two percent.]Since receiving the 110 HS on April 2, 2012, I have been using it as my everyday carry camera - it is as thin and light as my 100 HS.  The images taken in bright daylight look fine to me.  The images taken at higher ISOs do look a bit noisy, but they are sharper than the images taken with my 100 HS.  When I zoomed in on the images in the camera and on the computer, I could see more detail, even in the images taken indoors.  So there still is the trade off between sharpness and noise - on the balance, I prefer the additional sharpness that I get with the 110 HS, even though there is more noticeable noise.  In addition, the 110 HS provides the wider 24mm angle and provides optical zoom during video.Unfortunately, the 110 HS is the same as the 100 HS regarding the limitation on the use of digital zoom - digital zoom is only available at the 4:3 still image aspect ratio, while I prefer to shoot at the 3:2 still image aspect ratio to match the 4 X 6-inch prints that I usually order.  I was surprised to find that the images taken with the digital zoom looked better than the images taken at the maximum optical zoom and cropped on the computer to match the magnification of the digital zoom, so now I set the camera at the 4:3 still image aspect ratio with the digital zoom turned on in case I want to take quick snapshots with the digital zoom.  I compared images of a FedEx truck taken through an office opened window with the digital zoom of the 110 HS and with a 70-300mm (at 300mm or the 35mm equivalent of 450mm) lens on a Nikon D5100.  The image taken with the D5100 was less noisy and sharper than the image taken with the digital zoom of the 110 HS, but all of the letters and numbers on the side of the truck could be read in the digital zoom image taken with the 110 HS, except the Grumman name plate on the side of the truck, which could be read only in the image taken with the D5100.  I was pleased to learn that I could take usable photos with the 110 HS when I am not carrying the DSLR and zoom lens with me.If you are looking for a thin, light, and not too expensive [UPDATE -- especially at the $169.99 price as of Aug. 5, 2012; on Nov. 29, 2012, the prices on Amazon.com range from $129 to $179 depending on the color of the camera] everyday carry camera with reasonable sharpness, with a lens with the 24mm angle of view at the wide end of the zoom, and in the color black, the ELPH 110 HS may suit your needs.  I decided to keep the 110 HS, which is my fifth Canon compact camera (but the first one in black).  The 110 HS is a good compact camera that is my current everyday carry camera to have handy for quicky snapshots of various things and people, but, as PC Magazine said, it is \"not a great one.\"  If images with lower noise are desired, there are other camera models around this price range and size that should be considered and, of course, there are more expensive cameras with bigger sensors that will provide images with lower noise.", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lovely Little Camera: Incredibly Easy to Use, Fantastic Photos and Video", "Author": "GrazziDad", "ReviewID": "R3HJX9YM7BN5QN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd previously had the IS1400, and loved it -- so sleek -- but it was co-opted by a family member. Figuring this was a sign from the cosmos that I should update for an upcoming trip abroad, I checked out tons of cameras, and almost went with a similar Panasonic that had just come out. In any case, the 110 won out for the simple reason that it boasted not only terrific specs (HD video and a healthy pixel count for photos) and was truly pocketable, but because it did NOT have a touch screen. Many people had commented negatively on the absence of dedicated buttons for accessing menus and prior photos, and I have to agree with them: you don't want to be futzing with a touch-screen just to quickly access a capability that a dedicated button would instantly allow, especially in strong daylight.The photos and video I took (over 2000 so far) in full daylight have been nothing short of stunning, much better than the already-terrific IS1400. If this is your main use, don't hesitate. Photos in modest lighting were also quite good, due to the new sensor and specialized Low Light setting. Night photos were again better than the last generation, but not nearly so good as a camera designed for that capability (e.g., the S90-95-100 series).Even though the camera is tiny -- you can carry it in your pocket and literally forget it's there -- there were a couple of very minor drawbacks. First, it's somewhat boxy in shape; the IS1400 was incredibly slim, with rounded edges. The 110 is very thin, but entirely rectangular, with squared-off corners. Second, the battery lasts for about 200-300 shots. This is sufficient for lots of situations, but not if you cannot recharge it daily, or even more often; I took along a spare (easily obtainable for 1/5 the Canon price from multiple vendors), and am glad I did. Lastly, the screen isn't touch-capable. For that, it seems you'd need to give up the dedicated buttons, which I absolutely didn't want to do. All very minor, as I said.If you're looking for an idiot-proof, truly pocketable camera that takes first-rate photos and HD video, you won't be disappointed.

Stunned, I dropped into the nearest retail store & bought a quick make-do replacement. I chose the Elph 110 HS because it had the widest aperture of all the offerings (f2.7) & was the most pocketable. I prayed that our vacation pictures would be decent.After 10 days of putting the Elph 110 HS through its paces, I think I'll keep it.  The color quality is wonderful. The camera meters well. The image sharpness varies: soft in the corners, and not as sharp at wide angle or tele. The best images are mid range; at 2 feet to 25 feet, the Elph 110 is as sharp as anything from the S90. You need to pay strict attention to where the camera is focusing as the auto settings latch on to strange things. Make sure to switch between macro, mid & distant focusing. I was happier using SuperFine compression & custom color settings, bumping up the sharpness, contrast & saturation a bit, and shooting in P (Program) mode where I could control the focus.  Auto has its uses, and for quick snaps, it does a good job.  The flash set just the right amount of fill flash. I was especially pleased with my flash shots. My low light pictures turned out fine with additional flash or slower shutter speed or a white balance adjustment or a little exposure compensation, and I didn't have to bother using higher ISO settings. It is marvelously portable, slipping into pockets, purses, small fanny packs & eyeglass cases with ease. Battery goes from empty to fully charged in two hours.The camera has good capabilities: exposure lock, focus lock, flash exposure lock, exposure compensation, Canon's ample array of color effects, good white balance settings (including custom white balance), a good drive mode, and can even take photos in square format (I like!). It has Stitch Assist for panoramic shots.  Long Shutter mode allows for shutter times up to 15 seconds & is easy to use. There is a grid display option.Settings: Less useful ones are toy camera, fish eye (wish it were a true fish eye), posterizer, soft focus, miniaturizer.  There is a snow setting, but no sunset setting.  There is no sports/kids/pets or otherwise high shutter speed setting. Supposedly in auto the camera can detect children or babies & automatically switch to drive mode. You can print a single image from video, but I can't attest to image quality. Face ID (the camera can \"memorize\" faces) might be useful if you have kids, but I can't see using it much.Cons: There is much menu diving, especially to do the work arounds for tricky shots. I couldn't get Tracking AutoFocus to work well. No RAW and no choice of color space. The histogram display is post-shot only. It blows out highlights like crazy, but so did my S90. I confuse the shutter button with the on/off button sometimes, again just like my S90.In short, it's a better than average camera that can do a lot. If you are patient in setting up the work arounds to compensate for the lack of a Manual setting, you can get the trickier shots.  I wish the sharpness were more consistent across various types of shooting. But if you just want a camera for family/friends snap shots, the sharpness is excellent for that kind of photography.", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "A pocket full of Quality - a Canon A+ system", "Author": "Scott Anderson \"Sharpsburg\"", "ReviewID": "R2BYY0LCF8O36E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon has really hit the mark with this unit.

Screens fade with time and in direct sun light that could be a problem for my eyes. I like that you can shoot your pictures in 16:1 wide screen.

Ability to shoot HD movies is a nice plus. Every where you go on the internet people talk about how much better digital SLR cameras are. I like little cameras because I can have this in my pocket to use or not. No questions about why you are bringing a camera along and all that. It has been my experience that people are less shy about being in a photo when the camera is small. The camera does NOT come with a memory chip! Buy a class 10 SD XC Transcend chip. XC is a better choice over HC. 16GB is a good size. HD movies use huge amounts of memory.

I can't live with blurry photos so I have to add in flash, but there's the thing, the flash is to close to the lens that 8 out of 10 shots I see a black pie shape shadow on the lower right color.  I took pictures of food up close with flash and the black spot on the corner totally ruins the picture.  Ok, so now I read other people's review that addressed this issue.  It's a design issue.  Now I see that most of the newer high end Canon Point-and-Shoot has a Pop-up flash.Another thing I feel that shouldn't had been done were the very flat-flush buttons which are not so easy to press down.  It should have  a slight bump because my thumb feels sore having to browse through the pictures and the menus.The videos are amazing outdoor but the zoom totally ruins it with noticeable motor noise.The video indoor recording is great when you're zoomed out, but zooming it the exposure is having difficulty lighting up subjects so you go from bright to dim as you zoom up close.Video files are about 1 min = 400 MB recorded in MOV file.

I took one in to be repaired and they sent me back the newly released 110 HS model since they had just discontinued the 300 HS.While the photo quality on the 110 HS seems to have taken a nice little bump up in improvement, the video has take a serious downturn as compared to the 300.The sound is just terrible. It picks up all hand movement on the camera, the zoom button sound, and it also seems to have trouble adjusting between far away and close in sounds. It sometimes sounds completely muted, like maybe wind noise reduction kicked on for some reason and then when someone talks close by you only hear muffled noise (and my hand is NOT over the mic). Its frankly horrible. I was seriously disappointed the other day in the mountains when we had elk communicating back in forth around us, they were quite loud (the equivalent of someone talking), and when I downloaded the video it picked up NADA.

I cannot even enhance the audio to pick it up.The auto focus while videoing I thought would be better as it seemed to pick things up quicker to focus on then the 300, but instead, it just adjusts constantly. So you can be sitting completely still and it will randomly focus on your face, then on the background, then back to your face again. So tired of thinking I got a shot only to find out halfway through it decided to focus on something else for awhile. So while the 300 HS had some delays in its focus time, I would take that any day over the random changes of the 110 HS.Lastly, the camera body quality has also taken a serious nose dive.

Canon originally had the Elph 110 pegged as a camera coming in below the Elph 300 series and priced closer to $100 than to $200.  However, the camera received ratings from professional critics that ranked it in the category of \"best of breed.\"  Subsequently, the Elph 110 shot up in price until this moment, as Amazon has pulled off another of its striking value plays, discounting this coveted camera way beneath the prices its commanding from other sellers.  Not least of this camera's features--apart from pixels, lens versatility, shot stability and auto settings--is its video capability.  Other cameras shoot HD at 780p and at erratic speeds; the Canon 110 captures video at 1080p at 24fps (standard movie speed), and with surprisingly sensitive and spacious sound from its built-in stereo microphone.The question may occur to many: why is Amazon selling this apparently below their cost?  Some plausible ponderings are as follows: 1. It's possible the economy is weakening to the point of making a serious dent in \"consumer motivation.\"  Certainly a price drop such as this should bump a few more potential buyers in the right direction.  2. Amazon is the most consumer-friendly operation on the internet, routinely selling good products below their  cost (e.g. the Kindle Fire HD) to maintain market dominance (\"loss leaders\" drum up business and moreover lead to additional purchases--the reason your neighborhood drug store has a continually rotating \"sale\" on various brands of alkaline batteries).  3. Camera sales as a group are beginning to lag, especially now that programs on the new iPhone and iPod Touch 5 boast \"cameras\" so sophisticated they can instantaneously concoct a near-flawless photo out of 3 flawed attempts.  If so, the currently posted price for the Canon Elph 110 may be just enough to remind former camera fans that the dedicated, single-purpose mechanical devices worthy of the designation \"camera\" are far from obsolete.  (Pointing a weightless, thin iPod Touch 5 at a subject feels like holding a credit card in front of their face and saying \"cheese.\"  It seems the device should have some sort of written directions: \"This IS A CAMERA\"!  Moreover, depressing the non-existent, \"virtual\" trigger of an iPod Touch-screen \"camera\" simply doesn't afford the picture-taker anything like the pleasure and satisfaction of using the real deal, regardless of the finished result.  There's no balance, no steadiness, no optical (as opposed to digital) adjustments.  In short, there's no camera. It's basically a \"program,\" just another \"app.\"If some of us have little incentive to purchase, despite he current offering and its price, the reason can be traced to Canon itself.  We all have little Elves by now. They may be a generation or two old but are still none the worse for wear.  On the other hand, it's soon the season for giving, and there are friends and relatives among us who have yet to discover the joys of a real, authentic, \"material\" camera, which should not be mistaken--not for an instant--for the digital feature that's called a \"camera\" on people's iPods, iPads, and now Kindle Fires.

Hudson \"Fatherhonda\"", "ReviewID": "R2HZXI9MHE60W4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My 1 1/2-year-old Canon 300 HS developed a flaw in mid-September 2012.  The doors covering the lens that are supposed to open when you turn on the camera started getting stuck.  Lubricating the doors with a small amount of light oil didn't help.  I sent the camera to Canon last spring and had them repair the same problem under warranty.  But six months later it has arisen again, and the camera is now out of warranty.  I don't know if it is my fault -- the camera has some tiny dings in the metal donut around the lens -- but it had them back in the spring and they were still on the camera when it was returned to me in working condition.  Because any repair is likely to cost at least $100, or more than half the cost of a replacement, and the problem may still recur, I decided to just buy a new camera.The closest replacement is the Canon 110 HS, $180 at Amazon at the time of my purchase (the 300 HS was nearly $300 when I bought it).  It has a CMOS sensor (important for better low-light pictures), 5x optical zoom, an F2.7 24mm (wide-angle) lens, optical image stabilization, and takes both 720p and 1080p hi-def video, just like the 300 HS.  Where it is different is that although the case is exactly the same size as the 300 HS, the screen is a little larger, it offers what appears to be a lower-compression jpeg storage option ('superfine' versus 'fine,' compared to 'fine' and 'normal' on the 300 HS), it has a 16 megapixel sensor instead of 12, and the battery and charger are different from the ones in previous Canon pocket cameras.I have a minor criticism (and a major one shown below).  Increasing the pixel count is not necessarily a good thing. Having 16 megapixels is silly for a pocket camera that most people use for casual and family photos.  We share photos mostly by email and on sites like Facebook using around 1 megapixel, and you can print a good 4x6 photo with around 1.5 megapixels.  You can even print a good 8x10 with 2.5 or 3 megapixels -- more pixels simply don't show in the print.  Moreover the higher-megapixel pictures take more room on your hard drive and take your computer longer to edit.  The only time I find extra megapixels useful is when I'm stuck with the pocket camera in a superzoom situation and I'm forced to use digital zoom or have to deeply crop the image in the computer.  It doesn't happen very often.  Some people say that putting more megapixels in the same-size sensor leads to more image noise or more aggressive noise reduction, which in turn leads to less-sharp pictures.  This may be true but I have compared photos from my 300 HS with the 110 HS, and have not seen evidence of greater noise or less-sharp images in this camera.In order to mitigate the hard-drive-space problem and reduce processing time I've set the camera to use only 8 megapixels for ordinary photos.  I have a superzoom camera for situations (like sports) where I want a lot of usable pixels in the subject.  At 8 megapixels the 110 HS performs remarkably well.  If the situation warrants, it is easy enough to switch back to 16 megapixels.My major criticism is about the battery and this is the reason for giving the camera only 4 stars.  Canon changed the battery and the charger and they are not compatible with older equipment.  This information is shown in the camera description but I glossed over it -- if I had noticed it I would have considered moving to another brand of camera since my old stock of Canon-compatible batteries and chargers would no longer be useful.  If the new battery (called NB 11L) were larger or had greater capacity than the old, I might regard the change as desirable, but they have in fact moved in the other direction.  There may be some design constraint in the new camera that I don't know about which left less room for a battery.  If so it is not obvious.  I was tempted to return the camera for this reason, but decided to keep it because it is, after all, a very good camera.Update June 2013:  The camera surprised me with one feature.  It takes great low-light photos.  When it is set to 'night shot' the upper range of ISO is opened up, 1600 and 3200.  In a low-light situation it takes a picture, then pauses for a few seconds to process the image.  The result is a clear, sharp image that looks as if it had been taken with a great deal more light.  The noise reduction program in this camera is far more advanced than the one in my PC-based image editor.  The image is not trashed!  I tried a more expensive camera, a Nikon P330, in similar low-light situations, and was disappointed in the results.

I've been using it since November 2012 - in auto mode and in program mode to attempt to improve situations where it is not performing well.The biggest problem is FOCUS.  It attempts to focus on everything BUT your subject.  Moving the camera and/or half pressing the button usually does not help.  In landscapes it focuses on a tree instead of building, a building instead of a tree, a tree instead of another tree, etc.  An example of how bad the focus is - I was photographing my brown dog - attempting to focus on his face while he napped on a cream blanket.  Instead of picking up his face, it kept focusing on his brown side or haunch or even the cream blanket  - basically an expanse of brown or cream with no distinguishing marks.Low light - Photos are always blurry.  And by low light I mean any photo taken indoors without flash if the subject is not PERFECTLY stationary.  You can have all the lights on or all the curtains open and have some beautiful natural light, but to this camera it may as well be night time.  Of course if you use the flash, it helps.  But the flash is a horrible strobe that lights up your subject in a very unnatural way.  I've tried covering \u00bd of it with my thumb or taping a piece of tissue over the flash to act as a filter.  This helps somewhat.  Mostly I only use the flash if I am standing WAAAY back with the camera zoomed to the max.Depth of field in a photo - I have found it almost impossible to get that nice blurry look behind a subject.  Doesn't matter if I zoom or not or if there is distance between the subject and the background.  I have to depend on editing software which is time consuming.Macro is terrible - most time it cannot focus on a close subject when on macro.  Seems to actually work better when not on macro - go figure!The only good thing I can say is that the video function is nice - the one step record is handy and the videos are pretty good.Oh and I've dropped it twice this week in the snow and it still works.  Not sure if thats a pro or con.  May be my subconscious hoping it dies!I miss my ancient boxy Kodak CX7430 with the postage stamp sized screen.  It took great photographs in all of the above situations.Back to the drawing board...", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing capability in a tiny package, with some quirks", "Author": "Donald Wulfinghoff \"author, Energy Efficiency...", "ReviewID": "R1SRHJ67OBXOLO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace a Canon ELPH 300 HS, essentially similar, which became defective after 15 months and several thousand photos.My main criterion originally was the very wide field of vision, which is about as wide as you will find in compact camera.  The picture quality is good.  It is very good in low light.  The tiny flash is remarkably effective, but it is easy to get a finger in front of it.  Color balance (\"white balance\") is good, and is selected automatically for the light source.  Beyond that, you can set the color balance manually.The range of capabilitie is enormous, and it will take you a while to learn to use them.  It is a point-and-shoot camera, but if you press the wrong buttons, it may take a while to figure out how to restore the camera to operating the way you want.The package is very small and light, easily carried in a pocket.The main caution is the auto-focus, which can be slow under certain lighting conditions.  We discovered this with our previous ELPH, when we noted that some pictures had a degraded resolution, while usually the pictures were sharp.  The solution is to press the shutter release partially until the camera has finished auto-focusing, and only then press the rest of the way.The lens has some barrel distortion, especially at the widest angles.  This means that the center of the image bulges outward somewhat.  This is most noticeable in pictures involvings straight lines, such as the sides of buildings.If you buy the camera, get a couple of extra batteries.  The battery type is unusual, and you will need at least one spare on a long outing.  The camera comes with an appropriate battery charger.The camera does not come with a case.

I'm not a photographer, but I'm decent when it comes to taking pictures and what to expect. I wasn't expected anything amazing from a point and shoot camera, but I do feel this camera could be a little better.Things I Love About This Camera:- It doesn't take long to turn on the camera and start taking pictures, which I think is really nice.- The HD videos are really nice. I've uploaded a couple to Youtube and you will get the full 1080p resolution as stated. The color in the videos are vibrant, and everything looks great. The audio quality is decent.- It's size is nice. It isn't a hassle to take around with you, which I've been taking it everywhere with me.- It feels like a quality product, expect for the door you open and close to remove/ put in the battery and SD card.Dislikes:- The picture quality wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The pictures aren't blurry, but they're not crisp neither. I feel that it's good at focusing on some things, while it loses quality near the edges of a picture, and I'm not talking about macro neither.- Not having an auto focus feature, for reasons stated above.- I'm not known for having big fingers, but I feel like the buttons are a little hard to push, you have to use more of the tip of your finger to really hit the button.- I don't like that it doesn't come with an SD card, but I assume that's common when purchasing a digital camera.I did a lot of research on this camera before I purchased it, and I only bought it because it was supposed to be one of the \"best point and shoot camera's\" available, but I disagree. I should have looked around a little more before settling on this camera.

I was looking for a camera for my mother for her 93rd birthday that was simple to use, took great pictures, and was not too expensive. My mother has dementia and anything more complicated that pushing one or two buttons is too much for her to remember at this point. I personally have a couple of cameras including a DSLR and the Canon G15, but I am by no means a photographic expert. At any rate, I had my reservations on teaching her how to use a \"new fangled camera\". I have to say, I was really impressed by the quality of the pictures taken by my mother. I taught her only the on/off button and the button to press to take pictures. Granted we got a lot of pictures of the floor, the kitchen table, and the ceiling, but I finally got across to her that she had to see the picture to be taken on the screen before taking a picture. Forget focusing and pressing half way on the button to focus before taking pictures. I was lucky to have her press the right button at all. I could not believe that not one picture was blurred or out of focus. I printed some of the pictures she took, and they came out perfectly. She was thrilled!! I am hoping that this camera will be a new interest and start a learning process for her. If she can take wonderful pictures with this camera, imagine what can be done with it when the user knows what they are doing.

That is the only gripe about the camera to me as it would confuse users of say the 300 HS who might want a replacement or another copy that this is actually the upgraded version. But once you get over that fact its a great little camera.The 300 HS was a wonderful compact camera that took great photos and videos. I had a Canon Rebel DSLR and a HD Camcorder but lugging both around and switching back and forth between the two was a bit much... so i was at best buy one day and though to myself woudnt it be great to find a smaller camera that could take good pictures and HD videos. and thats when i found the 300 HS which has remarkably well image stabilzation (you can walk with the camera while videoing and it remains rather steady considering) and the image quality for photos was a step above most other smaller cameras and video quality was very well too (even inside with less light)The 110 HS is slightly larger but actually lighter then the 300 HS but has a slightly larger screen (3.0 vs 2.7 inch) and a better image processer, the diffrences ive seen so far is the colors seem to be a tad better, macro focus seems to do better a bit too,  and it might seem to be a tad more stable when moving with video..the difference honestly to me is not worth a upgrade if you have a 300 HS already as it would do you just fine but if you need a replacement or need to get another copy for youreslf or a family or friend.. this would be it.and you might say well why get this if cell phone cameras (which this is not too much bigger then a cell phone) can take videos and pictures too? Lets be honest most cell phone cameras are sub par compared to pretty much any decent compact stand alone camera thas how they save a bit of money if they shoved a 200 buck camera inside of a cell phone it would cost more.  The 110 HS will beat images and videos id say even by the Ipad 3 or iphone 5 simply because this was built from the ground up as a photo/video solution.  Cell phone cameras are great for sharing stuff with friends but if you want quality that is not as detailed as a pro camera but better then the average \"consumer\" camera this would be a good match.  which to me makes it useful for photographers as well. just because its a compact doesnt mean you really have to compromise too much (unless you are into manual settings) but i have found using a DSLR vs this camera this one is actually a lot easier to use simply because for the most part its auto mode works perfect, even my canon Rebel XTi had problems with yellowing pictures inside with no flash on auto mode, i usually rarely ever had that problem with the 300 HS and from what i seen so far same with the 110 HS. so think about that. this camera has a better auto mode then some 600 buck DSLR cameras(now i am not saying that for the current Canon DSLR cameras i would hope they would have an updated auto mode too as time has passed)but basically all you need to do with this camera is point and shoot and frame the image right and you'll get great photos that will wow your friends! and great video as well!and the plus with the video as with the Canon 110 HS is the video mode is true 24p which for videographers is a nice plus because it will make the videos look a tad step up from the average compact camera video!also one tip if you have a HD TV or a widescreen 16:9 computer moniter you can set the photos to 16:9 which will make them fit when viewed back on those displays easily (or if you want to integrate them into your HD video using a video editor too!) it can also shoot in other aspect ratios which makes the options nice.also of note the slow motion mode (i didnt test it on here but it should be the same as the 300 HS) is really fun as well!for the size and price you really cant go wrong with this camera, just one suggestion is to get a nice little case for it (the one thats listed with the product underneath works great) to keep it safe and thats what I should have got for my last one haha :-)Somehow i think even though its only just a bit better then the 300 HS its going to inspire to do more video and photos :-) and with the holidays coming up this is the best time to get it!", "Date": "September 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic, simple camera", "Author": "mary_h", "ReviewID": "R33BS4C5YJ1F3L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't say how pleased I am with this camera.

Only issues i have are 1) i accidentally push the \"Off\" button instead of the shutter button, maybe my fingers are too big, and 2) i was putting my finger on the tiny microphone hole and so the resulting videos were nosy and muted until i figured it out. Now i have to hold the camera to not cover the hole.

After looking back at everything I found most Cameras bellow $250 will be around 3X-8X Optical zoom. I sometimes need to film things from a reasonable distance away, maybe 220 feet, which the 5X Optical seems to be reasonable enough for. If you need to film from a 200+ feet away often and are going to be picky at how close you need it to be zoomed in on the actually item itself then your best option will be to look into a Camcorder as they tend to have a ridiculous amount of optical zoom.)Conclusion:All in all the camera is a great choice whether you want a perfect photo or a beautiful video within 200 feet.

For super compacts this camera can't be beat.Overall, if you want a super compact camera with tons of features, easy to use and at a great price this is the camera for you.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good camera, but...", "Author": "SDET \"", "ReviewID": "RAH88KBXQ8FRJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": null, "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "puma", "ReviewID": "RT5DAWJRZBDJE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recieved it quicker than expected.

I took a few low light shots and they have turned out well enough for a point and shoot.Pros:Picture quality is great for a point and shoot.There are a lot of menu settings that allow you to tweak photos and add different effects.It is small and lightweight.It is simple to use if you've owned other Canon point and shoots before. The menu systems are similar, etc.The tripod mount is near the middle, so the camera can be mounted on a small tripod without tipping one way.Cons:I've noticed that the flash is poorly placed. If you use the flash there's a small bit of the photo near the lower right corner that is dark because of the flash placement. If you use a wider angle than needed the dark spot can be cropped out.I haven't really tested the video yet other than viewing a video on camera. When I get time I'll make a video and load it on the computer to test the quality. There are plenty of test videos on YouTube that show the quality.So far this camera has performed above average as far as the other point and shoots I've owned. I have a Powershot Elph SD1000 that I bought about 5 years ago and my first digital Canon was the Powershot Elph SD100. I have been pleased with all of my Canon camera purchases.

I would highly recommend this camera for someone looking to get a small camera to carry on a daily basis. I will update if I feel I have anything else to add to this review.Edit: I upgraded from 4 to 5 stars because I found that you can change the ISO if you choose program mode. So the only fault I have found with the camera is the flash issue. I would recommend purchasing a 16g class 10 SD card if you want to take video.

However, the sound when zooming in during video is noticeable. Also, there is a big brown curved shadow at the bottom right hand corner when using the flash. I called Canon and they said this is a known issue because the flash is close to the lens. I've seen this happen in other cameras but not to this extent. The shadow is very big and noticeable.

At first, the ELPH 110 HS looked comparable in quality and function; until I started using it in a variety of daily use situations.The performance from push of the button to actual photo taken is sluggish. Indoor, low light photos are often blurred; especially if someone so much as twitches before the flash. Even though this camera has a dedicated movie button, which is definitely a convenience, the movies are stored in .mov format which is like taking a step back to the early 2000's in video storage and transfer. Cannon needs to stick with .avi and .mpg formats like most of their other cameras.The poor battery life of this camera is inexcusable. My PowerShot 3100 IS camera could go for days of constant use, or weeks of casual use without needing charged. This camera burned through a full battery pack charge before my daughter's 3 hour birthday party was finished; and I had to switch to my 2 year old Droid X phone to finish taking photos. By the way, I got better over all photos from my 5.0 megapixel camera phone than I did the ELPH 110 HS.If all you plan to do is take photos and video in highly lit areas, where people are staged and not moving, this camera will get you by. If you plan on capturing photos of your kids and family playing, at their soccer or baseball game, or in un-staged situations; you're better off leaving this camera on the shelf.UPDATE: Less than a month after taking this camera out of the box, and having only taken about 100 pictures, I had to take it back. The camera lost the ability to auto focus when trying to zoom in on subjects. This model of camera is just too poorly designed and manufactured to suit even my most basic photography needs.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for my aspiring Photographer", "Author": "Gary P Turner", "ReviewID": "R1E1KFO51U8YEH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My daughter wanted a compact camera to carry with her all the time.

(Canon used to have very good A-series cameras with optical viewfinders but they cheapened out the A-series when they created the G and the SX lines.)  Yes, you can get a longer zoom like on Canon PowerShot SX260 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Image Stabilized Zoom 25mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full-HD Video (Black) which is a very good travel cam.  But when you can't really see what's happening on the sunlit-washed LCD most other camera features are candy.I bought this camera to travel with for a trip this summer.  I also have a great micro 4/3rd camera with an electronic VIEWFINDER Panasonic DMC-G5KK 16 MP Compact System Camera with 14-42mm Zoom Lens and 3-Inch LCD (Black) but I'm not packing that into the Amazon jungle.  The Elph 110 is my travel cam, small enough to fit into a Pelican waterproof case, and cheap enough that I won't cry is something happens to it.The camera features are pretty good.  This is pretty basic, no optical viewfinder, no shutter priority (Tv/S) or aperature priority (Av/A) modes.  You have limited but adequate settings for a tiny P&S.;  The color rendition is pretty good.  The camera is fairly well laid out.  Ergonomically though this model does not have a spinning mode dial like on the SX160 and other Canons.  This means moving through the menu system is SLOW.  The buttons are inlaid on the back body which is good making it unlikely you will hit them by accident.  But having them indented AND no spinning mode means you spend way too much time changing settings.  And the menu button itself is tiny.  With the word Menu below, not on the button, you may find yourself pressing in the wrong place.Based on images posted on the Internet before my purchase I was concerned about image sharpness.  If you go to the Canon website and look at the sample photo for this camera of the girl with red hair, you will have a very hard time finding out what is actually in focus and what is sharp.  That image on the Canon site is very fuzzy and not a great representation of what you can get with this camera.  From shots I've taken image sharpness is adequate but may vary based on individual unit within the same model.  My photos look fine but many of those from this model camera on flickr, amazon, and elsewhere on the Internet do not look that sharp.  There is a sharpness setting in my colors/custom that can boost the results.The largest IQ problem with this camera is that it tends to overexpose by 1/3 - 2/3 stop when used outdoors.  This might just be a problem with my copy but it does show up in a good percentage of photos.  Shooting outdoors would be the first thing I would check after getting this camera.  You can adjust through EV overrides and by trying out different scene modes.  But seriously this kind of problem should not be present in any modern P&S.;Summary:  If you want a small very pocketable P&S;, don't need a long zoom range, and can live without a viewfinder, this is one of the best picks at currently ~$150 as of this review.  If you want a longer zoom then Canon PowerShot SX160 IS 16.0 MP Digital Camera with 16x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 3.0-Inch LCD (Black) or Canon PowerShot SX260 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Image Stabilized Zoom 25mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full-HD Video (Black) would be the next steps up both in IQ, size, functions, and zoom.Competition:  I had looked at the Sony and Panasonic models and done alot of research online.  I spent some time with the Sony and Canon models at Target.  I use dpreview.com and the jpeg image comparison and go to center and all the corners of the photos to get an idea.  I also use imaging-resource.com and look at their images in detail.  Early on I thought I was going to get a Panasonic as all my other cameras are Panasonic.  But I don't care for the latest Panasonic menus and some very hit and miss IQ and handling across the lower end of their line these days.  I like Sony menu's better but don't care for Sony ergonomics.  In P&S; I think Canon is currently doing the best job in providing a variety of good models.  And Canon's IQ on the lower end has really improved in the past few years.  (One exception is the Elph 300 which has very poor corner sharpness, almost increadibly bad).", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the features, hate the problems", "Author": "Julie K", "ReviewID": "R2ALBHIX8753ZX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love this camera, unfortunately it keeps coming up with 'lens error, camera shuts down automatically'.

Let me use my usual disclaimer, in the interest of fairness, and admit that many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the whole picture.The ELPH110 is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 16.1 resolution (megapixels), and a x5 zoom. The sensor size is 1/2.3 inch CCD-type, which is standard for cameras of its class.If you were to, say, take pictures of friends and family at an outdoor gathering, this camera is what you need. If you get ambitious, there will be stumbling blocks. Here is the camera's trait mix: It does not have a viewfinder, which, again, many in its class don't. The ISO rating, which is the gauge for how well it does in low light, is 3200. That rating is lower than many others, but it is sufficient for most purposes. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. It does not have a hot shoe for an external flash option. That is not unexpected for its size and category. The LCD screen is a 461,000 resolution. The camera does not do RAW processing but you would need only if you did not want to be limited by JPEG type storage. The burst rate is a fast 5.8- great for quick shots. The weight of the camera is a convenient 133 grams.Overall, nice, fun camera. Having been into photography for a while, I do stress though that you do a camera trait search. That will also tell you more about what you want.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cannon Powershot", "Author": "Douglas Field", "ReviewID": "R3C21HG6G6SS4O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great in that it is lightweight and super compact.

I had 3 digital Kodaks, one Sony (over $300 and no good for my needs) and now this is my 4th Canon. Such a good product for my needs.I have a lot of different needs that I expect out of my camera:1. Photos of knitting... up close, detail shots for the web and for print.2. Stills of dancers and musicians (extreme lighting and moving targets3. Video of people on stage, dancers & musicians4. Video for my art/knitting business... up close instruction videos of my hands, and video of my face (like a video podcast).The up sides:1. Regular USB connector and SD card, can be connected with normal non-proprietary methods to most laptops/computers.2. Very good detail shots (better to take them from a yard/meter away and then use zoom than position the camera too close)3. Microphone is pretty good for instructional video.4. Lots of settings (they can be confusing but once understood they can help to correct lighting or adjust a bit to movement).Down sides:1. Moving people on stage are more than a small camera like this is made for. The best one I had for this was, believe it or not, the Kodak I had in late 2004 which had a \"sports\" setting and not as many megapixels. I do get good shots with this but need to take about 10-12 photos that blur before I get one good one. It does help to hold the button halfway down to focus ahead of the time you actually click it down for the exposure.2. Playback of the video has no sound/speaker. You can see it play back but to listen you need to put the file on another gizmo.3. I was using avidemux to edit my videos from the previous Canon I had. This one uses a \"better\" newfangled format even when not at highest definition, and it makes editing the file in Avidemux choppy and impossible to finesse. Big disappointment.4. I set up the camera one day to record my mother teaching a group of people, then went to listen with the rest of them. At the point where the video file reaches a certain file size, it stops and saves. You have to then restart recording a new file, losing some content. I didn't realize this so I lost a bunch of her talk. :-{ Next time I may try a lower resolution to get more time before the recording stops.I read enough reviews to be sure to get the SanDisk Extreme SDHC UHS-1 Class 10 Memory Card B004P1V8TM to go with it.

I have lugged it up mountain trails, packed it into waterproof bags and taken it downstream, and missed lots of shots while tugging it out.

So, I bought an ELPH 110, which I proceeded to somehow lose on my first hike with it. SO, I came right back to Amazon and shelled out the money for another...and a better case, with a carbiner clip.That was in May 2013...and that camera was wonderful. I captured images and video of my kids' kindergarten and 8th grade graduations that was, at least aesthetically, as good as my DSLR--it certainly captured more light in low-light settings. The video feature is great; I loaded clips easily onto a DVD, and made some memorable summer films. I took neat nature shots with the macro lens, experimented with the B&W; and color saturation features, and logged a daily vacation journal with crisp, clear photos. I carried it in my purse and left it on the kitchen counter--it has served exactly the purpose I intended and more. Then, while rushing to get outside and take a photo of a friend goofing off,  I dropped it on a hardwood floor--hard. Cracked the screen, jammed the lens. There is no fixing this mess.

I was looking for a replacement and did quite a bit of research before settling on this model (Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS). Most of the reviews for this model were very positive. I ran an online comparison between it and several other models and brands. I wanted a point & shoot because it's easier for me to use. (I have a form of rheumatoid arthritis) This camera is smaller than anything I've owned before, but I absolutely love it. One of the features that has impressed me and caught my eye on other reviews is the wide angle lens it possesses. This allows more light into each shot and the pictures I've taken so far have been impressive. They are crisp, clear, and the colors are extremely vivid. It's very similar to the Canon 3100 I owned, so figuring out how to use it has been a breeze.If you are looking for a great point & shoot that takes clear shots with relative ease, this is the camera for you.

Image quality is great. My only complaint about this camera is that the lens is too big and heavy for the body of the camera. The lens creates a small shadow in the corner of the image because it blocks some of the flash when shooting. This happens especially when using the macro setting because you are closer to the subject of the image. Also, if you set the camera down in between shots (which I do for taking retail pictures, constantly rearranging the products or backgrounds for different shots) it will topple over on the lens even on a flat surface.

This Elph, however, fits all my needs. The lens is extremely sharp and the sensor captures very fine details. Even highly magnified, the image looks like a crisp photograph, not a smeary watercolor. The operating controls are well thought out and easy to use. I don't know if this camera is being closed out, but I found one new for under $115. I suggest you get one while they're still available.

I wanted a small camera with a 24 mm wide angle lens and fast f/2.7 aperture which I could slip in my jeans pocket when I am hiking. It has a 16 mp sensor which gives images great detail and can be enlarged while retaining sharpness. High ISO images lose a little detail, but for my photography I want detail at normal ISO. It's just something you accept when you pack 16mp onto a small sensor; high ISO noise. It's not noticeable until you are at 800 ISO and above. The images are sharp and colors vibrant. It also goes beyond auto mode and enables the user more control in program mode. Battery life was criticized, but I find the battery life quite acceptable. If a larger battery was used that would necessitate a larger profile camera which isn't why I chose this particular p&s.;The full HD video is beautiful and has a dedicated button to turn it on and the zoom can be used when using the video. Canon is the accepted leader in point and shoot cameras and this Elph 110 hs reinforced that fact very well.

The Canon Elph 110 surpasses both cameras mentioned above when it comes to taking pictures in low light.  This may be that the flash seems a bit brighter but I never compared the three together.  I believe the Lumix comes in 3rd place here for me since it took blurry pics and the quality/color was not as detailed as the Nikon since I took comparison pictures between these two cameras.

Have been using a Nikon L20 for some years and figured I needed an up grade. I'm very happy with this buy. Have compared on Snapsort and the L20 got a 25 & the Canon 110HS got a 63. Seems to be a nice buy if what you are looking for is a good clear picture. I didn't need and don't want GPS or touch screen etc. I compared the other ELPH cameras with the 110HS and they didn't rate as well. Why spend hundreds more for a camera that does not take as nice of pictures. I figure if it works out of the box on the 1st charge it should be a good one. I have read where they were dead out of the box. Seems this is how everything is made these days. Sort of a crap shoot. Was looking at the S100 Canon but by the looks of them there is something wrong. They came out at $495 a year ago and are as low as $245. The S95 is still $350 or more. Is this telling us that the S95 is a better camera?

My only real dissapointment is that pictures of people, particularly grandkids, do not appear sharp.  Too much emphasis is put on camera shake, and consequently the use of high Iso settings to decrease exposure time.  The noise is very noticible if flash is not activated.  Having used point and shoot cameras before, and comparing the ELPH 110 HS to a Lumix SZ7, I feel the 4 stars I gave the ELPH is appropriate, and it is a nice addition to my camera family.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good point and shoot", "Author": "Steven T. Kearney \"roguetrex\"", "ReviewID": "R21M2Q6VG8P6S7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In planning a trip to Disney World I was looking for a replacement (for my older Elph 750 from about 6 years ago) that had HD video capabilities and optical image stabilization. My Droid cell phone was unreliable, and takes too long to start up (not to mention the fact that it rarely saves the footage correctly). Canon has a great history and reputation, so I purchased this 2 days before our trip.Positives:-This is an excellent point-and-shoot camera, especially for snapshots of people.  The wide angle lens really makes it easy to quickly frame up.  It also lets you stand fairly close to the subjects, which is a real treat (I kept thinking I would need to take the standard \"3-step-drop\" back to fit everyone in the frame, but I can't remember doing that once.-HD Video quality for the most part is gorgeous and wonderful, even in some lower-light settings (see negatives below for some less-great things about the Video Quality).  For a point and shoot that can fit in your pocket, I am very impressed.  For the most part, the best advice is to keep it zoomed out wide, and you'll love the images.-Great photos, especially in daylightNegatives:-It takes some time to focus sometimes (mainly in moderately low light, but sometimes in normal lighting).  When it does auto focus, it is quick and precise, but when it doesn't quickly lock on it has taken about 7-10 seconds of me repeatedly trying the shutter button half-way down for it to \"lock\" focus correctly. Again, this doesn't happen often, but maybe every 100-or-so shots it will, and it isn't a problem I've had with many cameras.-Standard battery leaves a lot to  be desired.  I purchased a 3.6V and 900mAh Wasabi replacement battery, which is now my standard.  If you're planning to be out taking photos (and, especially, videos) for a full day, I would recommend purchasing (2) of these replacements, and carry the standard battery as final backup.  I found it under $14, and have seen them under $10.-With HD Video, it takes a very long time to focus once you're recording. I learned quickly to let the camera focus (just like when taking a photo) before you start recording.  Sounds obvious, but if you want to record a moment quickly, its worth holding off for that last second while the camera focuses, because once you are recording it is slow to re-focus.-With such a wide lens and the optical image stability I was disappointed at the number of photos that were blurred.  That is somthing that I was hoping to avoid, and I took small measures to try an avoid that, but I expected a greater improvement from my old Elph from years ago with no IS.Miscelaneous-The zoom is fairly slow once recording video, but that isn't a huge detriment.  Just something to know going in.Bottom line, for a $130 camera, this is a real bargain.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "So Far, So Good!", "Author": "Laura T.", "ReviewID": "R2Y6F7YE937TVG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far, I'm really loving this camera.

First the negatives. I found the controls to be confusing and difficult to navigate, particuloarly in sunlight.  it is hard to tell what mode you are in and the screen gets filled with icons, most of which are unintelligible.  It is very small, which is good, but also very easy to drop, which is bad.  I found that you always have to use the wrist strap, otherwise you risk disaster.  I also found that the lens is very prone to flare, which in some cases ruined my scenic shots.Now for the positives:  it is small and convenient, fits in the pocket and always there when you need it.  It takes excellent snapshots, and works very well in low light.  The flash is powerful enough for most situations, but because of the high ISOs available, I found I often didn't need the flash and was able to get beautiful natural light photos.  Lens resolution, for a camera of this size is excellent, and the natural rendition of color is great.  I also found that the high resolution (full HD) movies you can take with the ELPH are far better than I expected,  better, in fact, than I shoot with my SLR.On balance, I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants to take great snapshots, and wants convenience, great color, and high resolution.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Quality Pics and Easy to Use!", "Author": "Shelly S", "ReviewID": "R1P9VGPL6EQA6T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned several point and shoot cameras and this by far is the best one I have owned.

I actually bought 2 of them for x-mas gifts.Keeping in mind that they were not real expensive cameras, I didn't expect anything too extraordinary.  After arriving, I checked them both out to make sure they worked good before x-mas.  The batteries actually charged quicker than I expected (about 2 hours).  The cameras do not come with a memory card, which I knew, so I bought one with the camera.  I played with the features briefly and took a few pics.  The auto focus worked good, and the pics seemed pretty clear.  The zoom worked good indoors.  I don't know how it would work outside zooming on something far away...  my trial shots were taken indoors.  There is a small delay between pushing the button and when the pic is actually taken, plus another small delay before the pic is shown on the viewing screen.If you want a camera with a real quick response time, this one is not for you.However, as a x-mas gift for 2 teenage boys, this camera should be more than sufficient.  Especially since I got them for around $130 each.Also, since this camera does not take regular batteries, I bought an extra for each camera.  If the battery for the camera dies, it would be good to have a 2nd one charged and ready to go.  Even though they charge fairly quick, a 2nd would be very handy, and they are not that expensive...  I got a charger and 2 batteries for around $20.A little slow on taking and showing pics...  wish it took regular AA bateries...  wish it came with a memory card....Overall, a good camera for the novice photographer (a.k.a. teenagers).

Picture quality extremely sharp.  Colors very good.  Not a pro camera by any means -- and low light performance is OK but not as good as what could be had with a larger and more expensive rig -- but overall, a brilliant compromise for the small size and light weight.

Let's cover some territory first -- this is NOT a professional DSLR that would be used for a photo shoot for the cover of Vogue magazine.  This is a 'point & shoot' camera designed for convenience & good picture quality, especially in the hands of someone who knows how to make the best of lighting.Having said that, I wish I would have bought another older 1100HS.  I purchased this one b/c of the reviews & the mistake I made was thinking it would be a modern day version of the older one.  Boy was that a mistake!!  I absolutely despise this camera!!  In a nutshell:-The battery life is bad-Scrolling around is difficult because of the design of the 'cursor wheel'-VIDEO MODE IS HORRIBLE!!!  THE CAMERA KEEPS TRYING TO AUTO FOCUS WHENEVER THE IT IS POINTED AT A DIFFERENT SUBJECT RENDERING THE ENTIRE VIDEO BLURRY & OUT OF FOCUS!!!  Sure it might be 1080p but who cares if it is 10 million 'P' if the whole video is out of focus??-Another thing about 1080p -- when the camera is set in that mode, you might get 2.5 - 3 minutes of video on a 2 Gig card.  Forget using SDHC cards b/c the video format will be unreadable... I found out the hard way!  Precious memories that were attempted to be captured with this camera on video have been lost to \"video error-dom\"!-The battery does not fit in other Canon Elph chargers.  This is more of a trivial point but I was hoping to be able to use the charger from my old Canon Elph to charge the battery for this camera simply for the sake of convenience but the size of the battery is different & the battery contact points are in a different location....therefore the battery/charger is not backwards compatible.. two thumbs down!!!If you are considering purchasing a compact camera for photo & some video use, look elsewhere & DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mostly good with some complaints", "Author": "David F.

Things I didn't like:1. The videos I took underwater were noisy in that every time you zoomed you heard the sound of the zoom which took away from watching the video.  If only they had gotten rid of that sound pickup!2. The flash is a bit too close to the top of the camera so it's easy to partially block it when holding it. I had to tell others using it to take a picture of us to not block the flash.3. In Underwater mode, Auto ISO jumps to very high ISO numbers which keep the shutter speed high.  This did enable me to capture many moving shots of fish and sea lions but they ended up quite grainy.  I wish they revised it to back off one stop of ISO raising (I ended up getting many shots with ISO of 800, 900, 1000, 1600).  I didn't need quite the high speed chosen.

If I'm going to be shooting action, birds in flight, anything moving fast, the DSLR is obviously much more suited for the job. Thing is, I can't lug a big DSLR everywhere and sometimes it's nice to have something uber incognito. The Elph 110HS does that.Image quality is pretty good for a point and shoot, at least up to about ISO 800. ISO 1600 is a little noisy and, although it likes to be at ISO 3200 indoors, the image quality at that ISO is noisy. The video shooting is also pretty good, although don't try to pan too fast or the resulting video will give you motion sickness.I only have a few issues with the camera. There is no way to manually set aperture or shutter speed (with the exception of \"long shutter\" mode).

I realized every photo I took with the flash ON emits a dark shadowy patch towards the right-bottom side of the image. If you think this camera takes absolutely great photos, you're right! Pictures with lots of natural lighting and/or outdoor scenes without using the 'flash', yes, but double-check your photos by taking some indoor shots with the flash ON and preferably with lighter backgrounds and you will see what I mean. I didn't think it was a big deal if it didn't hurt the actual images, but all the photos I transferred to my laptop had the problem -- a dark fuzzy, shadowy blotch towards the bottom right! I tried every settings until my thumb got sore from pressing the 'flushed' setting buttons but nothing helped. Then I realized this was caused by the positioning of the flash lens. The Canon had the flash located on the left side of the camera (right side if you're viewing a pic of the product) and when the camera is turned ON, the lens extends and therefore blocking a quarter of the light when the flash is activated. I tried taking a few shots with my left index finger 'doubling' as extending the lens from the Canon and every shot I took with my finger extended, the shadow increases more and more on the bottom-right of the screen. Note that I didn't cover any part of the lens but only slightly blocking a portion of the light from the flash and therefore created this mystery shadow. This further validated my claim and assured of the culprit. The only way to remedy this is to zoomed in the lens a bit.Images looked fabulous when shot outdoors w/o the flash but I noticed that it also inherited some linear distortion and field curvature (barrel effect) on most of my photos, in other words cars looks stretched toward the edges of photos, light poles are bent in, and rounded objects like my wall clock looked oval. I believed most cameras with wide-angle lenses emits this effect. But overall, the camera takes takes more than satisfactory photos. It has great color-balance and very little noise. Close-up viewing (1:1) is still very good without revealing too much noise or artifacts.Regarding the black spot, I am really hoping that this is a defect with the model I received. The camera has been returned and I repurchased another one. I will update the review should there be any noticeable differences or improvement.Cons:1.) The power button: Yes, THE BUTTON (instead of a sliding switch) this causes me to accidentally turned the camera on and off whenever storing or removing from its case. This also happens during removal of the SD card and battery (for charging) vice versa.2.) Menu setting buttons: Works great but they are stiff! Not very easy and doesn't provide much of a tactile feel because they are 'flushed' throughout the panel. My right thumb literally got sore from operating this camera when selecting options or previewing photos.3.) Battery/SD card release cover is flimsy. Sliding it back and forth will certainly grind off the little tabs which will eventually leave it hanging.4.) Zoom (video): Emits a wheezing sound when used rendering your precious materials virtually useless.5.) Battery life: Short!6.) Noticeable Linear Distortion and Field Curvature.Pros:1.) Very compact, light and stylish2.) Wide angle lens3.) Great outdoor photos, or when flash is not in use for indoor photos.4.) Night shots are very good and retaining rich colors such as red.5.) Great HD Video with Stereo recording6.) Separate/external battery charger (can also be charge from computer by using the same USB cable, but much slower).7.)

I should have known there would be issues if even dpreview.com or kenrockwell.com didn't review this camera. Both give the Powershot S110 a great review.

We appreciate the opportunity to assist you with your PowerShot ELPH 110 HS.We understand that you are noticing a noise being recorded when zooming during video capture.  Due to the compact nature of the camera the lens is located close to the microphone used to record audio.  Some noise to be expected when zooming during recording.

The 24mm lens is a great wide angle, especially for video, which I must say is incredible for the price.

included in the box, I made this video for you!This is my all-time favorite portable camera on market! While I got it predominantly for video recording, the pictures aren't bad as they are much better than any cell phone camera out today. I can't comment too much on the photo quality of this camera because I mostly use this cam for video, but the 110 HS is a quality purchase. The video quality is full HD 1080p at 24fps which gives it a nice film look with it's sharp depth of field and wide angle lens. The wide angle lens is great for 'vlogging' (video blogging) because it captures your entire frame as you hold the camera at arms length.

I recharged the battery again for a very long time because I thought it just needed a fully recharged battery. Sadly, even then, the camera is still slow for me. For regular uses (i.e., taking pictures of people, scenery, etc) it might be okay. But I take pictures of my dogs and before it snaps the shot, my dogs have already moved. My old Canon PowerShot SD700 IS from 8 years ago took pictures in rapid successions. Also, the camera itself is Made in Malaysia and I prefer Made in Japan.

It simply does not take good photos. This is even more pronounced when there is backlighting, as in, shooting near an outdoor window. You get white light spots but the subject of the photos is dimmed out. I've tried running around turning on lights in the house to get a good shot, but between that and the shooting delay, the moment is usually gone that i was trying to capture.I hate to say it, but at this point the camera is permanently in a drawer in favor of the instant camera phone.

It requires an additional flash memory card.  And I don't recall that being mentioned in the camera's advertisement/description.  This was confirm to me by Cannon customer support (very polite and helpful) after I fumbled around with the camera for several days.  One would think the camera would have a minimal amount of built-in memory, at least enough to take a few pictures, but not so.The other annoyance I had was the software that accompanies the camera.  I have yet to figure out how to print a photo smaller than a full page.  I've checked through the cannon software and if it's there, it's not obvious... at least to me.  I had no problem using a third party applications though, so not a major problem.Ultimately, the photo quality is great and the camera is easy to use.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "canon camera", "Author": "Gordon Baker", "ReviewID": "R2ASTATNNOKF4C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is much more complicated to operate than I would have realized.

This unit appears to take really nice pictures when you look at the LCD preview on the back, but when you blow up the pictures, they are grainy and noisy.The manual that comes with the camera is incomplete and not very helpful.  You'll have to print out a more detailed manual on the included CD.  Virtually none of the special features and modes of the camera are revealed in the minimalist printed manual.The camera's response time is not bad but could be improved upon.  There is still a noticeable and frustrating delay when pressing the take-picture button.  Auto-focus is time-consuming.  The auto-settings features is nice and appears to do a decent job of switching settings based on the scenario it detects.The camera's movie system stores video in Apple .MOV format.  This is not well-supported on PCs.  It's the freakin' 21st century Canon!  If you're going to use an industry standard codec like H.264 then store the file in an industry standard format like .MPG instead of an annoying, proprietary Quicktime format!Battery life is also not very impressive.  Overall, I think this camera is a disappointment.  There are some plusses.. I think the wide angle lens is nice.  But there are more superfluous features like shooting in black and white and goofy modes when there should have been more meat-and-potatoes things like BETTER IMAGE QUALITY.In the end, I got this device to augment my phone's camera and the improvement was marginal and not worth the extra expense and need to carry a separate camera.

I find this quite annoying, because now I have to bring the wall mount charger with me instead of just a USB cable the USB power adapter that all of my other devices use.  For data the camera also uses the mini USB connector instead of the micro USB connector that pretty much all other devices use today.  The battery gauge also doesn't appear to function very well.

What I first found is that it takes a proprietary Canon battery, which has to be charged in its special charger.  So you can't just get AAA or any other easily-available battery.  You must carry the charger with you if you plan on taking more than 120 shots.Secondly, it is way too complicated for a point-and-shoot camera.  When I try to take a photo, the screen is cluttered with icons only a true photographer could love.  I'm a computer programmer well-versed in technical jargon, so this is not a camera for anyone who wants it simple.Next, the \"Auto\" mode decides what it thinks you want to photograph, and stubbornly draws a square around the most inane parts of a scene (in my case, it was my dog's crotch, rather than her face).Lastly, taking a photograph is not just pressing the shutter, oh, no, that would be too easy.  You need to press it half-way, then focus (which it should be doing since it's on Auto), then click the rest of the way down.  Half of the time it takes a picture, half the time it doesn't.  It makes a sound, but there's no picture to be found.If I had time to package it & send it back to Amazon, I would, but my trip starts tomorrow.  Don't buy this camera unless you want to spend a lot of time digging through the manual, and even then, it might not work.  One plus, it's cute as hell.UPDATE:  After using this camera for a week in Europe, I found that a lot of the overwhelming number of icons can simply be ignored.  It takes great pictures, but there is a several second lag between pictures.  Still don't like the half-way press before you can take a picture, and the fact that you can't recharge the battery in the camer, but I'd move its grade from a D- to a B-.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "canon power shot elph 110 HS 16.1 mo digital camera with 5x optical zoom and 1080 hd video silver", "Author": "Gina", "ReviewID": "R5PIEVMD1VOWO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very cheaply made.
