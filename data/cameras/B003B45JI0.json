{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works ok but longevity is questionable...", "Author": "Kyle", "ReviewID": "RQQIYG87CKS9B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this camera for a gift. The battery has been running off a full charge for over a week now and still has almost 90% left with steady use. I love that there are no external moving parts, nothing for sand or dirt to clog and freeze up the lens mechanism. Overall the picture quality is ok. At 12.2 megaPixels a 3\"x5\" should have awesome detail and clarity, but I have been disapointed by this camera. The pictures appear blurry many times, almost always very grainy or pixalated, and the flash causes some faces to white-out. The flash has a double flash that I am constantly finding causes people to blink and almost every picture I take has at least one person with their eyes closed. You can set no flash or double flash. I am yet to try the underwater feature of the camera but would feel confident using it in light rain. The overall construction of the camera has a plastic, toy-like, feel to it. In just over a week there are already multiple cosmetic scratches on it. I hope that this camera will last for years to come and was overall pleased with the purchase. Great kids camera or first-time camera for the average user, not the best for budding photographer or needing great long lasting pictures.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just what I needed!", "Author": "mcash", "ReviewID": "R2I5NPWSI6WVOQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a functional, inexpensive option to the higher end waterproof digitals. I was looking for something for everyday snapshots that would capture my busy life. And this camera has done exactly that! I haven't tried out the underwater feature yet, as I haven't been swimming since I bought it. However, I've seen other reviews and am confident I will be just as happy with that feature as I am with the rest.", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worst purchase ever", "Author": "Missouritraveler", "ReviewID": "R399RFO24SGY0V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered the camera for a trip.

First time in the water,,,,failed and I had to eat the price as a typical consumer, the warranty card got misplaced...so in a sense this is an anti-review.  I need a camera that is fairly weather resistant. All the cameras with retractable lenses will pull sand into the camera body...it is unavoidable. This camera is reasonably priced, takes ok pictures, and maybe works in water, I am afraid to try it....But my experience with their waterproof competitor...OLYMPUS was bad on all levels...especially company service.  Camera drowns in water, only 3 months old.Summary on GE camera:  Small, takes pictures, easy, easy directions, easy upload to computer, and hopefully waterproof...not great but was priced right VERSUS OLYMPUS..priced high and doesn't work at all and no recognition on part of OLYMPUS that their product does not perform as advertised...Ok I feel a bit better for my 380 dollar paper weight vent!", "Date": "August 25, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003B45JI0"}}
