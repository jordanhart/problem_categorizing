{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This may turn out to be my dream camera!", "Author": "anonymous", "ReviewID": "R1ESV5W5N0J5I7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had to buy this with no reviews just faith in the Panasonic name for high quality precision items, and am happy to give it the first 5 star rating for the next customer.  So far so good - just received it and have taken a couple dozen inside shots, some with flash and some without.  I'm amazed at the clarity in low light situations using the flash, which my Kodak C190 12mp couldn't handle.  Easy to change from auto to forced flash or no flash.  Zooms smooth as silk - feels like a much higher-priced camera.  Very small with big LCD.  True to life color, not orange tint like Canon.  12mp overwhelms my old well-loved photo program so I was happy to find a high quality 10mp which is all I will ever need.  Will review again in a couple of weeks after I've had time to give it a good workout.  300 shots on a battery charge will be a bonus, after having to change AAs out after a few shots on Kodak.  I've been through Fuji,  a couple HPs, two Canons, and 3 Kodaks which all 3 ended up with broken battery covers rendering them useless.  I have high hopes for this Panasonic, haven't read the book yet to see what all it can do.  :o)", "Date": "May 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Jenny", "ReviewID": "RE5WPW8ANZRV2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera works great.

Have had it 4 years and it comes through in all situations.  So, when I saw this camera I thot what a great gift for my wife and grandkids.  She has used my camera and felt it did a great job.

Camera is light, well made and the person I got it for thinks it's pretty.  Takes good photos, but you do need to be a closer up for night photography.  I really like the facial recognition feature for taking pictures of people.  Auto-focus has been much better than on previous cameras.", "Date": "November 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "Jess91 \"Jla14\"", "ReviewID": "R2UMJDLG67DV86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera that is really easy to use. It fits great in even my smallest purse and is very sturdy. Although it comes with detailed instructions I didn't need them as the buttons on the camera were easy to figure out and the auto setting adjusts everything for you anyway. I highly recommend this camera!", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "This Camera Has Image Stabilization", "Author": "TC", "ReviewID": "RGWU7VZSZW8CI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought one of these for each of my daughters and they love it as an entry level camera.  It has a great screen on the back--pretty easy to use, even in daylight--unless the sun is shining right on it.It is not a wide angle lens--its a normal or average lense--which is fine for an entry level camera.The image stabilization works GREAT--even i can use it with my very shaky hands.As with all point and shoots, it does not do well in low light.Panasonic uses an extremely high quality lens and the camera is very sturdy.I wouldn't hesitant to recommend or buy again.  The best camera at this price point!!", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice little camera", "Author": "Mountain Momma", "ReviewID": "RKD3RL7823C6Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If this camera had a viewfinder I would give \"ease of use\" another star... and for those more familiar with these digital cameras I wouldn't be surprised to see a solid five star rating being given.I really dislike only having the \"screen\" on the back of the camera to center in my picture due to daylight dimming out the view.  It seems to be harder to find 'viewfinder' cameras and at this price I was willing to forgo that option although if I had it to do over I would pay more to have that.It IS a nice little camera.. 'pretty in pink'... and when checking out the pictures on my computer I am happy with the results.  The rechargeable batteries are nice and hubby liked the battery charger being \"flatter\" then his camera's charger.I finally realized the preset setting for picture size was HUGE (only nine pictures could be taken at a time) and figured out (lucky) how to change it to where I can take around 50 pictures at a time.  At least I think I've done that... \u00dc  Not a great whiz kid on these \"newfangled contraptions\".. \u00dc\u00dc\u00dcI'm curious to see how long it lasts.  The three other digital cameras I had didn't last much over a year.  The 'zoom' lens would quit working.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good for the price", "Author": "R J Chen", "ReviewID": "RGW46AZSXV3QP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my sister who is not an avid photographer, but likes to take pictures during vacations. The Panasonic DMC-F2K Lumix is definitely not the most advanced camera (back when I bought it in '09), but it gets the job done. My sister really enjoys its user friendly settings, so I'm giving it 4 stars (not 5 because as a techie this camera leaves much to be desired).", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love, love, love this camera!", "Author": "Elaine", "ReviewID": "R1OAK65KGBAICH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned numerous digital cameras, and I currently own a Kodak and a Canon in addition to this one, but this is the camera I usually grab when I need some fast photos of good quality.  The size is small enough to fit in the smallest purse or pocket, and its ease of operation and quality of output is fantastic!  I paid far less for this camera than for any I've owned, yet it is my favorite by far.  I also love the compact charging station, which is great for travel.
