I wasn't getting a video, and once I contacted the seller, they set me up with amazing customer service. He walked me through everything, and we realized that my cameras came unplugged. Loving the quality and the help!!!! Very satisfied!!!", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely awesome.", "Author": "LT Sharpe", "ReviewID": "R3KK7BX38L5IVW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I initially had a kguard dvr and camera set and the quality was pretty bad on the recorded and streaming video.  I took those cameras and put them on this dvr and it was night and day.  Crank up all the quality settings and bask in the glory of this thing.  It's got all kinds of great configuration options and the motion masking tool is easy to use.  My only complaint is that the hard drive was not well secured inside the unit.  Other than that it's an incredible deal.  I'm going to pair it with some even better cameras and really go nuts.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$599.99", "Features": "H.264 4 XD1 Real-Time DVR with D1 Real Time Recording & Playback\nTriple Streaming For Recording, Network, Mobile (JPEG, QCIF)\nCMS Support (Matrix Display and E-Map)\nMAC systems Support, Ipad Support\n3G Mobile Viewer Supported For Various Platform Iphone,Symbian, Windows Mobile, Andriod, Blackberry", "Name": "New 4 Channel Embedded Linux US411ZS D1 H.264 Network DVR With 500GB Hard Drive, Real time True Triplex with built web server for remote viewing and operation, backup and operation 4CH DVR 480FPS SATA ready", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31%2BxcY8muML._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002GJ5Z0S"}}
