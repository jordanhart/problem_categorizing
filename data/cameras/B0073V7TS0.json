I would give it five stars if it wasn't for the location of the video record button.  Others have complained about this and I thought it was a bit picky but I do find it annoying. I hit that button by mistake at least once every time I take that camera out. That said, I brought the camera on a trip to Italy in 2012.  I have some awesome photos and video clips. I like that it has all the key features of a full sized SLR without the size and weight.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ultimate Product", "Author": "Kiran Kumar", "ReviewID": "R1HA1AUXR7K2K8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It has been more than 2 months since I am using this Camera. I bought this camera after an extensive research, and I am glad that I didn't go wrong. Unarguably, the best Mirror-less Camera available in the market as of now. I love the Tri-Navi dedicated physical buttons for the control of Aperture, Shutter speed, and the ISO. This kind of arrangement is only available in NEX-7. The 18-55mm lens included with the Camera is not the greatest of the lens which the Camera is coupled to. The camera has a great potential - just need more lenses. I have just now ordered 50mm,1.8 lens. It should be a great experience with that lens. Waiting for the lens now.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera from an excellent vendor.", "Author": "T.
