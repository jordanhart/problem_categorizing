{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Effective 3-D But Limited Capabiity For Now", "Author": "A. Anderson", "ReviewID": "RLHT1F7EQ53BV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have used this model of 3-D camera for about 8 months now and it has its ups and downs. Let's discuss the Pro's.PROS:Compact and easy to holdBattery Life is about 90 minutes to 2 hours if used continuouslyCamera can be charged both in the wall and via USB (cord comes with camera 2-in-1)LightweightTakes 12.1 megapixel shots, many others have far less!When held steady and the right exposure, pictures of simply shooting off into the distance are stunning.PRICE:  Most of the other cameras on the market are $200 and Up that do roughly the same thing as this one.  I noticed Vivitar also sells a 3-D camcorder but its Megapixels are far less.  It was also the same price around $99.  If you want to play with 3-D and are aware this requires the red & blue glasses to see on playback, this is a nice price and did not seem to be a waste of money.  Kids will love this camera!CONS:ZOOM: Zoom is worthless, it looks awful whether you use it a little or all the way, just terrible. (Video and still)EXPOSURE: Exposure control is the most frustrating, it might seem okay when you are looking through the view finder on the back, but then you get home and all the pictures are either washed out and too bright or the opposite dark and dismal.  There is no up and down controlled exposure by touching one button, you have to touch 2-3 different buttons to select \"exposure settings\" like \"+3 Brightest +2 Brighter +1 Bright 1 Normal  -2 Darker -3 Darkest\" this means you can't just adjust right before a shot, you stop, press the menu, search for the exposure tab, scroll down and select the exposure.  Most people move around and shoot, this makes movement on your part, limited if you want good results.MOVEMENT: Videos are okay if you, again, do not move that much, when you pan and shake the unit it gets choppy and blurry.  If you slowly pan it isn't too bad.  If you want the best results for video, use a tripod (same goes for stills!).SD CARD CAPACITY: Videos will fill your SD card very fast!  The camera only comes with an SD card, but you will want to get a larger capacity one right away.  Also keep in mind, video sucks the battery down fast as well.  As long as you have access to a computer or plug to charge up, use it sparingly.COLOR:  The color is not that great in the 3-D images and video, granted its not the worst, but could be better and I noticed on the Panasonic and Sony cameras, they both had better color results.NO CAMERA CASE:  This did not come with any sort of camera case, the unit comes in a plastic bubble wrap.  I suggest getting an average sized camera case for the unit, as the views screen on the back will sratch easily.HELPFUL HINTS:WEAR THE RED & BLUE GLASSES WHILE SHOOTING:  After you use it, you get used to the exposure adjustment control, but I know it may seem silly, but where those red and blue glasses while you are taking your shots, you will be glad you did as you can truly see what you are looking at.SHOOTING IN 3-D:  I have to say it takes some practice to shoot effective 3-D stills and videos.  The first thing you will discover is shooting dangling things directly in front of the camera will prove pointless as they end up out of focus and blurry.  I think this is due to the camera's limitations and sharp focus control on the object and unless they invent a micro setting,  try to avoid popping tennis balls at the camera lens or dangling bits of string in front of it.  The most effective is simply shooting the landscape around you; nothing terribly fancy, but it is very effective.  If you want to begin to compose images with the camera, try to shoot a landscape off in the distance and then find some bushes, shrubs, flowers, even people half way between you and the far distance, and you will see a much better and more effective depth perception.PRINTING YOUR 3-D IMAGES:  I did print many of my 3-D images and give them away to people with the cheap paper glasses.  Sometimes you will find a shot that looks amazing on your computer or TV, looks flat and lifeless once printed.  If you plan to print a lot of your images, I suggest print small 4X6 versions first and see which ones truly are the best before making large prints.CLOSING:  I hope Vivitar soups up their 3-D camera and puts another one on the market with better zoom and exposure control features, better color and longer battery life.  I like the camera a lot and I am still using it to shoot both videos and stills.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Low-End Digital 3-D Camera Gives Very Good Results", "Author": "Just Plain Bob", "ReviewID": "R3R844NDTU9K10", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the title, I say that this is a low-end camera - and it is! However, this is not necessarily a bad thing!When I was doing my research for buying this camera, I found so many people complaining that this camera is substandard to the Fujifilm offering. Well, OF COURSE this camera is nowhere near as full-featured as the W3. Depending on where you buy each of the respective cameras, the Fuji costs 4-6 times what the Vivitar costs. That's just for the camera. Fuji's system requires you to have a 3-D TV, or their own viewer, for $500 more (which I understand has since been discontinued), or you can opt to have the images printed in lenticular 3-D (which is lousy, in my opinion) for a mere $7.00 PER PRINT! On the other hand, the Vivitar comes with a set of glasses with which to view the 3-D image. This can be done on any plain display (monitor, TV, etc.) or one can have regular prints made which will show properly using the glasses. You can buy additional glasses at many places, even here at Amazon!Now, to be fair, these are anaglyph (red/blue) glasses & images. Therefore, there will be some compromises in the images. The color reproductions are a bit dull, and the contrast lower than the better 3-D methods, but in my opinion, not objectionably so. Again, there exists the cost difference factor.Back in the 1960s-'70s, did anyone really expect a Kodak Instamatic to turn out the same quality as a Rolleiflex? Of course not.That is precisely the point with this camera. Its image quality is going to be closer (though, I would say better) to an Instamatic. It has fixed-focus, fixed focal length lenses, of probably simple construction (no specs available on the optics) - so it isn't going to take Hasselblad quality images, to be sure. But I find the images to be remarkably sharp and clear for such an inexpensive camera.The camera does all the typical things digital cameras do:Auto Exposure, Auto ISO, Auto White Balance, Auto Flash (2-D mode only)- and does them quite well. No problems here.Some of the other features:Scenes (basically preset exposure modes)Self-TimerColor Effects (b&w;, sepia, etc.)White Balance PresetsManual Exposure OverrideSelectable Exposure MeteringAnti-ShakeAuto Face-DetectMultiple-Shot capabilitySo, one can see that even though it's an inexpensive camera, it does have some reasonably good features.Now, the major weak spot in this camera is that there is no flash capability while in 3-D mode. One is limited to well-lit subjects only. I believe this should be fixed. It probably could be done with an upgrade to firmware. Vivitar should consider that. An option to save the 3-D images as separate, normal images (no anaglyph) would also be nice. This would allow one to work with the images on computer, and view them with no glasses, and with a better result.I said at the beginning that being a low-end camera isn't a bad thing. It isn't! We need low-end equipment just as much as the super-expensive stuff. I know that I can't afford the competitor's expensive system, so I went with Vivitar. I'm glad I did, because it's an affordable camera that does (I believe) an admirable job at its price point.Try it, and enjoy!", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Save your money for a better camera", "Author": "G. R. Stinson \"DVD and Video Producer\"", "ReviewID": "R2Q1IW7LK1GO51", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is my second consumer 3D camera.  The first was a off brand and I sent it back right away.  I'm keeping the Vivitar, but only because it does the basic job.First thing, it advertises 12.1MP.Well, like a lot of cameras these days, it claims 12MP.  But, that's just the size of the enormous file it saves.  It bet my mother the sensor is barely a 1MP or so.  It's a sleazy practice that electronics manufacturers do, but, I can't fault Vivitiar for doing something nearly everyone else does.  The snap shots are okay for posting online.  You are NEVER going to be able to print these photos and be happy.The non 3D setting takes a better quality photo and has the usual options for taking photos.  For some reason, the flash is NOT available in 3D mode.  The non-3D photos are just fine if you are posting to your favorite social networking site.It is VERY easy to click in and out of the 3D mode.  Which is nice.The camera takes video as well.  Which I have actually found useful.The 3DWell, this is the anaglyph type of 3D.  Those red/blue glasses are required, and a nice pair of 3D glasses are included.  Which was a VERY nice surprise.  If you are expecting the sort of 3D we've been seeing in theaters recently, this is not it.  But, anaglyphs are probably the best known, and popular, type of 3D out there.  If your friends have 3D glasses, the chances they are the red/blue needed to see your photos.I have no idea what the AUTO mode does in 3D.  It certainly doesn't seem to adjust anything.  The only way to pick your focal point for your 3D photos is to adjust it manually.  In the menu.  It is clunky and awkward.  At it's closest setting you will be set on something about 3 feet away.  Once you take your photo, it returns to automatic and you have to back into the menu and set the thing up manually all over again.As I said above none of the regular camera features are available.  Notably the flash.  So, for 3D you pretty much have to use the camera in daylight or very brightly lit areas.The battery.It is sealed in the camera with no user access.  Which is a shame because it doesn't hold a charge very well and you don't have the ability to fix that, or have a spare set of charged batteries to swap out when they die.  I'm baffled by this.  The battery dies so quickly you really have to set it to auto shut off quickly and if you are smart, turn the camera off after every shot you take.  Even if you are planning on taking more.  The time you use to choose your next photo is time sucking that battery dead.  Yes.  It is that bad.The SoftwareMeh.  It's redundant unless you just bought a computer from another planet and it didn't come with photo viewing software.  Just pop the SD card out of the camera and mount it on the computer like you would any other chip.  It mounts as a drive and you can pull the photos off to your computer.  Both Macs and PCs come pre-installed with better photo software than comes with the camera.  The social networking upload features of the software can be duplicated by.... well..... going to the website you want to upload to and doing it the normal way.  There is no benefit to those features.Over all.I don't like writing bad reviews.  But, even though this is a very affordable camera, I expected a little more quality to the results.  Cameras are on everything these days.  At a good price.  On some things the camera is more of an after thought and they take great photos.  So, there is no reason why the Vivitar couldn't take at least photos of the quality of a tablet computer, or a children's toy camera.  That said, the camera does do what it says.  It takes 3D photos that you can look at right away.  For a camera that is less than $100, you get the basics.  Even though your old cell phone probably takes sharper clearer photos.If you want something more than just a fun novelty 3D photo, save your money for something else.

Plus, the Fuji gives you the option of separate left and right images, which you cannot get from the Vivitar (images are anaglyph by default). The photos all suffered from anaglyph ghosting to one degree or another, as well.Also, the camera had issues when trying to turn it off.

I was focusing on the Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W3 Digital Camera with 3.5-Inch LCD but for the price just to goof around with 3d, I couldn't justify this.I got the t135 on sale somewhere and for what I paid, it's fine.  It is a simple point and shoot camera.  The pictures are a little grainy, but honestly as a quick point and shoot it works fine. I just set it to 2megapixel (since most people won't be viewing the photos on anything with a higher resolution)and it's good to go. It handles motion better than I expected, considering I have mainly animals around.The 3d is hard to master. And, honestly, 'master', eh. The best 3d shots you'll take still aren't exceptional. You have to manually adjust the 3d focus on almost each picture, but if the focus is too unnatural the picture will hurt your eyes. So generally your pictures have to be pretty far away.So, scenery. Not indoors. Not close up. Not of faces and stuff.the one features I wish this camera had was to choose between Red/Cyan photos or Side-By-Side photos. If it could take a side-by-side 3d photo than most 3d capable devices can convert that to a single 3d image for you, and lots of software can convert those photos to whatever format you want! The red/Cyan is cute and all but it distorts color and leaves after images around, people with shutter glass and passive glass 3d tvs can really optimize a simple side-by-side shot and make it look awesome.But unfortunately you're limited to Red/Cyan.

I wanted this camera because it shoots in red/blue anaglyph images and video and I didn't need any special hardware to view or edit my videos or pictures.

The video resolution is SD, which is okay for posting on the web or sharing with friends--but you won't be winning any contests for your 3D film that's for sure.  3D is very unforgiving and you have to be sure to acquire good video footage and images because there is little you can do to adjust the images in post processing.  So take lots of pictures and lots of video footage to be sure you get the shots you want.Essentially I view this as a fun toy camera for experimenting and sharing with family and friends--it is not for the serious 3D shooter who wants produce indepent serious movies.
