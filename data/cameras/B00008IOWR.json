{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic camera for the price", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R1ZPM5V0FCBVX2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've checked out many digital cameras in the under $250 dollar price range, and this one really performs the best. I've only had it for a small amount of time and already see how many times better it is than my older HP 1.3 mgpxl digital camera. It's xD picture card is very lightweight and small and is easily accessible. The auto connect USB has worked just as well requiring NO DRIVERS to install and transfer files. The Video Out port also has worked quite well in displaying pictures. The snapshot button to take the pictures does not have that awful delay that other digital cameras seem to be plagued with. The batteries do not last very long if you're using standard alkaline so NIMH is heavily recommended, or the lithium CR-V3. Even with the batteries installed and the xD media card, the camera was very lightweight and compact, easily slippable into a pocket. The pictures that I've taken so far have come out beautiful. Even the digital zoom did a pretty good job of maintaining picture quality while using it due to Olympus' good interpolation algorithm. At 2.5x digital zoom, the pictures still looked very printable. It also offers a lot of adjustable settings from white-balance, flash settings, contrast, brightness, other editable effects built-in, and program modes to manually get the optimal picture, or everything can be in AUTO mode to easily take the pictures. The interface is easy to use and efficient. The pictures tend to take a little bit of time longer than what I would like to store them (about 5 seconds) for the higher quality pictures, but even this is still reasonable. The 2 megapixels are enough for any casual user and the price ... cannot be beat. Overall I greatly recommend this camera for anyone looking for the biggest bang for the buck in this price range.", "Date": "May 27, 2003"}, {"Title": "great camera, great deal", "Author": "C.

I bought it primarily for taking pictures of stuff for auctions, but have discovered that it works well as a general purpose camera. In particular, it is good at catching quality pictures in less-than-ideal conditions. For instance, the other day I was out getting tossed around in a small boat on the ocean trying to take a picture of another small boat that was also getting tossed all around. Even though both the camera and the target of the photos were in constant motion, the images were sharp. It also does a pretty good job of balancing color in lighting conditions ranging from blindingly bright sunlight on the water to dark restaurants. I do have a couple gripes with it. Most annoying is that it forgets your settings, such as whether to flash, image resolution, etc, every time you turn it off. This is really a pain since in many case these settings are only available by navigating menus and if you want to quickly grab a picture you're stuck with it's defaults. Also, it really does eat batteries -- forget about using alkalines -- get several sets of 1850mAh or better NI-MH rechargables.", "Date": "September 7, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good for the money!", "Author": "\"jenny92786\"", "ReviewID": "R2RX9YAM9GR1I8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this camera as a lovely gift from a friend.  I was very impressed when I opened it...really classy and tiny looking with a nice, sleek look and the cute LCD screen.This camera is very good with picture quality!  It beat my sister's ... digital camera with the quality!  It records short videos (no sound) and does the auto-picture thing (set it and it takes the picture in 10 seconds).  It has great options like the redeye mode, landscape mode, night mode, portrait mode, and more!  You can even make your images black/white, sepia (old ancient look), or normal of course.  Good customizations!The bad.  The batteries don't last very long.  I'll say in about 1 hour of use, dead.  So get some good batteries or at least rechargable ones to save you money.Another bad.  The zoom.  The zoom is almost pointless.  First of all, it doesn't zoom very close.  Second, the picture quality is just terrible with each zoom you do.  Because of this, you're almost without a zoom.  Oh well.Besides those 2 bad things, the camera is A-OK!  Worth the money and a great gift for anyone.

Kind of dissapointed to find out that halfway the fun the two AA batteries run dead (you wont survive a party without an extra set), the time lapse between one shot and when the camera is ready for another shot is too long, almost 10 seconds.  Is hard to catch good images with kids because once you push the button it doesnt take the picture for another 2 seconds, and the timer is harder to program than in other cameras.

It takes very sharp and non-grainy pictures.The batteries last very long on this camera (around 4 hours with the screen at low brightness), especially considering it only uses 2 AA batteries.The 16mb xd card won't be enough for most users, so I recommend the Olympus 128mb xd memory chip to go along with this camera. (Other brand cards will not support the panaromic feature)The camera uses USB mass storage, making it very compatible with every OS. This means that when you plug the camera in on windows, it creates a virtual drive and you can simply drag the pictures out of the camera. (Avoiding the horrid software all together). You can also store non-image files on the camera if you want to.The Olympus D-390 also saves very complete EXIF image information, which includes things like shutter speed, light source, date/time, flash on/off embedded into the .jpg. Many image viewers support EXIF tags and you can see these details.The manual is very complete, the only thing I found missing was tips for creating panoramas. The software included assembled the panoramas adequetly, but further cropping is needed in an image editing program.Disadvantages: - doesn't rotate images automatically, even though it detects  orientation - underexposes images slightly, requiring a photoshop 'levels' change - no AC adapter - no optical zoom - flash sometimes fires in bright outdoor conditions - sometimes requires going through long menus to access a basic option (for example, macro mode) - movie mode is low quality and without soundI'd greatly recommend this camera to anyone that's looking for a cheap digital camera that takes sharp pictures.", "Date": "December 6, 2003"}, {"Title": "Pros, cons, and tips", "Author": "Jonathan Aquino", "ReviewID": "R1CKQ28R3LF4GM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like my Olympus D-390, but here are some faults I find with it:- doesn't use power from USB when transferring photos to computer -- drains batteries instead!- no optical zoom- can't turn on menus when lens barrier is closed- no dock- no battery charger- must wade through menus to get to scene selector (portrait, macro, landscape etc.) -- wish this was on a physical dial like on CanonsStuff I really like- price ($... Cdn at ...)- self-portrait mode, where you can point the camera at yourself (is this mode unique to Olympus?)- lens barrier, which doubles as power switch (lower-end cameras like Kodak's often don't even have a lens cap)- quality: 2 megapixels are adequate for 5x7'sTips- by default, all the settings reset when you turn the camera off. Set it so that it doesn't do this (see manual for details)- set the flash to be always off! On one shot it made my mom look like a ghost. Besides, with it off, pictures will appear as in their natural light.=====Update 2004-11-29My mom just got a Canon A-75, and I am sooo jealous! It just pampers you. And macro mode is a physical control - no wading through menus to get to it! Be good to yourself and buy a Canon A-75 (or the A400, which is almost as good and costs a hundred bucks less).=====Update 2005-04-01Figured out a way to avoid wading through menus to get to macro mode -- simply leave macro mode on all the time! It only kicks in when the camera is pointed at something close anyway. Problem solved!Like I said though, if I were to get another camera I would get one of the Canon ones I mentioned.

I didnt even read the manual, and I have figured out how to navigate the menus, change picture resolutions, do video capture, work the zoom, and review photos. Transferring files to your computer and managing the flash disk is just as simple, as the USB mass storage lets you connect w/out drivers or software. Maybe one day they'll start making blue tooth ready cameras in digital SLR formats. Very easy to use. Great for internet based applications like ebay photos, propery viewing, and general photo taking. I love it. I bought mine for $50 from an online classified, and the camera came all the way from Antarctica. For those of you that complain that it resets to the default settings at power off and eats batteries, you're right. however, if you read the manual, or even search the on screen menus, it gives you the option to turn that off, and why in God's name would you not use a lithium battery?!

At first, I was thrilled-a digital camera, emailing pictures, yay. And it took some pretty good pictures. But, the zoom is pointless. Skip that option-it created very grainy pictures. The batteries, as other reviewers have pointed out, do not last. I live in a very picturesque area, and took a number or scenery shots--if you are too far away, like, from a mountain in the distance, the focus is miserable. The focus is also unreliable-it doesn't always focus on what is centered or forefront in the viewfinder. The pictures look great when you first download them, but then enlarge them--major disappointment-totally grainy and unfocused. The red-eye reduction doesn't work-90% of my people shots have red eyes. It is too slow-like others have said-AT LEAST 10 seconds between shot and next shot, and NO ACTION photos-if I take a picture of my dog, by the time the shutter snaps, the dog is out of the frame. And then every once in a while it surprises me and I get a really great picture, where everything works out. It is pretty user friendly, and is kind of fun-at first.After a while, it just gets frustrating.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun camera just to play around with, maybe to email photos with.

I checked auction sites and found a lot of non-working d-390s for sale with the same problem as mine! Not only that but Olympus had a lot of rebuilt D-390s up for auction and even maintained an auction store featuring D-390s. My guess is that if you send your camera in to be fixed and the repair cost is too high, you just tell them to keep it rather than pay to have a broken camera returned to you.

That purchase was the result of a lot of research about the quality of various cameras in that price range (low range of quality merchandise).  After reading some great comments about this camera, my wife and I decided to upgrade our camera from a cheapy to something nice.  WOW, we were not dissapointed.  It's a fabulous picture for the money.  The flash uses a lot of battery power so as many people comment, we simply bought an ac adapter (which has a very long cord).

It is straightforward enough: slide open the cover and it turns on. Aim, zoom if needed, and shoot. But it can't be quite that simple. No, half the time it \"spazzes\" out mid-click, leaving you in the dark (literally: the screen goes black for around seven seconds before getting back on track). And I hope you don't want it to take one shot right after another: it takes three to five seconds to write the picture to the memory card.  If you are headed anywhere that you intend to take a large quantity of pictures be sure and take an eight-pack of double-A's. This camera eats batteries for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  If you use the movie option you will need even more. But there's a bit of a disadvantage to movie mode: there's no sound.  The camera does have a nice wide angle when zoomed out, but it doesn't zoom in very far. It does have a macro option, but it takes a dig through the menu to switch it on and off. Same goes for changing the size of the image. I dug through the menu and figured out how to change the dimensions. Once I bumped it up I had a fairly decent quality picture, as long as I had good light. Once it got to where a flash was necessary, the image became noisy. I have had this camera for almost three years and it finally died (\"finally\" meaning that it went through a year of spazzing, accelerated battery-eating, and increasingly slow response).Essentials:  Pros: cheap; decent enough picture when you set the image size to a larger setting; simple, easy to use at any age or experience level; lasted a long time; simple upload from camera to computer.  Cons: noisy in low light; slow response; slow to write information to memory; camera mechanics noisy when taking the picture; stunted zoom; difficult to change modes (normal, macro, movie); often uncooperative (spastic).So, final verdict:If you haven't used a camera before, great! Go with it.If you have used a camera before, don't.If you're looking for a camera to give a child (tween and under) this is cheap, simple to use, etc., sure.

When you get your camera, just spend 30 minutes with the manual and it's a breeze.  No problems at all downloading pictures with Windows 98 SE.  Only one gripe - the Camedia software on the PC tries to make it seem hard to e-mail pictures.  Tip: go to the editor in Camedia, and from there, save it to a file.
