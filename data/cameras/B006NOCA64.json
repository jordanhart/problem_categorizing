I just wanted a starter camera for them. But the camera is not even that. I am returning them today. They over expose photos (even with changing settings and experimenting), one leaves a gray spot on every photo (right out of the package), one has little pixels missing on the view screen the first day out the package, batteries (AAA)deplete after 20 photos being taken. You have to have your hand very very steady to take a clear photo otherwise most of the photos turn out a blurr.Not worth the $56 + tax I paid for each one.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Vivitar F128---disappointment", "Author": "Scrilla", "ReviewID": "R3BPY0LW0EDFCM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Vivitar F128 I do not recommend, it is a very low quality camera, very poor. Over exposed, underexposed, blurry.....very few instructions. Not happy at all.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible Camera", "Author": "Sheila Edwards", "ReviewID": "R35ZK2XBUL7RU5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for the non-profit organization I work with.  We were on a budget so the price for a 14.1MP camera seemed pretty good.  I have a Kodak 14MP that is several years old that takes great pictures so I thought this would be a good purchase.  Oh dear, how wrong I was!  This camera takes horrible pictures.  The pictures are grainy and the colors are off and it is difficult to get a shot that isn't blurry even with the anti-shake feature on.  I tried taking pictures in all sorts of light and with different settings and I didn't get one picture that I was even remotely satisfied with.  They photos look like something from the 70's.  Additionally, the camera is made from cheap plastic, the buttons are very small, and it is difficult to get the SD card (not included) in and out.  Do not buy this camera!", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Junk", "Author": "ballpeengirl", "ReviewID": "R2CPD2NK59OSEN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "For the price I expected something better than a point-and-shoot but looking back I was better off purchasing a point-and-shoot.  It feels cheap and close up shots are a complete disappointment.  It's not so bad taking photos from afar though and the features are nice and very user friendly but not worth 40-50 bucks; no way.  You have to buy your own SD card and 3 AAA batteries (I guess I assumed it would; I should have read...my mistake).  I played with the ISO settings and other settings to try to make my closer subjects more crisp but it was like it made no difference for any photo whatsoever.  It was the same throughout.  I'm not sure if I can return this camera but I plan to do so. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and took a bunch of photos but then the battery depleted WAY too quickly and all the photos came out blurry; just terrible.  Oh well.  Let's hope I can get my money back.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Junky", "Author": "MarcyDarcy", "ReviewID": "R2W791L196UMAJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was a complete disappointment. We bought this to replace my old one, but it was a complete downgrade from my old camera. After opening the packaging we were looking for the batteries (it requires 3 AAA), we realized it didn't come with any. Then we were looking for the memory card, none. And it requires one to use, so even if it came with batteries, we still wouldn't have been able to use it. Even holding it in your hand, it feels cheap and flimsy. It doesn't have many features, even for a basic point and shoot. It is definitely going back to the store, major let down.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$39.95", "Features": "2.7\" Preview Screen\nAuto Flash\nAnti-Shake\nBlue", "Name": "Vivicam F128 Hd 14.1 Mega Pixels Digital Camera Blue", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31j7N7z8boL.jpg", "ProductID": "B006NOCA64"}}
