She said the cameras break or the pictures were not of good quality.  I purchased this Canon Power Shot camera for her over a year ago.  She is very happy with it.  Takes good pictures and is a sturdy small camera.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good basic camera, especially for the younger set", "Author": "S. Jentsch", "ReviewID": "R3HLGRMY6FF33X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to get my pre-teen daughter a digital camera as a gift, so I didn't want anything complex, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money.I am very familiar with Canon cameras, so my natural tendency was to go for another Canon. After some research, I settled on the PowerShot A460.I think it was a good choice, as it takes good quality photos in the auto mode, has a decent zoom range, and seems to have a durable construction that should last her a long time. While it's not tiny, its small size means that she can carry it around without a case.You're going to need a memory card, and I would recommend at least a 2GB card to take a decent amount of photos before needing to empty it, but 4GB would probably be the best for most people.This is a camera without a lot of complicated controls for those with basic to mid-level snapshot needs. To get more, you're going to have to pay more, but that's the nice thing about Canon's line of cameras; there is a model out there for just about every need.Definitely recommended!", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "canon", "Author": "bc", "ReviewID": "R2UFO73446AAN3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera - especially for the price!!

I thought it was time to upgrade to at least a 5 megapixel and I couldn't decide on what to get.  Did some research and found this is one of the cameras recommended in PC World's June issue.  It was was a decision between this camera and the Nikon Coolpix.  After reading on-line reviews on many websites, I decided on the Canon Powershot A460 camera.  I've only had for a few weeks and I still have some learning, but I'm extremely happy with the quality and features.  I got the blue model at a local store for $129 plus tax and I would highly recommend this.  I took a practice shot of my flowers (see above), using the macro mode and it turned out great.", "Date": "August 6, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Box Content - PowerShot A460 Body, 2x AA Alkaline Battery, Multimedia Card MMC-16M, Wrist Strap WS-800, Digital Camera Solution CD-ROM, USB Interface Cable IFC-400PCU, and AV Cable AVC-DC300\n5.0-Megapixel Resolution, up to 2592x1456 JPEG stills, 640x480 at 10fps AVI Motion JPEG with WAVE Monaural Audio\nWe recommend purchasing an optional 2GB SD, SD-HC, or Multimedia Card for practical use of this camera\n2.0 low-temperature polycrystalline silicon TFT color LCD Monitor\nReal-image optical zoom viewfinder", "Name": "Canon PowerShot A460 5-Megapixel Digital Camera - Blue", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fwmVToEjL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001IWJSCK"}}
