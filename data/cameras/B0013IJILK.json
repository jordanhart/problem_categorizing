Overall, I have been pleased. I have made a few 8x10's with it, and am pleased with the quality. I take pictures in demanding  settings, but I don't like to use an ISO higher than 100 because of poor quality. The focusing is fair, although it doesn't focus in low light. You can only change the ISO settings in \"auto\" and \"macro\" mode. I also frequently use the \"night landscape\" mode for taking pictures after sunset.

I also like the sony's batteries as they are easier to replace (AA vs. the square one made for Kodak that I can't seem to charge).  It's cute and easy, but the quality is less than desireable.

Huge waste of money, so I just replaced it with a Canon PowerShot. I realize I could have just gotten rechargeable batteries, but I was ready to upgrade from 7 megapixels to 10 anyway.I would recommend this to someone who wants a really easy camera to figure out, or to someone who very rarely takes pictures.
