Mind you, there was nothing wrong with my 5 year old S5100. I just felt the need for something newer. The S5100 was a 4MP camera - the S1000FD is 10MP. I loved my S5100 and it did right by me for years, so I stuck with Fuji. It's still in the family...I gave it to my daughter and she's using it now. (Still ticking after 5 years!) I am not a professional photographer, I just like to take pictures and I don't know a lot about manual settings and such. All I know is, I keep the camera on AUTO and 99% of my pictures come out perfect. The camera does have face finder technology and for the most part, I don't have to fix red eye manually anymore. The large LCD screen is great. Battery usage is normal. (Invest in rechargeables! Save a fortune in batteries!) The zoom is decent, but the real test will be from my seats at Yankee Stadium! I'll update on this one later on. The S1000FD also accepts both SD and XD cards. I am able to use the 1Gb and 2Gb cards from my S5100. I purchased 4Gb SD cards for my Creative Zen and can use them with the S1000FD as well. I don't have issues with close-ups coming out blurry as some have complained about. The camera is a step up from the typical point and shoot cameras and a step (or two) below the expensive SLR's. It's much lighter than the S5100 and smaller. Check out the pics I posted which were taken with the camera.

The ability to choose the settings most used and save them is nice also. Low light pictures are very good. The quality of the pictures so far is great.Can't beat this ZOOM either.The larger size Lcd is also nice and the fact that you can turn it off and use the viewfinder, or lower the brightness is very much a help at conserving battery life.Speaking of batteries the best part about them is they are available Everywhere.So if your rechargeable AA goes dead you can pop in a store bought AA battery in a pinch.Bottom line very very happy with my purchase.5-30-08After using now for a while here is an update..The camera is light weight has a powerful zoom and flash.Tripod may be needed if zoomed all the way out.I have owned a fuji camera prior to this one and it had manual focus this does not .

Some surprising features include:- the ability to do in-camera panoramas. The camera helps you position the 2nd and 3rd shots to match up correctly, but even when I do it hand-held, the result is amazingly seamless.- exposure bracketing with several choices up to -1 to +1 EV.- several white balance modes, and of course you can preview what the WB will look like before you take the shot.WHAT I LIKE:- small, lightweight (smallest of the super-zooms, from what I've read)- ranges from a simple point & shoot to a versatile, customizable camera.- Anything you need to learn about photography before you progress to DSLRs can be learned on this camera (manual exposure, aperture priority, white balance, etc.)- rich colors in Chroma mode, over-saturated but OK.- you can pre-set any of several custom modes in an easily accessible way.- Surprisingly low noise results at ISO 64. Personally I would avoid anything over 100, so it's best in bright light or with flash.- I never have to change a lens or worry about dust on the sensor chip.- Fun and easy to use, with lots of features to play with.- The in-camera 3-photo panorama stitching is impressive.- For about 1/2 the price, I get twice the camera I could 3 years ago. - A great value.- you can review your shot with histogram exposure information, if you like.WHAT I DON'T LIKE:- It has even more shutter lag than my old Fujifilm S5100 from 2005. You generally get the moment AFTER the moment you were trying to capture.- very noisy and high color fringing at higher ISOs.", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "black pictures almost half the time", "Author": "Asteroid", "ReviewID": "RYH256P1FWK1P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Check out the review from 5/25/08 by Challenging Designs and the one from  R. Yomes from 7/10/08.  Something is not right with this camera.  I am putting my comment here to share my experience.I've been experimenting with this camera for the last month and a half. I sometimes don't get focused shots because of the delay and miss out on pictures of my children. I used it at the marina on an overcast day and on AUTO setting and my pictures were far too dark and some were black. Today I placed fresh batteries in it (just in case) and I used it while out golfing at beautiful Kaneohe Bay in the loveliest of conditions...also on AUTO. Half the pictures turned out normal, the other half, all along the ocean in gorgeous conditions, were too dark (black, practically) just as the ones from the overcast day at the marina. My visiting uncle was using his new Panasonic Lumix (I will post it here when I find out which one he has) on AUTO, comparable but about a hundred dollars more expensive, and it had NO trouble on the overcast day at the marina. We even shot several of the same subjects! ALL his exposures were perfect with his Lumix! None of mine were successful. I could not understand what was happening as I held my camera side by side with his to compare. Then I read the review by Challenging Design from 5/25. I have found that my indoor pictures are grainy with the flash and brassy without.My husband and I have been happy with our six-year-old Finepix F601Zoom which, much to our surprise, takes better pictures than this S1000fd. The old F601Z has a delay, another reason, besides more pixels and more zoom, that we attempted to upgrade. My Finepix S1000 will be going back to the store.As of today, I find it interesting that a third person (R. Yomes, 7/10/08) has had black pictures, so that's three of us who are disappointed in this camera. I was wondering what I was doing wrong on \"Auto\" mode.  I was glad to have had the chance to compare it with another camera so that I could be sure it was not overcast conditions at the marina the first day.  There was no excuse for the failed pictures on the sunny day at the golf course.  After being so pleased with our old Fuji camera, the new one is a huge disappointment. And yes, I returned it to where it was purchased (I had 45 days to try it...I only used it for about a week before it was malfunctioning).  Not quite sure I want the Panasonic, either, as the pictures have great contrast between light and dark without as much depth of color between as I am accustomed to with a Fuji camera.And, like another reviewer, I am annoyed at how easily the lens cap falls off. The \"missing\" lens cap was my biggest complaint repeatedly my first day using it until I started experiencing the black pictures.I think there's a trend here....three of us have found it takes almost black pictures.", "Date": "July 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good camera, certainly with flaws", "Author": "Anthony DiBiase", "ReviewID": "R2V9LEAII9C29J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Fujifilm s1000fd is a good camera.  I need to get that established.  The photo quality is excellent for the most part, and it has quite a deal more versatility than a standard Point and Shoot camera.  That said, it has many flaws.  It falls down to a choice--it's a darn cheap camera, so if you're willing to compromise for some things, you'll end up on well.Pros:  The photo quality is pretty darn good.  10 megapixels.  The control interface, though a bit clunky, is efficient and works pretty well.  The lens is very powerful--12x is a long distance, and a similar lens on a dSLR would cost a lot more than the entire camera does here.  SD/SDHC compatibility is nice.  The camera has full manual controls for budding photographers.  Startup time is fast.  The AA battery use is nice for people like me who go backpacking for three weeks and don't have the ability to recharge a Lithium battery pack.Cons: The shutter response time is pathetically slow.  My dad's Canon ultra-compact SD660 is faster to respond than the Fuji, despite the fact that the Fujfilm is newer and better.  The focusing speed is really slow too.  No Image Stabilization--which is a must with a 12x lens!  The Automatic mode bumps the ISO too high, which results in too much noise.  The camera doesn't work too well indoors, either, as the white balance is totally messed up with artificial lighting, despite the use of indoor-lighting specific White Balance settings.Basically, if you're looking for photographic quality without regards to response time and the like, it's a great camera.  And it's really, really cheap compared to the other cameras in it's class.  For the value, it's great.  If you're picky about cameras (like I'm starting to be), the camera is a bit of a annoyance.  But it's a good choice for those not willing to spend $400+ on an entry-level SLR.", "Date": "September 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "GREAT", "Author": "K.

Since then I have gotten nothing short of outstanding!I adore the zoom on this camera because a lot of times I take my camera to the ballpark and get higher seats. Great view for watching, but a lot of times not so great for most point-and-shoots. So the 12x zoom and the 10mp quality on this camera is perfect! If my picture isn't as up close as I would like, I can still crop in some without it looking grainy or pixilated.The colors are great, although sometimes not as true without using an editing program, which is true of most digital cameras. Not the camera's fault, but most times it does stay true to color and lighting.Working in a place that sells cameras I recommend this camera a lot to photographers (or parents) who want something more than your basic point-and-shoot.I posted a couple of my favorite pictures to show how well this camera takes pictures.", "Date": "October 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best Price Point of any \"SLR Like\" digital camera", "Author": "C.

I have to say I am truly thrilled with this camera! It has everything you could want in a point-and-shoot but goes farther with a wide variety of customization settings and features you find on much higher dollar cameras. I know it does not have image stabilization and seen a lot of complaints about shaky pictures when zoomed, etc. but the price reflects this fact. This thing is a bargain! Also, if you over ride the auto settings you can set your film speed to a high enough number that you can stop the shakes with high shutter speeds. I took a lot of pictures on my trip and am just thrilled with them.If you want a camera that takes the picture for you, and you never have to do anything except push the button, spend more money on something else. If you enjoy tinkering with your camera to get the most out of it try the S1000fd.

I must clarify by stating that this camera shoots great photos if you know how to use the manual settings. Most of the images I have taken with the auto presets haven't been that great. Using the manual settings allows you the same quality you would expect from higher end cameras. The close-ups are crisp, the color is very clean. The zoom is really good. For those of you who are considering getting into photography seriously or semi-seriously, this is a wonderful starter camera. The fact that you can't change lenses or filters is the only things standing in the way of this camera competing with some of the middle to higher end jobs. If you are looking for a point and shoot, this may not be the best bang for the buck. There are easier to use cameras for less money that will compete with the auto settings on this camera. It is really more for people who can use the manual settings to get very crisp clean images. I would advise getting a tripod.

At first the auto settings worked fine.  Unfortunately it didn't last long.  Then I needed to set up user defined settings.  I need the camera for real estate & area photography.  The size and weight were great. I have small hands and it fit well.  Unfortunately when I used the camera to take photos inside a home, without LOTS of windows, it consistently came out noisy.  It is so grainy even Photoshop can't clean it up.  If there are lots of windows and lights, the Natural Light works fantastic.  But that doesn't happen most of the time.I was also told it refreshed quickly so I can take multiple photos (my childrens' band concerts, graduations, etc.) quickly.  They were DEFINATELY wrong.  We had to wait in between and when I used the \"continuous\" mode (which by the way is a great idea and worked \"okay sometimes\", it took too long for it to start and it \"unfocused\" on my subject.  I missed my nephews graduation \"shake\" with the dean.I applaud the panorama, and with a tripod it was easy and stitched well. However, it maximizes at 3 photos with low resolution and no flash.So I took it outside to do an external virtual tour.  The photos came out VERY brassy and didn't handle the shadows well at all, very noisy (pixelated).  Today we took it to the Marina to try one last time.  It was overcast, but still had okay light.  I used auto, SP2 landscaping, and even manually configured the camera and the photos came out dark and even solid black (underexposed) on many.  You would think the \"Auto\" mode would take care of outside ambient light, but it was awful.In summary, I love FUJIFILM, the price, weight & grip; the panorama & natural settings are great, some of the times, but they all have too many negatives.I would not recommend this camera at all.  It requires too much manual settings for the amateur and doesn't respond to the settings for the semi-professional.I hope FUJIFILM comes out with an updated version.", "Date": "May 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very nice little camera, with many features of a much more expensive DSLR.", "Author": "Chris W.", "ReviewID": "R1MHQ6GG40X1YL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For everyday shooting, this is an excellent camera.  It is user-friendly, compact, and takes very clear photos.  The macro mode is superb.  I was producing some spectacular close-ups right out of the box.

In very high-light environment, especially where there is a lot of blue sky, it is very difficult to get a good exposure.  Even with lots of manual manipulation, the pictures never seem to come out right.  In general, outdoor pictures come out better than indoor ones.  I am very impressed, however, with the level and quality of color in the pictures.  For things like flowers the pictures come out absolutely brilliant, with exceptional crispness.

I had to change settings continuously to get a picture to come out \"decent.\" Since the AUTO setting was poor, it was too cumbersome to take pictures. I had to take the camera back and ended up spending more for a 10 Megapixel Canon Powershot. The Canon is slightly bigger and heavier but well worth it.

Granted, to actually use the megazoom feature, you'd probably need a tripod or really really steady hands, the zoom thing itself is just so neat. All the settings are fun to play with and experiment: learning how to read the exposure histogram, understop the F-stops for aperature settings, the use of bracketting, etc. was a very entertaining use of my winter break time. I haven't found any flaws with the camera; the only quibble has already been noted by many professional reviews: that noise start appearing at ISO 400 (acceptable), but gets way way worse by 800 and utterly unusable by 1600 (like looking at a cheap 80$ B&W; security camera). All the functions and facial algorithm work as you would expect.The camera is built fairly sturdily, and so far, the batteries have lasted a lot longer than I realize (I'm still using the alkalines that came with the package and I've been tinkering with flash, and just about every function of the camera for over 6 hours now over the last few days). Most pictures (Except at really large zooms) come out focused and clear. I'm not an expert so I won't comment on color/saturation but the different setting modes--portrait, night, landscene--seems to work well in emphasizing colors appropriate for these kind of shots. Good technology is so cheap these days: this camera is so much better than the cruddy HP camera I got 5 years ago.Conclusion: solid, reliable product for really cheap price.

Why? more megapixels and a few more features. The S700 still works beautifully and I gave it to a friend who wanted a Digital camera but is having some financial difficulty. She's absolutely thrilled with the S700 as I was and I'm even more thrilled with the S1000.Some of the many great features of the S1000 are that it can take a SD card up to 16 gigs! I immediately bought a 16 gig SD card. The means you can do hours of video and the video feature on this camera is excellent for a camera having that feature. The colour, resolution and clarity are superb. The automatic face detection is great and accurate. The zoom is smooth and and gives great pics at a long distance unlike a lot of other cameras out there at a much higher cost. The operation is beyond user friendly. I've had digital cameras for several years and I hav eto say that Fuji is just plain the best out of all them. This actually is the third Fuji I've owned. I'm  gadget freak and just keep upgrading for more features. The quality keeps going up and the price keeps going down. Gotta love it. This camera has a very sturdy, solid feel and looks like a real camera. It sips batteries. I've had it for over a week and have used it a lot just getting accustomed to the multitude of features and I'm still on the Panasonic Alkaline batteries that came with it! I have a fresly charged set of Energizer NIMH batteries ready to go when the original ones wear down. I may have to recharge the NIMH batteries before that happens though. The manual settings are perfectly easy to set up and produce stellar results. Each time I use it and I use it daily, I find more to love about it. As far as the previously mentioned ease of use goes, one might think that it's easy for me since I've been using Digital cameras for several years now and have become seasoned. Well, the Lady I gave my S700 to is not a seasoned Digital camera user. It's her first one. The S700 in some ways has more steps involved than the S1000 to accomplish the same thing. She took to the S700 like a Duck to water with very little coaching from me. The S1000 with more features is even easier to use! I highly recommend the Fuji S1000 for a newbie as well as a seasoned Digital camera user. You'll get professional results with your first click of the shutter. Oh yeah, those of you with Pets! You know how even with the red eye feature on most cameras, your Dog or Cat has the glow in the eyes. With the Fuji S1000, my Puppies eyes are the natural soft, warm Brown she has. Try THAT with another camera! The software is extremely easy to load.With all my enthusiasm, there has to be at least one down side right? yeah, there is but a very minor one. The manual that comes with it is basically just an out line to get you up and running. The detailed manual is on the software. Nobody likes running to the computer to pull up the manual when you wanna do something a little more than point and shoot. Do what I did. Go put and buy a folder, some plastic sleeves, make sure you have paper and enough black ink in your printer and print out the detailed manual. When I say detailed, I really mean detailed. The manual is a whopping 164 pages! You can save paper if your printer can do two sided pages. It's worth it.Just go out and buy the darn thing.

I was really impressed by the size and general ergonomics of this camera.  I went looking for a reaonably priced s1000fd to try out.  I was recently on a vacation where I took a Nikon D60 and Canon A720 and was looking for a lighter rig from the D60 for traveling.  I had gotten someone a Fuji A2800 as a gift back in 2001 and was hoping for a much better experience.The feel of the camera in your hand is very good.  The EVF is usable but small.  The 2.7\" rear LCD seems to want to be touched when picking up the camera so fingerprint smudges will be common (get a protector).  Fuji's menu systems are not as refined as most of the other players.  The lens design does not permit attachment of a lens hood and it is not threaded to take filters.  The largest concerns are around picture quality.  There is visible grain/noise at most ISO settings under most conditions.  The camera cannot handle strong backlighting and the EVF/LCD in those cases shows an image 2-3 stops brighter than it will actually record.  High contrast scenes in general are not handled well.In comparing images taken with the s1000fd and the A720 of the same subject under identical conditions it is clear that the Fuji sensor is just not picking up detail.  You can see brickwork lines on a building a hundred feet away that are fairly clear on the A720 and just blotchy guesses on the Fuji.  Highlights through a bush that were handled well on the A720 became starbursts on the Fuji.  The Fuji sensor was strong on reds and yellows but very weak on bringing through blues and somewhat week on bring through greens.  Although I ended up returning the model I had in a few days due to SD card read/write errors the largest problem with this camera is the paradox of unfulfilled potential.You have a very nice sized and to hold camera with a decent lens.  There are plenty of settings that an enthusiast would use.  But the design fails to deliver on it's apparent promises by not supporting filters, a lens hood, adequate EVF or clean enough image quality for someone who would be attracted to this kind of platform ('bridge' camera).  Often the red-eye remove cannot locate the eyes.In summary I really like the design of this cameras body, perhaps the best of anything I am aware of.  Canon has been doing very boring designs lately in the bridge/superzoom range.  I suppose someone who has outgrown a P&S; and wants to get into more control, like a teenager, may benefit from this camera.  In past times I would have recommended a top of the line Canon A-series model like A720 or A590.  But it appears Canon have abandoned the A-series to control-less P&S; and am struggling in the new SX series getting things right.  If you are looking for a bridge model then Panasonic FZ28/38? seems to be the stronger contender.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "best cam for the price", "Author": "J.

I recently bought a pro series Olympus but still keep my old Fuji handy. For the photographer who wants to capture those moments with family and friends and also have the ability to set up a stillilfe and play with artzy-fartzy shots too, this camera can do it all.  It's light weight and compact body make it easy to carry around. I have taken this up mountains. It's very comfortable to use in terms of its physical handling and operational accessibility. It can be a little confusing sometimes, as ISO, color, and compression are in one menu and shutter, aperture in another, and white balance, sharpness and other things you might want to adjust in still another. The live screen is excellent but the digital viewfinder is terrible. This can lead to batteries dropping like cats, they die but at a relatively acceptable rate. Luckily it takes AA so if you can find a mercantile way out yonder, you can keep shooting.The zoom is impeccable. I say it can do 70mm-130mm (even if it says different.) but keep in mind that is somewhat tight. You can't get the whole family, Grandma Bertha and the Donelly Twins all in one shot.The focusing is pretty good as long as it's not in full zoom. In the last 4 millimeters it seams to have trouble and tends to leave you with blurry pics; but otherwise it out performs my $600 camera!  You get a shutter of 1/2000 to 8\" that can handle what most sane people want to do. The race horse may be difficult to catch. It gets shaky at 6 or so, depending on how shaky you are. But setting it down on a shelf or tripod fixes that right up. There's some shutter lag that can be annoying. The cap has a tendency to come off which may have you wiping off finger prints more than you may want to.  In auto mode you will always get great shots within reason. And when you do want to outsmart the camera you certainly can with the other modes present. I have to mention the macro mode for it is amazing in the price range. It can focus amazingly close and still get you the best pictures you'll ever see; A feat that can be replicated by only the top performing lenses in the world. A $500 macro lens needs about 9 inches to focus correctly. I have pressed thing on to this camera lens and got a shot in crisp focus.

Still have very good pictures from that unit. But the FUJIFILM is a superior camera in all senses. Optical zoom is way much better, the LCD panel on the back is clearer, larger, and has more definition. You can also switch off the LCD to save batteries and use like a conventional  camera. You can program the settings for landscapes and many types of outdoor situations. Has a continious shooting option with manual/automatic shutter, up to 15 consecutive images, perfect for motion photos. Panoramic pictures are amazingly easy to take, and images are incredibly crisp and clear. Even the video option allows you to film with considerably good definition and sound.

I could have saved some money at Amazon but I had it in my hands at Radio Shack and I liked the feel.Consumer Reports rates this near the bottom but I am very pleased with the images it makes.  Yes there is chromatic aberation in the corners and barrel distortion at wide angle, which the pricy Leica lens in the Lumix has been designed to eliminate.  And it does!  Even so,for half the money, this Fuji has a much more powerful flash and much more versatility. I recommend both cameras, but if the pressure is on for a once in a lifetime event, I'm going with the Fuji.Consumer Reports likes the Kodak Z1012.  That's probably why its hard to find a good deal on it. I'm sure it is a good camera and I like my old Kodak C433.

Years ago I had a wonderful finepix s5200 with which I had shot some award winning photographs. I grew as a  photographer and went on to the digital slr and a mighty sore back from the lugging.Enter my purchase of the s1000fd.Now I am not comparing this cam to a dslr but to the quality and low level of noise from a predecessor of the same line of this manufacturer.This model has some great features but the low grade was for the unacceptable amount of grain and the sometimes counter intuitive path to simple functions such as getting out of one mode to another.Still it more than holds its own and when I hit paydirt with this little gem it is a joy. However those great new features may be why the graininess is now an issue.I prefer the N mode and the lack of optical image stabilization. Now the camera is like so many of the long zoom wonders without the great image quality of previous fuji cams that resisted the cry for optical image stabilization.For me that trade off has led to a significant loss of picture quality.  Like the panasonic fz series the image stabilization is a major tradeoff for having to shoot at the absolute lowest speed to compensate for the ugly noise and graininess that makes very few shots taken in shade or natural light usable.Too bad otherwise it is a nice little camera that has much to admire but the bottom line in photography is the end result and when I can only use one out of every fifty shots because of the noise than I am saddened.", "Date": "February 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fuji Finepix", "Author": "S.

You get less than what you paid for. Aggravation is pretty costly.When it works (half of the time) it's pretty good.

Opening the battery cover to reset the system works but you have to retake the shot.3) The included software does not play well with XP professional - possibly because this computer only has a slow speed USB port. USB driver would not install and software hangs for periods of fifteen minutes when trying to download images. It also lacks customization features like which exact folder to send the images to. How dumb!4) It's not even possible to easily bypass the crappy software by direct access because the memory card does not show file sizes. Still photos sometimes download fine and sometimes crash. A power cycle of the camera will repair. Avi videos do not download at all. Transfer just hangs until an error msg pops up. Cannot move files either. Must copy, paste, then delete manually.5) Camera does NOT come with an AC adapter jack. You have to buy a horribly overpriced gadget that plugs into the battery compartment instead of your batteries.

The latching mechanism is flimsy and under a lot of stress whan closing or closed.

I took one class in college and the whole aperature, f-stop, etc. went completely over my head. I am for sure a point and shoot type person. I might zoom in or out sometimes but that's pretty much it. This camera takes fantastic pictures with out me having to know much at all. I leave most of my shots in the auto setting or the natural light setting (which turns off the flash.) The first thing I like about this camera is that I did not notice as much shutter lag as I did with other cameras. The moment you're shooting is or is pretty close to the moment you get in the picture. Secondly, the auto focus does very well with close up and zoomed in shots. Other cameras I've owned, once you get too close or get past a certain closeness of the zoom, forget about focusing. Third, I also like what it can do with low light and natural light. I usually only use the flash when taking traditional portrait or group type pictures. Lastly, the panoramic shots came out great (once I figured out how to line them up correctly. The bad ones I got were mostly due to user error.) I can't say how this measures up to other cameras though because I'd never tried a panoramic before this one. Another thing I like about this camera that I didn't realize until recently is that it can use either SD or XD cards which is nice if you already have one or the other from other cameras. I found the user menus easy to use but I might not be the most reliable person for that since I'm so used to them and maybe don't remember what it was like to learn them. It seems like I figured it out pretty quick though.Just for a reference point, other cameras I've used are:-Kodak easy share 6.1 mp: not a bad camera but 6.1mp is low these days and the camera is old-Olympus Stylus 770sw: not a terrible camera and I like the slim design but shutter lag was my biggest complaint with this one. This however is a waterproof digital camera so I use it mostly for that. The Finepix is better for the above mentioned reasons.-GE x500(?) 16mp: Not entirely sure about the model but I bought it because it looks similar to the finepix and I thought it might be one of those instances where, though the products were from different companies, the manufacturer might be the same so I assumed performance would be similar. Plus, more mp. Not so much. Not a bad camera but the zoom/close up focus was poor and I never got shots near as good as with the finepix. Still haven't figured out the menus either.The Finepix s1000fd I'm buying off Amazon is actually the second one I bought. The first one I got used off ebay and worked great until I dropped it... twice. The first time was on a hard basement floor. The only damage it showed was that one of the prongs that held the battery door shut broke off. It didn't quite close all the way but the battery door still made contact and the camera still worked fine. The screen was fine and the lens didn't get knocked out of place. The second time I dropped it the other prong broke off so now the camera won't stay on. I bought the GE as a replacement but it wasn't as good so I'm going back to the finepix.

If you don't use the flash too much and use the optical viewfinder [which I prefer to use over the LCD viewfinder anyways], the batteries will last quite awhile in this camera.Video quality is decent and has sound with it.I thought of getting another one now, but it costs over 2 times the cost I paid for this camera as new in late 2009 and that bothers me. I am still looking for a decent replacement for this camera and the newer Fuji digital cameras do not seem to meet the photo quality standards that the S1000 had and I used the identical settings on the newer Fuji S2950 digital camera that I wanted to use as the replacement for this model....but the newer S2950 fell short of my expectations.To make a long story short, I recommend the Fuji S1000 digital camera to anybody that is fairly new to the digital camera scene or somebody that wants pretty good photos in most situations with a camera that is rather easy to use at a faily low cost...well it was faily low cost when I purchased it in late 2009.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera Purchase", "Author": "Chief", "ReviewID": "R3D55FQ2Z96YY5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like the camera it came as described and works great.

It also has the capability to manually set up for specific shots for the purist. My wife takes lots of pictures and the 2gb SD card included allows one to shoot all day. She has filled the card once with close to 800 pictures on the highest definition. Many more could be taken at the two lower settings, but she likes to play with the photoes in Picassa, and Photoshop. The high definition allows her to do almost anything she wants. Additionally the back view screen is wonderfully bright even in low light, the use of the view finder is almost never necessary. In Low light situations it will take a very nice pic with ambient lighting. Admittedly, the flash is needed in dark conditions and for shadow fill outdoors, (under trees for example).Would recommend this camera to anyone who wants to take great pictures.

I had only ever used a point-and-shoot 35mm in the 80's and, for the last few years, my 1.3 mp cell phone camera.  It takes good pictures for what it is, but this is obviously a marked improvement.  I've had it a few weeks now and haven't used all the settings and features, but its pretty easy to figure out.  The full manual comes on a CD-Rom, making the font bigger and easier to read, and navigate.  The focus does work a bit slowly at times, but I've adjusted to it easily.  Indoor photography can be blurry sometimes without flash and when the subject is moving, but that's to be expected, especially when not using a tripod.  I have tried the \"SP1\" setting or \"party\" setting in low light with pretty good results at a choir concert.  The size is also very good- fits my hands well; I am about 5 ft tall.  I put pins in the neck strap, though, because one side came undone while wearing it and nearly fell to the ground!

The video is of decent quality. The new \"panoramic\" picture feature is interesting. It is very simple to do and allows for some creative photo composition. The image quality and zoom are all of acceptable quality.The only negative aspect of the camera design is that the flash does not automatically pop up in auto-flash mode.

I remember being careful not to cover the autofocus sensor with my finger, so that wasn't the problem.  I took several photos around the house and back yard in different modes, but all of the photos were, again, slightly out of focus.  If you're looking for critically-sharp images, buy another camera that has a lens you can manually focus.

I primarily used my camera for family photos and sold the occasional stock image. I would have bought another E550, but, I figured, hey, why not upgrade so that I can produce more shots to sell as stock photos? Well, if you want to do anything with your pictures beside put them into a family photo album DON'T buy this camera. I have tried various indoor lighting setups with photography bulbs, I've tried natural light, I bought the light stands and photo box. I've tried everything I can think of to coax a usable photo out of this camera.Basically, auto mode is unusable. You'll get a clear image, but the colors are so incorrect that it's ridiculous. Greens look brown, brown looks iridescent gray and it can't render striped textures. Blues look washed out while skin tone looks orange. I cannot use this camera to take a basic stock photo because the noise levels at the best settings are too high. Well, I figured I'll just use it for my ebay listings. Well, guess what, I can't do that with it either. The color rendering is so bad that it takes me about 10 minutes per photo to fix them to make them even ebay worthy.With manual mode, you can take a few decent outdoor photos. BUT, the whole point of buying a point and shoot is to be able to point and shoot and still get a somewhat decent photo. That's something this camera cannot accomplish.I don't see how a camera that is technically better then my old one can create photos that are actually worse then the ones I used to get out of my very first, 'bottom of the barrel' $89 digital camera. From the specifications, this camera should be able to do so much more.
