Picture quality is decent, not as good in the dark, using the zoom at 5x without bright lighting means blurry pics. This camera is tough. I accidentally dropped it from an 80 foot high parking structure onto rocks in Vegas and I went to get it, hoping that the batteries and memory card could be salvaged. To my surprise the camera turned on and worked perfectly. Other than having some scratches to the casing, it was working perfectly. Then while at the lake it fell in and got soaked. It turned on about 5 days after drying, though it does have some lines that show on the pictures when they are taken now. Getting another one because of this.", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "WB", "ReviewID": "R22ZZWZYNHTSJP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my Olympus FE-310, which was also a great camera. It served me through the sand, dust and rain of Iraq for almost 2 years, and then another year of outdoor expedition after that. It finally bit the bullet kayaking, when I capsized, BUT it didn't fry the memory card, so the pictures weren't lost. This camera is the newer model, virtually identical, same maker, same design, same layout, just 4 megapixels finer, and great optical zoom. It takes AAs, which I like, because I can bring extra and not worry about my one rechargeable camera battery dying mid-day. The auto-focus, unlike another reviewer said, works fine, if you know how to use a camera. And, for taking time between photos, almost always relates to how much battery power you have left. Because this takes AAs, if you use crappy alkaline AAs, performance time isn't great. Duracell and energizer work great in it, and their lithium batteries work awesome. But again, that is battery choice, not the cameras fault if you put cheap batteries in it. All in all, this takes very clear pictures, has a decent 5x optical zoom, compact, large display screen, easy function, and very durable.", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Little Fully-Featured Camera - Photos To Prove This!", "Author": "Ray Ben", "ReviewID": "R301PZXNXOK6JA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There have been some poor reviews on this camera, and reviewers who have judged it harshly. My experience with this has been good. I have some photo examples to share and will update as time allows. Please cut and paste the links below to see these examples:***EDITED***Evidently, photo links are not allowed in these reviews. I have provided a few photo samples in the Product Information section, though they are small. What I had wanted, was to show some large, real-life examples.************I did not buy this as a primary shooting tool, but rather a back-up ... something I keep in the glove box for quick shoot emergencies.It's 12MP capability is more than what is \"normal\" for it's price point. What really sets it apart though, is the 5X zoom, something uncommon in cameras of this ilk. It's also unusual to find an inexpensive point-and-shoot with wide angle, a VERY nice bonus.The proprietory xD Card is something of a bother to some, and although the xD card writes FAST, it (generally) costs more than an SDHC card and it not quite as universally available. Olympus addresses this by thoughtfully including a Micro SD adapter in the box - into which you can insert a (universally available) micro SD card, and use it as though it were an xD card!Many people harp about lack of long-time battery life (in this and other cameras). Part of that is the simple fact of owning a Digital Camera. Face it folks, Digital Cameras eat up a lot of battery power.Those who have found insufficient battery life on this, can help that by optimizing the BATTERY TYPE in the camera itself. Go into the Setup Menu and Select Battery Type, either NiCad or Nimh Rechargeable. I wonder how many owners who have suffered (and complained about) short battery life actually knew about this.No, this camera is not the greatest in the world, but it does not pretend to be. For what it is, the results are (in my view) stellar. My Five-Star rating here is based on the Value ... how much you get, for how much you pay. The optics are sharp, the focal range long (and wide) and the cost is thin.There have also been some good, thoughtful reviews here, by people who have actually used it and found good results. I can't add much to what they've stated but will say the proof is in the pudding, and I believe the sample results I've provided here attest to that.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very low quality picture", "Author": "Tienou", "ReviewID": "RC1YI0QHVZ4HU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera few months ago and I'm disappointed because of the very low quality of pictures (I take better picture with my cell phone which is not a very good one...).

Lauer", "ReviewID": "RENKVUP0V53IY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a cheap digital camera, no question about it, but for the price you get a very nice camera. It's small, uses readily available memory cards, and seems to take very nice pictures. It also has a 5x optical zoom, which in hard to find in this price range, and it does short movies.The camera is a little slow compared to my much older Olympus, but that may have been due to the batteries we were using. Even with partially-used, cheap batteries, it takes beautiful pictures as long as the subject isn't moving rapidly - the colors are rich and life-like. The flash is, as is typical for Olympus, a little too strong for taking short range pictures. I typically solve this by holding a small piece of white copy paper in front of the flash when I'm shooting at close range.We haven't tried the movie setting yet, but I'm not expecting much since it's primarily a still camera. Who knows, it might surprise me - won't be the first time Olympus has managed that.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Olympus X-42", "Author": "Spider Monkey", "ReviewID": "R3K3LBHMAKC4OR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This `Olympus X-42' is a small attractive camera and incredible value for money. To find 12 mega pixels, 16 face recognition, 5X zoom and a 2.7 screen is impressive stuff, but when you factor in the low price it ends up being nothing short of outstanding. This takes AA batteries and whilst this makes it slightly thicker than other cameras with internal rechargeable batteries, I find it fits better in the hand this way; companies can make things so small they aren't practical anymore and this camera is just right in my opinion. There is a `quick start' guide in the box, as well as a more comprehensive manual on an enclosed CD-ROM, but to be honest this is so self explanatory and easy to navigate around that it is very quick to get up and running. The manual is good to fully utilise the features this camera offers, but if you want to just point and click then this is great for that as well. There is also some software included so you can transfer and manipulate photos on you computer more easily and whilst basic, is a pretty good bit of kit. I'd recommend you buy an external memory card to go with this and there is also an adaptor in the box for micro sd cards. You don't get a case included in the price and it is well worth investing in one of these, but this is a minor niggle and not unusual these days. The camera body seems a little lightweight, being plastic, but it ensure the camera isn't too heavy and I have carried this around all day with no real problems. All in all this is an excellent entry level digital camera and much better value than many other cameras out there in a similar price range. It is well worth considering.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "cheap camera", "Author": "yg", "ReviewID": "R3T1DPK68SQ8X1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The spec's on the camera were great on a $69 camera.
