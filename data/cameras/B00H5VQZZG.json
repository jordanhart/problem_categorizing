You may need to install the free setup software from the BuyMobius website, to help with added features (I recommend!). You can also download the PDF manual there. They recommend a PC for Mobius setup, but there's also an Android app for mobile users. Kit comes with tools to take apart the device to explore other mounting solutions for your vehicle. Package arrives safely and quicker than expected. I may buy another from this merchant in the future!", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "good dash and sport cam", "Author": "Cole Brooks", "ReviewID": "R3GDVTT0NXOZXS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been testing this for a few weeks now. I've been using it as a dash cam for the most part, but it's portable and I've used it to record a couple company meetings and some outdoor family activities too.Pros -- easy setup, easy to use.- clean clear images even at high res mode.- very nice camera for it's size and price, barely bigger than a matchbox.COns -- none yet", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice camera for action sports!", "Author": "MI6.007", "ReviewID": "R61F4THTPCW8M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this cam by Novotm thru Amazon here and opted for the free shipping. I am supposed to get the camera on Friday the 23rd but instead got it on the 19th... what a pleasant surprise! The camera works great. Video quality is amazing both indoor and outdoor. Couple of things you must know: there are 2 usb wires that come with the camera... a long one and a short one. The long wire is for the car I suppose. When you connect the camera to pc with the long wire, PC won't read the camera as a drive but will only charge it. You need the short wire to connect with the pc. I also used msetup.zip program to configure my camera. You can edit the modes on the camera as well which is great (yellow-1/blue-2 mode). Since I don't have any use for the 720P recording on blue mode I changed it to regular recording with 1080p. But I changed mode 1 to upside down (180 degrees) and wide angle recording for the car. Yes I don't have the wide angle lens but it can do wide angle as well! I also connected this camera with my android galaxy note 3 using the short wire and a usb connecter and the phone can read it as a usb drive. You can also download a free app called aMCA Mobius AC for android (not sure if it's available for iPhone but a simple app search should let you know) and change the setting on the camera thru there instead of a computer.Overall I'm pretty satisfied with this camera and the vendor's shipping time out to me was amazing!", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price", "Author": "Mark Fehrenbach", "ReviewID": "RQSMI3HSCNY1U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has great picture quality, could be a bit bigger if you have large fingers to operate the buttons.", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1C3YXR9MAXJWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't know how much more I could add that the other reviewers have already said.  I have another dashcam with a screen and it works well, but I like this one so much better because of the size.  The picture quality is great and the setup is easy with the downloaded program.Don't underestimate how hot this thing gets.  You cannot leave it running in a hot car on a sunny day.  Burn your fingers hot!  Still a great camera though.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is a fantastic little camera!", "Author": "Stanley Tang", "ReviewID": "R1VD0OONJTZ7P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using this for the past few days as a dash cam, I must say that this is one of the better camera on the market. Great image and audio quality, in a fantastically small size (about the size of a box of TicTac). The best part is the price, which is very good value for what you get.Pro:- Very good value for the price- Small size and light weight- Excellent overall image and video quality- Decent Battery life (when fully charged)Con:- Low light video quality could be better- I wish Battery life could stretch a bit longer from a single charged- Instruction manual could use some improvement- Better support for the camera configuration softwareOverall, this is a great camera (especially use as a dash cam), with good value.", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just GREAT", "Author": "naswingman", "ReviewID": "R1ANVJP4ZL43UC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very easy ti install (mine is at the top of the windshield next to the mirror).

Really small!  So hard for anyone to spot.2-Great support from the developers and the community (RC and Dash Cam).3-Terrific Firmware thats easy to update and adds TONS of functionality with every change.4-Fantastic GUI (program) that is made by 2 very awesome users.  They listen to the community and add functionality (with the developer) that the community requests.5-Easy to install and use.6-No screen.  This is how they keep it small but also its really unnecessary as once its set up you dont really need one.  View footage on your computer.**NO YOU SHOULD NOT SHOW THE COPS YOUR FOOTAGE AT THE SCENE!  GET HIS EMAIL AND SEND IT LATER AFTER VIEWING IT YOURSELF OR SEND IT TO YOUR INSURANCE AGENT OR A LAWYER IF NECESSARY!**7-So many other uses...RC plain, car, boat...Biking...Undercover...etc etc..CONS:1- No screen.  To some this is a con, and when you are setting up it is which is why you NEED to buy the video cable for it!  Without it setup is not so easy.  With it, its almost joyful!Also, be SURE to buy from a trusted re-seller.  Novotm has been involved in the making of this camera since day one and is still heavily involved in firmware and GUI advancements (which he gives away for free!)  He ships FAST.
