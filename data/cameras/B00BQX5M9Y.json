I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $270, $30 cheaper than most retailers. Many stores are selling out...the price is actually going up.Let's begin:This camera is COMPLETELY waterproof and fairly shockproof as well. Great for travel and vacations! Mine is bright yellow and comes with a nifty wrist strap, so it's hard to lose.The resolution is great for the price, the lens glass is sharp and the sensor works well indoors (but not at night, for the most part).My favorite feature is the HDR setting. For the uninitiated, HDR (High Dynamic Range) photographs are typically merged together from a sequence of light-medium-dark photos of the same subject. HDR allows for a very even exposure of highlights and shadows, when a normal photo would leave the sky bleached or the trees blackened. Some HDR photos look a bit surreal, but this is not a \"professional\" camera. The word which best describes this camera is \"fun\". It's just plain fun and easy to use.Some other nice features are:**The automatic wifi transfer to your PC (OR to your smartphone/tablet, just download the APP and hold the camera *ON* your device to ensure a connection)**The panoramic mode (works well with a steady hand and a well-lit area)Overall, a great little travel camera. I highly recommend this to families, since it's practically unbreakable and simply enough that a child can use it.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera above and below the water line!", "Author": "Craig P. Donovan", "ReviewID": "R1BO8DN0ANPGE9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after reading the so-so reviews about the Nikon AW110.  The camera was too new to be in the stores so it was purchased sight unseen.  The bottom line is I could not have been more impressed with the performance of this camera.  My daughter used it during a week long vacation to a Hawaii, both while snorkeling and on land.  The underwater pictures and video's were great.  On land we got to try out the panorama features at the beach and the picture was perfect.  Could not be happier with this purchase.I only had 1 issue....Not sure what happened but I had to remove the battery to reset the camera just 1 time .  The other dozen or so WiFi transfers went without issue.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "This camera does the job!", "Author": "cynthia gurley", "ReviewID": "RLYVH6WW9HXAK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched long and hard before purchasing a P&S; underwater camera, I finally chose this one for two reasons 1. Fujifilm has done the most R&D; in the underwater camera game and 2. I had to buy something bc time was running out before I left for my vacation.So...I took my fuji down 15+feet and the photos came out amazing, I took it on several very rough catamaran trips even shooting video that sounded great and looked amazing. Of course the wind and sail were whipping in the mic but you could hear us laughing and having fun. I treated this camera much like I do my expensive one, padded case, always strapped to my wrist, except it got wet and sandy and went into my beach bag. I was super careful not to get tanning oils on it and rinsed it off within an hour. I only opened the battery chamber when absolutely necessary and only after the camera was allowed to air dry.Note for diving/snorkeling: If the sun is behind a cloud life underwater is pretty black and white... I thought my camera (and maybe my mask) was malfunctioning. If you dive in shallow water with the sand stirring up, pictures will be hazy. If you shoot at the surface on underwater mode you'll have red or purple photos.. (I'm no pro photog I know there's a red filter but can't remember why) My finger got in the lens only once during my 6 hours underwater, it was an easy crop. I did not use a float strap because they didn't feel right, the lanyard that comes with the camera cinches up nicely around my wrist. I held my camera up when I entered the water as not to bash it against the water.Battery Life:  the battery that came with the camera had good life, the backup off brand I bought... not so good. I think power levels fluctuate in other countries so a full charge wasn't always a full charge for me in Jamaica.Indoor/Outdoor photos: use the settings and available light wisely, your photos will be sharper.Wireless to my iPhone was so simple and fast. You don't need an internet connection to send to your device... GPS and clock were nice. I didn't have to wear a watch.So1. Easy to take single handed photos2. The power button is close to the shoot button but has a different texture, I turned it off and missed a few shots at first.3. Go easy on the battery chamber4. Watch out for tanning oils and lotions, I actually used a tiny bit of bar soap and water after handling it with oily hands and rinsed it very well.5. Buy a name brand back up battery6. Use a float strap if you plan to be on the water but it wasn't useful for me diving6. READ THE BOOKLET ... It's a very user friendly camera but you'll do better faster if you read through the book.This camera performed above and beyond my expectations.

We bought this for a trip to Hawaii because we knew that we wanted to be able to photograph underwater. It was awesome to have on the beach because we didn't have to worry about sand damaging the device.Does it take photos as good as a cheap SLR? No of course not, it's a point and shoot, but I'm not going to spend hundreds of dollars on an underwater case for just a few photographs on vacation. I did haul my good camera in a protected bag to the beach everyday to get the killer shots, but I never was without this camera on our adventurous trip.We had so much fun with this that we photographed fish and beach photos everyday with it on our 12-day trip, but we did have to charge the battery every night so I wish the battery had lasted longer per charge. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this camera because of the battery life, but you will probably need to charge it every day you use it on a vacation because it's so much fun to use.Is it really shock proof? Yup! While on our trip, our 2-year old wanted to hold it and of course threw it across a stone walkway pretty hard as I watched it bounce for 5 feet in horror. It immediately shut off and I couldn't get it to work as I thought we had just broke our new camera, but my husband took out the battery and put it back in and it immediately worked. After a few dents to the front, it still works great.Does it shoot in RAW? Being someone who shoots in RAW I researched for an underwater camera that would shoot in RAW, but I don't think any of them do under $400. This camera only shoots in JPEG and after using it, I realized I could deal with it because underwater photos in the ocean are never great unless you have additional lighting and very clear water. This camera really excels in a pool, but I still recommended it for fun sea life. Also, the video is only 30 fps. It does not offer 24 fps, but I still had a blast recording video.My absolute favorite thing about this camera is that you can send photos to your phone or computer through bluetooth wirelessly. This was great on vacation because we could take underwater photos and instantly text them to our family and post them on our social websites.Moral of my review: BUY IT!", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Xanax equivalent for outdoor and underwater photography :)", "Author": "dpan10980 \"Got Pulse!!!...\"", "ReviewID": "R395Z4V2CSHTRU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for recent trip that involved water trips, hiking and animal safari. Wanted my kids to take pics without parents constantly reminding them not to break anything. We took camera 15 ft underwater, put it under the 90 ft waterfall and there were no leaks. Pics came out great in all conditions. 360 panorama takes some getting used to before you can get good shot. Battery drains a lot faster then other cameras in this range in my opinion. WiFi transfer is great, but make sure that power cord is connected if you are transferring a large amount of data. This camera is not a replacement for your dSLR but rather an addition to that.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great all-around digital camera that happens to be waterproof", "Author": "Gearhead Mania", "ReviewID": "R1KL3M7YL66577", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fujifilm XP200My friends use older FujiFilm XP waterproof cameras on the lake and in the river with great success, and the XP200 came highly recommended. However, my impression is that the XP200 is a great all-around digital camera that happens to be waterproof/shockproof. The XP200 also turns on almost instantly, so it is handy for those sudden situations on the water.The 16MP sensor takes rather good pictures! The 5x optical zoom is impressive, as there are no mechanical lenses that move around. There are multiple features like 3D, HDR, and panaromic shots. However, the 3D and panaromic features aren't as quite refined as I'd like. The panorama feature isn't nearly as good as the feature on my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone.The XP200 takes true HD video, but the odd thing is that it only does 1920x1080 at 60 frames per second, and a 32GB SDHC card only allows about 23 minutes of footage. That's roughly 190 Mbps in the Quicktime .MOV format, whereas a GoPro or Sony Action Cam or even my Samsung Galaxy S3 would take 1920x1080 at 30 fps in roughly 20-30 Mbps in AVHCD MP4 format.The thing I really did not like is the fact it uses a proprietary USB cable. It is about the same size as micro-USB, which has almost become a standard among mobile electronics manufactured in 2010 and beyond. However, it happens to be specific to the XP200. I don't like this because I already keep a bunch of AC adapters on a power strip and they each have an assortment of micro-USB and mini-USB cables. Now I have to keep track of a proprietary USB cable designed for the XP200.The photos have good overall clarity. They are not going to be professional grade, but would be great for Facebook posts, sharing, and even scrap books.The video quality is quite good, about on-par with my Samsung Galaxy S3 which both blow the GoPro Hero3 out of the water. Here are the specs on the videos that the XP200 produces in comparison to the other devices:1920x1080P at 30 fps unless otherwise specifiedFujiFilm XP20059.94 fps, AVCHD, Main Profile, Level 4.1, 2 reference frames, 18.7 Mbps data rateSamsung Galaxy S3 (4.1.2)AVCHD, High Profile, Level 4.0, 1 reference frame, 17 Mbps data rateGoPro Hero 3 SilverAVCHD, Main Profile, Level 4.1, 4 reference frames, 30.2 Mbps data rateSony HDR-AS10 Firmware 1.03MPEG-4 Sony PSP, AVCHD, Main Profile, Level 4.0, 2 reference frames, 16.0 Mbps data rateSony HDR-AS10 Firmware 2.0059.94 fps, MPEG-4 Sony PSP, AVCHD, Main Profile, Level 4.2, 2 reference frames, 25 Mbps data rateOverall: 4.5/5 stars.

The pictures turn out clear and the wifi transfer program works great for downloading to your phone except that it only transfers pictures, not movies.

It hasnt caused a problem yet but it is something I will monitor.  If this were a $150 camera, then I would give it 5 stars but for being close to $300 I expected zero issues with this.

I have used it several times at the lake now, in and out of the water.  I like to keep it with close with me while I am kayaking and it is great for fast one handed movie filming. I can zoom in and out without blur.  Takes great photos and has a pretty good zoom for not extending.  I have been able to get some excellent wildlife photos. The feature that lets you shoot in black and white but keep one color is more fun than I thought it would be.  Certainly wouldn't use it all the time, but it really is kinda cool.  My favorite thing is that is that the auto mode works great so although there are many good settings to choose from, I like feeling confident in just pointing and shooting, especially when I'm outdoors playing around.  I do like the wifi feature too, easily transferring photos to my tablet as soon as I get in.  I was disappointed that it does not have GPS and have not taken the time to load coordinates from my phone as it says to do.  I'd much rather it just have GPS, but the rest of the features and feel of the camera make it worth it for me.I initially gave it a great test in a bucket of water before I took it out to the lake.  I picked up 2 float straps to try, an Olympus and a Pentax. I was concerned because of the weight of this camera but both worked.  The Olympus was much better though because the float is much more visible on top of the water.  The Pentax was pulled into the water leaving just a very small part of the float visible.  I can splash around all I want on my kayak with my camera and not be concerned in case it were to fall in, it floats with the float strap.I just can't see someone being disappointed by this camera.

It performed great and had no damage from the pressure.I was happy with the underwater pictures and video; however, the underwater shooting mode does not adequately correct the green tint that is common with any underwater camera. I believe there's a mode to apply a red filter, but I haven't tried it yet. I'm hoping that may work better than the underwater mode.The picture and video quality is great both above and below water. The sound is great as well.I have several complaints with this camera, though all are fairly minor: - The button placement is awkward, especially the zoom. It would be better to have the zoom near the shutter for use with your right forefinger or at the bottom of the camera for use with your thumb. It's nearly impossible to zoom without holding the camera with both hands. - The zoom is quite jerky and slow to focus, so it's not suitable to zoom while filming. - Similar to many (especially older) compact digital cameras, there is a large lag between shots. - The LED light works okay for filming at night, but it's quite frustrating that it's always on (doesn't wait until you hit record) and then it doesn't turn back on if you switch the camera on and off. - The menus take too long to flip through. Once you memorize where you want to go it's not too bad, but the menus could be much easier to navigate, especially to functions that you need to get to quickly and frequently.Overall, I'm very pleased with this camera, especially for the price.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "RMBN1R2R1XJI7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Of all the digital cameras that I've owned over the last decade, this one has to be the fastest, sharpest, and most robust of them all.

Waterproof to 20 feet, all those great features, HD video, stereo audio... all that stuff was awesome.However, I HAD to return this camera.  It was going to just frustrate me and make me kick myself for spending the money if I didn't!I bought this for the waterproof-ness, which was also fine, but in 75 degree weather, over the course of a few sunny days, this thing overheated 6 or 7 times while I'm shooting video!  It would simply say it's getting too hot and had to shut down.  IN THE MIDDLE OF MY VIDEO'ING!  So, I ended up with incomplete videos of the events I was shooting.  I had to open the side door that houses the battery and SD card, and blow into it and try to cool it down so I could resume shooting.  And even then, after a little time outside in the sun, it would overheat again.  I missed some good moments on our cruise because of it, and have incomplete vids now.PS: I live in Texas.  It's NOT hot outside yet.  If this is how the camera reacts in moderate temps, I'd be SCREWED shooting with it in a Texas summer!Another thing, the videos only shoot for a length of about 21 minutes each.  Then you run out and have to start a NEW video, so if you're video'ing something longer, say a wedding, you'd have gaps where you'd have to start a new video.  This is regardless of how much space your SD card has on it.  You're limited to 21 minute video times.So again, I WANTED to love this camera and use all the great features and look forward to the great pics I was going to get swimming in the ocean and lying on sandy beaches... but this ain't the cam for it.  :(  I believe the waterproofing has left it without proper ventilation and thus it'll overheat on you in even moderate temperatures.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect on the go with family", "Author": "Melissa A Carlson", "ReviewID": "R131JVF45O855", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "so far an awesome camera for on the go picture taking with my fast paced family.

It's easy to see in water.Though I never got to go any deeper than 20 feet, I took it on different outings over a three day period.  The first day I took it snorkeling for probably around 3 hours.

The second day I took it on a thirty minute Scuba dive at around 20-25 feet and it worked great!  I had people coming up to me in the water and with gestures asked me to take pictures of them with their friends.  When we surfaced everyone wanted to know where I got it and how much it was.  The third day was a mix of snorkeling and beach use.  It got covered with sand and my little cousin dropped it a few times.  There was once when I jumped off the boat and it slammed onto the concrete.  Not even a scratch!  It still works great!

We went through Class 10 rapids, rain, and sand storms. I was armed with my GoPro and my XP200 (Yellow is cheaper btw) point and shoot camera. The Camera performed exactly as I expected. The action shots came out great. The optical zoom allows for great close shots of faraway objects and I was able to pull it out, power it on, and shoot pictures on the fly with very little issue. The video looks great too. It has a dedicated Video button to record at any time.  Got some great shots and vids where the rapids drenched me with cold river water. The sensor(camera eye) has a thick glass to protect it from the temperature changes. Any fog or water droplets that dried on the sensor glass were easily wiped away. Jumped into the river while making a video and there were no skips or issues when reviewing the file. Remember this is a point and shoot, lighting is on you. Far away shots with light behind the subject will give you a silhouette. It happens. Other than that. A+++Pros: Easy to use.

I wish they had added a shutter timer (this would have removed the only con i had), but its water proof/ruggedness more than makes up for that one feature I missed.I definitely recommend this camera to any outdoor enthusiast that isn't looking to put their expensive SLR's at risk.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Richard Arsenault", "ReviewID": "R3W50Y1H0CZKQ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been using Fujifilm XP for 6-7 years now and the camera's keep getting better and better. still need a little work on transferring pics to smart phone", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great camera for the price! Not perfect, but darn close...", "Author": "SnowMountainsRiversGuy", "ReviewID": "R1BU1UVDGYNU1K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We purchased the XP200 for a trip to Belize that was mostly snorkeling, sea kayaking, surf sports, and a little scuba. My prime reasons for choosing it were the increased depth rating (50ft) and the fact that it used the same batteries as the Fujifilm XP100 that we already owned that we had bought for a similar trip to Hawaii (we learned that it would be best if ALL snorkelers/divers had their own camera).  The XP200 performed admirably in all conditions. It has some well-appreciated upgrades from the XP100: a much better and easier-to-trust hatch closure latch, easier-to-use zoom control, and very accessible multi-frame (speed shooting) button that is not menu-dependent.  It has plenty of \"shooting condition\" exposure options in the menu, and the SR-Auto setting worked well for everything except underwater, for which there are two separate special settings anyway.  For a point-n-shoot with a tiny flash, this thing took some AMAZING underwater photos in the crystal-clear waters of Belize.  I took it on 3 scuba dives, every one to just slightly beyond the 50ft camera rating, and it functioned flawlessly and did not implode.  For snorkeling and kayaking, this thing is amazing.  The lens coating that Fuji has developed sheds water almost perfectly every time, and out of nearly 1600 trip photos, I only got two or three with water drops on the lens.  That is hard to beat. I'm not a huge fan of video, but I shot some underwater at 8ft of a moray eel eating a lionfish I had speared, and it came out brilliant, too.  Is this camera as good as a DSLR??? No, your photos might not be quite as super-clear, and may need a little \"help\" from some of the awesome photo-editing programs out there (I am a huge fan of Picasa). But, you can slide this thing down inside a lifejacket and not know it's there, and have it on its very strong wrist leash while you snorkel or make moderate-depth scuba dives, and bring back some pretty amazing pictures without feeling weighed down by a boat anchor.

I was disappointed by the wifi. It's not true wifi, you need to download the apps and then try to get them to work.  Really had to research to find instructions on how to use the app and get the camera to work with multiple devices.The wifi means that the camera will talk to the apps in order to download the pictures to your devices, in my case the iPhone and iPad.  There also some timing issues with getting them to see each other.  Also, you have to disconnect or delete the previous device you synced it to in order for it to see a different device.  I thought it would be easier than using the cable to transfer the pictures, but with the syncing and resets, it's easier to use the cables.Other than that it takes nice pictures.  It's smaller than I thought it would be and fits comfortably in my hands.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera, just buy extra batteries!", "Author": "racecoar", "ReviewID": "RZXKA69YFDI4R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my Olympus Tough (not sure which model). This is larger in width, leangth and weight. However, not buy a huge amount. I thought it took the same size batteries (they fit inside but did not work). The camera mode shoots 1080p x 60 frames, which is really clear HD. That does however eat battery time. The pictures are 16mp which is 2mp higher than my last camera (good). It also has a wifi function, haven't quite figured that out yet. I plan on submersing the camera soon to see if it lives up to its 53ft depth rating.
