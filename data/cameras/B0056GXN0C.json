The lenses are fairly easy to attach even though they come with absolutely no instructions.  However, once attached and you look through the veiwfinder, it's like looking through a funnel.  When I tried the telephoto lense, only a small spot in the center of the photograph is clear and the rest of the photo is really blurry.  I own a new Canon XS40 camera which this set of lenses is supposed to be designed for.  The auto focus settings don't work AT ALL with this set of lenses and are impossible to use  The lenses appear to confuse the cameras auto focus and in my opinion with the continual \"struggle\" the camera has trying to focus with the lenses attached might even damage the camera.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0056GXN0C"}}
