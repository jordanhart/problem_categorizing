{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Liked it so much - Purchased same for replacement", "Author": "John '88", "ReviewID": "R2MNXY4D0S1RBX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm overseas and my wife's Blue Sanyo Xacti that I had purchased for her several years (~4) ago stopped working.  She assumed it was a bad battery and purchased a new battery from Amazon but it did not solve the problem.  So I found a $40 used Sanyo Xacti in a burnt orange.  She loves it because she doesn't have to learn all the features to a new camera and now has three batteries (org with blue camera 4 yrs old, replacement battery, and the one that came with the used orange camera).  It is a handy little camera that fits in pants pocket or purse and is used for a lot of quick family photos on the go.  This camera really introduced my wife to digital photography and now she literally uses it everyday.", "Date": "September 18, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "8.1MP /2.8\"Lcd Monitor/3xsuper zoom lens/Anti-Blur", "Name": "Sanyo Xacti Vpc-t850 Blue ~ 8 Mp Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom & Face Detection", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vKXXuduQL.jpg", "ProductID": "B001K241A2"}}
