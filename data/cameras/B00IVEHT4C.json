{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A novelty? Yes. A tool for photography? Absolutely.", "Author": "Michael Catacutan \"@michaelbenito\"", "ReviewID": "R2VO35AA4R0I9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My current camera collection consists of a Canon 5d3 and L glass, a pair of Sony A7's with FE lenses, a GoPro and an iPhone 5s. I've also owned micro four thirds cameras and was an early adopter for the Fujifilm X system. I say this not because I'm trying to convince you that I'm a real photographer... I just want you to know that I have a lot of experience with digital photography technology. To say the least, I'm an enthusiast that loves to document life.Off bat, what interested me was the small minimal form with a 1 inch sensor, the tiny 24mm equivalent pancake lens and the rotating \"selfie\" screen.The small form factor: It's very fashionable. I called it a novelty because it's unusual and kinda cute. Great for parties and events. The camera feels premium. I'm quite astounded how they managed to fit a huge battery (rated 600+ shots) in such a small body.The sensor and lens. I haven't done a ton of pixel peeping but the sensor seems to be pretty darn good at lower ISOs. I don't plan on using this for any sort of low light photography but I wouldn't mind turning the flash on and taking some group photos (or group selfies) of friends. Also, the pancake lens is superbly sharp. A bit slow at f/3.5 but again, I don't plan on shooting in dim lighting with this (without flash).The \"selfie\" screen. I'm not ashamed of the selfie. I don't mind taking a selfie here and there to document me in front of amazing views or worldly landmarks. I've often handed my camera to a stranger to come back to a blurry photo or odd composition. While the 24mm won't get a whole lot of the background, it gets enough without distorting my face too much.Are there things that could be better? Of course. The lens for instances has no cap or cover. It's almost like mobile phones where the main glass is covered by another glass.Wink face detection. When you wink, the photo is taken after a few beeps. It's a cool feature so that you're not pressing the shutter button down that may cause camera shake, but the winking is a little buggy. Hoping they can fine tune it with a firmware upgrade, otherwise they should have omitted it all together. I wouldn't put a feature that was more frustrating than useful on a product.I'm not sure how much more the camera would retail for if they added a higher resolution LCD screen, but it would have definitely been welcome, especially at this day in age.All in all, it's just a really fun camera that packs a punch when put in the right hands. I feel it's also priced rather competitively and you get a good deal for what you're paying for in my opinion. And while the flip screen may seem like a novelty or a one trick pony to some people, for me, it's actually a versatile camera with great image quality relative to its sensor size.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "liking it so far....but with a few reservations", "Author": "Mary Keever \"maryintexas\"", "ReviewID": "R3M05MGN19GL32", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "received my NX mini today--the mint green on with the 9-27mm lens kit. i have been playing with it off and on most of the day. takes great photos, macro, selfies, and others.my 2 reservations....the info from the manufacturer states that an adapter is included in the box. this is not true. i spoke with samsung today, who were very nice, but the adapter must be bought separately. i think this is deceptive. in order to use any other lenses i will have to buy an adapter.  the other reservation is that the adobe lightroom 5 software bundled with the camera is just a 30 test version. after 30 days you have to buy a license. again i think this is deceptive.if not for those 2 things i would give this fun, cute little baby a 5 star rating.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera but not perfect", "Author": "Joon", "ReviewID": "R2NGCZR8IK5TQ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not professional photographer or own expensive full frame like others.I'm just normal guy looking for everyday use camera.I've been using my smartphone and Canon Eos M for my trips.Here is my short reviewProsSmall and lightfast AF compare to my slow EOS MBattery last longyou can use Galaxy S4 batteryMicro usb charging port(yay)180 flip for selfiewifiConNFC sux on this thing(don't work all the time)Picture/color quality is crap compare to Eos MExpensive lense capResolution on 3\" LCD is crap (320x480)impossible to find case9-27mm comes with seperate lense cap but 9mm comes with built in lense cap(about 3/4inch size)This is Samsung only lense cap so you have to pay $ to Samsung for little glass that cost less than dollar to produce.", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Super Sleek and Super Shots", "Author": "GreatMom", "ReviewID": "R3G5FRBLAH6RMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the mint green. Love it. Very stylish. I'm focused on the look of the camera but the photos it takes are awesome. I love all of the features and options. Very nice bokeh from the manual option. Love the wink selfie option. Easy to use with touch screen option for mode and menu options. Lots of fun.  But I must say, the look of it gets a lot of attention. The mint green is the best.

Love it so far.  Has lots of great features and is beautiful to look at (mint colour).  I'm mainly writing this review to clear up some of the other comments in the reviews.The camera advertises as coming with a lens adapter.  It does not.  This is a separate accessory that needs to be purchased.  I'm unsure why the description has not been updated as this issue is known.Samsung was no help when I contacted them.  Amazon on the other hand tried their best to find the adapter but it was sold out everywhere.  Instead they refunded me the value of the adapter, which is above and beyond what was expected they would do.  Very satisfied with this.A couple of other notes from other reviews.  The 9-27mm version does come with a wall power adaptor and lens caps.  Other reviews stated that wasn't the case, but perhaps that's the case with the 9mm alone.  As well, the adobe program is not just a trial. The registration code is provided.  Also, purchase a memory card (micro sd) right away as you can only save one picture without one and can't use many of the features that require wifi.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "There is no zoom!?
