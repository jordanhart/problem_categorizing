I orgianlly was going to buy a cheaper camera but decided to spend the extra money for something I will have for many years to come.  We went on vacation and put it to test after we got it.  We took it to a waterpark and just clipped it to our swim suites and had hours of fun.  I loved the expression we got from other people thinking \"haha you forgot to leave your camera on the table\" but once they saw us taking pictures they would all look and you could see the envy.  The battery lasted all day and the pictures and videos were great.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this camera.  Buy it with the knowledge that you will never regret it and is worth the extra money.", "Date": "August 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Studjugg", "ReviewID": "R30JU8W4S174MC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for work.
