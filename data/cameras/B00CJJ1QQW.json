Even though I knew very little about how to use it I was able to take some remarkable pictures.  It is light, fits my small hand very well, and easy to hold for long periods of time.  I recommended it to several people on the trip who were just as amazed by some of the shots I was able to get as I was.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great kit and an excellent deal for such a nice camera", "Author": "Elias Lindenberg", "ReviewID": "R3MZZA1XN1Z1BH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fantastic Deal and great camera.

Remember the camera body and lenses are Canon but everything else is third party, but it all works fine and I've had no problems. good price for the package. Camera is light weight and compact, loaded with features, and just what I wanted, my first DSLR but I've had other digital cameras. The instructions included are a bit slim so it might be a good idea to get a book, like David Busch's or the 'Dummies' book because you probably want to use more than the FullAuto Mode to get the most out of the camera.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Huge value package", "Author": "broncohall", "ReviewID": "R5FXKQBMIACSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This package was incredible.
