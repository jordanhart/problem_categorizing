I called it a mini 1D, since it has the 1D AF system which is fast and lock focus right away. I can use all the old full frame EOS lens and third party lens without issue. Thanks for the effective micro focus adjustment. High ISO is usable all the way to 12800, which is smoother than the ISO 800 of 5D mark I! The jpeg output is very amazing, sharp and vivid. I am not the one who have the patience to do post-processing in front of the computer for hours. 5D mark III allow me to get the perfect shot right from the camera without processing. 100% viewfinder, speedy AF, 61 points AF tracking, mouth-opening high ISO performance, continuous shooting like a machine gun, super-fast digic processor that save photos in top speed. It also has the right weight to support those heavy L lens and the grip and handling are perfect. The quiet mode for shutter is a plus. The only thing that distract me is the Rate button, that I feel is not needed. However, I remember I can program it to do something else. The Custom C1,C2,C3 setting in the shift-protecting knob are very sweet, so I can save 3 set of customized settings. The vivid LCD screen is high-end and crystal clear and crisp. Video mode is also super nice, and I hate the lens AF for me, because I don't want motor-noise. From the outside, it may look like a Mark II, but inside it is a mini-1D for me without the bulk! Nice upgrade, built with quality, solid semi-professional DSLR which is a work horse for sure. Does it worth $4200, I would say yes :) I found this bundle deal with some goodies including a must have Sandisk 32gb extreme and Canon gadget bag , for about the same price this is the right way to go", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Question", "Author": "javier jimenez", "ReviewID": "R95G9WPV8H049", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera includes in this kit is refurbished?
