{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The best you can buy in its class", "Author": "dorel_c", "ReviewID": "R1Q0R0FCS65LDS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used different cameras, from manual Russian cameras, to state of the art point-and-shoot. I have even fiddled with digital cameras, and considered switching to digital. Well, I decided to stick to film for now, so I bought the Nikon N-80 (known in Europe as Nikon F-80, same camera with minimal software differences).This is a very good camera, which adapts to every kind of user.Occasional users: You can set it to automatic mode, in which case you have a very expensive point-and-shoot camera (even though I don't know why would one buy this camera to use in auto mode only). For people with little experience the camera's many controls might be intimidating, and the included manual provides help only for people that know quite a bit about cameras. Also, the flash has to be popped opened manually in order to work, which many people would forget (like I do sometimes). Perhaps, for ocassional users, it would be better to stick to a point-and-shot camera designed for point-and-shot.Advanced amateur photographers and hobbyists will get the most out of it. Think of a professional camera similar to F-100, without the proffessional price tag. They will have all the customizations offered. I love the simplicity of exposure controls. You can switch by turning a thumb-wheel between pairs of speed-diaphragm while keeping an optimum exposure (in auto mode). In addition, a good option is continuous or single shot metering mode, which comes handy in action situations. For situations when timing is important, the controls are so well placed that once you get used to them, you can change all the settings without even taking the camera from your eyes.If you are a professional, you already know about this camera and about the F-100 line, which might be better for you in some situations (even though in 90% of the cases this camera would be more than enough).Things that might need improvement:In dark places, the focus is somewhat slow (even if the \"illuminator lamp\" is used), and if your subject moves, you might have a problem focusing fast enough in auto mode. I lost some pictures in the beginning, until I learned to circumvent this issue by switching to continuous focus, or even to manual focus. I think that any other camera in this class would have the same troubles in similar situations.All things considered, I love this camera and I wish I had more time (and money) to play with it.", "Date": "November 4, 2002"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$359.99", "Features": "The N80-QD is a sophisticated SLR camera body that's designed for excellent performance with flexibility to meet virtually all of your photographic needs.
