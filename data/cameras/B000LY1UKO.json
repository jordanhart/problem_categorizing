It was very easy to use and I was able to take some really great pictures. The only drawback (and it's a minor one), was that I missed the view finder. I only missed it when there was too much sun to see the LCD screen.  Otherwise, great little camera!", "Date": "June 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Emilio \"rufusndufus\"", "ReviewID": "R7OL0AJRJAR8V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice little camera.

I don't care too much about mega pixels; I wanted a name brand that had a 3x zoom at a low cost, this E30 fit the bill. This camera comes with some of the best software available in my opinion. The E30 is also durable. I accidentally slung it across the sidewalk about 15feet (it slipped from my hand). Just a minor scratch is all that happened. For $115.00 this camera is a bargain", "Date": "June 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Easy to use, long battery life", "Author": "Robert W. Sharp \"Rob_S\"", "ReviewID": "R1K2W3Y5MRQYK7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought rechargeables (AA-2500mh) with the camera and they last a very long time--through video (quite good, sound too), flash, and a variety of settings and uses. I'm pleased.Contols are super-easy to learn. I previously had a Pentax that died after about 4 years, and can tell you it was a hard-sell to get me to buy another. I liked how it felt after a trial run; this camera improved virtually all the weak areas of the old Optio 430-shutter lag (better, not instant), controls, tactile button feel, etc.Screen is good-automatically dims slightly to save energy after a few seconds but brightens up instantly when you touch a button.Only two very minor demerits:1) no viewfinder (bright sun makes it a little difficult to see the screen, but camera orientation still makes it easy to get the shot), and2) flash strength - the flash has fairly limited distance; fine for indoor shots, a bit of a challenge for shots past 10 feet or so.Really great camera and value for the price.", "Date": "July 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "New Camera", "Author": "Frank Bratjan", "ReviewID": "R3Q5D41NX6BBRD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I checked out a few cameras and found this was the best buy.

The pictures I have taken so far are good, except at beach. Without a viewfinder the screen is a mirror in the bright sun. Also, the description of the camera said that the batteries would last for 200 pictures. Not true at all. I only got 24 pictures out of the batteries, perhaps because it was so difficult to see in the sun and it took so long to take pictures. Guess I will take a bag of batteries on my upcoming trip to Italy!Post Script to above review: used the camera on my trip to Italy and it was excellent!!! Took almost 200 pictures & only had to change batteries once. The battery seems to recharge itself..battery indicator sometimes reads yellow then next time you use camera it's green -- so you get lots of pictures.  Pictures came out great..still miss viewfinder, but this is a great camera for the money.Post-post-script: On May 18, 2008, less than one year after purchase of this camera, the lcd monitor inexplicably broke - did not drop it, no undue handling - camera was in my jacket pocket.  Pentax claims the damage was my fault & it's not covered under warranty. $97 to fix a $99 camera!!! Absurd!! Was great camera until it broke. Went to Italy & back with no problems & took great pictures.  Never thought I had to handle camera like it was a raw egg, if you get my drift - so still don't know how monitor broke.  DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!", "Date": "August 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera!!

The new batteries lasted only 2-3 days and I only used the camera for less than an hour. I bought a charger and some rechargeable Ni-Mh batteries. They don't fare any better than the alkaline.
