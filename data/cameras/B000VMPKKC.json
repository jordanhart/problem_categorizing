{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great pocket camera", "Author": "Timothy L. Meigs", "ReviewID": "RGWSKRRV84AFF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Every setting in this camera works very well.Easy to use . Clear ,bright screen.The dual stabilizer works better than any I've seen. The kids , while spinning in a circle , would snap a picture , and what ever it was pointing at that time, came out very clear , no blurs.I really like the metal body too, just feels like I've got a better made camera.I use the \"type H \" XD card , and get good speed between shots and on tranfers to the PC.I'm very happy with the pictures themselves . { remember to check your \"modes \"}.At this price point, I don't know if you can do better.", "Date": "January 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "untitled", "Author": "Janet Catalona", "ReviewID": "R3JK2E1LRKCWNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's great; never have had a problem; love the video clip aspect.
