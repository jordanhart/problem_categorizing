{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awful Product and No Service", "Author": "Louis F. Davis", "ReviewID": "R3AVAGGV05YURU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The hardware and packaging of this product appeared to be quite good, and installation was straightforward, although the user manual is poorly done. Unfortunately, using the TV interface did not allow viewing of any recorded items. Even though I recorded 3 cameras for long periods of time, the recordings never showed up on the interface and I could not view them. The disk status showed over 12 GB of data on the HDD, but I could not get at it. I tried to install the PC viewing program from the CD but it would not install at all on my Windows XP PC. Tried just plugging the HDD into my PC using the USB cable but my system would not recognize it as a USB hard drive. Tried calling customer service but could not get through and they never called me back.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.99", "Features": "4-channel MPEG4 DVR\nRecords up to 1 year with pre-installed 500GB HD\nConnects directly to your TV or monitor\nIndoor/outdoor cameras with night vision up to 30'\nProfessional installation available powered by installment", "Name": "Night Owl Security Products TIGER-4500 4-Channel MPEG4 Video Security Kit with 4 Night Vision Cameras", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51M9Pk0BQiL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003B5NTW2"}}
