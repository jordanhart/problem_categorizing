A Hayes", "ReviewID": "RGTKJ7RVZS33A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Kodak CX7300 was a steal at $100. I have wanted a digital camera for a while but did not have the money to shell out for one, but I read the reviews and they are all true. For this price you could not find a better camera for beginners or casual users. It is extremely easy to figure out, and after about 30 min-1hour I had mastered my new toy. Battery life seems to be reasonable up to this point and that is great because I plan on using this thing quite frequently. You can take pics in color, black and white or sepia, all giving a good picture quality. I havent bought a memory card yet, but on the lowest quality setting you can snap 67 pics using the internal memory. Using the best quality it can hold 17 pics. I have made some pretty good pics so far even on the lowest setting. There is a night mode with flash for what else but night pics, and the auto setting is for general picure taking with the flash automatically flashing when there isnt enough light in the room. The 1.6 inch lcd screen is cool, giving you the option to review and keep or delete the pics that you take. The camera even has a movie mode where you can take a very small movie clip (without sound). Included with the package is the software you will need to organize and edit your pics on your computer as well as a tutorial to teach you everything you wanted to know about the Kodak CX7300. This camera is so user-friendly though that chances are you will skip the tutorial and be snapping pics very soon after you buy it. So that is all I can say about this camera. It is a great bargain yet high quality product that I would highly recommend to anyone looking to start digital camera-ing that doesnt have a whole lot of money to get it started. I sure am glad I bought one.", "Date": "November 1, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, small quirks", "Author": "NoddingLilith", "ReviewID": "R1GIGJCPOP5ZCS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The CX7300 is the third Kodak camera I have owned, and thus far it has been the best.  The price is great and the camera is very easy to use with a lot of great options.  The Kodak EasyShare Software is some of the best photo software on the market. The camera takes high quality pictures for only being 3.2 mp. I only had a few issues with the camera.  My main problem is that there is no cover for the lens.  Even with the camera turned off you can touch the plastic lens covering.  The second problem I had is that there is also no cover for the connection port on the bottom of the camera.

I have taken more than 150 pictures and batteries are OK. Using the internal memory (16MB) the camera allows you to take up to 67 pictures in low resolution and up to 17 in max resolution (you can choose among 4 options of resolutions). However, I don't think the difference is too high. So I always use it in the low resolution. I have also bought a digital flash card of 256MB (SD256M), for $35, and now it allows me to take 306 pics in max resolution and 1184 in low resolution. It is nice.

I set the camera to 3 stars *** which means best quality and the screen told me I have 306 pics left to take...I don't know about you but that beats a roll of 36 exposure 35mm film anyday (and not to mention the 21 photos per floppy disc with the Mavica).  The auto setting, controls  all settings. I took about 40 shots so far, put the SD card into the SD reader in my computer, without installing the software from the Kodak box that came with the camera ( YOU MUST INSTALL THE SOFTWARE FIRST INTO YOUR COMPUTER BEFORE YOU ATTACH YOUR CAMERA TO YOUR COMPUTER VIA USB CABLE OR DOCKING SYSTEM...KODAK SAYS THIS 4 TIMES IN THE INSRUCTIONS).. and boom there they where, great, clear, crisp and colorfull shots. The indoor shots of things like flowers and people and a few cats where the bomb (that's good).  The outdoor night shots looked like a painting...(thats good too)...OK NOW FOR SOME FACTS: YOU MUST GET THE FOLLOWING WHEN YOU BUY THIS CAMERA...RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES AND RECHARGER...I PCKED UP THE SONY BRAND FOR $19.00 AT AMAZON..KODAK DOES NOT WANT YOU TO USE AA ALKALINES...YOU MUST GET A CASE..$9.00 IN WALLMART OR KMART OR AMAZON...YOU MUST GET A 256MB SD CARD...DONT FOOL AROUND WITH ANYTHING LESS CAUSE YOU'LL LOVE HAVING MEMORY FOR 300 PHOTOS AT BEST QUALITY OR 1000 PHOTOS AT GOOD QUALITY...SD CARD 256MB AROUND $30 AT AMAZON OR WALLMART...EVEN COSTCO....OH ONE MORE THING I GOT FOR THE CAMERA WAS A NECK STRAP, THE WRIST STRAP THAT COMES IN THE BOX IS ...WELL A WRIST STRAP..THE NECK STRAP MUST HAVE THE LOOP AT THE BOTTOM TO ATTACH TO THE CAMERA...ABOUT $9.00 I GOT MINE ON eBAY....

Fontenot \"Prairie Cajun Regenerated!\"", "ReviewID": "R3OCEGBMJZC008", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first digital camera that I have ever owned.  I'll be honest in saying that I was a little uncertain of how to react to this camera when I ordered it from Dell.  Once I received it, however, I came to love the CX7300 very quickly.  It is so easy to use.  Just point and shoot whatever you feel like.  Turn it to auto mode so that it automatically adjusts to get just the right brightness and color.  Use night mode for good shots after dark.  The video mode is also handy, though I purchased this camera primarily for still shots.My first major test for the CX7300 was the final game of the regular season for the Houston Astros.  I was seated along the third base line.  The zoom feature allowed me to get decent shots of the players, especially third baseman Morgan Ensberg and the scoreboard in front of the Crawford Boxes at Minute Maid Park.  Players on second base and beyond became harder to distinguish, but the camera did a great job as far as I'm concerned.  The Astros won the game, as well as the NL Wild Card to make it into the playoffs.  Naturally there was confetti, fireworks, and all-out celebration everywhere in the park.  The camera picked up all of this quite easily.  I probably looked like some kind of freak taking pictures of the confetti, but it was just one other way for the CX7300 to prove its flexibility of use.  Exterior shots of Minute Maid Park came out great.  I even managed to get a shot of one of Houston's finest astride his police horse.I plan on using this camera on any and every trip that I go on in the future.  It's small size, brilliant photo-taking ability and overall ease of use makes it the perfect fit for a roadtrip, ballgame, birthday party, etc.  I highly recommend it for the beginner like myself.  As good as this camera is, Kodak is definitely going to be the first company I look at when it's time to upgrade to a fancier camera.", "Date": "October 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "Happy!

Compared to a higher priced digital camera that I have used, the night time feature on this camera produces grainy pictures.  My main complaint is how fast it goes through batteries.  Be prepared to either spend a small fortune on disposable batteries, purchase no less than two pairs of rechargeable batteries, or at the very least, buy stock in Energizer.  I found that it likes only fresh batteries, so don't expect the camera to operate when you steal the AA's out of the remote control.

The interface is really easy for a beginner to learn.  However, there are two significant drawbacks to this camera.First:  The camera feels like a toy -- it's extremely light and has a plastic body.  I bought this as a gift for my mother (a total beginner) and while she was grateful, even she could tell that this felt \"different\" than the digital cameras we all had.  It felt more like a child's toy -- similar to what you'd expect a Barbie Doll camera for an 8-year old to feel like.Second:  The viewscreen quality is very poor.  When my mother took a picture, she looked at it and asked \"is that what the picture looks like?\"  It was very grainy on the viewscreen -- though it was fine once we uploaded it. I would compare the quality of the viewscreen to what you see on camera phones.In total:  The quality you actually get when you upload is a great bargain for the price.  However, the quality of the camera body and the viewscreen is truly terrible.  That might be ok for some people who care about the final image only.  However, since I bought this as a gift, I now regret this purchase.  I can deal with entry-level etc. I'm not bothered by no optical zoom -- my mother didn't need that. But when the camera itself just feels and looks \"cheap\" it's a problem.Understand these two limitations in your purchase decision.  I would not give this as a gift, as the gift reciever will notice immediately that the camera is far inferior to the cameras s/he has seen other people using.", "Date": "November 24, 2004"}, {"Title": "VERY HAPPY WITH THIS CAMERA!", "Author": "MIRANDA HENDERSON", "ReviewID": "R1MB5BPCHVLVWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS IS MY FIRST DIGITAL CAMERA, AND I AM VERY VERY HAPPY WITH IT.

I do keep it in a bag most of the time.  I used the internal USB connector a few times but have switched to simply pulling the SD card out and using a USB reader, it's much faster.My only gripe about the camera is the redeye.  If the flash is used inside or outside at night, redeye is almost guaranteed.  I don't know if it's because there is no redeye reduction or b/c the flash is so close to the lens.

I really pushed to get a Kodak camera because I have a 3+ year-old DX3500 which still works great and is easy to use.  However, there have been a couple of irritations with this CX7300 and I see at least one complaint already mentioned here.  Unlike my older model, this one doesn't have a cover or even a way to cover the plastic clear lens which covers the actual lens.  Thus, you can easily leave fingerprints or whatever on there and obviously that would affect the photos.  The bigger complaint is that she received a simple camera bag to hold this in and it fits nicely inside if not a little tight.  However, this has caused an annoying problem.  The on/off switch is on the top of the camera and it easily turns on when the camera is put into our pulled out of the camera case.  Albeit, the case didn't come with the camera, however, it was a surprise that the switch could be turned on so easily and often without being aware of it.  The result of this is that batteries tend to die more quickly.  I write this only for the benefit of anyone who purchases this camera to realize they should select a camara carrying case that is not too tight fitting.  I don't really have a solution to offer since I haven't had a chance to take the camera to a store and try other cases.  Maybe another owner of this camera can comment on their success with this.  Also, I would never take a photo without setting the resolution at its highest, thus I would recommend purchasing at least a 128MB or higher memory card.

I never imagined I could get that for $100.  I have been very satisfied with the Kodak CX7300 and would recommend it highly.  But since you are getting it for such a steal, you should also invest in some accessories to make your life easier.A cable and software are included with the camera, so you can download pictures easily by pressing the one-touch \"share\" button (once you have the software loaded on your computer).  But you basically have to download all of your pictures at once and you are using up your batteries somewhat as you do that.  Kodak also makes docking stations that work with all their cameras, but I wanted to get something that could work with other electronic devices as well.  So I also purchased SanDisk ImageMate 5 in 1 Reader (under $20) and a Viking 512 MB Secure Digital Flash Card (under $50 from Amazon) -- which is less than most docking stations.  The storage capacity on the CX7300 alone is very minimal (16MB), so you will definitely want to pick up some type of flash memory card.  512 MB may be more than you need to buy, but it sure makes your life easier.  I actually still have not filled up the card and I've been taking lots of pictures for over a month now.  The SanDisk device makes transferring pictures to any computer easy, since it is just like using an external disk drive that plugs into a USB port.  The combination of the two helps conserve batteries (I still have not changed them) and is very easy to figure out.  I never read a manual on any of this (including the camera, which is very user-friendly), and I wouldn't call myself a \"tech guru\" by any means.One small reservation about the camera's design: the on-switch is a turning wheel on top of the camera and so it can easily turn itself on as you slip it into a pocket or backpack and it rubs against a surface that turns the wheel.  I've often found my camera in the \"on\" position as I took it out.  But this does not seem to have done anything obvious to my battery life, so there may be a sort of sleep mode if it is left on for a long period (I haven't investigated this fully).I'd also recommend you pick up some lithium batteries.  Friends recommended rechargable batteries, but I can't be bothered and the initial cost is discouraging.

There are several flash settings and a delay setting, and a few distance presets.  Strictly the Brownie Hawkeye of today (although the Brownies were much hardier), and thats fine.  You have to know this, and not expect more.  The major failing of this camera is the battery door, which is the most flimsy and hard to shut little thing. I cannot imagine that it will last long if opened frequently. It is really difficult to mash in the battery while closing the tiny plastic door. All the camera buttons, etc., are rather small, but this is standard in digicams. DO NOT DROP this - this is not built to drop - I would not recomend it for active children or active sport, although with constant wearing of the wrist loop and extra care, I have not dropped it.

If you are not a tech wizard, and are confused by too many bells and whistles, this is the camera for you.

If you opt to use a SD card (recommended), don't buy a high capacity 4GB SD card for this camera.  Get a 256 MB card. That's right, 256 Megabyte, NOT Gigabyte. The camera won't be able to format the 4GB SD card.  Using the 256 MB SD card will still provide enough storage for about 300 photos at the highest resolution. If you use the SD card, you can remove it and plug it directly into the card reader on your computer (if you have one).  If you use the camera's internal memory, you will have to use the Kodak cable to transfer the photos to the computer and sometimes the used cameras don't come with the cable.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "wrong items sent on both ends", "Author": "The Alleycat \"I am The Alleycat\"", "ReviewID": "RCFB37COK75HN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This cameria does not fit the kodak easy share CX 7300 this is  the camera dock 3M873/ M883I was told by both ends this canera would workit does not fit AT ALLI would like Bob to send me the correct port for this cameria or refund moneyI am still waiting on the memory cards 3 of them and a battey charger to plug in car and housethis is very importand that I get these items soonboth people were wrong about the cameria fitting in this portPlease take cae of his matterbob send cards 3 memory cards and correct wire to computer and charger for auto and homeI must to a write off on visa if yiu cant send", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "product  verses  management", "Author": "ralph grace", "ReviewID": "RC52X5J93VAC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE ITEM .

This was my first complaint but I figured if that was the only problem then it should work out quite well.To my disappointment I found that not only was the body cheap, it didn't have an optical zoom. For me, this was a huge problem. I like to be able to zoom into my subject without losing the quality that you do from a digital zoom.Then I began snapping shots. Now given it was indoors and the lighting wasn't perfect, the shots I reviewed on the camera's LCD screen were of terrible quality to say the least.Another drawback I noticed was that you cannot move the camera at all while taking the picture and the subject cannot move for a few seconds either or else you'll end up with a blurred and fuzzy bad picture. How unconvienient. Mean't to be a cheap snap and go camera it should at least be quicker in processing the images.When I think of Kodak I think of quality pictures. No longer do I feel this way.

This camera is a toy and a bad one at that.Not only is there no lens cover, there is also no battery life to speak of.  The genius who designed this one put a very easy-to-turn dial at the top of the camera that hangs over the edge just enough so that it turns on no matter where you've put it.  Put it in your bag, take it out and go to turn it on later, you've got dead batteries.  As if the camera didn't eat up enough batteries during normal (non-viewfinder) operation.Since the day I got it (last Christmas), my camera has never been able to read the memory card.  I don't know if it's just the memory card or what (and sorry, but I just can't afford to buy another card to try), but usually when I turn on the camera, with a card inside, the camera will tell me the card needs to be formatted.  If I take the card out and insert it again, with the camera on, it is read fine.  Also, no matter what resolution setting I use, my camera refuses to store pictures on my memory card after the 25th or so picture.  Glad I have a 128mb card.Speaking of the camera's settings, it'd be nice if the camera retained my settings after I turned it off.  I can't leave the camera on for a period of more than three seconds, and it's annoying to have to constantly reset the settings before every single picture.Additionally, there is no zoom to speak off and the flash settings are horrendous.  Also, Kodak's software constantly crashes on my computer (in Windows 2000).  There's no sound on the video (and the video is extremely short, 30 seconds if your batteries are brand new) and the quality of the pictures are ok at best.This camera insults me and I can't wait to get rid of it and buy a Canon.  Spend the extra $20 and buy something good, you won't regret it.  This camera is extremely annoying for anyone, even the most casual user looking to take a few pictures.
