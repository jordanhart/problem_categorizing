User friendly navigation menu, good tips for shooting in different environment.Super fast response time (without flash), driving-mode is excellent, take up to 3 pictures per second and continuely until the internal memory is filled up (more than 12 pictures even with max quality SHQ mode), it allows you to pick which pictures you wanna save from the internal memory before really saving to the xD card.One thing that I don't like is that you can't select the ISO when you turn on the Image Stabilization Mode, as the spec states \"This mode  boosts ISO sensitivity and shutter speed for capturing crisp, clear pictures\", the trade off is the quality of the picture, a lot of noise on the image since high ISO speed is used, if you want to take good quality picture, don't use it.Since ISO can set up to 6400, you can take pictures even in a dark environment, but the same draw back - quality will dramatically drop.", "Date": "October 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "stylish, but lacking some quality", "Author": "phoenix \"phoenix5\"", "ReviewID": "R3CL0P1956EIHU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had originally bought this camera since I was impressed with all the features it came with.  On the plus side, this camera has a lot of scene modes and makes a better than average point-and-shoot.  But after trying some test shoots with dim lighting after setting it to \"night scene,\" I noticed the shots were very grainy.  ISO above 800 had a lot of noise, so I think it was a little silly to have settings up to 6400 ISO on this camera.  Any shots taken at that ISO will be rather poor. I also tried the \"available light\" mode to to compensate for dim lighting conditions, this barely made a difference.  I was also a little disappointed that this camera does not have a wide angle lense.  I would recommend checking out some of the Fuji and Kodak compacts at comparable or lower prices.

This little camera does it all. I comparison shopped for several weeks comparing and contrasting multiple cameras from cannon, kodak, hp, sony, panasonic, and olympus, and none had features like this, a small size, and in this price range. The only advantage above the stylus 710 and 810 is the megapixel count, which does not make up for optical zoom, but can help with photo size if you do blow ups.  It does have a 5x fine zoom also (at 3mpg).10 megapixels, digital image stabilization, 2.5 inch lcd viewing screen, and a low price what you get. OH, DID I MENTION EXCELLENT PICTURES. I have played with this for several days now editing the photos, paling with the on-board and the computer imaging package, and I see nothing wrong with this camera for an everyday average user like me. And with it's weather resistence, nice for a clumsy average user like me. Also the battery life is very adequate, about 120 photos or more, with slide shows, editing ect... This is well worth the investment, saving your families memories in a fit and proper manner.So if you feel you just need more megapixels, go ahead and get this camera for the extra money, but truely the advantages over a 710 or an 810 are minimal.  Check out the new 740's 750's and 760's also.Also, the Olympus Mastersoftware is very easy to use, And with panoramic feature, 3d, and Extra ART Features unlocked by Olympus Brand-Olympus Stamped Type H HD, this camera becomes even more of a pleasure to own. you can edit photos on the computer, or right in the palm of your hand.

Has resulted in more than a few pictures with one corner of 25% of the photo blacked out.3) I find the menu selection to set the camera based on what kind of picture you're taking (landscape, portrait, night portrait, document, etc) offer great options for about anything you want to take - but switching from one to another is really cumbersome with the digital menu options you have to scroll through and choose.All in all - it has served it's purpose admirably for three years, but now I'm replacing it for the above reasons, especially the sticking lens cover.

I bought the Olympus three years ago specifically because of the image stabalization, as it was one of the first cameras to market with it (at that time almost no camera had it), and I figured I could count on the brand.Out of the four cameras that I've had over the last 10 years or so starting with a Kodak 1.5 megapixel, this Olympus is at the bottom of my list.  The image stabilization has not done anything useful on my camera as far as I can tell.  Perhaps it is better with more recent versions? - I don't know.  What I do know is that my pictures are usually coming out worse than friends who have cameras with far fewer megapixels.  Operator error?  Possibly, but I've had digital cameras going back 10 years that I haven't had these problems with.  And the worst of it is that I can't predict when the picture will come out bad.  For example, two shots of the same scene from the same place taken seconds apart might have one good one and one fuzzy one, and I can't tell just by looking at the (unmagnified) image on the back.  The inconsistancy is horrible on this camera.  In anything less than bright light (ie. ballroom or parties), the liklikhood of fuzziness / graininess is high.This camera is smokin'.  Literally.  About every 1 in 10 to 20 shots, again without discernable pattern, when I take a shot, a thin whisp of smoke will ascend from the top right of the camera (from the area around the power button/flash/'take the picture' button).  The first several times, I thought I must be imagining things, but no, it's there.  Then I thought that it means that the camera is on its last leg, but no, the camera has not gotten noticably poorer (except the focusing mechanism).  Go figure, I never heard of this before.The third area of inconsistancy is that the autofocus is completely undependable.  This includes upon startup (such as when I spot a passing momentary scene - I am usually quick on the draw to bring the camera up, but often it is all for naught because the camera can't get its focusing done in time to take the pic).  Even when I have pre metered (by holding down the 'take the picture' button down halfway) I will often get this behaviour, such as when I prepare for the action shot of, say, someone jumping over a crevasse, and then ... all that risk for nothing.  On this point (autofocus), the camera does seem to have degraded over time.I'm fine with the camera weight and body.  The external hardware is fine for me.  Sometimes I take photos as I am clinging to a rock wall with one hand, camera in the other - so one handed operation works for me.Olympus is a well respected brand.  It should be offering rock solid dependability, but I am sorry to say they really dropped the ball with this (at the time) flagship camera.  I have missed many good imprompteau shots because of the autofocus issue, and so much more than that because of the random fuzziness generator.

I record the before, during and after conditions.  This record of what is existing, what is in the walls and ceiling and under the floor have saved me on more than one occasion.  The quality of 10 Megapixel CCD and image stabilization make it easy to get the qaulity I'm looking for.  The fact that the camera is small and light weight makes it easy to fit in the shirt pocket when I need both my hands of other things.  The all-weather construction helps to keep the camera in good working order for when I need it.  The Quick Time movie mode has been helpful on several occasions.  Oh, and a termite can almost fill the photograph, and boy does that make for an interesting conversation with a homeowner.

I was thrilled with my pictures--only a few blurry ones early on. And you know right away and can retake the picture. I used this camera to document summer reading programs for a library--so lots of kids moving around--indoor pictures, outdoor pictures, low light levels in the museum--all pictures came out great. A number of the pictures were even printed in area newspapers. A higher optical zoom would have been nice but at 10 megapixels I could enlarge the pictures on the computer and practically show finger prints and still have a crystal clear image.

I can give it to my daughter (who knows nothing about cameras) for a trip, or an evening, and she makes the shots look like a pro did it.
