Excellent price for this camera and kit. I will use it for advertising my business. I have the iPhone 4s, which is hard to beat. But this camera is very sharp and I use the camera connection kit to load pics to my iPad HD. I am an amateur photographer, so this does the work for me. This camera was exactly what I was looking for. Very happy. Oh yeah, the seller is excellent also.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung PL170 Is the prefect camera", "Author": "FAX Master", "ReviewID": "R3LH2IBRK3DGB7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this little hand size camera.
