{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Hardware works like a charm, software has bugs", "Author": "D. Dunn", "ReviewID": "RQ3SBO8OO7O34", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well I have owned this for 2 months now.I live in Taiwan, so it is imperative to record your driving since only about 10% of the drivers follow any type of traffic laws.  The problem I now face is that the software will not play back the video or convert it to MP4 format for archiving and future use.The manufacturer has answered my emails (albeit slowly) and aknowledged that the software supplier (blackbox) has documented that the software is not really comaptable with Win 7 or Vista (32 or 64 bit).They have promised to keep me up to date on the software issue.The hardware works great and apparently records everything (because I cannot view it to verify this).  The gps is fairly stable as far as the voice prompt goes, and it picks up a gps lock when my Garmin fails to do so.Once I get an operational viewing software from the manufacturer I will update this review.I have had some issues with 32GB SDHC cards as they work for about 3 days and then the recorder fails to recognize them anymore until they are reformatted.  I have had the same issues with 16 GB SDHC cards as well.  The happy median seems to be 8GB SDHC cards as it has been in place for 2 weeks and I have not had an error yet.  I have several class 8, 6 and class 4 SDHC cards laying around and I have tried them all and everything above 8GB errors out after 2-3 days of use and is unrecognized by the device.  All of the cards are name brand and lifetime warranteed.  I even had the device fry one of my 32 GB class 10 cards, but the SDHC supplier replaced it without question and verifeid that the recording device had over voltaged the card, and destroyed the SDHC unit.  I guess the lower quality 8GB cards can take a wider voltage variance where the higher capacity cards are more precise and sensitive to current and voltage variances.I recomend this product as long as they can get the software operational.  I am sure it will work with XP 32 bit, but I don't have any available machines runing that OS right now.", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ok, but still looking for better product", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "R32FFGPBEBUSRD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm getting frustrated with weak products.  I purchased this hoping it would be better then the DR200 in car camera I have been using with my training vehicles.  The website and videos say the quality is better (recording specifically).  However both cameras have a grainy video quality, nothing like the sample videos I've seen.  It gets to be a pain always trying a product and going through the hassle of returning it.  Why cant thing just work the way they are claimed to work ???", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this junk....", "Author": "Robert Lapointe \"RLP2010\"", "ReviewID": "RZ82C8HPO9BC5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Out of the package it is good but it only works on the Windows platform and not MAC. As I drive it constantly tells me that the memory card is not recognized and I have to turn the unit off and then back on again for it to work. The memory card is the one which came with the unit so I'm not sure why this keeps happening. Overall this product needs some work. It needs to be MAC compatible for sure.
