Accessories were as follows: Screen Protector, Cleaning Kit, Card Reader, Tripod, Camera Bag and Wallet for SD card.First let me talk about what i like:1. Camera is great, genuine Canon 60D2. Lens are perfect3. Shipping was very fast, ordered it on a Thursday evening and got it Monday of the following week (less than two business days). Free shipping. It arrived at least two days before the slotted time.4. Extra Battery was a wonderful surprise, so if you are thinking of buying a battery grip there is already two batteries made available.5. The Protective Screen is nice as wellThings that were disappointing:1. The BAG is awful, looks nothing like picture, so don't use the picture to determine the bag you will get. The bag has basically no padding. I put the camera and lens in the bag and it just moved around in the bag. The lens were hitting on each other and hitting on the camera. No side pockets, No front Pockets, just one big compartment to push everything in. A school bag is better than the bag. BAG WAS VERY VERY LOW IN QUALITY.2. The tripod isn't very strong either, for such an expensive camera, i am already afraid to use the tripod.So when you make this purchase, don't expect a good camera bag or tripod. Everything else is perfect.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Startup Bundle", "Author": "JeMichael", "ReviewID": "R37DGPLIP0D6RH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Customer service From This Company and Great bundle (great startup package- for anyone that wants to know the sd card is a class 6)...

I was advised to go with a smaller camera, but have had my heart set on this one since I started seeing it in different photography magazines.I got to really test it out at the Detroit Auto Show on January 22, 2011 and my photos turned out really crisp and clear. The tilt LCD screen really helped out too. I have a really awesome photo of the injection stacks on top of a racing engine that I had to use the tilt screen for. Talk about an awesome feature.The entire package is really great and has almost everything I need to start my classes. I've even recommended a similar package to a classmate!I love it and look forward to learning more about it!", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS 60D = Best Purchase Ever!", "Author": "T and E", "ReviewID": "R1Z1VZY0BYGBY7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Canon EOS 60D with a two lens package (18-55mm and 55-250 telephoto) along with a few accessories, a memory stick, camera bag, tripod, etc. First, I absolutely LOVE my camera. It arrived ahead of schedule, everything was included like it said, the camera was obviously brand new, and with TWO lenses...the price was perfection. My only complaints, however, revolve around the quality of the \"extra stuff.\" My camera bag buckle has already snapped, the tripod is really super cheap, and the included memory stick is too slow for the speed at which I shoot. Nevertheless, the price was/is so great that it doesn't matter because I saved so much for the camera and lenses that the other stuff doesn't even matter. It's a great starter kick, and when considering the price I can still afford the bag I want, and I already own a great tripod. If you're looking for an EOS 60D...this was the best deal ever!", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "NBC, eat your heart out.", "Author": "Tommy Jordan", "ReviewID": "R1SVQQS0TFVU0V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Camera Body:I'm in LOVE with this camera. The HD video clarity is stunning! I've got footage from ABC and NBC B-roll stored here on my PC from their interviews and when you play their side-by-side with my footage.. it's just as compelling and just as vivid and clear. I love it! Their cameras cost around 50 thousand. Mine didn't!The photo capabilities for still-shots are just as powerful, much more so than I've yet to master. It's going to take me a long time and a lot of studying to get fully away from the \"auto\" features, but I'm trying. Things like aperture priority and shutter priority take time to get used you. If you set A to auto, then you have to manually configure B and C. If you set B to auto, you have to manually configure A and C, or you can manually configure A, B, C as well as zoom and focus...It's a lot to master in the professional mode, but if you're just looking for amazingly-awesome clarity, it shoots AWESOME in the auto-modes as well. It's easy enough to use that my wife and kids love taking photos with it just for fun. The \"action\" mode is capable of shooting until the memory fills up. I haven't tried to see how many photos that actually is yet, but it's more than I've needed for anything. Just press and hold the shutter and click-click-click-click, rapid fire until you release it.I can't say enough positive things about this camera.Camera Bag:I read reviews stating the camera bag was crap. I disagree whole-heartedly. No, it's not GREAT for a professional photographer, because it isn't big enough, but it's got enough storage for the beginning amateur, is well crafted, and nicely padded. I'm happy with it.Tripod: The tripod is OK for your small point-and-shoot cameras, but I would NEVER put a heavy-bodied Canon with a 200mm lens attached on it. It's too flimsy. Having said that, I just sold the tripod online to get a few bucks back.It includes a 16gb SDHC card, which was very nice of them. Set on the camera's maxiumum quality JPG setting, each photos is between 6-11mb in size, depending on your setting at the time. That's plenty of space for hundreds of stills and a good amount of video.I didn't realize it at the time but it comes with a spare battery, so you get two batteries as well as a wall/mobile charger. Very nice there too!Overall I couldn't be more impressed at the cost savings. I priced this camera and the parts separately and there was no way I could beat the package pricing offered here. I'll DEFINITELY buy from these guys again. Their customer service was unparalleled on Amazon.

Came in 1 day early.1. Camera - On its original box, Brand NEW!2. Lenses - Both lenses in a box, one on a canon packaging and the other is white box which i believe its an original packaging for bundles, they are well packed.3. SD Memory Card is class 10, though its not a known brand but it works.4. Tripod - hmmmm, give it to your kids to play with, dont trust it. If you can buy $1000 worth of a camera, you can affort $150 more for a dependable tripod.5. Case - Zeiko's, its alright but i would suggest you to invest couple of bucks for a better one.6. also included, Zieko's lens tools, Zeiko's Mini Tripod, Zeiko's LCD scratch protectors (3), Extra Battery LP-6E, HDMI Cable, Zieko's Memory Card Reader and Wallet.Packaging was tight and strong. I am loving my camera and Im learning how to use it fast.On the picture was i think a book or a CD entitle \"Guide to SLR Camera\" - Thats not included.

I guess its my fault that I didn't review my packing slip better... But now I'm severely disappointed. Although, they did send a generic EOS Rebel battery as my extra battery, I emailed them that it was the wrong battery and they promptly send me the right battery and told me to keep the Rebel battery as well. That worked out because I also own that camera. If you buy this bundle, you won't be disappointed with what you get, IF you get what you are suppose to.

The camera is brand new, un-opened, and not a knock-off.The lenses are cheap--and the 18-55 lens is the bottom of the barrel as far as Canon lenses are concerned. Slow focus, loud, and not 'fast' but it does the job in most situations. I like that Canon's low end lenses all have IS now--great for video.Getting an extra battery, 16GB card, lens and card reader are nice additions. The rest of the items (bag, tripod, etc.) are cheap and throw-aways (or something for the kids to play with).There is a book featured in the Amazon photo (\"Guide to Digital SLR Cameras\") which didn't arrive with the kit, but I didn't want it anyway :)If you're starting out and want a great kit with a lot of accessories you may or may not need, this is a great deal and I'd do it again!", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Average kit.", "Author": "SND", "ReviewID": "R2EZMHNFDKT2QN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is great and original.
