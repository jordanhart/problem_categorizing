Lorexs' tech support is a joke.  When you get ahold of them, they do not know what to do.  They refer you to a level two tech.  He will call you right away.  We are still waiting.What this system does do; is continually lock up our computer.  It locks it up so bad, all you can do is reset it.  Forget using the program manager.  It locks it up so bad, nothing works except the reset button.The computer we have this system on is no slouch; by any means.  It is based on an 845 Intel mother board; 2.67 gig, Pentium 4.  Audigy 2 sound card, 2 gigs of 333/mhz Double Data Rate memory; 8500 ATI Radeon video card; running XP with service pack 2.This is the only program, or hardware we have a problem with on this computer.  When the Lorex system works at all, it severely slows down the entire computer.  After a couple hours, it generally crashes the system.We have at least 30 calls into their tech line.  What a waste of time.  Every time they say; well we will escalate this to a level 2 tech.  They will call you this after noon, or tomorrow morning, etceteras...  Yeah right.  Were still waiting on the first call.  The best their tech has done so far; is recommend we return the system.At this point we have at least twenty five hours invested in installing the cameras, wiring, etcetera....  What an absolute waste.  But since the last time it crashed our system, we have no sound card; which up to that point, has always worked fine.Now we have to repair the sound card.Calling Tiger Direct & requesting a return authorization really looks like an excellent idea.  At this point, we are dialing the phone, before this worthless piece of junk does any more damage to our system.Our condolences to anyone who was/is foolish enough to buy this system.Mod70xtrUpdate: We finally got a RMA # from Tiger Direct.  What a Blessing to be able to get rid of this system.Mod70xtr", "Date": "February 2, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Instantly turns your PC or laptop into a remote-surveillance station\nIncluded color camera is weatherproof\nAllows access to live or recorded video from any network-connected PC\nFeatures alarm notification via telephone, pager, or email\nIncludes RCA to USB video-grabber and DVS application software", "Name": "Lorex DVM-2051 Digital Video Security System", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HG3AZ35GL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000792SAY"}}
