We didn't have much time for shopping during our trip to the U.S. this summer, so we did the research via internet and purchased this pack with some apprehension. My husband had planned to go to a camera store and \"talk to an expert\" as he's always done in the past. But he's very pleased with his new camera and finds the choice of accessories very useful. And on top of it he saved time and effort, and Amazon delivered very quickly. We couldn't be more satisfied!", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lumix  FZ100", "Author": "D. K.
