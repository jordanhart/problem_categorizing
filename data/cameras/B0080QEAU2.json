{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great camera!", "Author": "reviewer", "ReviewID": "RC4JSSDNQSBF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera.  Took to the beach for our first real use, and pictures were sharp and clear.  This camera has a lot of settings for different lighting and locations, but also allows for some custom settings if you know what you're doing.  The panoramic picture setting is a great feature.  The only negative I have found thus far is that when shooting videos, there is quite a bit of background noise, like a really quiet white noise.  Also, the manual mentions this, but sometimes you can hear the camera zooming in and out on videos.  Overall, great camera and very satisfied.  Hope to get much use from this camera and work our way up as we learn.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great gift choice for a casual photographer", "Author": "Lexiconefx", "ReviewID": "RMW9SGJJQFMDK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this as part of a package deal for my daughter on Christmas.  It came with the memory card and case.  It was a good value for the money and takes fantastic pictures, even with the zoom function, which is usually lousy on most of these cheaper cameras.  I would recommend this for casual photographers who don't want to bother with the features that are offered by package and SLR cameras.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not impressed", "Author": "Floyd Jones", "ReviewID": "R24TXO1G3ZC6JK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It has not been a year, and this camera is not working properly. The lens will not extend and the camera errors out. I am currently making a attempt to see if it is a warranty or something so I can have it replaced. It has not been dropped or wet or anything, it just started malfunctioning. You may want to make a different purchase then this one.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "The reason for the good price:", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "RLGBA7D448HLE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I do like that it has the rapid fire option (which is why I bought it), as well as a good price.. But as the customer support at Fujifilm told me: It was among the first to offer some of these options, so you cannot adjust the shutter speed, or a few other things --they simply depend on the memory card capacity and image size in settings. Therefore, small/lower quality images if you want the fast action shots.", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "so far its great", "Author": "A.
