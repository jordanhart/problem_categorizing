{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Loads of features and great quality photos", "Author": "Biff Malibu \"biffmalibu\"", "ReviewID": "R33A7JMJV5FGJC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I'd have given five stars except for the following peculiarity.When you switch on this camera, the lens extends a very short amount (not beyond the lens housing but very close to it). Unfortunately, if the lens cap is in place, the lens jams against the cap and you can't remove it. The camera will alert you to shut it off. There's no mention of this in the abbreviated paper manual that's included (it is mentioned in the full manual which you only get in a PDF on the CD, another negative in my opinion). A \"conventional\" lens cap (one that goes over the entire housing) will fix this problem, but finding one might be tricky.Okay, that out of the way...I've only had this camera for a few days but I've gone through most of the features and taken a number of sample shots. I'm very impressed with the quality of the zoom, even near the maximum. Naturally the light gathering is less at full extension but it's very usable. The quality of the photos is fantastic, especially for the price. The stabilization feature works well, better than I expected.You can choose between aperture priority or shutter speed priority if you prefer, or just point and click. It focuses fast and writes to the memory fairly quickly (of course that may vary depending on several factors).A nice touch is the \"F\" button which allows you to quickly change several popular settings (such as ISO) in any mode.It's a great buy but remember to take the lens cap off!", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "great beginner camera especially for the price", "Author": "SGT. PJ ONeil", "ReviewID": "R33IGCX724WHSL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in Iraq from Aafes because I wanted something more than a little point and shoot. I am not a pro, but I have taken a lot of great pictures so far. It is great for someone looking for just a better all around camera or for someone who is wanting to take photography on as a hobby. I have taken pictures from everything from in my blackhawk over Baghdad to creative shots and they came out great. If you turn it on with the lens cap on it sticks and you have to turn it back off and take the cap off first. You can't change lenses but i have found a 72 mm filter adapter(Ebay from a lady's online photoshop, I forget the name though) which is pretty fun. Easy to use auto settings plus some cool manual settings a little more advanced, but it is good if you are not a pro and looking to take it up as a hobby, definately a great starter camera!!! I am having a great time and can't wait to get back stateside to get some better photo ops, lol. It takes 4 AA batteries which run out after a couple days of use. I ordered some rechargable NIMH batteries and those are great. The zoom is really good and the macro/super macro setting is pretty good too. It has a Electronic View Finder which has proven useful already, you can switch between that and the LCD screen. I haven't had too much luck with any night shots, but I think that is because of my inexperience so far. It has a really fun panorama sweep setting on it that stitches pretty great. Plenty of pre-set scenes to choose from on auto, but there is also enough manual setting you can toy with for some creative stuff, shutter speed, aperture, etc. For the price you cannot find a better deal and better quality in my opinion, unless you want to spend $200-$300 more just for a name. I love it and would recommend it to any amateur.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased", "Author": "Woody \"Wood Chuck\"", "ReviewID": "R1IQK98CEYCY64", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had this camera for about a week and I am very pleased. Takes very good quality pictures, even with an active six year old, and the movies are great too with digital or Optical zoom. I also like the EVF and an LCD to choose from.It's a rather large camera a little smaller than my Cannon T-50, 35 MM camI tried a Nikon L120 with too many blurred pics and NO EVF so I returned it.This cam blows it out of the water. The lens cap was kind of annoying at first But got used to it.Remember for faster pic shots get you a class 6 or faster SD Card.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great step-up from a compact point-and-shoot.", "Author": "Sara Spaedy \"Everything will be fine.\"", "ReviewID": "R2CAZ9HWD8YRXE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After shopping around for what type of camera I wanted to replace my traditional film SLR Pentax ZX-L Date AF SLR (Body Only) AND my compact digital point-and-shoot Fujifilm FinePix J20 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom, this is the one I decided on.I wanted a camera that had the simplicity and automatic functions of my little FinePix J20, but also had the options for manual/customized settings that my 35mm had. This had all the features that I wanted, plus the familiar interface and quality that I know from Fujifilm.I have only had the camera for an evening, so this will just be a preliminary review, but I have already gotten some pretty nice shots. As soon as I master all the settings and get to know the camera a little better, I'm sure the masterful photos will be pouring off of the memory card. ;-)My first impression of the camera is its size. It is MUCH smaller and lighter than my 35mm SLR. The screen is big and beautiful at 3\". It fits well in my hands. (I am a woman with average-sized hands, not large or small.) The neck/shoulder strap that's included feels a little sparse compared to the wide band I am used to with my 35mm SLR, but since the camera is so much lighter, I'm sure it's sufficient.The placement of the buttons couldn't be better. The location and spacing is very intuitive and I've already memorized where they all are in just one evening's use. I will criticize the buttons on my impression of their quality and ruggedness. The camera's body is entirely plastic and the buttons are plastic, too. But I feel as if the buttons are not as durable as the rubberized camera body. With the wheel and shutter release button particularly, there seems to be a lot of \"play\" in the housing of the button on the camera body. This is just compared to my experience with my other cameras, and I am used to the feeling of these buttons after using the camera, but my first impression was to be concerned for their fragility.The EVF (Electronic View Finder) is neat and will be very handy in bright-sunny-day situations, but the quality of the image in that tiny screen is good, but not great. NOTE: It is not a proper optical viewfinder, nor is it the precise reflection of an SLR's mirror, but I can tell I am going to appreciate it. Plus, it will definitely save your battery life!Speaking of battery life, the camera runs on 4 AA batteries and comes with a set of alkalines to get you started. I definitely recommend purchasing a couple sets of NiMHs and a charger. That being said, I have taken more than 100 photographs with the camera this evening and fiddled with the settings constantly and the original alkaline batteries are still doing fine. Just be sure and have some spares, because that beautiful LCD and the powerful long-range zoom's motors are going to suck 'em dry.As with any advanced piece of technological equipment, do not expect to take it out of the box and witness yourself turn into Ansel Adams. No piece of equipment can turn a bad photo opportunity into a good one. I have gotten crisp, \"well-exposed\" images with zero noise and beautiful colors by paying attention to the settings on my camera. There's no way around it!I recommend you search online and download a PDF version of the manual for free! Read through it a couple times before ever ordering your camera to make sure it has all the features you want/need. Go to the library and pick up a book on basic digital photography techniques. You'll be amazed with what you can accomplish with even the simplest features of a point and shoot camera (let alone an advanced digicam like this one!) if you know some basics.As I use the camera I will update this review with specific experiences.EDIT:After a few days with the camera, one thing is for sure! The manual mode takes WAY better pictures than the automatic mode, especially indoors. On the automatic setting, the SR setting and the SP setting, the camera tends to set the ISO much too high, resulting in images that contain digital noise. I wish there was a way to cap the ISO in settings other than P, S, A, and M settings. The solution? Set an ISO, aperture and shutter speed etc. in M mode and save it to your custom setting. Use this setting for indoor snapshots. The Auto, SR and SP settings work great outdoors/in good light.The Manual mode (M) claims to allow you to set shutter speed and aperture, but the camera judges the aperture for you and gives you a choice of two, sometimes three!, f-stops that you must choose from. You can set the shutter speed to any fraction of a second down to 1/2000th. The slowest shutter speed is 8 seconds. A bulb setting would be nice, but not many will have a need for it (including me).The flash is manual-release only, which is nice sometimes and marginally inconvenient in others. I prefer not to use the flash unless I have to, but I am used to a camera (my Pentax 35mm SLR) that pops up the flash if it \"decides\" it ought to fire. I then have the option of holding the flash down physically (it is conveniently located to do so) if I do not want the flash to fire for the shot.I have taken about 3-400 pictures and have fiddled extensively with settings and I've yet to replace the alkaline batteries that came with the camera or even receive a battery level indicator on the screen.The pictures are GREAT! and I love all of the settings that I get to adjust in Manual mode. VERY awesome. The flash is flattering, in my flash experience and I am really enjoying the F-button, which is kind of a convenient short-cut menu access button in either playback or shooting mode. The zoom is AAAA-MAZING!! I have yet to try movie mode and I am looking forward to purchasing a tripod to take some night shots. (The camera has a slow-synchro flash setting to take night shots with those cool trails. Can't wait for the State Fair this summer!)EDIT:After much more experience with the camera, I can say I am totally satisfied. Once you get familiar with the settings, the camera (ANY camera) becomes an extension of your vision, and this camera is great! Images are beautiful and battery life is great. You won't regret buying it as long as you're willing to learn the skills to use it.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for 5x3.5in prints, no larger in my view", "Author": "kilimanjaro", "ReviewID": "R3U7AC5YPN8VFA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have bought this camera after my previous old 5MP Sony DSC-F707 camera created some problems with memory card detection. I read the reviews on the Fuji FinePix S3300 here and elsewhere and it seemed to be a good price/quality choice, so I went on and bought it from Amazon. It arrived within a week and I started taking pictures.It soon became clear that the pictures are of a worse quality than those from my previous 5MP model (which cost me about \u00a3500 back in 2002), with some apparent loss in sharpness, but then I thought the price of the Fuji FinePix S3300 was much lower, so the lower picture quality is probably what I have to take despite the significant increase in pixel size to 14MP (which I naively took as a guarantee of good picture quality when deciding to buy it).When I was looking for the reasons for this, I was first checking for whether I might be causing this myself by somehow moving the camera when shooting, so I mounted it on a solid tripod to take test pictures.  This was not the cause as the blur and watercolor-like artifacts remained. Then I checked the focusing system and took many test pictures in the outside with infinity focus from a tripod. The artifacts remained. Then I was checking whether selecting smaller apertures might increase the sharpness by increasing the picture depth, where sharpness is maintained. The artifacts remained. Finally, after some research on the internet, I found out that this is probably due to the Fuji algorithm for JPEG compression and that this is actually a common feature across many Fuji digital camera types.The artifacts are detectable at higher resolution and can to some degree be minimised by taking pictures at the highest resolution mode (\"Fine\") and choosing the largest format (\"Large\"), which was recommended to me in a shop, where I went to discuss this. Sharpness can be further increased by selecting the \"Sharp\" mode in the menu, but this results in some other unwanted artifacts in the pictures, so it is usable only for selected shots (not recommended for any scenes with trees without leaves as the individual twigs then become unnatural). Still, even with all these adjustments, which makes each picture take around 6MB on a memory card, the pictures are suitable for printing at only a maximum size of 5x3.5 inches, otherwise the artifacts start to show up. Also, one cannot look up details by zooming into the pictures as the artifacts prevent discerning any details at higher magnifications.It is a good camera for small printout sizes for someone who has no higher photographic ambitions, as it has many other features to help get nice shots, but the picture size/quality ratio is probably too high for me to recommend this one.Does anyone of you recognize this and was it a problem for you?11.3.2012:  After experimenting a lot and reading a lot about cameras of this type, I came to a conclusion that what I experience with this camera might be a combination of four factors:  first, the sensor in this camera is really tiny (7.7 mm diagonal size) with a very high pixel number on a very small area, which does not help. Second, the compression algorithm may cause some of the artifacts.  Third, it seems that the automatic picture stabilisation is not optimal, at least not on mine.  Finally, the autofocus is somewhat unreliable, especially in low light conditions.  Put all four together and an issue may arise.22.4.2012:  I have now done some more work with the camera.  I now always use a tripod with this camera and some of the previous sharpness problems have improved to some degree.  The artifacts are still there, but I found out that the best detail can be captured (somewhat counterintuitively) when using the \"soft\" mode in the sharpness menu options.  Autofocus is not very good or reliable and the camera does not have manual focus, so this cannot be corrected.  An additional problem is that when I manage to get a properly focused and sharp image, the corners of the image are still out of focus ... this is obviously a lens issue.  I now use this camera for pictures documenting the building of my house for archiving purposes, without any artistic ambitions.  Good camera for this goal, but when I was a small boy, almost any camera I used (except for a very low price) managed to produce good sharp pictures on negatives, so this is a standard I am (or was) used to, which is not matched by this camera.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fuji FinePix S3300 Review", "Author": "Matthew \"Foto\" Spence", "ReviewID": "R17DAQY8P0VI39", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This thing is absolutely awesome.
