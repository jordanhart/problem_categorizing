The first shock is the battery charger is huge, no little plug-in like the Canon system.  Second, camera feels very cheaply made, 95% plastic feel.  But the deal killer is pictures!  When I turn off the flash and just take pictures under the natural light; they all turned out orange!!!!  I pulled out my Canon SD 1300, and there was no comparison.  The Canon sensor grabs the available light and makes interesting pictures, sometimes they are great.  But 100% orange washout by the RZ-18, I was re-packing it for return in 35 minutes.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.95", "Features": "3-inch LCD display\n18X optical zoom ( 25-240mm equivalent) with slim foot print\nLarge and a 4cm super macro mode\nWidescreen HD video in 720p @ 30 fps.
