I have been looking for an entry level SLR for awhile and finally settled on the T4i.  I ordered my camera around Christmas and thought that there would be more of a delay in shipping.  I was pleseantly surprise when an Amazon box was on my front door step the day after Christmas.  I priced out the T4i at Best Buy, National Camera, and Costco.  The body and two main lenses (18-55 and 55-250) would have been over $900 dollars alone.

You can't say no to it, there are some stuff you can probably do without, but with the price its a steal!! I received it a lot earlier then I anticipated, I was like a little kid in the candy store.

I love the fact that the two main lenses are from Canon rather than a cheaper make, which turned me away from similar packages. The camera's great--I've taken it out a couple weekends now to get used to settings. Everything fits well into the backpack as well, with a little room to spare. I haven't yet used the tripod, but it seems stable and well-built. My only complaint is that the wide angle/telephoto lenses don't quite fit, even with the adapters; not sure if that's me, or the lenses, but it should be easy enough to get other adapters.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great deal!", "Author": "itsbec", "ReviewID": "RN8HV30R50M6P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After lots of searching, I think this is the best deal out there on this camera!

Compensate with wide aperture and good lighting. If you know your video stuff you should be able to produce high quality footage, however \"moiring\" on detailed surfaces, like water on a pond, is a bugger to remove in post. Great kit though, use the telephoto all the time. However the vivitar adapters cause quite a bit of distortion and the pictures appear more \"muddled\" when used. Had this camera for 1 year and I'm breaking down and buying a Full Frame to get the wide shots I want. Wonderful camera to cut your teeth on, as well as produce great content for the pro user.

This bundle is really good! My friend was scaring me saying what if you don't get the genuine lenses and other things. Well, I got this and everything was exactly as described. If you try pricing out the items individually it will cost you more. So figure out what you think you will need and then if you need majority of the items, this is a great deal.

Fleischman", "ReviewID": "R1IC768I66FPZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Canon Rebel T4i is my first DSLR.  For a decade I used a Canon PowerShot G-1, which was a good all-purpose camera for its era.  The jump from 3.3 MP to 18 MP was a perfect move for me, a long-time amateur photographer (50 years).The T4i has so many features, I'd recommend downloading the user manual in .pdf format before purchasing.  It helped me decide between the T4i and the Canon 60D.  The old PowerShot G1 was extremely slow compared to the T4i.  And the G1 ate battery power rapidly with the LCD screen in use.  Not so with the T4i.I followed my son's youth baseball team's games for 2 months, capturing some great candid portraits and many great action shots (my opinion :-)).  My main subjects are landscapes, sports action, wildlife, night shots, table tops, and automobile photo shoots.With a little research in the user manual, the T4i does all those (and more that I haven't explored yet) admirably. Most of the time, I use the P mode.  Auto tends to employ the built in flash at unexpected times, so I program the camera to not flash unless I want it to.I bought the photive camera battery grip to go with, and it is an excellent addition to the T4i, balancing the camera and the 55-250 mm IS lens very well.I already had a good tripod, so I gave the one in the kit away, it being a wee bit light for the T4i with battery grip attached.The card reader is handy, avoiding having to attach the camera to my computer.Over all, the Canon EOS Rebel T4i kit is the best purchase I've made this year.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for everyday and professional photography!", "Author": "mandytrimm", "ReviewID": "R3VBR7KE8D8AKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a digital artist and stock artist, and photographer hobbyist so I need the best quality photos I can take. I'm not a photography major (unlike all my friends) so I won't try to explain all the brilliance of this camera and it's equipment (as they all could). I WILL say it arrived in perfect condition with ALL items listed in description.All the manuals are very helpful in learning the basics and if you grab the 'For Dummies' book it's basically a snap. For the most part you don't even HAVE to read the manual! I started playing with it straight out of shipping and picked up on what everything did in a couple hours. So basically decently easy to use and learn with simple practice.I use it all every day and have had no problems whatsoever. The lenses are fantastic and allow me a large range of zooming capabilities and high detailed photos. Pictures are very large, very crisp/detailed, and beautiful. My clients/models, friends and family are impressed with the photos I am able to take and the quality of them as much as I am. Definitely a great buy. Definitely worth every cent. If you are going to do pro photography and stock photography and you can fit it in your budget this is definitely a camera worth owning.The backpack holds everything in this bundle and THEN SOME. I love it so much! It's so easy to put everything away and get everything out in limited time. It feels really sturdy and seems to protect my gear from breaking even from a hard fall (experience tells me this). The memory card holds over 400 photos for me at over 5000px a photo. The filters are a must to keep on your lenses. The zoom efficiency on the lenses are fantastic! And the tripod is very sturdy and great! I use the tripod religiously when I do my stock photography.Everything is in great condition and works perfectly. Unfortunately as helpful as i can get.

Go on you tube and search for Canon T4i test videos to see what I'm talking about.
