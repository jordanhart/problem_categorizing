{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The ultimate ELPH. Next generation maturity.", "Author": "Jim Krupnik \"jkrupnik\"", "ReviewID": "R14JUIICQVQBBQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the S-400 to upgrade from the S-200 that I have been using since it was made available. I love the S-200, as it is both durable and handy. It has also become a great value with recent price reductions. On the other hand, I wanted to get the most recent tech advances in the smallest package, so the S-400 was the clear choice.Here are my initial impressions, and some of the improvements / differences between the 200 and the 400. First of all, Canon has paid close attention to the nits and picks of users of the earlier cameras in the ELPH line. Aside from the addition of cutting edge developments, there have been subtle changes that greatly increase it's ease of use. This is an incredible camera built into a compressed case. Except for being ever so slightly thicker than the S-200, it is the same  cigarette pack size.It has a 4 mega pixel sensor, and it is quick and accurate. Color saturation and contrast are outstanding. The lens is very sharp from edge to edge (I tested at various light levels from macro mode (1.5\") to infinity focus, and it consistantly produced remarkably fine images). 8x10 prints are outstanding. Period. At long shutter speeds (up to 15 sec), the sensor is remarkably free from \"noise\". In fact, it does better than many SLR style digicams in all areas of picture quality.The 3x optical zoom is a welcome addition. Now you can take a proper head an shoulders portrait without invoking the relatively lossy digital zoom, or suffering from the effects of distorted facial features caused by getting too close with a too short lens. When you need it though, the digital zoom offers up to 11x total zoom power, and returns pretty good results as digital zooms go. The 400 retains the special effects lineup of the 200, and they work very well. The tonal range of the black & white option is a real treat. The final result isn't exactly Panatomic X quality, but it is really good, and your darkroom for artistic dodging and burning is contained entirely on your hard drive.The case is still steel, but has a ceramic coating that is supposed to be even more scratch resistant. It is also much \"whiter\", and offers MUCH better contrast when you read the various control labels. While the contols are similar, they are also marked with larger and bolder lettering. All in all, a big improvrment. The michrophone was moved from the front to the top of the case. I think the front makes more sense, but it works very well on top. Canon also included a tiny (but effective) speaker in the 400. You can now select or create sounds for all camera functions (even a \"real\" shutter sound), as well as make voice notes for each photo taken if desired. Most sound functions are individualy adjustable for volume, and several sound \"themes\" are included. Techno-tinkerers might enjoy customizing the photo displayed upon startup. Movie preview also has sound now.On the subject of movies, the 400 makes a little tradeoff. The max resolution is no longer 640x480, it is 320x240 (which is fast becoming standard for movies from still cameras). On the other hand, it is not limited to 10 seconds anymore. You can now make clips up to 3 minutes each. Computer playback looks very good. TV playback isn't bad at all. As a pocket sized way to film Junior taking his first bike ride without training wheels, it can't be beat.The shutter button and zoom ring are a little larger, and now feel just right. The 400 has also incorporated the mode selector wheel used on other high end Canon cameras. This is long overdue, as it makes using all of the many features and modes a real joy.Red eye appears to be better than before, but I don't expect much from such a close coupled flash / lens combo, and who really cares, as it is corrected with a click of the mouse before you print a photo. A few MAJOR improvements are the 9 zone Ai AF, and new (yellow) focus assist. If you were not careful, the 200 could return slightly out of focus shots, and in low light, the focus assist sometimes didn't. That has been fixed. The 9 zone intelligent AF really does an amazing job, and the new focus assist achieves lock under a much wider range of difficulty than the old system.The built in flash has a generous range for a tiny camera, and the coverage is very even. Shooting a blank wall within the range of the flash shows no \"hot spots\". The metering options are still program, center weighted, or spot, but the program mode seems to have been given a big boost. The 200 does very well, but the 400 is on par with the SLR class for getting it right the first time.Exposure bracketing is +/- 2 EV, slow synchro flash is still there to boost background brightness when needed, the panoramic stitch mode is still a treat, and, in general, this is nothing less than a James Bond version of a full featured, top quality 4+ megapixel digital camera. The only tradeoff is that a full sized camera with similar features might offer a larger lens aperture. That can extend your non flash low light level by an F stop or so, but it does no good if the camera is sitting at home, rather than in your pocket. If it is in your budget, get this camera. Not only will you take more quality pictures over time, but you won't be burdened by feeling like a conspicuous tourist while doing it.One last note. Buy a high speed (24x) 256 meg memory card. The speed alows for quicker second shots (the 400 can do 2.5 FPS in continuous mode), and the 256 meg size gives you a full 128 shots at the highest resolution, many hundreds of pics at the low res setting.", "Date": "March 25, 2003"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera, highly recommended over the Sony DSC-P10", "Author": "BobbyDigital", "ReviewID": "R3S43DZ9TI2ON2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought the S400 from Dell for $xxx a little while back and was considering the Sony DSC-P10 at the time as well.  I figured I'd write up a review on amazon to help other people out that are in the decision making process.Price:-----The Sony DSC-P10 is 5 MP vs. 4 MP for the S400.  The difference in resolution may immediately sway your decision to teh DSC-P10, but I would think very carefully. While the extra 1 MP sounds like a lot, my old 2.0 MP Canon S00 was fine for priting pictures all the way up to 8x10 (w/o any cropping). 4 MP resolution should allow you to price 11x14 with no cropping, and 8x10 with a lot of cropping.  5 MP is just excessive IMO. These days, it's just a race among manufacturers to see who can advertise the highest MP number.Shooting modes and menus---------------------------------P10 also has some convenient shooting modes which make it more user friendly.  It also has great features like cropping, resizing and rotating right on the camera which helps when you are not by a computer and want to free up room on your media storage.The Canon S400 has a far superior menu system and is much easier to use.Size:-----Canon S400 is smaller, making it a more pocketable camera IMO. Trust me on this one.  The specs shown them being only very slightly different in dimensions, but the total volume of the cameras makes the S400 ideal.  Those with bigger hands may prefer the layout and slightly larger size of the P10 though.Memory storage:---------------The P10 uses Memory cards, which are limited to 128 MB, unless you use the double sided ones (Sony Memory Duo), where you can flip them over to get another 128 MB. Far too much hassle for me.. sounds easy in theory, but in real life, you will hate it. My friend who bought the P10 surely does.  You can get larger memory sticks, which comes in the form of the \"Sony Memory Pro\", which are 256 MB and 512 MB.  Keep in mind though, that these cards have problems acting as regular storage for files, and things like Mp3s for sony mp3 players. They have some type of digital rights management (DRM) on them that have causes lots of problems for people (so i've read on many reviews).  Also, these PRO cards only work in 2003 (or newer) sony devices.  Lastly, the memory pro cards have some type of management files on the cards themselves, taking up about 20MB of space. So a 256 MB card, really only has about 230 MB.  Maybe not a big deal, but com'on, at advertise the size correctly!Battery Life:-------------Battery life on P10 is better than the S400. It will last about 20% longer.  However, the batteries are cheaper for the S400 AFAIK and they also charge in about 1/2 the time vs. the sony batteries.Conclusion:-----------All in all, i think the S400 is a better choice. Sure, CF maybe outdated in a few years in favor of smaller, superior storage media like SD, MMC or xD cards (which are going up to 1 GB btw), but until then you can get a great digicam with dirt cheap media. I picked up a 512 MB Kingston card for very cheap from eBay.Tips for those buying the S400:-------------------------------1. Ensure you buy good quality CF cards for the S400. CF cards have on-board processor on the cards themselves which actually regulate how fast the read+write is, unlike smartmedia which reliees on the camera.  This means that CF cards will differ greatly in speed for read+write performance.  Recommendations are Viking, RiData and Kingston. I have used about 7 or 8 different types of cards, and these are definitely the best in speed and reliability.  Viking can be found cheap on Amazon deals quite often (with rebates), and kingston and ridata can be found on eBay for cheap.2. Buy the legitimate Canon branded NB-1LH batteries. They can be had for about $30-$40 if you look hard enough. Stay away from NB-1L (notice the H is suffix is missing). The NB-1L is the lower capacity battery for these cameras.  Stay away from aftermarket batteries. Sure they sell for MUCH cheaper (often 1/3 the price), but reliability and longevity of these are just brutal. There are always exceptions to the rules -- some ppl have have great experiences, which others have dead batteries almost right away.  Why risk having a dead battery while you are on vacation and miss those Crucial shots of your wife/gf?  Spend the extra $15 and get the real-deal batteries.Recommended purchase:----------------------Canon S400-256 or 512 MB Viking, RiData or Kingston CF card-1 extra battery NB-1LH-Camera Case PSC-100 -- padded case with front storage for extra battery and storage.

J&R; sells non-Canon brands for as low as $...4) Tripod mounting now on far left side of camera (you are looking at the back of the camera5) Minimal Accessories available for the cameraMy Opinion:...I brought 3 different camera with me. The S230, S45, and the S400 up to Boston while I do a bit of sightseeing between interviews. The reasons why I brought 3 of my camera was to see which camera will have the higest quality of picture.I took photos of the Cambridge area, the Northern docks, and of Fenway with all three cameras... and of close up and group photos with my friends in the area. The fastest camera to start up was the S400. In fairly close up photos and group photos in daylight or good lighting situations, there wasn't a discernable amount of difference between the three cameras especially after printing out the photos on a photo-quality inkjet printer. I noted differences in distance shooting (landscaping photos) and low light situations. Landscape shots of the Boston Harbor captured better details especially with objects in the far background with the S400 and S45. Distant shots of Fenway captured sharper details on the S400 and S45 as well. Nighttime shots were best captured on the S45... although not by a great deal over the S230 and S400. The range of manual controls were without a doubt better on the S45 and that allowed me to take better twilight landscape photos than the other two digital cameras. The surprise was that the S400 seemed the fastest to display the picture in the LCD after the shutter button is pressed and the continuous shot modes were also considerable faster to me than the S230 and S45.", "Date": "April 13, 2003"}, {"Title": "Fast 4 megapixel wonder!", "Author": "Technology Nut \"Radical\"", "ReviewID": "R1QWTGBTJJ4UY6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After extensive research on the web ...I chose to upgrade my Canon S20 to a Canon S400.  In someways, this was a step down.  Unfortunately, the S400 does not support verticle alignment of it's panoramic \"stitch assist\" mode as they do on the S40, S45, S50 and other higher priced models.  I found this feature on the S20 to be very useful in capturing more image (greater resolution and consistant panning) when stitching photos together to make a panoramic photo.  Also, the S400 does not support the higher resolution movie mode of 640 x 320, as some digital cameras support.  Hopefully, Canon will address these feature shortfalls with a firmware upgrade in the near future.  As mentioned in a number of reviews, the S400's flash is miniscule and thus is somewhat inadequate to light wide distant shots.Canon has improved the intelligence of the powershot digital line.  Specifically in the S400 the Digic processing makes for fast picture taking and viewing.  The size of the S400 is grand.  It does fit in a pocket and powers up so quickly, you may never miss another shot with this camera (keeping in mind to charge your battery and have enough flash memory for the moment!!!).The bottom line... the Canon S400 is compact, sturdy, and fast.  If you are looking for a very small 4 megapixel camera with nice even colors, low levels of distortion, a basic movie capture mode, fast memory writing and reading, the S400 is a current top pick.  However, if you are looking for lots of manual control, vertical \"photo stitching,\" and more pixels try the S50.One note if considering the S45 or S50 cameras, play with the navigation buttons before purchasing the unit;  I have found the navigation to be somewhat clumsy in-which it is easy to hit \"enter\" when trying to navigate \"up\" or \"down,\" or hit \"up\" when trying to \"enter.\"", "Date": "June 12, 2003"}, {"Title": "Perfect for casual photo enthusiasts (travelers)", "Author": "NutMac \"NutMac\"", "ReviewID": "R3CD69B7TT2V1W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a casual photo enthusiast who enjoys taking pictures of my friends and family wherever I go. Both photographic quality and portability are of paramount concerns and I think I found my holy grail with Canon S400.Pros:- Extremely portable, yet very rugged- Beautiful design with excellent overall ergonomics- Typically excellent photo quality in all-auto mode with no redeye- Very fast -- startup time, image processing and acquisition, menu response- Long battery life- Uses widely popular (and inexpensive) CompactFlash Type 1 memory cards- 4 megapixel resolution (2272x1704)- 3X optical zoom/11X max with digital- Useful movie mode with audio (3 minutes at 320x240 or 160x120)Cons:- Minimal manual controls (e.g., no manual focus)- Cheap A/V/digital output cover- Movie mode limited to 3 minutes (and no 640x480 mode may irk some)- Proprietary battery- Some barrel distortion when taking wide angle shotsWhile S400 has some shortcomings, mainly lack of manual focus, exposure, and shutter speed. And some may be bothered by its use of proprietary lithium ion battery, although given its compact size, I think Canon engineers had to implement proprietary battery. On the plus side, the battery lasts a long time, capable of taking several hundred shots before running out of juice (and takes only a couple of hours to recharge).I've managed to fill entire 512MB memory card (32MB is included) on a single battery charge.Did I mention how beautiful this camera is? The photos do not do this camera a justice. At 3.4\" by 2.2\" by 1.1\", the S400 is no larger than most compact cell phones. Inch by inch, it's only a tad larger than my tiny Sony Ericsson T68i cell phone and smaller than (although a bit thicker) my Apple iPod MP3 player.The ergonomics are consistently excellent. Although there are some learning curves (particularly given rich feature set), once mastered (comprehensive manuals make it easy), most will appreciate elegant menu layout and ideal number of buttons and layout.But beautiful design means nothing if it does not accomplish its main functions -- taking beautiful pictures. In full auto setting, which is what majority people might use, the pictures were consistently satisfying, although overriding the white balance to match the lighting condition improved the quality significantly in many shots.This is a great camera.", "Date": "April 15, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great camera in a tiny size-even better than higher model", "Author": "T. Tom", "ReviewID": "RRYD62GLM0Q1U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this little digital camera. It does everything a point and shoot digital camera should do and more. For me, a point and shoot camera should be small and light so that it can conveniently go with me everywhere. That's the power of any point and shoot camera actually. It goes with you in your daily life and subsequently you get shots that you could not get with other larger cameras either because it would be too conspicous, or too inconvient to carry with you.The S400 camera is barely larger or heavier than a pak of cigarettes and even fits in a shirt pocket with relative ease.I originally had an S50 but ended up getting rid of it because it was too big and heavy and the manual controls on it were cumbersome to use. In the end, the manual controls on the S50 were not worth having to carry around such a brick-like camera.  The S50 often ended up staying at home or in the car and I missed out on shots because I did not have the camera with me.The images out of the S400 suprisingly enough, look even better to me than those out of the S50. I can't really explain why this is considering that the S50 is a full 1 megapixel higher than the S400.I don't miss having the full manual controls that the S50 has at all. When I had the S50, I found that I hardly ever used the manual controls anyway because they are a bit cumbersome. I actually longed for more ease and simpleness, which frees one up to take pictures more spontaneously.  So the small size and convenience of the S400 more than outweighs the lack of full manual controls for me.  And the S400 does have manual mode where you can dial in some settings manually, just not f-stop and shutter speed. Further, you can often achieve the same effects as if you had full manual controls just by knowing how to set the S400. For example, if I want to shoot an outdoor portrait with a shallow depth of field (so the background will be blurry), I would set the camera's ISO to 50 and then meter off of something fairly dark (like the shade) while holding down the shutter down halfway to lock the exposure and recompose to the subject to take the picture.To conclude, I am happy with this camera because it does everything a small point and shoot digital camera should do, yet it is quite small, light, feels sturdy (metal case) and has very pleasant ergonomics both with regard to the layout of the controls as well as to the on screen menu functions.", "Date": "June 9, 2003"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware! Temperature Changes May Kill This Camera!", "Author": "\"tilbertwag\"", "ReviewID": "R2UMKPDRQ85XNJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought an S400 seven months ago and was very happy with it. Recently, however, it stopped working without warning. When I sent it in to the factory service center, I discovered something very troubling about the camera that had I known earlier would have caused me to not purchase it.It turns out that this model--as well as many other Canon digital cameras, the tech told me--has an aluminum body. If you subject the camera to temperature changes (and it only takes a change of 10-15 degrees, I was told) condensation will form inside the camera, and the camera will start to corrode, eventually rendering it unusable.This is what had happened to me. What misuse had I subjected my camera to that caused this to happen? I took it on vacation to the beach with me. Carrying it from the hot and humid beach into an air conditioned car was enough to destroy the camera!The tech told me that he sees this all the time. He didn't know the percent of all Canon cameras that suffer this fate, but he said a lot of them do. He told me he gets lots of cameras back from people who have taken them on vacation to Arizona, Mexico, and Hawaii. He even saw one that had stopped working because the owner kept it stored in a stuffy closet. When the owner eventually took it out to use it, the temperature change back to normal room temperature was enough to fry the camera.I was told that this damage is not covered under warranty and that the manual cautions users not to subject their cameras to this sort of treatment. Canon will not provide service on cameras that suffer this fate.I hope anyone interested in purchasing a Canon digital camera will learn from my very expensive mistake in purchasing this model.The camera is very nicely designed, but it's poorly engineered. If you plan to use the camera indoors only this is a great model. But if you plan to use the camera both outdoors and indoors, if there is a difference in humidity and temperature between the two where you live, and if you don't want to run the risk of totally losing your investment in the camera, this isn't the model or brand for you.", "Date": "May 7, 2004"}, {"Title": "Wonderful little camera", "Author": "V.

I was looking for a smaller camera that would be easier to carry. After much research I chose this Canon S400, and it's just about perfect. The display is clear and easy to use. The included rechargeable battery and charger are easy to use, very small, and the battery charges fairly quickly after the initial charge. I took it with on a trip to DisneyWorld, where I took about 50 pictures daily. It fit nicely into a small pocket of my waistbag. I purchased with it two 256MB Sandisk CF cards, they have worked flawlessly thus far. Hooking the camera up to my iMac was no problem, I hooked up the included USB cable and iPhoto instantly recognized the camera; the pictures were uploaded in no time.

I bought the Canon S230 (3.2mp) in January and have already upgraded to the S400. This camera has been in stock for several weeks at online stores I probably can't mention here. I've had mine for a week now. Overall this is a great camera, it's the same size as the S230, very carryable, high quality, improved optics and zoom (3x optical instead of 2x) and the extra megapixels come in handy. There are a few minor points to pick at.1). Certain parts of the camera are now plastic instead of metal as on the S230 (from what I can tell, the zoom ring around the power button, the chrome ring around the lens, and the edges of the lens). The main body of the camera is still metal, however it's a new finish (Cerabrite) which has an odd plasticky look to it. Overall the construction quality doesn't feel quite as nice as the S230, notably the feel of the buttons when pressed, however it's nothing to be alarmed about.2). For some reason Canon removed the 640x480 movie mode option. I never used the movie mode extensively, but this might matter to some users.3). While some people might like it, (I think it's tacky) Canon has added the following useless features: Camera startup sound, shutter sound, camera display theme and startup image. There are cheesy sounds like a bird chirp, or a wolf howl, startup images like a Canon logo, picture of sunset, bird, etc. Due to the addition of these features the camera now has a tiny speaker. One benefit of the speaker/sounds is that Canon has added a self-timer sound which I think is useful.Some other nice additions/changes include the ability to edit the length of movie clips on the camera, a closer focusing distance in the macro setting, and the ablility to record a sound bye of up to 60 seconds to a picture (also useable as a simple voice recorder for recording memos, thoughts, etc) which will play back via the tiny speaker. The microphone has been moved from the front of the camera to the top, this could be good or bad depending, it may record less wind noise in windy situations (especially if facing into the wind), however it may also no longer pick up quieter sounds due to the repositioning.At a minimum I would reccommend the use of a 128mb card, preferrably 256mb or larger. At less than $$$ I would suggest an external memory card reader to be used for transfering photos instead of the Canon software which seems buggy at times. As far an extra battery goes, some people won't live without an extra. With the price of the battery, I'd pass. Canon says the camera is good for 190 photos with the LCD on (400+ with LCD off). I've never taken more than 50 pictures in a day and have always had an opportunity to recharge the battery during some down time in the evening.To sum things up, if you're looking for a high quality high megapixel camera that's easily carryable, and hardly noticed in most pockets, this is it!. The combination of size, quality and features of this camera are unmatched!. If you don't require 4 megapixels or want to save $$$ I'd highly reccommend the S230 which I have also reviewed.", "Date": "March 26, 2003"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT CAMERA", "Author": "C.

I wanted the camera to be small, so I narrowed the choice down to the Canon S400 and the Pentax Optio S.  I ordered both (from companies that offered no-penalty returns) and reviewed them for several days.  After side-by-side testing, I'm going with the S400.  Here's why:1) Controls: the controls on the Canon are better and require less digging into internal menus to do what you want to do.  Very important to me.  The Pentax has some but not as many external options--you have to dig more.  Some examples: Movie mode, panoramic mode.  Also, the little Pentax 4-way-plus-\"okay\" (center push) joystick is pretty small, and although the average user can learn to use it quickly, it is still not desirable.2) Screen quality: Much better on the Canon--brighter, sharper, etc.  Pentax screen is a bit darker and slightly pixely.3) Focus/shooting: With the Pentax, when you press the button to focus, it freezes the frame for a second, where as the Canon doesn't freeze the frame--it allows you to see your subject at all times.  This was slightly annoying at first but became unbearable when I attempted to snap pics of my 1-year old daughter who was crawling!  Also, the Pentax takes longer to focus for most shots.4) Movie mode: Canon's higher quality mode was much better--a sharper, cleaner, brighter movie.  Sound quality is a little better, but not lots.5) Battery door: The Pentax's door is super cheesy, just like all the reviews say, although this is not a major concern for me.6) Overall construction: I think this Canon will take a bit of a beating--the Pentax feels a bit [weak] in comparison.7) Battery charger: This is a small item, but I like the fact that the Canon charger is a little unit with a plug on it--so you don't need any extra cords to plug it in--it just plugs straight into the wall.8) Picture quality: Canon's 9-point focusing system works really well.  The pictures are clean and crisp.  The Pentax takes a bit long to focus at times, and I got a few blurry pics--sometimes it focuses on the wrong thing.  I didn't notice a major difference with the quality between the 3.2 MP and 4.0 MP, but I'm sure if I blew up an 8x12 bigger I'd notice the difference.9) Panorama: I think Canon does the Panorama thing slightly better, although the Pentax does it well, too.Here's what's better about the Pentax:1) Size--super small and light.  Absolutely amazing.  Although, to be fair to Canon, the S400 is virtually the same size as the S200, which is impressive.2) Great battery life.  Can't say it is much better than Canon's, but it is good.3) Super short lag time between photos in review mode (and slightly longer but still short in photo mode)--slightly shorter than Canon's, but I can handle that.4) Colors seem more natural.  In the automatic mode with the Canon, the colors are a bit too bright, almost unreal, BUT you can use the manual mode with the Canon and choose a \"neutral\" setting to deal with the color issue.5) The Pentax has slightly more manual control, like manual focus, for instance.In summary: If you want super small, go with the Pentax.  If you want solid and super high, durable quality, go with the Canon.  The Canon runs about $$$ more (you can find it for less, though), but I think it is worth it.

The first was a 1.2 MP Olympus that was just way too big to carry around. I chose the Canon based on three factors: Size, Image Quality, and Ease of Use.Size-- Size was my biggest concern. It's so tiny!! :) The camera is about the same size as a deck of playing cards. Nevertheless, the LCD screen is of a usable size and the buttons aren't so tiny that you need to use a fingernail to depress them. The viewfinder is a bit small, but atypically, shows a fairly true representation of what your shot will look like. I found the LCD screen to be a much better way of taking pictures.Image Quality-- Wow! I was so pleased! None of my images have needed major color correction. The white balance is right on track. This little camera gets it right even in difficult color situations like bright sunlight. Flesh tones come out nice and natural and whatever Canon has done to eliminate red eye really works. I'd highly recommend this camera to people picky about image quality.  The camera allows you to set the resolution of your photo. I've taken most of mine on \"fine\", but there's also a \"superfine\" resolution. I find that on the superfine, I get 14 shots. I average about 27 on fine. This brings me to my only issue with this camera-- What's up with the 32 MB card?? If you're spending this amount of money on a camera, it ought to come with a bigger card. I went out and bought a 256 MB one almost instantly.Ease of Use-- Ease of use is the category that kept me from giving this camera five stars. It's very easy to learn the basic functions. Taking pictures, zooming in, zooming out, etc. The menus for the more complex functions are a bit less intuitive. They present you with useless options like changing the LCD's splash screen first and make you dig for important things like changing the resolution of the images.

That said, this is still probably the best consumer-grade digital camera on the market today.  Let me expound.First, 4-MP is the perfect resolution for day-to-day photography.  That is, if you are a pro photographer and need the best resolution, you probably want 5+ megapixels.  But for us normal mortals, 4MP is already more than enough.  You can crop your pictures and still make great 8\"x10\" blow-up prints.  A year ago I would have recommended a 3-MP camera, but right now you can get this 4-MP camera for cheaper than a 3-MP a year ago, so go for this one.Is more pixels always better?  Not necessarily.  More pixels mean bigger files as well as slower save speed, so it's best to strike a balance between resolution and speed, and 4 MP should be good enough.Second, the picture quality on this Canon is just excellent.  Earlier models of Canon (esp. the Digital Elph line) tended to underexpose and yield cold color tones, but the S400 does a very good job of keeping a natural, slightly warmer color range.  The pictures are still a little bit softer than sharp images captured by Nikon SLR's, but overall you'll be pleased by the picture quality, both indoors and outdoors.  The flash range could be longer, but the same can be said of all built-in flash units.The camera is easy to set up and use, and transfering pictures to Windows XP is a piece of cake.

If I was buying this camera today, I would also buy an extra CF card with at least 256MB of memory. This great camera is limited without it. Finally, while this camera takes amazing pics, it also produces amazing red-eye. Make sure your photo program has a red-eye reduction feature (and most do).

This probably has something to do with the autofocus assist lamp. Even in bright outdoor scenes, the Powershot seems to do a better job.2. Less noise in low light situation than the Minolta S404. None of the flash photos that I've taken with this camera have shown signficant color noise problems like what I saw in the Minolta.3. Very short time between frames.

Don't fool yourself into thinking that one of the medium sized cameras (Minolta S404, Canon G3/G4/G5) will give you all the control you loved about your old 35mm SLR camera. They don't come close. To make matters worse, they are also no more portable than a full-size SLR. So in one sense, they are the worst of both worlds: too bulky to fit in a pocket, but not geeky enough to make real photo geeks happy.

I wanted something small and reasonably priced, 4 megapixels, and with excellent image quality.  I got those in my S400 -- for 14 months.The warranty expires after one year, but at the 14 month mark my camera began showing the message \"Memory Card Error,\" no matter what card I put in it.  I couldn't take pictures, nor could I use the camera to upload the pics already on the card onto my computer.  Luckily I had another card reading device and was able to transfer the pictures I had taken before my \"Memory Card Error\" woes began.I contacted Canon, and they said I can either pay $150 to $300 to repair it, or upgrade to a S410 for $260.  I might consider that, but guess what?  I already got screwed on my digital videocam that way.  My Canon video camera worked for two years then started eating tapes.  There were dozens of online histories about the problem and the fact that Canon wouldn't do anything about it, and my case was no different.  Seeing as I'd paid $1200 for the camera, I decided to have it fixed.  $250 later, the videocamera is back but it's already having more techincal problems.  Thus, my lesson is learned -- don't go the repair route.  Not only that, but we have a Canon printer, which actually works, but they stopped producing drivers about 2 years after we bought it.  The only way to print was to run Win95 on our computer.  So I guess Canon may make the best products on the market -- and they consistently get top reviews -- but their products aren't meant to last any longer than the warranty period.One thing I would also like to add: if you decide to risk it and buy the S400, be aware that indoor pictures usually end up with a strong color cast.  This is fixable with Photoshop, but not very easy to compensate for with cheaper photo manipulation programs.  And of course there is lots of red eye (I suggest a free program called Shutterfly Express that does an excellent job removing red eye), but you're going to get that with any ultra compact camera.When all is said and done, I used to be a satisfied customer, but now I'm done with Canon.

As compatibility seems to affect speed of write/read to/from the card, I was a bit concerned about buying SimpleTech.  My 512MB SimpleTech card has so far no discernable difference in performance.  (Sadly, I was actually expecting an improvement from SanDisk CF card based on review at [...]) Amazon's product description doesn't say SimpleTech CF card is Type I or II.  It's Type I that fits with S400.CF card capacity:My S400 says 512MB card can hold 247 pictures at highest resolution and Superfine setting.  (Someone wrote life was too short to bother with settings for lower quality images.  I agree.)  Its manual says 256MB should hold 123 images, as you can imagine.  256MB may be good enough, depending on your usage pattern.CF card reader:I also purchased a CF (only) card reader from SimpleTech (UCF-100).  Windows 2000 says CF card has FAT format as storage media.  There shouldn't be compatibility issues with your PC, in theory.  The software that comes with S400 recognizes CF card reader as a camera.  CF card reader's package says it can transfer data up to 1.5MB per second.  This can roughly mean, for S400, a picture a second.  Actual speed feels slightly slower than that.  (I used my clock to measure time.  Can't be too accurate.)  However, it seems to be three to four times faster than transferring image data from S400 directly.  When you have a lot of pictures on S400 to transfer, this speed advantage can justify having a CF card reader.Leather case PSC-50:I feel S400 needs a case as a protection though I didn't feel a need for my 35 mm point and shoot cameras from Canon and Olympus in the past.  This may be from its relative weight.

I wanted a camera that produces high quality images, is very compact and easy to use.I have a Sony digital camcorder. Naturally, I was initially inclined to buy a Sony. Besides, Sony cameras (of the same price range) seem to have more features and more pixels than Canon cameras. But when I went to a store to check the cameras out, the Sony cameras reminded me of the (fairly new) Sony digital camcorder I have: the menu is so clumsy and illogical that sometimes it drives me nuts!In contrast, the Canon cameras struck me as extremely user friendly. Aside from the S400's size, metal body and its pleasing exterior, I couldn't believe how easy it was to navigate the controls. Everything is logically and intuitively laid out. For every menu choice one makes, the LCD screen displays the name of that function in addition to the icon. (One does not need to memorize what icon means what--one can read it on the LCD screen.)I chose the S400 above the other Canons, because I decided that the S400 offers just enough manual controls as a point-n-shoot camera. I figured that if I wanted full control, I'd buy a Sony DSC717; if I needed a camera for extreme high image quality, I'd use my Nikon SLR's. For most everyday use, including printing up to 8x11, 4mega pixels is more than sufficient.There are several things that I am disappointed with (aside from the 32mb memory and lack of a pouch):1. Flash pictures tend to be over exposed. Or else the picture is very dark. One can use the manual control to adjust the exposure compensation, but for spontaneous shots, that seems rather cumbersome.2. The red-eye reduction function doesn't seem to work very well on my set.3. When I installed the software on my  computer (Windows Me), the computer freezes at the end of the installation process.

I have NOT tried this out yet though.An alternative to installing software is the USB cf card reader (I bought one made by SimpleTech for $16) which plugs in to my Windows Me computer and is immediately recognized as an additional device. The downside to that is that one has to remove the cf card from the camera and insert it into the reader.

But, I have learned to work around it.Be sure to buy an extra storage card (256 MEG +), because you will want to take the highest quality photos you can.  If you need smaller ones, doctor them up later, but take at highest quality and size first.  Don't worry the camera is just as fast to take large photos, as it is small ones.  The small photos look great, but the highest quality ones are AMAZING!I can't think of a camera being any better, other than one that is smaller ... but I am being too ungrateful now, so I will stop.

However, my opinion changed drastically when it stopped working completely. We took it camping and left it in a car overnight to protect it from the elements, it was very cool, but in the morning it wouldn't power on. We sent it in for repairs under warranty and it was deemed 'beyond economic repair', meaning the cost of repairs were more than the cost of the camera. I thought this would result in a new camera, but no, it meant you're screwed! I talked to repair department supervisors, bumping it up until I was talking to the repair service head honcho who simply said \"sorry\". Apparently the manual warns you of this and tells you to put it in a plastic bag, yada yada yada. This was our first digital camera and we justified the cost because we would save so much on film development. Well if you have to pay $400 for a camera that only works for 4 months before you have to buy another one, I don't think it works out. By the way, I have a Canon EOS Elan SLR film camera that I've had for 8 years. I've taken it backpacking and have literally had it in waterfalls taking nature pictures, it's blown over on a tripod onto rock, it's bombproof, I swore by Canon, until now.

It is my second digital camera (my previous being a Nikon Coolpix 950, which I used for about 3 years).Strengths:  Size (obviously), battery life (I've never run out of juice in a single day), speed to turn on (about 3 seconds), ease of reviewing pics, minimovies (more fun than I'd anticipated), image quality (if lighting is adequate).Disappointments:  More shutter lag than I'd hoped for, lack of manual controls (I knew that going in, but I do miss the flexibility I had with my Nikon), blurry pics in even moderate light without a flash (don't know if the shape makes it difficult to hold steady or if it's just a slower lens), more image noise than I'd like in ISO selections beyond 100.I did have to send the camera back to Canon once -- I turned on the camera while there was light pressure on the lens and the whole thing became inoperable.  They returned the camera in less than 2 weeks, which I thought was reasonable.In summary, this has been a nice little camera.  You're definitely trading off some flexibility for the size (Canon's G-4 isn't much more money and their A-80 is priced comparably.)  I find the images to be quite good.  The flash renders accurate flesh tones, unlike my old Nikon.  The biggest single negative for me is the shutter lag.  To capture moments well, you really need to be prepared, with the shutter halfway depressed (to lock in the focus).For a very detailed review, check out dpreview.

Over time you will find the major contributing factor to good images is sheer volume. Simply put, the more shots you take the more likely you'll capture a good image.Sure, you can buy cameras that have more megapixels and more features. Unfortunately they come with more heft. Once you've shoved a camera in your pocket, you'll no longer want one hanging from your neck. You can buy smaller cameras. But for me, this one feels just right. It slips into a pocket with ease. It's easy to hold and shoot. And it's not so small it feels fussy and insubstantial when you're taking pictures; it's just big enough that it won't disappear. Judging by my first camera, which has been dropped and repeatedly sat upon (I'm telling you, it's small) and used so much the buttons are almost worn out, build quality is excellent.The quality of your exposures on full auto will amaze you. White balance has been significantly improved since my S100, and whether shooting indoors or out the camera reproduces skin tones very well. (90 percent of everything you're likely to shoot will have a person in it, and if they look funny, the image looks funny. Skin tone matters.) If you're careful (good light, tripod) you can print enlargements to 8x10. Whether you print your own on today's better printers (use photo paper) or send them off to Shutterfly or the equivalent, in most cases they'll pass for film, rivaling even your best point-and-shoot cameras.Don't forget that unlike film, when it comes to digital photos you get a second chance because you can retouch your digital photos on your computer. You can use the supplied software or whatever came with your computer or pop for Adobe Photoshop Elements and \"fix\" many common mistakes, like red-eye. You may also find that you'll like shooting high resolution images to make prints from, then use your photo editing software to reduce the image quality, and hence size, for easy emailing. Despite my best intentions, most of my images live on the computer and not in printed photo albums. At 72 dots per inch (computer screen resolution) they look fabulous. By contrast, paper prints are 300 dots per inch, and far less forgiving. It's also cheaper to email an image--no paper cost, no ink cost, no postage.Film is still better than digital for a lot of technical reasons. The non-technical reason is the pictures look better. Especially if you're making big 8x10, 11 1/2 x 14 prints. But if what you're really going to be doing is point and shoot, do yourself a favor. Hang a full gallon of milk around the back of your neck and just reread this. That pain and the image library I've amassed explain why my very nice, very expensive Nikon film SLR, with its very nice lenses and very spiffy flash have been sitting in a closet for the last two years. And why I wouldn't consider carrying a camera much larger than an tin of Altoids.Two final comments. One, after being inundated with my digital photos and then getting their hands on camera, my wife, sister-in-law, and mother-in-law all own digital Elfs.

I decided to wait a while because I figured prices would come down and quality would go up.  That seems to be the trend.  I had thought for a while that I was going to end up with either the Canon A70 or the new A80, but at the last minute, I ended up with this nice little point and shoot camera, because that's exactly what I was looking for.  I was trying to convince myself that I needed all the manual features that the A-series offers, with their ability to use different lenses, etc.  But when it came down to it, I didn't really need all of that, simply because I have an SLR camera as well.  The main reason to get the digital camera was plain and simple: convienence.  The amount of features this camera has is outstanding, and you can play around with it for hours.  Even though the movie mode produces pretty fuzzy video, it's probably a feature I will use A LOT!Three critisisms I need to mention though.  I was surprised with how blurry some of the normal pictures can be, especially when the flash comes on.  It seems that when you have the camera in auto mode, and it detects low light, the flash will automatically come one (unless you have turned it off).  When this happens, it takes a little longer to take the picture and any movement of the camera produces a not-so-great pic.  I'm sure I just need to get used to the camera and how it works in each lighting situation, but for a point and shoot camera, I was expecting a little better.Also, accessing how much memory your card has left is a little tricky.  I just came back from a 2 week trip to Sydney, Australia to visit my mom.  I was very excited to use my new toy down there.  The first 3 days down there we spent on the sailboat and watched the fireworks in the harbour for New Years.  It was quite the experience and needless to say, there were some amazing shots.  By the third day I had taken over 100 pics and some video and wanted to know how much memory I had used.  In order to do that, you need to access a screen that asks you if you want to format your disk.  It also shows you how much memory there is.  I hadn't fully read the manual yet, and didn't know what that meant, so I ended up hitting \"ok.\"  Well, this erases everything on your disk, even protected images.  So all of my pictures I had taken were gone!!!!  Seems like a very stupid place to access your memory information.One other trait that I've noticed too:  There seems to be somewhat of a fish-eye effect on some pictures.  Especially more up close pics of people.  But I've heard this is a common problem in little cameras, esp. digital camers.Overall though, I've been very impressed and happy with my purchase.  I've gotten a lot of complements on it, especially when you can zoom into pics you've taken.  Some flower pics look really amazing with how much you can zoom and crop.I got a 256MB card, and an extra battery.  Typically I went through a battery a day on my trip.  The 256MB card is more than I need, though I went through almost two of them on the trip (a friend lent me his 256 card as well).  The camera was set on the highest quality settings though, so that ate up a lot of space.  All in all I had about 250 pics and about 2 minutes of video.I haven't dealt with the software yet, but I've read it's pretty good.Other than some of the bad luck I had with it so far, this is a great little camera.

The basic controls were easy to figure out in seconds. Some day soon I will read the manual to learn the advanced controls. 3x zoom is very useful. No red-eye. Automatic exposure control works well. A picture of large room was well lit and all parts of the room were easy to see. No dark areas. Like most digital cameras, you have to hold the button down and wait for the shutter and flash to fire. This makes action shots difficult. Cycle time is better than my previous two digital cameras. The only real down side is the proprietary battery. In the past I have purchased and loaded AA or AAA batteries anywhere. Now I have to recharge or carry a spare battery.The bottom line is: I use a digital camera for convenience. I purchased a Canon Digital Elph because its size makes it easy to carry. Therefore, I am more likely to have it with me when I want to take a picture.

Now I don't know if I'd  recommend this to anyone else, but I just wrapped it  up in some toilet paper to absorb any moisture and  put it into a ZIPLOCK bag and placed the camera in my  front pocket of my ski pants.  Dangerous I know.  But  nothing broke.  Still works fine.-BATTERY LIFE:Now I don't have a spare battery, but the battery did  last a full week of taking about 100 pictures w/o  recharging at all while I was down in Dominican  Republic.  Granted I didn't scroll through the pictures  that I had taken to conserve battery life only b/c I  forgot to bring the charger with me.  I did have the  lcd on while I took my pictures.-PORTABLE:The camera is small enough to fit inside your pants  pocket and fits nicely in the inside part of your  sports jacket for those occasions that require  suit and tie.  I didn't want to carry my camera  in one of those small camera bags b/c then I would  either have to put it on a belt (which isnt' to my  taste) or it would be too bulky for the pocket.  So  I decided to just use a ZIPLOCK bag to keep the dirt  and water out, which worked out fine when I was  shoveling sand and rocks into the cement mixer.-PICTURE QUALITY:Overall the quality is good.  I've used the camera w/o  the flash several times to get the same light  contrasts that you would see in real life instead of  lighting up the object and having a darker  background (just my preference).  That normally works  out fine, but sometimes I have to lighten the picture  up a little after downloading the picture.  I've had  no problems w/using the flash in my pictures.CONS:-LCD:  This probably occurs w/ other cameras, but just as a  heads up, watch out for the plastic piece on the camera  wrist strap.  If positioned right (or rather not right),  the plastic piece can scratch up the lcd when stored in  the pocket or wherever you store it b/c it could rub  against the screen.-I'm sure there are other cons, but that's all that sticks out right now.-COMMENTS: I normally use the superfine, small picture mode so  that the file is small enough for my friends and  family who have hotmail accounts.  They can get  several pictures w/o completely filling up their  mailboxes.  Downloading to computer is quick and easy.  I haven't  upgraded to a larger memory card, but I would if I  was going to be taking several pictures and videos  before downloading, which I isn't a problem for me.  Videos is where it starts to eat up the memory.  Anyway, hopefully this review helped.

What I loved about the ELPH was its compact size.  It really is small enough to carry in your pocket.  Even better, I got some of the best photos I'd ever taken using the ELPH, mainly because I carried it with me much more often and as a result, ended up taking pictures I would have missed had the camera been sitting at home.For me, it was out of the question to sacrifice the small size when I made the move to a digital camera.  Fortunately, the PS400 is extremely compact and produces photos that are much better than the ELPH was capable of doing.A major advantage of a digital camera is being able to immediately see the picture that you have just taken.  This allows you to re-take the shot if someone closed their eyes, or if it's poorly composed, or the flash needs to be adjusted. The PS400 is set to display the image for a few seconds after you take the picture, but you can also switch the camera into view mode and look at it more carefully if you need to.Another big advantage of a digital camera is that you can edit the image after you have downloaded it to your PC.  This makes it possible for an amateur photographer to do what can only be done in a darkroom when you use film.  The download process itself is very fast and easy to do, whether you use the USB cable provided with the camera, or a Compact Flash card reader (which is quicker and will not deplete the camera's battery).  Once the image is on your PC, you can make all sorts of adjustments, using the provided software, or image editing software of your own choice.You may be thinking that you won't want to do much image editing, and it is true that the camera takes pictures that are ready to go without any editing.  However, you will probably find that you are taking a lot more pictures than you ever did with a film camera.  Unlike a film camera, where you take a full roll of pictures and then wait to see the results, you get immediate feedback with a digital camera.  If you like it, it stays on the Compact Flash card until you download it.  If you don't like it, you can delete it and take another one.  Having the ability to shoot large numbers of pictures at no added cost, and experimenting with lighting and composition allows you to improve as a photographer.  I would never have used an entire roll of film trying to get the best possible picture of one subject, but I have found myself re-shooting the same subject from a variety of angles and with different lighting with the PS400. It's fast, it's free, and you can get immediate feedback on what works and what doesn't.The camera can be connected to a TV monitor to allow showing pictures in a slide show.  I haven't used the video mode yet, which to me is a nice extra, but not something I had to have.I have been pleasantly surprised with the camera's performance in low-light situations, always an issue with point-and-shoot cameras.  I have had far fewer pictures with red-eye than I ever had with any other small point-and-shoot cameras. Even shots that were poorly exposed have been quickly fixed using the digital imaging software.The multi-zone focus system works extremely well and I have not yet had a picture that was out of focus.  The viewfinder tends to give a smaller image than you are actually shooting, so I generally use the LCD screen instead.  This can be problematic for outdoor shots, because the LCD screen is difficult to view in direct sunlight.  However, it has not been troublesome enough to detract from my enjoyment of using this camera.Despite its tiny size, the camera is easy to use, even for someone with large hands.  The buttons are actually more substantial than the controls on my ELPH, and the menu system is reasonably well-organized.I haven't had a battery run out on me yet, though I did buy an extra as back-up. The battery charges very quickly and the charging device is small and compact, with an AC plug that folds into the charger itself when not in use.  You can fit the camera, the charger, the PC cable, and the A/V cables, in a very small camera bag, and still have plenty of room for an extra battery, extra Compact Flash cards, and even the user's manual.The camera comes with a 32MB Compact Flash card, which is more generous than what Canon provided with previous PowerShot models, but still not large enough (it will give you about 15 or 16 images at the highest resolution and largest size).  Since each image is about 2MB, you need a card that is at least 256MB. You will also want a case for the camera, since it is not included.  I have found that Canon's PSC-50 case works well with the PS400.  It provides protection but does not make the camera too bulky to fit in your pocket.I know that some users have complained about the ArcSoft software that comes with the camera, but I have found it to be more intuitive to use than comparable editing software I've used in the past (including some of ArcSoft's previous products, which were not very good at all).  I feel that it strikes a reasonable balance between ease-of-use and a more robust set of features, and is well-suited to its target audience.  The Photo Record software that allows you to create photo albums is excellent.I love this camera.  It is changing the way that I take pictures, and what I do with them after I've taken them.

While the overall build quality of the S400 is slightly inferior to Canon's 3MP S230 camera... the bevy of features compensates for this.On the plus side is the 4 MegaPixel photo capture, 3x OPTICAL Zoom (which is way more important than what level of digital zoom it has), built-in speaker and microphone, 9 point AutoFocus system, improved user interface with the new FUNC button, DIGIC image processor which speeds up photo capture and improves photo quality, improved battery life over the older Canon digital ELPH even the S230 camera, up to 3 minutes of movie capture in various resolutions, and voice annotations on photos.  All of this in a camera that fits into your shirt pocket.  You also have a few manual settings if you desire with manual exposure control, white balance (with several preset values), some photo effects (sepia shots, B&W;, motion blur), and long shutter settings to name several user adjustable settings.On the minus side, battery life is somewhat short (150-170 in my use on a full charge), the flash is weak especially for low light and nighttime shots, you often will get red eye in your flash shots even with the red eye reduction (although it is greatly reduced), the off-center tripod hole makes it more difficult to have stitched photos, the limited manual controls versus other cameras in this price range, and the price of the camera.Overall, this a great compact digital camera best for vacationing and those who need an easy to carry camera with little operating hassle.

Versus the S330, the S400:- Has a stepping zoom (7 steps) instead of a continual zoom- Is much more sensitive to camera jitter (shake) in no-flash low-light photography. If you plan to do that sort of photography, you WILL need a tripod.  This is the most sensitive (to shake in no-flash low-light photography) digital I've used yet.  Conversely, if you do use a tripod, those no-flash pictures come out REALLY well for the same reasons of sensitivity.- Has a less-easily scratched exterior material- Has different (better) laid out controls.- Has greatly extended battery life (improved battery and lower power consumption both).- Has a more intuitive menu for controlling features in manual mode such as ISO, whitebalance, etc -- and the menu can be manipulated on the LCD while shooting (without having to switch to the menu and then back to shooting).- And of course, the S400 is 4MP vs 2MP for the S330.What I'd love to see in a future ELPH:- Support for higher-speed flash memory, such as CF2.  Some elphs now support SD memory, but it's easy to design a camera to use both CF1 (what the S400 uses) and CF2 both.- Manual aperture control.- Better compensation for jitter during no-flash photography.Otherwise, this camera is wonderful and hard to beat without spending a lot more money for a bulkier camera.

This happens to be the worlds smallest 4Megapixel camera.  Its heavier than it looks, but its hardly noticeable in your pocket.  I purchased a little camera pouch with a shoulder strap that makes the camera vanish behind your arm.  The camera seems very delicate, so I get worried when others handle it.  The LCD screen doesnt come with any protection so you have to be carefull not to scratch it.  The s400 has plenty of features like movie mode up to 3 minutes.  It also takes great panoramic shots.  As a matter of fact, it is possible (and easy) to take 360 degrees of pictures and stitch them together with the bundled software.  There are many features for advanced users, but it is easitly figured out by the thickest consumers.  The buttons, however, are small so they may pose a difficulty for folk with large hands or clumsy fingers.  the 3x optical zoom is great.  The 11x digital zoom is harldy used but handy.  The various flash options, focusing options, and ISO speeds can confuse people.  Im still learning how to take the best pictures depending on the light source.  Of course, there is always the Automatic option if you want the camera to decide for you.  Overall, it may be a bit pricey after you purchase a decent CF card.  The 32 MB card that comes with it is harldy enough room for the size of the pictures the 2400 can take when the resolution and quality are maxed out.  Go buy a 256MB card.  The cards can be developed at a walgreens or the data can be moved to the computer and then to a CD.  The CDs can be taken to be developed as well.

The S100 was a prime example of how more megapixels does not equal better quality photos.  I took some panoramas while skiing in Banff.  One I blew up to 11x14 and it's simply breathtaking, always commented on by people who see it in my apartment.  And that was with a 2MP camera.  The S400 is similar to its predecessors, except for the higher resolution and 9 point autofocus & DIGIC processor.For well-lit situations, this camera simply can't be beat.  You can also use the photo-stitch feature to take huge panoramas.  Enough can't be said about the fact that this camera is truly portable.  It's only a little more obtrusive than a cell phone sitting in your pocket, and it's right there for you if you ever need to capture a moment, either with a still shot or video (which is surprisingly high quality).  The battery is great - easily lasts a day of shooting photos - just recharge overnight and you're good to go.  It uses CF cards, which can be had dirt cheap these days, and work with almost any adaptor.  (This comes in handy if, say, you run out of room while on vacation and need to download to a CD - most internet cafe's will have a CF-cardreader, while the same cannot be said of, say, a memory stick.)Drawbacks of this model are:(1) Slow response time between pressing the shutter button and taking the picture.  It's hard to capture those moments that require split-second response (baby smiling, etc.) unless you use continuous shooting.  To be fair, this is a drawback of nearly any consumer-level digital cam.(2) Poor performance in low light.  For some reason, pictures tend to get grainy when taken in low light.  This can often be made up for using photo editing software, and I've gotten big compliments on wedding photos I've taken in very dark settings.  However, the graininess comes out even in outdoor/cloudy situations.  A drawback.Some things I've figured out after using this camera for awhile:(1) You don't have to use the (included) TV adaptor to watch your photos on TV.  All you need is a stereo headphone jack to RCA cable adaptor, available at any Radio Shack.  Using this solution allows you to show/browse your photos on TV while sitting farther away.  Video goes to the red/right channel, audio goes to the white/left channel.(2) Battery charges very quickly.(3) Included photo software is the best of any I've seen yet at getting out red-eye.  On Macs, is OSX-native.  Pics are easily imported into iPhoto.  Use GraphicConverter for manipulating contrast/brightness/quality/etc.All in all, this is a great camera.

It's a great camera when it works, but Canon has no respect for it's consumers.

On my suggestion, after reading rave reviews on the S400, she bought one for herself too ($400 x 2).Since Jul/Aug '05, I am getting the E50 error message and the \"memory card error\" which means I can't take pics. I can't reformat the card with the camera, as the reformat function withint the S400 itself doesn't work, so I bought a multimedia card reader to format the CF card, and that worked for a while, but now the camera is at best unreliable for taking pictures.I Haven't gotten the E18 (zoom lens retraction) on my S400, which is another problem plaguing this and many other Canon cameras, but after doing some research, I wouldn't be surpised if that starts to show up too.I can't believe that after all the problems people are having with Canon cameras, all what seem to be common problems, (E18, E50, E51, \"memory card error\", etc.),that Canon takes such a position to charge for their lack of quality control.For all of the many Amazon users who have bought this camera and/or other Canon cameras with similar problems, there is law firm out of San Francisco, Girard Gibbs & De Bartolomeo, that is investigating consumer complaints regarding Canon PowerShot digital cameras.  Sorry, can't give you phone number, mail addresses or URLs  by Amazon review writing guideliens, so just do a search on any search engine and you will find the info.I think we should all sue Canon for knowingly selling products that are faulty. We should also report Canon to the BBB.  Sue, sue, sue!!!! They only seem to listen when you hit them in the pockets, don't ya think?Put a faulty product out there, and charge for the repair? Now that's a profitable business it seems to me, even if it's not morally correct. Imagine if auto makers did that? Canon knows their cameras have problems and they choose to ignore the consumers complaints.Do not buy this Camera - you will get the MEMORY CARD ERROR eventually and Canon won't help you fix it, but they will gladly charge you for fixing it.

The S400 has a great macro mode, focus lock, auto exposure lock, long shutter mode... I really like the auto focus mode telling me where the camera focused. The Nikon chronically focused on the background instead of the subject even in portrait mode. Very frustrating. Also, the plastic case on the Nikon was not rugged enough. The Canon has a very solid case that does not flex. The battery life is great and I did by an extra battery for about $35. The Nikon battery life was much worse. The shutter delay and startup delay on the Canon is very short compared to the Nikon. Canon starts up in about 2 seconds vs. the Nikon which is over 8. The Canon also switches very fast between shoot and review mode. Also, the slide show through the video output is much faster than the Nikon.

I am a Mac user myself and downloading my pictures is a snap.  When I'm not around my computer, but one of my buddies is on his PC - zip, bam, boom, he's got pics just as easy.  The video isn't super 8, but it IS a whole lot better than I expected from a digital camera not much bigger than a deck of cards, and three minutes (with audio) goes a really long way!The extras are nice.

The zoom browser is nothing short of awesome.  It helps you D/L your pictures fast and easily and will also erase your camera's flash card for you so you can start fresh (out here it's hard to find new ones).  It also contains a program called \"photo stitch\" that pieces pictures together for you to create a panoramic picture.All in all I've got to say this camera is incredible.

I can get about a full day of heavy picture taking with one battery.  Ive gotten over 500 pictures taken with it on one battery, though sometimes i get much less. My premium memory card i bought ive noticed has greatly increased the battery length. Since there is no power-remaining display, it is hard to judge how much power you have left until it's too late.  Two batteries I find works great.  They charge rather quick.The 32MB card that comes with the camera is fine if you dont mind taking lower resoultion pictures with it, but I liked taking pictures at the max settings; I filled up that 32mb card in a few minutes you might guess.  So, I went out and bought a premium 1GB flash card.  I can usually fill it up with about 400 pictures just before the battery dies.The picture quality is great. In light the automatic settings are fine.  In the dark though, unless you use the flash, you will need to learn how to set the manual ISO and exposure settings because the automatic settings (flashless) arent so great in the dark as motions get really blurred.  A long exposure set in the dark also makes things become rather 'grainy', it still takes a rather nice picture.The camera it self is rather heavy for its size i find, but it is a really sturdy design.  Ive dropped it on concrete many of times with only a slight scratch.  AS you can tell i abuse this camera pretty heavily, but it still keeps on working.  The trigger button recently has started to get stuck a bit sometimes when pushed, but i think that is due to my abuse of it.the movie clip mode is pretty simple.  It only can take 3min clips with sound, 3 mins is okay though i wish it was unlimited.  The video quality is ok, but you cant zoom or get it to auto-adjust the exposure while recording.  THe sound recording quality could be improved, especially with being able to pick up heavy bass.  Heavy bass just seems to saturate the sound recording with a loud rumbling garble.  What im trying to say is that you cant use this to record sounds when you're at the movies or at a concert.This camera has a lot more to it then that, but everything else about this camera just seems to be just the way i want it.

Butterfield", "ReviewID": "R3FNHMIYQ65JP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little Canon is ideal for somebody who likes to let the camera do the work most of the time, but occasionally likes to be a little more creative.It does a great job left to its own devices, with clever metering and focusing. The manual functions don't stretch to full manual control of aperture and shutter control (aperture priority would've been nice, to avoid - light permitting - the extreme differential focus effect you tend to get on close-ups,), but you do get control over metering modes, focussing modes, ISO, EV and various flash modes, as well as a `long shutter' mode that lets you det up to a 15 second exposure and invokes an excellent noise reduction system.I very much like the way you can adjust most of these directly from a button. It encourages you to be creative. Even when you do have to delve into a menu, it only takes a second. Canon's control system is one of the simplest I've seen, and I've had and used many digital cameras. This is a delight to use.It's nice to hold too, and has a big fat shutter button that you can't miss, even with big fingers. It reacts almost instantly if you pre-focus.The display is not the biggest around, but it's fast and clear, and even fairly usable in sunlight. All the indicators are clear and easy to see. The optical viewfinder is pretty good too, for such a small camera, despite the lack of parallax-correction marks.The zoom control is a little bit hit-and-miss though, and you find yourself going beyond the point you intended before it reacts properly.The pictures it takes are the most important thing though, and it's nice to see that the lens is up to the challenge of the 4.0 megapixel CCD. That high resolution is great because you can crop images quite a lot and still print them or view them at a  decent size. The images the Canon takes look at the same time crisp and natural, with little of that `processed' look I've seen from other digital cameras. If anything, the images start out a little flat, but a tweak of brightness and contrast brings them up to scratch. I'd rather this than get images that can't be tweaked in a photo editor without making them worse.Battery life seems quite good. The battery didn't last so long the first charge, but now keeps me going for a few days, even though I use the screen all the time and often review photos. There's no battery-level display until the battery gets low, which is slightly unnerving but doesn't really matter. A spare is a good idea.You can have fun with this camera too. By taking panoramas and stitching them together with the supplied software (works much better than I expected), or by setting the camera up to make different sounds for different functions. You can even record your own sounds using the camera's microphone. Once you start delving into all the things this camera can do, you wonder how on earth they pack it all inside.What don't I like? Well, to be honest, there's nothing worth mentioning other than the slightly clumsy zoom action. That's how good it is.

Instead, it figures out how to focus itself (and displays one or more green boxes in the LDC where it actually focused) and if it picks the wrong place(s), you have to release the button and try again.  Sometimes you just can't convince it to focus on what you want.  And ... of course, you need to realize all this is going on and pay attention or else you might end up with a bunch of duds.I still think this camera is probably one of the best quality small cameras you can buy.  We needed something to offset the bulk of the EOS 10D that we bought.  Once we tried that camera there was no looking back: you press the button, it takes the picture, no delay.  You HOLD the button and it takes 9 shots without stopping, 3.3 fps, 6 megapixels each.

Enough manual features to allow your creative side to experiement and keep it interesting. Personally though, I mostly plan to use the S400 in auto mode for most pics though, as the shots are unbelievable for such a small camera in all settings. My former camera was a Fujii FinePix 6800 which is also a fine piece of electrical engineering, however, I prefer the 4.0 megapixel CCD as oppose to an interpolated system delivering 6.0 resolution derived from 3.0. The S400 is also much smaller, and feels more solid in the hand. Another plus is the unit is great at battery conservation, unlike some systems that drain the juice forcing you to not use the LCD. A real neat feature worthy of mention is the \"Mini Movie\" with sound feature which allows for two resolution settings and 3 minutes of capture. The only drawback with this little guy is the rubber cover for the AV and USB ports which in time will probably need to be replaced due to wear. I wish Canon designed a door type device for this purpose, but then again, rough users would probably break the door off. For this enigma, I suggest a CF card reader, especially if you do not use the AV ports like me. I just upload the files, and convert them to whatever format needed to play in whatever device I want, and burn them on optical media of choice, so I can leave the cover in place. None the less this is a camera I highly recommend for all users. The set-up is basically brainless for computer geeks, and simple for newbies. The S400 itself in usage is similar, in that newbies will take great shots in auto mode, and when they progress they will find the manual settings fun to play with. One of the useful manual features is the \"Stitch Assist Mode\" combined with the easy to use included software, \"PhotoStitch\" anyone can shoot awesome panoramic shots. Another neat feature, although fairly benign, is the \"My Camera\" mode which you can alter audio effects to make the camera sound like it has a mechanical shutter. You can even create your own sounds and personal pics to upload with the supplied software to replace factory effects. Lots of stuff in this \"Little Guy\" to keep you amused. Plus it takes superb pictures!PS Digital cameras of this size are a real pain to find proper sized camera bags, so here are two that I purchased for different uses.  The first is a Tamrac Digital Series model #5690 that has a velcro strip along with a clip fastener in front for secure carrying. It also has a small zippered pouch in front that can hold a spare battery and two CF cards in their case.  The second is Lowepro model D-Res 8S with a zippered opening. This is a more fitted case which has an acessory pouch within the bag itself that can hold one spare battery, and one CF card. You could probably squeeze another CF card in, but the fit will be a little tight.  Both bags come with shoulder straps, belt straps, and are made of ballistic nylon that is well padded.  Your Elf will not roll or shake in these cases.

This is our third digital camera- one other Canon and one Nikon- and this was the best of the three. For the most part, I was satisfied with the images, but many required red-eye fixing or tweaking of the levels. Bright light pictures were usually very washed out.  Shot-to-shot and powering up times were good. I would give the camera a rating of 3.5 or maybe even 4 stars if it still actually worked.I started getting a message that said \"Memory Card Error\" after about 14 months.  The message only happened on occasion, and I could power it off and on a few times and eventually the camera would work.  It was annoying- for sure- but at least still (sort of) functional.  Two months later, there was nothing I could do to get rid of the error message and the camera became completely useless.  It made it to the ripe old age of 16 months!  I called Canon, and they said I could send the camera in to their repair shop, and they would mail me an estimate.  When I explained the problem, they said that it would most likely cost on the high end of $150 - $300.  Even the service rep. said that it would not be worth repairing.If your heart is set on buying this camera, please don't do so without buying an extended warranty.  You will most likely be VERY happy you did.  I had to use my warranty (purchased at Best Buy) on my previous Canon, and the customer service was outstanding.

I was concerned about the casing not being as durable as the ones on the S110, and wasn't sure why they went differently with the S400, but the brushed finish just makes it look that way. The rounded corners actually make it nicer to sit in your pocket. The flash is more powerful, just everything.

I would like to comment and perhaps help those who report slow shutter response -- the time between pressing down and when the image is captured.I will agree with folks who state there is a noticable delay if you start from \"hands off\" to \"full down\" on the shutter.  I missed several shots the first several attempts.  (My kids are young and are constantly in motion!)  There is a trick which I'm not sure is covered in the manual.By pressing down HALF WAY, the camera will adjust focus and balance settings without taking the picture.  Then, from the HALF-WAY down position, when you press down FULLY, the camera will take the photo IMMEDIATELY.Wait, there's more!  If you release the shutter only to the HALF-WAY point (some practice required) then press down FULLY again, the camera will take another picture at the same focus/lighting settings IMMEDIATELY.  If you keep releasing to the HALF-WAY point, you can take pictures in rapid succession.  If you completely release the shutter then the camera will go through the process of focus and lighting settings again.So now, when I want to take a picture, before the subject is ready, I press down HALF-WAY and wait for the moment, then CLICK -- Gotcha!  Release half-way, wait -- CLICK -- Gotcha again!

I tried the various focus options to try to work around this, but with little success.Other minor irritations: the camera frequently got quite warm, though not so hot as to constitute a burn hazard; the exterior finish scratches/wears off rapidly; it always starts up with the flash enabled (flash mode is not saved when camera is turned off).But after less than three months, it failed completely.  It would not even turn on.  So I sent it to Canon for repair.  They kept it for quite a while, before sending out a letter saying it would be repaired under warranty.  But then a short time later, they changed their mind, and declared that the camera had suffered extensive water damage and they would not repair it under warranty.  Naturally, since I had not exposed the camera to water, this was a surprise to me.  I also found it suspect that it took so long for them to discover that 'extensive water damage' was the problem and that about the only part of the camera that was still usable was the scratched up case.Bottom line: Canon wants $305 to repair a three month old camera that is supposedly under warranty.", "Date": "September 22, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good camera with one major shortcoming", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R24KTOX2Z0I6GE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a pretty decent camera.

Small enough to fit it your pocket, but not thin enough to break in your pocket when you sit down.  I've dropped it more times than I care to remember and it still takes great pictures.My only gripe about the camera is that it is FREAKIN' SLOW TO FOCUS.  I'm suprised that my finger has not gone through the body of the camera a few times in trying to get the darn thing to click.  But I say this about all digital cameras that I've used.  This probably depends on how much the battery is charged, but tell that to a 3-year-old who won't stand still or a whale that just jumped out of the water.By now, there are higher-resolution, faster cameras with bigger screens on the market, but I will stick with Canon when this one ultimately dies.  Their optics and electronics are excellent.Thank you so much schmalyn!  Every 2 or 3 years you will need to replace the internal battery to fix the \"memory card error\".  The battery is an Energizer 339 also known as a SR614SW 1.55 volts.  Call around to watch repair shops.  Radio Shack and Circuit City do not carry this battery.  I would recommend buying an extra one ($8 US) and keeping it with your camera stuff.  It would really ruin a vacation if you couldn't find a battery, although any photos that you had already taken should be safe on the card.Not only did changing the battery fix the \"memory card error\", but the function wheel (as I call it) now works too.  I had always assumed it was a physical problem.  The function wheel (with the manual overrides and movie functions) has not worked for 3 years -- maybe it never worked, but now it does.  The battery is an Energizer 339 also known as a SR614SW 1.55 volts.  Call around to watch repair shops.  Radio Shack and Circuit City do not carry this battery.A few comments, there are ELEVEN not nine screws, and I would suggest marking the body of the camera with a thin permanent marker BEFOREHAND.  The screws appear to be of different depths and thicknesses.  Have a big clear flat surface to work on.  As you take out the screws, line up the screws as you take them out.  When replacing the front casing, make sure to put the A/V Out rubber flap back in place.  Before replacing the back casing, make sure you line up the camera/play switch inside and out.I cannot be angry with Canon for the battery going dead, but I can be upset with them for not putting it in an externally accessible place.", "Date": "July 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Solid, Trusty Travelmate", "Author": "B. Ko", "ReviewID": "RVYM27XH5530W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my S400 in May 2003 and fit it with a 1GB Lexar CF card.  This camera has been with me across 3 continents -- from -10C up to 40C climates -- and easily 17,000 photos in these 3.5 years.The camera is very solidly built, and has a reassuring heft to it.  The Celabrite finish on the front resists fingerprints and is pretty durable (except in the corners where some of it has rubbed off from roughing it in pockets/purses).  The S400 has a 1/1.8\" CCD sensor, which is larger than most of the subcompact cameras out there -- they have 1/2.5\" sensors -- and translates directly into better low-light performance before noise-reduction and processing can even start to help out.  Because of this, my next camera will definitely have 1/1.8\", regardless of its noise-reduction capabilities.This was also one of the first cameras to sport an \"orientation\" sensor, meaning it \"knows\" which way you're holding the camera when you're taking the shot, and inserts this into the JPG's EXIF metadata.  But while normal images are named IMG_xxxx.JPG, the movie files are named MOV_xxxx.AVI, meaning in a normal listing view, they don't show up in chronological order interspliced with the images.  And I don't believe the movies have datestamps on them besides the file timestamp.  Anyway, for today's standards, the movie quality (resolution and frame rates) leaves something to be desired.The custom white balance on the S400 is quite good, and saved me from having to do a lot of postprocessing to \"un-yellow\" some photos.Focusing on this camera is a little slow, and is definitely audible.  But if you plan to take a lot of photos of the same subject (or at the same distance), you can lock the focus once you have it, and keep shooting without re-focusing.  This also shortens the shutter lag!  Ditto with exposure lock, which is useful if your picture has a wide range of lighting conditions and the best exposure isn't necessarily in the middle or detected by the camera.A second (and third, maybe) battery is a definite requirement if you go for day trips, because like all Canons, the S400 doesn't show how much battery power is left!  You get a flashing red battery sign, meaning you probably have 5-10 shots left; twice that if you turn off the LCD and flash.  I found that on vacation, I would go through two full batteries per day.  Sidenote: my second battery was an aftermarket with slightly higher capacity (900mAh over 840mAh), and it was 1/4 the price and lasted great until recently, when it stopped holding much of a charge.There have been, of course, many complaints about a famous \"memory card error\", but I haven't had it happen to me.

I do use the manual mode quite often to optimize for lighting conditions.  I also appreciate the easy ability to disable the flash with a separate button on the back as I frquenty turn off the flash for indoor pictures when there is plenty of light.

I recommend learning to download pictures on to a computer straight away and burn them on CD for long-term storage.Buy an extra battery.  There really is no warning when the battery is dying.  Once the warning hits, you will be lucky to get one more shot off.  I got burned on my one (and probably only) trip to Mt. Fuji in Japan and ran out of juice half way through the trip.

It only tells you a few seconds before it dies , and then, oops! Sony and the minolta both have battery warning, the Sony can even tell you how many minutes are remaining on your battery life if you get the DSCV1.

An optical zoom takes much crisper shots than a digital one and 3x enlargement is superior to the 2x in the S230 and other small digital cameras.

The S400 does not have the manual features of the S45. If you intend to do more fine arts work, then you should take that into consideration.

Amazingly, even as the features list has grown, the cameras themselves have gotten smaller. As always, the body is a sturdy steel structure that is durable but not too heavy.The 4 megapixel resolution is more than adequate for anything you can imagine, including shooting images for poster-sized enlargement. In fact, for anything routine, including keeping your options open for 8\" x 10\" enlargements, you'll probably want to dial the resolution down to 2 megapixels (this will make your digital files smaller and easier to transfer and will take up less space on the camera's memory card and will ultimately use less of the camera's battery capacity). There is a nice 3X optical zoom, as well as a less useful digital zoom. The movie feature has been enhanced, with 3 minutes of good quality video *with* sound now available.Of drawbacks there are a few. As with all of these digicams, the included memory card is too small to be of much use, so you are forced into an extra purchase right off the bat. The Canon battery, while offering pretty good staying power, is nonetheless a proprietary one, meaning you won't be able to get a back up from anyone but Canon. Lastly, it is a bit late in the game to still be using a USB 1.1 transfer protocol. Were the camera USB 2.0 ready, images could be transferred from the camera directly to your computer 40 times faster.

My first stop was Fuji, since the quality of images produced by my MX-1700 is excellent, and the camera is extremely durable and easy to use, not to mention that it looks very cool and is ergonomically well designed.  But, the latest Fuji products are simply too expensive.  So, I then toyed with a variety of cameras including the Canon G5, Nikon 5400, Olympus C5050/5060 and a whole host of others.  In the end, I went for small with reasonable power.Now, I'm glad that I did!The first thing that I noticed, right out of the box, is how well put together the S400 is.  It exudes quality.  It looks great and it feels solid.  Everything is small, which means that people with larger hands may find it a little 'fiddly' (I would recommend that anybody who is thinking of buying an S400 should first go to a local store, and actually handle one), but everything is neatly laid out.  The camera makes good use of what space is available, and most everything is reasonably logical and intuitive.Now that I have had the camera for a few weeks, I can also state that the quality of the images is also very good.  I have taken a few hundred shots, and the only complaint that I have, is some (minor) vignetting when at full wide angle using the flash.  The battery life is good and I have taken considerably greater than 200 shots with the display turned off and at least 150 with the display on.One of my major concerns when purchasing the camera was the flash.  Several of the reviews that I read had stated that the flash was \"puny\", so I was nervous when I first used it.  But, I'm not sure what kind of camera those reviewers were comparing the S400 too.  The flash is perfectly acceptable.  Sure, it's not a Vivitar Pro flash than can shoot 60ft, but it's just as good as any other flash on any other point-and-shoot camera.  I was pleasantly surprised.In just a few short weeks, the S400 has taken a place in my heart.  I still have my MX-1700, which is now being handed down to my 7-year-old daughter, but the S400 is the camera that travels everywhere with me.  I got a Lowepro DS8 case, which fits it like a glove, and is ideal for day-to-day carrying.As a final point, I should say that I have played a little with the movie capture mode of the S400, and was very pleasantly surprised.  I thought that it was nothing more than a gimmick.  But, I took a few minutes of video of my daughters, downloaded it to my PowerBook and then uploaded into iMovie.  It actually looks reasonable!  Obviously, it's not really of DVD quality, but if something was happening in front of you that you absolutely HAD to get on record, it's good enough.So, provided you are looking for a small, easy to use, reasonable image-quality, ergonomically pleasing point-and-shoot camera, then the S400 is excellent.  If you want something a little more `professional', get a Nikon D70 - they are REALLY nice.", "Date": "March 24, 2004"}, {"Title": "Fantastic - not much else to add to what's already been said", "Author": "Eric A.

It works just as the specifications provided says it should, and the quality of my pictures is outstanding.  The unit is compact and solid in my hand, and all functions are easy to use and adjust quickly after only a small amount of practice.  There are many different shooting options and you can manually adjust many exposure settings.Most of the photos I've taken so far have a very \"snapshot\"-ish quality to them--nothing very impressive, artistically speaking.  The flash washes out colors up close (like flashes do) and shooting in low light is difficult if you don't have a steady surface to rest the camera; however, when the settings are properly adjusted to the environment, you can get some amazing pictures.  Sometimes I'll come across a shot and say, \"Holy cow! Did *I* take this? It's beautiful!\"My only real gripe with this camera is that it didn't come with any helpful extras.  One battery, charger and 32MB memory card--that's it.  It would have been nice if they at least included a little cloth bag to keep it in until you purchase a case for it--and yes, you WILL want a case for this camera.  The 32MB compactflash card is good for starters, but it will fill up very quickly, and unless you're not going to use the video capture and you're willing to constantly do on-the-fly image selection--i.e. deleting pictures directly from the camera before you download them to your computer in order to make room for more (this is not difficult, but a nusiance when you would rather take pictures)--you will definitely want an upgrade.  Not much can be said for the proprietary battery except that it lasts about as long as you would expect it to.  A second battery is a must if you're out taking pictures all day long.  The charger is conveniently cord-free and plugs directly into the wall.  You can easily grab the whole unit and stuff it in a small bag with your camera for travelling.And to the reviewer who complained that the flash mode isn't saved when you power-down: True, if you leave your camera in the normal, automatic mode, the flash will default to \"on\" every time you power-up your camera--but if you use the \"manual\" mode, it will remember the flash setting, even when you take out the battery.  I usually shoot in the manual mode, then when I need to take a really quick picture and I'm just not sure about the settings, I flip over to automatic and point and shoot.I recommend this camera, but be aware that you'll probably want to spend at least another $50 - $100 on the following accessories right away:Small case - I found one locally that fit the whole kit perfectly for less than $10Spare battery - Use the genuine Canon part--people have reported problems with 3rd party batteriesLarge CF memory card - 256MB seems to be the gold standard, but don't forget that write/access speed is almost as important as size", "Date": "March 8, 2004"}, {"Title": "Best camera I have ever owned", "Author": "Ron Sims", "ReviewID": "R168CBPPYUCC83", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about 2 months ago to take to Afghanistan on my year long deployment.

Although the Casio Exilim is thinner, I was not entirely happy with the quality of the pictures taken with it. I guess it's because Casio is a relatively newer entrant into this market.The ability to just Point and Shoot is a must for me. Despite shooting a lot of photographs (I have small kids), I have no pretensions about being a master photographer. For me, this camera more than does the job. On full auto mode, I know that almost all the shots I take will turn out okay. As with most Digital cameras, the LCD enables you to see what your printed photo will look like.I have used cheaper digital cameras before (a 3MP MDC3000) and did not get the quality of photos I get now with the Canon. For one thing, the flash intensity seems to be controlled somehow so I rarely get overexposed shots. Its also rare that I have problems with red-eye.The navigation of features and menus is also a breeze compared to the cheaper cameras. I think Canon has done quite a good job in making sure their product is user friendly. Even the physical interface is clutter free. You can see they have put a lot of thought into optimising the space around the camera. Holding the camera for shooting and navigating menus seems very natural.There is a slight lag time with the shutter. This is a small problem, especially with kids as the subject.You can choose the resolution of the photos very easily. I use Superfine when I know I want to blow up the picture to 8R and 10R.

No problems.Manual mode allows you to choose things like shutter speed and exposure as well as a few nifty things like Black and White, Sepia etc. Rarely used but nifty nonetheless. I have used the long exposure for some nightshots, using a tripod. I've never succesfully done that with a compact camera before this.The ability for me to go through my photographs, to pick and choose as well as edit a few details before I send them to the developers is INCREDIBLE. Well worth the price of shelling out the cash for a good camera.Connecting to my Win XP laptop with the USB cable(included) was a breeze. The installed software(s) is very good for managing the pictures but does take up a sizable chink of the hard drive.Extras:1) Camera Orientation. The camera knows if the picture taken was vertical or horizontal.2) Photostitch - A feature that makes it A LOT easier to create those long panorama-like pictures by joing seperate photos. Comes with the software for this. Almost but still not quite seamless.Could improve:1) No Battery meter. You are only informed when the battery has like 5-10 minutes of power left. Guess I might need to invest in an extra battery.2) Slight Shutter lag.3) Photo size. I notice that when I send the photos for developing, the picture width is slightly cropped. I don't know if this is because the print paper here is not international standard?

And then a friend and an avid digital photographer (anyone who will spend entire weekends adjusting, tweaking etc their photos in Photoshop is pretty avid to me) suggested I take a good look at his S400 and read some of the reviews.  And then he said something to me that, once I thought about it, really hit home.  He said ... \"because this camera is so small (about the size of a deck of cards) you will take it with you everywhere.  You'll leave the house with it in situations where you would not \"pack up\" another larger camera. It's like taking your wallet.\"  The more I thought about this the more I remembered myself having to \"decide\" if I was going to bring my current and prior cameras with me and liking the idea of not having to \"decide\".Well ... I've had it for more than a year and my friend was absolutely correct.  I bring it with me everywhere without a thought.  There is no \"packing up\" the camera and it is not an inconvenience to have it in my pocket.  The Canon leather case actually has a belt loop so you can carry it that way as well.  Over the past year or so I've taken great pix that I never would have taken otherwise because my camera would not have been with me otherwise.  The quality is outstanding and there are more than enough manual adjustments to suit most.

It was the 2.11 megapixel version. My experience was so positive, that I upgraded to the S400 after 3 years of solid service from my first S100.You can't find a more useful, quality camera at any price. It's powerful, yet very small and light. The hipness factor is alse very high. People love to ogle it. Camera envy!I carry it in my jacket pocket ot attache wherever I go. That's a huge plus on my scorecard. I also have a small camera case from Wal-Mart I bought for $5, just in case I think I need a little more protection for it (like when traveling, or outside a lot). I can wear it on my belt, yet it is well padded, and can carry spare memory cards and an extra battery.The S400 takes 4 megapixel shots. Using an Epson Stylus Photo RX500 (multifunction device: printer/scanner/copier), I printed 4x6 photos and 8.5 x 11 photos. To my eye, both were photo lab quality when printed on premium glossy stock. I used Canon paper for 4 x 6, and HP paper for 8.5 x 11. I believe that the premium glossy photo paper from all the major manufacturers is excellent. Shop price, rather than feeling you are forced to go with the same brand as your printer. I print about 30 4x6 photos for every 1 full page photo.I set my S400 at the highest resolution and the next-to-highest quality. That way, I get all the pixels, yet there is adequate compression. This keeps the files manageable, and you can fit more photos on a memory card. I use a 256MB card, with a 128MB spare. At current prices, everyone can afford to have more memory handy.Not being a camera bug or serious photo hobbyist, I use all the automatic settings I can. Auto focus, auto white level, auto exposure. When it needs a flash, it flashes. The only time I make any adjustments is when I am in sunny conditions or I am close to an object I am shooting (macro).Generally, I just point and shoot, and it is a thing of beauty. Semi-pro camera gurus can probably make this thing take even better shots.Battery life is fine, with the new Lithium-ion cell. It's better than the one that came with the S100. The wall charger they give you is also tiny, and charges it quickly. Die-hards might want an extra charged battery when they are going to take a lot of shots in a short period of time, or when the flash will be used on every shot. I have  never run out of battery juice while in the middle of taking shots. But I don't take 150+ shots without a chance to charge it back up.The 3X optical zoom is better than the old 2X from past models. I disable the optical zoom, so my image stays in native full resolution.I rarely use the video mode, because I have a newer Sony mini-DV camcorder that is incredible for video.It's best to stick with the strengths of each device. Camera: photos. Camcorder: video. The video quality on the S400 is poor, and the digital photo quality on the Sony camcorder is poor. If I can only take one of these with me, the S400 almost always wins. While the Sony camcorder is small and light, it is still about 5x the size and weight of the Canon S400. Convenience often carries the day.I never use the USB connection to connect the camera directly to the computer. I have a 6-in-1 card reader for my computer, and my printer is compatible with all memory types. It's nice to know the direct connection is there if I need it, though.You can't go wrong with the S400. Prices are even starting to come down, as 5 megapixel cameras are coming out.

I can live without all the manual controls since I own the 10D and since this camera is primarily for my wife and for me when I don't want to lug the 10D around.Several have pointed out that since this camera is so small it will always be with you whereas the S50 would be less likely to be carried along because of its increased size.  This is a very good argument!  The camera is SUBSTANTIALLY smaller than its bigger brother the S50.  The form and size factors are what finally won me over.One criticism of the camera.  Low light focusing is less than ideal.  You need to work with the camera to understand its limitations indoors.I am a huge fan of the Canon cameras and I would advise anyone looking for a camera, whether a point and shoot or a DSLR to carefully consider the Canon line since, in my opinion, Canon  currently represents the state of the art.", "Date": "March 8, 2004"}, {"Title": "Tons of features in a small package", "Author": "James D", "ReviewID": "R88BDY5B5LD55", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my S400 for a few weeks now and love it.

Peterson", "ReviewID": "RB6COTIGYKLYA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's a nice looking little camera.  I was looking for a portable one to replace my aging Fujifilm digital, so I tried this one.  I ended up sending it back, since it performs worse than my old one in low light (i.e. indoors).The problem is the focus.  By default (and always, it seems, when in full auto mode), the camera uses a special \"AI\" autofocus.  This puts up a series of green rectangles (when the shutter is half-pressed) on the LCD indicating focus zones.  For one thing, it sometimes picks rectangles that represent differing distances, which doesn't make sense to me, but...  Anyway, some of the shots I took indoors, especially candids, did not come out as focused as I am used to from my old camera.  Note that I did not notice where the green rectangles were, since a couple of these shots were taken quickly by pressing the shutter all the way and not carefully analyzing the pre-focus.I did not try center focus mode (similar to the focusing method in many other cameras) too much, since I did not really give the camera much of a chance after getting some blurry pics.  But unless I misunderstood the interface, it seems that it is impossible to make center focus the default for full auto mode.  Take these comments with a grain of salt, since I did not perform any really scientific tests, and I did not have the camera long.One other thing I didn't like was the shutter button - if pressed off-center (tilted), it seemed to catch a little, giving it a slightly cheap feel.Otherwise, the quality of the images is pretty good for such a small camera (beats my old Fujifilm in image quality for sure - of course that was a circa 1999 1.3 megapixel model!).

As a result, it leaves out many features that might be desired by more advanced photographers (manual focus, aperture/shutter priority, flash exposure compensation,...).  But for the majority of people, the S400 is an excellent point-and-shoot digicam.  If you don't need 4MP, then consider the 3MP Canon S300.Sure, there are smaller digicams out there, made by various manufacturers, but most of the smaller digicams lack an optical zoom.  If you can live without the optical zoom and you want something smaller, consider the 5MP Canon SD10 or a camera from the credit card-sized Casio Elixim series.If you do not need a small digicam, you may want to save some money and go with a Canon A70 or A80.  These cameras, which have larger grips, are especially a good choice for people with larger hands.  Where the S400 feels like it might slip out of the hands, the A70/A80 provide an excellent grip.One final note: if you like water activities, Canon makes a waterproof housing for many of their cameras (S400, A70/A80, etc.).

When CANON says it would not care for  bad pixels if they are less than 0.01%, it means I think two  things: a) this is not the highest quality flat screen that  they could manufacture, and b) that you cannot expect a  really great support.

I am going to talk about why the Sony DSC P10 destroys the Canon S400 and to address the gripes of other reviewers.The only advantages the Canon S400 has over the Sony P10 are as follows:1. Flash is more centered over lens of camera to avoid \"shadow\" effect2. Compactflash memory is cheaper3. Double sided memory sticks are \"bad\"4. The S400 has 9 points of autofocus, compared to the P10's 3Yes, I know the flash on the Sony is not centered over the lens, thus in theory it would cast shadows over the subject, BUT in practice, THIS HARDLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE. For the most part, I have not even noticed that this was possible, but in those small instances if I payed extremely close attention, I could notice that something small and insignificant placed in a very specific way in front of the subject was casting a slight shadow on the subject in like 1 in 100 of the night pictures I take.This is FAR outweighed by the fact that Canon's in general, and this PARTICULAR Canon, has THE WORST lighting problems I have ever seen. SKIN TONES, COMPLETELY wrong. Canon has a history of problems with underexposing color tones and this camera is no different. Using TWO different A400's, the skin tones of people in the pictures often comes out terrible. People's skin often comes out EXTRAORDINARILY yellow and fuzzy. I am not sure what causes this problem, but this ALONE renders the camera completely useless in mild light conditions. Go develop some night pictures off the A400 before you buy it and you'll see what I'm talking about. The skin tones come out all wrong and it is obvious to almost everybody. Especially if you are Asian! They're not THAT yellow! Compare the pictures side by side to the Sony P10 and I guarantee you can tell.First of all, compactflash memory is only cheaper than memory sticks if you don't know how to shop. Sure, if you buy a Viking Compactflash card then it'll be cheaper, but then again you shouldn't be doing that anyways since Viking makes dangerously terrible cards. Furthermore, if you shop on amazon.com, you can buy a 256MB SONY brand memory stick for practically the same price as a reputable maker of a CF card!I agree, that memory stick pros are not that great since they have that really odd copyright protection, but if you plan to only put pictures on this card, then that should not even be an issue. Also, people have complained about the \"double-sided\" memory sticks and how inconvenient they are. Both me and my dad have one and we actually think it's better than a conventional 256MB stick. First of all, if you have an MP3 player then it would be nice to keep MP3's on one side of the card and pictures on the other. You don't want to mix the two, and it's a great way of dividing it. Why would you not want to mix the two? Say you wanted to format the card to delete all your pictures so that you can take a whole new round of pictures. If you had a 256MB compactflash, you would delete all your MP3's as well, or you would have to delete each of your 100 pictures one by one.With the double sided stick, you can just delete one side at a time, leaving all your MP3's. The same holds true if you are just taking only pictures as well. If you want to keep some pictures or movies on your card for a presentation or demonstration on a TV, then you can keep those pictures on one side of the card, and then continue formatting and taking pictures on the other side freely. And when you do have to switch the sides, it really isn't annoying at all. You just take out the card and move one button. This is far easier than tying your shoes. So one reviewer named tmchow complained on switching sides to the memory stick that it was \"Far too much hassle for me.. sounds easy in theory, but in real life, you will hate it\"He must wear velcro shoes or something, because if you can do simple things like tie your shoes, SURELY you can press one button, really it's not hard at all.And WHY on EARTH would a non-professional photographer need NINE points of autofocus?!? That would mean you would like to focus on an object NOT in the center of the picture and leave everything else blurry. So this spectacular feature would come in handy in the following situation, you are taking a picture of two people at a restaurant but you would like to focus on the salt shaker, but leave the two people fuzzy. USELESS. So basically if you would ever like to focus on something completely outside the center of the picture but leave the remaining 90% of the picture fuzzy, buy this Canon for the wonderful autofocus flexibility.So let's look at why the Sony P10 is clearly better:1. I like people's skin to look like how it does in real life.that ALONE should be enough, but let's carry on2. Sony P10 is 5 megapixel3. 20% longer battery life, VERY important in digital photography4. Takes great pictures in the dark, and even has a solid night modeSome people get completely lost in megapixels and think that more megapixels is better and forget the rest of the camera. Not true, megapixels only matter if you are blowing up your pictures to uncommon and extravagant sizes like 20 X 30. In this case, the Sony P10 takes far better night pictures as well as having more megapixels. But if you really insist on messing up everyone's skin tones, go right ahead and buy this camera.People keep talking about how compact the A400 is. Well, in my experience, pants pockets generally are rectangular, not square. Making the Sony P10 a far better fit when it comes to a conventional pocket.Overall, Canon cameras are completely overrated by all those blind Canon lovers.
