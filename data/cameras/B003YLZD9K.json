{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Be Warned", "Author": "I. O'Garro", "ReviewID": "R2C2PWP4B8V9XK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a nice little camera however it is very light and the casing feels like brittle plastic. I fear the battery cover may not last long because I have to press hard to get it closed once the batteries are in it.  It is quite easy to set up once you follow the manual that is on the installation cd.  Even though I don't know much about electronics I was taking nice clear normal pictures and videos within minutes of setting it up.  I love that I am also able to zoom in and out while videotaping which I was unable to do with my other digital camera.But be warned,  I bought this camera mainly because I wanted to get into macro photography and figured that 'the more zoom the merrier'.  This camera is advertised as having 8x digital zoom but its box and manual say it only has 4x digital zoom.  I didn't see any markings on the camera itself so it's 2 votes to 1 that it only has 4x zoom.  I tried taking pictures of a dead mosquito and just got a fuzzy lump.  The same thing happened when I tried a tick.  I'm disappointed.My other problem is that when I playback the videos on the camera (or laptop) there is no sound.  I know the camera has sound because it beeps when I press buttons on it but no sound comes with the video playback.So I took one star off for each problem but other than that I like this camera.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$59.99", "Features": "Vivitar Vivicam 5028 5.1MP Digital Camera, 8x Digital Zoom, 2.4\" Screen", "Name": "Vivitar Vivicam 5028 5.1MP Digital Camera, 8x Digital Zoom, 2.4 Screen", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31R5Zb4CCWL.jpg", "ProductID": "B003YLZD9K"}}
