I'm running 9 of their cameras and have full control via the internet, my phone and directly through the DVR. This system and the cameras are well built and function as good as most business class systems you find but at the fraction of the cost. They have survived both Florida heat and freezing temperatures along with rain and wind. No impact from weather. I will continue to buy their products, but it's worth mentioning that most of these cameras at this price point are generally made from the same manufacturer in China and just rebranded. The biggest difference is finding a brand that stays in business and has more choices and accessories. Besides Q-See, Night Owl is almost identical and also a safe bet.Pros: good aluminum build, average power consumption, decent daytime and nighttime quality and picture, IR throw about what they advertiseCons: 1/4 inch sensor crops a bit of the picture compared to a 1/3 inch sensor, IR leds throw a bit of a spot and should be spaced out and at angles instead of circular.I'd buy again until I can find better quality in this pricepoint.", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.99", "Features": "Color\nCCD\nCable", "Name": "Color Ccd Cam.
