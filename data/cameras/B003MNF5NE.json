{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not recommended.", "Author": "B. Pearce", "ReviewID": "RX9JY2SB1GOPS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "*Review updated July 2013*Pros:+ Good image quality even at the max res of 1600x1200.+ Smooth video at high resolution with relatively little bandwidth consumption (thanks to h264 encoding).+ Better than average lens (it even has a manual iris and some small manual zooming capability).+ Relatively low cost for a 2MP IP camera years ago when this first became available.  Still holds true today.Cons:- Some stability issues, mostly resolved.  It sat in a drawer for over a year due to instability (froze up within 24 hours of powering on).  Finally got it working 7 months ago with new firmware.  Recently the video became corrupted and it required a reboot to fix, but it has been stable otherwise.- Setting the video resolution on the camera lower than native actually crops the video, so you won't get the full field of view unless you have it at native resolution.- Cannot change the JPG compression level.  A native resolution (1600x1200) picture is about 1 MB and a 640x480 picture is about 200kb.  Even 320x240 is ~50kb.  As such, pictures take roughly 5 to 10 times longer to transfer than they should.- The firmware it came with only allowed it to provide JPG pictures at 640x480.  I had to upgrade the firmware to get 1600x1200 JPGs.- The firmware upgrade process does not let you upload a file through your browser.  You have to point it at a server that has the firmware files (GrandStream provides one), then reboot the camera.  The process isn't foolproof and it took approximately 6 reboots before the camera managed to actually update its firmware.- Only Internet Explorer would play video.  Firefox 4 couldn't find the plugin.  Maybe Firefox 3 would work.  Also the plugin is unsigned so I had to change the internet security settings on every computer I wanted to install it on.Other thoughts:This may have been a decent camera in the past when there was little competition but this is 2013 and good 2MP cameras are popping up everywhere.  Considering this camera is not weatherproof, vandal-resistant, or IR compatible, I have to recommend looking elsewhere for a security camera.I am currently using it as a weather cam using a cheap 25mm zoom lens until I have time to set up something better.", "Date": "May 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's better than you think, after you get past the firmware", "Author": "Timothy Cox", "ReviewID": "R24XDQIMKCFV54", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The stock firmware (as stated prior) is junk, locks up, acts weird, SMTP does not work correctly, etc. I am running the BETA firmware on the Grandstream site, and it's totally stable. Camera has been up for weeks without issue.The picture quality is the best of all the Grandstream products, I have not tried the 5MP, so I'm not comparing that.For the guy who wanted to shoot mountains 5 miles away, it's a security camera pal, it needs to be accurate inside of 500 feet (and it can read a license plate at 200 feet easily). That being said, this camera has the feature of replaceable lenses, so I bet you could look around and find a telephoto lens that might just work.The fact that a standalone device can post directly to FTP, Give SMTP alerts, Record locally in HD onto multiple media choices, CALL my SIP telephone and alert me, and other stuff, all for way under $200.00, this thing is bargain of the century. I recommend it to anybody who is technical, if you are Joe-average, you may want to just stick with X10 crap.I would give 5 stars if it came with a mount of some sort.-T", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awful focus issues", "Author": "Mr ISP", "ReviewID": "R2Y3LIQXSQEHPZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The intended use it was for a view of a mountain for a paragliding club.  The mountain was only 5 miles away. The camera was incapable of creating a clear image of the mountain or anything else. It was most disappointing considering the pool of high definition cameras out there such as in your average Android smartphone.  Thinking that I had a bad camera the first time I returned the first one and ordered a second. The second camera turned out to be just as bad as the first; incapable of focusing on anything further away than say maybe couple 100 feet. So I can't recommend this camera.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$253.00", "Features": "High resolution 2 Megapixels CMOS sensor and premium lens to ensure high fidelity picture quality\nSupport advanced real-time H.264 (with multi-streaming-rate) and Motion JPEG at 720P resolution, variable bit rate & frame rate, and video watermark\nSupport sensor alarm input, replay output, USB, SD, integrated Power-over-Ethernet (802.3af), and 24MB pre-/post-even recording buffer\nBuilt-in high performance streaming server to allow 6+ simultaneous HD viewers\nEmbedded video analytics, SIP/VoIP support for full duplex two-way audio as well as video streaming to mobile phones and video phones", "Name": "GrandStream High Definition IP Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41cy-jU5alL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003MNF5NE"}}
