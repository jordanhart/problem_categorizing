{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I love it!", "Author": "J. Chambers", "ReviewID": "R361WHMKWHQ0R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For really serious photography, I use a Nikon D200 with the SB800 flash.  But there are some times when I just want a small, lightweight camera in my pocket, and the Fuji E900 is perfect for that. Unlike most point and shoots, the camera comes on almost instantly, and the shutter lag is close to (but not quite equal) an SLR. My biggest complaint is the lack of a hotshoe for a hardwired external flash, so I wouldn't use the E900 indoors where a heavy flash is needed. I actually would only rate the E900 at a 4.5 because of this.The optics are as crisp as any point and shoot that I've seen. There is a bit of chromatic abberation, particularly at wide angle, but it's not too noticeable in most situations.A huge plus is that you have full manual control of your exposures if you want to or need to do that. In my opinion, a camera has to have that feature if it's to be used for serious photography. But if you just want to point and shoot and have the camera do everything, you can do that too.Another minor objection is that the camera uses an xD card, so I couldn't use any of the CF or SD cards that I already have. When you buy an xD card, be sure to get an Olympus Type H card, not the slower Type M.Overall, a really nice little camera, especially for a little over $300.", "Date": "May 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Point and Shoot Digital Camera", "Author": "John Frisbie", "ReviewID": "RW9R4WTBHMKH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After buying and trying several cameras over the last year, I can finally say that I've found the right camera for me. Beautiful pictures, fast action -- super-fast start up and minimal shutter lag, solid feel, and excellent zoom picture quality.Additionally, it uses AA batteries (recommend rechargables), gets plenty of pix out of them and of course, there's 9 megapixels of info to play with.I've only been playing for a week or so, but I've used in low-light restaurant situations, on the streets of New York at night, in the car and sitting on the couch at home all with no flash and the pictures look great. It's not a miracle-worker, but these are the best low-light pix I've seen.Daylight and flash pix look amazing. Bright broad daylight pix in the park on 'Auto' mode turned out perfectly balanced. (love the Histogram feature in manual mode for balancing more complex shots - basically a small waveform monitor on the lcd screen. Awesome!)Manual controls are a bit tough to memorize - focus requires touching two buttons - but what else to do with a point-and-shoot of this size?But, it HAS all the manual controls - unlike most digital cameras of this size.I've tried Olympus, Canon, Nikon, Pentax and even another Fuji. To say I am pleased is an understatement.Is it perfect? Nope. Eats power. But, better to have more rechargeable AAs than to have to carry around a charger for a dang proprietary battery.And, Consumer Reports is right, this camera has amazing image quality.", "Date": "March 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fuji E900 Best all-around ProAm Point&Shoot; under $800usd", "Author": "Copper Minehart", "ReviewID": "RDAW5IC6S4VKP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Strengths:FAST.OUTSTANDING in low light.Good semi-wide angle/semi-fast lens.Great battery type! (especially now that 2700Mah versions are available).Great ccd and resolution.Great ergonomics (tall enough to hold yet small enough for your pocket).Weaknesses:Menu needs to be straightened out (RAW should be grouped with the jpegs within the F button) and a manual focus button combo would have been great...I hope Fuji is listening! How about a USEFUL RAW utility (or at LEAST the ability to download one from the site!!)??SLOW flash recycle timeNo Autofocus assist lightNo Image stabilizationNo Programmable settings button.Lens is only Semi Wide (32mm@f2.8 equivalent to a 35mm camera lens).Wide angle macro & movie modes only (no telephoto in macro or movie mode)Max XD Memory card is only just moving to 2GB.(Should use the Olympus high-speed H-series XD for best movie perf).No performance/quality probs.Summary: This is a strong candidate for the serious amateur in need of a point and shoot for backups or vacation...It is also VERY easy to use, for the significant other of that serious amateur.I studied medium to high-end point&shoots; and prosumers for 6 months prior to buying the Fuji E900 in April of '06. While the E900 didn't have everything I wanted, in the end, it was the clear choice. the CCD (and sample image output), a real viewfinder, and the ergonomics were keys to my choice.High resolution, moderately high level of amateur photographer type functions (read: manual settings, auto bracketing, and RAW), fast focusing, decent flash, macro mode, good low light ability, a mem-card (only) restricted movie mode, compact size, ergonomic shape, quality build, easy to use modes and ultimately, a real viewfinder.The three finalists in my decision group were the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX1, the Canon S80, and the Fuji E900.I have to say, the Lumix, with that beautiful Leica lens took some fantastic shots..but my God! does it have a noisy, and I mean NOISY ccd!!!! if you are only shooting indoors with the flash, and you can look the iso to 80, then it will reward you with incredible images! but this is not my reality. I originally had settled on the Lumix but that noisy ccd and a LACK OF A REAL VIEWFINDER (Panasonic are you listening??) were deal killers in the end. The Lumix is just about useless when you are outside in bright light, and with the sun at your back...a viewfinder is really key hear.Moving to the Canon S80, it has a great lens as well, and does MUCH better with slightly higher iso numbers, but man, that soap bar is bulky! Its dimensions are not at all conducive to actually holding the camera stolidly. I did like the 1024x768 movie mode, but at 15fps the output looks inferior to the regular old 640x480@30fps of the Fuji. The S80 does 640x480 as to, but the ergonomics and weight/mass of the S80 sunk it..but at least it has a REAL VIEWFINDER (Panasonic, are you listening??). The S80 just felt dated. I think its time for Canon to step up with something new in the Point&Shoot; department.The Fuji E900, with the Fujinon lens had the poorest lens quality (IMHO) relative to the extremely high quality of the Canon L series lens on the S80 and that magical Leica lens on the Pani. That said, it is a fine lens that can hold its head high, especially in combination with that great ccd, excellent ergonomics, and a very complete set of features...the Fuji was a better choice for me. It is important to note that I chose this camera over those with image stabilization, and a focus assist ...I found the E900 to be superior to them even though it is not so equipped.I really like the \"Natural\" program mode. With the 5th generation SuperHADD the colors are good and the low light capability is REALLY impressive. That mode (Natural) lets you get a lot of battery life out of the camera as it lets you preclude the flash A LOT.  Note: the Natural Mode is really noisy so if you want to print anything bigger than 4x6 you should take a look at some sample output first (but keep in mind that getting the shot is better than missing it, even if it means a little more noise).The 800 iso actually WORKS..sure it is a little noisy at that level...but we ARE talking about a $300 dollar point&shoot;! Just amazing...It really is an amazing little camera. Kudos to Fuji for having the stones to stick the SuperHADD from the S9000 into a compact point & shoot! I really hope they evolve this little model more.I was worried about the majority-plastic construction, but it is solid yet light weight, and so far, no complaints...in fact if it had been made completely of metal it would have probably made it substantially heavier.The use of double-A (AA) batteries are great for the traveler.It is important to point out that the gripes really are minor and amazingly fixable...if Fuji wanted to support this \"fringe\" camera a little more ( it IS so much more than the herd of 38mm-160mm equiv. cams out there). I think they could do a software and firmware update and fix 90% of my gripes. And I should also point out that my gripes are only there because the capabilities and performance of this camera just taunt you to want the whole amateur-shooting match. I mean to say, this cam has all the right parts and it does a damned good job of providing a DSLR user with most of the goodies he or she is accustomed to...while allowing your wife or husband to use it as the point and shoot that most people will use it for.GRIPES:I agree with some other reviewers, digging thru the menu to get to the RAW mode is just plain stupid...It belongs above the 9M JPEG setting on the F button!!!Why couldn't they make the RAW format a lIItle bIt friendlier?? I suspect they hid the RAW mode from ready use because at 18M per pic, you cannot take even a SINGLE shot with only the onboard memory (16M)...which also seems silly.Also, while the screen power-up button on the back is really handy for reviewing images (the lens stays parked to conserve the batteries), and other housekeeping, but when you try to power the camera back down (in this mode) via the same button...it actually causes a full power up and lens deployment to occur...what were they thinking?This camera really NEEDS a 4G memory card...1G was fine when you were shooting with 2M to 4M sensor sizes, but this baby has a fantastic 9M sensor!  It is impressive that Fuji was able to create a very small format sensor with such great performance: low noise; high dynamic range; excellent color; etc...it just begs to be shot in RAW..if if if...  :-)", "Date": "September 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Overall, A Very Good, Feature Rich, Point & Shoot Camera", "Author": "Stephen Blythe \"henfan\"", "ReviewID": "R1LPWNG5C8D7BJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought this camera based on reviews found on Amazon, and for the most part, have not been disappointed. You've probably read the other long reviews, so I'll just summarize what we found to be positives and negatives with this camera:POSITIVES:  *  the ease of point and shoot is amazing.  *  the ability to drop out of \"point and shoot\" mode to other more detailed methods is  extensive. Most likely, you'll find a mode that works for you.  *  the 9MP granularity makes zooming in w/ photo software a snap. Unless you go crazy with post-processing software zooming, you'll be fine.NEGATIVES:  *  a little bit too much delay between taking photos when using the flash (sometimes slow between photos without flash, too). Dropping the resultion down from 9MP helps, but then you lose some picture quality.  *  no AC adapter is provided - you have to buy one separately. This may cause you headaches if you intend to download photos via USB, which drains power from the transmitting device. (Note that many of the larger cpacity memory cards cannot be read by most existing card reading hardware, so you may need to use the USB cable.)  *  Eats AA alkaline batteries like crazy. Yes, you can use disposable batteries, but don't expect more than 6-8 pictures per pair of AA's that you use. The supplied rechargables, on the other hand, are amazing - we got at least 100 photos off of their first charge!All in all, a camera that has proven to be well worth the money.", "Date": "November 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent Choice, Reasonable Price", "Author": "TomPaine", "ReviewID": "R398ZGHC114BLH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was considering spending up to $1,000 on a digital SLR, but opted for this 9 megapixel Fuji instead.  I made the right choice.  It's packed with advanced features that you would expect from an SLR (auto bracketing, choice of auto, aperture priority, shutter priority, or full manual exposure) but it's also a great point-and-shoot if you just want to keep it on auto.  You have to press a button to make the flash pop up, which I like because it gives me control over when and how I use the flash, but if you want the camera to be completely automatic and idiot-proof then that might be a problem for you.  I got the Olympus 1GB memory card because someone told me it is faster than the Fuji 1 MB card, and boy is it ever fast.  1 second or less between frames without the flash, 2-3 seconds or less with the flash and fresh batteries.  Great battery life.  Only downside of this camera is that, due to a software difference, you can't take the memory card out and insert it into a PictBridge card reader such as the one on my Dell photo printer.

Should have 5 stars", "Author": "Bruce Kimball \"brucealan\"", "ReviewID": "R2SJG27JKJJTQI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received the latest issue of PC Magazine (Oct 06). The E900 is given one of the highest ratings in this issue. Considering that this is several months after my initial review, I think this shows the camera has stood up under the test of time, at least for digital anythings. I'm upgrading to 5 stars, although I don't see how to do that with Amazon's interface. The rest here is from my original review:This is my first digital camera, so call me a newbie (just not to my face - I hate that term), and don't expect a high-level review here. I have no connection to the photography/image industry other than eyeballs and a credit card. I bought this camera based on published recommendations, including Consumer Reports (a best buy), some other professional sources, and a consensus of opinions on Amazon. The CR probably had the most impact, since vested interests can write an Amazon review, and most magazines/web sites dedicated to photography and computers change their recommendations in the time it takes to snap a shutter or revise ad rates. I notice that most of the criticisms of the camera are from people who had hardware problems with it. A review is one good outlet for frustrations, so it's useful to read them, but don't let the stars influence everything. I have also found that reviews can be a good source for technical support. They may walk you through a problem you otherwise would have to research (gasp!) or experiment (oh no!) to solve. I installed one of those HP all-in-one printers totally with the aid of Amazon's reviewers.I like the large pixel capacity, the non-proprietary batteries (rechargeable AAs! with charger included), and the magnification choices, among other things. It connected perfectly to my computer - it registered as an additional drive, and I treat it like a flash drive (which it is), copying and deleting the images straight off of it. I installed the software, but I really haven't used it much, and I don't think you need it at all. In my book, the fewer the software hoops, the better. I'm sure there are some things that are easier to do with the software than without it, but the point is you can use it without a lot of installation. I bought the 1 Gb memory card, a size which is fairly recent, and it's like having a glutton's dream come true.So far, the photos (my wife, her cat, my yard) in daylight and at night have been good. Nobody has offered me any money for them (the photos), but that's probably not the camera's fault. The disadvantage of the batteries is that they are large and significantly increase the volume, making this camera too big to be a pocket device (unless you want to impress Mae West). And, as others observe, there is a boatload of features - almost as many as on my wristwatch.

For the price you pay for this camera you can do alot. For beginners like me it takes some playing around to figure out all the manual settings. The cool thing is you can always put it in auto mode or set it to one of the programmed settings as well.  Once I figured out how to set the manual setting I realized how great of pictures you can get out of this camera.  One thing I really wanted was a camera that you didn't have to wait on. It takes less than 2 seconds on startup and only a couple seconds for the flash between shots. The 4X zoom isn't exactly impressive but the 9MP image quality makes up for that so you can always crop your photos and still get nice close ups.  Battery life is pretty good compared to most cameras I've used.  The video quality is even better then what I was expecting. With a 1GB card you can get 15 minutes of video on the highest setting.

Pasia", "ReviewID": "R3GKKVLOHIY3J7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this camera based on reviews I read on amazon and elsewhere on the net.First off, the bads. This model has terrible purple fringing. However, it can be minimized, but not eliminated, by not shooting \"wide open\" (aka with a large aperture=low aperture number). If I am shooting pics outdoors with clouds or a bright sun peeking through the leaves, a smaller aperture significantly minimizes the problem. You'll have to be smart about framing the picture if you don't want to do clean-up in Photoshop.Next, if you're a fan of RAW shooting mode (and this camera has that capability), the RAW option is buried deep in the menu (some 10 clicks away). The bundled software to manipulate the RAW files is also weak (it only allows you to save into TIFF). Fuji should definitely move the RAW option to the \"F\" button's menu and bundle its pro RAW software with the successor to the E900.The E900's auto shooting mode is also quite noisy. The pictures always come out better using the \"P\" mode. The \"N\" or natural mode is surprisingly usable, but use it sparingly because the camera cranks up the ISO and pictures can get noisy as well.The battery door looks and feels flimsy. I get the feeling that if I press too hard on the batteries the battery door could come loose or, worse, break. The springs pushing against the batteries are too snug.Now for the goods. The flash is very powerful, especially given its size. I also have a Canon Elan IIe and the flash on the E900 looks and feels more powerful. Impressive!The E900 takes regular AA batteries, and Fuji bundled very good rechargeables with the E900, along with a travel charger. They did not skimp on that, thankfully.There is also a tiny (but usable) viewfinder for the old school types (or for those times that the LCD is washed out in bright sunlight).The menu is intuitive once you get the hang of it. Much more intuitive than the one my now-ancient Sony DSC-P31.Also, given its 9MP resolution, even aggressively cropped pictures look fantastic. The colors are vibrant and very well saturated.There's plenty to like about the E900. Just make sure you know how to avoid purple fringing and you won't be disappointed!", "Date": "July 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good camera and features.

My favorite was a Fuji.For digitals, my current stable includes these cameras:- Canon A520 (4 megapixel) workhorse- Sony DSC-W7 (7.2MP) - 2.5\" viewfinderThe new addition:- FujiFilm E900 (9MP) - 2\" viewfinderFor the work I do, I needed the raw format and 9-10MP and this Fuji E900 camera fits the bill.  Originally, I wasn't looking for a point-and-shoot.  Was hoping to get a 10MP and RAW which prices you out of the compact camera range into more expensive SLRs.  This Fuji fits nicely in between - not quite bleeding edge 10MP but very good and near point-and-shoot size.NOTE: As others have mentioned, this camera was rated high by Consumer Reports.Here are my ratings:Pros====- Good ergonomics- Fast On/off/store- supports RAW (it really wasn't that hard to find in the menus)- AA batteries (my Canon, Sony and Fuji all use AA NiMH rechargables)- Photoshop pulls the raw image right in (it's a supported camera)[...]Cons====- The Fuji E900's 2\" view finder a little small (same as my 4MP Canon A520) but this camera *is* a few years old.- Flimsy camera in terms of plastic quality.  Fuji's cameras are built to a price though this one's a good value at today's prices.  The Sony W7 feels more substantial.  The Sony survived a drop of 4 feet onto pavement (same day I bought the E900 - go figure)- 16MB XD card included can't even fit *ONE* raw image and throws a \"card full\" immediately after setting the format to \"RAW\" *before* I even took a picture.  I was waiting on a 1GB XD accessory card but geez, not even ONE raw photo out-of-the-box???- About 1/3 larger than my Sony W7.  The Fuji is no longer a \"fit in shirt pocket\" compact camera but the quality and the higher MP is worth it.Other cameras looked at:-Panasonic DMC-FZ50 10.1MP - the one I wanted but too much $$$-Fujifilm Finepix S9000 9MP - not a compact. Cheaper than Panasonic-Fujifilm Finepix S9100 9MP - not a compact.  \"  \"-Canon PowerShot A640 10MP - Great specs. Great value. My #2 choice.

Once I got back to the State's and re-entered college, I could not afford to take and develop all the pictures anymore, so I sold all my equipment.  Recently I have wanted to get back into photography and was intrigued by the point and shoot digital market.  The cost of developing prints limited me in my desire to take lots of pictures of a given subject. Plus, I want to do more than just snap photos a family get-togethers.  Digital cameras solve these problems and have finally grown up from their 'toy-like' beginnings.  Consumer Reports rated this camera as a \"Best Buy\" for an Advanced Compact.  All I can say about this camera is \"Wow!\"In addition to the \"Auto\" point and shoot, the Fujifilm Finepix E900 has modes for natural light, portraits, sports, after dark, plus a 'Photo' mode that lets you change focusing method, photometric method, white balance, flash intensity. It also has functions to allow up to 40 shots in burst mode and auto-bracketing of shots by changing the exposure value (EV) of your shots.  You can also work with the shutter speed, apperture setting or just do everything manually.  It also does movies up to 30 minutes long on a 1 GByte xD photo card.  That is what makes this advanced point and shoot great.  I can experiment with a subject and take a hundred shots just to see how the camera responds and then keep all, some, or none of pictures and I have not spent a cent for photo-finishing.In about 3 weeks, I have taken over 1,100 shots while trying to learn the basics of operation.  It is a very easy camera to use.  It is forgiving in the Auto mode and most of the other modes also.  If you want a camera that does more than point and shoot, then the E900 is a good camera to consider.  Sucking the pictures off the camera and into the 'My Pictures' folder your PC is as simple as plugging the camera into a USB port and clicking OK.  The software included with the camera does basic editing.A word of warning, however, buy a large xD memory card when you buy the camera.  The camera shipps with a 16 Mb xD-Picture Card that holds about three 9-megapixal pictures!  A 1.0 GB xD holds about 200 shots, while a 2.0 GByte xD will hold about 400 shots.  You can, of course, crank the quality down to as little as 2-megapixals.  Also buy rechargable 'AA' batteries.  The E900 will accept regular 'AA' batteries, but the life of two standard alkaline batteries was about 20 shots compared to about 160 with the rechargable ones.I am still learning the bells and whistles, but thus far, I like what the camera does and how it does it.", "Date": "February 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Its okay....", "Author": "avid photographer", "ReviewID": "R20QPLNEOK7SPC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had a few problems with this camera.

I wanted a reliable model with some improvements over my old camera, like decreased time between pictures, more zoom, etc.  The Finepix E900 worked fine for three weeks or about 100 pictures.  Then the pictures became distorted.  It had a one-year warranty so I sent it back to Fujifilm to be repaired, and was sent a price quote of over $100.  Customer service explained that because the camera was damaged the warranty did not apply.  I did get some good use out of the camera for the short time I had it and carried it with me nearly every day.  I imagine that the damage must have occurred when I carried it in my backpack.  It is lightweight and the body is made of plastic but I wasn't prepared for it to be that fragile.  My old Cannon camera survived more than a year of almost-daily use and transportation in suitcases, purses and backpacks and suffered only scratches on the body.  If I had known the Finepix E900 would be so delicate I would certainly have opted for a more durable model with a better warranty.  Now the dilemma is whether to pay for the repairs knowing that it couldn't stand up to what, for me, was normal use, or cut my losses and save up for a different brand.(Incidentally, Fujifilm's customer service both via the website and the phone is average to poor.)The Finepix E900 seemed like a great camera and I might recommend it for more infrequent use, but if you intend to travel a lot, use it ofen, or expose it to friends, kids, and varied climates, I would look into other brands.", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Natural Light Mode - Sweet!", "Author": "SPED Teacher", "ReviewID": "RBZRDNDTN63UC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Prior owner of 4 Kodak, Olympus, and Fugi Finepix digital cameras.

Jemmott", "ReviewID": "R39KZ5JVNMNGF1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After my Finepix E550 (and E900 predecessor) was \"liberated\" from me, I decided to make use of all those xD memory cards and rechargeable AA batteries and purchase the E900.I'll start off by saying, at this point, this model was released 21 months ago. That is a fairly long time for any electronic item. That being said, like the E550 it still takes beautiful true color photos without much lag between them. It starts and extends it's lens less than 2 seconds. On the auto setting it's picture quality is as good as most current point and shoot cameras . Where this camera differentiates itself is using the many manual controls at your disposal. It's definitely aimed at the enthusiast set and if you have a firm grasp of apertures, shutter speeds, exposures and the like, you can see it's potential. And potentially it can take some very impressive pictures. After 300 shots I still think the E550 has better color representation but the E900 photos still look more natural than say my Canon 800IS. At ISO 80, 100 and 200 it's pretty noise free, even in low light situations. The noise starts to creep in at ISO 400 buts it's still very usable. At ISO 800 be prepared to run your photos through some kind of software noise reduction as they very grainy. This noise makes the \"Natural Light\" mode hit or miss in my opinion. While it makes it easier to take low light pictures without a flash you can't control the ISO speed independently. This means in low light without a flash, the camera almost always goes to ISO 800 and that brings the noise. Of course this is easily remedied with manual mode. The menus are not very user friendly so if you plan to go manual be prepared to do a lot of 2 handed button pressing. It would be nice if from shot to shot you didn't have to go into the menus at all.For beginners, the E900 is a very capable point & shoot in auto mode. But, if you're more advanced and are a little creative this is your camera. With the full manual controls, RAW image capture, 9 megapixels and a very very friendly price, it's the perfect companion to a Digital Photography For Dummies book.", "Date": "July 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "disappoints - i wanted to love this camera!", "Author": "Paul Christensen \"gadget geek\"", "ReviewID": "R43M5ATE4B34Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After my trusty Olympus D40 Zoom died at the end of a recent vacation, I spent about 30 hours researching a replacement that would offer (a) outstanding image quality, (b) speed, (c) compact size, (d) use standard AA batteries, (e) full manual controls, (f) optical viewfinder. From many (but not all) reviews, it looked like the E900 would satisfy my requirements.Unfortunately, the E900 that I purchased fell seriously short in two \"show stopper\" areas - image quality and speed. I have reason to suspect (but was never able to verify) that the unit I purchased was defective, as every image I took had enormous amounts of noise and lack of detail in low-contrast areas of the picture. I tried full-auto, as well as manually adjusting ISO and compression settings to no avail. What leads me to believe my unit was defective is:(1) I can't imagine any manufacturer releasing a camera that takes pictures as bad as my E900 did(2) when I took a picture of a subject illuminated by sunlight, the camera's EXIF comments indicated that the flash was required but not used. And yes, this daylight picture had fuzzy details and lots of noise.Interestingly, of the 6 or so professional reviews of this camera in other sites, one reviewer did indicate problems with \"muddied details\" that could not be corrected by adjusting ISO or image compression. In that reviewer's example picture, blades of grass appeared \"watercolored\". The unit I purchased was far worse than this, but had similar problems with detail.The second deal breaker that ultimately had me return this and look for a different model was the speed of the user interface. Granted, this is a 9MP camera, but the speed of image playback, as well as zooming in and out on a picture is just GLACIALLY slow. My 4-year-old 4MP Olympus ran circles around the playback performance, not to mention offering a better user interface.It is for this reason that I offer my 3-star rating, giving image quality the benefit of the doubt. (If I had rated this camera on image quality I saw, it would have received 1 star!)It's a shame, because there are lots of things to like about this camera:- 9MP offers plenty of opportunity to crop and maintain outstanding resolution- \"Natural Light\" mode offers ability to take pictures without the harshness of flash- camera body is extremely well made from mostly metal parts and rubberized grip- extremely fast startup time and shot-to-shot time- uses 2 AA batteries- includes 2500 mAh batteries AND a worldwide travel charger with the camera bundle- offers full manual controls- RAW image support (you better have VERY large xD cards for this)What I didn't care for:- very poor image quality, muddied details (may have been a problem with my unit)- no ability to adjust JPEG compression beyond two settings (and the \"better\" setting was in my opinion too compressed)- glacially slow playback response and zoom in/out of playback image- user interface is quirky, and doesn't seem nearly as well thought out and streamlined as competitors (try an Olympus or a Canon and compare)- uses xD cards, which are only used by Fuji and Olympus so they're more expensive- very slow when writing very large files (which would be required for RAW mode); some say this is a problem with xD cards in generalIn the end, I took a step back and ended up buying a Canon A540. Unfortunately \"only\" 6MP, but at least with my Fuji E900, the difference in picture quality was phenomenal (and I have sample images taken at the same time to prove it). And, the Canon has a much more polished user interface, uses standard and high-speed SD media, and is a noticeably smaller camera while still using AA batteries. It's a shame, because I had high hopes for a 9MP compact camera.", "Date": "April 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great pictures, but with faults", "Author": "G.

The downloading is easy and in general it's a \"fine\" camera.  However....the flash on it is nothing short of a nightmare.  It's constantly over exposing every subject.  I find it practically un-usable.  The only way I can get the image I'm looking for in a lower light setting is to set the ISO to 800.  If it had a 1600 ISO I wouldn't need the flash at all practically but it doesn't offer that.The other thing I don't like that I didn't realize I wouldn't like is that it doesn't have it's own cradle in which to charge the batteries.  The batteries have to be removed and charged seperately.  Doesn't sound like a big deal but it is a pain when you think about it.  The batteries lose their charge even when the camera isn't on which results in picking up the camera after 2 days and realizing it has no juice.  Intensely dissatisfying.This camera also has a REALLY LONG DELAY from pushing the button to taking the picture.  This results in lots of closed eyes and stupid faces.

Kreis \"livedeadcat\"", "ReviewID": "R1CCTI6TLIT88F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This compact camera was announced on July 28, 2005 for Fuji's 2006 catalog, and was dropped from their 2008 catalog. That was a long run for a compact model camera. Fujifilm has moved on from it's E-series, and none of their current compact models offer a configuration comparable to the E900. At the time of this writing, remaindered E900 stock is still available on the Internet for around $200, less than half its original retail price.  A contemporary camera model with a similar, albeit more fully featured, configuration would be the 12 MP Canon G9, at about $450.The nine megapixel \"Super CCD\" featured on this model caused a minor sensation when it was announced.  This sensor is still being used in the Fujifilm S9600 model. Super CCD sensors are unique in that their pixels are arranged diagonally, rather than horizontally.  This reduces aliasing along diagonal lines (and supports pixel-doubling in Photoshop's ACR).I considered purchasing this camera when it first came out, but opted instead for a dSLR model. But, now I wanted a compact walk-around camera for a project where a dSLR kit would be too much baggage.  The E900 again came under consideration.  I was attracted by these features:~ RAW capture capability (I prefer to shoot everything in RAW).~ 2xAA battery power is cheap, lightweight and long-lasting (e.g., Sanyo Eneloop).~ The high ratings for the E900 I read on internet camera review sites.At just over nine ounces, batteries included, this camera fit my requirement for portability. It is too big to fit in my shirt pocket, but I avoid putting precision instruments in shirt pockets.Compact cameras are trending toward ever-smaller (including hi-res cameras in cell phones), while dSLR cameras are incorporating more consumer features, like \"live view,\" image stabilization and face recognition.  I guess I am becoming a digital Luddite, because Minox-sized cameras do not appeal, nor do SLR cameras laden with techno-froufrou. Offer me a camera with extended dynamic range, higher sensitivity and greater resolution, and I am listening.  A camera that pays expressway tolls has some other consumer than me in mind.The RAW capability of the Fujifilm E900 is seriously under-supported by the manufacturer, to the point of being counterproductive.~ Selecting RAW capture requires drilling deep into the setup menu on the camera.~ The RAW developing software included with the camera provides no image adjustments and outputs TIFF files at only 8-bit tonal depth. This obviates all(!) the value of RAW capture.~ The exposure bracketing feature is not available in RAW capture mode.I shoot RAW because I process all of my images in Photoshop, where RAW images, with their 12-bit tone depth, accommodate much greater image manipulation before tones start to degrade.  Also, using Adobe Camera Raw (ACR), I can optimize white balance and realize another f-stop of dynamic range.I appreciate that most camera users would not find RAW capture to be of value.  Photographers using this camera are likely to use $100 software to adjust their images, which typically functions at 8-bit tonal depth. The extra image data captured in RAW cannot be used by these programs.  It makes sense, therefore, that Fuji has dropped RAW support from their current models, except for their Pro dSLR and two high-end \"bridge\" models.Here are the compromises/limitations I have discovered so far, comparing images from the E900 to ones from my dSLR:~ Noise in the shadows.  Pixels can't decide what color they are.~ Color noise.  Again, pixels can't decide what color they are.~ Chromatic aberrations (colored fringes along high contrast edges. I can compensate for some of this when I make my adjustments in ACR).~ Range of f-stops is limited (f-8 is the highest value).~ Macro setting works only at the widest focal length, producing \"big nose\" distortion.~ The tiny pop-up strobe is only good for fill flash, and even then only at close range.The camera has a big hunk of chrome bling on the grip, giving it the look of a '58 Roadmaster.  On my camera, I covered it up with a piece of gaffer tape.I am surprised and delighted by the resolution of this 9-MP compact camera when compared to my 8-MP dSLR, considering the glass used in each. I appreciate that I can get immediate exposure feed-back on the image I just shot, including a histogram and flashing pixels to show saturation.

Pomeroy", "ReviewID": "R2M1BDQYLCCWWV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had mine for about nine months. It's an interesting thing, a cheap compact digital camera with a very high resolution for its price bracket, a full range of manual photography controls, and a RAW mode that lets you apply all the image processing yourself. It has some quirks and overall I was both impressed and a little disappointed with it. It feels like a budget digital camera body/lens with the heart of a mid-range fixed-lens quasi-SLR. You've probably read lots of reviews on the internet, and I won't reiterate them. In general the camera doesn't seem to have much of a following, it's rarely mentioned on websites, and I assume it has been discontinued. It is just barely mentioned on Fuji's website. I believe it was the last of Fuji's E-series cameras.On the positive sise, it has a non-interpolated nine megapixel resolution, which is still competitive nowadays. Nine megapixels is overkill for most applications, but it's very useful if you like to crop the images, because they remain high-resolution even after you've chopped half of the picture away. You can go down to five, three, or two megapixels, and VGA. The nine megapixel resolution has normal and fine JPG options, the others do not. In RAW mode a 1gb XD card stores 54 images. 9mp fine gets you 228 pictures, the rest hover around 1,000 pictures, give or take a few hundred.The camera is small and light, and fits into a pocket easily. There is a full range of manual photography options. You can set the shutter speed, aperture, ISO level, there are various autofocus modes, and you can bracket the exposure, although you can only bracket by a maximum of one f-stop. You can shoot RAW. You can have a live histogram display on the LCD screen, although you have to hold down a button. Startup time is very quick, the zoom and autofocus are fairly quiet although not silent. You don't hear them in a crowd. The camera runs on 2xAA batteries, which are available in every shop in the world. The camera comes with a pair of batteries and a charger, which is handy. It uses tiny XD cards which can be had cheaply online. Windows XP sees the camera as a standard external storage device, rather like a USB memory stick, so you can just drag and drop the pictures onto your PC rather than having to use proprietary software. In fact you can use the camera as a USB stick, if you want, you can use it to carry MP3 files around, such as Paul McCartney's 1986 album Press to Play, which is fully as bad as the critics say, it's awful. I imagine he wrote \"However Absurd\" as a copy of \"I am the Walrus\", but he got it all wrong.You set the custom white balance by photographing e.g. a grey card, and using that as a template. You cannot however take several pictures and use them as white balance templates, as in some professional cameras, but at least you have a custom option. Alternatively you can shoot RAW and set the white balance later on.The image quality has been covered extensively on the internet. In low ISO modes using the camera's image processing, the image quality is very good in daylight, not bad indoors, but the camera has an odd shutter speed limitation that bothers me. I will write about this later. At 200 ISO and up the noise reduction gives everything an unpleasant plastic quality that resembles the work of George Seurat. The noise reduction algorithm tends to make the images look grainy in an unpleasant way. If you shoot flat surfaces such as walls and skies etc it's not so bad, but detailed objects suffer. If however you shoot with a lower ISO mode, but with a longer shutter speed, it's not so bad, indeed the low-light image quality is impressive if you use a tripod. Part of the reason I am so harsh on the camera's image quality is that the image flaws are very apparent when viewed at 1:1 on the screen, because the pictures are so large. If you crop the picture and then squash it down for the internet, say 1024x768, the grain isn't nearly as noticeable. If you shoot RAW you can bypass the noise reduction entirely. With RAW at ISO 80 there's a certain amount of grain, but it's not unpleasant grain, it has a film-like quality. The camera takes a few seconds to save each RAW file. I believe it interpolates them to 18mp and then de-interpolates them back down to 9mp again, which must take time.Battery life seems to be good. I have taken it with me around and about, and shot a couple of hundred pictures a time, at nine megapixels, with enough juice left over to look at them, download them, and fiddle with the camera afterwards, using 2500 Ni-MH batteries. It's not a problem to carry around a spare set of AAs, or buy them, or borrow them.The camera has some problems. The lens has a slightly wider field of view than other compact cameras, which is theoretically great, except that it distorts around the edges. If you take a shot of a painting, for example, the edges of the painting bulge out a little bit. You can fix this with software but it's a bind. The lens doesn't cope well with flare, so if you shoot a night scene with streetlights the lights will have stars coming out of them, and they will probably have a purple cast. There's a lot of purple fringing around the edges of things. I wish that Fuji had used a better lens. You can fix most of these problems with software, but as I say, it's boring to do so.The maximum shutter time is fifteen seconds, at least in manual mode. In practice, if you set the camera to P or AUTO the maximum shutter time is 1/4 second, which isn't long enough at f2.8 if you want to take shots indoors without a flash (perhaps you have a tripod, or a very steady hand, or a steady beer glass, and you don't want to blind people). You could use shutter priority mode, in which case the maximum shutter speed is three seconds, which is not such a problem but why the limitation? It's a shame there isn't a simple automatic setting that lets you just point and shoot without limiting the maximum shutter speed. That's one point in favour of my old Olympus XA, or Yashica Electro. With those cameras you press the button and PAF, the shutter stays open as long as it needs to stay open.There are some minor niggles. The flash isn't motorised, and so you have to manually open and close it. After you take a flash picture, the camera shows you the picture and then the screen goes blank for a second or so, presumably waiting for the flash to recharge. The body feels lightweight and hollow. It's very plastic, with some silvery plastic bits that look silly. There's a gap around the USB port which looks as though it will let dust into the camera's innards. The master program dial feels flimsier than the equivalent Canon Powershot dial, and doesn't click as positively. I often find myself pulling the Finepix out of a pocket, to find that it has flipped to one of the other shooting modes.If you set the camera to take a time delay exposure, subsequent exposures do not use time delay, and so you have to set time delay over and over again. This sounds picky, but it's a real problem if you're taking a lot of product photographs, perhaps using the macro mode. You want as little camera shake as possible, and the self-timer is ideal for this, but with the E900 you have to press MENU RIGHT UP MENU after every single shot. Not fun if you have to take several dozen pictures.A final niggle is that the option to shoot RAW is buried in one of the setup menus, rather than being right at the top level. You've probably read this complaint in all the other reviews. My guess is that most people who buy this camera do so in order to shoot RAW, and so they notice how fiddly it is to select. If you want to shoot at five megapixels or change to 3:2 aspect ratio there is a dedicated image quality menu button. But for RAW you have to press MENU DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN SET DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN RIGHT UP SET, and the same again to turn it off.Oddly, and this isn't really a criticism, the wider 3:2 aspect ratio setting produces images that have a greater horizontal resolution than the standard 4:3 aspect ratio. It's as if the camera is expanding the pictures outwards rather than just cropping off the top of bottom. I'm not complaining, I'm just curious.In summary the E900 is, or was, very impressive for the price. It feels flimsy and you'll never have people cooing at it, asking you to let them have a go, but it does the job for snapshots especially if you shoot RAW. The two big problems for me are the lens, and the odd 1/4 second exposure limitation. Given that digital cameras have come down in price over the last year it might be better to get an equivalent Powershot, even if it has a lower resolution. I find that nine megapixels seems like overkill, and I end up cropping most of my pictures and then sizing them down anyway. In theory I could make big prints, but I wouldn't with this camera because of the purple fringing and unpleasant noise reduction.As a footnote, there's an extension mount and a pair of accessory lenses. The mount feels flimsy and wobbles. The telephoto lens is limited by the shutter speed limitation as above - and it's not very telephoto. The wideangle lens is silly but fun. It's totally impractical, large and heavy, and unbalances the camera, and the images are even more distorted than usual, but it attracts attention. It's not a fisheye though. You can theoretically attach filters and so forth to the extension mount, if you have a 43mm filter or adapter.

I have had the Fuji Finepix F150, 5 meg pixel camera, it took very dark pictures! Even with flash, I tired to correct using different exposure settings with no avail! You can see by the example pictures taken by this Finepix E900 they are not colorful, lack of detail, all sightly out of focus and dark outside too. The only difference between the two cameras is the 9 mega pixel...it might as well be 100 mega pixel for a camera that is under standard to Nikon or Canon at about 6 mega pixels. Beware of this camera if you want good quality in focus, great color pictures! I do suggest the Canon line, SD 630 or 600  for about $200 to $250. you will not be disappointed... judge by the pictures ordinary people take! Don't be fooled by other reviews.. seeing is believing!", "Date": "December 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Arrived Broken", "Author": "D.
