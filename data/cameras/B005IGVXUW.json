{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good enough.", "Author": "inabon", "ReviewID": "RT5FP20VYEV05", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Background: Hobbyist photographer, other cameras are a Nikon D300 and a Nikon D40 with a plethora of lenses. Main purpose for buying this P&S; is for lightweight travel and taking it to restaurants, etc w/o the bulkiness of a DSLR, and a camera that I could hand to someone else to take a photo of me + family, you cant do that with a DSLR.I took this camera on a 10 day road trip to Disneyland and San Diego, I took several hundreds pictures with it and something like 30 videos so my review is based on this experience.Pros:- size. its small enough to carry with you yet beefy enough to use with big hands, as far as P&S; go, this is a great size, in comparison, the new Canons are just too small for big hands.- fast autofocus (instant when outdoors).- scenes work (but read cons).- battery life for photo taking is not horrible.Cons:- absolutely horrible battery life when taking video. If you take three five minute videos, prepare to not have a full day of battery, taking video EATS the battery.- scene mode: They take too long to select and you cant change the ISO on them, which means you'll get grainy pictures.- flash: it really is too underpowered, you cant take a family photo 4 feet from the camera at night, true, you can fix it later, but, still, flash could be WAY better.- 16M photo size: When using this size, the write speed to the card is horrendous, almost unusable for some of us (even with top of the line sd cards), my recommendation, use the 12M setting, the size is big enough for big prints and you get good write speeds.- charging trough USB. I prefer taking out a battery than removing a rubber gasket to connect a usb cable., however, it charges pretty fast.- odd focusing; I don't know if this is an issue with MY camera, but mine back focuses too much, (back focusing refers to: you focus on someone's faces, the focus point shows where it focused but then the focus point on the photo is actually behind the point you wanted, making the photo unusable)- lack of photo info: when taking a photo, it doesnt show you what ISO was used when using Scenes, which means you have to zoom into the pic to see if its usable, this is a big flaw in my opinion.Conclusion:- This is not a P7100 or a Canon G12, this is a basic P&S; that does one thing good, be basic (and the price proves it). Do not expect to be blown away by the quality of the pictures unless you took them outdoors and forced the ISO to be 200 or below, everything else will be good enough pictures. Would I recommend it? I guess I will with the caveats I mentioned, with the case logic travel case you can put it on your belt and have it with you all the time, thats a big bonus. Case Logic TBC-302 Ultra Compact Camera Case with Storage (Black)UPDATE: Tips & Tricks:- Two scenes work really good: Night Landscape & Sports (outdoors), the rest, not so much.- Change the photo size to 12M, it gives you a 4000 x 3000 sized picture, enough for most size prints, and the camera feels way faster with that setting on.- ISO 200 is really clean, if you can, leave it there, ISO 400 is not as good.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very nice basic P&S; camera", "Author": "DrBob", "ReviewID": "R168HSDL2LC7J4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera satisfies all of the criteria that might be applied to a small, versatile and relatively inexpensive point and shoot camera.> excellent exposure under most conditions, color balance very good> works well in low light without flash> fast focus, reasonably quick recycle time> excellent menu, limited of course by lack of manual controls> excellent battery life> nice wide angle lens with good zoom range, useful for both party and travel scenarios.Suggest purchase of external charger and second battery since included charger only works with the battery in the camera.I am very happy with this camera.

The pictures are vibrant in color and are amazing in quality.  The zoom works well and I was amazed at the way I could include a large area and group in one scene and it still have such good detail quality.  It does have a slight hesitation before the picture actually snaps which caused me to miss some great shots of my little grandchild, but I'm still learning how to use it.  Overall, I love the compact size of the camera, and the quality of the pictures, and am sure I will love it even more as I learn how to use it better.

I received this camera as a gift, and have been testing it all day. I wanted a new camera with a better zoom than my Elph, which is now around 5 years old. At this point, I do not perceive a major difference.* I keep recording video accidentally due to the button's location in the upper right corner of the back of the camera, where I often place a finger to stabilize things. This is a major problem.* There's a slight delay between the time you press the button and the time the photo is actually taken, another major problem if kids or animals are your subjects. I'd be more positive about this if the reason for the delay was better focus but...* The focus in general seems tricky, and no more reliable than my old Elph.* The zoom is stronger, but once again, focus is a problem.* The \"night\" camera option is not much better than my Elph's regular abilities.* The camera's beeps are loud - everyone around you will know when you turn it on and when you delete photos.* Which reminds me, the on button is very small! Not sure how this would work for someone with big hands.* Definitely purchase a second charger and battery. Otherwise, you'll need to plug in the camera like you plug in your phone.* The camera itself is rather large, as large as my old camera, which makes sense given the longer lens, except that longer lens does not seem to produce better results. Will not save space in my purse.At this point, I kind of get the feeling that the new camera has a lot of bells and whistles (the sepia option is one thing I really like), but is not much better in performance than my old camera. It may be that if you are looking for a better camera, you need to consider an SLR. Or it may be that this was meant for folks who don't already own an Elph or something comparable.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "just turn on and shooooot", "Author": "bassele", "ReviewID": "R2P3MDQ3P9YL1W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was skeptical about the coolpix for a while. After a little research I decided to get one, my first nikon camera after the canon. The camera is great and takes beautiful sharp pics with ease of use.

I highly recommend.

I wasn't happy with the quality of my last Kodak camera and wanted to replace it with something that would take better photos, especially in low-light or indoors with flash. I compared this camera to the Canon Elph 500 and ended up choosing this one because it felt better in my hand and the settings felt more intuitive. Plus, I was curious to see how Nikon would compare to my previous Canon point-and-shoot.This camera works wonderfully in most settings. It is definitely easy to use and the menus feel very intuitive to me. It's easy to change scenes or use different flash settings. I have not used it to take video, so can't comment at all on that functionality.The only times that I've run into any problems are in very low-light situations, especially if trying to take a photo from some distance away - the flash doesn't reach more than a few feet, resulting in photos that are very grainy and dark. Also, every so often the camera won't focus on the specific thing that I'm aiming at, making it necessary to make sure that I'm taking at least a few shots of anything that I want to make sure to capture. Honestly, that's something I would do normally anyway, just to ensure I don't miss a critical shot though.For most purposes (mine are taking family photos indoors or on-the-go) this camera works perfectly well and I'm very happy with the purchase.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent Cheap Camera, Lousy For A Nikon", "Author": "Imran Anwar", "ReviewID": "R2TQC803141Q9O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I love the pictures Nikon cameras take (see flickr /imrananwar for some examples) but each of my Nikon S6, 5700 and D300 ended up having to go back to repair manufacturing or design flaws. Cannot stand the 100% failure/defect ratio of a fancy expensive company like Nikon.I did not buy this at Amazon (which has always been a great experience to shop from, but adding this review to help other buyers. This Coolpix 6200 was bought to replace the (repaired) but working S6 6MP and to supplement the times I cannot carry the D300, and where the otherwise excellent for day time shots iPhone 4S 8MP camera would not excel, e.g. where real zoom helps (sunsets), large group photo with a flash), etc.First off, this Nikon (Coolpix 6200 being sold in) 2012 camera may as well have a built-in floppy drive. That is how long it takes to save a photo. Literally 5-6 seconds PER photo. Forget quick shots of some cute action like kids or animals (yes, some people's kids behave like animals, but that is a whole other review LOL). It has fair but paltry 720p video capability where the iPhone 4S has 1080 and quite good.The flash is not very powerful. The best thing about it is its red color :) . And the fact that it has a real zoom lens. I only bought it because I had a $25 reward/rebate from Staples, on top of it's price of $149 that day. So, for $125 (which was less than the cost of ordering some flimsy and hard to carry iPhone 4S zoom lenses, etc.) I got a real 3rd camera, and won't stop you from buying it for such use. As a primary camera, spend your money on a camera that actually has moved up to data writing speeds for this century.The overall colors of the photos are not bad, and better than the S6 in some situations. However, it has a truly poorly designed little plastic tab covering the USB port, which requires multiple nail insertions to pop, and always at the guaranteed risk of breaking off. It is almost like Nikon hired someone to design something as poorly as possible for such a basic thing. Also, on more than one occasion the camera will scare you by not displaying the images it took and saying that the card in it it unreadable. The card works fine in this and the other cameras it was tested in.So, get it at cheapest cost as a supplemental camera, but NOT as a primary camera. Click Yes if you find this review helpful.

Panasonic DMC-FH25A2.  Nikon Coolpix S62003.  Canon PowerShot SX230HS4.  Canon PowerShot SD980IS5.  Canon PowerShot Elph 100 HSThey all got returned.  I finally found the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX7V and I am THRILLED with it.  I never would have thought that a Sony camera would outperform comperable models from Nikon and Canon (WHAT has happened to Canon in the last few years?), but the difference is absolutely night and day.Conclusion: pass on this one and look at the Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX7V.

I have a Nikon D90 and it's wonderful, however, I always use a compact camera for ease in traveling local and away.  The pictures are distorted like they were taken in a fun house.  By the time you take the picture, either the person taking the picture has moved the camera or the subject has moved, thereby creating a blurry picture in either event.  The lag time is lengthy and there's no way to correct that setting.  Steer clear of this camera.

I think now they went up. Please check there first, before buying yours!  You have to keep checking for bargains.  Anyway, I love the way it looks and how it feels in the hand! It feels like it has a strong build, so I hope it doesn't ding or dent easy. I suggest to keep in a case, if you keep it in your purse.  Maybe even wrap it up in a soft no lint cloth.  My  Coolpix S8000 dents in easy.  Only had one dent...by the pop up flash..but I fixed it myself and it's fine.  Worse place to have a dent..by a pop up flash..anyway.. back to the S6200..the front of the body has a matte finish and the camera I bought is black..so it looks nice.  I don't know about you, but I don't care for all the other colos.  I stick with black.  Looks more adult / professional. I do, however own a red Olympus water resistant fun camera...and a red JVC camcorder..a tiny one.  Ok..back to the S6200 again..LOL.  I seem to like the photo quality so far and I love the color select filter....leaving out all the colors except the one you want.  Great quick video record button on the back and the scroll wheel is great.  The battery seems to get used up quickly but I read that it's from heavy use of the video and I did use the video a bit. So, buy a spare one! They take a EN-EL12 sized battery.  I guess this is a power house of a camera, but it does a lot of nice things.  I do recommend the Coolpix S6200 to you...it's more affordable than the other coolpixes in the 8000 and 9000 range of numbers.  Some don't like this camera...but most do..and I am one that does!  As picky as I am, I am very pleased..so far!  Only had it a few days...It's not as long as the Coolpix S8000...by a half inch..I like that. Great zoom.  Takes a decent still photos with minimum shake.  Still working or figuring out the best setting for low light...finding the best mode for indoor low light.

GOD FORBID your subject is moving even slightly when you are trying to photograph lets say... anything, you will get a blurry image AND have to wait about 5 seconds for the camera to \"record\" .. so if you're trying to take a picture of an animal, if you don't get the shot on the first try, forget it, by the time the camera goes back to normal that thing will be gone. I can't wait to return this thing.

With enough light, pictures and videos look amazing. It's not too good at night and the zooming for video is annoying just like most cameras like this. Battery life is amazing, just turn it off when you're not using it. Honestly. You can make the battery last for days. It turns on super fast so it's worth turning it off even if you're going to use it again after 1 minute. It's auto settings are really good. Manual settings are too slow to change but the auto is so great you might as well leave it there. The 16mp on this is really good. Again, with enough lights in the shot, you're able to zoom in quite a lot into the picture and it will still be really clear and nice. Exposure compensation is freaking amazing and fast to change. I mostly use this camera for videos and the 720p settings on it are great. I wish it would record at 60fps (Would have made the video muuuch better) but hey, for $180 you can't expect a gopro. For the head mount that I used in the video, it's just some scrap metal I taped together and put on a hat (Go Ghetto HD) lol. Super light camera, I take it everywhere and always carry it to school. Definitely worth the price.

When it does eventually focus, the slightest sideways movement of one person simply restarts the process! Considering that there is no manual focus, the camera is therefore useless.

I was in the market for a new camera as I was going to see KISS on 8/29/2012 and wanted decent photos. My current camera was a Samsung with a 3x zoom and took poor quality photos at the last concert I went to (Bret Michaels). So I thought this camera would be better. I was standing about maybe no more than 30 feet away from the stage. So I thought a 10x zoom would be best (or at least better than a 3x zoom).I did not change any settings before going to the concert. And it took decent photos from where I was sitting. Sometimes if I went more than the 10x zoom the pictures got really blurry. It did take a few seconds for the camera to start up and I had to hold down the power button to get it to even turn on. Instead of just clicking it quickly to turn on like my Samsung. The video mode was great. I got some really good shots of the band (Gene's fire breathing, Paul's flying over the crowd, the finale, the opener, etc.). But it wasn't the best quality. If I zoomed in all the way to the 10x zoom the picture got really blurry and you couldn't see anything. So I couldn't really zoom in very far.I took about 5 total videos and 30 photos throughout the day (not leaving the camera on the entire time) KISS was playing with Motley Crue and the total concert went for about 4 hrs. And my battery was about half way down from it's full charge when I got home. The photos at night turned out great after I tweaked them at home. I used the flash the entire time and it really dimmed out the bright lights around the band for good shots. But still some of them turned out blurry or too bright.The photos themselves turned out great, that means the ones that I didn't zoom into too far. But still great shots, though the band members still look a bit tiny. The videos turned out a little weird. Some shots were perfect. Like when Paul flew into the crowd he was about maybe no more than 15 feet from me and that video was good. But maybe it was just the bright lights. But some of the shots made the band look like the bright white lights. But I'm guessing that was lights. But still decent quality videos for night shots.All in all a good decent quality and much better than my 3x zoom Samsung for concert photos. I will probably still use this for future concerts (go to quite a few of them).

All the ease of a PowerShot, but the zoom and some of the features of a \"fancier\" camera.  After a while of lugging it around, however, I realized that I still needed a camera I could throw in my purse or backpack for long hikes or nights out on the town.  A Canon loyalist, I perused the selection and was disappointed to find that Canon didn't offer a cheaper, pocket-sized camera with at least 10x zoom and reasonable battery life.  (The main sticking point was the battery life.)  So, having heard plenty of people rave about the Nikon Coolpix series (and figuring that Nikon vs. Canon is like Ford vs. Chevy - different in their own ways, but both perfectly good), I took a leap of faith.  Nikon had come out with the Coolpix S6300 by that point, and the folks at Best Buy said that the only significant difference was the video quality.  The S6200 was cheaper and I didn't care about video, so I bought one.I MISS CANON!!!  Maybe my S6200 is a fluke, but the reliability / ease of use leaves a lot to be desired.  I'm not even an intermediate photographer, so I can't speak to image quality (they look pretty good to me, for the most part), but just TAKING the picture is a problem.My complaints:1.) It seems like you have to hit every button twice.  Twice to turn the power on, twice to get the zoom function to \"realize\" you want to zoom, twice to use the scene selector, etc.2.) The actual \"take the flippin' picture, already\" button is not responsive.  Many digital cameras have a bit of a delay, I realize that.  But this is AWFUL.  It's like the camera can't figure out what to do.  I've pressed the button, pressed the button and held it for 10 seconds, pressed it twice, pressed it three times...depending on the situation, sometimes it takes the picture, sometimes it waits 5 seconds, and sometimes it never goes.  This happens in auto mode as well as the scene selector modes.3.) Half the reason I chose this camera was for the scene selector mode.  My old Canon had a similar function that resulted in some great pictures.  With the S6200, some of the scene modes work better than others, but the sports mode does not work at all.  I'm not really sure what the intent of sports mode is, if not to \"freeze\" motion in a picture.  I've used it a number of times in a variety of light conditions, and the image is blurry every time.In short, I'm sure Nikon makes great cameras - just maybe not this series.

My last one, SD800IS Elph, finally quit working after years of reliable results - and I take a lot of pictures.  I also have a Canon SLR, but my pocket camera covers FAR more ground when I'm on the go.  The SLR is great for creative photo shots when I plan ahead for special events, but nothing beats a good reliable point and shoot pocket camera to have with you when lugging an SLR isn't practical and you still want to capture the moment.  So, when my 800IS camera went out, I naturally looked for a Canon replacement.  Long story short, all indications are that Canon has really let the quality of their Elph series slip significantly in recent years since my last purchase.  So, I opened my search up to Nikon pocket cameras.  While all cameras have their detractors, you have to look at the overall context of the various reviews.  After reading a lot of reviews, I eventually talked to a guy at a camera shop (that carries both Nikon and Canon cameras) and he recommended this model.  So, when I saw it on sale at Amazon a couple months back, I jumped on it.This camera is almost identical in size as my former Canon SD800IS.  The optical zoom on the Nikon is very good (much better than the my Canon), and I like to use a lot of optical zoom (avoiding digital zoom).  The photo quality also seems to be good.  Also, the features of the Nikon are also fairly easy to use (however, the manufacturers are now focusing on adding too many features 98% of point and shoot owners will never use, rather than keeping focus on improved image quality).The one thing I can't get past with this Nikon is the location of the Video Record button.  Nikon placed it right where you naturally grab the camera with your right-hand thumb.  You can't avoid but push the button with your thumb when you pick up the camera to take a shot - there is no other place to put your thumb to grasp the camera!  I remembered seeing another reviewer complain about this, but thought it couldn't be a show-stopper since not everyone was complaining.  Even with the raised edges next to the button, I haven't been able to avoid pressing it, whereby missing my shot as I figure out what I did and to turn off recording before I can shoot.I have no idea why Nikon would place the video record button in that location!  I want a snapshot camera, not a video camera!  Shooting video from a pocket camera is a very small percentage of what I want a snapshot camera for.  I just want a great photo (in both bright and dim light), with basic features to help me get that shot (not the kitchen sink), which are accessible and easy to use, such as force flash on or off, zoom.I'm hoping I can adjust and get used to the placement of the record button so I can avoid pressing it all the time.  Given my track record thus far, I'm not hopeful.  I'm also considering putting a small piece of tape over the button to help me 'feel' the button and not press it!If you buy this, good luck!", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor Quality Camera", "Author": "Mamma Lu \"Mamma Lu\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZA3APUKBJHV7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Due to the poor picture quality of this camera, I returned it to Amazon as I was worried it was defective.
