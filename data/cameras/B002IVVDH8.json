I get great results from it, but it can't shoot video or fit in my pocket.I picked up one of these Kodak jobs and was pleased.  It had a really good macro, shoots nice video, and has all the stuff I need except for an SD card.  You will have to buy one since the camera has limited memory.  But it can take up to a 32 gig card.  Amazing.  The battery seems to have lots of juice too, which is always a problem for small compact cameras.  The colors from the software are good.

For the first month, it was an awesome camera. The pictures were great the features were fun and easy to work with.  But suddenly, for no apparent reason, the focus was off for the wide angle zoom. I reset the camera like the book suggested, and still had the same problem. This was purchased through Amazon, so I thought I might send it back. Their return date was 2 days prior.  I contacted Kodak, and they could fix the issue, for about $130 plus shipping both ways. This for a camera I paid less than $100 for.  I would not recommend this camera for anyone.

The picture quality is amazing, up close photos turn out crisp and clear. Smart Capture setting auto adjusts photo lighting, exposure etc. to give you the most clear photos for your surroundings automatically! This camera is super easy to use even the manual is easy to use, 5-7 pages of everything you need to know about this camera with troubleshooting pages/tips at the end. An in camera HELP button also makes using this camera easy! The camera has the LI ION battery which makes the camera A LOT lighter, you really notice how bulky and heavy a double AA battery camera is once you start using this one, not only does it relieve the weight but not having to change batteries every so often while shooting pics at an event or parade and missing that one great shot is awesome. The battery that came with it has yet to die on me yet but I am going to go ahead and buy another just in case, just found one only $13 brand new!

It is very easy to use and with 12.2 MP to just go wild with, you can take some really killer pictures with it! The only thing I find wierd is that it doesn't come with a memory card... You have to buy one separately like I did (I just found it out when I got the camera about a week ago) :(  The camera has an internal memory card built in, but it doesn't really hold a lot... (Only 10 pictures and 29 seconds of video.) Pretty much just a sample of what it can do. If you want to buy this camera, (and I recommend you do because it's Kodak) then do remember to buy a memory card while you buy the camera because then you don't have to make the mistake that I did and wait for another week or 2 to get it, Just warning you  :)PS.

I am a professional photographer, so i am used to having a huge camera and lenses all the time, but for the trip i needed a compact lightweight point and shoot. The photos i took with it turned out amazing! They are sharp, detailed, and the color pops nicely with little to no post manipulation. The battery lasts for quite a long time. The menus and controls take some getting accustomed to, but once you figure it out, it's simple. It only weighs 4.1oz, so it was the best choice for a backpacking trip. Although it may not be recommended, i used my ipod charger wall-plug-in-thingy to charge it, so i only needed the camera's supplied usb cable in my backpack with the ipod stuff (which is also a cool feature - you can charge it with a computer's usb powered bus). The first one that i got was not from amazon, and i got a free extra battery with the camera (but at the time it cost more), but i don't think i ever had to switch. The panorama stitching in the camera is very smart, but hard to line up sometimes (in the bright california desert). I must also say that recently i got a fish tank, and i've been trying to take pictures of them with no good luck, but i can't get them to hold still enough for my D80 either, but at least i can get a focus... the kodak has trouble focusing on the correct fish in the tank and there is no way to manually control it. Another note - probably the video on this camera is not so great, but at least it does not eat up a lot of card space, and it would end up on youtube anyways! I gave the silver hiking trip camera to my girlfriend for her birthday and bought a second one of these in black just to make sure i got another one before they discontinue the model. She has fun with hers taking photos of her cat and pretty sunsets and her friends. This review is mostly on outdoor photos, i barely used the flash, so i am not sure if there are bad red-eye problems or harsh flash issues, but it's $89, and you get more than you pay for. This is my favorite camera for the price. here are some photos that i took with it in california: [\u2026]", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Photo Quality... but no HD Video", "Author": "K.

I almost always leave positive feedback for any products we use and are happy with. However, I do feel it's important for others to be aware of possible issues.After having great success with a Kodak Easyshare camera in the past, when my son put a camera on his wish list for Christmas 2009, we decided to go with this camera. Less than 10 months later in September 2010, it suddenly stopped working completely. We were shocked since we had positive experience with Kodak in the past. Still under warranty, we shipped it in for repair. Then, we were told that the camera had rust AND corrosion on the inside and the warranty was voided. So, in order to have the repair completed we'd have to pay $79.95 in addition to the $8 shipping it to them we'd already paid. Since we've had the camera, it has NEVER come into contact with any liquid whatsoever. Even if it had, there is no way it would have rusted and corroded to this extent since we've had it. After several emails, and a phone call (25 minutes on hold) to Customer Service, I was told that there was no option. We'd have to pay for the repair. We have decided to cut our losses and just purchase a new camera. This time we're going with a Sony for our son since we have several other Sony products including two digital cameras and they always stand behind their products.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "cheap, and it kinda shows...", "Author": "John Beowulf \"beowulfborealis\"", "ReviewID": "R18CR90GZ3IFBD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this thing and headed to the tropics for a while.

It starts up quick and has a decent lag time between shots.  Given the $100 price tag, I really shouldn't have any complaints.  Regardless, the 'clicking noises' caused by the camera's auto focus constantly adjusting the position of the stepper motor that drives the lens is annoying.  Annoying to the point that I wish I'd spent twice as much on different camera that had similar photo quality.  One of my friends has a Canon A1100 that has similar performance but is quiet as a mouse.  With the number of micro steps the auto focus directs the stepper motor to take, I'd be surprised if this camera lasts more than two years.", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Amy M.

Since that was what I was looking for at home I knew Easyshare would be my choice.  This model is even more intuitive than the one I have at work, like recognizing that when I've inserted a memory card that I want the camera to use it, rather than having to program it that way.  This, of course, is necessary as the internal memory is incredibly limited.  The battery life if amazing.  I love that the internal battery makes it really lightweight and it lasts for a long, long time.  I've taken oodles of pics and about 5 different 2-3 minute videos and I still have about 70% of the battery available. The picture quality is great- it snaps quickly and action shots turn out awesome.  It has performed well in different types of light, including bright sunlight and darkened rooms.  I am not a serious photographer by any means, but it does everything I need it to do and more.  I am also happy with the video quality.In short, I love this easy to use camera and feel like it is a great quality camera for the price.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodak Easyshare M341 Digital Camera", "Author": "David Spangler \"smilin_dave\"", "ReviewID": "RJFZNRIAFFEML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First bought this camera to replace my wife's stolen camera.

That was enough for me. It has a lot of features. It does make a clicking noise haha it's not broken. But I like the camera a lot compared to my old Kodak camera that had 3 features although the macro was awesome. I really like this camera, I would suggest it's for someone who wants it for leisure purposes than professional use. There's a panorama option too which I haven't learned how to use and I'm one of the type of people who are too lazy to read the manual so I'm figuring it out slowly. Also to power the camera it comes with a usb inserter (2 in 1), so it's great, you get your usb for the computer and your charger :) It's easy to use. And the screen is very large, even people I know who are elderly can see everything on this screen so woot! :) I think it's a pretty good camera. I didn't give it full stars only because I'm still getting to know it and I haven't found something that really makes me go: OMGGG no other camera has this option! THIS IS AWESOME. lol. But it's a good camera. I'd keep it in a case or something after you buy because I think it could break the screen. So that's my little suggestion. :)", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Don't Waste Your Money!", "Author": "April Watkins-bravo \"Super Mommi\"", "ReviewID": "RYEKG4BANO1QU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is a waste of money!

You can turn flash on and off, you can take video (and zoom in while taking the video), and viewing photos is simple--you can even adjust the volume while watching videos (some cameras don't).This is a nice camera for the photographer on the go, or a first camera for a tween/teenager.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's a great camera", "Author": "Felicia", "ReviewID": "REA7ZOQ94JM0H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my camera.

Nix", "ReviewID": "RYT6TRC9Z9LHC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera at a great sale and was fairly pleased with it straight out of the box. This was my second EasyShare, so navigating the menu was simple. It took nice shots in brightly-lit situations, but indoor shots at my daughters' basketball games were always dark and grainy. The battery life was good for a pocket camera, but the 3x optical zoom left a lot to be desired. It is noisy and makes a lot of whirring and clicking when it tries to autofocus, but I've since read there's way to stop that.A week ago I was working on transferring pictures (via the USB cable connection)from my SD card to my hard drive when my daughter did something that required me to grab the camera to take a few pictures. I took two pictures and turned the camera off. A couple of minutes later I wanted to take another picture, so I turned the camera on again. The light flashed on for a second, and the lens extended, but the screen remained blank. No amount of button-pushing would get the screen to come back up. After about a minute the lens retracted. I tried starting the camera again to the same results.Getting worried at this point, I plugged the camera back into my computer, but it wouldn't communicate with my computer. The computer didn't even show that there was a device connected. Then came the true kiss of death for the M341. I pulled out the SD card and popped it into the slot on the front of my computer. Rather than trying to bring up the pictures, my computer will only try to format the disk, which means that the camera erased those pictures and the SD card is blank. I lost several irreplaceable images on there, such as my youngest daughter's first day of kindergarten. I lost probably 6 months worth of pictures.This was not a case of operator error. I looked at the number of pictures available when I turned on the camera the first time, and the card was about half full, so they were still there at the time it started malfunctioning.I've since messed around with it a little more and found that the camera will work without an SD card, which is very impractical since you can only get 10 pictures at its highest setting. Still, I may let my daughter play with it.I've now purchased a Sony Cybershot DSC-H55 and am very pleased with what I've seen so far.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good camera-- minus the sand", "Author": "Kittia \"Kittia\"", "ReviewID": "R1UZPMIKQ1RTNQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My dad got me this camera on clearance last summer after my older kodak started not being reliable (after 3 years of good use).I had this camera for a few months and then took it to the beach at the beginning of the school year..

I thought it was just the battery, so I charged it and it still didn't work-- I would power it on and the lens would start to come out but it got stuck and went back in.Fortunately, I got a hold of kodak and sent it in and they repaired it and I got many more months of use from it. Unfortunately, the same exact thing happened to it exactly a year later. I took it to the beach (and didn't even take it out of my purse this time), and it was not working by the time I got home.
