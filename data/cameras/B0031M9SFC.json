I had an extremely long run with no power available locally and this solved the issue. Great picture quality and no interference.

Both of them worked great when I first installed them.  After about a month for each of them, they both stopped working.  One of the cables doesn't provide electrical power to the camera now, and the other one gets power but does not carry the video.  A great buy for the month it worked.  Not sure why they both stopped working.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good shielded RG-59 coax with 2C #18 power wires.", "Author": "David Johnson", "ReviewID": "R233F136PQVVD6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good cable, well constructed. Even though the photo shows a single cable it really is a siamese cable with RG-59 coax and a 2C #18 power cable. As a bonus it even came with a BNC coupling.It's shielded so the signal won't degrade over long distances, and it will shield against interference better.", "Date": "May 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Good", "Author": "Tony", "ReviewID": "R171JNN8SKL1VF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall this wire is great but when I ordered it I did not get working wire.

In some cases, I needed to run lines over 100 feet. I tried other cables I seemed to get some distortion. But not with these. even at 200',  I cannot tell the difference between this line/camera verse only 10' cable run lines.  The clarity on my monitors (both locally and remotely over the internet) look the same. The price is definitely fair. I have since purchased 12 of these 200' Q-See cables and have not had a problem with a single one of them.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Product/Excellent Price/Excellent Service", "Author": "BO", "ReviewID": "R3K09DH9DRQ0TM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The title says it all. The cable was delivered within a week and came exactly as described. All related parts were included and it was completely compatible with my Q-See surveillance system being installed at the same time. It was priced on Amazon far lower than the retail price for the same product on the Q-See.com website and, because I ordered several cables of shorter length at the same time; delivery was free at the time of purchase.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Q-See 200 Ft with Connectors", "Author": "Jeffrey A.

The sheathing is thick & the connectors are heavy & well molded onto the ends.  They're not likely to pull off in any type of normal use.  I currently have 8 of the 200' cables & 3 of the 100' cables in use on my home security system.  I had some cheaper cables on some of my cameras but had ghosting problems with them.  These cables took care of that for good.  Amazon's price on the 200' cables is as good as anywhere else I've found.  I highly recommend them if you're looking for a quality cable & want to do it right the first time.  You won't be disappointed.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kool Kat", "Author": "Kathy Lynn Hines \"Kool Kat\"", "ReviewID": "R3U72QL9LKQORU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a camera at back of my shed without trying to add cable after cable.This does the job.Works great.Has all the hook ups for the Q see cameras.It is heavy duty and will work with the weather.I am very happy they finally made a cable like this.I don't get the wireless cameras because too many people wrote how they interfere with the router(wifi).Love the cable.Highly recommend this cable for a long reach.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$68.99", "Features": "Shielded 200 Ft.
