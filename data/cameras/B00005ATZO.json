The A20 fits the bill.  The colors on the A20 are great.  They are more saturated and a lot more accurate than the Elph.  I will no longer have to go in and filter out any blue casting.Low light capabilities are better than the Elph with the exception of focus.  The A20 automatically adjusts to ISO 150 in low-light which is something I don't think the S100 did.  I notice the background in regular and slow-sync to show much more detail at night on the A20.  I have however noticed less accurate focusing in low-light than the Elph.  Pictures also tend to be a little grainier at times perhaps due to the higher ISO in low-light.The battery life is great.  I am using the AA batteries supplied with the camera and I have taken over 150 shots and used the LCD half of the time and I still have not received a battery warning.  The batteries however are listed as \"Industrial\" Alkaline which may mean they have a much longer life than regular AA batteries.I do miss the size of the Elph, the fact it looked just like a regular Elph2 camera, the rugged metal body, the anti-glare film on the LCD (the A20 has none), and the slick look of it.  However, the A20 produces better pictures, has a much better underwater case (goes to a depth of about 100ft), and will last much longer on four AA batteries than the Elph did on its ... proprietary battery.  Of course, for a smaller camera there is always the S300 however it still uses the proprietary battery and is ... more.  Plus, it is still bigger than the S100 was.  The image quality of the S300 however should be the same as the A20 except that the S300 will focus better in low-light due to a better focus-assist lamp.", "Date": "April 26, 2001"}, {"Title": "Overall SUPER....with a couple minor quirks", "Author": "newly preggo", "ReviewID": "R1HESUJ0NDEED3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a point and shoot camera to take on vacation, that was convenient and takes good quality pix--for both digital use and to print snapshots. The cannon A20 Delivers! Effortless picture taking, sharp quality pix, good colors and a flash that doesn't wash you out. I tested it out at my friends wedding earlier this month....Now the caveats:1. Factor in the cost of a 128mb memory card. That will take approx 128 pix on the highest setting 1600x1200 at superfine compression. I've found that this setting gives you nice 4x6 prints comparable to a film camera. ...2. Battery life: the change battery signal will come up very quickly if using the display. However, THIS SEEMS TO BE MERELY A WARNING--DO NOT CHANGE THE BATTERIES. I've been able to power up again and again after the warning and take the rest of my pix on the memory card.  I also invested in a 5hr nimh quick charger with a spare set of 4 AA batteries ....(NOTE:camera will NOT take those lithium batteries, I called cannon and confirmed this)3. When taking pictures, be very careful of camera shake. This camera is very sensative to this, especially if taking pix without flash in lower light conditions. Be careful or your picture will end up BLURRY. So take a deep breath, hold and snap! Ok, maybe holding your breath until you turn blue is a tad of an exaggeration--See what works for you. Most of my pix have turned out nice and sharp.4. Using the viewfinder only, without the LCD display will show you only about 2/3 of the final pic. (It ends up with space all around.)

I had mine for 1 week, and the pictures are better than one would expect from an entry level Digicam. I still can't believe this Cam can give me 7.5x pictures that are clear. Wow. But the 3x optical zoom is excellent by its own account. There are just a few minuses. I can't manually set the shutter speed. Though there's a slow sync option, you can't really see the difference. The film coating for the LCD screen is not the top notch anti-reflect kind Canon has on the S series, which can be a pain in the behind if you shoot under the sun like me. Aside from that, very good Digicam. But buying Digicam comes added cost... -1) Viking 128MB Compact Flash Card. You'll need this for sure. At 1600x1200 @ SuperFine, you'll 140 pictures.2) Lowepro D-Res 10 AW Digital Camera Bag. Got to trust me on this. Its the only bag you want your Digicam to be store in. Forget the overpriced Kodak and Canon bags, this baby has storage for 4 additional AAs, special pocket for additional Compact Flash Card, fits your Digicam like it's made to order, and enough cushion and padding to make throwing you Digicam out the window safe. Plus, there's a secret feature on the back if you get the chance to buy the bag.3) Kodak Photolife K1000 AA Battery Charging Kit. AA batteries are way better than proprietary Canon Lithium batteries on the S series Digicams. And with a charger that juices the included batteries up in 2.5 Hrs flat, you just can't go wrong. Did I mentioned Kodak 1600 mAh NiMH batteries last forever between charges?4) SanDisk Imagemate USB Compactflash Reader.

I went from a 35mm EOS to this and have not regretted it a bit.  One thing I didn't want was one of those digital cameras that say \"ooh look at me, I'm digital..\"  I prefer taking great pictures without drawing a lot of attention to myself-- more candid and natural looking photos that way. It is small lightweight and incognito.Before getting the camera I was concerned about image quality being up to snuff and with this camera it turns out not to be an issue.  I never use it at its highest quality setting and I can not tell the difference between my digital photos (even enlarged as 8x10s from ofoto.com) and my non-digital photos!  Any more than 2.1 mega-pixels would definitely be a waste of money-- both on the camera and on the memory required. Really, don't bother.The best and the worst thing about this camera are one in the same:  editing out unwanted photos on the fly.  How awesome is it to just trash the loser photos along the way so you only end up with all excellent photos?  That is probably why I'd say I take better pictures with this camera than I ever have before!  The downside is that it takes a few more button presses to delete that bad photo than I'd prefer.

She is a professional photographer and she has been interested in dabbling in digital photography. I didn't want to spend a lot of money just in case she was disappointed. We are also going to Europe shortly and I wanted a point and shoot camera that wasn't bulky and something that a novice, like myself, could use. At minimum, my wife wanted controls over exposure, white balance, and shutter speed.After months of research I was down to 3 cameras - the Canon S110, A20 and a Sony DSC-P50. Since they all have received very good reviews it was really down to ergonomics and personal preference. ... My wife loved the A20 because if had excellent ergonomics with a grip on the right side and room on the left side for you fingers. The layout of the buttons on the A20 was also straight forward (as were the S110). All cameras had a solid feel to all of them. Personally, I would have chosen the S110. I love the size of the camera. Overall a great camera that met my wifes expectations. We will be taking this camera to Europe and leaving the 35mm at home. Strengths:Ergonomics - the hand grip and locations of all the controls, lcd, and viewfinder remind my wife of a 35mm camera. The camera also has a build in lens cover when off. Size - not too small, not too big. It is smaller than our 35mm point-and-shoot camera.Photo Quality - excellent excellent excellent. The colors and sharpness are better than I ever expected. Prints come out wonderful. Features - for our purpose it has everything we need. It doesn't have a manual shutter control but that is ok. The auto shutter does a pretty good job. You can affect the shutter speed by placing the camera in manual mode and by using, or not using, the flash.  I also appreciate the camera not having a \"movie\" mode. That is what a camcorder is for. I've seen \"movies\" made with digital camcorders and i don't find them useful or even viewable. Shutter Lag or lack of - this puppy is quick. I pretty much treat this camera like a 35mm point and shoot. This is especially true when the shutter is pressed half way to first set the exposure and focus. Uses AA batteries - this is how it should be (I think the Sony also allows for Lithium batteries). If I need batteries in an emergency I know I can easily find them almost anywhere. I bought a great charger (Maha C204F) and 1800mAH batteries.Price - it can't be beat. Menu Layout - the menus are easy to follow and have a simple hierarchy. I hate having to got through layers of menus to get to where I wanted to go.Download speeds - very quick.Weaknesses:Compact Flash I only - doesn't allow the use of IBM's microdrive. However, a couple of 128MB CF cards have been more than enough for meFlash - it could be more powerful but that could probably be said with all cameras that I've looked at. LCD Screen - the size is fine but it is difficult to read in bright sunlight. I think the S110 has an advantage here.Bottom line ... if you want a great point & shoot camera at a low price then you can't go wrong with this.", "Date": "August 11, 2001"}, {"Title": "Good value, but distinct limitations", "Author": "Diane, genre fiction & wordplay lover \"diane_d\"", "ReviewID": "RB1WIYYVT5G0I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the price, this is a very good camera for the casual photographer who mainly wants point-and-shoot ease, with a few adjustable features, and a mid-range zoom (3X optical - avoid the digital except for previews!). It's about the same size as a basic 35mm film camera, and I like the hand-hold ridge (although I'm glad I'm not a lefty!). It takes very attractive, clear, and accurately-colored shots IF there is sufficient light (either ambient or within its flash range): everything from scenic panoramas - the included software is easy and produces nice results on the computer - to macro-mode closeups (I recommend pulling back a couple inches, and using the zoom to narrow the view). HOWEVER, the flash range is naturally limited, and if there are deeply shadowed areas in the image, or not enough light in general for a wider-angle view, the picture comes out blotchy and grainy. The ISO comparison is only 100 up to about 150 with +2 exposure - I didn't realize just how limiting this would be when I purchased it.The other main drawback is shutter speed, or lack thereof. Every digital camera has lag between pressing the button and finishing the image file, but be aware that many things add more delay to its focus time and shutter release, too, e.g. automatic focus (which is always on, except for subsequent shots in panoramic stitch-assist and _?_); red-eye reduction flash (which uses a pre-flash red light); and any flash slows down subsequent shots, for recharge time. All this makes it harder to capture a quick moment with sports, kids, animals, special occasions, etc., especially during the period of learning its timing. The \"continuous shooting\" mode helps, when you know such a moment is immanent, but it's still slow, especially when you need the flash.My only problem with ease of use - the controls are mainly self-explanatory, and the manual clearly explains everything (even if it is rather scantily indexed) - is the \"half-depressed\" step of the shutter button, for getting the focus / focus-lock (signalled by the optional Beep) - I've had the camera for several \"rolls\"-worth of snapshots now and, too often, I still push the button all the way before I intend to.Also, remember: You'll need to buy AT LEAST 64 Mb total of CompactFlash memory, to avoid running out, and 2 sets (8) rechargable batteries to \"leapfrog\" in use. (Lithium ones aren't compatible, by the way.) A USB card reader is also worth getting, so you don't have to connect the camera every time - unless you have a printer with a built-in CF slot(?).Overall, if you mainly take still and/or scenic shots in good light, this is a nice, user-friendly, compact, relatively inexpensive option.Oh, by the way, don't bother buying the closeup add-on lens - if I can clearly photograph a pair of earrings and hardly need to crop the image, what more would anybody want?", "Date": "June 12, 2001"}, {"Title": "Winning Budget Digital Camera", "Author": "Henry S. Bailey", "ReviewID": "R1EAOZWTSTVSIR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looked for a digital camera primarily to use for emailing photos, taking photos to post to a web site, and for use in taking photos for online auctions.  The last thing I was thinking of when I purchased this camera was just how exceptional a job it does of taking excellent photos that can be printed out as 4x6 photos.  It does all of this better than I expected for the price.I had looked at the similar Sony, Olympus, Nikon, and even the Canon Elph cameras, but came away with this one.Aside from MPEGs, video or shots with sound, this camera does everything I have asked it to do.  The extra bells and whistles of some of the other models were not required for the applications I am using.The camera is small, very close to my compact 35mm camera, also very close in price.  It has a good feel to it.  It's built, as are all the Canons I am aware of with a plastic body.  It is certainly durable enough.  One comment left a star off because of durability.  My thought on that is try dropping any digital camera and see what's left of it.  The Canon A20 incorporates an excellent flash, simple straight forward menu...yes, you will have to read the manual...,excellent download time, bare minimum photo editing software, as most of the others do.  The viewfinder, again, as with other brands does not capture the full picture results, but that is a minor point.  It fits great in the hands and acts like some of the compact 35mm I have owned, except that it takes better photos than any of my 35mm cameras.  That was the surprise.  If you want a digital camera at what is very possibly the best price and value, and you want one for printing photos, general web usage, along with a Macro feature, and good zoom range, I have not seen a better camera.  While you cannot control the shutter speed on this model, it does take superior photos in low light conditions without using the flash.  This camera is sensitive, so...depending on what you plan to photograph and the conditions you will be taking pictures in, I recommend getting a decent tripod.While this camera does go through alkaline batteries very quickly, it certainly does not do so as fast as other models I have used, but you will want to get the NiMh batteries (two sets), along with the charger, also a larger memory card.  Toss in your choice of photo editing software and you are off to the races.  I have not used all of the cameras in the 2.1 megapixel range, but for the price, the funtions, and the quality of the photos, I don't think that for my use there would be any point to look further.

Plenty of advanced features should you decide to use them.  The included Photo Stitch software allows you to stitch multiple exposures into a panorama view.  Minor limitations: only supports USB downloads (no RS232 or firewire), all photos stored in JPEG format (does have choice of 3 compressions - normal, fine, superfine) and finally the zoom lacks fine control in that it always zooms further than I'd like.

I've formed these opinions:Pros: 1.  3X optical zoom lens with Canon lens quality.  2.  Excellent picture quality.  3.  Great full auto mode shooting. 4.  Nice variety of picture sizes and compression options. 5.  Able to take Macro close ups. 6.  Photo stitch several pictures together for a big panorama. 7.  Some manual features available such as forcing a flash or turning it off, and exposure compensation. 8.  Everything you need to get started except a computer is included.  9.  The camera is has a fairly speedy operation.  The time it takes to turn on and snap a pic is just 2 to 3 seconds.  Other operations are generally fast too. 10. Able to turn off LCD screen and greatly increase battery life.Cons: 1.  The 8MB Compact Flash that is included is ridiculously small for a 2.1 Megapixel camera.  You will spend extra money in buying a 32, 64, or 128MB Compact Flash module.  Factor that in to your overall cost. 2.  The LCD screen is tiny.  While you can get a good sense of how your photo will look, those little icons telling you things are tough to read unless you have the eyes of an eagle. 3.  The controls are not very intuitive.  You WILL need to read the manual that explains what they are and how to use them. 4.  The software included is the bare minimum needed to download and print your pics.  You will most certainly want to buy some supplementary software for editing, creating albums, etc.Contrary to what others say, battery life is acceptable.  ALL digital cameras with LCD screens drain batteries fast.  The A20 is no worse than the rest.  You may want to invest in some Ni-MH (nickel metal hydride) rechargeable batteries.  Radio Shack sells some with charger for around $22.Overall, I find the A20 a good point and shoot zoom digital camera.  Canon skimped some of the stuff that comes with the camera, but the camera itself is a fine product.  If you are like me, you will wind up buying a bigger Compact Flash Card, Ni-MH batteries, and some better photo editing software.

At first I was leaning toward an Olympus C-2040, but finances and a re-evaluation of my digital photography needs led me to the PowerShot A20.  I've been using it a lot in the two days since I got it, and it is a *very sweet* camera.  I barely had to look at the manual to get up and running with it, although the manual was helpful in explaining some of the more specialized features.  I plugged it into our TV, and not only can it display pictures from there, I can also use it as a monitor to take pictures! I installed the download software that comes with the camera, and was pleasantly surprised to discover that you have a choice in which image editing program you send the pictures to.  I am not usually a fan of bundled software, preferring to use Photoshop, but the PhotoStitch software that comes with the camera is really pretty good!  It allows you to stitch together images in several ways.  I was concerned when the pictures I took in PhotoStitch mode didn't seem like I had matched them correctly, but the software is incredibly intuitive.  I also like the rapid-fire shooting option.  I used it near the goal at a soccer match yesterday, and it helped me catch the moment when the goal attempt was made!  Later I just deleted whichever rapid-fire shots were blurry or didn't capture the action.  I can also send pictures from my computer to the storage disk on the camera, so if I wanted to create a slideshow to travel with I could!  Like I expected, it is a battery hog, but I bought myself a good rechargeable battery set with charger when I purchased the camera, and I'm going to buy another battery set this week so I can rotate them out for charging.  I also need to get a much larger CompactFlash disk.  I have two of the 8MB ones right now, which work fine for short trips, but it would be nice to just take photos for a while and not have to clear a few of them out for space periodically.Overall I am thrilled with the performance of this camera, and it looks like all my research paid off.

I like the 3X optical zoom on the camera, it gives me some choice on how to compose the pictures.  The colors from this camera are amazing, very lifelike.  The camera saves all the images as JPG's (in one of three levels of compression).  The JPG's have been easy to email, the files are not too large.  The flash provides good coverage indoors, but I have not tried many shots more then about 10 feet.

I got a Powershot A50 about 2 years ago and absolutely loved it. When I had the opportunity to upgrade a few months ago, I was disappointed with the selection of 2.1MP cameras. I decided to wait on the upgrade and keep my A50 1.3MP. When the A20 came out, I had to have it! The thing that stands out most to me is the speed of this camera. It can take pictures much more rapidly than the A50. Playback occurs almost instantly and the USB interface is so much faster than serial.  Add great picture quality, decent battery life, and 3x optical zoom and you have a great camera.  Moreover, the A20 is the same price that my A50 was 2 years ago! Prices are going down!  The best feature with the Canons is the software. The ZoomBrowser is the best tool I have ever seen for managing images. I have around 2000 pictures stored in the ZoomBrowser from my old d-cam and I can see every picture on the screen at once! This makes it easy to find that great shot from 5 months ago. This software has biased me toward Canons for a good reason.  The A20's shortcomings include mediocre red-eye reduction, a small LCD, and occasional  focusing problems in the Macro mode. These are problems with most Point and Shoot d-cams.  I also miss the sleek metal casing featured by the A50. The A20 is plastic, but this does provide better ergonomics than the metal box of the A50.  The A20's accessory line includes an underwater case and auxiliary macro and tele lenses. I plan to buy these accessories as soon as I find them on the market. These features put this camera way above others at this price point. There are better d-cams than the A20, but their advantages are few and their prices are double.

I'm 80% happy with it.  The colors are good and sharp. I like the optical zoom though twisting the lens to zoom on a 35mm is easier.  I usually shoot on the highest resolution setting, then crop and resize images on the computer.  High and low light conditions can cause some color distortion.  The flash has been acceptable for most shots.  The A20 is a tad heavy due to the four AA batteries.  Ah, the batteries.  There is a flaw in the design of the A20 such that batteries can only be used until the voltage drops a tiny 0.2 volts.  The message to change batteries usually occurs after about 100 pictures but you can still use those batteries for 50-75 or more shots.  Even then the batteries have plenty of juice for a flashlight and most other applications.  Don't throw the batteries away when removed from the camera.  However, batteries are not a problem if you use rechargeables.  Buy a Quantray NiMH Overnight-Charger ($...) and maybe a second set of rechargeable batteries.  I just took 110 pictures in three weeks on one charge of the batteries.Another major fault of my camera is that the TV out does not always work.  I think it is affected by the batteries' condition but I have never proved that.  I could send it back for repair under warranty but I don't want to do without the camera for two months.A (mild) complaint is that the viewfinder does not show all that appears in the picture.  The viewfinder does show a zoomed image, more or less.And now a few words about the software.  It is useful for maintaining a database of photos but if you have a lot of pictures you must use it wisely or it can be real slow -- like 15 minutes to update the database.  For instance, don't add new photos to a folder that has hundreds of other photos.  Load the new photos into an empty folder, refresh that library, then drag them to the desired folder. The layout and printing tools have many good features but also have some annoying hindrances.  I have not found out how to make the default font for captions to be my desired (small) size instead of a large 20 pt size.  I use other software (LViewPro) for general picture editing.Get a 64mb (or more) memory card for the storage of 100 high resolution pictures.  Also get a LowePro case that fits the A20 snuggly and also holds extra memory cards and batteries.  I have the SanDisk Compact Flash card reader which allows transfers of hi-res pictures to the computer each in under a second.  I am glad the A20 makes images in JPG format but I wish there was a resolution setting between the medium and high res settings.", "Date": "March 2, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great from the start -", "Author": "John A.

They called and said they couldn't get it to interface with their computer and sent it to repair.  Repair sent it back to me (without contacting me first) and said it works fine and wouldn't be of further assistance.  Got my camera back...takes great pictures butI can't load them onto a computer.

I can't add much more to what has already been said here about the camera itself, regarding pros and cons. I must say, I haven't had any inclination to drag my APS Elph out with me so much, now that I have the A20. The A20 is bigger than both the digital and film versions of the Elph, but it really is light-weight thanks to the plastic case and really not that much harder to tote along than the Elph. And it's just hard to beat the instant gratification of digital photography, especially when the results are so pleasing. I think photo quality actually surpasses that of my APS film camera. I also got the 128 MB Viking compact flash card, and in fact will probably order another. I was also pleased with all of the software that came with the camera. Elsewhere, I've heard people put down the ZoomBrowser software, but I found it gets the job done very well and works well with my other software. As good as the camera itself is, what really sold me on the A20 camera was the fact you could get a reasonably-priced water-proof case for it. I did in fact buy the WP-DC200 case and it's awesome. I'm not really into underwater photography, but at least now I can take my A20 out in the snow or on the beach and have fun snapping away, knowing my investment is well-protected. The WP-DC200 permits you full access to all buttons and features. You can also fully extend the zoom lens within the waterproof case. There is an anti-reflective coating on the lens of the waterproof case, which is a must and a very welcome feature. The waterproof case does add some bulk, but no worse than the bulk of my 35 mm SLR. And its design echoes the comfortable ergonomics of the camera itself and is easy to grip, even with small hands. You do need a steady grip and a strong index finger, though, to depress the shutter button. It does take a small bit of practice to feel fully comfortable manipulating the A20's controls through the case. But after awhile it becomes second-nature. I'm also eager to buy some of the accessory lenses and possibly the card photo printer available for the A20. I think it's great that for a camera that is basically a point-and-shoot digicam, so many great accessories are available to extend the A20's versatility.", "Date": "August 26, 2001"}, {"Title": "Picture Quality Won Me Over!", "Author": "Harvey E. Lee Jr.", "ReviewID": "RWQ1NBORMAJGV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased a Kodak dx3700 camera for Xmas for my extremely non-technical wife (no docking station). After reading countless reviews and visiting manufacturer websites, I decided on a Kodak Easyshare Camera. I originally wanted the dx3600 because it had an optical zoom lens. Unfortunately, due to lack of supply and time frame, I had to get to the dx3700 in order to have a gift under the tree. This was my 1st digital purchase. Ease of use and picture quality were my main concerns because we will primarily print the photos.To my surprise, the ease of taking photos and downloading photos was EXCEPTIONAL! I was even surprised that the photos had a date/time stamp and downloaded pictures were automatically categorized into new folders by date (GREAT FEATURE!). In regards to ease of use, THERE IS NOTHING BETTER! Literally, after 10 minutes, we were taking photos and making prints. We were all impressed. However, we had nothing to compare the picture quality to. My wife was also hesitant to let me know that she would have liked a zoom lens.I began to research \"comparable\" cameras with zoom lenses. After thinking about upgrading to a dx3900, I decided to try another brand. I already knew Kodak's picture quality because the dx3900 is basically a dx3700 with 2x zoom.After reading many more reviews and evaluating pros & cons, I decided to try the Canon A20. It was \"only\" 2.1 Megapixels, but it had a 3x zoom and looked like a Point & Shoot. Unfortunately, it did not have a date/time stamp. I purchased one from a retail store knowing that I would return it and buy it much cheaper online. I unpacked it. I immediately noticed that it required 4 AA batteries. The Kodak required only 1 Lithium or 2 AA Ni-MH. The Canon was MUCH more difficult to set up. Kodak had spoiled me. Canon's camera interface and software installation were MUCH more complex. I became nervous because I thought it would be to complicated for my wife to enjoy. I completed all setups. I had her hold the Canon and Kodak, then take some identical pictures with both cameras using the zoom and different settings indoors (where most of her pictures would be taken anyway). I printed them, then gave her a \"Pepsi Challenge\".All of the pictures that she preferred were from the 2.1MP Canon, not the 3.1MP Kodak. The Kodak's were not bad. The Canon's were just better. Contrary to what I would have thought (being a digital novice), she was right. Although Canon's \"ease of use\" was definitely inferior to Kodak's, it had superior picture quality and a 3x optical zoom (remember: the dx3900 only had a 2x zoom). Although we LOVED Kodak's simplicity, we had to opt for picture quality. Although there will be a greater learning curve, picture quality lasts forever (If I can only get her to truly believe that).I returned the Kodak, and ordered the Canon A20 online. I was even able to get the Canon for less than a dx3900. Although I will really miss Kodak's simplicity, every time I look at a printed photo, I will know that I made the right decision.

In short it\u2019s a great camera.  However, there are several problem areas one should be aware of before buying this camera.  The first big problem is it eats batteries.  Depending on the resolution you are shooing at (I always shoot at the highest) you may only get 20 \u2013 40 shots before the batteries run out.  The solution is to buy several sets of rechargeable batteries and always carry a spare set with you.  The second problem is the flash is rather weak.  In my opinion the subject should be less than 8 feet for the flash to illuminate properly.  Even within this range some shots seem underexposed.  There are some exposure adjustments you can make but I haven\u2019t tried them yet.  Also I don\u2019t want to screw up the exposure for normal daylight since these shots usually seem fine. Another problem arises when shooting indoors with the flash.  The flash refresh seems to be quite slow at times.  I tried to shoot pictures of my daughter swimming and I missed several good shoots due to the delay in refreshing the flash.  I kept holding down the exposure button and nothing happened for perhaps 15 \u2013 20 seconds. This may be due to the batteries running down.  The 8mb flash memory card supplied with the camera doesn\u2019t hold many shots at the highest resolution. Less than 12 I think.  When thinking about spending the ($) or so for this camera you also need to budget an additional ($) or so for a 128mb flash card.  The camera does best in fairly low contrast settings.  If there are bright areas in the background the subject usually comes out too dark.That about covers it on the downside. On the plus side.  Under controlled or even lighting conditions the pictures are awesome.  Colors are really vibrant and very sharp.  For general snapshot photographs the camera is great.  The size is small and very comfortable to hold.  In whole it is a keeper.  Hope this review helps.

On the hardware side everything is fine:  the battery life is good, the picture quality is good.  I use a 128MB Compact Flash card with the camera, which can store more than 400 pictures at medium resolution (1024x768), which is plenty good enough for posting on websites.  The big downside is the software.  Canon provides a Windows application called ZoomBrowser to use with the camera.  It has lots of fancy graphics, and also lots of user interface problems.  Although the ZoomBrowser interface can fill the screen only a very narrow band is dedicated to the pictures on the camera, making it difficult to see what you are working with.  Whilst downloading the ZoomBrowser window constantly pops to the front, so you can't do any other work on your computer.  The browser interface can get out of sync with the picture files on your hardrive, which is extremely confusing.  Overall it is a bloated package which has lots of useless features, and does a very poor job of the one thing for which it is necessary -- downloading images.  I did find a better solution -- for $10 you can buy the shareware Cam4You utilities from [...]  This program does a much better job of downloading pictures from the camera, without all the cruft.

Except for the 20 or so that got wiped out by a CF card error when the batteries went down. I would highly recommend to anyone buying this camera - get yourself a USB CF card reader and dump the images frequently to your PC. And try to avoid reviewing shots you have taken in the camera. Dump the files to your PC and then you can look at them all you like. I would also avoid deleting shots while shooting, as this will put you at a high risk of card error due to losing battery power while reading the CF card. Get a large capacity CF cards and edit the shots when you get home. Another annoying thing about the camera is that when the batteries expire (as they do constantly), the zoom lens is frozen in position. Without battery power, the lens doesn't retract into the camera. The integral lens cap also remains open. This has to have been an engineering oversight.

In the end I just couldn't find the camera that had everything I wanted so I decided to buy a 2MP camera just to get started, and then a higher MP one when the one I wanted came out.It was a huge disappointment, for 3 reasons: (1) it makes skin tones look brown all the time, and pictures need massive desaturation in Photoshop (sometimes up to minus 35!!); (2) the photos seem to be not quite in focus; and (3) when taking macro shots, you never know what's going to be in focus.On the plus side, the Canon interface is a joy to use and the computer software is very easy also.I returned it after a few days and bought an Olympus C-2100UZ, which is giving me exactly the pictures I would expect from a 2MP camera.", "Date": "November 21, 2001"}, {"Title": "Canon S-20 A Winner!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R128CXC6OB457B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been an avid photographer for 30 years mostly using a 35mm SLR. I also carry a 35mm Nikon point and shoot. I thought a digital camera would be fun but really didn't expect too much from it in terms of quality images. Before buying this unit I read every review I could find on several models and ultimately settled on this one. I have to say that I am surprized and delighted with the capabilities of this camera.Accessing the menus is simple, the controls are easy to use and the pictures are terrific. The camera rests comfortably in your hand with the zoom control handy to your right thumb. To make sure I wouldn't run low on power, I bought 2 sets of Ni-MH batteries and a charger the same day I got the camera. I take nearly every shot with the display turned off and I don't have a single complaint about battery life. Since I started looking for a digital camera, I have been paying more attention to other people using theirs' and I can't believe how many people use the display when they are shooting pictures. No wonder the batteries run low! Personally, I can't see how they can take pictures like that... well I guess people like the gadgetry. The software is pretty basic but it installed without a hitch and seems to work perfectly. As far as a reliable, easy to use point and shoot digital camera, I think this one is great! I also think that some of my older stuff may be collecting a bit of dust except for the most demanding tasks.", "Date": "September 24, 2001"}, {"Title": "Perfect Camera for First-Time Digital Buyers!", "Author": "John L.

After looking at some high-priced models with major megapixellage (is that a word?), I decided that this Canon was the best. It's quick, simple, and does what it should do best: take digital pictures. Add a Canon S600 printer to your computer, and your images will rival that of any high-priced photo shop! The USB connection is terrific, as well as the video out cable for putting the pictures on my mom's TV after we got back from vacation!! Not much else to say except this camera is highly recommended.
