I chose this model over the XSi because of the price difference. The two megapixels more was not worth the $155.00 extra to me, and a year of use confirms my decision. As does the comparison by Bob Atkins. The dollars I saved went to buying a 7D this year, a major body quality upgrade, and the dollars saved from buying that rather than a 5D are going toward another first class lens. Make no mistake, this is a first class camera for almost any kind of photography. It is five star quality all the way across the board, and I recommend it highly to anyone on a tight budget.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Christy Girl \"Christy Girl\"", "ReviewID": "R1OGXNYEDZYRYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was informed to buy this camera without a lens because the lenses available to purchase are much better.

My P&S; wasn't cutting it so this was the next step. I have been happy with my results for quite some time, the quality, the clarity, everything. I love having the ability to use EF and EF-S lenses, I recently added the 24-105 L lens and have had stunning results.That being said, I'm getting more serious into photography and am looking to finally upgrade the body of my arsenal.Overall, I have been very happy with this camera, it was easy to get the hang of, it takes excellent pictures, and it was very lightweight.

After you get to a certain number of megs, your eye really can't see the difference in the same photo taken by this camera and a higher res camera. By then, it depends on the lens and the person taking the picture. People say it's a good entry level camera, which it is because it's user friendly, but it also works as a lower medium level camera. If you get this camera as a first DSLR, you can keep it with you for a while. The only time I would ever tell someone not to get it is if they really want to take videos with it. If that's the case, consider looking at the canon rebels with 'T' in the front of it's name.

It's the first DSLR I ever owned. I first bought one for my parents; after using it, I liked it so much I bought one for myself.I ended up getting the body only because I wanted to try other lenses. I got a Canon f1.8/50mm lens, and a Tamron 17-55mm/f2.8 lens. Both lenses are good enough to take any type of regular photograph.The build quality is great. It has a solid construction and it seems like it can handle lots of rough handling. Use common sense obviously; don't drop the thing! But I'm not worried about throwing it in a book bag or suitcase to take with me.The ISO is not as good as some of the higher end cameras.

Its pop-up flash broke years ago, and because I use an external flash now, it kind of takes the convenience out of a digital SLR with a popup. So I figured I'd get a new body and use my Canon lens and all would be right with the world. But this camera sometimes worked (as in simply turned on), but sometimes didn't. Sometimes it'd take photos but sometimes it wouldn't. I had to shoot my brother's wedding, and it's a darn good thing I had my old XTi, which saved the day. I sent the body back to Canon, and they fixed the on-off problem, but I still have a lot of trouble with poor lighting and bad focusing -- I don't have those problems with my old Canon, so I try not to think it's user error.

I have nothing on the display screen!! I have checked with a variety of camera shops to fix it and the lowest price was $400 bucks , well I can buy a brand new higher model for a couple hundred more!!! and the xs sells for under $400 now!!! when I did my research seemed like a WHOLE lot of people were having this same problem with this model of canon camera !!! You would think CANON would offer some sort of help but they do not...would I buy another canon well seeming how I have over $1500 bucks of lenses and flashes I kinda have to but it will be a higher model...I received this one as a Christmas gift ,doubt highly Santa will be kind this year..lol....I would suggest making sure your camera firmware is always up to date !!! and check before purchasing a canon rebel eos xs!!!!", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon XS woot!", "Author": "Aaron Nunez", "ReviewID": "R38ZASR7GY3BFU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this because I'm a starting photographer, along with the 50mm this camera is insane. I liked the controls on the olympus e-520 a little better, but got the hang of this. Don't like that the scroll wheel is next to the shutter button, if it were like the Nikon or the Olympus where you can scroll with your thumb i think it would be faster to change speed & aperture. noticed the LCD screen is clearer than the olympus, but it seems sorta dim to me in daylight. i like that the anti-dust feature turns on when you shut it off to not slow down turn on time. portability obviously not good cuz its a big dslr, but i gave it 4 stars anyway because its lighter than my old film camera and just as solidly built. Grip was my main concern, not really comfy and doesn't allow as firm a grip as nikon d3000 or olympus e520. those cameras feel like they were designed for the contours of your hand. Still, you could hold this with greasy hands, unlike those crappy slippery plasticky Pentax cameras that feel like those used up sweaty playstation controls at walmart. the buttons and layout of this camera remind me of the original xbox controller, it looks cool but when you try to use it its uncomfortable, sorta hurts, and you find that the shape of the buttons does not go well with the shape of your fingers or hand. I ultimately settled on this XS because Olympus has limited lenses, and i can't afford any of them. The nikon d3000 although equally priced, has no live view or anti shake. regardless, im glad with my purchase, gave it 4 stars cuz it looks really cool but its actually kinda uncomfortable, the button layout once again focuses on aesthetics and looking cool, but could be more functional (thumb scroll wheel anyone?) it only uses SD cards so might be bad for ppl who want fast RAW photos. for JPEG though it is very fast. anti shake automatically turns on when you focus a picture. didn't get the stock lens kit cuz i heard it sucks, but supposedly the newer IS version is way better than the old one, but i got the 50mm for this and it is crazy good. The fact that there are so many canon-fags out there kissing up to canon means i will find lots of used lenses for this. Anyway, respect to all cameras, they all have their ups and downs, but ultimately the canon had the most features for me, and lots of lenses means i can luckily find a cheap used one.", "Date": "March 10, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Canon 10.1-megapixel CMOS sensor\n3 fps continuous shooting, to over 500 full-resolution JPEGs or 5 RAW images in a burst\n2.5-inch LCD Monitor with Live View Function\nAdvanced & Adaptable AF System\nYou will receive the original Canon manufacturer's kit box with only the 18-55mm lens removed.
