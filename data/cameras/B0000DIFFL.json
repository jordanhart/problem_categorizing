{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera for the price", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1KVDP66A69VOL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera from a shopping network about 4 months ago and it's the best digital camera I have owned. It takes great pictures outdoors and decent pics indoors with the night feature. I took video at a high school football game and it worked great under the lightning conditions there. The video is not the best when hooked up to a TV, but its decent compared to other digital video cameras. It has a really good battery life about 35-45 min. The size is excellent but the only negative is no flash. I noticed even the DV 3500 and 4000 don't have a flash either.", "Date": "November 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good Beginners Camera", "Author": "Sara McGuire", "ReviewID": "R3ISIK8SNAEHGI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is a good one to start out with. I got this camera back in 2005 for a trip to Switzerland, Italy, and France, and it got the job done. It was my first digital camera, and insanely easy to use.The picture quality is not the best, and the difference between the middle and highest resolutions is barely noticeable save in how much space is taken up on your memory card. Over time, the camera itself will most likely begin to break. Mine has started to separate down the middle, but the camera still works the same as the day I purchased it and this problem can easily be fixed with superglue.I do not recommend this camera for someone who is looking for high-quality images. While it is a nice camera for home and personal use, the overall quality of the images is not great, and I find myself looking at other digital cameras, possibly a Canon, for my next trip that have a higher resolution and that have image stabilization. Another thing to note is that this camera has to be held very still when taking a picture. Movement of any kind often results in a noticeably warped image. The length of time the camera takes to actually take the picture definitely has something to do with this. It takes between six and twelve seconds, depending on resolution, to take a picture. The battery life itself is good, lasting about three hundred pictures before I had to change my batteries.I have no real complaints about this camera. It is a good, basic camera with few options, and the fact that it doesn't have a flash really is not a problem once the camera adjusts to the light. When I was in the Vatican, cameras with flashes were not allowed, and I found that once my camera adjusted to the light, I could take pictures that were just fine. This even in spite of the fact that many of the rooms there are barely lit in order to preserve the artwork.I recommend this camera to anyone who is just starting out in the realm of digital photography. This camera is perfect for anyone who is looking to take basic pictures and shines as a personal camera. The images I took when abroad are of good quality (though not the best), and the majority of the images turn out rather clear.", "Date": "March 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "No Flash, Choppy Video, Cheap Constuction", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2FWSYXRNXV8YW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This product is not what it appears to be. The case is designed to look like a sony handycam digital. It does not even come close to that level of performance. The video is choppy and the light adjustment is poor. THe audio is terrible, it sounds like a toy recorder or something. I would go with a better product if I were you.", "Date": "December 27, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good camera, until it broke", "Author": "J. Samples \"j\"", "ReviewID": "R18HYX2OWY2TDQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera and was very happy with it. It took clear pictures and was very easy to use. Although it was small in size it got the job done. Then, after less than a month of using it, it simply stopped working. It wouldn't turn on, the LCD screen wouldn't show anything, and when it rarely did turn on, weird sounds came from it. I took good care of it, didn't drop it or anything of the like. After repeatedly calling Mustek customer service and finally getting help from them, all they said was that it had a malfunction and to ship it in, but we never got a new camera. It was horrible service, and a cheap camera.", "Date": "August 22, 2004"}, {"Title": "It's ok", "Author": "Nancy Collier \"Aaron Collier\"", "ReviewID": "R1J1B0N9CU4FCL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well it's an ok camera except for the fact that can't take videos at 6:30 PM cause it gets to dark, and if I want to take a video in my house the blinds have to be open and the lights have to be on and it has from 5:00 AM to 6:20PM. Other than that it's an ok camera.

Iglesias", "ReviewID": "R23ZW33UCI34RV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the mustek dv4000 and I hate it, the pictures are awful! I used the highest quality setting and got very poor results, the only thing I do like about the camera which is why it even got one star was the fact that the digital recording I took came out OK, but digital still pics are awful and I'd advise folks to look elsewhere and not spend their money on this one. I'm sending mine back! I'm new to digital photography but I know on the highest quality setting, the photo quality shouldn't be grainy. High quality settings yielded low quality pics on mine....Anyone out there have a better experience? Could I be doing something wrong?", "Date": "October 31, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good for quick digital camera pictures", "Author": "Dorrie Wheeler", "ReviewID": "R2U1DAAF30U47D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I only use the digital camera capabilities for the Mustek DV 3000.  This small digital camera is great for quick pictures that are going to be used for digital purposes and the software that comes with the camera is eay to use.  Even the novice computer user can upload pictures with this camera.  The downside if no flash and the video capabilities seem to capture very dark video unless outside or in a very extremely high light area.  So I use this camera to take quick pictures of my kids or for items I am selling online, so this camera is very functional for it's quick digital camera functions.", "Date": "October 13, 2004"}, {"Title": "A quick reminder. 4.5 stars.", "Author": "Wei Yuan Lu \"iwylu\"", "ReviewID": "R21SB1AHGAAWO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Please have a look of the photos took by DV3000 at:[...] (still photos)I think the color is not bad, and the image is also quite sharp!I've found that someone complained this camera didn't work atall.
