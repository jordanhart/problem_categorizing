a year ago.  I installed it after scaring off some would-be car thief's.  I decided to replace it because one of my receivers went out and I replaced it with the standard Astak 2.4GHz wireless receiver.  I was impressed with the receiver (w/remote) and so I thought I'd give these cameras a try (the Swann was very choppy and I had to mess with the brightness controls in the software I use, a lot).  I use the second receiver to hook to the TV in my living room.  The cameras and receiver are in the same location as when I was using the Swann.These cameras are way better than the Swann.  The video that comes with this review was taken from my PC (I wire it through a Roxio RCA to USB connector) and use a freeware program to capture it (Debut).  There are three walls between my computer and the cameras.Others post about bad reception because of wireless routers.  I don't use one, but there are several that appear in my wireless network list on my Windows PC.  To be fair, they could have changed their routers after I installed the Swann a year ago.Downside:  The audio is choppy and has static.  I don't use the audio; I didn't use the audio with the Swann, either.  This is the reason for my \"low\" marks.  Also, in the manual I discovered that in low light the cameras will switch to black and white.  However, as you can see from the video, the b/w hasn't switched on.  There is a big flood light in my parking lot which may be the reason.  Color 24/7.  Judge for yourself.Tip:  you may need to adjust the antenna on the receiver to get the lowest amount of static.  I've found that moving it about 20 degrees at a time lets you see the difference.Well worth the money.  I hope this helps.", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good camera, great price...but know your environment.", "Author": "CJ", "ReviewID": "R228JX0I0KG6L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a decent set of cameras at a good price, especially compared to similar brands.  I found the cameras to be weatherproof, solid, and easy to use.Due to no fault of their own, I would HIGHLY recommend you buy the wired version if you live in an urban area and/or near too many wireless access points.  This is the primary reason behind the degradation in signal & video that cause many reviewers of wireless cams to wrongly give 1 star ratings to what are actually decent products.  You can download the free tool, Netstumbler, and use it on a laptop to see how many access points are in your neighborhood.", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "surveillance for home", "Author": "J. Graham", "ReviewID": "R1CDFXHADTBBF5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this to add on to my current system, which has 2 cameras from astak. Works great like the others. It is very easy to install. I keep one extra camera on the ready for when we go for overnights or vacations because it is so convenient = the receiver plugs into any A/V port (there is always a TV wherever we go, or owe can use our portable DVD player). We have a few reception problems because of several wireless devices (phone, router), but not too bad. It would be nice if the channel could be changed on the cameras to improve reception - however, hasn't hindered our use of it so far. The picture is still clear enough. The color aspect is not significant...depends on how you use it. We monitor our kids with it. Great product overall. I highly recommend it over a baby monitor any day.", "Date": "October 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Astak CM-818 - Great Value", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "RMJOAN4S1IB23", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This set performed exactly as it said it would. I also have a wireless router which did interfere with the signal until I simply changed the channel on the camera and then everything worked just great. One camera is about 60 feet away through three walls the other is 50 feet away through two walls and after a bit of receiver location adjusting video comes through with minimal to no distortion. Sure a wired system will produce better quality at longer distances but it comes with a much higher price. For the price offered this system did not disappoint (I would buy again). My only suggestion, if you plan to set up outside make sure you have a plan to hard wire or at least an outlet close by to plug in to as the battery feature only last a few hours at best. I ran my system through an inexpensive adapter at a local electronics store, tied it into a dedicated hidden coax cable and now I can watch security feed from any room in the house. Coupled with some inexpensive software purchased online, I can now be alerted when home or away, monitor and record audio/video from anywhere and receive emailed pictures/video of any security breach for under $200. Not Bad in my book.Hope this helps", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "good for daytime surveilance", "Author": "Gary Mccreath", "ReviewID": "R2KYYXEBOD7R8O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Have had these cams in use almost a month.

Taking the cameras, receiver and remote control out of the box we were impressed with the sturdiness and quality feel of the products, although right away the antenna of one of the two cameras broke off easily and we couldn't get it back.Unfortunately we could not get the cameras to work properly. First we only got black on the screen, no picture whatsoever. The camera has ridiculously tiny switches inside the wire connector that you can use to change to 4 different frequencies. You need a needle to change them, they are so tiny. After trying the other frequencies we did see the occasional static on the screen. It turned out that we had interference from a wireless 2.4 Ghz phone in the house.

Faust", "ReviewID": "R2G9S6RH7MH99D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera seems to work okay but pray you don't have any problems.The images received from the camera looked fine in good lighting.  Through a couple walls it picked up a pretty good signal.It did interfere with my wireless router (no internet while the cameras were on) and has no signal adjustment.  Had I kept it I maybe would have been able to change the signal on my router to resolve the issue, but I never got that far.The remote that comes with the unit did not work on my unit.  Not a big deal as I doubt I'd use the remote, but you need the remote to program which channels to cycle through and which to skip.  Since it is a 4 channel receiver and a 2 camera kit it cycles through all four channels.  You need to use the remote to program out the unused channels.I tried for quite awhile to get the remote to work.  I put a new battery in it, I tried it from different angles, different distances, everything.  Yes, I removed the pull tab and the plastic covering, the remote does not work at all.I contacted Astak via their website and told them me remote didn't work.  I asked if they could just send me a new remote rather then have me send it back to Amazon.  The remote is a cheap 5-6 button flimsy plastic thing so I figured that would be far cheaper for them to replace.  Astak replied to me with a PDF of directions on how to use the remote???  I then called to talk to someone and after 15 minutes on hold and two transfers I ended up talking to the same guy that sent me the remote use instructions.  I asked him if he could just send me a new remote.  He insisted I emailed him proof I purchased the camera first???  Really?  Like people try to scam you out of these cheapy remotes?  Anyway, I emailed the proof (replied to his message to me) and asked that he confirm he would send out a new remote.  No response.  I emailed twice more for confirmation and still no response.  I considered calling again but at that point it really wasn't worth the time I'd spend on hold, only to hope I could work out the interference problem so I waited a week for a response or a remote to show up and then just returned the whole thing.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Cameras for the price", "Author": "Ksyrium \"Ask me any questions you may have on...", "ReviewID": "RYVR2ZZ0PCWZW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "These cameras for the price are amazing.

It states on the box that the Wireless Camera from the receiver transmission distance is 150-300 feet (line of sight, reduced through obstacles such as walls) It wouldn't even work while the camera was only 5 feet away! I had 1 wall between the receiver and the camera which is a must because I cannot place the receiver outside and it still did not work.. Also the video/audio out cable is so short that you cant even place the receiver anywhere but right in front of the tv !!  Sorry for the bad review but a baby monitor works better then this !! I am in the process of returning this to the seller, we will see if I have better luck getting this returned and If I am liable for the shipping cost !!! which from reading all the other returned camera reviews I am !!", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "No good", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R2C606FCWTVOJI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Yes this was the worst thing i paid for on Amazon, i pretty much had to have the cameras right next  to the receiver to get a clear picture.
