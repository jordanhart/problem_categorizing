I can only compare it with my old Nikon 90 because its the only DLSR I had in the past...I know that to compare these two cameras is not fair, but this is my personal situation.The build of the camera is great, being able to move the screen is also a great option. The quality of the pictures is awesome, the adjusts you can make... everything is great, I just love this camera.Before buying this camera I saw lots of video reviews, and people sometimes were very hard with this camera saying that the shutter was noisy, or things like that... BUT if you come from a Nikon D90 or lower, you will love this camera.I dont have a compaint so far... everything works perfect, I even had a photoshoot where we had a little rain.. and the weather seal worked perfect...I'm not a pro, but I recommend this Camera for sure.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "The fantastic Camera without the items", "Author": "Knowone", "ReviewID": "R2GQSEYNSPLV34", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only dissatesfactory is the included items not being included. there was no tripod present on the package and some missing items in the cleaning kit. That said - The Canon 60D is a fantastic DSLR, with superior quality photographs and color, high resistance to ISO noise, very quick, very functional, not your \"simple for startes\" but rather good for beginners - great for the advanced photographer.I enjoy this camera for a whole 3 weeks now. The felivery was on time, the price (though 60 $ more than your ebay's best offer) is a lot cheaper then in any Israeli shop - and an overall good shopping experience.I wholeheartedly recommend this camera!", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera and FAST Shipping", "Author": "24house24", "ReviewID": "R21843SXUXWXSH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product shipped extremely fast and came in perfect condition.

I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT I AM AWARE THAT THE BOX SAYS THAT IS A KIT CANON 60D PLUS CANON LENS EF-18-135 IS, WHEN I BUY A CAMERA WITHOUT THE LENS THE BOX SAYS \"BODY ONLY\" BUT IN YOUR CASE YOU TAKE OUT THAT LENS FROM THE ORIGINAL BOX, WHAT DO U DO WITH THAT??? WHY DONT YOU SELL IT WITH THE LENS? I DONT THINK THAT IS GOOD, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE SINCERE AND SELL BODY ONLY BOXES, YOU ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE SELLING SEPARATELY AND ITS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY, SO...
