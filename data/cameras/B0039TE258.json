It doesn't come with a memory card or batteries, it has a computer disc and cable that comes with it.  There are some stickers in place which is required by the FCC and other regulatory angencies that peel off really easy, I think that these are only in place to make it look authentic.  This camera really looks and feels like a knock off, like something that you would by at a thrift store or a Swap Meet.  You will be better off using your camera phone, don't buy this item.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "just dissapointing!!", "Author": "testerboy", "ReviewID": "R3QS0FU49303GS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "when i checked this product out in vivitar's web site the product information says it uses a lithium rechargeable battery, the product i received (made in china) came with a \"3 AAA batery comparment\", the product has no memory at all!! not even for a short video test shoot!!, the quality of camera lens is  too low, the results??, pictures of a bad quality, poor colours images, the anti-shake function not seem to work at all conclusion: Just dissapointing!!!ViviCam 8690 8.1 Megapixel Compact Camera - Silver, i don't recommend this product at all", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R1KUHW8ANXGYZ2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I didn't buy mine through Amazon, I bought it at a local store. But I felt compelled to warn people about this terrible product. I've had it for more than a year. The focus is terrible. No matter how I shoot the images are blurry. That is due to a slow shutter speed. When you snap the picture, it can take up to 2 seconds to store the image. If you move the camera during that time, or the wind is blowing things around, the image is blurred. The more you move the camera the more blur you get.Another problem due to the slow shutter speed is that the camera is very light sensitive. I have tried literally every combination of settings possible. The only time I can get a normal exposure is shooting in heavy shade or at dusk. If shooting during normal daylight the image is always so overexposed you can't tell what it is.And if you try to use normal alkaline batteries, good luck. You can put in brand new batteries and not turn on the camera for 24 hours. When you do turn it on, the battery is over half gone. If you're lucky you might be able to take 2 pictures if you do it fast. After trying high capacity batteries designed for high drain devices, I do get considerably more time. But I turn off the camera between pictures, and if I won't use it for at least a minute, I open the door to the battery compartment so the batteries won't drain.So, useless pictures and unbelievably fast battery drain make this an obvious loser. If I could give it zero stars I would.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works good it is a good product and I like the way is looks the quality is good I would recommend this to anybody", "Author": "Kore tech th leather folio", "ReviewID": "R3LZT6H7TKXTZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works good it is a good product and I like the way is looks the quality is good I would recommend this to anybody", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awful", "Author": "Lyindiana Money", "ReviewID": "R1M68DSEI11E9I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wouldn't never buy from this customer because the camera wasn't silver it was black with silver on it plus the camera was very old looking  with a some scratches on the camera man,this was a waste of my money.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Arrived in a short space of time", "Author": "Jocasta20", "ReviewID": "R13BACNII2DD00", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this product on behalf of another person.
