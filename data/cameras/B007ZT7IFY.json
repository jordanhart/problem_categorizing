I had a Kodak which was a decent camera till one of the plastic pieces that hold the battery lid on broke. I needed another camera but didn't want to spend a bunch. I saw this GE camera on Amazon with no reviews at the time. I took a chance and, so far, am very happy with the unit.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great price and delivery time.", "Author": "megan bridge", "ReviewID": "RZ644BQICA8XT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It worked normally but didn't come with instructions. Great price and great delivery time. Camera was in great shape but wouldn't take pix without a memory card.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Grandaughter loves this!", "Author": "John W.", "ReviewID": "R2BUXTMB2OCC66", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my grandaughter's 11th birthday. I wanted an easy to use first camera that would make up for the fact the Kindle she got last year for christmas had no camera. She's delighted and especially likes the video making feature!I chose this because of my satisfaction with an older model GE I'd purchaced for myself.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good camera for the money", "Author": "dyiguy", "ReviewID": "R1L1T8KS8BZLKG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got the camera for my 8 year old daughter. She can use it ok. Some features are beyond her at this point, but not too complicated. Storage without memory stick is quite limited. You have to use lowest quality setting to save more than a couple. Sucks up batteries fast if you toggle back and forth between stored photos and the camera function. Probably buy stock in a battery company.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "A bad experience", "Author": "Lela Buck", "ReviewID": "RF7YEL2K3VOW0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this as a gift.  The camera arrived with the package broken and opened and then taped up.  I checked to make sure everything was there and the batteries were missing.  The camera was all scratched up like it was used and then returned.  I didn't have enough time to send it back and reorder another before the holidays.  I just bought her another gift, and gave the camera to her on the side unwrapped.  I have not heard rather the camera works or not.  My guess, probably not.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$48.99", "Features": "12.1MP Digital Camera - Black", "Name": "GE RS1200 12.1MP Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41aGskfpm5L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007ZT7IFY"}}
