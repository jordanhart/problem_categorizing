{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good camera for the price!", "Author": "C. SILVA", "ReviewID": "R1UE4IM9B1GEI8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded all my cameras in my business to these (I previously had the Swann B&Ws; which lasted without problems for 6 years). An excellent color camera for this price range - much better picture quality than many of the others (Q-see!) of similar cost.It is very small and discreet and my B&W; Swanns were very reliable for a long time. Very easy to connect and produces a very good quality picture. Only issues - (1) definitely needs a lighted area - don't try in darkened areas - (2) not a real wide angle on the lens(although changeable lenses are available like the wide angle and the fisheye - though not cheap!) - (3) audio mic is not great.Still a very good camera for the price. A reasonable quality option for home and small business.", "Date": "March 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Disappointment", "Author": "Ray J.

I was looking for a cheap alternative to expensive replacements from our national supplier.  I came across this unit from a known company in the security camera business, and for the price, I figured, it's gotta be better than what we've got, I can't even tell who's on the camera now.  I got this unit hooked up and the resolution's as good as the ones our security company set us up with that cost more than four times as much.  The other managers are stunned as well.  Everyone wants to grab one of these for their homes.  It's great when you can find a quality product for a reasonable price that does exactly what it's supposed to.  You just can't go wrong with this one.", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very compact", "Author": "Bill Schebeck", "ReviewID": "R1KO6QO2UAFPQR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "You are paying for a small size not picture quality.

The downside is that the image quality is terrible, even with great lighting.  It's just not really useful for much of anything.  To further complicate matters, it uses RCA connectors, so you need to have an RCA/BNC adapter to use it with standard siamese cable.  It's not a big deal but they can be hard to find locally, even at Radio Shack.I wound up just replacing the overhead camera with a higher quality, wide angle dome (3.6mm lens, 1/3\" CCD sensor, 700 TVL resolution) and it works much better in terms of facial recognition, even at a greater distance.If you're using this for any kind of security purpose, do yourself a favor and spend a little more money and get something better.  That being said, it is a fun toy and kind of useful around the house, for things like inspecting gutters.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "little camera", "Author": "William A.

I plan to use it with my Earth-Moon-Earth dish to communicate with other amateur radio opearators via signals off the moon. The camera will sit in the middle of the dish to help me point at the moon. I will also be using it to measure sun noise so have rigged up some welders glass infront of the camera to look at the sun.", "Date": "March 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor low light capture", "Author": "J.
