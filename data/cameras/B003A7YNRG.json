{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Handy item for viewing narrow spaces.", "Author": "JohnDoe", "ReviewID": "R85KOT2MZLUB1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pro: This tool is loaded with features: a smaller camera neck to get into narrow spaces, wireless removable screen, both still and video recording you can play later on your PC, good 640x480 camera resolution.Con: The camera has about 6-10 inch focus and is not very useful viewing details of close up parts like surfaces inside engine cylinders.I would recommend the product for general viewing inside plumbing, crawl spaces, etc., but not for close up views like inside engine cylinders.If you want something to focus on smaller objects get optical type of borescope with focusing adjustments - like Pro Vision 618. Better yet get rigid optical type of borescope (big bucks).", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Results are not what I hoped for.", "Author": "Freda Yoakam", "ReviewID": "R3UGWJIC3HZO4L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I found the camera easy to set up and use.  I  found that more light is needed to make videos and pictures better.  I taped a small flashlight to the end.  That helped the image a little,  but hurt the access. (needed a bigger hole in wall, more room to get around in the engine compartment, etc).  I'm sure I will find uses for this camera.  The case is very nice to house it in and keep it safe. I really was hoping for a crisp, clear image that would produce a clear print.  Not happening so far, but I will keep practicing with the unit.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better that expected picture quality", "Author": "Dual-500", "ReviewID": "R3BWIIQVI0BA8Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For me this is one of those tools that gets pondered for years - do I really need it?  Sure would be nice to have, but need other stuff more and so on.  So, I have an automotive project going and need to look into hard to access areas around the fuel tank and don't want to have to drop the tank if can figure out an easier way to replace fuel pump.This is also one of those tools that once purchased I found many other uses for that I didn't consider when buying it.  Already used it on a home improvement project adding in wall speakers cut into the soffit face in both bathrooms.  I was able to snake the camera through a hole made in the cabinet side wall for the speaker wires and look inside the soffits.  Confirmed how they were framed up so I knew without a doubt where to cut the holes in the sheetrock for the speakers.It works great, picture is clear and a little better than expected.  Color and the 3.5\" monitor is a big plus.  Having the monitor wireless is another nice feature.  It comes with a small magnetic mounting base for use when monitor is detached from hand held camera unit.  Great for automotive uses.Overall I'm really pleased with the Extech.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "TERRIBLE Pictures", "Author": "ontherock2", "ReviewID": "R2BLBRF396HT2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a terrible product.
