{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect, pocket-sized digital camera.  Excellent choice. Big thumbs up to buy.", "Author": "Los Angeles Reader \"LA,  CA Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R30FR9W316KDE1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Panasonic has reached perfection to put in your pocket with this DMC-LZ5 camera.  This small, yet easy-to-hold 6 MP, 6X-optical zoom digital camera takes excellent quality photos of especially good color reproduction.  The zoom is very powerful.  The camera starts up in less than 5 seconds.  It has the least amount of shutter-lag, about 1-2 seconds, that I've experienced.  It takes sequential photos with such speed that you can keep on clicking and get moving objects with clarity.  It has anti-shake technology.It exhausts my rechargeable batteries within about 10-15 photos.  It takes two AA batteries.  So one needs to maintain a supply of charged batteries.  It holds the settings when changing batteries and when turned off (when you select the no-reset option).The camera does not have a viewfinder, but its 2.5-inch screen is quite satisfactory and shows the selected view clearly and accurately.  Its size diagonally is 2 7/8 inches.I am very impressed with the fine detail and the so-realistic reproduction of scenes that you may think you are looking at the real object, and the color reproduction.  The blues and greens, as well as the reds and yellows, are stunning.  It takes photos close-up to about 6 to 8 inches in focus and with wonderful clarity.It has a superb fold-over lens cover to protect the lens while the camera is turned off.  So you don't have to worry about lens damage or losing the lens cover.I found the camera very easy to acquire a working knowledge of without the manual, which was not much help.With a 128 MB secure digital memory card I can take about 600 photos at a 640X480 setting.The only downfall(s) are:The manual with it, like most electronics/camera manuals, fails to give complete instructions.  The sections do not start at the beginning by telling you which settings or mode to be in when following the instructions.  The manual I have seems to be geared to another model of camera.  For instance, when I tried to find the 640 X 480 setting, the camera did not select pixels that way, but rather by 3M,2M,1M,.3M, and the chart did not convert to that means of measuring pixels.The Panasonic \"simple viewer\" software is not simple.  It apparently has a special driver necessary to view or upload photos, which did not transfer to my PC.  However, there are three different software programs on the accompanying CD, one of which is an excellent ArcSoft program that I found easy to use and very complete.  Also there is an Adobe software program on the CD.All-in-all, I recommend this camera to the Amazon.com readers.  The price is reasonable for all that it packs into it.  You will be very happy with this camera whether you are a weekend birdviewing fan, a parent wanting to memorialize a baby or a child in play, or are using the camera for commercial or professional reasons.  Just be prepared with a plentiful supply of charged batteries.May 6, 2007, UPDATE:  After over a year of use, this camera has become my favorite and most used camera.  My comments above, first written last year, remain my opinion of this perfect camera.  I found that Radio Shack rechargeable AA batteries hold charges longest.  I discovered this camera's excellent \"motion picture mode\", which you use by turning a dial on top of the camera and then clicking the picture-takng button to activate and clicking again to stop.  It takes SD media cards.  With a 1G or 2G card, you have plenty of SD storage for both stills and motion pictures.  I like to take motion pictures of surfers, pelicans diving for dinner in Santa Monica Bay, and wrapearound views of my rose and blue-lavender bearded irises.  The colors are vibrant.  My one difficulty is viewing images on the LCD screen in bright daylight.  At under $200 now, this camera is a great bargain with all its features.", "Date": "March 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "almost perfect", "Author": "Kimberly Frank", "ReviewID": "R1JGF1H4Q9J8K7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Almost perfect camera.Small and light weight. Takes great pictures. Image stabilization worked wonders when taking fireworks even without a tripod. Clarity and contrast is beyond what was expected for a camera of this price. The scene modes making taking pictures easy even for the beginner. Being a camera fanatitic, I was impressed with the dual scene mode which when reading the reviews thought was just a one upmanship on the competitors. But when scenes change quickly I have my favorites pre-programed in and changing on the fly is a snap.Its major disadvantage is the LCD sceen. Although easy to see during overcast and night, it fell short during bright sun, especially over your shoulder aiming at the screen. I still prefer a viewfinder. The trade off is the large LCD screen.

With this Canon i was not at all happy with it the shutter button was hard to push down and the Macro mode for me did not produce clear shots. Needless, to say the Canon was sold only after 2 months of ownership it was NOT for me.I did alot of research on camera's after that and tried to find one that was well rounded and one that could take good photo's in the dark. With the LZ5 i found that it does take very good photo's at night, the shutter button is easy to push down and to focus on your subject. The Camera hooks up directly to your computer with the USB cable and you can download your pics right away with no additional software needed like the Canon, i like that very much that way you can download to anyone's computer without having to drag the software disk with you! The pictures have been clear and precise and has made me very happy. The zoom is totally awesome - this is a great feature on the camera not to mention the anti-shake feature which is great for shaky hands. I took some close ups of my betta fish on the Macro mode which turned out great (just make sure you dont use flash). Ive only had this camera for almost a month and i have to say i have found my new camera for keeps!

I've had it a little over a month now, and have taken hundreds of pictures.  Basically, the major negative in my mind is the lack of an optical viewfinder for use when it is really bright outside.  However, the 6x zoom is wonderful, and the image stabilizer overcomes all other complaints.  It is wonderful!  I have had a couple of times where it struggled to auto-focus on a close-up (macro) subject, but not too bad.  For the price I paid, I couldn't have done better.", "Date": "September 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera, excellent value, fantastic results", "Author": "Riverside", "ReviewID": "R1WJD8OXMHUVJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My \"other\" camera is Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ20 with 12x optical. It's a full size camera and not always convenient to carry around. The quality of the photos, the 12x optical, and the feature rich menus are superb. So, when I went looking for that put-in-your-pocket or purse or hang-on-your-belt camera I looked at this newer and smaller version of the Lumix.No major disappointments. I originally purchased the version one step down from this (the LZ3) and discovered that the video had no audio. That seems strange to me and I returned it and bought this one. While this isn't advertised as a video camera it does take some great video with sound. The video is in the Quicktime format and the file will be fairly large, depending on on long you \"film.\" And to share the video on the Internet or in e-mail you'll need to convert the file to a smaller size and/or format. That's probably going to require another $30 or so to update your version of Quicktime to get the editing features, but I digress.The photos this camera takes are superb. Excellent color and clarity and the 6x optical (ignore anything about \"digital zoom\" on any camera) is a vast improvement over the standard 3x found on many smaller cameras. If you love menus, here they are and you can manipulate your photo session in a number of ways. Play with the different settings for a variety of effects. If you like simple \"point and shoot\" and want to avoid menus, that's available as well. The lens quality of this camera contributes to the excellent quality of the photos. The lens cap snaps shut when the camera is turned off - a nice feature.I was espcially impressed with the flash photography of this camera. Sufficient, well distributed light with a reasonably quick shutter speed for minimal or no blurring of your perhaps moving target. Still shots always turn out well with flash (nothing moving in the picture). I've had very good results up to 20 feet on the flash.The Optical Image Stabilization, for those of us with the occasional badly timed hand movement, helps to ensure nearly all of your shots turn out well. Imagine a camera with \"gyrosensors\" that detect movement and then compensates. That's a nice feature for a camera at this price. There are also a few options for rapid fire photography so you can press the shutter button and fire away to catch an action sequence.If you like close up photography the macro setting is easy to use and delivers perfect pictures. Don't get stung sneaking up on that bee on the flower - you'll be closer than you realize!I've also had good results with the battery life to photos taken ratio. All the photos I take are at the full 6mb resolution and I can get a couple hundred photos on a pair of batteries. Obviously, use of the flash or video mode is going to affect this. (I use either the harder to find Oxyride non-rechargeable batteries or my favorite, the 2500 mAh rechargeable batteries. Energizer has a 15 minute charger for these.) Plain alkaline batteries go pretty quick. Be sure to set the battery type in the appropriate menu.The 1gb SD memory card (not included) serves me well. The prices for these have come down considerably and I get 326 full resolution photos on each card. Add some short videos and the photo rate goes down of coure, but on an average vacation, I think the 1gb card will hold up. I do carry an extra one nonetheless. I haven't tried the 2gb SD card yet ... the reviews I read on these weren't favorable at the time.I do have an issue with the absence of a viewfinder. The other cameras I've used over the years have always had that little viewfinder and I find I still take this camera and slam it into my forehead looking for that little image. The relatively large LCD image on this camera is excellent in normal to dim light, but in bright sunlight or in very dark conditions, I have no clue what I'm looking at and take a guess at the point and shoot. I found a high quality, small profile, spring loaded folding shade at Ritz camera that attaches to the LCD that helps some, but if the sun is over or behind you, that LCD image is hard to see and the image is difficult to frame. Practice with the point and shoot to see what you end up with on those hard to see shots. Unlike a film camera, if the picture doesn't turn out, delete it.Bang for the Buck? Very good on this camera. It's even less now than when I originally bought it a few months back. Hate it when that happens. Lots of interesting features not mentioned here for you to explore. Enter the camera in an Internet search with the word \"review\" attached and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by the favorable in-depth reviews of this camera.", "Date": "January 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera, terrible warranty", "Author": "Ricardo V", "ReviewID": "R6NWHLAVQYZG4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera 10 months ago from Amazon (the black version of it). It was my 4th digital in seven years, and definitely my favorite one. The size is just perfect to carry around, and the 6X optical zoom with image stabilization is hard to beat. At the time, I struggled between this model and the Canon counterpart, but at the end, I was really happy with my decision. I actually stopped using my video camera, storing movies in my 4 2GB SD cards.One week ago, the flash stopped working. I thought to myself \"no problem, the one year warranty will cover it\". Well, guess what, the warranty only covers parts, and the labor flat-fee from Panasonic is $170.00 USD. I can buy a new one on Amazon for less than that! I wrote to Panasonic, but didn't get a satisfactory response from them.I am switching now to the Canon Powershot A570 IS, which supports image stabilization, and 7 Megapixel pictures. Their warranty covers EVERYTHING for one whole year, so at least I feel safer buying their product. The price is a little bit higher than this model, but totally worth it.Something to keep in mind if you are considering to buy this model.", "Date": "April 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great all around Camera", "Author": "Gilbert Reed", "ReviewID": "R17D2BE4H9LUDP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only reason it did not get 5 stars is low light performance(which you can overcome by setting the camera manually). I have purchased 4 other digital cameras. first was Fuji 1400Z (1.3), Olympus C-1(1.3), Fuji 2800Z(2.8), Canon A70(3.2), and a Nikon L4(4.0).One thing that amazes me is the sales pitch that you need all of those pixels. It is possible to get a good 8 X 10 print with a 1.3 megapixel camera. Seems as though the camera experts want to fill up your hard drive with those enormous size photo files. BTW, The NASA Mars Rover uses only 1.3 MP.Now for the camera. It is better than ANY camera you can buy, if the other camera doesn't have the image stabilizer. The stabilizer works in the video mode also. The video alone on this camera, VGA at 30fps, with the stabilizer,is worth the price. My only complaint, is the video output. It is in Quicktime, insteat of AVI or MPEG. I know you Apple Freaks love it, But most of us use Windows PCs. To use Windows Movie Maker, you will need conversion software, of which there are a few good ones, on line, for free.  My wife, who hates hi-tech, gets excellent results in simple mode. If you put the picture mode setting on 4 X 6(in simple mode), you get 1365 pictures on a 1GB SD card. A plus is AA batteries, which you can buy anywhere(get some rechareables). Video, with 1GB card, about 12 minutes very high quality(VGA@30fps), 31 minutes good quality(VGA@10fps), and 35 minutes of better than TV quality(QVGA@30fps).  For low light, My 4-year old Canon A70 is better. I miss the optical viewfinder. That is the only reason it did not get 5 stars.I cannot stress enough the importance of the image stabilizer, especially with the zoom, which can be as much as 8.3X optical(with digital total is 33X!) No more blurry photos, even without flash.

I read the manual to learn how to operate. The camera is really amazing. I have taken ~150 shots of all kinds, and still on second set of regular AA batteries with plenty of charge left. The DMC-LZ5 has several pre-set options for scenes like \"night scene,\" \"starry night,\" \"snow,\" and \"candle light\" which look great when using a tripod. Everybody I show my inside, day, and night time images say how very sharp they look. The color is rich. I usually take more images than I need, then delete all but the very best composed. I find it friendly to operate this way: I slide the SD card out of the camera, and into my laptop's SD port. Using windows file manager, I copy images to the laptop's hard drive, backup to CD, and view... I put the SD card back into camera and delete all the images on the SD card. This process is quick to move large numbers of images using no cables. This is my second digital camera.DMC-LZ5 has a \"simple\" mode that sets all the features automatically. Can you tell I am happy with my purchase? Thank goodness for all the online reviews, I almost bought wrong brand. This is 6MP, 6X optical zoom for less than $200, and it works great. I bought mine in black. Since I don't use apple, my only complaint is the \"video mode\" creates quicktime files; so I don't use it to capture video. Instead, I use my MiniDV video camera for video.

Only had the camera a month so I am still learning. You might as well get rechargable batteries cause the ones they give you don't last very long.  Now the software package needs some upgrades in my opinion. You can view pictures but have to open another program to edit photos. Also to send by E-mail, you can't choose the size of images. Only reduces to 1mb.Now as you know when you send images by email you like to make them smaller so as not to send large programs. So you have to open another program to send lyour photo. I'm just saying the basic Image view could be a lot more user friendly. All in all I am happy with my purchase.

A thing up front, this unit does use 2 AA batteries and does not have a rechargable battery built in.  Not a huge deal since you can buy rechargables, but it can chew through regular batteries quickly, so the Lithium Ion or oxybutide batteries are worth the investment if buying disposable. I plan on trying a couple of set of the new generation of rechargables as well.Now, Overall, I weighted out which camera to buy. My brother has an olympus 710 and it does work great with the digital stabilization, computer enhanced and processed for clarity. This Panasonic LZ5 has an Optical stabilization which dampens movement to take a clear picture immidiately, without any computer processling. This does help well to elimitate the tremor on zoom.  Also, a great 6x optical zoom, added with 4x digital for 24x zoom. THe better the optical zoom, the better the picture will be if shooting in zoom. Digital zoom will pixilate a picture at high maginification, the optical zoom delivers true clearer pictures at farther distance.  Megapixels are great, but if you shoot with digital zoom, it won't be any clearer than the cheap model cameras.  Besides, this camera has 6 Megapixels, more than enough for the average user. This means it can deliver the capability of a 14x19 picture...and which average user prints photos that big.  most people print 4x6 or 8x10, and trust me, this camera will cover that brilliantly.  This camera does come with Video out cables for video playback, yes this can record video clips.  Also, their is the optional power cord attachment for when you are using it at the computer or hooking it to a tv to save batteries.  This does use any standard SD memory card up to 2 gigabites. My lz5 model has the capability of shooting picture in standard 4:3, 3:2, and a store exclusive 16:9.  The software is great as well. In all, a good value for a great camera.

After carefully researching the camera and making all my pro/con lists, i was very excited and SURE that i had made the perfect choice in selecting the Lumix.  Once i got home and opened it up and started shooting photos, i began to second guess my purchase.The 2.5\" LCD screen was somewhat of a letdown.  While large enough for detailed viewing, it lacked the amount of pixels to produce a clear, sharp preview of what my prints would look like.  For example, i was shooting photos of my sister's wedding (inside, under adequate lighting), and the LCD screen showed that the picture was clear and perfect.  However, when i went to develop the images, most of the photos were somewhat pixellated--and i had the camera set on the highest quality settings.Another major concern (and perhaps my biggest complaint)is the camera's autofocus.  Although it does come equipped with a variety of focus options, it only seems to focus on one specific area, never a broad area.  For example, when taking photos of my friends, it would never focus on their faces, but rather a dominant colored tree in the background.  So i have lovely pictures of an Elm, but none of my friends.  Even when i set the camera to the 5-point focus setting, it only narrows in on bright white or dark areas, never the fleshy middletones.I have been complaining about the Lumix for some time now, so i will point out one great advantage of this camera that i found extremely pleasing.  It takes in vivid colors.  I'm a redhead, and in every picture ever taken of me, my hair seems dull and brownish, but with the Lumix, my hair was a vibrant hue of copper.  It was delightful!  Taking outdoor photos of greenery and such produced rich, lucious tones of green that no other camera has yet captured.Overall, i would say that the Panasonic Lumix LZ5 is a mediocre camera.  If you're not a perfectionist, i'm sure it would be an optimal camera for you.  However, if you're looking for a perfect, film-quality print, i would stay away from Panasonic merchandise.

The fishing just happened to be great on that particular day and I was constantly standing in the boat trying to get pictures of salmon and steelhead being fought and boated. It was hard to steady the camera and I had some concerns about the sharpness and crispness of the pictures. To both my surprise as well as my buddys', the pictures were perfect.

They never show in spe spec the time it takes, on average, to focus and to save images, so it is difficult to judge before you buy, and slow cameras are so irritating. This camera is fast I like it very much.Battery life is very very good. On two AA batteries, it can go for close to 2 weeks if I switch it on immediately before the shot and off immediately after the shot.AA batteries are preferable to me than builtin lithum batteries because lithium batteries die sooner or later and to replace them is expensive, and I do not want to carry the charger with me.The LCD screen if big and visible in any light.Bottom line: Thanks Panasonic.I'd prefer than Power button had 3 positions, Off, On-Shoot, On-View, that would be comfortable for me, but no camera has it anyway.", "Date": "October 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Limited manual controls", "Author": "C.

My only complaint and the reason why I'm returning it is...I am not able to send some of my short videos of my little boys (I mean approximately 10-20 seconds long) to our out-of-town family as I have been on my old camera.  I keep getting messages that the attachments are too big.So, I thought,\"OK, no big deal; I'll just download them into a CD/DVD and mail the videos so they can watch via their TV or computer\" BUT just saving 2 SHORT videos are toooo big to fit into one CD.  Basically this camera is useless for me.  I'll just go back to my OLD Olympus and further research other cameras.I did speak to a tech support guy, Gary, and he basically told me that there was nothing that can be done to downsize/compress the email.Again, the camera takes great picture but for those of us who also use our camera to take short videos and emailing it to family/friends, it's no good.", "Date": "January 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Canon Camera", "Author": "E.
