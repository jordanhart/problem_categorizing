{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great package and exellent image quality", "Author": "Cindy", "ReviewID": "R2OFHAKYN8M0YS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The combination package I received with my Canon D60 Body Only camera  from The Imaging World contained just what I needed to get quickly up and running including a Zeikos Card Reader, a Vidpro Memory Card, a Zeikos back-up battery and charger and  a VIDPRO  SLR Case, at a price that was less than what a new Body alone would have cost from other sources at the time.It was a real challenge to choose between the Canon D60 and the t3i to replace my aged but indestructible Digital Rebel.  However, I went with the D60 despite the added cost and, having used it for several weeks, am pleased with the choice. The D60 is much better built  and more rugged than the t3i, feels better in the grip, has quicker and more accurate focusing, more rapid firing capability and longer battery life.  What I like most about the D60, in contrast to the old Rebel, are image quality, particularly in low light, ease of focusing and state of the art video capability.  Like all Canon cameras, the D60 is very easy to use  at the basic level yet provides capabilities that will take years to master.  The D60 is 5 stars in my book.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "ARRIVED EARLY!

I had a 50D and although in some respects the 60D is inferior to the 50D (eg body construction) the lighter body is a plus. I also like the swing out display permitting photos to be taken from waist height. The video facility is also top class.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon D60 EOS Camera KIT", "Author": "Carol E.

Got it just recently through Amazon from The Imaging World. A fantastic package with all the extras I needed to get started. Body only as I was upgrading my Rebel XT. I already had my lenses. The 60D has so many better features! I am thrilled with its performance. Imaging World filled the order so prompt, I had the camera in just a few business days on the Free Shipping. Always a Canon Camera user. This one is great and I got it for a great price.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "best package", "Author": "Alejandra Nava", "ReviewID": "R2SNEE0TI2U3KF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really want this camera since I know about it, the only thing I dont like is that doesnt have the syncro plug for other flashes.

The card should however be upgraded to a better memory class and speed but it works for a start!

I don't think I it will hold an extra lens.The only issue of concern is that the camera box is for the Body + 28-200 lens kit. So I think The Imaging World takes the lens out to sell separately, which is why the price was so low ($699). It's a great deal.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!", "Author": "Melissa", "ReviewID": "R3P62T63J8IW6E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a great middle of the road camera! I wanted an upgrade from my rebel and didn't want to get to ahead of myself and this was the perfect step up. It really shoots beautifully and quick.
