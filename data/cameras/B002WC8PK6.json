{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Casio EX-G1 Rocks!", "Author": "W. Fuchs", "ReviewID": "R2KTDS6OHK61W8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very impressed with the EX-G1. I've been a long time user of Casio camera products, until an unfortunate camera meets water incident in the Caribbean forced me to buy a Nikon S3 which as performed well for several years, until it died. I bought a Pentax Optio WS-80 and was not impressed, neither with the cheap plastic feel, nor the quality of the photos. Blue sky almost always looked like cloudy sky. So, with Casio's new introduction of the EX-G1, I was intrigued to find out if the almost twice the cost as compared to the WS-80 was worth it. Jumping to the conclusion... yes, it's worth every penny. Here are things I like, and don't like.  Slim design. Precision operation of controls. Interval shooting can be set to 10sec, 30 sec, 1min, 3min, and can record photos for 3, 10, 20, 30 minutes. The display can remain on during interval shooting, or you can configure it to be off (presumably to save battery power).  The WS-80 didn't have a display on/off option, and the interval settings may be slightly more flexible, but it's insignificant. I also like the video record button, which with one press, starts filming.  Casio's Best Shot mode is also accessed with a single button press.  The WS-80 has the battery, memory, and USB port under a single cover, which was quite flimsy such that I believe a bad drop would render the camera less than waterproof.  The EX-G1 has two compartments. The battery compartment has a substantial and solid stainless steel door that takes quite a bit of effort to get open; a butter knife might come in handy. Perhaps in time it will operate more easily. The memory and USB compartment is accessed via a thumb knob that pops open the compartment cover.  I like the precision operation of this compartment, but am a little concerned about an accidental opening while snorkeling, as the thumb knob need only be moved about 15 degrees (1/8 inch) to open the compartment below. A better design would have been more of a screw operation requiring a full revolution. Then again, the real probability of me inadvertently turning the thumb know is probably unlikely. I do have some concern about the tripod mount being off center. I also like the gazillion programmable options to setup and customize the camera to my liking. For example, photo's can be shot in low, normal, or high detail, regardless of the size photo selected. Whereas the Optio WS-80 only took high detail photos in the 10MH mode. Small high quality photos are mostly acceptable for the photos I take.  The USB interface is not \"standard\" such as what I use for my blackberry, or Motorola headset. It's just slightly different... would have been nice if it were the same as the other couple USB cables I have competing for USB ports on my PC, but that's not a big deal. For years I harped on a contact I have at Casio technical support to produce a camera with interval shooting... I'm happy it's here, and that it comes in a waterproof, shockproof design. Even the packaging (the box it comes in) for the camera is cool; it looks sort of like a rock.  I do wish they included a printed manual (the included CD contains the manual).  The Pentax Optio WS-80 is being returned, but for buyers on a limited budget, it may suffice; however, the EX-G1 is well worth the extra money.Update one year later December 2010: During the past year I've experienced the following. The flash and shutter release got out of sync, so all flash photos were nearly black. I sent the camera in for for repair, and they needed to replace the main circuit board, which was out of stock. I was leaving for a trip, so Casio jumped in and sent me a refurbished unit, which was a blessing since the original was quite scratched. Very good customer service! I've used it underwater in the Caribbean. Underwater shots look good. One problem, however, is that it appears in high humidity environments, and when left in the sun, condensation builds up inside the lens, thus all photos are foggy until the camera cools. An extended dip in the ocean, or cooling the camera in the shade seems to fix that problem. I've had no problems with leaks in the camera, but would caution that sudden contact with water, or swimming, may well put excessive pressure on the seals and force a leak. So, in my opinion, it is good to walk into water with, but don't dive into the water with it.  Daylight photo quality is good. Night time photo quality is disappointing.  I had a Nikon S3 which had a night mode where the flash would fire several times to illuminate the background, and always got excellent results, but the Casio doesn't have this feature, so the subject is illuminated, but the background is dark, even using the night portrait scene mode.  I really like the compact slim design that is the best of any on the market. I like the actual buttons rather than touch screen technology used in some cameras.  I look forward to the next generation of the EX-G1, whenever that might be.Update January 2011: I'm back from my two week Caribbean vacation and want to report the \"new\" (actually replacement camera) performed flawlessly and some of the fogging problems I had with the first one must have been related to water leaking, because I had no issues with this one, in or out of the water. In summary, I suppose the original one must have had just enough water leak into the camera to allow it to vaporize and fog the lense and sensor??? Anyway, I continue to be very happy. However, night photos just aren't as good as I've experienced with other cameras, as they tend to be rather grainy, even with the night landscape or night portrait setting.  Day photos are superb. I shot all at the highest / largest setting 12 megapixels.", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Rugged and Ready", "Author": "M. Chau", "ReviewID": "R33QJ4DHOTH2R4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Casio Exilim EX-G1 comes out of the box as a rugged and ready to go camera. Its build is sturdy, and although a little bit heavier than my previous camera (Nikon Coolpix S55), its slim profile more than makes up for it. Aesthetically, the red color version is beautiful and the aluminum casing makes it feel indestructible despite its small size.I had no troubles opening the battery or memory card compartments. The instructions are clear and simple enough on the quick start guide that the full manual isn't necessary unless you need more detailed info (FYI, the full manual does come with the camera, it's just loaded on the CD, as opposed to a hard copy). The battery took roughly an hour and a half to fully charge. The user interface is friendly, and the navigation buttons are intuitive and well designed.The Best Shot options, the alternative to Nikon's \"Scenes,\" are plenty and quite nifty - including ones I've never seen before, like the Ebay and Dynamic modes. The EX-G1 also allows for adjustment of flash intensity, which makes it a plus when a standard intensity level simply doesn't cut it for the different environments the camera is so well suited for. The picture quality, in both color and filtered modes, is comparable to my Nikon, which I thought was great for its price. The movie recording mode works quite well with good contrast and a relatively high resolution. There're quite a few features that I haven't yet figured out how to work, but so far, the EX-G1 hasn't disappoint!", "Date": "December 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "NOT Waterproof, Poor design, DO NOT Buy!", "Author": "Jennifer J. Ruiter", "ReviewID": "R2IFCOLH1U7KU6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is not waterproof as advertised.  It has 2 compartments.  One is for the battery, the other for the memory card.  The door to the battery compartment requires 2 hands to open.  The door to the memory card compartment opens seemingly on its own.  It is a knob with little cogs located in very close proximity to most of the other controls for the camera that evidently turns easily without the user being aware.  Unfortunately it opened the second time we had the camera in the water.  This occurred while we were on our honeymoon and as a result we lost the pictures we had taken thus far and were left without the camera we had purchased expressly for the trip.Casio refused to do anything for us stating that it was due to operator error. We were told that we \"must have opened the compartment door.\"  Why we would have intentionally opened the compartment door prior to entering the water is beyond me. We are now out $300, a camera and many pictures that cannot be replaced.  Up until the time this occured we were very excited about the camera and had been showing it off and talking it up to family and friends. Now we are left with a very poor opinion of Casio, their products and their customer service.I see that others have had the same experience with this camera in th short time since its release.  This indicates to me a design flaw in the location/mechanism for the compartment door.  It is my belief that Casio should do the right thing, admit they have a problem and compensate those of us who purchased their camera in good faith expecting a quality product that would serve us for the purposes for which it was advertised.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "R3AIB5BBSIM0FX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When you open the box and pick up this camera for the first time, you notice two things: First: Its heavy. Not too heavy, but heavy. Second: Its thin, much thinner than I expected it to be. When you start it up, you are dazzled by the brightness and clarity of the LCD display.I was used to smaller and not so bright displays.I had to make changes to the saturation to get good pictures. The one picture of my sisters dog, Polly is afterI made changes to the settings. I am pleased, amazed, at the video this camera takes, again much better than I had thought it would be. I am a little disappointed at the quality of the pictures, not so much the color, but the whites. On my two GS Dogswhere the white blends into the black, the whites seem more like grayish and the blacks are blotted. I will play with it more.I also can't find the owners manual; I don't know if I lost it when I opened the box or if it did not come with the box. Not that REAL MEN use owners manuals anyway. But it would be nice. Nothing on their website as of yet.One more semi-negative thing:Battery: To charge it, you must remove the battery from the camera. On the Kodak, you just plug the mini-usb cable in and while youare transferring pictures the camera charges. I had hoped, this would be the same, as it is very smart of anyone to allow this.I guess not.The good news is that you do not lose your time / date settings when you remove the battery. Overall, for about three hours of use, I am pretty impressed with the camera. Its heavy and seems like it is put togetherto last. I hope so for the money it costs.", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Casio Exilim EX-G1 design flaw", "Author": "James Siart \"Cycling Enthusiast\"", "ReviewID": "RKTWRDA8IX1LM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The design issue I have with this camera is the knob you see on the side of the camera, it turns to open the door panel to the USB/Memory card.  This knob can be turned by accident and open without you knowing about it.  This happened to me when I put the camera in my swimming shorts pocket and went into a pool.  My moving around in the pool with my girlfriend caused the knob to turn, opening the door and destroying the camera.I call this a design flaw, because the door panel that covers the battery requires a pry bar tool that you attach to your camera leash.  It's a two hand effort to get that door panel open, yet the USB/Memory card panel can be open with just a brush to the knob.  As I found out I can open it with no hands!When I sent the camera to Casio's authorized repair center.  They told me Casio has instructed them that any water that gets into this camera is caused by user error and the warranty does not apply.  That is pretty presumptuous, the user is always the cause of the problem...Moral of this story, beware of buying a newly released product as this is Casio's first entry into the tough and rugged camera line.  I'm sure this will be fixed in time and then it's a nice camera to compete with Cannon and Olympus, but until then, I recommend staying away from this camera or you will be like me, out $300 and looking to buy another camera.Spoke directly with Casio customer service today and they confirmed what the Casio repair had told me.  If the camera fails because of a water leak, it is the fault of the owner and not Casio.

Stevens", "ReviewID": "R3A2919KDTT817", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera as a Christmas gift and I was worried about the lack of reviews that were available. Anyways I decided to get this camera and take my chances.  I chose to get a weatherproof camera because my last point and shoot camera that had lasted me for 3 years broke as soon as I dropped it in the sand.  I needed a camera that I could take with me while I do everything and that would not break as soon as some water was spilled on it.  I just got back from my ski trip and it was about 5 degrees and snowing and they had the snow makers on as well.  I took my camera out of my pocket and took a video while skiing down a slope, by the end of the slope the camera was COVERED in ice and snow.  I thought it was going to freeze and probably break my camera.  I tried to get the ice off then I put it back in my pocket.  When I checked back up on my camera it was fine and worked perfectly well.  It didn't even loose a single block of charge on the battery indicator.  I was so proud of my camera's performance that I thought I would share it with other people that are thinking about buying this camera.  So as far as the rugidness goes, this camera is great and well worth the money.Quality:  I use a Canon DSLR for 90% of my shooting, so for me I was really worried about the quality and the need to use flash once again.  After putting all of the Christmas day photos up on my computer to be edited using Photoshop's Lightroom (one of the best and easiest tools to edit, and well worth the money) I could tell which photos were taken with the Casio ex-g1 and the canon xsi.  However after some simple editing like red-eye and brightness and contrast the photos surprising look amazingly similar.  Honestly for some of the photos I CANNOT tell which camera took the photo.  The quality is good for what the camera does.  If you are using the digital zoom you can bet your money the photo will not turn out well, but if you are using it for close up photos of family and friends or bright landscapes then you should be fine. I use this camera as my go anywhere do anything, fast camera when I just need a group shot of my friends or quick family photos taken.  So for me the quality is really good.Pros: Good quality shots, another amazing thing I forgot to mention was that this camera has about 1,000 different settings for a point and shoot you can truly control a lot of different things like a digital slr, the design is really cool as well it even has optional side protectors, extremly small and portable, thin, easy to use and understand menus, large and clear screen, quick start up time, many languages for menus, great weatherproofingCons: Time between photos is slightly long might also be due to my memory card speed, takes a mirco sd card which is really really small and easy to lose, you have to either use a key to open the battery compartment or use your fingernail but it is somewhat difficult to get used to", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Casio quality and durability", "Author": "GEORGES R.

Kayaking in summer and skiing in winter calls for a durable, waterproof and compact camera. I have owned four Pentax Optios, WR33, W30 ,W60 and W80 and found each new model worse than the previous one; inferior optics and cheaply built. I have only kept the WR33. To replace the other three I chose a Casio Exilim EX G1 because I have never had a problem with my Casio GZ 1 cell phone or  G-Shock watches, rugged and well designed. Since receiving the EX G1 in early December I have taken about 300 pictures outdoors and 100 indoors. The only problem is red eye reduction indoors due to the fact that the flash is located extremely close to the lens, but I still give the camera a well deserved 5 stars because of all its other features, after all it performs perfectly in freezing temperatures, can takes a beating (I've droped it twice and not even a scratch).It is also very small , Battery life is almost twice as long as my ex Pentax's was.

I don't mean small, I mean smaller than iPhone tiny. I don't care how big and scary you are, but if you holding your camera with two fingers, like a dirty napkin, that does not scream manly to me.Lens is smaller than a fingernail.After that initial impression things started to get better. Body is solid and sturdy. All latches and doors feel durable.My other camera is Nikon D60 DSLR, and picture quality I will be comparing to that.After spending a bit of time playing around with settings, I took some pictures indoors and outdoors, and I am incredibly impressed by picture quality. Outdoor shots are sharp and vibrant, indoor shots with flash are pretty decent, with very good color reproduction and almost perfect auto white balance. Indoor shots without flash, came out pretty good, after I manually lowered ISO and stabilized the camera. After importing pictures to Nikon Capture NX 2, and making quick adjustments, pictures look so good, you would never believe they came out of such tiny device.Despite the fact that official specifications do not list any image stabilization, this camera has built in \"anti shake\" feature. I tried it with pictures and video and in both cases it did improve picture and video quality. I was able to make reasonably good shots in dark museum without flash.Dedicated video capture button is awesome and you can take pictures while shooting video.Overall, I'm very happy with it.

In my efforts to open the camera, the plastic snapped off exposing a very corroded metal latch. I also dropped the camera about 8 inches... just enough to send a crack through part of the casing and through a screw hole, compromising any hope of waterproof integrity.The camera looks and feels nice. It has good functionality. But it fails to be rugged and waterproof. Because of the misleading marketing, I feel that this camera deserves the lowest rating.

I had the Casio Z600  Casio Exilim EX-Z600 6MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Anti-Shake Zoom (Silver)before this for 3 1/2 years and that camera charged by setting it onto a base.  I assumed being similar design as the \"boulder\" phone that this camera would charge by setting on a base but I was wrong.  My fault for not doing the research.I pre-ordered this camera on Amazon because my camera finally broke after growing up with a 4 year old it had been dropped several times and taken thousands of pictures.  I have been accused of being a paparazzi by my friends.  I take at least 150 pictures a month and for a point and shoot gal that is a lot.The quality of the pictures I have taken so far are wonderful.  A feature that I especially love with 2 young children is when you are in video mode you can take a snapshot with out exiting the video.  This also has one touch video once camera is on so no fiddling around with buttons when trying to capture the kids!This camera takes the \"miniSD\" card Kingston 4GB Micro-SD Card With SD and Mini-SD Adapters - Retail Package.  I did not know this either when I purchased but luckily I had a 2GB one in my camera I am using temporarily.  With the 2GB you can take 425 pictures or 10 min of video.  I like to use my video function so I plan on buying a bigger memory card.I loved the BS aka Best Shot feature of my old camera because it shows you a picture of what the setting is instead of some random symbol.  They have updated the camera so as you change lighting (walking from inside to outside) it will automatically adjust and grab a scene from the BS feature or you can go to the menu and select the scene that works.The two sections of the camera that need to be opened regularly  (1) to charge battery. 2) to remove memory card. ) seem not to click shut so it's hard to tell when they are closed which is worrisome for the waterproof feature.  The rubber gaskets make it a soft shut.  The wheel that turns to open the compartment for the memory card is a little funky and I wonder how it will hold up.The lens of the camera is always exposed so little hands make fingerprints on it but the plus side is that there is nothing to retract or extend and get damaged.

I was a bit disappointed with the pictures but I have found that the auto modes can only do so much and for some pictures you really have to take control. You can set and save those custom settings as templates so that is a very nice feature but it's really a $200 Casio 12MP camera with $100 of water/shock proofing and styling/ergonomics so don't compare it directly with other $300 cameras. Plus it uses a compact folded lens design that is not known for high quality pictures. I wanted a thin camera that would fit in my shirt pocket comfortably and still be shock and water resistant if it slid out and that is what I got so I can't really complain as it is a good compromise of features in a small camera.The styling is what makes this camera really stand out, especially the red model and it attracts attention. I have had people comment on it to me so there is that if you want to be seen as cool (and really who doesn't).  I see that the black version is already selling at a greater discount than the red. I think the red version though is going to be easier to find if you drop it in water or at night and it just looks better so it's worth it.  I'm going to get a screen protector just to make sure the LCD doesn't get scratched. It just seems like a good idea.  The case that Amazon is promoting to go with this is not to my liking, I found a LowePro case (Volta 20) to be better in fit and protection- I recommend that and it should be available locally and is carried here on Amazon with good reviews. It's a pretty good fit and will prevent scratches while traveling.  The USB cable is indeed nonstandard at the camera end but I may never use it. I find it easier as long as I have the cover opened to just take the micro SD card out and plug it into my computer (with an SD adapter) and edit off the card directly.- its faster accessing the card that way. Two end pieces or protectors are included and explains why the camera looked different in various pictures. You can choose the smaller rounded one or the extended one with the arms or none at all.  I prefer the short one which fits into my hand nicely - it's that ergonomics design working. I like that you have a choice.That's it for now.

Hock \"slhimages\"", "ReviewID": "R1DNUBB0B649AN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Exilim Date of purchase 5/14/2010This is my first Casio camera. Frankly, I always thought Casio was junk but I just had to give this camera a try. It was just too compelling!Opening the box, I was pleasantly impressed with the build quality. It is very stylish (the red one) and you start liking the looks of it right away. It has good \"heft\", doesn't feel cheap and gives the overall feel and appearance of good quality.I set the battery to charging while assembling the plastic guard and hand strap. Use a GOOD screwdriver to do this unless you like messed up screws. I had one for glasses that had exactly the right size bit so I was good to go. Everything went perfect. The screws are quite small so work carefully and take your time.I had already downloaded the manual from the web so I looked that over while charging the battery. This camera is loaded for bear on features ... wow ... too many really. I probably won't try half of them!I bought this camera to take sailing, kayaking and as a general walkabout camera. I use my Panasonic FZ35, or Nikon for the \"Good Stuff\". I was not expecting a DSLR quality when I bought this ... and you shouldn't either.  Just good, \"fun\" pictures taken where I wouldn't dare take my other cameras. (Unless of course I wanted them ruined!)After reading some of the manual, I opened the camera and put in the fiddly little MicroSD card. It's a dainty process.  I bought a Class 6 card right off the bat, 8 GB, in case I wanted to play with the movie function. I knew too that I would be using the \"interval\" function alot while sailing. That feature alone was the main reason for buying the camera. Being VERY careful that no dust was on the seal, I closed the door and latched it.The battery is quite small. Half the size of a book of matches! Amazing. The charger is a separate unit, nicely made and charged the battery in about 2 hours. I opened the battery compartment after charging was complete and inserted the battery. Again ..carefully closing the watertight door.Pressing \"power on\" the camera recognized the card immediately. At this point I formatted the card using the camera hardware. The manual says to do so. With the card formatted I was ready to do some testing.Scrolling through the menus with the aid of the PDF manual, I set the camera to the settings I wanted to try. I started with \"Best Shot - Auto\".I found the FIRST thing to do is TURN OFF the \"Make-Up\" function. (Page 48) This softens your images. If you shoot a lot of people pictures maybe you'll like it. I don't. If I want soft images I'll buy a cheap camera or soften them in Photoshop!!Because of the tiny MicroSD card and messing around with the watertight door, I resolved to do a lot of shooting before looking at the results. I planned to use the 8MP setting most of the time to conserve card space. I don't really need the 12MP files so why shoot them? This gave me 1735 still images on an 8 GB card. More than enough for my week long sailing trip.I made about 80 test shots ... outside, inside, flowers, interval stills, good light, bad light, close and far. I found the color to be good and the images all usably sharp. Auto focuse seems to work well. Considering the size of the sensor and the form factor of the camera, I feel it does a respectable job. DSLR ...no, nice little special purpose camera ...YEP! It is slow shot to shot as many others have said. This does not really bother me that much. There is a CS (continous shooting) function that might be interesting to some (Page 70). Download the manual and read about it. It overcomes some of the shot to shot lag in an interesting way.I found with all my playing around, shooting and viewing the battery lasted reasonably well. Total shots was close to 100 and I spent a lot of time in the menus, looking at settings and viewing images ...  using up power. When the indicator went into the red zone I recharged. It took about 70 minutes to return the battery to full charge.Now I needed a real test.So took the Casio on a week long sailing trip to the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Using the Panavise Mount, also purchased from Amazon, I took hundreds of photos on and off the water.At the end of the day I placed the camera in plain water, swished it around some and rinsed it off with more fresh water. On a small boat fresh water is at a premium, so I had to go lighter than if I were staying in a hotel. After the soak I toweled it off and lay it out in the open air to dry. Then I carefully cleaned the lens for next use.So far ... so good. Sound like I'm too fussy? Let's not forget this is a precision electronic and optical device. A micro computer coupled to a lens and imaging sensor being used in a very hostile environment! Sure, you can beat it around if you want, but it won't work long I assure you.To say I was anxious to look at the photos on my home computer would be an understatement!All of my use was above water in splash, salt spray conditions. I did not dive with it. Heck, I can't even swim!Overall I like the camera. The look, the feel, and the image performance. It does just what I expected it to do ... take good pictures in environmentally challenging situations. Its' potential main weakness is the rubber seals of course. Over time the rubber is bound to take a \"set\" and no longer seal as well as when new. Here is what the manual says, \" In order to maintain waterproofing, replacement of the cameras gaskets once each year is recommended. Note that you will be charged for gasket replacement.\" Page 33. I'm sure of that!Chances are the camera will be \"toast\" by the time you realize the seals are bad!  Oh well, I recognized all that beforehand and bought it anyway. It was just too cool!We'll see what happens. Meantime, let the good times roll!The one thing I did not like was the battery door. It is difficult to open on my camera. The release is tiny and trying to move it and get your nail under the lip of the door is difficult at best. Big hands or cold hands could never do it. I finally resorted to moving the catch with my fingernail and lifting the door with the blade of my pocketknife. Not exactly ideal.How were the pictures? Very good to excellent. In bright conditions good exposure and color. My taste required an EV change of minus 1/3 stop. Easy to do. It focused well over all but struggled some in low light.Would I buy it again after having used it? Sure! Most all my other cameras have been for my work. This one is purely for FUN photography ... that's all!  And at 60 years, I need all the fun I can get!Buy it under $170 (11/20/2010) and its a good deal. As the price goes down, the \"value\" goes up!I gave it 4 stars because of its low light focusing difficulty and its' potentially short useful life due to the weak gasket arrangement. Most buyers won't be bothered. If you're into real diving, look at the bulkier Canon D10 or better yet, invest in a real dive camera.Oh, and by the way ... That Panavise camera mount is super! (See my other reviews.)  Worth the money. I used in in conjunction with the cameras \"interval\" function for some fun pics.UPDATE: 5/17/2011I wrote an article on one of my sailing trips and it was published in Small Craft Advisor magazine (Issue #69, \"140 Miles in a Mariner\"). About 6 photos from this camera were published with the article.", "Date": "May 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "For $200 not bad, has more features than most of its competitors", "Author": "Yoda", "ReviewID": "R1ZL472E1KQLBK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Any review of this camera must start off, as reviews of any camera, with picture quality. With respect to this the quality it is about on a par with nearly all mini cameras designed to operate specifically underwater or in harsh conditions - mediocre. Cameras designed to these specs simply cannot compete with those not designed to operate underwater or in harsh conditions. The primary reason for this is the non-optical glass in the tough housing through which the lens needs to shoot. There is, unfortunately, no way cost-effective way (in cameras in this price range) to manufacture a glass with lens quality characteristics and as few flaws. Hence it is an inherent characteristic of these cameras to not have picture quality as good as their non-underwater and non-harsh condition cousins. Compared to those cameras, in this price range, that do have underwater and harsh condition housing this camera's picture quality is quite the mean (I have used quite a few so I can say this from personal experience).  Hence one must be willing to put up with lower quality pictures in order to obtain the benefits of the underwater and harsh condition housing. If one does not need this level of durability and toughness, it is not worth the quality trade-off. The quality of the video (both picture and sound) is also the standard for these types of cameras as well as all miniature cameras - mediorce (especially in terms of grain, noise and color rendition).With respect to comparisons with other cameras with underwater and harsh condition housing, in the same condition, this camera rates more positively than most because it has more features than most cameras in this class have. The camera has a manual exposure value override, for example, interval recording capability, multiple exposure metering pattern settings that can be selected, white balance settings that can be made manually if need be, a decent ISO range (up to 3200), color saturation controls that can be made manually and the ability to set face detection features on and off manually.  Few cameras in this class have all these features. This is the primary reason I believe this camera is worthy of a four star rating relative to cameras in the same class.This is not to say that the camera is not without problems. Some of these include a plastic tripod thread instead of a metal (how much more would it have cost Casio to add a durable metal thread? Five cents? Ten?), relatively low non-digital zoom (only up to 3x), no filter thread to cover the glass in front of the lens with a UV filter thus providing some protection (an important form of protection as this camera is intended to be used in touch conditions to begin with), relatively high degree of noise even when using the flash and shooting in only slightly less than well lit areas (plenty of grain becomes visible then - but this is common among cameras in this class as they have small light collecting chips) and the camera does not come with hard copy manual, only a PDF manual (when one pays about $200 for a product it not unreasonable to expect a $2.00 hard copy manual to be included).  It should be stressed, however, that nearly all of these weaknesses are also common among nearly all cameras in the same class. Thus they are not unique to just this camera. Considering this fact, plus all the additional features the camera has that most in the same class do not, a four star rating is justifiable.I have also tried this camera underwater to its test depth of about 6 ft and for about 10 minutes and have had no problems with either water leakage or operating it. Salt does have a way of accumulating around some of the tight spots however hence it is highly recommended to, as the manual makes amply clear, to wash with fresh water after using in salt water.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "If only it were JUST A LITTLE BETTER !!!", "Author": "Mary and Charles", "ReviewID": "R22BIAWR53UEIU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's great having a 'real' camera (not a cellphone) that I can just have with me.

After less than 10 minutes of photography while snorkeling, I saw a bright flash on the screen and that was it. Water has seeped into the camera and it was a goner.

While these both came out great, trying to snorkel with a giant ziploc-like bag was tough to do and I couldn't easily see the screen to observe the video I'm taking. Diving with the bag was difficult as well. So when the Kodak finally died we decided the next camera we bought would be a waterproof camera. We bought the Olympus Tough series but I didn't like the lag from pressing the button to the time it took a picture. So returned the Olympus and started looking for reviews. There weren't too many options out there and this Casio had just been released. With not too many reviews out, and zero user reviews I still thought I'd take chance on the camera.First the positives, the camera looks cool and we got a lot of great comments about it. There is very little lag from depressing the shutter button to the time it takes the picture so I was pleased with that. The screen is bright and it's easy to review the pictures quickly. Some cameras I had took forever to start the review and then going from picture to picture. The video was pretty good and was easy to start recording by hitting one button. No knob to turn or menu to go into, just push to start and stop recording.The negatives, the picture quality wasn't all that good compared to my basic Kodaks that I had. The colors were dull and flat. In lower light it got worse. It was easy to blur pictures if it wasn't very bright. I had several pictures from a trip to Spring Training that would have been fantastic but the camera let me down and there was blurring. Even with some of the settings for the exact situation, the camera didn't do a very good job with certain situations. Underwater pictures were fun and even video came out well. The pictures, however had a bluish tint to them rather than the accurate colors I had with my non-waterproof camera in a bag. So I was a little disappointed with that aspect. Unless there was perfect lighting, the pictures were washed out as well.My main fault with the camera is the fact that Casio doesn't stand by their product when something does go wrong. They do have a one year warranty and I understand the limits, but on a family trip the camera was knocked accidently off a couch onto the floor. It wouldn't power on after that fall regardless of what I tried. I was not able to take pictures for the entire week. I contacted Casio and sent in the camera. This camera sold me on the claims that it was 1. waterproof and 2. able to withstand multiple drops from 7ft. This camera fell maybe 1.5 to 2 ft maximum and stopped working. This was one drop and not multiple. After back and forth with the company, I realized that they were not going to budge on that 1 and done year warranty and not at least give me some type of credit etc. I decided that I am done with the camera and will ebay it for parts and replace the camera with something more durable and better quality.I wouldn't recommend this camera or Casio for that matter after this experience. There are now many other waterproof camera options out there and a google search for waterproof camera reviews will give you many other superior options.

However, the EX-G1 was a little too big, and after a while the slow startup time annoyed me.  It takes a while from pressing the power button until you can take a picture.  That started to drive me crazy.  So, I bought a non-waterproof one which was smaller and started up faster, and I only used the EX-G1 for water.Unfortunately, about the 10th time I used it in the water, it leaked and died.  I wasn't too alarmed at first, since it was still under warranty.  However, Casio refused to repair/replace it.  They said it didn't leak because of a manufacturing defect, and I didn't know how to prove otherwise.  Needless to say I was not happy.So, today I did some more shopping around for a replacement waterproof camera, and I ordered the Sony DSC-TX10.  I haven't received it yet, but based on the specs and reviews I think it will be much better.  It's definitely smaller than the EX-G1, and the reviews say it starts up fast.  Maybe the EX-G1 was my best choice back when I bought it, but today I feel like the DSC-TX10 is a better choice.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "best camera ive ever owned!", "Author": "vrtrip", "ReviewID": "R2574OCHQRMTJD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i go through a lot of electronics because im very hard on them. this camera has with held river floats and mountain biking and bar hopping while still taking the best pictures for this price range and snap and shoot type of camera. it takes the pics fast so u wont miss the moment and is lightweight small and easy to carry.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Subpar for Casio", "Author": "S. Edelman \"sbe\"", "ReviewID": "R3SB7GAI9FIGPU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned more than five of the various models of Exilim line and this is the only one I've been less than pleased with.  It clearly has design and/or manufacturing issues.Just outside of warranty the shutter release button popped off in without warning.  Given the camera was only lightly used (we generally use our other Casios except when we need waterproof) there is no way this should have happened.  The only thing I can think of is that the camera seals aren't working well and moisture is getting in.  This would also explain why people are getting rust on top.Casio must know there is a problem with this model yet they are not standing behind the product.  If you decide to purchase one despite the bad reviews I'd suggest thinking twice before using it underwater.  You might also consider using a credit card that doubles the manufacturer's warranty.  My guess is you're going to need it.Update.  I liked the design enough I decided to take a chance and buy a second camera when they went on sale at Best Buy.  Bad idea.  My son was using it to take pictures in the surf and all it took was one splash for it to stop working.  This is unacceptable for a camera that is described as follows on the manufacturer's web site...\"The EX-G1 can be used at a water depth of three meters (10 feet) for 60 continuous minutes. Water will not penetrate the camera even when directly sprayed with jets of water from every direction.\"Update 1/11/12Casio is telling me they will not repair the camera even though it is under warranty.  I don't mean they want me to pay to have it fixed, they won't repair the camera, period.  This is a camera I bought in May of 2011.  I've never heard of such a thing.Perhaps they have come to the conclusion that the design is flawed, isn't waterproof and there is no fix.  Unfortunately the solution proposed, which is to offer a refurbished low end, non waterproof camera in exchange (that doesn't take the same memory card I had to buy) is unacceptable.Oh how far this company has fallen.  I can no longer recommend doing business with Casio unless you are Ok with the risk that what you buy not only won't work but that the warranty will not be honored.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great seller but not so happy about the photo quality", "Author": "Christopher M.

As a digital camera, this is a pretty poor offering despite the numbers. Probably the worst dedicated digital camera I've ever used in all honesty. The lens is poor, the light capturing ability is hideous, and the video is antiquated mjpeg in a bizarre 848x480 resolution that'll invariably need transcoding. It's better than cell phones, but that's not saying much. If you're out and about taking photos, you'll probably want to use something else. When in ideal lighting it's passable, but nowhere near what you'd expect from 12M pixels. When the light starts to go, you might as well not bother.However, as a camera that you need not worry about getting wet, it's great in our experience. It's taken a fair amount of abuse, and it's great being able to use it under water without having a heart-attack worrying whether the external case is leaking. Anyone who's purchased an underwater case for their existing cameras will know what I mean. Being in FL means lots of light and lots of time in the pool.A lot of people are having issues with waterproofing. We've had ours for about 10 months with no issues, and it looks just as it did when we got it. Even in the hands of the kids it's still going. The opening mechanism hasn't been accidentally rubbed to open the device, which is pretty resistant, you can't lightly do it as someone suggested, not unless there are multiple models under the same SKU. Maybe if you're wearing massively thick rubber gloves...There's also a novel time-laspe setting, but the settings are woefully inadequate to do anything of real interest, which is a real shame, and probably nothing more than a simple fireware update to address the dumb software.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Exactly what i was looking for", "Author": "Mendy", "ReviewID": "R3JRYT26GFD396", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We needed a camera for family photos and this casio has worked exactly how we wanted.
