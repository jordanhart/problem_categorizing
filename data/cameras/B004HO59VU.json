Ease of use of a digital camera is an important feature for me and this camera stacks up in every way.  The HD video camera is a great feature as well.

I love it, it looks awesome with its black, sexy, chicness. It has awesome effects like punk, fish-eye, panorama etc. It takes clear pictures inside and out with effects like indoor, sunset, fireworks, cuisine, night, sport, and landscape. It feels light but also feels durable. It comes with the cables that you can hook it up to your TV and see the pictures on your camera on your TV, and videos...that is really cool! It is easy to learn how to use it. The sound and picture on the videos is clear. This is just a really good camera and its my third digital camera and it is my best so far. If you are looking to buy this one, you should. When I was looking to buy one, I researched a lot, and I mean a lot, and then I found this one and am so glad that I bought it. I love it!

I was looking for features comparable to my Sony as I didn't want to downgrade.  I found this camera to be rich with features and a few that others didn't have.Size was a big factor and this does not let down.I would buy over and over, highly recommended.Only thing that held back for full 5 stars is the physical location of the flash.  I find it is located too close to action button and seem to have a lot of fingers in the way.  After a few weeks I got used to holding the camera in a way to overcome this.FOLLOW UP 12/15/2012Camera is still going stron even after a few drops by my 4 yr old daughter.  The lens does have a retracting issue every now and then most likely from the drop.

Another issue I had with the camera was that it would never connect to the computer. I tried different cables and USB ports without any luck. I wanted to wait longer before I return it to give it another chance but when I used it to record my daughter's first performance it recorded everything except my daughters performance. When I tried playing back the video on the camera it would just say file error.

Pendleton", "ReviewID": "R34GXVVDY0A44Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hey, for $79.98 this is a great no worries camera. Yeah, the casing feels a little cheap, it's lacks the heft of more quality cameras, but when you just want a small point and shoot to capture the random things that happen in life, this suffices. Like other reviews said, it does struggle with certain lighting situations. Also, you have to play with the settings a bit to ensure that pictures are in focus, but, it just depends what the scenario of the shot it. Most of the time it does great just on the automatic setting. It has some fun settings too, for those who are fans of \"Instagram\" and other smart phone image editing apps, you might like the magic setting on this little camera, Seni Pop, Pinhole, Fish-eye, Sketch, just to name a few. It also has a panoramic setting, not the \"hold the shutter, and pan\" kind but, take up to three pictures in that mode and it stitches them together for you. Seems to work fine.In a nutshell, it's not a professional camera, but I assume if you are even considering this, that's not what you are looking for anyway. Inexpensive, and has a dedicated video record button. Doesn't perform as well in all types of shots as did my last camera (A Canon PowerShot A3100) But For the price, it does just dandy.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "5 stars", "Author": "K.

The Olympus VG-120's auto focus always focuses on the wrong subject when using the Program Auto and iAuto (herein auto-everything mode), so your primary subject is often out of focus.  If you'd to take a person's picture, it would lock it's focus on something behind the person, or anywhere else but the subject; this refers to the auto-everything mode. I am very tech savvy, and I can figure most technical stuff out.  I've spent a bit of time playing with this camera, and no matter what I do, the auto-everything mode (both P, and iAuto) still take terrible pictures.  There are other options in the camera that will make it take better pictures, but takes more work; defeats the purpose of \"point and shoot\".The automatic white balance is also incorrect.  Pictures always come out on the \"cool\" side of the Kelvin scale (white pictures instead of warm).  Night time in door pictures are terrible.  It's vastly inferior to the Casio, and no I don't work for or have any stocks in Casio.Shortly after buying this camera, I found the Casio camera and shot the same pictures side by side with the Olympus. The Casio's pictures are better by a mile.  I will definitely be using the Casio over this one.  I don't like to return things so I will keep it, but this camera is a waste of money.
