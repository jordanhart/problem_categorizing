I didn't expect much in terms of image quality, but was very pleasantly surprised at how good the photographs are. It also shoots stabilized 720p high-definition video that looks very good as well! It uses a high quality touch-screen to perform most of the menu selections, but once in shooting mode, the camera makes most of the decisions for you - just frame and shoot to your heart's content.This camera has a built-in non-removable battery, as well as 8GB of built-in non-removable memory. The upside is that you do not need to purchase a separate memory card - this thing is ready to go straight out of the box. The build is very solid for such a tiny camera - it is the smallest camera Nikon has ever made. There is just a single tiny door with a micro-USB port under it on the bottom of the camera that is used to both charge the camera (Nikon includes a wall charger, but you can charge it by plugging it into your computer as well) as well as transfer pictures to your computer. My computer recognized the camera straight away (windows 7) and transferring images was a snap.I HIGHLY recommend this camera for someone like me who wants something teeny-tiny that they can carry around everywhere that also produces reasonable quality images and video.**UPDATE - November 3rd ***A couple of weeks later and I am still thoroughly enjoying this little thing! I think the main thing to bear in mind is that the reason you are buying this camera is because it is TINY and you can have it with you absolutely everywhere.  Nikon obviously had to make trade-offs when making something this small - the main one for me is focusing speed - it is a little slow to gain focus - so you have to bear that in mind. Picture quality is EXCELLENT for such a teeny-tiny camera - as well as video.TIP - as one or two other people have commented, turn off the \"touch shutter\" function - stabbing the screen with your finger to take a photo will almost certainly produce more blurry photos than just using the shutter button :-)I am more than happy with this purchase - it definitely meets its intended purpose - something absolutely TINY that you can take with you everywhere and grab some pretty good pictures and video.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Bad", "Author": "manzana", "ReviewID": "RPS5XMB0WWAYX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ask any photographer and they will tell you that the first rule of photography is having the camera with you. This camera is very small, light weight,and really easy to pocket. Also limited menu options means that there is no learning curve.  Downside is a weak flash which frankly is pretty useless (unless you get within 3 feet of your subject), and poor depth of field which limits sharpness on those landscape shots. These negatives aside, I just took it for a weeks vacation to New Mexico, and was pleasantly surprised by picture quality. Since the camera is pretty much a point and shoot automatic, you find yourself concentrating on framing the picture which in many respects helps produce better shots. It also has exposure compensation which is helpful in both low and bright light. I certainly think this camera is a better option than the camera on my smart phone. The touch screen works, but to limit camera shake I suggest using the shutter.  All and all I would recommend.", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "R.

It's very cute, easily pocketable and the physical buttons are responsive.  Alas, that's where the good news ends.Over the past 8 or 9 years I've bought 15 cameras ranging from point and shoots to a mid range SLR.  Every single one of those cameras, including a 2 megapixel fixed lens Fuji has had better image quality than the S01.  More damning, my Galaxy Nexus has equal or slightly better IQ.This camera has a very poor sensor that takes terrible pictures in low light and bad to middling in good.  Nikon needs to replace this with a CMOS sensor.The touch screen is poor and unresposive.  Often even hard presses do not register.In camera options are minimal.This camera is slow.  Slow to focus, slow to take a shot, slow to change modes.  Everything is slow.  You'll press a virtual button and then wait a second or longer for a result.If you have a smartphone with a halfway decent camera this device becomes redundant.  I was hoping for more and Canon's upcoming N2 might deliver that (for a higher price).  This is a toy more than a camera and a fair price for the results would be $60 or under.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Nikon S01 has a MAJOR problem!", "Author": "RS1", "ReviewID": "R1TPM4VOD4FPN0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I saw this camera in a store and couldn't believe how tiny it was! The pictures it takes are really great! I bought it immediately. There's no removeable SD card or battery, which makes it real easy to maintain.  Uploading to your computer is simple.  This camera is great for scenery, sunsets, but you need to be up-close when taking pictures of people.  The built-in flash works okay, but it doesn't not have a lot of \"throw\" so you need to be very close to your subject for the best quality.  That's the good news.  Now for the bad:I brought this new camera to Mexico for a two-week vacation over Christmas 2012 and everything was working great, until a day or two before I was to return.  I plugged the cable in to upload some pix to my laptop and the S01 sounded 3 beeps and showed a red exclamation point in a circle, like this: (!), and there was a red, horizontal line 3/4 of the way up the screen.  I couldn't upload anything, couldn't take a picture, and couldn't see any of the pix that I had taken!  Turning it off & on still produced the 3 beeps and red line.  Even though I could access the menu items, I couldn't get the S01 to take a picture or view the pix I had taken!  I checked Nikon's website and there wasn't any troubleshooting that had this issue listed. I called Nikon and the tech I spoke with never heard of this issue and wasn't even that familiar with this camera!  I contacted the store I bought it from (Samy's), and they were great and said for me to bring it back to exchange it.  I thought that this specific S01 may be a lemon. I turned it on again, and it wanted me to format the card, which I knew would result in losing all my pix, which I wasn't ready to try...yet.  I tried a reset, but that didn't do anything to fix it.  I then got so frustrated that I did format the card, received a prompt asking that I wanted to do it, but never received a confirmation that the card was formatted.  I didn't use the camera again and the day I was going to bring it back, I turned it on and it was working and all the pix I took were there!  I immediately tried uploading them, which at first didn't work, but on subsequent tries, did.  Once I uploaded all the pix, I decided I was going to exchange it at the store.  One of the salespeople there said she had a customer the other day with the same issue, exchanged the bad S01 for a new one, and the customer brought the new one back two days later because it was doing the same thing!  So, this is obviously a major issue with this camera but so far, Nikon isn't letting on that they're aware of this issue!  I need to be able to trust the camera I'm using, and at this point, the S01 is not a camera I can trust!I really want to love this camera. I gave it 3 stars because when this camera works, it's wonderful, but until Nikon acknowledges and fixes this issue, Buyer beware!!", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "It Doesn't Get Any Better - For Me!", "Author": "Jeff J.", "ReviewID": "R2QRO9YZRIF56C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I debated a bit before I bought this little jewel.

I read several peoples complaints about slow shutter speed and blurry images, but can honestly say that I've not experienced any of those issues.  Instead, I've found the S01 the perfect partner for my Nikon D90, always handy for the quick shot and excellent for quick videos.

The USB cable has a proprietary connector on the camera end. Consider this. I suspect that many people, like me, bought this camera for its portability.

A hard to use point and shoot ? No way.The scroll menu functions tend to be much too sensitive and will scroll quickly past what I want, it is fidgety and hard to select function, that is a major nuisance.The battery and memory (7.3 gigs) is internal and not removable or replaceable.Shooting speed cannot be selected, and automatically sets it itself between ISO 80 to 1600.All that would be fine if it worked.Unfortunately 1/30 speed and slower pictures are common and with the focusing problems mean very poor pictures.There is no white balance adjustment or macro setting.I did found a hidden macro function, so limited that it too is almost non existent.The face recognition is primitive and thinks anything round is a face.More often it misses the human face. Face recognition that malfunctions is worse than no face recognition at all, and you cannot turn this function off.All in all, of all the small Nikons I have owned, this one the worst:It is not really a usable camera.People will buy it because it is near matchbook size and cute, but if they ever used other COOLPIX line cameras, they will be disappointed.The nuisance factor is very high, and it is hard to use with very poor picture results.Three thumbs down for this one.Highly Not recommended", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blurry", "Author": "Tracy NN", "ReviewID": "RYYD5KQ54Z0HS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Did not take clear pictures, shutter speed is very slow.

This camera is sub-$100.  It is incredibly small, sleek, and comes in a variety of colors.  Is has everything totally internal.  I find this kinda nice.  No battery door to open and battery to slide out.  No memory card slot.  No A/V port.  There is just one small door on the bottom the pops open and utilizes the supplied micro USB charger that a lot of stuff seem to use these days.  When you plug it in, there is a red LED on the top that blinks while charging.  When it stops blinking, it's done charging.  Very simple.  There are only four buttons on the camera and all on top.  It has a small on/off button with the LED in the middle of it, a zoom button around the shutter button, and a picture review button.  The on-screen options are very, very simplified.  The 3x zoom is obviously minimal and the LCD is grainy.  But what do you expect for the price?  The 10 megapixels and about 7GB of internal memory allows a few thousand pictures.  I have not downloaded the pictures to my computer yet as I don't have one yet, so I cannot comment on the actual picture quality.You are probably saying, \"My phone has a nice camera so why do I need this?\"  The simple answer is, you don't.  Why do we need a lot of things?  We don't.  I bought the silver version solely on looks.  It is more of a chrome/mirrored finish than flat silver.  It looks nice.  My girlfriend saw the pink one and said she liked that one.  Possible gift??The bottom line is that this inexpensive, sleek, incredibly small camera is something you will probably pick up to supplement your phone camera or if you don't want to clog your phone's memory with pictures and videos.  That, or you will probably buy it just because it's cool and you just want it.", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT drag-and-drop, poor ease of retrieving images", "Author": "Bandwidow", "ReviewID": "R1KQ7HVU1WX59G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was excited to get this coolpix, which is so small, and takes pretty good photos. However, my frustration level rises when I want to move the pictures onto my computer. The camera, which does not have a removable memory device, does not show up on the desktop of a computer as a device when plugged in via USB. Instead, you have to download the Nikon viewing software in order to access your images. I contacted Nikon to ask if there was a way to drag-and-drop and their very impersonal answer (at least they DID answer) was to use their \"Nikon Image Space\" cloud uploader/viewer. I registered for this, and then could never get it to work. I have not yet been able to upload images, or to install the proprietary software that's supposed to make uploading images easier.

Considering I paid under a hundred dollars for it, I am very content. Really my only complaint is very minor. The touch screen is a little (and I mean just barely) unresponsive. It's hardly a big issue, though. I also might add that the flash is not phenomenal, and the zoom is only a little better than a cell phone camera zoom, but both work well enough. (Tip: get within a few feet of subject if taking a picture in a dark setting). This camera would be fantastic for fast pictures. You would just carry this camera in one of your very small pockets and whip it out whenever you want a picture of something but don't want to drag out your nice camera (a Nikon L810 in my case).

It has surprising versatility for a small point-and-shoot.I recommend using a plastic screen protector (less that $3.00) and keeping the camera in a leather case (mine was $3.00 new) so the camera doesn't become scratched in your pocket.The only things I don't particularly like are that it does not use removable memory cards.

This is one of them. OK, it'll never replace a real camera, but the best camera is the one in your hand, and this one makes that easy. It just showed up, I spent the last several hours fiddling with it, and i'm actually pretty happy.It is really tiny; let's get that out of the way first. You can't believe how small. It really is about the size of a credit card, but about \u00be\" thick, weighs nothing, almost fits in a watch pocket and for sure in any other pocket, inside a hat brim....  really small. Thus, it meets my first requirement, being in my hand when I want it. I'm not about to carry a big and/or expensive camera everyplace, this one will work fine for a \"just in case\".  Like American Express, don't leave home without it. Or Visa, it's everywhere I want to be. Somehow it inspires credit card jokes.Quality-wise, not so much. It's OK, a bit noisy especially at high iso, but adequate. Not the tool for high resolution, big prints. Perfectly fine for small prints, anything where a bit of graininess is OK. Or, for that matter, where no other camera is readily available, which is where it shines. In fact, in black and white mode, the graininess looks pretty good. There's a bit of chromatic aberration and distortion at the frame edges, too. I give i a 7/10 for image quality. Much better than any cell phone camera, though; and better than cheap point-and-shoots with plastic lenses.There's not a lot of manual control options. Actually, aside from zoom, none. Well, there is exposure compensation, +- 2 EV, which is something. It does what it does and you're not necessary for that. Point, push the button. DO turn off the touch-screen-to-trip-shutter function; it just begs for jiggle.Internal storage for about 3000 frames at highest resolution is fine. Internal battery is fine, but I suspect it won't last more than a few years because of short charging cycles. That's OK, I'll make an effort to do a deep discharge once in a while.The little place where the (standard mini USB; not proprietary at all) connector plugs in is a bit of a trick; you need to catch the slot with a fingernail and flip it up and sideways. I wish the instructions were a little clearer on that. it's held by a rubber plug, just bends out of the way. Probably the only cheesy-feeling thing on the whole camera. otherwise it feels like a quality piece of machinery; nice, dense feel, great finish, just what we expect from Nikon. The chrome finish, by the way, is a knockout.  Once plugged in via the cord, iPhoto or Aperture find the camera for download just fine; no special software needed.I'm giving it a 4/5 because the image quality could be better (not sure how, though, with this dinky sensor. The optics are pretty decent for their size) and I'd like some manual something.Well worth the modest cost if you really feel the need to have a camera in reach at all times.

They were the talk of the holidays, and everyone loved and enjoyed their gift. The entire family could not put them down. After the holidays my husband asked me to get him one. It is small and stylish and takes really great pictures if you use the button and not the touch screen. Sometimes you get movement touching the screen. You do not need a sd card or any card, and will have to use the enclosed the USB cable to load them into your computer. It is so easy and they loaded immediately. So if you like media cards this is not the camera for you. Charging is a breeze, just plug the camera into the wall, or into your computer. It has a fixed internal battery, so you do not have to lug around extra batteries. And WOW does it ever stay charged a long time! My husband uses his a lot and just charged it after 6 whole weeks. Of course if you are a real heavy user, you may have to plug yours in sooner. The flash is not very good at a far distance, so stay close to your subject when a flash is desired. I actually use the flash very little, and have always loved the non-flash pictures. Digitals just take such good pictures. Play around with this camera, and you will be able to create all kinds of pictures. Just remember, because of the size, there is only so much room to put things in the camera. Nikon has excelled in what was added, but it is more limited than a larger camera. This little beauty is a conversation piece. I love mine, and my husband and I carry it at all times.

A drawback is that the battery is part of the camera itself and has to be recharged plugged into the computer, rather than carrying an extra replacement battery for long trips.  It's great that it saves money on batteries, but the internal battery dies before the camera is filled with pictures and before trips are over.

I originally bought it for my wife to use (thinking it would replace a larger point and shoot what had too-easily changeable setting controls) in the silver color (the only color she liked since it didn't come in black), but when she used it, she said that all the corners were too rounded and it felt too slippery for her.

It looks great but takes horrible pictures. Every single one is blurry and as other reviews have pointed out, it is slow to take the pic so you lose the good shot you wanted. The flash operates randomly...I have it set to auto and it will not flash in a completely dark room. Only operates if you set it to fill flash for every pic. Most pics have the subjects eyes closed, blurry and any lights in view have streaming tails. I would say one out of every 20 pics taken are remotely acceptable. Makes a good gift to a 2 year old I suppose. I'll stick with my Sony Cybershot which takes picture 110% better than this little toy. An iPhone takes better pics by far.***UPDATE***I took it back to the store where it was purchased and exchanged it for another silver S01 today. The new one one takes better pics, not blurred like the others. But the flash still does not function well. I would say the first one I had was defective. The pics are a huge improvement, therefore I am giving it 3 stars instead of the original one star.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Defective camera", "Author": "R.

The size is awesomely amazing.  You can stick this sucker in any pocket, even in the pocket of your tight jeans. Other than the size this camera is really just terrible. I am surprised by all the glowing reviews for this camera and wonder if those people are just used to taking crappy photos all the time. I got this camera for Christmas and have already returned it for a Canon Elph, which isn't much bigger and is vastly better at the same price. I have taken much better photos with my cameraphone (an old Blackberry Storm 2) than I managed to capture with this camera.I made sure this was the first gift I opened on Christmas morning so that I could use it to take photos of the festivities. These are the discoveries I made about the picture quality with the S01:1) Tiny flash = bad lighting. Unless your subject is exactly 3.5 - 4.5 feet away from you the flash is not strong enough to illuminate them. Any closer than 3.5 feet and they will be lit up like the sun; totally overexposed.2) Slow flash reaction. This is one of those cameras that has the crazy flash that I think is supposed to eliminate red eyes but it takes a million years to actually flash so by the time the shutter works the subject is no longer posing. It is utterly frustrating for the photographer as well as the people that are in the photo because a 'preflash' illuminates and the subject will think the photo has been taken when it will actually go off 5 to 10 seconds later. I have been told that if you hit the shutter button half way down to focus without releasing than take the photo the slow flash won't occur, but I had already returned the S01 before I had a chance to test that out.3) Subject must be still. If your subject moves at all the image will be blurred.  This camera cannot freeze movement.4) Despite the slow flash most subjects had red eyes. Big glowing red eyes. I did get one cool shot of my 2 year old niece that looks very similar to a young Damien. Extremely evil.Nearly all the photos I took were indoors in a well lighted room yet many of the photos are dark, yellow/orangish tinted, grainy, or overexposed. I took approximately 65 shots and got maybe two decent photos.  It was very dissapointing that I relied on this camera for all my Christmas day photos. I did take two photos at night of the full moon, which for some reason actually turned out better than photos I have taken of the moon with my Nikon SLR.So in conclusion; if all you care about is the size of your camera with no concern for picture quality, by all means this is the camera for you. Otherwise, you will quickly be sorry you purchased this little camera.
