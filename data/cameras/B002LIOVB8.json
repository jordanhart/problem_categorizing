Do not waste your money on this piece of junk!  They were cheap so I got three of them to try.  I was excited that they did send three different sensor / receiver channel combinations.  However the results were: 1 - worked fine but goes thru batteries quickly, 1 - never stopped going off as soon as you turned it on - even with that sensor without a  battery, 1 - never goes off even if you test it inside the house four feet from the receiver.  So if you are just looking for a \"doorbell\" for your driveway that may or may not work at any given time (or may not work at all) - go for it.  If you are looking for a reliable system to notify you of traffic or movement don't bother.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Driveway Patrol", "Author": "Burton R.

She'd frequently saw them walking away, or saw signs that they had been there, and knew that she'd missed her chance to feed them.  This alarm solved the problem... it detects their prescence immediately, and she goes right out and feeds them.  She considers it one of the best presents she ever got.  She turns the receiver off at her bedtime.One thing.. it can be set off by things blown past it due to the wind (clumps of leaves, etc.)", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Garage/Driveway Monitor", "Author": "Mark Raymond", "ReviewID": "REVJLC7LEM1FQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have had some kids or whoever coming into garages in our neighborhood recently and removing bicycles and other things right in daylight.

I bought 3 of the Trademark 82-3731, and when received, one would not work and was sent back.  All three had different channels which was great. I mount one to detect traffic on my north drive and one on my south drive.  However, sometime the one on the south drive will start beeping for no reason at all and we have to turn it off for awhile.  When turned back on, it is ok.  When it is working, it works great, and with two different channels, we know if we have activity on the south or north drive.
