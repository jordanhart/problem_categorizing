Other reviews on net generally like the camera but think price is somewhat high and 12 MP is overkill. A) It is expensive; all new camera models are high for several months when they come out. If you can afford it without problem then you get it now. Otherwise your choice is perhaps the SD850 at $150 less or waiting a while for price drop.  B) The same overkill thing was said when 5 MP, 6 MP, .... became widely available. 12, 8, 5, and lower MP settings are readily available without entering menu. I set mine on 8 MP and, if desired, will change to 12 MP if the thought occurs for special pics. Now that you can order poster sized prints for cheap prices on Shutterfly and SnapFish you'd be amazed by the ease, cost and quality of them. Also hard drive space has gotten cheap and you could keep 1000's of 12 MP files on $20 worth of hard drive space now.The other reviews have it right on the quality of the camera and its results. The photos are sharp, color accurate and, in Manual mode, have many SLR, non-auto type choices such as WB, exposure setting, shutter speed (long exposure) setting, color accent, focus lock, .....; The movie setting is simple to use, gives you choice of HD (15 fps, sl. jerky at rapid movement but with quality sharpness or 30 fps standard). Easy to import into iMovie without added Canon software (don't know about PC ease). Manual is logical though 220 pages in English. Has few errors, particularly for long shutter speed it states pressing \"menu\" but should read \"disp.\" Finally, I dumped my Olympus Stylus 750 because I absolutely could not take photos outside on sunny days due to LCD washout and NO VIEWFINDER. Before getting the Olympus, I had read on their site that the LCD was \"bright\" with new technology that would not wash out. That's why I did not consider the SD700, 800, 1000, ... which have no viewfinder. That said, the 950 LCD really works well outside though I've only used it a couple times outside thus far.", "Date": "October 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Impressed by the quality", "Author": "Dock", "ReviewID": "RS8J4NSE11CHE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not too much into the digital camera world but I bought this one for my wife who previously owned a Sony DSC P100. After reviewing several web sites, especially one that only compares different pictures in different situations for a lot of cameras, the SD950 was the one that gave overall the best pictures. At least the review was not biaised by the impressions and subjectivity of the reviewer, just pictures taken by digital cameras.I was first tempted by a Panasonic DCM-TZ3 which has on paper better specs. However, shots in low light are disappointing for the Pana and the flash is awful, the pictures taken are not at all balanced.So to come back to the Canon Powershot SD 950 (Or Ixus 960 I believe, depending on your country):=> I was first impressed by the quality that you feel when you open the box, presumably because of the titanium; but at this level of price, this is normal!=> This is a very intuitive camera, the ergonomy is good: it is true that the on/off button is close to the shutter button but it was the same with the Sony: all it takes is a bit of habit. Also the movie mode is very easy to use, much easier than with the Sony. You can also basically post edit your film with the supplied software.=> The pictures taken are great, I will not post some here, you can go to flickr. The 12MP can be a drawback, especially if you upload a lot of pictures but of course you can set-up your camera to take only 8MP pictures for instance.=> The lens is bright for a point and shoot and the numeric noise is well mastered, even in low light conditions.=> The Image Stabilizing feature works very well, Canon used here an optical solution, which is much, much better than a numeric IS found on cheaper cameras.=> The camera is quick, not only to power on but also between shots. I was a bit afraid because I ordered a regular Kingston 2GB but even set at 12MP, this is not longer than the Sony at 5MP; in other words even with a regular memory card (no \"extreme\" which are more expensive), the wait between the shots is satisfactory.Now the cons.=> I would have prefered more manual settings. You have a lot of programs (including macro, fireworks, aquarium, etc) that set the shutter speed and aperture for you but you cannot set these values yourself. It does not mean that you cannot set anything yourself, you can adjust the white balance, compensate the exposure, etc. but you would have liked to be able to set-up the aperture and/or the speed, especially if you owned a SLR before.=> With the big LCD screen, the battery life is only correct. I would encourage you, if you have some bucks left, to buy a second battery sold on Amazon as well.To summarize, except if you absolutely want to be able to control your point and shoot like a SLR, go for the SD950, you will not regret it!", "Date": "November 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nearly perfect compact point and shoot camera - and more!", "Author": "Middle age tech freak", "ReviewID": "R22GEQCX7KR5Z7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a Canon convert with this camera. I've had several small point and shoot cameras - this is hands-down the best I've owned. The previous one had some serious issues with the images, they were over-processed - detail was fuzzed out and there was nothing you could do about it. Some of the megapixel race cameras (that was 10mp) have issues because of that in-camera processing. This Canon has absolutely excellent quality images, and the camera is everything I could hope for in a camera this size. I'm amazed how well the SD950 captures the essence of light - previous cameras have been a compromise but this camera captures sunsets, clouds, vegetation, people with life-like colors. The face recognition technology makes amazingly good people shots. I like the tiny format for being able to take it with me all the time - I can bring my DSLR on planned outings, but the little Canon is always ready.I have pretty big hands and this camera is easy for me to grip and handle - other reviews noted this and they are absolutely correct. It looks sleek and smooth, but it's nearly perfect in terms of gripping it and controlling it.All-in-all, this seems to be the nearly perfect shirt pocket point and shoot camera!Pros:Pocketable, viewfinder (small but better than not having one), bright and wide view LCD display, intuitive simple controls, nice telephoto zoom, image stabilization, easy menu operation, automatic modes almost always capture what you want, excellent - especially for a 12mp camera - images, superb movie mode, decent album and editing software, easy downloading.Cons:Limited manual operation, while shooting, thumb can open battery door if you're not careful, USB door barely opens enough to get plug in.", "Date": "January 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "C.

To my amazement, the result was just the opposite.  The detail, sharpness, clarity and color in the photos taken with the SD950IS were noticeably better.

I finally found it 2 years ago with the Canon EOS 5D, a full-frame 12.3 megapixel DSLR. Recently, I decided to see if I could find a compact that even came close to the 5D. Well, guess what? Here it is. Aside from the 5D, this is the best camera I have ever used. Hands down the image quality is as superb as it comes...smooth, crisp, well exposed, and clean. I now have a take-anywhere to just throw in my pocket when the 5D would be overkill. Trust me when I say that this camera will be a legend. It is that good. In fact, I'll likely pick up another one when its succcesor comes out and the price drops.UPDATE: After using my SD 950 IS for few weeks, it is clearly not anything near a Canon 5D. Although there are a lot of pixels, the 950's resolving power simply can't compete with a Canon L-class lens. No surprise of course but don't expect pro quality just because you have 12 megapixels. I still love the SD 950 IS for what it is but make no mistake about what it isn't.", "Date": "January 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Pocket Camera", "Author": "D. Sun", "ReviewID": "R7LIKDLJWOWZ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My former digital camera is a Nikon 4500 that was 6 years old, cost $700+, and is still working. The Canon was a major jump in MP count, size reduction, SDHC storage, and convenience. 12MP really is overkill in many cases. It produces image files from 2-6+ MB, which takes up a large amount of storage and has such detail that you can zoom and crop, but how many of us will take advantage of this on a regular basis?Even with image stabilization I've had a few shots come out blurry, even though I hold and take the photo as if there is no stabilization. There is no full manual mode , however there are several pre-set modes for different settings and events. The aiaf-artificially intelligent auto focus as well as the 'face detection,' mode of autofocus are also spotty and will focus on some very strange spots at times, which requires you to refocus or reframe the shot.The unit itself is small, light, well constructed. The only part that seems poorly thought out is the cover for the mini-usb and headphones ports. Hard to get open and awkward.Controls are very intuitive and well placed. Menu system is simple with easy navigation. The camera turns on fast and also has a fast auto focus. The LCD is large, clear, bright, and very nice.Being able to use the camera to take video that is limited to 1 hour is also a nice feature. Perfect for capturing short clips, events, scenery, etc.After researching, reading reviews, etc., the only major concern is the motor used to drive the lens assembly. There are people who have this drive fail, rendering the camera useless and Canon has not admitted to any defect or fixed the issue, but it could be a limited concern.Overall this is a great pocket camera. Some of the drawbacks, such as no true manual mode are not really legitimate, since this camera is not exactly a digital SLR, but it does serve the needs and purpose for which it is designed.", "Date": "January 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best SD Yet!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Christian\"", "ReviewID": "R6V1GVFUKU3AU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third Canon SD, and it's the best by far.

I really loved that camera at the time but this new one is simply amazing.  Each camera in the line has been a step up, although basically it's the same camera.  You don't have a learning curve with each new one.12.1 Mega Pixels!  It takes a hefty SD card to get plenty of photos, but you can now get an 8MP SD size for under $50.00.  Even with a 4GB SD card, you get around 750 images at top resolution.  This is all the resolution you will probably ever need.  You'll be able to enlarge to poster size or crop areas with excellent results.  But remember that for your average photos, you really don't need this much resolution.  I had a Digital Elph which was 7.1MP for years and it was more than enough.  There are 8.0MP Elphs available that you'll be extremely pleased with.  This camera is for people who know who they are.Plus, the camera has all the bells and whistles that you've come to expect (just check out the Canon ad on Amazon's website):  1,600 ASA, face detection autofocus, 2.5\" screen (plus a viewfinder), pretty high resolution movies with mono sound.Whether this is your first Digital Elph or an upgrade, you won't be disappointed:  Beautiful color, high resolution and accurate auto focus, automatic lens cover, image stabilizer, decent zoom and made from a single sheet of Titanium.  You'll just enjoy holding it.I also have the Canon Digital Rebel XTi SLR and that's a magnificent camera but who wants to carry that around on a trip?  This thing fits in your purse or pocket or in an optional case that slips into your belt.Certainly Canon will further upgrade this highly successful line, but I know that I'll be happy with this one for years to come.

So whether this is the camera for you depends on how you plan to use it.Good Points: It's attractive and takes good shots in full outdoor light. Has just enough manual adjustments to give you some flexibility, though it's really a P&S; no matter what. Power up time is relatively quick, though not instantaneous enough to capture a fast-moving toddler.Not-So-Good Points: this camera is surprisingly bad indoors. If you use the flash, it will give you clear shots, though you'll end up with photos that have a very bright subject and dark backgrounds - the kind you used to get with those Kodak disposable cameras. Should be better than that for a camera at this price. Plus, when you use the flash, there is a 1-2 second delay before the shutter clicks while the camera charges up the flash.If you do not use the flash, you are likely to get a lot of blurry shots. I tried it in our dining room on a sunny afternoon with plenty of natural light. Even with ISO set to 400, the camera \"shake\" indicator lit up, alerting me that it would be blurry - which it was. This happens even with the Image Stabilization turned on. One look at the exposure tells you why: 2.8f at 1/15! By comparison, my Canon 5D with a 50mm 1.4f lens registered the exact same shot at 4f and 1/250.Another irritation is the USB port door, which doesn't seem to open far enough to allow you to easily insert the cable. Also, the door is attached by a single, flimsy plastic tab that seems certain to snap off before too long. Apparently this is an ongoing problem with the whole line (based on what I've read in other reviews).Bottom line: great camera for tossing into a bag on an outdoor vacation.

Great since both of our kids are in sports. She used to have to guess 5 seconds before her daughter hit a ball or 5 second before my son poll vaulted over the bar or 5 second before my son took down another wrestler... It was maddening!I would suggest getting the SanDisk 4 GB Extreme III SDHC Card with MicroMate USB 2.0 Reader (SDSDRX3-4096-A21, Retail Package) San Disk 4 GB Extreme III. Your pictures at 12mp are going to be large and you need 4 Gb to take 100 photos. It is extreme on the data transfer so you can click, click, click and not wait for the transfers to happen. Plus, it has a USB reader included so if you are somewhere that doesn't read SanDisk cards, you have a USB solution.[The next chapter]The camera died! 1 year out of warranty and it died. I researched and found that this model has a recall because of a screw that can come loose. The screw is magnetized so it won't bounce around if it does come loose. In other words... You cannot shake the camera and hear it. What does happen is that the camera without warning closed up and goes silent.I sent them an Email and they sent me back a shipping label for UPS ground. Sent it in and they repaired it for free. They never said what was wrong so I don't know if it was the screw or if they were trying to avoid having lots of negative press.

When in bright light it's nice to have when the LCD screen is hard to see. The image in the viewfinder is very small and a little hard to see because it is so small, but most point and shoot cameras don't have any.-The movies are as good, motion jpg, like most P&S; cameras, they are good quality, but fairly low resolution. Some new manufacturers are using DviX and they are really nice. (both use AVI file types)-It is very nice that the lens retracts while you're in the mode for viewing your photos, saving battery power. Battery only lasts a few days with minimal use, but I think it's about standard for these higher resolution cameras.-It may be a little thing, but I like the wrist strap it comes with. It's wound like a rope instead of flat, so it holds up better and doesn't shred apart, and it has a plastic slide to tighten it around your wrist, a feature I really like (chasing a one year old around with the camera).-It comes on really fast, the zoom is steady but everything goes out of focus the second you start to zoom (on the LCD screen, the viewfinder seems to be better focus, but hard to see because the image is so small).-It takes good quality pictures and the color is good. As good an any compact I've used.Cons--The simple options (things you can get to with buttons without having to go into the menu options) are limited: flash, even on manual mode, are limited: on off and auto, no soft focus, if you want red eye you have to go into the menu, etc; shot modes, there is macro but no super macro. My Older Pentax, for example, has about 2 to 3 times the number of options.--The body is a little heavier and larger than many other manufacturers--LCD screen is really small. The compact point and shoot with the large LCD is really nice for showing off photos in the photo view mode--When you zoom, everything is out of focus until you depress the button to take the photo, so you don't have any idea what you're going to get. You can wait for the image to focus before depressing all the way, but it takes a long time sometimes.--It doesn't have a non compressed file format, like RAW or TIFF so you really need to be careful to save your original, unedited shots. Even rotating them can reduce quality in the compressed jpg format.--It is a little higher priced than some of the other cameras in it's category. The Pentax A40 12MP is $100 less and there are several Kodak 12MP cameras for under $200.Because of the high resolution, I'd suggest a really fast SD card because the standard 2mb read/write time is WAY too slow. The difference is waiting several seconds for a photo to write vs having it write immediately. If you want it right away (like I did), you pay top dollar.I'm sure it will come down in a short time. When I bought my Pentax A30, less than a year ago, I paid $360 and now it's $180. It started going down within a month. I guess that's expected with most electronics.All in all, it's a good camera, it got high ratings in the reviews (about 7/10)and I have canon cameras that are nearly a decade old that still work, so I'm guessing this will hold up well too.", "Date": "April 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awsome picture quality", "Author": "Doctor RSA", "ReviewID": "R1GHPWJ1NWY6B2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera 2 weeks ago.

I would have been satisfied with either, but chose the SD950IS for my particular usage primarily because of it will take 4000x3000 pixel images (12MP).  It should be noted you can also take smaller images with both cameras (8MP, 5MP, 2MP and 0.3MP for the SD950IS) which will allow putting more on the memory card (you will want to buy a separate memory card because the one that comes is only 32MB; I bought a 2GB which should store more than 300 images at the highest settings).  While the layout of the controls are slightly different on each camera, they are basically the same.I have not used the movie mode.The included software is pretty good, although it is not as extensive as the specialized photo software from Adobe.My main complaint is that it is very difficult to open the cover door to connect the camera to a computer to download the images, and someone with large fingers may not be able to do it easily.  Also that door is very flimsy and if not handled carefully might break off.Plan to read and study the entire User's Manual to get the full benefits of this camera.  Canon makes good products.While I found other stores advertising the SD950IS for a significantly lower price than Amazon, when I called them and tried to order it, I was told it would be 4-6 weeks even though their web site said it was \"in stock\".

I was originally thinking of bringing a DSLR with a zoom lens (17-55) because of the amazing photo opportunities but decided not to because it can get cumbersome to have to carry. So I settled for the Canon PowerShot SD950, mainly because I wanted more pixels than the 7.1 MP PowerShot model I currently had (and still love) and I needed the IS (image stabilization) and higher ISO features since I knew I would be taking a lot of Church interiors. I'm a big art buff and of course, Rome is home to the best Baroque art and architecture around -- and a lot of them are showcased inside dimly lit churches.I expected good results, but WOW was I blown away when I started using the camera indoors. I never use flash or the auto settings since they both kill the \"reality\" of the scene. Instead, I set the ISO to 400 and relied on hand-held photos so I could capture what I saw indoors, and the results I got were consistently remarkable. Sure, I would shoot 3 or 4 of the same scene and select the sharpest, but consistently, the array of images were sharp, colors excellent and exposure very good. My expectations were far exceeded.Of course, the results outdoors were equally impressive. Again, I used the manual setting and because we had beautiful sunny weather, I stopped the camera down 2/3 to compensate for the brightness. The 12.1 MP images are astounding. With images this large, you can crop later too and not worry about image degradation.Again, a very versatile, compact device that captures images amazingly well in many conditions, including indoors using ambient light.

I looked at photos posted on the review sites and on enthusiast websites.  I own a Nikon DSLR which takes excellent photos, but it is too expensive and bulky for the majority of shooting occasions.  I love to capture those memorable spontaneous moments that can only be taken with a small, fast pocket sized camera, but I am not willing to accept poor quality photos to achieve this goal.After using the Canon SD950 camera for about a month, it is clear that it will be my primary camera.  It takes crisp clear quality shots very quickly, from power on and frame to frame, subject to subject.  The built-in features are impressive, even compared with my DSLR, although I doubt I use some of the more esoteric functions.  I sometimes miss the lack of complete manual shutter/aperture control, but I remind myself what the purpose of this camera is.I consider this a high end point and shoot, quality built and semi-rugged, that takes really impressive photos for its size.  It feels solid and pleasant to hold and control, and the display is sharp, bright, and anti-glare coated.  The basic controls are simple, and I have found the movie mode to be much more enjoyable and useful than I had thought it would be.  It really takes nice looking 480p movies, and doesn't seem to have any problem with over 10 minutes of continuous shooting on the Sandisk Extreme 4 Gb memory card I installed.  Once again, I have a dedicated video camera that is capable of better video quality, but if I want a quick spontaneous movie with the Canon, it is ready to go and surprisingly nice viewing.

Some notable points:=> 12 megapixels is not necessary for printing standard 3x5 snapshots, but there are an increasing number of companies (such as ShutterFly) which create projects such as calendars storybooks from your prints. The extra megapixels definitely come in handy when doing projects like these.=> The titanium shell is not a gimmick! I dropped this camera off a pickup truck and it landed on a concrete road. I thought it would be busted for sure, but it wasn't even scratched!=> Image stabilization is not a gimmick! In my experiments, image stabilization is crucial for low-light photography because it allows me to quarter my shutter speed and take clear pictures with 75% less light.=> I needed to perform warranty repairs because a black spot was appearing in all of my photos. I'm unsure if it had anything to do with the incident described above. Despite the fact that the damage may have been due to dropping and the serial number had rubbed off, Canon replaced the optics and sent it back to me for no charge. The repair experience was pleasant and I will remember this when I buy my next camera.=> With 12 megapixels, digital cameras are now capturing as much detail as film cameras. My experiments revealed that the amount of detail in the images is comparable to 200 speed APS film or 400 speed 35mm film.=> Although daytime images look great, pictures taken in low-light conditions suffer. If you're in flash range, the flash is accurately exposed (unlike a Sony digital camera that I used), but flash or no flash, focusing in the dark is slow and inaccurate. This will be a problem with any compact digital camera.=> Movies are acceptable, but the files are very large because they lack the MPEG compression capabilities of Sony cameras. It is difficult to compress the files later because of the MJPEG compression previously applied.

The camera is much bigger than the SD500 that I upgraded from--even though it's got so many bells and whistles.  One thing about Canon that's got my eyebrow raised:  Why the big font as if we can't read?The Image Stabilization is a wonderful thing, right along with the face detection.  It even focused on an enlarged print of a little girl!  The 3.7 zoom is nothing to frown at either.  ISO is easier to set now so one can play around with the settings...The camera is made for \"big hands\" and it took me about two weeks of off and on shooting to get used to it.  The 12MP quality is okay, and I didn't have to get used to too much new button placement.  One thing I didn't like is the play button.  I felt I had to really push my finger on the play button in order to view my photos.  It annoyed me enough to see what else was out there.The Canons SD770 and SD790 were next on my list.  Even though they were \"only\" 10MP, they had newer technology from Canon:  Motion Detection and Infinity and cute buttons in all new small packages.SD770IS(Silver)First the SD770.  This was a nice small camera!  Not cheap feeling at all, Canon packed everything but the kitchen sink in there.  I like the \"Infinity\" setting that the SD950 didn't have.  Also, I have the silver version and it's nice, small, sleek, and takes great pictures.  I didn't like the way the battery cover was not spring loaded.  Also, either it was this particular camera or the 770 in general, but it seemed like I had to \"dig\" for the battery and SDHC card once put in.  Yes, it's compact, hefty, and full of bells and whistles, but it was...kinda boring.  Maybe because the silver color didn't have the pizazz of the black version that I'd read reviews on.  Moving on to the SD790...SD790ISBigger camera!  Compared to the 770, it's a giant!  The same size as the 950 except in a square/cube like form.  The 950 is curvy, while the 790 is sleek and boxy (not sure if that's an oxymoron or not!).  The 790 also has a new button format that I'm not sure if I like or not.  I really enjoyed the SD500's button placement and while I can appreciate a \"play\" button...why not make it easy access instead of having to constantly press the button down?  I'm thinking that the play buttons will eventually wear out.  The big screen is nice, and even though I haven't used a viewfinder since...ever, it would be nice to \"just have\".  So the lack of a viewfinder is a potential bummer.  You never know when you gotta smear your nose on the photo screen to take pic!  lol  Also, the 790 is a fingerprint magnet.I tried to take the same pictures with all the cameras, but couldn't always (morning/evening, different zoom, etc.).  Both the 770 and 790 have high ISO settings (as did the 950), but I didn't even use anything that high previously!  All the pictures came out great.  Even my crappy pictures of my messy coffee table were clear and colorful!  One issue I had with all three cameras was the color accent setting.  It seemed as if I got better black and white/one color photos from my SD500 than either of these cameras.  I have to do a lot more tweaking.  However, it could be just because of the balances of the colors and the lighting effects in my environment.If I just had to choose based on portability, photos, looks, bells/whistles, ease of use, I would go crazy trying to decide.  Both cameras are amazingly small!  The thing that keeps me wondering about the 770 is, \"how can they fit all these specs in this TINY camera!??  But, I'm a sucker for good looks, so the scale points back to the SD790!  True it's bigger than the 770, but it's still small considering the screen.  I always take great care of my electronics, so I'm not so worried about fingerprints.  If the button issue upsets me extremely, then I'll just upgrade to Canon's latest and greatest in 6-8 months.One more thing:  I purchased the SanDisk 4 GB Extreme III SDHC Card w/ MicroMate USB Reader and it gets 900ish pictures on the 10MP versions at the highest settings.Either way, can't wait to take pics on the new SD790.

Sandell \"sharonINchicago\"", "ReviewID": "R1KR7F4F19UFTT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I owned the first digital camera Sony made (unfortunately it had limited internal storage and media cards had not yet been invented, transferred photos only through infrared port, and it cost twice as much as this Canon), then the Sony Mavica 400 (which cost $1000 and had to be sent back for repairs almost immediately), and a 4.0 megapixel Mustek (which has never taken good photos).  This Canon PowerShot SD950IS blows the rest out of the water in ease of use, quality of photographs, size and offers several ways to download the photographs.  I found out by accident that it works well with my Brother wireless printer, too.  I was amazed to see the 15X total zoom, which was much easier to use than any of my previous digital cameras.  The only drawback I have found is that one cannot take photos with the LCD screen turned off.  I expected that a camera equipped with a viewfinder would allow me to take photos using the viewfinder only, but I was wrong.  Canon should correct this as there are several instances where you would not want the LCD screen to light up when taking photographs--why else put a viewfinder on a camera?  I have been very disappointed with Sony because they drop product support almost as soon as they stop making a particular model.  For instance, the Mavica CD disks are no longer sold and they never upgraded the software for my first Sony beyond Windows 95.  I will be curious to see what Canon does with product support when this camera model is no longer being manufactured.  It was the main reason I decided not to buy another Sony.  I will say that the Canon works well with WindowsME, Windows XP, and Vista.  Having bought a now useless Sony photo printer with my first Sony camera, I will not purchase any photo printers again--the photos print very well with regular ink jet printers.", "Date": "March 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Have had this camera for 14 months, suddenly dead!!", "Author": "Riff", "ReviewID": "R1A38VKE3LU7SI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is great, but suddenly today it stopped for no reason.

It is a very comfortable camera to hold and the buttons are easy to find and reach, not in the way. It takes very clear pictures, although if you are using it for any nighttime shooting I would recommend using a tripod because it has a tendancy to want to blur more at night. I do wish that the macro setting was capable of a little more, but it still works well. Also the battery lasts for a long time between charges, though my view on this may be slightly skewed as the battery in my old camera wouldn't even last a day.The titanium casing on this camera is one of my favorite features because I tend to be very rough on my things. My camera has been dropped or squished a few times with no real ill effects. I've had it drop into a creek before while hiking around and after sticking it in my oven at 100 degrees F for an hour and then letting it air out for a couple of days it seems to work fine.

A photographer friend had suggested it to me for the quality and my budget. I got some really amazing shots with it. Some have commented on my Flickr assuming that they were DSLR.This camera lasted me until about 2010, when the lens got scratched, and the quality of the pictures just wasn't so great anymore. I made several inquiries about getting it repaired, but it would have cost more to repair it than to get a new camera, so Canon sent me a discounted upgrade in exchange for my camera. I got another Powershot, but can't even recall which one it was. The photo and video quality for that 'upgrade' was actually such a severe downgrade!!! But since I was stuck with that exchange, I went without a good camera until this year.I found the SD950IS from an independent seller here on amazon, and purchased it. They were right about the excellent condition. The camera cord was a little soiled/discolored from use, but the camera itself worked just as great as my old one. I HIGHLY recommend this camera if you want something smaller than a DSLR but don't want to sacrifice the quality.The only cons I should mention is that occasionally, this camera will take blurry pictures if there isn't enough lighting. Thankfully there is a nighttime setting, but this requires flash (of course). I personally hate having to switch to flash at dusk when I went to capture scenery. Sometimes you can up the brightness, which can aide in the event that you don't want to use flash or the nighttime setting just yet, but generally, you'll get that with any point and shoot. This has happened with most point and shoots I've had, but as far as cons go, this camera is a little more sensitive to darkness than others.However, overall, this is probably the best point and shoot camera I'll ever own, and I sincerely wish Canon still made this model of Powershot!!An additional tip that I want to mention--If any concert lovers choose to take this camera and record some video clips,you'll get pretty excellent sound... not the crumby kind you'll get from most camera phones and other point and shoots with video capability. You can easily record an entire track with great sound and pretty decent video quality, with the ability to adjust the zoom while recording.", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product!", "Author": "Greg Chen", "ReviewID": "R44699V1BDTOS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "How I loved this camera; too bad we couldn't find replacement parts at reasonable prices when it fell.

Understandably I have never had one last more than 2 years and it is not uncommon for them to look like they have been through a cement mixer by the time they are exhausted and replaced. My camera is with me 24/7; I would give up my cellphone before I would my camera. This is the most durable camera I have ever owned.My cameras are not just intended to capture precious memories; when I purchase a camera I have two objectives in mind: it has to take decent photos; the wife and I love to travel and we take gazillions of pictures when doing so, plus it has to be sturdy. My cameras are not only used for our pleasure trips, but also as a note pad for reminding me of items I want to research; I am in a store, see a item of interest I want to know more about, I take a pic for reference later. Or I am driving, a song I like comes on the Sat. radio, I take a pic of the screen and look it up later at home. As well, while at work I used it while under machines to read a part number - take a pic, zoom in the image, write down the number, order the part. If a machines cycle was erratic, video the sequence, and email the file to tech support.  I take pictures of clouds, a sunrise or sunset while driving, animals along the road, cars, buildings, people, on and on. I have taken many many thousands of photos - just at Walt Disney World alone - with this camera and it has never had a single issue where it would not start up even after repeated bounces off concrete floors.As durable as this camera is though it still has one vulnerability. The environment where I used to work, a lumber and Mil work company, was very dusty and that, along with always being in my pocket, caused after a while little particles to began to make their way into parts of the camera. At first it was not really a issue, but a few months ago it was really beginning to affect some of my photos. When I zoomed in I would have small 'shadow' dots on the images where light was being blocked by saw dust, lint, and such. I brought the camera to a local camera shop that still does repairs for what I figured would be a simple cleaning only to find that for this type of job it had to go back to Canon. As you probrobly have read, that costs a flat fee of about $170.00. The thought of paying that much for a cleaning does sound crazy, but thinking about it; how great this camera has performed and the cost of an equivelent replacement, which since the 2 year mark as up I was prepared tp do, I decided to go for it. About 10 days later I was back at the store to retrieve the camera.The camera I picked up looked a whole lot different than the one that came back - with one funny exception. The camera I gave them was certainly solid and in one piece; believe it our not there was not a dent on the titanium body even after 2 brutal years. There were scuff marks all over it for sure; in fact the protective layer over the LCD was so scuffed up it almost looked like a cat used it for a scratching post, and none of the white silk screened printing identifying the make, model, etc remained at all.The store owner, reading the repair slip that came back with the camera, told me that Canon did not clean the lens, instead they replaced the entire lens component, as well as the viewfinder, the flash, the protective cover over the LCD, & the zoom control switch, they re calibrated it to factory specs ~AND~ finished it up by replacing the entire outer body of the camera (this Titanium body has no SN#). With the exception of one thing it looks like a brand new camera. The one thing they did not replace? The grungy, ratty wrist strap - but I'm not complaining.That, without a doubt, was worth the $170.00 to me.So, now you know it is a durable camera, but hey, a brick is pretty durable too but it takes crummy pictures. This camera takes beautiful photos - better out doors than indoors, but there are enough manual functions you can tweak to compensate, and the videos are awesome as well.A number of reviews I have read speak about blurry photos shooting in low light environments. There are a couple ways I find that you can compensate. Certainly a tripod helps, but when I am spending 8 hours wandering around Walt Disney World I have no desire to carry a full size tripod. I will however make use of any fence post, garbage can, or any other solid stationary object I can find to rest the camera on, sometimes in conjunction with one of those tiny pocket size tripods. .I then make some tweaks on the camera; most of my photos are taken in manual mode; rarely do I use Auto. A nice feature on this camera is that you can set the print button for another function as well - I use it to adjust the light sensitivity adjustment. After I have the camera setting on whatever I am using as a base I switch the camera to timer mode and then knock down the sensitivity a couple notches. This is an important step when you are taking photos of photos of things like colorfully lit buildings at night. The camera will want to open its aperture all the way to get as much light as long as possible which gives you yucky photos - the colored lights are washed out and the whole image has a greyness about it. By reducing the exposure setting you will get a more natural look. To avoid getting the blurriness or streaking of the lights, use the self timer function. With the camera on a stable base set the timer, press the shutter control, and let go. And for crying out loud, unless you are attempting to shoot a person standing right in front of you, shut off the flash, it is only working against you landscape shots.Which brings me to another thing. The flash distance on this camera is slightly better than most point and shoot cameras, but it really has its limits. I frequently am taking photos in a room that is cavernous and not very brightly lit. In Auto mode if my subject id fairly close they may be fairly well lit, but you can not make out any of the details of the room they are standing in. Canon does have a excellent flash attachment you can buy, it is not cheap but I am told works very well; now that my 950 is working so well again I plan on getting one. Look for the Canon HF-DC1 High Power Flash. Until you get one you can tweak your exposure a bit pretty well this way. With the camera in Manual mode set the ISO to 400 and the flash set to on. What will happen is your subject will be brightly lit - you may have to practice a bit to find the sweet spot in distance from your subject to avoid washing them out - but your background will be a bit more defined as well. Yes the higher ISO setting will give you a more grainy image, so consider playing with increasing the exposure setting as well with a lower ISO setting. It is not a fix, but it helps you get something a little better.The great thing about digital cameras is the immediate feedback you get over older film cameras; with the price of high capacity memory cards as low as they are there is no reason to only take a handful of shots of your subject. This is a camera that lets you really play around and take some great images. I love using the sepia setting when filming landscapes like old barns in a field, even Niagara Falls (do a goggle search on: \"flickr kobolila niagra falls\"  to see some pics I have taken at the falls)One more note for the newbies - if you try shutting off your flash sometimes you might find it can actually give you a better picture. When you are outside taking pics of a skyline, building or canyon flash is not only useless, but can actually work against you. if the flash reflects of a object closer than what you intend to capture that item will be well lit and what you are trying to get will be too dark to recognize. To the best of my knowledge no point and shoot camera has a flash that will reach 300 yards.When I thought that I might have to replace this camera with something else I had considered the Olympus cameras that are designed to be really tough, but the reviews on their video quality bothered me and I wanted to stick with a camera that used SD cards. I am glad I did not give up on my Canon 950. No camera has ever lasted me more than two years; they just could not take the abuse I put them through, but this one is already past that and eager to take more.", "Date": "May 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "good amateur camera", "Author": "Michael Tran \"Mike Tran\"", "ReviewID": "R27O2D4BB5EOKF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i'm sastified with this camera.It's fun and I can keep going to learn how to be a pro.", "Date": "May 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Its Okay", "Author": "B.

The 12MP really makes a difference, it's amazing how clear the pictures are. The camera does well in the dark as well, you just have to find the right setting. So for people complaining that this doesn't work in the dark, don't listen, mine works perfectly both in the dark and light. It also has some features that other cameras don't have, such as red eye reduction, and pictures in the dark come out really bright also due to an enhancing feature. I owned a sony before and I can say with certainty that this camera convinced me of the canon superiority. Also, I noticed a lot of people complained (rightly so) about the grainy pictures that other canon SD models take, well this one doesn't do that, the pictures are VERY clear. The only downside is that it does not have a battery indicator (well, it does, but it only tells you either when it's full or completely empty).  I was hesitant to buy this since it just came out, but I have been extremely impressed with the features and improvements over earlier (SD800, SD870) Canon models that I tried in the store.

And, the face sensor starts out cool but as soon as you go to actually take the picture it reduces down to one face. And, the dial on this...look closely as compared to the other new Powershot cameras easily turns.

Sure, you can zoom but really...with this type of camera...how big are you going to blow those pictures up...if your a pro - you will have a much better camera.Save the $$$ and go with something that takes good pics and if you want pro pics...invest it the technology.Now that I've written this...don't out bid me on ebay for that Powershot S70 - you'll see how good it is that even after it coming out in 2004 still fetches $300 on ebay - USED... back in 2004 I paid $500 for it...And, if you're reading this and are the person that took that Powershot S70 out of that bathroom in Ft.

If something isn't standing completly still then the pic blur's. For example my new born niece's were sitting in cribs. I went to take a pic and the camera has huge lag beofre taking, then Sofia moved her head to the left and all i got was a blurred pic. This has happend on more the 50% of my pics and it is upsetting. I had a canon before this one and it s=did the same thing. I figured for more money I would get rid of that problem, but nope. Also I hear this camera has a problem some \"E??\" error. I would check it out becaus eit is supposed to render the camera useless. So if you do buy this item well i wish you the best of luck.", "Date": "December 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "too much hype!", "Author": "Austin A.

I did a lot of reading reviews, since that's all I could do. they dont cary this camera in stores that you can check it out. I biught it to my sorprise, too much hype for nothing! I have a Canon S410 4mega pixels and it have the same features and the same quality pics! I am a Marine so I take pics of cool stuff on base and the camera its just a waste of money. If you want to have a nice looking camera this is the camera for you. I would sudgess to you to buy a S410 for 100 bucks insted of the 950", "Date": "December 16, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000WY5K1I"}}
