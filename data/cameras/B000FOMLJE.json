It's very inexpensive, so I knew there would be some concessions, but for me, it's still not worth the price (I paid $88 on sale).The LCD is extremely dark. In low-light(indoors, lamplight), I couldn't see anything at all. Images are only visible in very bright light, and even then appear a bit dim.There is a long lag time between snapping the picture and the image being available -- 5 or more seconds.Buttons are sometimes unresponsive -- both the on/off and the shutter.Photos are poor quality, even though they are 5 MP. Images are not crisp and flash is too bright for objects closer than 3 ft. Video is also poor quality.I would not recommend this camera to anyone.", "Date": "December 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "very good camera for the price!", "Author": "Justin Nichols", "ReviewID": "R1S6CP5SGLIBS7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I've had this camera for over 2 years.  I have never experienced any of the problems the other reviewers claim to have experienced.  Yes, it is a cheap camera, but for me the quality of the camera and pictures is great!  I have a better camera I use for some things, but i dont like taking an expensive camera to the beach, fishing on a boat, hunting in the woods, or any other place where i would likely ruin it.Dont let their reviews scare you away from this camera, its great for the price!", "Date": "April 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Little Digital For the Price", "Author": "Summer S. Wilson \"Collectonian\"", "ReviewID": "R1J6ARXWTXYVAH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After seeing the poor reviews below, I had to come review this Polaroid i532. I have had this camera for many years and have loved it! Despite what the others said, I have NEVER had any problems with responsiveness and I have always gotten great pictures from it. Check Flickr for the same user name here and you will found thousands of well done photos I have taken with this camera. It shoots well both indoors and out, does great close up text and small item pictures, and the video mode works fine for the camera size and price point. Though 5 MP is \"small\" by today's standards, for most casual photographers just wanting 4x6-8x10 pics and to share pictures online, that is more than enough. However, at its max resolution, this camera can produce smaller poster prints and images of good enough quality to go into a photo book I printed earlier this year. This was my second digital P&S;, with my first also being a Polaroid.Like any digital camera that uses AAs (its only minor flaw), it does drain them fast (especially on video mode), but this is easily dealt with by getting some rechargeable batteries. $10-20 investment for a charger and four batteries and you're good to go. It is a great sized camera, easily slipping into most shirt pockets, jackets, purses, etc. Considering how long I've had mine, and all its been through, it is also very durable. This is a great camera for anyone wanting a simple, easy to use point-and-shoot digital at an affordable cost. Highly recommended!", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "TERRIBLE! There are better units in this price range than the i532", "Author": "ezinteriordesign \"ezinteriordesign\"", "ReviewID": "R1AGOM03L6CX79", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Picked this up for $129, seemed like a good deal. Uses AA batteries and drains them fast!! After just a week of light use, the power button which obviously controls the zoom lens stopped powering off the camera and the unit got extremely hot. I tried swapping batteries a few times but still couldn't get the unit to turn off! I ended up just removing the SD card and returning the camera.The pics were blurry and distorted. Things looked great on the big lcd, but when I downloaded onto my computer and printed them, they looked awful. Shutter lag time was too long, and the flash washed out alot of pics that weren't that close up. Dark, grainy pics without the flash. Cheap, flimsy body, about the only thing I did like was the rubber \"skin\" for the camera, and that's all!!All in all, a horrible camera. After doing more research, look into the Canon A540 or Kodak C875, much better features, similiar price. I picked up the Kodak C875 for a bit more on Amazon (haven't gotten it yet). It has much better reviews, a metal case, 8.0 mp, and what seems to be much better image quality.My opinion? Pass on ANY polaroid digitial, let them stick to the instant market, and let the other mainstream camera companies make the digitals.Don't waste your money on the Polaroid i532, unless you want to return the unit.", "Date": "January 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "I really wanted to keep this refurbished camera but.....", "Author": "Honest Amazon Fan", "ReviewID": "R25SZBK1C9W401", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The company gone through Amazon was very fast in shipping and package very well. The power button was giving me problems, but they gave me no hassel and immediately gave my money back as soon as they found out it was not work properly. Of course, after I sent it back to them. I would purchase from them again, just because one camera did not work right does not mean it isn't a good product.
