Also, the mounting bracket greatly limits how you can mount this camera, but I did like the very easily accessible external zoom and focus controls. The nicest part about the controls was that you can adjust them by hand instead of needing a tool.I do think the inline joystick control for the on screen display is a little strange. How are you supposed to see the screen if you are mounting the camera outside of your house for a DVR that is inside? I ended up using the web interface of my DVR, my laptop, and my wireless network to check out the OSD settings of the camera. So I was perched on a ladder outside by the camera clicking the joystick control while watching the output on my laptop, not very safe if you ask me, and if you do not have all of the above (wireless network, laptop, DVR with a web interface)  then the joystick control is pretty much useless.InstallationInstallation was relatively easy since I was replacing an existing CCTV camera, installation was only a matter of drilling screw holes that matched the mounting bracket. After installation the picture itself was pretty impressive; in daylight this camera outperformed all of my other CCTV cameras, even one that cost twice as much. The instant it got dark however, the problems started.The Bad NewsAs soon as it was dark enough for the camera to switch to Black and White, the screen filled with static and was completely useless for monitoring purposes. For about 30 seconds at a time the picture would clear and be viewable, then it would go back to heavy static. At first I thought it was my DVR or possibly a setting in the camera, but after about an hr of fiddling with both the DVR and the camera I've concluded that its defective.I am sending this camera back as soon as possible and recommend everyone steer clear if they want a quality CCTV camera.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$79.95", "Features": "Effio-E platform 700 TV Line\nSony 1/3\" 700 TVL Effio Color CCD sensor\nTrue Day/Night feature with IR The infrared project distance is up to 35 meters (114 ft)\nBuilt-in powerful IR LED illuminator  Weatherproof (IP66 standard)\nLens: 2.8~12 mm Varifocal Adjustable Lens", "Name": "700TVL Day Night Outdoor Security Camera 1/3\" SONY Effio Color CCD Wide View Angle 2,8mm - 12mm Adjustable ZOOM Lens 42 Infrared LEDs 114 Feet IR Range for CCTV DVR Home Surveillance System", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UsZd0tCxL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004RCPOEO"}}
