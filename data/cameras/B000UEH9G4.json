I have a Nikon Coolpix5700, and I have to get it repaired, so in the interim I bought this camera. First off, I love it becuase it's pink! Second the time between pictures is the fastest I have yet to experience. It's even faster than my Nikon! The picture quality is great also. Though the quality is not as good as my Nikon, I knew that would be the case. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone! Just make sure you have batteries. I would have given this camera an absolute 10 except the battery life goes sooo quickly. In the past, I have had a Kodak Easyshare but I dont remember the model number. It was nothing compared to this camera. I have also had an HP camera, and I would choose this camera over all of the others I have previously had. I was originally planning to just sell this camera on ebay once I got my Nikon fixed, but I'm going to keep them both. I'm using this one for everyday use and keeping my Nikon to do the \"special\" pictures of my kids. I'm so happy I bought this camera!", "Date": "December 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Would be great, if it worked.", "Author": "VKFlair", "ReviewID": "RLL95RQHZX65D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after my old Kodak bit the dust.  Saw it on the Kodak Store for 79.99 and was thrilled, by the price and features.  It was cheaper than my old camera, but 5 megapixels instead of 4, had optical zoom, and a bunch of different settings.  I was sold!Not only did it take over a month to ship (this was the Kodak Store, not Amazon), but once I got it, I discovered it didn't work.  The camera is possessed.  Occasionally it will turn on and stay on, but typically as soon as the power button is pressed, it shuts itself right back off.  If it even turns on in the first place.This is exactly what happened to my last camera.I'm sending it back, and hopefully will receive a new/fixed camera, but my hopes are not high.You take your chances with this camera, and with Kodak products in general.  It's a great price, but remember you get what you pay for (and sometimes less).", "Date": "November 6, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Compact Digital Camera Compatible with Secure Digital Memory Card, Secure Digital High Capacity Card, MultiMediaCard (MMC)\nIncludes Battery Charger\n5.0MP for Clear Cropping and Printing up to 11x17\"\n2.4\" LCD Screen Features Image Rotate, Indoor/Outdoor Display for Sharper Images\n3x Optical Zoom for Snapshots and Vacation Photos; 5x Digital Zoom for Minor Cropping\nShooting Modes: Continuous Shooting (Burst), Infinity, Image Stabilization, Easy Mode, LCD Gridlines; 16MB Internal Memory Storage Capacity\n16 Scene Modes ; Still Shot Modes: Beach, Night Portrait, Night Scene, Snow, Fireworks, Child, Automatic Shooting Mode, Panorama Assist, Landscape, Flower, Blur Reduction, Candle, Stitch Assist, Portrait, High Sensitivity\nFeatures Half Second or Less Click to Capture, Kodak Color Science Chip, Sound, PictBridge Enabled, Kodak Perfect Touch Technology\nLens-Focus Features: Auto Focus, Automatic Focus Lock to Make Images Sharper\nAdditional Functions: Video Capture\nMovie Modes: Image Stabilization, MPEG Movie\nFlash Modes: Red-Eye Reduction, Auto On/Off\nBlack-and-White, Sepia Photo Effects\nFile Format Compatibility: JPEG File Format, MPEG4\nWhite Balance: Tungsten, Automatic, Fluorescent, Shade, Daylight for Adjusting Light\nAdditional Features: Ultra Thin\nAlso Includes USB Cable", "Name": "Kodak Easyshare C513 Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21xiJfKvRVL.jpg", "ProductID": "B000UEH9G4"}}
