{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Tiny Camera Produces Great Photos", "Author": "Israel Flores", "ReviewID": "R1W21AUPDKI8G1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a hard time deciding whether to get this Sony DSC-P7 or the Canon PowerShot S230 Digital Elph.  I was looking for a small 3.2 MP camera.  I know some friends who each own one of these two cameras.  They were nice enough to each let me borrow their cameras so I was able to fully play with them for a few days before I decided which one to buy.  Although the S230 does capture images a little bit sharper, the P7 captures color better.  The P7 has 3X optical zoom compared to the S230's 2X.  The P7 comes with an AC adapter, the S230 does not (the P7's battery is charged directly on the camera while you must remove the S230's battery to charge it on a seperate charger).  I found that the S230 often produced red-eye and the P7 seldom did (and seldom does).  Luckily, you can correct red-eye on your computer.  Still, I would rather have a camera that produces photos that require the least editing as possible.  I would rather spend my time taking pictures! I wanted a camera that would fit in my jean pockets and although the S230 is a little smaller, the P7 is nontheless a tiny camera.The quality of the MPEG movie clips with sound is great.  This feature, however would never replace my camcorder--but it is a nice feature to have when I do not want to lug around my Digital8 camcorder.  I also like the fact that the length of video capture time is only limited to the size of your Memory Stick.  If I am not mistaken, only with Sony cameras (and only with some Sony cameras) can you fill the memory up with only video footage.  Also, with the P7's Memory Stick, I am able to view and save photos directly onto my Clie organizer.The size of the included 16 mb Memory Stick is insufficient.  I purchased a 128 mb stick and am able to fit over 80 photos set at the camera's highest resolution mode.  The photo quality is great.  The photo quality is not as good as some (and only a select few) of the much larger 3.2 mp cameras out there but for such a small-sized camera, the P7 is one mean machine.  I also thought of getting the DSC-P9 instead (with identicle shell/dimensions and features).  After reviewing several samples of the P9 that a friend of mine owned, I found that it was not worth spending an extra $100 dollars for the extra 0.7 mega-pixels.  The P9 is listed as a 4 mp camera but is actually a 3.9 mp.  The image quality is not much different.  Overall, I highly recommend the Sony DSC-P7 to anyone looking for a small camera that is able to produce photos with stunning quality.  The metal shell also looks very sleek and attractive.  I am glad I chose the DSC-P7 as I am enjoying it some much.  I do recommend purchasing a larger capacity Memory Stick (at least a 64 mb) and maybe an extra battery.", "Date": "December 8, 2002"}, {"Title": "Premium Casual Photography", "Author": "Girard C. V. Dulay \"gadget geek\"", "ReviewID": "R1G3SB7CA1DJMV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sony DSC-P7 is a compact 3 Megapixel point-and-shoot camera for the casual photographer, with enough extra features and style to make it worth its higher-than-average price tag.  With 3 megapixels you'll be able to get very good prints up to even 8x10 inches.The P7 is part of a series of similarly-designed cameras, the P2 and P9, the P2 with 2 Megapixels and the P9 with 4 Megapixels.  In essence the P7 is really an update to Sony's previous compact model, the P5, which has the same maximum megapixels but has fewer features.  The P7 is comparable to the P71, a less compact budget model with the same maximum megapixels but with a plastic body and a feature missing.The P7 is really designed for the casual photographer.  It's small enough to keep in your pocket and well protected with an all-metal body.  It also offers the usual functions you'd expect, including zoom, timer mode, and auto focus.  Operation is simple because most of the settings, from focusing to white balance, can be set to automatic.  It even offers special modes for night shots and the hard-to-capture night portrait shots (night shots with both scenery and people are otherwise hard to get right without this mode).  Most of the time you'll get a good shot with everything on automatic, but it offers manual preset controls for white balance, exposure, and focus range when the situation calls for it.Advanced features include an AF illuminator, optical zoom, and movie recording with sound.  The AF illuminator fires a red light on a subject to get the proper level of exposure when shooting in dark areas, which does produce a better picture.  The 3x optical zoom makes it easier to capture pictures from far away without losing quality, which usually happens with cameras that only have digital zoom.  Movie recording lets you save 320x240 pixel movies, which isn't quite TV quality but close enough.  Importantly, it can record sound, which the P71 doesn't lacks.With all of these easy-to-use features crammed in a compact body, the P7 is easy to recommend even as a first camera.  Though the price tag is high, you get what you pay for in quality, features, and size.  For the budget-conscious, I would recommend the P71 because it has almost the same features and doesn't need expensive proprietary batteries, but for those who want to get the most reasonably priced 'premium' small camera, I highly recommend the P7.", "Date": "July 19, 2002"}, {"Title": "Best digital camera I've ever used", "Author": "nick", "ReviewID": "R2OB80KOB4IVPC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have previously used a Nikon Coolpix and Canon Digital ELPH.

Byrne", "ReviewID": "R2J4T9IID1UXJP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for my wife as a Christmas present.  I did alot of research and tried several brands and models before I decided to give her the Cybershot DSC P7.  One of the strong selling points for this camera was the ease of use.  The menu interface for the camera was easy and it made sense.  It's ergonomics are excellent, it is lightweight, and compact.  This camera is very forgiving and allows us to take almost flawless pictures regardless of the lighting situation we put it in.  The delay between when you press the button and when the picture is taken is minor, but it might be an issue when you're trying to capture an action shot (I normally pre focus by focusing on the subject and holding down the shutter button halfway and it works).  If you want a camera that captures action, you'd probably do better by sticking with the SLR cameras.The LCD screen is crisp, but you'll need to use the view finder on a bright sunny day.  The digital video is fair to below normal meaning you'd get better quality with a camcorder because the cybershot has a lower frames per second ratio, but it is nice to have the \"movie\" option in a camera.  With a 128MB stick you can record up to 5 to 6 minutes of footage at the highest resoulution.Other features are the multiburst mode (for your golf swing, etc.), night mode (use a tripod), white balance (snow or beach pictures), 10 second timer, multi and center focus, and a red eye reduction.We have noticed that our picture taking has increased 300 percent since we've started using the cybershot.  I would definitely recommend that you purchase the 128MB memory sticks. We can put about 80 to 90 pics on a 128MB stick depending on the resolution we choose.  Also buy an extra battery.This camera was designed for the average person, primarily the  point and shoot crowd so it may lack some of the manual and advanced settings professionals prefer.  Overall, it is a fun camera that is easy to use and I think that makes up for any advanced features it lacks.***Update*** 10-21-2003Still No problems with the camera.  Now that we've used it foralmost a year, we kind of wish that there were some lens accessories to increase the optical zoom.

I usually get about 1 and a half hours of battery life, which is plenty to fill up my 128mb memory stick.

When I decided that I wanted a digital camera it was important for me to get one that was small enough not to impede on my active lifestyle yet did not compromise on technical ability.  Sony's DSC P7 is the perfect mix.  I travel a lot internationally and so I just put it in my pants pocket and keep the charger in my luggage.  You can snap about 300-400 pictures before the battery dies.  The menu functions are very user friendly and allow you to highly customize the settings.There is also no compromise on other aspects.  The movie quality is not perfect but really good and the sound is excellent.  Another thing that is annoying about most digital cameras is how long it takes for the picture to snap.  With this one, it takes the picture as soon as you push the button.  This is also true with the movies.  I know on some digital cameras when you are done recording a movie you have to wait a while for it to \"save\" to the flash memory.  Not with this one; Sony seems to have gotten the right idea in that, flash memory should work in a flash.  The only problem I have with it is that sometimes in extremely low-light conditions when the flash is imperative, you have to wait about 6 seconds for the flash to build up.  But just to reiterate, this doesn't happen in the light.  The other cool thing is the memory stick.  You can get 512MB sticks and you can even buy generic ones (from the same company that makes them for Sony) at half the price Sony charges.  The picture quality is outstanding.  The user can select a variety of qualities along with visual effects such as B&W, etc...To recap: It responds quickly to user commands, picture quality is excellent, it's small & light, it's not that expensive, and the movies have excellent quality sound with very good video.Bottom Line:  I'm a tough customer but the Sony DSC7 gets 5-stars because it deserves it.", "Date": "December 21, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great pictures, poor battery life", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RYRJDWB7G43PY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I replaced my old Sony DSC-50 1.3MP camera for this one.  Clearly, the picture quality is better, and I really like the quality of the pictures in low light.  However, the battery is poor in my opinion.  I barely get 1/2 hour of battery life during sustained use.  My old Sony had an usually powerful battery.  I would fill up my memory stick long before the battery would run out.  I suspect the size of the battery is the reason.  My old camera used the same battery that is currently used to power their camcorders (M series).  This camera uses a very tiny battery, so it stands to reason it wouldn't last as long, but anyone buying this camera would do well to consider a 2nd battery.", "Date": "March 20, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "\"torpdude1\"", "ReviewID": "R26L6NZ65H6TY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much research and changing my mind several times, I finally decided to go with a compact camera.  I chose the P7 over the S230 because it was easier to hold while taking pictures.This camera is extremely easy to use.  Even my 5 year old son can use it and take adequate pictures.  The quality of the images has been excellent.  The outdoor pictures are truly incredible.  I have been in two low light situations and the camera has performed very well.  Like any point and shoot, the flash does have limited range.  Apparently there is an external flash available with this camera.  That might be a worthwhile consideration for events like weddings where you can't always be front and center.  The camera is very slim and fits easily in a coat or pant.  The LCD is very bright and clear, but because it is so small, it is often difficult to detect if the image is slightly out of focus.The battery life seems pretty good.  If you don't need the flash, I would guess that you could take pictures for the better part of the day, especially if you turn off the LCD.  With the flash and LCD on, I took about 85 pictures before the battery died out.  The charging of the battery is very convenient.  Because the power cord plugs directly into the camera, you can use the power cord to power up the camera if it is turned on or if the camera is off, then it will charge the battery.  The battery life remaining displayed in the LCD is also very useful.The 16mb memory stick that comes with the camera is woefully insufficient.  Plan on buying a larger memory stick.  I bought a 128mb Lexar memory stick ...  It works flawlessly with the camera.  I have installed the USB drivers that come with the software on both a Win98 system and an IMac OS9 and both handle the download/upload between camera and computer with ease.  I have not played with it too much, but the editing software seems kind of clumsy.  For making prints, I have been taking my memory stick into [a local store] and using their Fuji machines to edit the images.  The prints have come out great ...So far I have found myself taking many more pictures than I did with a film camera.  At the party and wedding I went to, all of my friends had a great time looking at the pictures on the LCD and have really enjoyed the images that I have emailed to them.  I know that a lot of people have digital cameras so I am surprised that more people don't bring their cameras with them because it really is fun to use.

A very big step up from those two.", "Date": "December 11, 2002"}, {"Title": "Downloading problems", "Author": "Deena Budd", "ReviewID": "R3PU3JUU7U9Y60", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera is okay, and the pictures are okay, but I've had to return two of them because the USB/downloading feature from the camera stopped working.

The Nikon 3100 is much better for me. The shutter speed is faster, the feel of the camera is like a traditional camera. You can just point and shoot if you want or it has \"scene modes\" which make it real easy to get the best shot possible in funky situations like for shooting in a museum, etc.I love mine.", "Date": "April 24, 2003"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this one!!", "Author": "STEVE OCHS", "ReviewID": "R2ZEY69YPUTJO9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Software wouldn't load on Window ME.

I made sure to set the camera to the highest resolution, highest quailty, and highest sharpness and there was still no improvement. I own an old Panasonic PV-SD4090 that is 1.2 MP (compared to the 3.2 MP of the Sony) that takes BETTER QUALITY pictures than this new Sony camera.In an attempt to try to figure out if I was doing something wrong, I looked all through the manual (including the troubleshooting section) and found nothing describing this problem. I also went onto the Sony website and found nothing describing this problem. I did a google search and found nothing. I tried phoning technical support, but nobody is available.In short, I'm returning this camera and purchasing something different. Maybe I just got a lemon, but I won't be taking any chances with another Sony camera.", "Date": "November 10, 2002"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "3.2-megapixel sensor captures enough detail to create prints up to 11 x 14\n3x optical plus 2x digital (6x total) zoom lens with autofocus\nIncludes 16 MB Memory Stick\nConnects with Macs and PCs via USB port\nUses rechargeable  InfoLithium battery (NP-FC10)", "Name": "Sony DSCP7 Cyber-shot 3.2MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TMT2PMHPL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000068UYR"}}
