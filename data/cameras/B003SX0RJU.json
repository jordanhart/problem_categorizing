It looked nice because it had it's own wireless uplink.  Anyways, I hooked the wireless thing up to the tv.  That was pretty easy, it connects just like a video game console.  The camera was pretty small.  A lot smaller than I thought it would be, which is nice for a security camera.  Anyways, I used a new battery I think for the 9v and it wouldn't keep the signal at all.  It might've been the battery though.  It worked well when it was plugged in, but who want's to plug in a wireless camera.  Anyways, I used it in a bright room and the image was very dark and the colors were washed out.  I tried using the manual focus and it made it a little better focused, but you still couldn't see anything well at all.  Not even VHS quality image.  The feed was pretty bad.  I suggest getting something that people have reviewed already.  But take my advice, keep searching for a security camera, you won't like this one.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice, but could be better", "Author": "G.
