{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Actually 3.5 stars, but...", "Author": "maxmasa31 \"maxmasa31\"", "ReviewID": "RTEOG59IWLUV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll bump it up to a four because it basically does everything I expected it to.I wanted the T2 for two reasons:  built-in 4GB memory and compact/stylish body.  And on both fronts, I am 100% happy.  The camera is even smaller than I thought, and has even garnered a few compliments, and even at the highest resolution, I can store a ton of pictures without the need to carry around memory sticks.I understand that ultra-compacts don't take the best photos and the flash is weak, so it doesn't bother me much.  Actually, I am pleasantly surprised with the photos this takes.  It's not as nice as my Pentax DSLR, but I don't expect it to be.  I wanted this for photos I would otherwise miss because I can't lug my DSLR kit everywhere.  The photos are well saturated, if a little soft because of the noise reduction/anti-shake, but when put on a 4x6, the photos look quite nice and crisp.  Outdoor shots look great, as do indoor shots in decent lighting--meaning most uses.  The flash works good up to about six feet, and as long as ISO is kept low, the photos are pretty good.The built-in 4GB memory was what sold me and it's fantastic, and mounts on your computer like a flash drive, no hassles.  It even has photo software built into the camera, though I can't attest to how well it work because it's PC only and I have a Mac.  There is a memory stick slot so you can transfer photos on the camera to a memory stick.  The bad news is, you can't set the camera to take photos directly to the memory stick by default.  It will only save to the memory stick once the internal memory fills up--which might be a while.  This doesn't bother me, though, as that's what I expected and even wanted.A small complaint is the menu system.  It can be hard to find some options, and it's not always obvious which on-screen icons are selectable or not.  Once you get used to it, it's not too confusing, but I still prefer good ol' buttons and a standard menu interface (like Canon's or my Pentax).A big gripe, however, is with the touchscreen and buttons.  The touchscreen looks a little soft (low resolution?) for its size, and it isn't as sensitive as I'd like, making menu navigation a bit of a pain.  Also, the touchscreen doesn't have a hard protective layer, so you're basically pressing on an LCD, discoloration and all--kind of scary!  Then, the playback and scrapbook buttons are too small and almost recessed.  I don't have large hands, but I have to use my thumbnail to look at my photos, and on a small camera like this with a big unprotected screen, that can be a bit nerve-wracking.Overall, this is a great pocket camera for quick snapshots, which is why I bumped it up to four stars.", "Date": "January 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Better than you think", "Author": "Louisa Ac Hurst", "ReviewID": "R383TRD0QAH10D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera before reading any reviews on it and after reading many reviews I found that a lot of people were posting negative feedback about it. However, so far I've been amazed at the quality of the pictures I've been taking. I think the reason people are taking bad pictures is because they're not using the right settings. Sure, changing settings can be annoying when you just want to take a picture, but the macro setting on the T2 is great and works absolutely brilliantly, has a special \"Slow Synchro\" flash which illuminates the background as well as the foreground (usually flash just illuminates the foreground), and the 4 GB internal memory is really helpful.Of course, it only has 3x zoom, but if you want a tiny camera you're not going to get much better than that. This camera is really cute, fits in your pocket (it's the size of a credit card), takes excellent pictures for a camera so small, has good battery life, a variety of pictures options and settings, face recognition, smile recognition. I really like it and just think that others are having trouble with it because they're not using the proper settings (which are really easy to use!)", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for This Amateur Photographer", "Author": "The Book Bird \"A not-so-secret book addict.\"", "ReviewID": "R3D86EVA4CLDID", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this came despite the negative reviews I read of it on this and other camera websites, and to be honest I have been pleasantly surprised. I am by no means a \"serious\" photographer- all I wanted was a camera that would take a photo when I pressed the button. The size of the camera is fantastic, and for me having the memory built internally is great  (maybe if I had a printer that you could insert a memory card into this would be an issue- however, I was told you could still insert a card into the camera if you wanted to).The photos I have taken so far have been great. To my untrained eye the quality seems just fine and I've been happy with everything I've uploaded to my computer so far. I don't really have a need for the smile recognition software or any of the other flashy add-ons, so they somewhat go to waste on me. The touch screen is great, though I have found that you do need to press on it firmly to get it to register sometimes (and slowly- it's not nearly as fast as my iPhone).My one negative comment would be that the screen interface is slightly confusing and despite reading through the manual I still am not quite sure how to fine tune some settings.

I used to own a Sony T1, the original sliding front pocket camera and was pretty disappointed with that one, so i'm not really Sony loyal, but this camera is a complete 180 from that one and I absolutely love it.

Can operate the camera by one hand only, including the zoom, to take pictures, for example if I catch an interesting light on a building while walking on the street.Low light scene programs work very well, took a few night skyline and fireworks shots recently.

I can say that the picture quality is more then decent if what youre looking for is to be able to take shots quickly.  If youre at a club, bar, beach, backyard BBQ, whatever, its great.  If youre a enthusiast that takes pics of birds in low light settings, you dont use digital cameras anyway.  Im a novice looking for decent/good/great pics in normal situations and I want to be able to load these pics on my laptop with ease.  I want a uncluttered display, easy to understand choices without having to read a novel for instructions on how to use this and that.  If this is you also then this camera will fit your needs too...it will just lighten your wallet a little.  Im sure there are other digital cameras that will do the same without the price though.  The 4GB internal is not as bad as some have said on here, its easy to transfer the pics you have taken to a SD card, you DO NOT have to use the USB cable for this if you have a card, I have a 4Gb card so its 8 GB altogether. YOU DO however have to transfer the pics to a card, you cant just take the pics and have them directed to the card.  What a pain right??  Its not that serious.

I have always had Sony cameras and I love them in general.  They take beautiful pictures, are easy to use and I've had very few problems with them.  This is my fourth.  I take A LOT of pictures.  My kids consider me their personal paparazzi, so I do give my cameras a workout.  I was swayed into getting this camera because I liked the way it looked, but there are a few things about it I find disappointing.  I have a Sony Vaio computer and in the past, I have always just popped my memory stick (with the adapter for the duo) into my computer to transfer the pictures.  That way I don't have to mess with cables since I am using a laptop.  This camera has 4 GB of internal memory, which is a great feature.  However, you can't choose to save to the memory stick pro duo instead.  The camera will only allow you to use that when the internal memory is full.  That is a huge disappointment for me.  Unless you fill the internal memory and keep it full all the time, you can't use the memory stick.  Also, the position of the lens is very close to the top of the camera.  This means when some people use it (doesn't usually happen to me), they put their finger right over it.  So I end up with lots of pictures with fingers over the people.  I think it is because the camera is so small, it is hard to get a good grip on it.  My last complaint is the button for viewing the pictures.  I think it is awkward and hard to press.

Don't get me wrong a lot of the other features like the touchscreen and aesthetic design with a lens cover that goes perfectly flat when closed are great. But I was very disappointed that the touchscreen is pretty buggy and doesn't respond well and the picture quality....well lets just say that it reminded me of the color reproduction of a camera bought in the 90's. I would have loved to do a video review instead but unfortunately I took it back to the sony store and bit the ~$50 restocking fee.This camera is for those not caring about great color reproduction and those who don't mind fidgeting with a hardly responsive touchscreen.

I own many and have at least 12 digital cameras in my immediate family and small business.  We use them frequently and this camera I bought for my 15 yr. old daughter to replace her brokenSony DSC-17.  That camera was very skinny and took amazing photos!  Very small and easy for a kid to carry around and not complain over the weight. These cameras are my window into her fun, exciting life and access to the contents of the camera, simply is critical for me.The DSC-T2's  internal memory and VERY camera specific cable to download to computers is a royal pain to use.  It loads photos and video to the internal memory first and therefore; using the average card reader is out and unless you carry this huge cable around with the camera, one cannot download photos from the internal memory without having one.Why not use standard cables and have an option to load to internal OR video cards on all cameras like this?I use card readers and or a generic usb/ camera cable (5 to 10 bucks, or less each) and download from ALL other SLR's and point and shoots using this cable. The Sony cable is never where we want it  (two house holds and much travel by daughter)  and if one could set a default to load photos to a memory card first instead of the internal memory, we could easily download photo by switching memory cards -like most other cameras- or just syncing the camera to computer with a simple, cheap usb generic (not 40 bucks each) cable.The picture quality -in auto modes-  is also at least 20 to 30% worse than the Canon SD900 or the Sony DSC-17 both of which we own..The touch screen menu is cool for kids but another pain for quick in the field camera adjustment.  My daughter is very computer literate (Touch iPod, homework, assignments on networks, Facebook, etc.) and she digs this camera..  I just can't download her photos to many laptops, desktops or printers without a better cable/ memory system built in to the camera.I will buy another Sony camera in the future/ Canon too!
