It's a light plastic thing with no flash. I definitely recommend it for children who are just starting to take pictures - who don't care about the quality.  I spent about an hour trying to make my pictures look good with the software they provide. It still didn't help. If you're looking to get a digital camera for pictures that you wish to look at often and show to other people, don't waste your money on this one.", "Date": "April 21, 2001"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for...", "Author": "\"connectikat\"", "ReviewID": "RPDVMFCRK7SR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "...and as far as this camera is concerned, that's not much! This is actually my second purchase of the Argus DC1500; the first one was defectve and had to be returned. This is a nice little camera for a child or someone just starting out, but you definitely won't get the features available on some of the pricier models. For one thing, this camera has no flash, so be prepared to do all of your photographing outdoors! Also, there were no instructions included in either of the two cameras I bought, so I'm basically winging it. There IS an \"addendum sheet\" explaining the included video and photo software, but what's it an addendum to? I find this camera very difficult to use. As long as it's plugged into the computer I can take pictures, but since there's no flash, they all come out fuzzy and I end up tinkering with the brightness levels just to get a decent result. On the other hand, it's SUPPOSED to run on three AAA batteries, but that option has rarely worked for me. Not sure if it's a problem with the camera or the batteries. In short, I regret purchasing this camera and will most likely be trading it in for a better known and more reliable model.
