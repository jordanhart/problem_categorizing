{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good, but not great", "Author": "Jim Larsen", "ReviewID": "RQZGWQ636BUQB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a good small point and shoot camera for the price. It is easy to use, has a very clear menu, and a very large LCD display. If you are looking for a 5X zoom with simple menus and an extra big display, this is a great deal. The downside with this camera is that the picture quality is not as good as more expensive cameras, and it does not do well in low light situations. The flash has an effective range of 9.8 feet. Beyond that range the picture will have poor focus or lots of digital noise. It says it can do 1600 and 3200 ISO, but the quality goes down in those situations. The manual says that even in 10 MB Fine mode (highest resolution) they don't recommend enlarging beyond 8 x 12 prints (which was the limitation of my last 3MP Olympus camera). It is nice and compact and easy to use. You will be happy with it as a snapshot camera, but you will want to spend more if you are a serious photographer. I have rated this a 5 because I think you get what you pay for. Even with its limitations, it is a great camera for the price.", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "easy to use have fun to shoot", "Author": "slim \"slim\"", "ReviewID": "RS19XDFTDTKG0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just back from cruise. used it to shoot everyday. I set the camera to the settings I wanted. It performed well for a small camera. small enough to put in pants or shirt pocket. Just love it and worth the price.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm FinePix J150 Digital camera", "Author": "Anon.", "ReviewID": "R1DGTILM93OL26", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first digital camera I have had, but I really like it. It's portable, easy to use and takes great pictures. I have been able to take pictures of flowers, insects, etc. for me to use in my classes (I teach Biology) and the clarity of the images is outstanding. I would highly recommend this camera!", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "ok", "Author": "sandy \"desert gal\"", "ReviewID": "RBHUFB0AG3G1X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the options, but unfortunately the screen shows streaks just horribly. I tried in various lighting and various subjects, but all the same. Then I hoped that perhaps it wouldn't print out that way, but no such luck. I am preparing to send back to Fuji for repair/replacement. But I really like the package I got (options, details)and felt it the best for the money. Just hope the return/repair process isn't too costly, or else I guess I should have paid up front for a more expensive model.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "camera guy", "ReviewID": "RMBMO3JLWY8SQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Of all the cameras I've owned in this price range, this has been my favorite.
