Safely packaged, timely delivered (thanks Cameta Camera), and already using it. Really great quality pictures. Looking forward to learn more about how to use the camera to get the best of it. I totally recommend it. The kit is ideal for beginners: you have all you need at once.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Robert McCotter", "ReviewID": "R3GK3S9XXCHG6S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is fantastic. I purchased it in order to switch effortlessly back and forth between photo shooting and video shooting. It certainly does the trick. The flip out LCD screen is an indispensable feature for filming. I am also pleased with the stock microphone and am very excited to test the microphone jack to capture even better audio.The only reason I have not given this package a 5 star rating is because the lens attachments are not what I would recommend. If you are going to buy this quality of camera either stick with the 18-55 lens, or put in a bit of extra cash for an extra lens. The lens attachments are time consuming to put on and render the zoom unusable at certain zoom distances.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good deal", "Author": "yangs", "ReviewID": "R2OGRQ2OEVWOIV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for a long road trip. Worth the price. Though the zoom lens and wide-angle lens are not professional, they are still useful for beginners. Good deal in a word.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera is great, but it came packaged awkwardly.", "Author": "Eric W. Bowers", "ReviewID": "R3TTDR9FVEM76L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The camera works great. The product came with an extra pack of a telephoto and wide angle lens kit. The package was ripped open when I received it and those lens will not attach to the camera. Everything else I am happy about. I am just slightly disappointed that I chose to get a package and one of the parts of it does not work. Love the Nikon D5100. Camera works great. All the other accessories are very nice--especially the camera bag.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Powerful Camera", "Author": "Luz Davila", "ReviewID": "R240RBTD095SK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so happy with this camera, I got nice and clear pictures and I love it.
