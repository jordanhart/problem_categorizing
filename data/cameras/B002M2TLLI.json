{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Robust, well-designed, easy to use, with a few idiosyncrasies", "Author": "vocal admirer", "ReviewID": "R3MNFG3V70RPAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The PlantCam is a robust, well-designed device that produces timelapse videos at a very affordable price. It also has some idiosyncrasies that are worth knowing about. For me, it replaces an awkward method of timelapse photography in which I attached a video camera via Firewire to a Mac laptop and used iMovie's option of capturing frames at a reduced rate. That method was very flexible (the framerate was infinitely adjustable and the camera could zoom in as needed), but it tied up a computer and video camera for the duration of the movie, and it could not easily be used outdoors. By contrast, the battery-operated PlantCam is self-contained, compact, sturdy, sealed against the weather for use outdoors, and designed to do this one task well. Its preset choice of framerates and non-zoom lens are less flexible than the iMovie approach, but the PlantCam does the job at about a twentieth of the cost of the other equipment.The designers made choices that generally are very shrewd and user friendly. In Setup mode, one selects an interval from \"ASAP\" (almost real time) through 0.5, 1 or 5 min (the settings I have used for full-day movies) to one frame per day. Images are stored on an SD card that is easily tranferred to a computer, and there is also a cable for playing images directly to a TV. Images can be labeled with the interval, date, and clock time, or labeling can be turned off. Image size is selectable in three steps from 640x480 to 2560x1920, and the image quality is good (rich colors and deep blacks). Focus is selected from one of three choices spanning 11\" to infinity. Both a laser pointer and a viewfinder are available to establish where the camera is pointed. For multi-day recordings, the time the camera turns on and off can be preset in hourly increments. All in all, the designers have provided well-thought-out functionality.But the PlantCam also has a few idiosyncrasies that were not what I expected, although I was able to find workarounds for all of them. In particular, it helps to understand that at heart the PlantCam is a device for capturing still frames. The \"video\" setting does not produce a single timelapse video as I expected, but instead captures a series of 10-second video clips at the specified interval. (I am mystified by the utility of this series of video clips.) To produce a \"normal\" timelapse video, one instead captures still photos and uses Setup mode's \"convert to video\" function to compile the still frames into an AVI video. The conversion is limited to 360 frames, which is not enough for long videos at higher framerates. The workaround is to convert the still images in blocks of 360, specifying the first frame and last frame for each conversion, and then paste the blocks together in QuickTime before saving the compiled video as a QuickTime (.MOV) file. Another idiosyncrasy: saving the AVI file is wise even if it is complete because of a software bug that gives each compiled AVI file the same date and time. The individual jpegs are correctly time and date stamped from the camera's internal clock, but the AVI file is always stamped Nov 25, 1961. (I have corresponded with Wingscapes about this bug and perhaps it will be fixed in a future firmware update.) Finally, another limitation of the software is that AVI videos are always 640x480 even if the stills have higher resolution. Thus, there is no point in capturing stills at higher resolution if conversion to an AVI movie is the goal. However, QuickTime does provide a workaround: by importing a series of high-resolution stills, QuickTime can produce a high-resolution movie.In spite of these few puzzling design decisions, the PlantCam is an excellent choice. It definitely does the job it was intended to do easily, with high-quality results, and at a very favorable cost. It's fun to use, and I'd recommend it highly.", "Date": "March 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Cool Camera or You Will Never Have This Much Fun For So Little Money!", "Author": "D.

Its name (PlantCam) could give the impression that its only use is for seeing a bud, flower, plant or garden grow \"high speed,\" compressing hours, days, or weeks into a few minutes. But it can be used with delight in many other nature-situations with satisfaction, showing \"sped-up replay\" in the motions of clouds, shadows, animal intra-flock associations, indoor flower turning, snow melting, and even things like recording the development of a drawing, construction, what people mostly look at in a store window, and on and on.  The camera works fine with variable time selections, a laser pointer for down to 11 inch close-up work, a view finder for distant projects, several levels of resolution, date-time imprint and more.  I have viewed the picture results with Windows Picture Manager, finding the filmstrip view nice for speeding through the sequence.  In Windows Movie Maker I can move what might be hundreds of pictures to its story board and play the changes as a sort of movie.  I also have the company's BirdCam and get incredible bird closeups. The cameras are simple to operate with almost intuitive control layout, but I recommend you work through the carefully written and adequate manual with camera in hand several times.  For a number of times I was overlooking the last step, that is, turn the dial to \"auto\" before setting the camera on the tripod or ground for its shooting. I am convinced this camera would be great for an adult to use in collaboration with a youngster in discovery activity.

trail cameras which is the purpose i got this camera, Since I got it I have been testing it around the house and have got some interesting results. This camera does exactly what it says pretty well. the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5-stars is due to image quality. while not awful, there is plenty of room for improvement. Overall, I would highly recommend this for its intended purpose, and I am anxious to try it out as a scouting camera later in the summer. I think it could fill a niche that motion activated trail camera don't do well in.looking at a broader area at designated times seeing deer outside the detection range of trail camera.Update: 8-1-11: I had the camera monitor the progress of construction of the garage I was building. The camera worked flawlessly on a single set of batteries for over 6-weeks.Update 9-14-11:This camera has been in the field for 3 weeks watching some promising areas for deer, however, I have had a lot of frustration with the camera not working, I was expecting thousands of pictures over a 4-day span, but would check the camera and it would have 120 images. I checked the batteries they were between 40% and 50% I would reset everything and try again, same results. I finally took the batteries and charged them and tried again, That worked.I had the camera set to take pictures every minute from 7:00 AM to 8:00 PMMoral of the story keep the batteries fresh or fully charged.still a great toolUpdate 1-5-2012:The internal feature is very limited in the number of photos that can be converted to video. I used Windows Movie for some conversions, but it was very slow. I Tried Picassa3 a free download from google it it works like a charm, I will be using it from now on.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Really worth the money, better than you'd think", "Author": "Richard Aplin", "ReviewID": "R3GMEIDHV8W140", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very impressed with this - might seem that $80-odd is a bit expensive for a glorified webcam, but it's really a well thought out product.It's properly weatherproofed, really easy to use, and comes with various bungees and stand attachments so you can properly mount it for long periods of time (don't want it moving!)Lots of attention to detail; the menus are simple, the picture quality is fine, you have a decent range of time intervals, SD cards work without hassle.You don't want something unreliable or high-maintenance, and you do want something solidly mounted and weatherproof.

I was looking for an easy and inexpensive way to take photos every day during construction.  I tested the unit with general photos before putting it in place because I wanted to see what kind of picture quality I would get and also learn how to use the camera.It is pretty straight forward and simple.  What I didn't expect but I should have based on a couple of wildlife cameras I have, battery life is less than stellar.It came with a set of 4 Kodak Akaline AA batteries included. I didn't expect them to last very long just because you don't know how long they sat on the shelf at the warehouse. They lasted about 4 days with the camera taking 1 photo per hour for 14 hours a day.  I next tried the Duracell Alkalines, and got about 8 days out of the camera. Same settings, 1 pic per hour, 14 hours a day.I also ordered the power supply that is made for this camera and now use this even though it limits where you can put the camera. It comes with about an 8 ft cord.  ( Also note the power supply is not weatherproof)Overall, this is pretty good camera especially for the money.  I think there is a higher resolution version available now.  This one is 4 mp, and I have it set on medium quality, about 2 mp per picture.  Picture quality is surprisingly good for something appears to have a plastic lens. (  I don't know that, but assume that it is based on the rest of the camera construction)If you view the pictures on your pc, you will see the date, time and name of the camera at the bottom of the picture.  You can turn off the imprint if you don't want the date and time noted on the photo.  Also, you can change the name of the camera.  The default name is \" Plantcam\".  I think you get 12 characters for the name.It will accept the high capacity SD cards.  I looked in several places to try and find that information.  I am not sure it even says that in the instruction manual, but I put an 8 GB SDHC card in the unit and it works fine, and gives me a capacity for about 7900 pictures. I don't have any 16 GB or 32 GB cards so I don't know if they work in this camera.  You will get an offer for a free 2 GB card by mail from the manufacturer if you register the camera.  ( It does not come with a card) The 2GB card gives you a photo capacity of about 2399 pics at medium resolution.Have not tried the video function so I can't comment on that.Be careful if you use the wake to light or shut off at Dusk feature.  When I tried using those two settings, the camera did not always wake up, and didn't always shut down.  You wind up with a lot of blank ( dark) photos using the shut down at dusk feature.  You wind up missing a lot of early morning shots with the wake at light feature.  (Other users have mentioned this same problem so I would be careful using those options.)I finally just put the schedule times in, 7am to 9pm and I only wind up a few dark shots at night .  Will probably change the schedule again to 7 am to 7pm once we go back to normal time and switch from Daylight Saving Time.This camera comes with a pretty nice little universal mounting bracket that allows you to attach it to a pole ( up to about 2  or 3 inches in diameter in your garden or a piece of rebar at a construction site.  You can also mount the camera on a conventional tripod.  It also has mounting straps 2 types belt type and bungy cord type straps for mounting on trees, or other large objects.It does have a laser aim feature  and a view finder as do most of the wildlife cameras of this type.It also comes with a small measuring tape for setting your range.  You have 3 range options on the lens so you do need to estimate the range from your subject on anything closer than 3 feet.  The lens settings are 11 inches to 17 inches, 17 inches to 3 feet, and 3 ft and over .It  also comes with USB cable and a video out cable to connect the camera to your TV.( I have not tried either one)I usually take the card out of the camera and copy the pictures to my PC for viewing.My only negative for this camera is sometimes it is hard to tell if it is on or off. Pressing he power button activates the LCD display, but the only way you really know if it is taking photos is the red led that blinks every 3 to 5 secs.I was trying to turn the camera off to make some adjustments and could not tell if it was off.  I think the default is on unless you put it in the setup mode. I have several pics of myself that the camera took while I was making adjustments.In conclusion, this is a pretty good, simple time lapse camera. I already ordered a second one and a power supply to go with it.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "WOW!

I have always been fascinated with time lapse ever since my son and I made a video showing my grandson's toys putting themselves away. That was way long time ago and the video camera allowed single frame remote trigger.  Modern digital cameras are incredible but unless you are prepared to pay about 10 times what PlantCam costs, time lapse is out of reach and remote trigger near impossible. With the computing power available in today's digicams, where the heck is it fellas? My Android fone can do it!Enter PlantCam. The resolution is satisfactory and high def 1080p can be attained with third party editing software. The focal lengths are more than adequate from macro to infinity. The timing features (daily start, daily stop, interval) makes for EZ shooting. What came in the box was a big surprise. The well built weather proof camera with laser pointer built in for the perfect shot, a very sturdy and adjustable mounting device, a carry strap, a miniUSB cable, A video cable, a tape measure (to help you get the correct focal length), bungee cords to attach the camera to a tree or post and BATTERIES (yes, they say not but they are).What's more, fifteen minutes after I had the box open I began my first time lapse and about half of those minutes were spent finding a tripod that would fit on my window shelf! That's how intuitive the camera's controls are. Couple hours later, I had a sunset.Best method is to forget the camera's AVI mode. What you want to do is capture a series of sequentially enumerated JPG images (a 2 gig SD will hold about 7500 and the camera handles the sequence) then compile those with third party software. I have PowerDirector but there is a free Open Source program out there that will do it for you.  Google \"Avidemux\" to get it. All you do is point to the first numbered file in the folder with your JPGs and Avidemux will draw all of them in and make your movie. NO 360 frame limits and it's free. Choose MPEG-4 ASP (avcodec) for the encoding and choose AVI for the output. Set your frame rate for the most pleasing results then save your AVI movie.Only con I could find for this camera is that it needs lots of light to get good quality.

Along with being a \"plant cam\" for taking time lapse pics of developing plants and such, it can also be used to perform time/use studies.  For example, I set it up to photograph my humming bird feeder at a 5 minute interval.  The camera operated for a total of 1400 minutes.  I also knew, by timing 20 hummingbird visits to the feeder, that the average time for a hummingbird at the feeder was 8 seconds.  Thus the probability of the bird being at the feeder when a picture is taken is simply 8/300=0.0267.  Of the 281 photos taken, 20 of them captured a hummingbird.  Thus, I could estimate the number of visits to the feeder during the 1400 minutes to be 20/0.0267=749.  That's roughly 32 visits per hour.  During this 1400 minute interval, 121 ml of sugar solution was consumed.  I can then further estimate that the average feed consumed per visit to be 121/749=0.16 ml.  By knowing the caloric content of each ml of feed solution, total daily consumption of feed, and daily caloric needs of the hummingbird (about 10 calories/day) one could even go further to estimate the local population if one could account for all food sources.

The best quality is obtained by setting the camera for the highest resolution individual photos and stitching them together yourself.  If you use a Mac, you'll need to search for and download a free \"Time-lapse Compiler\" software package and figure out how to use it (not hard but no instructions either).  You can import the photos from  an SD card right into iPhoto but you'll have to then export them as sequential JPEGs to another file folder for the compiler to process them.  That sequence actually works well because having them in iPhoto first makes mass editing easier, and there will be plenty of mass editing.  The video files from the compiler can then be copied back to iPhoto where they're more easily accessed and processed in iMovie if you're going to be connecting a series of videos or want to add other features.The biggest drawbacks to the camera as sold are the lack of included time-lapse compiling software for the individual photos, the lack of any editing advice in the instructions, or anyone at the company who knows anything about it.  When I called, the woman who answered the phone was pleasant enough but when I asked about these things she said \"I don't have a Mac, have never used one, and don't know what to tell you\".

I have already used it to video a snow storm and icicles forming. It could use a bit of a redesign, however, in regards to where the plug-in port is located for the adapter. It is difficult to use the camera with an adapter, when mounted to a tripod, because of the port's location. Also, they might sell more if they advised people in their advertising that it is compatible with an adapter.Also, I had direct contact with the company regarding the adapter issue and they were extremely polite and very helpful.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Easy to use", "Author": "Scott A Sandler", "ReviewID": "R2AV1YJJO0XOVL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This thing does what it's supposed to do.

It works great! I set it up 10-15 feet up a tree watching wide open areas. You can easily spot deer & turkey out to 150 yards, further if you had low grass or snow. This is a very well made device with a solid feel & intuitive operation. I can watch a couple of 2 minute videos & have the same information that I could have gotten only by sitting a tree stand sunup till sundown for a week! I will leave one of these running in my tree stands during the season to see what goes on when I am not there. I advise that you buy a pair of 2GB SD cards & use rechargeable AA batteries. Each time I check the camera I swap out batteries & SD card to take home & view on the computer leaving the plantcam in the field.CONS1-The camera has software to convert the photos into a video, but will only do 360 photos at a time. If you have 800 photos you will have to tell it to make videos using photos 1-360, 361-721 & again from 722-800. The conversion process is annoyingly slow, like bring a sandwich slow. Probably around 12 minutes per 360. I start it converting & then do other tasks or hike to the next spot I will set it up in while it works. Instead of the on-board software I have used MS Moviemaker but I find the on-board software videos run quicker & let me see more than Moviemaker does . The video conversion process preserves the individual images also so I can select images of game to save in a folder with the video for easy review.2-While it comes with a great mounting bracket & other mounting options there is no way to secure it against theft, which make sense since it was intended to watch garden flowers & not food plots. With some inventiveness you can figure out ways to keep it safe.Overall the pros outweigh the cons such that I am ordering another one of these cameras.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worked good!", "Author": "J \"Law107\"", "ReviewID": "R1ASU895PDB5OM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like the plant cam, easy to use and was fun to watch my garden grow.

I'll update later.Why only four stars?  Picture quality was good, but the color was a bit too saturated.  That's my only complaint.The good stuff:  This camera is highly customizable, easy to use, and produces darn good photos all things considered.  It's got tripod mounts on two sides, so you can set it up vertically or horizontally.  It comes with a mounting bracket, which I've attached to a plastic lawn chair, or it can be used as a wall mount.  Or you can use the included bungees or strap to attach it to a tree or post.It has a laser pointer so you can see about how well you've aimed at your subject, even if you can't look through the viewfinder.Photo settings are low (640x480), medium (2048x1536), and high (2560x1920), and video will be low quality.  If you're shooting photos, you can tell it to shoot 1, 2, or 3 at a time, which I guess might be useful if you think your subject might be moving (on a windy day, perhaps.)You can tell the camera what time to wake up, or you can allow it to measure available light.  It won't turn off automatically at night, though.  (From the manual: \"There is no 'BY LIGHT' option to prevent inclement weather from temporarily turning off the camera in the middle of the day.\")It's got USB out, TV out, and of course you can always take the SD card out and get at the images that way.  It supports SDHC, and just about any SDHC card will work.  A slower (and cheaper) card will be fine for this camera.  It doesn't come with a card, so get one if you don't have one.  Otherwise you'll be using the 16MB of internal memory, and you'll only be able to store 100 low quality images (or 10 high quality images) that way.It's a little tricky to configure if you can't see the front of the camera.  (Mine is pointed down at a pineapple plant.)  But the controls are easy to distinguish by touch, so once you learn the location of the controls it should become easier.  (I hope.)My first photos were pretty good, and I'm looking forward to putting together some videos.

It works fine and takes surprisingly nice pictures for such a simple camera.  I bought it to use the interval shutter feature (taking pictures every 30 seconds, minute, hour, etc).  I wanted to be able to wear it for a day and have it take pictures all day long so that I could put them into a movie about my day.  It works for this purpose, but this camera is fairly large and heavy.  Think like the size of a tissue box and the weight of a pair of sneakers.  Also, people kept asking me what it was- some people thought it was a heart monitor.  If I wanted to use it as a plant camera, I think this would be an awesome choice.
