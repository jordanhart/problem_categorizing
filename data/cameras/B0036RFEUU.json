{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Defective camera?", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R2PWZF8YU3U7HP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received the \"Samsung SL50 10.2 MP Digital Camera with 5X Optical Zoom and 2.5-Inch LCD Display (Silver)\" on time, however, when set to Digital Image Stabilization(DIS) mode, the pictures came out blurrier than if it was set on normal Smart mode. I shot pictures in DIS mode both in hand, and on a flat surface with a timer to insure no movement of camera. It is possible that the pictures it took could have been the extent of the capabilities of the camera, but after contacting Amazon and also the seller, neither were able to determine if this was a faulty camera.I know very little about cameras, and thus I may be comparing cameras in different classes, but the Olympus Stylus 500 I bought in 2005 still produces sharper image in similar conditions than this particular SL50, regardless of if the SL50 was in Smart or DIS mode.Returned camera.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good and cheap digital camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Arvrim\"", "ReviewID": "R3H6N98AE492S6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third samsung camera, i bought one for my mother and another sL50 to my ssister in law. These caeras are cheap and excellents gifts. Godd performance for a entry camera.

Lau", "ReviewID": "R10S0G8VITT1PF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the Samsung SL50 for features such as 27mm wide angle, movie zoom while shooting, 5x zoom etc. The camera is mainly plastic, and when you open the battery door, you immediately fear of breaking it. When I try to put the battery in, it went in the wrong way without forcing it. It took me quick a while to pull it back out and reinsert it correctly, there should be foolproof way to allow it insert just one way. The catch for releasing the battery is destine to break easily. The biggest disappointment is the lens, it is not sharp at all, even viewing with a 15\" computer monitor without enlarging the image. When taking movie outside, stray light comes in the lens causing a pink streak, it is quick disturbing. I can live with the other short comings except the quality of the picture, simply not sharp!", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice basic camera", "Author": "J. Such", "ReviewID": "R1F5JTA1GJNJZ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought one of these for my wife when she lost her old one - she just wanted something basic to keep in her purse in case she saw something and wanted to take a picture of it.  It does a pretty decent job of capturing a good photo, though the simplistic settings limit your ability to do more creative shots - if you want to do that, do yourself a favor and get a DSLR or something.  For point and shoot, this little camera does a good job.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelente", "Author": "WILFREDO E GOMEZ G", "ReviewID": "R2R8ZA2K7M09T0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Es una c\u00e1mara buena, tiene buena nitidez las imagenes, f\u00e1cil de manipular y por el costo me parece de muy buena calidad, se las recomiendo", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "good for occasional use", "Author": "Alla S.", "ReviewID": "R1XHWRT4YKM0XR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is very easy to use and has good picture. It's great for non-professional, everyday use. The cons for this camera were no image stabilization, and a only a so-so zoom function. Otherwise, this is an attractive camera and is comfortable to carry around.

Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R3OZ98MMUL8SZF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this camera at the beginning of the year and decided to test all of its features before writing this review.  This is the short summary of what I found.PROSThe size of the camera is quite nice.  It is very small and fits very easily in my front pocket, which is nice since the baby can sport 10.2 MP pictures.  Flash, Macro and Timer options are very easy to control as it is just a click away from taking the desired picture.  The cable/charger that comes with the camera is very compact as well, which enhaces its compact properties.  Video recording is not HD, but is clear and crisp and the microphone is sensible enough to pick up people's voice at 10-15 feet of distance.  The battery life is good as well, and the charging doesn't take more than a two hours (from my experience).CONSThe camera has two main problems;  top performance (pictures) and software (laking of select button for modes).  The sensor in the camera appear to not be as sharp as desired.  Many picture that were taken in both, high and low light conditions, experience a blurriness on them. The desired picture had to be taken multiple times because of this blurriness issue.  It specially happened when the flash was activated, perhaps the excess light coming from the flash affects the performance of the sensor in this camera.  In terms of software, to switch from picture taking modes or even form picture taking to video recording it was a pain.  There is no physical selection button, so everytime you what to chagne something you have to enter and dig in the menu of this camera.  which is fine at the beginning, but it get tiresome after a few hours of use.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "good little camera", "Author": "R.
