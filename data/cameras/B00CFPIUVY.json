{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Just amazing!", "Author": "Mark Williams", "ReviewID": "R1MF1YB6UB9GYH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm no professional, but this camera has almost everything a photo enthusiast needs to keep the shutter snapping! Small, sleek, and has the look of a higher end camera but without the price tag. It also has plenty of features to give the impression you shelled out the big bucks.The wi-fi connectivity makes sharing photos easier than ever, whether it be with your phone or tablet, e-mail, to your PC. Picture quality is superb for the type of camera, clear and full of color and detail. The pop-up flash is a great addition, keeping it safely out of the way when not in use. The hybrid touch screen makes controlling the settings as smooth as working a cell phone and the variety of shooting styles will keep anyone busy trying new techniques. One of my favorite features is the ability to connect the camera to my phone and use the phone as a controller, eliminating the need to set up the camera and run into the shot with a self timer. It is well worth the price, and if you get this bundle package, all the extras are very good quality.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Susan Wilson", "ReviewID": "R10JZNY114PKOZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my daughter and the photos she takes look like a professional photographer took the photos.", "Date": "September 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic pics!", "Author": "Elizabeth A.

Out of the box, the wireless functions don't work unless you install apps on your smartphone and your PC.  The apps were declared spyware by my antivirus and disabled.  I'm a computer tek by trade and have been setting up network printers for over 10 years.  You cannot set a manual ip address or transfer pictures to your computer wirelessly with the wifi.  The wifi function is useless on this camera because they didn't design the camera with an embedded web server interface or an ftp or telnet port.  I talked to their tek support and they said that there is no upgrade for the software and it is not open source so I cannot fix it myself. Touchscreen works fine, but I think the lcd draws too much off the battery.The battery capacity is too small for this camera.  It takes a long time to charge and goes dead in about 1/2 hour when in use.  I called samsungs tek support on this issue and they told me I broke the camera by leaving in on the charger all night... yeah right.  They sent me a replacement battery and the problem is still the same.  I went to a concert with a full charge on the battery and the battery went dead during the opening act from taking only 10 pictures with flash.  When the battery goes dead, the camera forgets the date and you have to reset it every time you use the camera (annoying).I've always loved samsung products and bought this one without reading any reviews,.. but for this product, their hardware and software development teams blew it on this one.  Wait for a real wifi camera or (p.s. mines forsale cause they wouldn't take it back at the walmart)", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera", "Author": "sherri garrett", "ReviewID": "R1OMYV19805R7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the camera.
