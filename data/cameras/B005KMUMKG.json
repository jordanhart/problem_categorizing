After reading Amazon customer reviews I decided to pay 3 times more for an ELK, instead of Elk look alikes. I was dissapointed to find the new ELK arrived discharged. I checked voltage at 10 volts instead of 12+ volts. I assumed JMAC would charge the battery before shipping. The low voltage means JMAC didn't charge it and/or it is years old and won't hold a 12 volt charge. Anyway I charged it and it held the 12 volt charge for two days. So I installed it and \"hope\" I get 5+ years service, as with my original ELK. If I don't get expected service Amazon and JMAC will hear about it.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "A trophy Elk", "Author": "Bob McCoy", "ReviewID": "R3Y3JQVJFFXBZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My home security system, installed in 2002, had an Elk 1280 backup battery. A few month back, during an extended power outage, I realized that the old battery's capacity was severely diminished, and decided to replace the battery. A lead-acid battery that lasts more than about five (5) years is a well-built battery, so I decided to get another Elk brand battery.Many of the vendors of \"Elk 1280\" batteries are actually selling a replacement from a different manufacturer (for instance Elk ELK-1280 12V 8Ah Sealed Lead Acid Battery), so I was pleased to find that JMAC Supply on Amazon carried the Elk brand (ELK 1280 Battery Lead Acid 12V-8.0Ah). I'm sure we have all saved a few bucks at some time or another buying batteries that failed to deliver the same lifetime as the OEM battery. I have no expectation that the new battery will go as long as the original, but I am confident that it will provide yeoman service, and provide value in excess of a cheaper substitute.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "good savings", "Author": "shopper", "ReviewID": "R1E2JXH3LATMYR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "good savings & works excellent with a home alarm system .EXCELLENT PRODUCT/ Worth the savings in cash vaule, buy the product", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Battery Power.", "Author": "Ernest Hammer", "ReviewID": "R1BQF7CU3QYZTM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great replacement  to use in my battery back up.
