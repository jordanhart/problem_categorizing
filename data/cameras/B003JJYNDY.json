{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent IP Security Camera", "Author": "K. Barr", "ReviewID": "R21BWMB2ZKU1RS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent weatherproof IP security camera for a home or small office. It can be powered completely by Power over Ethernet and provides a very clear color image up to 1600x1200 pixels and includes infrared emitters for nighttime shots [with limited range]. The sturdy mounting bracket is included. Besides securely mounting the camera to a vertical surface, the bracket acts as a cable run, concealing all cabling to the camera and providing for a very clean installation. The camera includes an on-board SD memory slot that can be used for local storing of logs, pictures, and video clips. The web interface is functional, although a bit encumbered by too many page reloads when navigating menus and setup. The built-in firmware provides a fairly complete and robust feature set. Four separate video streams are available [different resolutions, cropping, formats, quality etc] in MPEG4 and MJPEG formats, over HTTP or RTSP protocols. This is a fixed, stationary camera and does not have any mechanical pan-tilt-zoom features, however the high resolution and fairly wide-angle lens provides for effective electronic pan-tilt-zoom with the advantage that moving and zooming one video stream does not affect the others. The included software, which can optionally be run on a separate PC, is powerful but fairly standard software for a manned monitoring station [no intelligent video analytics features, difficult searching of archived video] but the camera's range of features and use of very open, non-proprietary formats provides compatibility with nearly any 3rd-party monitoring software.Pros:* High resolution, excellent picture* Included bracket and clean install* Full-featured firmware* Power-over-Ethernet* IR emitters for night shots* Weatherproof* Non-proprietary protocolsCons:* Low-powered IR emitters produce limited range and illuminated cone in center of frame.* No mechanical PTZ* Not exactly little", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent external IP high resolution cameras", "Author": "Fernando Saffi \"fsaffi\"", "ReviewID": "R3S4IA02M7TY3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have 5 of these babies for over 2 years now working 24x7.

I live in the country.  I have one in the front and one in the back of the house.  The picture is fabulous and for daytime viewing it is top notch.  At night, you really want external illumination.  It only shoots out about 30-40 feet where you can see definition.  My extra high powered illumination coming from another camera allows me to see through this one at distances close to 90 feet rather well.  I am now getting an external illumination light for the back.The camera in the front did go out after 6 weeks.  For some reason it was very pixilated or totally blank on my screen.  I sent it back and it was quickly returned in working order.  The rear camera has not skipped a beat.I would def buy another Vivotek camera at this point.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Superior night vision, above-freezing temps only", "Author": "K. Martin", "ReviewID": "R3NI4LFN1J61H8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "These Vivotek cameras are expensive, but now I finally have a home security camera that lets me see at night. I had to manually set the focus and zoom, but just one time, and I did so by shining a laser pointer at the wall down the hallway, had the camera hooked up to a laptop on the other end of the hallway, and zoomed/focused on the laser. I've paired this camera with a TRENDnet TEW-733GR N300 Wireless Gigabit Router, and so far no dropped frames and no freeze-ups. I had previously linked this camera to a TP-Link Gigabit router and had freeze-ups and intermittent dropped frames.I had chosen a super-cheap network cable plug to connect to this camera, and it didn't seem to fit all that great, so I switched to a Paladin plug, and all is now well.UPDATE 1/12/2014I have since dropped one star from my review. I live in Wisconsin, and as soon as the temps dropped below freezing, the camera stopped working. We're having a January thaw, and magically, the camera works again. I've also brought the camera indoors to test, and it works just fine. Tested and rested my outdoor connection--it's okay. At night, I can see the faint red color of the LEDs, so I know it sees the power. It just refuses to operate below freezing. It may be weatherproof, but it is not cold proof.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointing", "Author": "Luke Chavers \"- Luke\"", "ReviewID": "RAX3KLZJFJZE1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Anyone setting up a home surveillance system is pretty much forced to become a home security expert because there is very little that is \"easy\" about any of these cameras.  So, Vivotek did not start that trend, but they did follow it to the letter.I bought this camera because I wanted to be able to see license plates as they leave my property.  My other cameras cost between $100 and $200, but I wanted to be sure this particular use case had the best that I could afford.Honestly, I see very little different between this guy and the cheap ones.. very little difference at all.Vivotek has done NOTHING to make the installation or maintenance easier in any way.  The mount is only good for completely flat surfaces (I have siding) and the waterproof wiring harness requires you to remove and reattach the POE cat5 cable.  For most folks, that's not a problem, but with me being color blind, its not an option.. so my wall is no doubt leaking water in right now.The web interface is horrible, just like all other camera web interfaces, and every aspect of installing this camera is tedious and annoying.  I'll post a screenshot of that after I write this review.I bought a 32gb memory card and put it in there.  The camera seems to like the idea, but I have not managed to figure out how to record to it (or anywhere else, for that matter).I also don't know what I should have expected from the Infrared, but I know what I got... basically nothing.  I'll be sure the screenshot I post includes that as well.Ok, on the positive side.  The camera does look nice, and everything is made of metal so it screams quality.  The \"1080p\" (I guess) looks ok, during the day, so no complaints there... but I cannot read car tags.  It also seems to be generally compatible with most software I've tried, except in cases where the software is obviously the crummy component.In the end, there's no way I would buy another one of these unless they dropped the price to around $100.  At the same time, I don't really have any remarkably insightful alternatives to recommend since I've been mostly disappointed in each camera I've purchased (except my Foscam PTZ).All I will say is... if you're buying this camera expecting to \"pay a bit more for something better\", you'll probably be upset in the end.  My four QCN7001B cameras are just as good (not counting the QC NVR, which is absolute garbage).My advice.. move on..", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid device", "Author": "Garry R.", "ReviewID": "R1AK166X4QWABT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Construction solid.  Sealing is solid.  Firmware is good, performance is good.  Does exactly what the advertised specs say it will.IR illumination is not very wide, but this is clearly stated, so not a con.  I added the optional IR illuminator, and the camera controls that properly.  But I had to setup this external IR control separately via computer before having the DVR connect to the camera, or the functionality was getting locked out.  But once setup, the DVR connection does not alter that.Nice, clear images.
