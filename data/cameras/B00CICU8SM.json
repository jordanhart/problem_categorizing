{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This is a good didgital camera, (But)!!", "Author": "HHA", "ReviewID": "RHRO324TEZNX0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I thought I would be able to get some great zoom-in shots combined with my zoom lens and the digital zoom built into the camera, turns out yes there is a digital zoom but the camera will not take a picture in the zoom mode. The digital magnification is only there to assist in locking on to a subject in the distance. I nearly sent this camera back because of this. The thing is I had a lot of paraphernalia for this camera to include two lenses from when I had purchased a canon rebel camera years ago that was not digital.So I decided to keep it due to already having over $700 in  accessories previous investment. It also came with some very complicated firmware that is by all accounts not an easy program to use, there is a reason they call it \"Canon Professional\" not much use for a novice camera buff like me.Overall it is a very good camera for a professional photographer.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$849.99", "Features": "This Kit includes 12 items all with USA Warranty and manufacturer's supplied accessories\nCanon EOS Rebel T5i 18.0 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 3-inch Touchscreen and Full HD Movie Mode (Body Only)\n32 Gigabyte SDHC Secure Digital Memory Card - Secure Digital USB Card Reader - Universal Memory Card Wallet - Pack of LCD Screen Protectors\nAdditional LP-E8 Rechargeable Lithium-ion Replacement Battery Pack - Well Protective SLR Camera Gadget Bag w/Pockets & Strap\nFull Size 59\" Tripod W/Case - Focus DVD Guide to Digital SLR Cameras - Focus Digital Grey Card Set - Focus 5pc Deluxe Lens Care & Cleaning Kit - HDMI cable for HDTV connection - BONUS!!
