Unfortunately, this system does not work.  Only one of the cameras worked when the DVR was connected to my TV and I could not install the software on my compatible computer.  Unfortunately, the seller refused to acknowledge that the product was defective.  Only after I filed an Amazon claim did they agree to accept a return less 20% -- unless they determined the product was defective upon receipt.  I've shopped on Amazon for years and am usually quite satisfied.  I'm surprised they're doing business with this company.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for", "Author": "E.

The reception to my receiver is spottie at best with cameras in 40 foot range of the receiver. The color yeild only B&W; thus far. Reception fade away at night.The connections on the cameras to power supply should be much longer to keep out of weather for outdoor use.Receiver has four antenna that have limited movement that may contribute to issues--can only go left or right.Camera do not seem to be geared to any one channelI purcased a new receiver from another vendor that has eight channels that rove or stay static color is great, reception is more constant.I can not use the usb and record to PC as desired.Will try to find a work around to solve this issue.Do not wait as I did to have outlets & cameras installed by an electrician before testing out cameras--- my mistake and loss.I'm sure this my be a good system in doors with limited distance and interferance.", "Date": "February 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Heard it didn't work well, but mine didn't work at all", "Author": "JackSheet", "ReviewID": "RBKH68HXV7JPC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This just proves that you shouldn't use a computer if you a very tired. You can see that the  other reviews say it is junk, mine didn't even have all the parts so it didn't work at all! The company takes no responsibility after you get through their phone system. Thank God Amazon let me return it.  On a positive note, the packaging was fairly glossy", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wasted Money", "Author": "C. A.

Should have read the reviews like I usually do, instead of being rushed to order it based on 98% positive feedback????  Totally agree with E. Taylor, Steven & James.  Product received did not match the pictures here or at eLoofaimports website.  Cameras had RCA 3 Wire connections (red, white, yellow)--not the single black DC12V.  Cameras don't even match the pictures on box or in the box. Without power to the cameras, they will not work.  The 4Ch DVR is different than picture.  No warranty card in box.  Had previously been opened--so it is not NEW.  Can't open the User Manual on the enclosed software because it is in Word 97 and even XP Professional couldn't convert the graphics.  Spent 4 hours trying just to hook up receiver to DVR to computer. And it can't be hooked up to new flat screen LCD monitors if you don't have RCA cable hook-up.  Ours is a completely digital monitor.  As the sayings go \"BUYER BEWARE\" & \"IF IT SOUNDS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE, etc.\" So the product is a total a waste of our money.", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "do not buy anything from this company", "Author": "James Simmermon", "ReviewID": "R3MKHHPJQY8BCU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i have bought this system .....n it was a waste of time n money.....it was late on shipping, n it was the faster shipping.....then i tryed to install the programs....it wasnt installing ....then i emailed the seller about the problem.... i never got an email back from them or have heard anything....also the their web site isnt a real site... its a fake...DO NOT buy anything from this company....ur better off going to radio shack n spending the few extra $100's for something u know u want .....like i said this company is a rip off!!!", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best wireless DVR cameras out there!", "Author": "Mark Kim \"TechGeekJip\"", "ReviewID": "R29DT2T235PCUS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this unit from eLoofa Imports a few weeks ago, and I simply love it!  Simple all-in-one package, easy to set-up, totally love the functions.The main difference between these units and the others out there is that you can record all four cameras at the same time... I guess the other DVR systems can only record one camera at a time.. I was pleasantly surprised with this units' real time capabilities and quality of video and audio.  Good product for everyone, thanks!", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "waste of money", "Author": "mr widget", "ReviewID": "R2DEQX5CVO2WYW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "ok so the 4 channel wireless video system is worthless, with my cameras less than a few yards away with only one wall seperating it from the receiver, the pictures bounces in and out and barely comes in .  the specs say 150m but man i give this best reception at a few feet.  dont need a wireless to see whats happening a few ft away.. WASTE OF AMERCIAN MONEY ON CHINESE JUNK!  might work in a store where the cameras are all in one room but not a a property where buildings or walls or vehicles are in the way..I GIVE THIS no star rating as i would want to return it but i paint the cameras to mask the bright silver and obvious camera look.. Dam wish i woulda waited ..  dont buy it!  no matter what you think... email me and ill sell you mine for cheap..  keep looking and read reviews! thanks", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Jacked", "Author": "Steven M.

Two of the four cameras seem like their picking up interference from something, but I think it might have been how close they were at the time.
