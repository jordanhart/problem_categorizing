{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Don't make same mistake I did.", "Author": "domin", "ReviewID": "R27F721WLZT0EA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you are thinking of buying this camera with the hope of controlling the pan/tilt/zoom manually by computer or mobile unit you are wrong.  The only way to do it, is by opening the glass dome and physically moving the cameras aim or zoom (if the zooming really works cause I never tried adjusting).  Think of this unit as a regular bullet or a dome camera with incased glass.I am doing this review to warn those would be victim and suffer same consequence I did.  I ended paying for the returned shipping plus 15% restocking fee that this seller will tack on for bench testing this unit(Not a bad earning for a day's work).  A total of $30.00 dollars, or maybe more depending on what state you are from.  Save that money or for that amount, you can buy a cheap bullet or dome camera where you don't haver to remove a glass dome every time you change the aim.Ignore those good reviews or you will end mad for spending the time, effort and money just to test it and come up with the disappointing result.This seller will not specify these feature for what purpose?  I don't know.  You decide.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!UPDATE!  Thank you to Amazon for giving me a complementary refund code for the return shipping I incurred.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "*Manual* Operation Camera", "Author": "aj4mq", "ReviewID": "R1PNHYRLUQ2GP7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Unfortunately, I was expecting this was a Motorized PTZ camera, but it is a Manual PTZ camera, with practically no manual.Camera is a CMOS camera with the IR-shifted spectrum. Means if someone is wearing a black shirt, it will probably appear grey (reflects infrared.) On the other hand, some shoes don't, so they appear black. Blue headlights appear green at night.The company was smart to use hex screws on the ball (T-20's), but they use Phillips screws on the base. This is an easily stealable or modifyable camera. Better be up a distance from the ground.Zoom and Focus - There are 2 short rods behind the camera board,Short: the shorter is the zoomLong: The longer is the focusTo adjust, - turn counter clockwise (top to left) to loosen (about 2 turns) - rotate around primary shaft to adjust (camera's tube) about 60\u00b0 of turn available. - turn clockwise (top to right) to lock position. (keep it from loosing focus or zoom when mounted)Cord is a short 6\" pigtail, BNC & Barrel.Oddly enough, there appears to be enough room within to motorize this unit, which I am definitely planning to do (and needed in the first place.)Delivered very fast, packaging was good.Definitely room in the base to add motors, and I plan to install something similar to the brake cabling system on bicycles. Parallax has the perfect motors (should fit 3 easily, maybe 4.)", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "VidSec", "Author": "heal", "ReviewID": "R838WBQ2VJJ35", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Does not meet expectations,Information is contrary, Says differently in brochure.Item cannot be zoomed as mentioned.
