{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lightning transient surge protector", "Author": "Richard L. Pearson", "ReviewID": "R1K2KIM2CN79L2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchase of these devices is known as closing the barn door after the horses have gotten out.  A nearby lightning strike induced a high voltage/current spike at my business location.  The dumb a~~ fellow that did the design and installation had not provided for this protection. Since the dumb a~~ fellow was me I had to bear the cost of five IR Video Cameras, One expensive computer video card,  one PC with lots of disc and a CARTRIDGE in my surveillance logic tree (cartridge fuse, that is).The ordered surge protectors arrived promptly, were as specified and have been installed along with replacements for above mentioned, fried components.During recent thunder storms I have had my assistant standing across the street from the shop holding an upraised golf club with one hand and a large metal ribbed umbrella in the other. So far no nearby lightning strike has occurred so the effectiveness of the suppressors has not been tested. At this point in time I anticipate that the devices will work as expected.  We shall see.Yoda", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$34.93", "Features": "High-Quality\nEasy-to-use\nReliable", "Name": "COAXIAL SURGE PROTECTOR CABLE END", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41e87BSKxKL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002U1S4EQ"}}
