{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not what I expected", "Author": "SunnyB", "ReviewID": "R31V0RLF44SST9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this as a fun addition to my upcoming wedding. The product arrived 4 days after I ordered it which was amazing. What wasn't amazing was once I opened the package the camera was not securely wrapped to protect it during shipping and it was clearly used. The viewing screen was very scratched up, finger prints covered it along with the camera lense and it had what I hope was dried food on the instruction booklet. The printer did arrive wrapped and secure in it's box but was also used. I did contact the seller to which they provided a shipping label to return it and promised a tracking number of the new camera/printer they would send back. Instead a week later I got an email stating I was being refunded. I'm a bit confused on the breakdown of communication here and why I didn't get a replacement? I now have the case for the printer and quite a bit of film but no camera or printer. So I guess for now I will contact Polaroid and see about getting a new printer. Too bad this didn't work out for me but I hope others have better luck.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Anti-shake stabilization Face tracking, smile and blink detection\nIn camera red-eye removal Audio tag and 32MB built-in storage\nPortable photo printer delivers full-bleed borderless images that are dry to the touch\nFeatures automatic image quality optimization with water-resistant, tear-proof, smudge-proof and peel-off prints\nPrints 2 x 3-inch borderless color images in under a minute Wireless-capable Bluetooth hard drive interface; USB 2.0 hard drive interface", "Name": "Polaroid CPB-1237RB i1237 Camera and POGO Printer Bundle", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31t5LPXEliL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003GDPYIG"}}
