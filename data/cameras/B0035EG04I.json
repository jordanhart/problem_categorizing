{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera with only a couple minor flaws.", "Author": "S. Lancaster \"Happy Daddy!\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q9MMUZ0HGSBC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Replaced another camera with this one to have a sleek, small compact camera to fit in the pocket. I've only had it 3 days, but so far this camera is awesome and worth every penny. Camera has a 4x optical zoom which brings you in plenty close and tons of scene modes! Especially like the Portrait modes that include Beautify, blink detection, smile detection, etc. Wonderful low light photos! Pictures have turned out great and full of color with lots of detail. Build quality is great and feels sturdy! Only two things that could have been improved on. I am a little worried about the small door that covers the charger port, it appears that it could break off easily if not taken care of. Also, when in Movie mode filming, if you use zoom while filming you hear the motor moving the lens.  There is the option to turn sound off while zooming though.  Would love to have had a zoom with sound! Just one more piece of advice for someone buying this camera, make sure to get a Class 6 (minimum Class 4) SDHC card. Any card with a slower speed will make you wait. this is not the camera's fault, just something that comes along with the technology and size of the files! Highly recommended camera if the lose of sound while zooming in movie mode will not bother you!", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Little disappointed", "Author": "J. M. Schmidt", "ReviewID": "R28NZ9F4H30PW0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for only a few days, but so far I'm delighted with it.  The accompanying CD has the manual, (106 pages!) but I was pleased to learn that the camera has a tutorial for many features right on the camera's screen.It is very easy to determine a picture's resolution before taking it.  The camera recommends the resolution for fitting many pictures on an email. Or, increase the resolution for that special shot.At first I wasn't pleased that the camera battery charges in the camera, but now I think it's fine.  And, an external battery charger can be obtained inexpensively.The zoom on the camera is very fast, so it will take some getting used to.  I was very pleased with the macro,and uploaded a picture to display. I agree with the comments I've read on the USB port cover.  It seems very flimsy and I hope it does not break off.I haven't had the opportunity to learn and play with this camera's many features, so I will have to extend this review at a later date.So far, I think this little camera is well worth the money!June 18, 2010I've been using the camera for a while now, and discovered that the camera does NOT allow you to pause video while filming, contrary to the description on Amazon.  That was the main reason I purchased this camera.  Also, the USB port cover wouldn't close, and Samsung support was not helpful. My husband figured out how to fix it.The videos are very good and I'm glad I had this little guy in my bag to capture some special moments.  However, make sure you set the volume to max in the settings, and know that you still won't be able to hear videos well on the camera's replay.I'm still happy with this camera, and now that the price has dropped it's an even better buy.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome if it didn't break", "Author": "Lindsey", "ReviewID": "RYJAWXBX34AZA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased a camera in December for an Christmas gift for a friend. Camera worked awesome for the first month. By Feb 1st the camera was already malfunctioning. Contacted the seller and they wouldnt do anything about it because they only accept returns for 30 days.The camera still operates fine but the lens cover does not open all the way when you power the camera on, therefor you have lines on the top and bottom of the photo.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Little Disappointed", "Author": "Kidzndogz", "ReviewID": "R3IDOH3A5R1ALS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had an older 'SL' model of the Smasung that I wore out. It produced photo's so perfect that I wouldn't consider anything but Samsung again. I have had this camera for just one week. When I uploaded the photo's from this camera I was incredibly disappointed with the color quality. The clarity was great and the noise low, but all the colors look washed out. Comparing these photo's with my  photo's from my older camera, there is no comparison. It took quite a bit of photo editing to get even close to the original color quality of my old camera. It's important to know that 99% of my photo's are Macro of flowers so color is very important to me. I have not used the camera for further distance or action shots.For the money I'm sure the camera is great. I have no other complaints except for the color quality. It is easy to use and understand, light and easy to carry. Maybe a little too thin for me (butterfingers). It works well on a tripod though I found sometimes while setting the tripod up exactly how I wanted it, I would inadvertently press buttons and have to reset before taking the picture. You just have to be more aware of the buttons and not put your thumbs in that area while setting it up.Samsung 12.2MP Digital Camera - Silver (TL105)", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "best so far under $100", "Author": "somoon", "ReviewID": "R1MGIQ8VJRW2ZF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I tried every digital camera at Target and I found it was very fast and easy to use.After I bought it, I tried to shoot a woodpecker up in the tree using optical zoom. When I shot, it looked a little blurry but the picture in the screen was clear. I guess most people choose camera by the brand such as Canon and Nikon, but Samsung camera improved so much that it might be the No.1 point-and-shoot camera. Very satisfied so far.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "xhail2skinsx", "ReviewID": "R1K02MLVFYF4QQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Good:*Digital zoom: one of the few cameras in this price range that has a 5x Digital zoom*4x zoom: still has great zoom along side the digital zoom*HD Video: records in 720p with sound, and shows great on the computer*User Interface: I learned the entire menu system in less than 10 minutes. Easy to use.*High Quality pictures: I bought a 4GB SDHC memory card for my camera, so I am able to put my pictures on the highest quality and will never have to worry about running out of roomThe Bad:*The only feature that I have found to be sub-par is when you are in Night shot mode. After you take the picture, it has to process it to make it look better. However, you have to have a really still hand or put it on a tripod or something. If not, the picture will be blurry.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Returned this camera immediately", "Author": "Trailman", "ReviewID": "R3LBB2PP57JM6X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera on the same day that I left for a trip to Europe, but after trying it out at home I realized that I needed a better product and returned it on the way to the airport. My cell phone (Nexus One) takes better pictures than this camera - seriously.I took a few pictures in my back yard on a sunny day. The colors were washed out, the images were grainy despite the light conditions, and they were out of focus.I do not understand how this product can be rated with 4 or 5 stars. It is no match for my 7 year old 3.5 megapixel Olympus C-740 that I wanted to replace with a smaller and lighter model. I ended up spending $100 more on another product.", "Date": "September 3, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0035EG04I"}}
