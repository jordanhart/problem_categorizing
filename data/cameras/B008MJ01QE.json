McWhorter", "ReviewID": "R1WCJ4OCKNM1PX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am giving this camera four stars because it does take good pictures.  Pictures have good color, saturation, and sharp focus. If you get this camera, you will be able to take good pictures in a variety of conditions, but I must be honest and say there might be better cameras in this price range.What I liked:1) Had it up and taking pictures in under two minutes without reading instructions.2) It does take quality pictures. Sharp focus, good contrast, and brilliant saturation.3) Powerful optical zoom4) Quality optics5) Performs well in low light conditions6) Integrated video capabilityWhat I did not like:1) Geotagging requires integration with smartphone. Other cameras in this price range have a full featured GPS onboard2) Wireless upload confusing and possibly nonfunctional3) Optical zoom/Focus combination is awkward at high zoom levels. In playing with the camera, I constantly \"overshoot\" on the zoom. I found it very difficult to get the level of zoom I wanted without going to far one side or the other.4) Autofocus not as intelligent as in similar priced cameras.This is the bottom line. If you get this camera, you will be able to take excellent digital photographs that you will be proud of, and it is relatively simple to use. The question, however, is whether or not this is the best camera for the money. I have the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V digital camera, and it is at the same price point as this Fujifilm camera. The Sony has an onboard GPS, zoom controls work better, focus works better, and works better in low light condition. At the same price, the sony offers much more bang for the buck.", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Still an underdog against Sony/Canon...", "Author": "Kiyo M.", "ReviewID": "REN1JCN0HNDED", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well, considering I own a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V and Canon PowerShot S100 also, it's hard for me to get overly excited about this Fuji camera - being spoiled with higher standards. Sony/Canon pretty much wins in all aspects. If this was my first digital camera, I'm sure I'd give it a 4 stars... the reason for the 3 stars is that this camera is \"OK\" and for the price, there are better options as well. This camera does have a lot of features, but it also needs a lot of polishing.First of all, I don't know why Fuji has two apps that pretty much does the same thing. For you to download pictures wirelessly to your phone or tablet, you have to download their app. They have two of them called\"FUJIFILM Photo Receiver\" and \"FUJIFILM Camera Application\". The latter is updated more recently and seems like that's all you need. The Photo Receiver app is just redundant. The wireless feature does work and it converts/uploads the pictures to a little under 1 MB.Pros:- Nice camera body/grip and scroll wheel feels good (better than Sony's plasticky feel)- Face detect has a extra touch to it; you can actually save the face with a name/birthday if the camera detects that same face multiple times.- Camera supports over 35 languages! (Canon has 27. Sony only has 4)Cons- Noisy zoom (The zoom noise on the Sony is night and day compared to this one) - when shooting video you will hear the zoom; you can hear this cranking/spring noise. Not good. Sony just blows all digital cameras away in video capabilities.- I'm really not a fan of Fuji's graphic user interface at all. It just seems very outdated. It needs more polish or they need to hire a new graphic artist solely on that.The cross-hair makes it look like a video game. Kids might like this interface, but I'm not a fan of the \"toy\" feel. When you change the mode dial, there is a noticeable delay in the display- In manual mode, there is no real-time preview (like with Sony/Canon) when you adjust the shutter speed/aperture of how the exposure is going to be before even taking the shot - it's only after you take the shot that you see the picture being under or overexposed- No manual whatsoever for video; zooming is much slower in video mode.- The SD card slot is so close to the door that it makes it hard to pull out the cardThe flash does not pop up on its own; you have to manually press the button on the side to pop it out. Since the flash pops up with a hinge, it would have been really cool if the flash still worked tilting it up slightly with your own finger to bounce the light off the ceiling (for more natural light); however, it's not possible because the software won't allow that as the camera won't see that the flash is out unless the flash is directly pointing straight.If you enable silent mode, no shutter sound/operation sound, then you can't use the flash either. So if you want to turn off the annoying operation/shutter sounds, you have to go to those volume sounds and turn them off individually.In playback viewing mode, you can display 1 large photo with (2 previous/next pictures on the side like iPod album scrolling-type preview),  2x2 (with 2 smaller previous/next thumbnails in the corner), 3x3 (9  thumbnails total), and the most is 10x10 (100 thumbnails total on the screen)Turning the wheel to scroll through the photos are fast.If you go to Menu and Configure 2 (the wrench tool with 2; second one from the bottom) and \"screen set-up\", there's a \"monitor sunlight mode\" that raises the LCD brightness really high to make it easier to see when you're outside in harsh sunlight.Overall, I still prefer Sony/Canon's cameras, without a doubt, even though they also have their own flaws. The Fuji camera just needs a little bit more polishing to be done in my eyes.", "Date": "October 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "I can't say enough about how great this camera is", "Author": "LD", "ReviewID": "R2XB15JDPX26FD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THE CAMERAI have several point and shoot cameras. The quality of their photos vary according to how much the cameras let you tweak the settings - if any settings are even available. The FINEPIX F800EXR is slightly wider than my Samsung but has a much larger LCD display. The Samsung is a squared off box whereas the F800EXR is slightly contoured so it feels a lot better in your hand. It has a little weight to it that makes it feel like a solid camera versus a cheap-o plastic one.SETTINGSI usually have to resort to my Samsung (that lets me set the ISO to 400) so I can take photos in dark rooms. Enter my new FINEPIX F800EXR camera from FujiFilm. I am blown away. There are so many settings that it could be intimidating to the novice or casual user but great for an experienced user. I opted to leave it set to the EXR (automated) setting and am I satisfied with its performance! It determines the needed setting from the up-close macro settings to the low-light room that needs higher ISO settings or even the setting that takes three rapid shots and then marries them together to get a brighter/lighter finished photo. The EXR even took some photos in a hallway at 1600 and 3200 ISO that brightened them enough to see the details.PANORAMASI periodically go to events that require me to take a panorama shot of the room. With the Samsung I have to take 2 - 4 shots that I must manually splice together in Photoshop - a tedious job with usable, but unsatisfactory results. Now I set the F800EXR camera to take 120 degree panoramas. So I simply sweep from left to right in the room (being sure to follow the horizontal line placed on the LCD screen). Somehow it knows when you have rotated 120 degrees and automatically stops and saves your panorama. As a side note, it will also take 180 and 360 degree panoramas. There is even a setting to take a seamless 360 degree panorama that can be played in a loop. For all Panorama settings, there is a progress bar that lets you know how much further you have to rotate to reach your desired panorama length.PHOTOSThe photos I took were nice and sharp with only the occasional blurry one - which is a lot better ratio of sharp-to-blurry photos than my other point-and-shoot cameras. I took comparison photos with both my Samsung and the F800EXR using the same ISO settings. I was amazed. I thought the Samsung did good in low-light but the F800EXR's photo was a lot lighter in low-light situations. Usually I get noise (pixelation) under low-light conditions. They almost weren't visible with the F800EXR.MAC USERSYou do not have to install the supplied software. Connect your camera with the supplied USB cable and immediately Image Capture pops up and starts displaying all of your photos and videos - ready to be copied to your Mac.IPAD USERSCamera Connection Kit:I attached the \"Camera Connection Kit\" to my iPad 2, then connected the F800EXR's USB cable to the camera and to the Camera Connection Kit. I turned both on and immediately the pictures on the F800EXR showed up in the Photos App on my iPad. I selected the ones I wanted and successfully copied them to the iPad. No Wi-Fi connection was needed.WI-FI:I downloaded both the recommended \"FujiFilm Camera Application\" and the \"FujiFilm Photo Receiver\" Apps and installed them on my iPad. I was able to download only one image with the \"FujiFilm Camera Application\" and nothing with the \"FujiFilm Photo\" app. I had to continually reselect the F800EXR's name in the iPad's WI-FI settings for both. I finally gave up. So for me, WI-FI is a no-go. At least the USB cable works.FINAL THOUGHTSAm I satisfied? You bet! The F800EXR has now moved up to be my primary camera. If perfect photos are more enticing to you than fiddling with settings, use the EXR setting. But if you do like to manually tweak the settings, there are tons to chose from.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wireless fail", "Author": "John S. Dean \"John\"", "ReviewID": "R1LDBS5DB3ESRZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I wanted to love this camera.  I really did.  I came into this probably more inclined to give it every chance than I normally would with a Vine offering, because the things it claimed it could do were just awesome - geotagging based on data from the phone, wireless transfer, 20x optical zoom.  Nice screen in the back.  A great (for me) form factor, easy to grip.  Fuji had to do very little to get a good review from me, I thought.  About all they had to do was show up.Unpacked it, charged the battery.  It's easy to remove and insert the battery, and there's an orange stripe on the battery that matches the orange release button under the cover - makes it easy to see which way the battery goes without having to peer inside to see where the contacts are.Powered it up, ran through the initial setup for language and time, and started playing some with the menu.The menu is not very intuitive.  And the manual is horrible.  It gives a list of what options there are in the menus, but not how to get to them.  Some are only available in certain modes, and some you don't get at all just scrolling through the menus - you have to click LEFT on the \"d-pad\" type button, then get to the little wrench icons to get at the others.  I finally found that just by trying it and hoping.  This was my first Fuji camera so I don't know if that's how they all are or not.  But it was frustrating.I sat on my couch and took some random photos of my great room.  The low light pictures are actually very well done, even on the screen, you can see the image much brighter than you see in front of you in real life.  The colors match reality on the viewfinder, something I often don't see in digital cameras (I go through them every year or two, so I've been through a bunch - this one seems to color match on the viewfinder better than any of the others I've had).Image stabilization - in low light very very poor.  No matter how steady I held it things would blur.  Even with the camera resting on the arm of the chair, taking a picture across the room of my kid's bookshelf and most of the time they were blurred somewhat.  Using a flash let it snap fast enough to keep it from blurring, but my Nikon, taking the same shot in the same light without flash was able to take the pictures without blur.  EXR mode gives a better percentage of low light images not blurred from bad stabilization, and changing around to other modes get me a couple that are not blurred, but I expected much better from this when compared to other cameras I've used in similar light that had no problems with stabilization and lower light shots indoors using just room lighting.  I didn't play with any manual setting options, it's been decades since my 35mm days, and I'd probably just make things worse, so my testing was with automatic modes, since most of the people who are going to look at a camera like this are people like me, who want a simple point and shoot camera.  For people with a more professional or advanced background, if there's specific things you want me to try to test, ask in the comments and I'll do what I can.Zoom - very nice - less than 2 seconds from 1x to 20x, and less than 2 seconds back to 1x.  In movie mode, it does not zoom anywhere near that fast, it's 9 seconds to go to full optical zoom during movies.  Things are nice and crisp at 20x just much easier to blur your shot with movement due to the image stabilization issues.  But the slower movie mode zoom may be useful for people with a tendency to go nuts zooming in and out while taking movies...  Would be nice though if there was an option to adjust it though.Movie mode - there's a separate movie mode button on back right near where your thumb rests, so you can instantly enter movie mode without having to change modes or touch the dial on top.  While taking normal pictures, hitting that button has you taking movies in less than a second.  It also gives you a timer that counts down backwards how much recording time is left on the current card.Flash - manual release only - doesn't pop up if needed.  If you think there's any chance you'll need a flash, either due to darkness or just to fill in light, you have to eject it manually.  When I saw that the entire left top section to the left of the hump in the middle comes up, I thought, \"Oh great, another camera that screws up how you can hold that side with your left hand while taking pictures.  But it actually doesn't cause problems because of how it pops up and forward some.  The entire back half of that section is open for your finger.  It's a HOLLOW spot of course since it's empty with the flash extended, but you have the left and rear edge of that hole, which gives you plenty of grip if you like to use both hands.The place it utterly failed though was anything having to do with the wireless connect.  Plain and simple, it could not.  While looking for a manual online (I'm on a Retina Macbook Pro with no optical drive by default so was looking for an online manual) I found a firmware update 1.01 for it.  VERY easy to do, just download and copy the DAT file to the memory card, insert in camera and power on camera while holding the DISP/BACK button.  Shows current version and lets you update it just right there.  And this is evidently there to rectify an issue with wireless connect.  However, the problem they outlined as the problem this was intended to fix wasn't my problem.So the wireless share is absolutely horrible - totally unusable with my third generation iPad or my iPhone 5.  First, you have to get the camera into playback mode.  Then you have to turn on the wireless connect option on the camera.  It goes into \"search mode\" and this is where the fail is.  *NOW* in the very short time it is in search mode, you have to go to your phone, go to settings, wireless, find the Fuji wireless network the camera is broadcasting, select it, then open the Fuji connect app and click \"connect\".  9 times out of 10 despite me having both apps running (and quick switching between them with a double click on the home button) the connect doesn't happen before the camera times out.  The 10th of those 10 times I get a quick flash for a split second on the camera showing my iPhone and connected, then instant disconnection.  This is AFTER the 1.01 update for the firmware.  This is just a horrible setup.And of course it's the same for the geotagging - you have to set the phone to use the camera as it's wireless access point before shooting.  This one actually gave me enough time to connect my iPhone to it and enable geotagging.  I had hoped once I had that connected I could then try to wireless connect, but I had to go back to trying to pick the camera as the access point again, and was back at the beginning of my problems outlined above.  It would've been better had they reversed this - had the app on the phone act as a little access point for the camera to look for and connect to, rather than the other way.And every time you want to try again, it's not keeping the camera on that already connected Fuji camera wireless network - every time it fails, you have to start ALL OVER from the very beginning, back to wireless, back to finding the fuji and selecting it, back to the fuji app to try again.And the option on the phone to browse the camera, same problems.  There is nothing in this wireless connection that works well.  Absolutely nothing, and that was the one thing that set this camera apart from my Nikon.  But without it, as much as I really wanted to love this camera, there's nothing at all to set this above my existing camera other than the physical aspects I liked.And I'd also be more interested in wireless transfer directly to my computer, but that is not an option, at least not yet.  I hope that if they work to resolve the mess they made of their wireless transfer procedure, they add options to get software for the computer as well.Now, back to a few other good things.RAW format - it's been a while since I had a camera that supported RAW, so that's a nice feature for people who need it.The camera has great heft without being heavy - not as light as my Nikon so it actually feels better to hold.  Very ergonomic, with the flared front grip for the fingers, and a pushed out part on the back right under the selection dial for the thumb, with non slip in both locations.The zoom button is easy to hit, but the notches on it to provide a non-slip surface are just too rounded, don't grip enough.  Sometimes your finger may slide around a bit on it.Bright screen, easy to see.  And I love the display and how it gives a big graphic when you switch modes, the right half of the screen shows a graphic of a big selector knob showing not just what you selected, but what ones are a couple above and below it.  And the left side gives the details about the mode and what it is used for.When the camera is off, hitting the playback button gives you the playback display and keeps the lens retracted, and simply pressing the shutter button switches it on for normal camera mode again.I haven't beat it up yet to see just how long the battery will last since I've spent most of my time playing with the kludgy menu and the awful wireless options, but with about 150 photos taken so far, a couple three minute movies, and lots of flash photos, my battery meter hasn't dropped enough to take one of the three bars off the power icon.  And when I'm not taking photos I've got it turned on this whole time so far.  So up to this point, the battery life really seems like it's going to be good.From power on, it's only about 1 to 1.5 seconds before you're shooting.  Very quick startup.Lens cover built in, but not solid.  It's very delicate, and it can be easily nudged open so something to be aware of, make sure there's nothing floating around in your case if there's not a separate section for the camera body.There is a nice, solid mount on the bottom for tripods and such, well secured, and I had no wiggle at all with mine when I tried it on my tripod.There is a mini HDMI output, but I don't have any mini HDMI cables so I couldn't try it out.  I use a media center PC for my TV anyway, with a server in the basement that it reads photos from, so for me it wouldn't have been used anyway.Oddly enough, the USB cable it comes with doesn't seem to work with my Mac running Mountain Lion.  It's recognized right away, and it opens my transfer program, but the program can't see any photos on the camera.  If I pull the SD card out and insert it into my Mac, it sees the images just fine.  That's how I'd do it anyway, so for me it's not an issue, but something to check if you're using a Mac and need that functionality.  Test it to make sure you can pull the images off of it via cable.It comes with a pretty standard low end wrist strap.The button to release the flash is on the left edge, and there's no chance you're going to accidentally open the flash - it takes considerable force (for a camera) to release the flash.Now, for the most important thing ultimately - actual end results.  Picture quality is very good.  Some shots are just excellent, looking at them on my Retina Macbook.  Even the 20x zoom shots taken across the room are just outstanding for 20x zoom shots.  I have some test photos I did of my 8 year old's book shelf on the other side of the room.  I'll post them over the next few days when I get a chance.  Close up shots are impressive.  I have one I took with the camera held at about a 45 degree angle, the bottom edge of the lens actually touching a piece of paper, and it took a great shot of the words on the paper from that nearly nonexistent distance.  Shots taken with the continuous setting work well also.  The microphones pick up sound better than my other P&S; cameras, and movies had a better, fuller sound to them.I'm going to keep trying to see if I can ever get the wireless transfer to work, and will edit this post with notes on the results, as well as more impressions as I get some more shots in various settings.For the camera itself, I'd give it a 4 star rating just for the camera only side of things, but since this is marketed as a camera with wireless image transfer, and it just is horrible, I'm going to score it based on that, hence the rating of a 2.Edit 4/22/13 - It's been 7 months since this review, so I thought I'd visit it again and update.  No change.  Firmware is still the same version, the software has gotten no better on the iphone.  Still have to jump between network settings on the iPhone to try to connect to the phone's \"access point\" and then back to the app to start anything, and it still times out before anything can happen.  I had hoped maybe they'd update the firmware to help change things to make it reliable but apparently not.  I've been using the Nikon S8200 happily instead of this, and today  got a new Sony NEX-3NL/B interchangeable lens digital camera that I'm so far extremely happy with , so this Fuji will just end up thrown out since I have only been keeping it as a spare \"backup\" digital camera in case the Nikon had a problem, and now the Nikon has become the backup camera so no need to waste space with this unit.  Too bad as this had a lot of potential, but between the really bad \"intelligent Image stabilization\" and lackluster \"everything else\", it's just not a camera I'd ever bother using despite how much I do like the body and grip and how secure it feels to hold.", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Some interesting options in a high quality camera", "Author": "Evan Jacobs", "ReviewID": "RAZ82ETPR4RDX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been playing with this camera for about a month now and I wanted to pass along my impressions.  For a bit of perspective, I'm a bit of a camera hoarder (according to my wife).  I have cameras from a Canon EOS 5D Mark II to the Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W3.  What I've been looking for is a small, versatile travel camera that captures RAW format images.  This Fuji camera is a good contender.  Its size is a bit larger than my sub-compact point and shoot cameras but still much smaller and lighter than my big SLR.  It's a fixed lens camera but the zoom performs well and offers a lot of options.  The panorama mode works well and delivers great results quickly (although the iPhone does it now too).This camera has some interesting features involving connecting via wifi to an iPhone app.  You can GPS tag your location, download photos while you're on the road using only your camera and iPhone, etc.  All these features work however, it's not as quick a process as I would like.  You spend a few minutes linking your camera to your phone and then sometimes the information comes across, other times it doesn't.  It's all just a bit clunky.  Yes, it works.  But I wish it was a little more elegant.For the core camera functions, this camera delivers very nice images and is quick to use.One major complaint at the moment is that Fuji hasn't published a RAW interpreter for their special format on Mac.  So if you're a Mac user like me, core apps like Photoshop, Aperture, and iPhoto won't recognize your RAW files.  I've been shooting RAW+jpeg so I'm covered.  I assume that a RAW plug-in for Mac will be forthcoming, Fuji?  Right now, your only options are a virtual PC or 3rd party apps that can convert the RAW files to DNG.  Lame.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Overall the camera produces good to very good pictures, has a lot of easily accessible options, but there are some shortcomings.", "Author": "austin_Larry", "ReviewID": "RM92BTB9LWXLO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The F800EXR produces some very good results, if you are willing to take some time to explore and play with all the features and options. But there are some noticeable shortcomings that depending on the user may or may not be significant.  Rather than go feature by feature, I will spell out the pros and cons I have found and some of the things I like best and worse about the 800EXR.Pros:* Great build quality. The feel, look, and solidness of the camera is very noticeable. It feels great to hold and use.* Very easy to use menu with a main button and 2 function keys. When you change shooting modes it is very easy to access the different options that then become available to you. There is a main menu button then a function key. There is also an fn `shortcut' key that works in some modes that gives you quick access to say changing the film ISO. Taken together after a little use, very easy to get to a wide range of options. Very well done.* Useful and a good variety of shooting mode options. I will list my favorites.* The EXR mode is a fully automatic mode and for quick shots has been producing good reults. It has some sub-options: EXR Auto, resolution priority, High ISO and low noise, and D-Range priority. I generally use the EXR Auto but the D-Range is good for bright shots outdoors.* Program AE. I use this mode a lot. It is fully programmed for shutter speed and aperture but gives you quick access to ISO and White balance (there are a number of preset white balance modes, such as florescent lighting), and various options for Auto Focus. I overall use this the most.* Scene Mode.  The range of options is impressive. Many standard options that you have probably had on previous point and shoot cameras. But there were some new ones for me. There is a `Cat' scene mode and a `Dog' scene mode for instance. We only have cats and the cats didn't seem to mind or was there a noticeable difference in Dog mode. Some of the modes though are very helpful. I talk more about this mode below, but Indoor Party mode is very useful.* Advance Mode. A very strong feature of the 800EXR. You will find many useful options here. There are the 6 advanced filters mentioned in the product description above. But there is also a very good panorama mode that you can do up to 360 degrees. Also something called Pro Focus which I love. I had been looking for this in a point and shoot. It will produce a sharp portrait with a blurred background. There is a Pro Low Light mode that does give decent photos indoors as long as there is enough light from windows or lamps, flash is disabled in this mode. There are also options for selecting a particular color to be reproduced and all other colors are monochrome. So you have some greens, but everything else is monochrome if you choose the green option.* Very good wireless transfer to smartphones.  I had an iPhone 4 and these are the steps. You need to download the Fujifilm Camera Application. To wirelessly download pictures you can select up to 30 photos (but not videos). The camera will set up its own local wireless network that you connect to. After connecting you go to the Fujifilm app and select connect. The pictures will then download. It has worked for me dozens of times smoothly each time. I may have to connect a couple of times but it always works.* Very good on camera in real time red eye reduction. Best red eye reduction I have ever seen in a camera and it will do it in real time and save the corrected photo.* You can enter video mode with the push of a button rather than having to change the picture shooting mode you are in.Cons:* Depending upon the lighting conditions and the mode you have selected it is very easy to get pictures with too much noise in them. While the EXR generally produces very good photos, under indoor conditions you often have to use other modes. Indoor shooting is also challenging because the flash is very limited. It has a narrow effect and doesn't illuminate much beyond 5 or so feet. To get good indoor shots beyond 5 feet or a larger area the most success I had was in the Scene or SP mode. There is an option for Indoor Party. You lose control of most options once that is chosen but it does produce decent indoor shots with people or items illuminated beyond five feet. There is also the Pro \"Low Light\" mode that works well as long as you have a medium or what I would call normal amount of indoor light.* As mentioned above the flash is very limited. It doesn't go very deep or wide. It also takes a noticeable amount of time to recycle. More than other digital cameras I have used. The one advantage of the flash is that if you want say a picture of a child and you are up close to them. You can get a good picture with everything else dark.* The display while good seems to extenuate noise. At first I thought I was getting consistently bad shots because they looked grainy and noisy on the screen. But after downloading to smartphone or computer they were actually good usable shoots. Something to keep in mind.* One of the most annoying short comings is during video shooting. You can zoom in and out, but there is a very noticeable sound in your video when you do this. I have the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model) another camera in the same class as the 800EXR. This does not happen with the Sony.* Autofocus is not as fast or as consistent as the Sony. Overall the autofocus does a fine job, but you will end up missing some shots. It gets confused at times and also is not quite as quick as the Sony. Of course if the flash hasn't cycled to back on any indoor picture needing flash is not going to be good. I have the Nixon P7000. The autofocus there got noticeably better after a firmware update. I did update to firmware 1.1 but I am going to be keeping my eye out for more firmware updates.* Video quality is very good outside just good inside. Decent video inside but having the Sony I mentioned above, that camera takes exceptional indoor video. Better than any dedicated Camcorder I have ever had.  Better than the 800EXR.* No wireless option for downloading to a computer. You can only download to a smartphone or tablet, not a computer.Overall this is a fine camera that has a lot of easily accessible and useful options. After taking some time to look through each program mode and all the options I found it pretty easy to get good to very good shots. Some shots can be a bit `noisy' depending upon the options you have chosen, but overall I am pleased with color saturation, sharpness, picture quality, and detail. The Sony camera I mentioned above overall for me is a more complete product. Primarily because of better video, slightly better outdoors, better indoors, and much less noise from zooming. Photo wise though you can get some very rich and vibrant photos from the 800EXR. But the Sony also produces a bit crisper, more vibrant, and accuurate picture. The 800EXR is very good, just a tad below.At a family gathering or during a vacation, because of the superiority of the video and slightly better overall picture detail of the DSC-HX30V I would have to give it the nod. I feel like I have pictures AND video covered in my pocket with the Sony. With the 800EXR video is ok indoors nothing more and both indoors and outdoors if you zoom in video mode you will get an annoying noise. Overall, because of the satisfying pictures most of the time, the 800EXR gets a definite recommend from me, especially if you don't feel that zoom noise during video shooting will be a major drawback for you.", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "A lot of functions crammed into a small package--maybe too many", "Author": "Ursiform", "ReviewID": "RGCXVVVSK1U8X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fuji has a reputation for good digital cameras, and this one live up to it. They've managed to pack a 20x optical zoom (25-500 mm equivalent) in to a small, attractive, easy to hold package. The pictures it takes are very good for a small camera with a small sensor. They don't match my DSLR, but that would be asking too much. This is a camera to carry around, not lug around. It's a little larger than my cell phone, but takes much better pictures. It has a decent flash for indoor and low light shots, although you have to manually pop it up.The camera has both an auto mode and an \"EXR\" mode, which is also auto, but allows the camera to make a wider range of choices about a picture. It seems to work very well; I suspect most people in the market for a good pocket camera would be perfectly happy never leaving this mode. It also has aperture and shutter priority modes as well as a full manual mode. There is a scene selection mode and a program mode. Finally, there is an advanced mode, which is sort of a special effects mode.As all digital images are reconstructed from partial image information, the reconstruction can be altered to change the look of the image. For example, this camera can be set to mimic several film types, effectively varying color balance and saturation in ways similar to those film types. The advanced mode takes you beyond this, allowing you to add effects like extreme color saturation, blur like in a toy camera, or even black and white except for a single color rendered in color. For the most part these are things to play with in a camera like this; if you are serious about these sorts of effects you'll probably want a bigger camera and to add these effects in a photo editing program. Consider the B&W; with a single color modes. First, if you use red mode you'll get all reds in the scene in red, not just the object of interest. Further, you are limited to what the camera chooses to call red, which might not match your choice. I took a picture of two red roses on a rose bush in this mode, and parts of the two roses weren't red enough to make the filter. Had I been able to choose for myself I would have chosen differently. I will say the panorama mode is cool.This does bring me to one thing I don't like about this (or most compact digital) cameras: no viewfinder. Yes, my start in photography long predates digital. And I mostly use a DSLR, so I'm not as accustomed to framing with the display as many people. But with a long zoom it is hard to hold the camera out so that you can see the display and hold it steady as you try to frame; with a viewfinder you can brace the camera against your face to steady it. And the display is hard to see in bright sun, as are all displays.While the camera being small is good in principle, and the design makes it easy to hold despite its size, there are drawbacks. The buttons are small and it's sometimes hard to press in the right place. The SD card is hard to extract because it is right against the door. Size is a trade off.The printed manual is minimalist, but probably good enough for someone with experience with digital cameras. The CD has the full manual; interestingly, it is formatted in the same small, square page format as the printed manual, as if it had been intended as a printed manual.For someone looking for a small camera with wide to tele zoom capability that takes good pictures at a decent price, the F800EXR is a good choice, even if you never explore the odd modes. If you want a relatively inexpensive camera to play around with, there is a lot to play with on this one. The various modes might also make it good for a child with an interest in photography. Keep in mind this is a very competitive camera category, so be sure to look into competing models before buying.", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Camera Yet", "Author": "Donald Rodriquez", "ReviewID": "R2QOQGQIZWZRYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The zoom is fabulous, the geotagging is great and wireless transfer is a great feature and easy to use.

Its sleek and rounded form makes it seems slimmer than the Sony, and it has a rubberized finish which makes it feel great to hold, compared to the Sony.There's a beautiful display, mini HDMI and mini USB outputs (but no mini HDMI cable), a dedicated movie button, 20x optical zoom, 40x digital zoom, WLAN connectivity that lets you transfer images wirelessly to your smartphone or tablet, geotagging information from your smartphone, high-speed continuous shooting of up to 11 frames per second, full 1080 movie mode, 320 fps movie mode, external battery charger, RAW mode, multiple exposure, and the usual bells and whistles such as various filters, face recognition, etc.At its highest optical zoom, the video produced is definitely a little more jittery than that of the Sony, which is silky smooth. You'll atleast see micro-jitters if handheld. And at this zoom, it also takes longer to focus than the Sony.However, zoomed in camera mode, when it succeeded, it sometimes took clearer pictures than the Sony. The 40x digital zoom mode can produce some pretty usable, detailed pictures, although you will see some pixelating and watercolor effect. By detailed, I mean you can read off a photo of a printed page at 15 feet.Low-light performance is also pretty impressive, seemingly able to gather extra light from the surroundings which don't appear to the naked eye. Low-light zoom can also produce some detailed pictures, although of course not noise free.However, in low light, it seemed to take more blurry shots than the Sony.The 320 fps mode can be fun, and is not found on the Sony. This mode can make even dripping faucets fun! Note, however, that filming at this speed is done in a super-widescreen mode, and at low-res 320x240 (see sample video).The multiple exposure mode is a strange feature. I thought I would be able to insert different people into the same picture, but you would need a tripod for that - it's much too hard to line up the shot exactly the same the next time, and you get a ghostly image of everything instead. To use this mode effectively you would need to take pictures that don't require the same background lined up twice.The wifi transfer is restricted to tablets and smartphones, not to your PC - bummer. The process is finicky: you'll have to start the wifi transfer on the camera, connect your tablet to the camera's wifi network, press Connect on the tablet app ... I often failed to do all the steps needed before the camera timed out. If you succeed, there is an option to transfer images scaled down to 3MB or left at original size.There is a Fn button which is mappable to certain favorite settings like ISO, image size, image quality, RAW, Dynamic Range (couldn't tell if this worked, because there is no UI feedback for this one), face recognition, etc.Unfortunately, burst mode isn't one of the options - you'll need to use the F-mode button for that, select Continuous, etc. It could have been easier. When in continuous mode, it can take ten seconds or more (using a Class 10 card) to store the image. Same for Best Frame Capture mode, which lets you press the shutter halfway, then keeps a user-defined number of shots before and after the shutter is fully pressed.The dedicated movie button means that it starts recording as soon as you press it - there's no \"movie mode\". Pressing the shutter from Playback or movie mode gets you back to photo mode.It doesn't have built-in geotagging - you need to connect it to your smart device.All in all, this camera succeeds at most things. Mostly great pics in Auto and EXR modes, great video. The most noticeable shortcoming is the jittery zoomed video. However, you may want to consider the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model), which does have built-in GPS, better anti-shake, faster zoomed focus, and wifi transfer to PC.", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little point and shoot camera with some advanced functions", "Author": "Colin Brown \"Colin Brown Microsoft MVP\"", "ReviewID": "R1Z7HUDOVYV4GM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The first thing that strikes you about the Fujifilm F800EXR camera is how small it actually is for having such a huge zoom on it.  Cameras these days have so many features on them (and this one is definately no exception) that you can't review everything that it does.  I'm not a professional photographer but more of a keen amateur so this camera to me is something that is small and compact and you would use on holidays or nights out to take point and shoot photographs and not have to worry too much about settings.For that purpose Fuji has included 2 automatic modes, EXR mode and auto.  Both are fully automatic with EXR going through an image processor to give you slightly sharper pictures.  This camera has an amazing optical zoom of 20X (optical zoom being much better than digital) and can zoom as much as 69X (depending on mode) with image stabalization which is certainly needed at the higher zoom levels.  The lens is has a wider initial angle than other recent point and shoot cameras that I own, meaning that you get more into the picture without having to back way up to fit it all in (sometimes this is impractical so the wider angle lens is a boon).I took one of my recent Canon point and shoot cameras to Marshal Space Flight Center in Huntsville for a comparison test with this Fuji.  Taking exactly the same shot in Canon's equivalent to Fuji's modes.  The canon is a 14.1Mp camera compared to this cameras 16Mp but this comparison was all about the lens, image processing, modes and how easy it was to take pictures.  In virtually every category the Fuji was better.  (Unfortunately these reviews don't allow me upload pictures inline so I could illustrate the differences, but believe me Fuji was better).The F800EXR produces sharp, well detailed photographs in high light and low light conditions. A backlit subject is slightly different in that the Fuji's flash does not automatically deploy. This is something you have to do manually by pressing a small button on the side of the camera. In most cases the camera will warn you through an icon on the LCD panel that using flash is recommended but I found that this isn't always the case, especially when a backlit subject.  If you want to be sure you can always raise the flash, just remember to close it again after taking your shots as this appears to the weak point and I could see the flash/camera getting damaged if you don't.Talking about the flash, it has the multi-flash/red-eye reduction mode, standard flash and is effective in shorter distances without washing out the picture but its not powerful enough to be used over longer distances.  The effective distance is probably somewhere around 20-25ft.The camera has many different modes including landscapes, portraits (both soft and sharp), face tracking, both cat and dog modes to highlight animals features etc. Basically a mode for most situations you would use this camera. Accessing these functions is really easy and quick although this can't be said of all the functions on the camera, especially when you go into full program mode (which lets you override virtually every setting).You can choose the size and quality of images you take (most people will leave this set at fine and high res but the choices are there if you need them) and the camera also records video at full 1080p.  There is a small flap to the side where you can connect the camera directly to your hi-def TV using HDMI and display your pictures or view your video directly on your TV.Battery wise, its not the longest lasting battery I've ever seen in a camera lasting roughly 450-500 images (depending on use of flash).  It would be well worth it to buy an extra battery to keep on hand just in case.Other excellent features of the camera is the ability to transfer images wirelessly to another device such as your computer, tablet or even phone. Fuji has a software download you load on the device then its as simple as picking the images you want to transfer and thats it.  Very easy to use and a great way to instantly upload images to facebook or send them to friends using SMS on your phone.There is also a way to hook your phones GPS into the camera so that images are geo-tagged. This does work but its not the greatest method of doing it or the easiest I've every seen but again, the option is there if you want to use it.One feature that has saved my pictures a few times is the ability for the camera to take multiple images then combine them in memory to give you the sharpest and best lit photo. This is an excellent feature.Macro mode (shooting close up images) on this camera is excellent, allowing you to zoom right in on an object and it still turn out sharp. One of the best Macros I've seen on a point and shoot.If you live panoramas the camera allows you take them ranging from 120 degrees to a full 360 degree panorama in any direction (vertically and horizontally). The camera takes multiple images and automatically stitches them together for you with the onscreen guide making them very easy to take.I could go on and on about the different features on this camera as there are so many of them but suffice to say that if you are looking for a small camera that you can just slip into your pocket, with a lot of features and an amazing zoom (20X optical and upto 69X digital) then you could do a lot worse than this camera.I am however going to take one star off for the flash (having to manually deploy rather than it being automatic) and setting up all the options in program mode isn't the easiest I've used on a camera.Overall a great little point and shooter.", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible Fujifilm F800EXR 16MP Digital Camera", "Author": "B.

Although just as everyone is different so are cameras therefore you can't get it all because enough is never enough. I am a novice photographer and it has many features that will take time to understand and use. So far its been a good camera, it takes clear pictures even at far distances. Drawback is that the instruction book is in Japanese only, but it contains a cd that you can upload the English instruction manual. Personally I prefer an English manual over a cd because I prefer to have a book when I need it quickly. I ordered the camera and used it once and then the next time I used it the shutter wouldn't completely open, therefore it could have either been factory damage or damage from the distance it came from. Order came all the way from Japan to Jersey therefore it made a long trip. Either way I was worried because I didn't want to spend so much money on repairs when I barely even used it and I wasn't at fault. I contacted the seller immediately and surprisingly they answered quicker than I thought basically the next day, which made me feel better because I felt like I could get the help I needed and in a timely manner.

In my eyes, that's only slightly easier than just taking out the SD card.Second, I'm a big \"non-ideal lighting conditions\" shooter. This is not the camera for you if you're taking pictures in non-sunny day environments. The pictures that the camera produces even at the base ISO100 are noisy.  Say goodbye to any sort of detail retention at the higher ISOs.

Amith (kndy)", "ReviewID": "R193B50D2ACG8H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My latest review is for the FujiFilm FinePix F800EXR, FujiFilm's first F-series camera to incorporate Wi-Fi Wireless Image Transfer with the ability to transfer photos you take from your camera directly to your Android or iOS smartphone or tablet.  And also a camera that features a powerful 1/2 16 MegaPixel EXR-CMOS sensor and FUJINON 20x Wide-Angle long-zoom lens (@5-500mm) and has a 3-inch high contrast 460K resolution LCD.Let's begin the review:I.  What comes in the package:- Digital Camera F800EXR- Rechargeable battery NP-50A- Battery Charger- Hand strap- USB cable- CD-Rom (software/manual)II.  FIRST IMPRESSIONS & FIRST THOUGHTS:My first impressions of this camera was that it's small and sleek.  Immediate things that came to my mind was purchasing a protective case for this camera and possibly a protector for the LCD screen, as it is not a flip LCD screen.  So, you don't want to have it laying on a table or anywhere the LCD screen can get scratched up.The buttons are convenient and scroll wheel was easy to use.The pop-up Flash is one of those type that extends by a push of a side button, but has extensions, which are plastic and can be fragile. You definitely want to make sure children are not handling this camera as they may snap it off or have the flash ejected and forget to push it down and it getting broken if put inside a bag.  So, take good care of the flash.The battery needs to be recharged first, but I like the convenient battery recharger.  Although I prefer to have AA rechargeable batteries for my digital cameras, the F800EXR uses a NP-50A battery which is not commercially available but according to FUJIFILM's website, they recommend purchasing a NP-50 battery and the good news is that aftermarket batteries range from $8 to official batteries that are around $20, so, they are not too expensive.The camera has a mini-HDMI port and for its USB connection, it uses a small USB port to the side of the camera for downloading directly to your computer.III.  THE TESTI spent three days testing the F800EXR digital camera.  Testing out various light levels and the ISO and its many functions.The camera features the following functions:- Automatic Mode- EXR Mode- Program AE- Shutter Priority AE- Aperture Priority AE- Manual Mode with Shutter Speed and Aperture- Portrait Mode- Advanced Mode - Using filters, panorama, etc.The camera for the most part was easy to figure out.  For those who are new to using a camera, there is an included manual on the CD but for those familiar with camera settings.  You are given a choice of:FILM SIMULATION - Provia/Standard, Velvia/Vivid - landscape and nature, Astia/Soft - Softer colors, more subdued look, B&W;, SepiaIMAGE SIZE: (Long) 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 (Medium) 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 (Short) 4:3, 3:2, 16:9IMAGE QUALITY: Fine and NormalISO - on Automatic mode,you are given an ISO 400, 800, 1600, 3200 / EXR mode gives you the 100, 200, 400, 800 but on other modes, I saw the ISO going up as high as 6400 and 12800.RAW - This camera has a RAW mode in which the files are saved as .RAF.  It's important to note that at this time, I was unable to open this EXR version of .RAF files on Lightroom 4, CS6.  With that being said, included with the software is SILKYPIX's RAW FILE CONVERTER EX which allows you to open .RAF files and export them as hi-res JPG files.*****UPDATE - 10/3/2012******Adobe has released Lightroom 4.2 and Adobe Raw and DNG Converter 7.2 which now works with the the F800EXRPLAYBACK MENU:#1 - Allows for wireless image transfer, location navigator, photobook assist, image search, erase, mark for upload to, slide show#2 - Allows for red eye removal, protecting, cropping, resize, image rotate, copy and voice memo.#3 - Erase Face Recog., Print Order, Disp AspectSETUP MENU:#1 - Date, time difference, language, reset, silent mode, geotagging set-up, sound setup#2 - Screen set-up, power management, IS mode, red eye removal, intelligent digital zoom, AF illuminator, FILE FORMATS: JPG, RAW, RAW+JPG and 3D Still Image:MPO compliant#3 - Save Data Set-Up, Video System, Wireless Setting, Demonstration, FormatADVANCED SETTINGS:Advanced Filters - Toy Camera: Allows for black vignetting on corners, shaded borders and nostalgic effect, Miniature: Allows top and bottom blur for diorama effect, Pop - Emphasizes contrast and color saturation, HIGH-KEY: Enhanced brightness and reduced contrast, Dynamic Tone - Fantasy effect, Partial Color Red, Blue, Yellow, Green, Orange and Purple:Panorama 360 - Very easy to use and it works correctly!  You can easily set the direction of the panorama...starting from left or right, up or down.Pro Focus - If you need that bokeh in the background.Pro-Low Light - Clarity of still subjects in very low-lightMultiple Exposure - Images taken twice and super imposed.  Shoot once, move around and shoot again.  I like it!3D image - 3D image from 2 shots with each individual shutter.F-MODE BUTTON - This allows you to quickly change your ISO, image size, continuous shooting, film simulation but most interesting is the landmark navigator and geotagging setup.DISPLAY BUTTON - This allows you to set information on screen on or off, best framing, HD framing and histogram.TEST: Outdoor photos using shutter speed, aperture and all modes.Photos were vibrant.  I was very impressed with how crisp and clear the images were turning out.  The motion detection was very good.  Great stabilization and the new motion detect capability worked remarkably well.EXR HR (High Resolution) priority mode allows the sensor to utilize all 16 megapixels for high quality resultsEXR DR (Dynamic Range) priority mode allows you to take two pictures and combine them to provide a wide dynamic range up to 1600%EXR SN (Signal to Noise) priority mode allows for pixels to be doubled up for increased sensitivity and better results in low-light.TEST: Advanced Mode - Advanced mode seem to work rather well. I have my camera set at RAW but for Panoramic 360 mode, it took it at JPG. But for those who want to be creative will enjoy this many filters and modes.  Panoramic allows for high resolution at 180, 240 or 360 degree ranges.TEST: FLASH - Flash seemed to work very well, but you need to give it a few seconds before you can use it again.  I was shooting indoors, shot with flash, shot again, flash didn't go off.  Third time it worked.  And tested this and I realized the flash does take a few seconds to recharge itself.TEST: Zoom - This camera has a 20x zoom, but how good is it?  Well, to get the long distance shot, I had to set the AF mode from center to tracking.  And saw a telephone pole that was about a 100 yards away and zoomed and I was able to take a picture.  There was a quality difference as expected from shooting 100 yards versus 30 yards.  But at 30-50 yards, the amount of detail that was seen was impressive.TEST: Burst rateI was able to take two pictures (RAW MODE) quickly before the camera needed to process for a few seconds and I was able to take two more pictures and repeating the same process.TEST: Auto-ShutoffLeave it on and with no use after 2 minutes, the camera shuts off. You can set the time in the settings.TEST: Video - Video recorded perfectly and clear.  It shoots at 1080p HD and you can freeze fast moving action up to 320fps.TEST: ISO Low-light/No FlashAs one expects on high ISO, you are going to get noise but I used it in a really dark setting and had it to the highest ISO and sure enough, I was able to take a picture with no flash.  A lot of noise, but it worked.TEST: WI-FIThe first thing I had to do was download the FUJIFILM Photo Receiver app and make sure it detects the F800EXR.  For iPad or iPhone users, you need to go to settings for your Wi-Fi, you will see the Fuji Camera listed in the network.  Select that then go to your app.  Select the image you want to transfer on your camera and send the image and hit connect on the app.  And that is it...the photo transmits wirelessly to your smartphone or tablet.TEST: MACROI did take a few pictures of flowers, no insects (as I'm used to sticking my DSLR/lens very close) but for the most part, closeup of flowers and objects close up, worked well using the MACRO function.  I figured with the 25mm capability, it would work well.TEST: SOFTWAREAs mentioned, at this time, since the camera is too new, there is no Adobe software support for this camera's RAW .RAF files.  But I'm sure there will be support, hopefully soon.  But you do get FUJIFILM's software and SilkyPix Raw Converter which allows you to modify the .RAF file but export only as JPG.  I know with older FinePix cameras, .RAF files were opened in earlier versions of Adobe software but the .RAF file for the F800EXR is different and won't open via Adobe Software as of Sept. 2012.  JPG's work perfectly on any software including Adobe software, so no problem.*****UPDATE - 10/3/2012******Adobe has released Lightroom 4.2 and Adobe Raw and DNG Converter 7.2 which now works with the the F800EXRJUDGMENT CALL:I'm impressed.  I'm a DSLR user but this point-and-shoot maybe be small but it's definitely a powerhouse!  I am amazed of how many functions this digital camera has and the fact you can transfer images to your smart phone and tablet with ease is quite impressive.  But most impressive is how awesome the pictures did turnout with light, utilizing the flash but most impressively, from far away.  The amount of detail that was captured from such a long distance.  I was impressed because even shooting animals or birds with my DSLR and spotting scope, and I was amazed of how far I was able to take pictures with good amount of clarity and detail from far distances.The camera does amazingly well with light and it does have functions to shoot in low-light but as one would expect, you're going to have noise.But there are features that allows for the doubling of pixels.But if you want great macro or better clarity via long distance, then you'll want to upgrade to a DSLR and better glass.But this camera is one of the better point-and-shoots out there. It may be a little pricy for some, but with the wireless transmission and the quality of the pictures and video with all the extra features included, it's an impressive camera for its price range.If you do purchase this camera, just remember that you will want to buy a case to put your camera in, possibly a screen protector for its LCD screen.Overall, this is one of the better compact long zoom cameras that I have used.  The features are impressive and suffice to say, it's a camera that not only are you given your money's worth, you're getting a lot more for your buck in features.5 STARS!!!

I will post pictures here and on my Facebook page!! **As stated in other reviews this is a wonderful little camera.I have a Canon Rebel which I use 90% of the time I also have Sony cameras.But this little gem is by far my most \"fun\" camera!I love the filters.. there are so many funky things you can do WITHOUT software that makes this a hard camera NOT to pick up and play with. For example you can pick a color.. lets say red and take a picture.. the entire picture BUT anything red will be in greywash, with the colors \"popping\" .. it is really cool. There are also filters for a \"comic book\" look sketched look and much more.I took this camera to Vermont and just went crazy snapping pictures.. the zoom is simple and effective, not too grainy even at max zoom. The battery life is excellent, the ease of use is extremely easy also. (As stated in other reviews I could not get the GPS locator to work either, as stated I think you need to use it with a phone? not too sure.. will double check it and update this review. I have a Sony Camcorder and it has the GPS built in, so I till see what's up with this)Anyway.. on first looks/use I really REALLY like this camera.. if you don't like to take pics.. then take them to photoshop and play with them, but still want neat effects.. you REALLY should check this out!I will post pictures showing the effects here and on my facebook page, and also update this review.. I just wanted to toss my 2 cents info their own use, or as a gift for Christmas.. I would give it a shot!Jim", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Happy With Camera", "Author": "Carter (1amazonreviewer@gmail . com) \"Carter\"", "ReviewID": "R29PVWFW0HA3M5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update: April 11, 2013, thought I would check back in and let you know that the camera is still going strong and we are more pleased with the camera than ever, great shots, we use it for sporting events all the time.This is a great point and shoot with some really robust features. You can tell that this one was thought through, and that the finished product (quality pictures) was always the goal in each of the features.The size of the sensor is huge. Not as big as the dslr's but a leap forward for point and shoots and will produce some surprising images. Also you know that the megapixels on this is monstrous, for big big photos. That is not to say they everyone is looking to make 16 x 20 or bigger enlargements of their pics, but you can if needed which is awesome. the best thing about the huge pictures is that you can crop them and find a picture within a picture if your hand is steady.And that brings us to the image stabilization. Works as intended and thats not something you will find on many point and shoots.Panorama feature is a little difficult and wonky / hit and miss, but its there if thats what you  are into.All in all great and doesnt weigh a ton for what it does. As always if you have any questions just ask me.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Picture Perfect", "Author": "nitsa", "ReviewID": "R32XBISUUT89HL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second Fuji camera and I am thrilled to say that it does not disappoint. The more I play with this camera, the more I like it. It's extremely feature rich, with lots of shooting modes and options that should more than satisfy the casual shooter who likes to carry a camera with them.The amount of features this little camera contains is phenomenal. EXR-Auto mode means it allows me to just point and shoot and  can decide exactly what mode and camera settings your photo will need. The camera was even to able to know the difference for the various pictures I needed to take.The camera is capable of taking RAW images, or even RAW and JPEG together so you have a RAW image for later editing and a JPEG image for easy sharing.The  quality is superb, and the optical and intelligent digital zoom is also amazing.The  camera can take Full HD video, and also 'High-Speed' video (up to 320 frames per second) that when played at normal speed slows the action right down - this can be useful both in sport videos and nature videos. One thing you need to make sure of when shooting High Speed videos is to make sure you have a lot of good lighting, as in usual situations the video becomes very dark due to the shutter speed.The camera itself is so easy to use, and the size is small enough to fit into your pocket. It has a nice weight, i.e. doesn't feel cheap and plastic-like. The body is rubberized for easier handling and no fear of dropping it, and there are places dedicated for your fingers and thumb for easy one-handed use.A battery, wrist strap, USB cable, AV cable, software disc, wall adapter and battery charger all come in the box. The battery had a small amount of charge right from the box, then when it had worn down completely it took about 3-4 hours to charge fully again.", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice camera, but the wifi options needs work", "Author": "KindlePad", "ReviewID": "RBCNMIWPAMJU8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera. I let my daughter take it on a class trip and it survived easily and she came back with tons of pics and videos. The angle of the lens is wide enough to give you a great shot and the picture quality was more than acceptable.2 cons only:1. The wifi option is really really complicated to use. I had to give up on it. No prob as I just put the memory cards in my laptop.2. The flash has to be manually opened via a button. Most POS cam's have some sort of auto release for the flash.Otherwise a very good pocket sized camera that shoots very good pics.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Packs a compact punch", "Author": "Damian P.

It's extremely feature rich, with lots of shooting modes and options that should more than satisfy the casual shooter who likes to carry a camera with them.So, here's with I like:1.  The zoom.  The zoom is much better than I expected, and shooting in EXR mode, it does a great job in keeping the image steady, which isn't easy to do.2.  The 360\u00b0 Pano:  It took a bit of practice for me to get this down, but once I did, no problem.  I like panos, so this is a fun feature to have.3.  Video:  The camera does a great job with short videos.  Not much more to say, just a nice feature.4.  Big display screen. My eyes are getting old, and having a nice big screen is awesome.5.  Advanced Mode.  This is where all the fun stuff is, and by that I mean all the creative filters that make shooting fun.  All done by the camera, so really no need to spend hours playing with images in Photoshop (though nothing's stopping you from doing that) for a quick one or two off with effects.6.  Camera Build.  Solid.  Enough said there.7.  Photos.  Good quality images.So, why not five stars?1.  The wifi execution could be better.  At first I just couldn't get the connection between my camera and phone to work.  It took me a while to figure out what I was doing wrong, but once I did, this feature seems to work consistently, and is nice if you want to upload a few pics while out and about.2.  Geotagging.  You have to use the GPS in the phone to geotag images.  I'd rather the camera have it's own GPS chip and it do this, but I guess you can't have it all.All in all, this is a nice camera and a great value.", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Fast", "Author": "phillip", "ReviewID": "R2SDRFP9FQE3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great purchase.

It has got to be one of the greatest little cameras I have tried.I love it's wireless transfer aspect,which I use to send pictures to be worked on to my ipad.It also can be used with android and smart phones.The photo transfers were my pleasant surprise when I first started using this little gem.A couple apps and you are on your way to sending pictures from the camera to your mobile device or pad.The camera is very compact and feels good in my hand. The 3 inch lens display reads well and I can even see it in areas that  are not not in significant shade. This camera has more features than one needs,but gives great filter choices etc.It has:EXR HR (High Resolution) priority mode - the sensor utilizes all of its 16 megapixels for the superior results.It has motion sensors that even in low light prevent blurring. Some of it's great features are:The FinePix F800EXR, with Wireless Image Transfer, features a significantly powerful  1/2\" 16 MegaPixel EXR-CMOS sensor that delivers vivid and outstanding image quality and performance - particularly in low light.  The F800EXR also uses the bright and fast FUJINON 20x Wide-Angle long-zoom lens (25-500mm) that makes for exceptional images, along with the Intelligent Digital Zoom feature that actively doubles zoom distance and an super-clear 3.0\" high contrast 460K resolution LCD.The EXR DR (Dynamic Range) priority mode - takes two pictures and combines them to provide a wide dynamic range of up to 1600%.EXR SN (Signal to Noise) priority mode - pixels are doubled up to increase sensitivity and give better results in low light conditions.My low-light pictures look less grainy for this feature.As I said a great camera- for a man or woman on the move!
