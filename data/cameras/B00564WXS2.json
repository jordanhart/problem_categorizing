It has a very clear picture both day and night .In my case it isn't completely dark becouse of the street light about 200 ft away but I can see almost as well at night as I can during the day.This camera is well worth the price .I gave it 4 stars becouse I dont think that a camera at this price point deserves five stars.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00564WXS2"}}
