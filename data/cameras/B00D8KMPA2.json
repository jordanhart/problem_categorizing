There is some tunneling on the P7000 due to the length of the tube that allows it to take the lens, but the photo quality is worth the slightly smaller area. The wide angle shots are lovely and the sharpness using the telephoto is better than I've ever gotten out of my camera without it. Then again, I'm studying the camera functions so it might just be that my skills are getting better, but it sure seems like the lens really helps you get close without getting in your subject's face.I'd give it 5 stars, but I really don't know enough about photography yet to comfortably give that strong an endorsement. That's said, I'd heartily recommenced this for other amateur photo enthusiasts.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D8KMPA2"}}
