I purchased this item and just strapped it to the camera with a cable tie with no problem. The hookup was no problem (5 min) and you just don't use the audio cable from the camera.The problem is noise... The amp is very sensitive and had an automatic level adjusting control. At first it was great and I heard things I never did before using the original camera mic THEN the neighbors outdoor air conditioner kicked on. I hear the air conditioner kicking on all the time with the original camera mic BUT with this this unit it just shut down and NOTHING was heard, not even the air conditioner.  I brought it inside and tried it with same camera power source and it worked great, very sensitive.  There is no way to control or set the 'auto level' and it shuts down when it shouldn't. It will 'probably work for Winter (when it's quiet) and in the mean time I may try inserting it into a tube and make a quasi-shotgun mic or some sound deadening material.Overall, good idea, simple setup, uses camera power, but may have problems in noisy environments.UPDATE: It's nowcCool enough air conditioner is not needed so I tried the amp again and slid it next to the camera. Wow, Without the noisy air conditiong (3 feet away) this thing is GREAT. I hear a lot more than with the mic on the camera.Quite happy...", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "please read \"PREAMPED\" AMPLIFIED", "Author": "I.

Got the mike, came with no instructions, but easy to hook up.The problem is (potential problem) there is a lot of noise, like some sort of interference. So loud that you can't monitor this for extended periods of time, almost unusable.I contacted Amazon in an effort to try to get the information for the seller or the manufacturer of this mic, but that was a challenge in it;s self dealing with so called costumer service Amazon has lately.Anyhow, I managed to get the info on my own about the seller, sent them several emails with sample file of what the mic sounds like, but no answer. See video.Obviously they have no clue or don't want to deal with this.So is this a good mic, probably not, unless you like a lot of white noise with your audio!!Basically if you get this and you have problems, don't expect any help, either from Amazon or the actual seller.UPDATE July 25 2012.Now nothjing is heard, it died.
