{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great optics, bad implementation", "Author": "maxGamer", "ReviewID": "R3P04W43JFHBWI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to add to my existing swann setup. It has a much better nightime picture than the Maxi Day Night from Swann and it's housing and base are chunky and imposing, but the company seemed to go out of their way to make connection to existing systems annoyingly difficult.Pros:Great night picture. Day picture is just like any 100.00 camera.Chunky, thick metal housing and mounting base. Very reassuring against vandalism.Great field of view (FOV). It sees a lot wider than the Swann and farther thanks to the extra LEDs.Cons:Metal mounting screws are aluminum, forget about them if you drop them in tall grass. Magnets won't pick them up worth a flip.Power hungry - Forget plugging this into the wall far (150') from the camera. It'll go dead as soon as the night LEDs come on.Proprietary connections. Yes, that's right. This idiot thing doesn't even hook up to BNC connectors unless you use a 100' long adapter cable (supplied). This means if you have an existing system you need to run all new cable for the first 100' or you have a large bundle of cable hanging right beside the camera.All in all it's a great little camera, and it should be for 250 bux, but the little goofups really hurt it's usability. If I had to do it again I'd just get another Swann Day/Night Maxi.UPDATE 12/15/2013: We've been running this camera in an eave location for five full years now, nonstop. It has been a decent camera overall. It does need to be re-set by unplugging the power every few months but the picture has been better than the Swann here B000BVZRZQBut the last month has been really spotty. When the night LEDs come on it flakes out and cuts the picture until it's unplugged and plugged back in. Being that my Swann is still running like the day I plugged it in I have to lower the rating on this one due to it's crazy high cost and crappy longevity.", "Date": "October 17, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000OQ8BWY"}}
