MY other Sanyo took ok pictures compared to this. The pictures are great, the software is easy to get working. I added a cute little frame to one of my pictures and I am done shopping for cameras for hopefully at least a couple years! I use it with a memory card-the big one and it runs on a battery pack that is easy to recharge. In fact, you don't even take the battery out of the camera to recharge it. Wish I bought this camera from the beginning but at least I learned that there are vast differences in cameras.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "sanyo vcp digital camera", "Author": "joyce hughes", "ReviewID": "R24QLL8F8DEO9S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "bought this for my daughter, she loved the color, the quality and features, very pleased.

Though I was embarrassed when after only one use the battery refused to hold a charge. Since then we've had to replace the battery and we are waiting for the new battery to fully charge before we can see if the camera will work. I wouldn't say all in all it is a bad purchase, but its frustrating when you buy something new and it doesn't work.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Diva Gives it 5 Stars", "Author": "Tashdiva", "ReviewID": "R1ESFK0N18P86H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second camera via the Sanyo brand and I highly recommend this camera because it takes amazing shots and has awesome settings and camera features. The touch screen is an added plus and makes the camera seem very chic. Hopefully this camera last me a good along while but if not I will be buying another Sanyo camera for sure. The quality is way better than my Kodak easy share camera which I have and never use. I'm very photogenic and particular about picture quality so trust me on this you can't go wrong here. lol.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "sanyo vpc-e1500tp", "Author": "volleyballr", "ReviewID": "R1C41OMF1E4QC9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera as an early Christmas present and I really like it! It has tons of features I have yet to figure out, and has good resolution. Since it is a touch screen it does take some getting used to, as you have to push the right button or it will do something else.A good battery life is important because I'm always turning it on and off and it doesn't seem to drain the battery when using it for a while.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "I really wish I hadn't bought this...", "Author": "Shannon Lovett", "ReviewID": "RPCPHZRNLZLT4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I hate this camera for one reason. No matter what setting I put it on the flash ALWAYS fires twice! Normally, I suppose that would be fine. But with a 14 month old, by the time the picture gets taken with the second flash, his eyes are closed. I miss out on a lot of great pictures because of this. My old camera (Kodak Easy Share) had a flash setting where it would fire once and that was great! I got great pictures out of that for years, until the screen finally went out. Luckily I bought my Sanyo from a pawn shop and only paid 40 dollars for it. Not worth even that. My old camera went out right before my sons first birthday and I had to get something quick. But I will be getting a new camera as soon as I can and do some research to make sure I can have a flash that won't blind my son. Even the orange flash charging light will make him close his eyes. Other than that, the camera takes fairly clear pictures as long as the flash is on (or you're outside). I can clearly see my sons eyes are closed, that is.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "Penelope Miles", "ReviewID": "R1VQPI4SNZF8RJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for my daughter for Christmas.
