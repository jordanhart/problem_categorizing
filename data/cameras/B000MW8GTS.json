{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great lens, image quality all in a compact sized camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3VK40G8P57EBY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've always been a fan of Panasonic's Optical Image Stabilizers on their Lumix line of cameras. The DMC-FX12 was quite the steal at under $200.  Very compact camera without sacrificing image quality (at least not too much). There have been testimonies stating that the images produced from the DMC-FX12 are soft, but you can fix that by changing the color mode to \"vivid\" and presto, sharper images. The only gripe I have with this compact performer is that anything from ISO 800 and higher provides very noisy images. Most of the low light shots I've taken (minus the flash with color mode set to 'natural') were acceptable, but quite noisy.  This camera has a quality Leica lens which helps contribute to some crisp images. Other than that, the flash is decent and under normal lighting conditions, you get some pretty darn good images (the image stabilizer makes a huge difference). This is a point-and-shoot camera and people tend to expect SLR quality images from a point-and-shoot camera. I have yet to come across a p&s; shooter that comes anywhere close to SLR quality. As for the DMC-FX12, it's compact, great for point-and-shoot casual shooting, and worth every penny. I was in debate of whether to get this shooter or the DMC-FX30 but I wasn't about to shell out another extra $100 for a difference of 7mm of focal length between the 2 shooters. I chose the DMC-FX12 due to price and the image quality.", "Date": "May 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent pocket camera (Review updated 7/29/07)", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2G3C8PT31E5PA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Light carry weight and small size were near the top of my \"must have\" features for a new camera; I wanted something that I would grab every day, put in a pocket, and not worry about.  I have a digital SLR but carrying around every day is a bit much.After looking at Canon and Nikon pocket cameras I decided on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX12.  (I did on-line research, then went to my local camera store where I've been buying gear for 30 years.  Their recommendations are generally spot-on.  BTW - I paid a few bucks more at the camera store; buying on Amazon would have been less expensive.  But since I spent some time in the store with the clerk, I felt it not right to use his expertise and then purchase elsewhere).The FX12 is quite small - easily fits in a dress shirt pocket or front slacks pocket.  (Jean pockets maybe not so much, they tend to be tighter and might damage the camera).  The camera is also quite light, although perhaps a bit heavier than it looks.The Leica lens was a major selling point for me.  Leica glass reputation is second-to-none.  However, the focal length could be just a tad longer for my taste.  This camera is great for wide angle shots (group photos, etc.) but grabbing a telephoto shot means going to electronically enhanced zoom and, even with a Leica lens, that has inherit limitations.Close up shots (such as flowers) come out very nicely indeed, even for such a photographer as myself.Construction of the camera seems...delicate.  Flimsy is too strong a term, but \"delicate\" seems to fit.  Of course the controls are small by design, which is great, but the battery/card cover isn't all that substantial.  However the camera seems to ride happily in whichever pocket I have dropped it into, and the construction is not such that would make one concerned that the machine will be crunched in the carrying.  Perhaps because it is so small...it just seems delicate to me.The battery, as far as I can determine (someone PLEASE tell me if I got this wrong!) can't be charged in the camera.  Battery life seems good - I've not run it down yet.  However I would rarely, if ever, use the camera extensively at one go.  If I know I'm going out for a shoot I'd take a DSLR.  So you might look to others for recommendations on battery life.  More important to me is how long the battery will keep a charge while the camera is in my pocket.  I don't want to pull out the camera to find it's gone dead sitting.  After being toted around for a week, taking the odd (in every sense of the word <g>) photo, playing with the lens and camera settings, the battery was still showing a complete charge.I can't comment on the software that came with the camera, as I use Photoshop Elements.  However I've used card readers in XP and Vista computers without a problem in retrieving images.I've not noticed that the images are particulary soft, but it may be a result of the images I've taken.  More experience may tell a different tale.Quality-wise I've had no issues with the images.  Composition errors are not the fault of the camera ;-)The image stabilazition does seem to have a positive influence on low light shots.  The flash is, as one would expect from a small pocket camera, limited in range.There is no viewing port on the FX12, just the viewing glass on the back of the camera.  After spending a lifetime of looking through ports (both rangefinder and SLR) I'm having some difficulty in holding the camera to get my shot - I think one loses something in support when one has to hold the camera away from one's body when shooting.  It appears that many manufacturers are taking this design road.  On the bright side it does cut down on the profile size of the machine.I can't comment on the noise factor at higher ASA values; I've not had cause to make those types of shots yet.  The bottom line is, of course, always the image and I've been quite satisfied with the quality of the images I've made with this machine.  However, I've not made any 8x10 (or larger) prints yet, and there may be hidden faults that will appear only on larger prints.Since I truly drop this thing daily into my shirt or pants pocket I had some concerns about scratching the viewing glass.  I found a Delkin \"eFilm\" shade which adds nearly no weight to the camera (it does add about 1/4 of an inch to the depth of the camera)and protects the viewing glass and also gives protection from direct sunlight when used outdoors.  It's removable, but I've found it doesn't interfere with keeping the camera \"pocketable\".Other than a bit more lens reach the only other thing on my \"WIBCI\" list (Wouldn't It Be Cool If) would be manual settings.  However it's a point and shoot with autmatic controls (although there are a number of scenes from which to choose!) so one can't gripe about lack of manual controls.Start up time is quite fast for this type of camera - much faster than my Kodak 443.  Shutter lag isn't bad (although taking action shots at football games might be a bit dicey.  Try golf <g>).  Delay between shots is noticeable, but I have a slow Kodak card in the bay and a faster card might improve write speed.For a $200 camera it's quite acceptable, and it allows me to make pictures where other cameras don't - because you can't make a photo with a camera you don't have in hand; this FX12 has become a fixture with me.ADDENDUM 7/29/07Battery life while carrying has proven not to be a problem - after a couple of weeks in my pocket, taking an occasional shot the battery still has plenty of power.However - I did try a few shots of a fast moving subject and found that the shutter lag does have a significant impact.  Not as bad as my old Kodak 443, but it does require a considerable amount of anticipation on pulling the trigger to get the shot.  Also, on some portrait shots, @ 10 feet in subdued light the photos came out underexposed (the camera was set on \"portrait\" in modes).  I was able to correct the issue in PhotoShop, but there was considerable noise.  I believe the flash was at the absolute limit at 10 feet.Overall, after a few more weeks with the system, I still like the camera very much - even though some shots have given me trouble.  The only reason I had trouble was because I had the camera with me <g>. I'm slipping the camera into my pocket on a daily basis - but need more time to get used to the limitations of a point 'n shoot.", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "A great little camera", "Author": "Mark Twain", "ReviewID": "R1Q8T6UUSMJ050", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This a nifty little camera.  I already have a 35mm SLR, but wanted a compact digital camera that I would be more inclined to carry and use and without the worries of film.  I do carry and use this camera much more that I would with a larger film camera, so for that it is great.  However, I find myself missing some of the features that I'm used to, especially manual settings and manual focus.  I wish that it would focus and cycle through shots much quicker.  Also, the lens is tiny, but as the whole camera is tiny, that is the nature of the product.  I find this camera fairly easy to use.  I was able to starting taking picture right out of the box and before looking at the manual.  However, some of the menus and controls are somewhat anti-intuitive.  The basic use is straight forward, but trial and error or reading the manual is needed to take full advantage of all this camera offers.  The manual included reads like a manual; it is so choked full of warning and disclaimers that finding the useful information is tedious.  Also included is a disk of photo software,  for both Microsoft and Mac OS.  However, I use Linux, so this is utterly useless to me.  No mention is ever made to other OS besides those two.  Despite this, I've had no problems connecting the camera to my computer with the supplied USB cable; It mounts like a FAT16 flashdrive, and I assume it could be used as one too.  This camera is loaded with a number of settings and features; this somewhat make-up for the lack of control offered by other cameras.  One foolish feature is when the camera is on, the lens extends itself from the body and is uncovered and exposed, and it stays this way even if the camera is in a mode that does not use the lens such as while connecting to a computer or playback.  I bought this camera with traveling in mind, so hope it will be durable and it seem like it will be, but I can't yet truly comment on that.  Overall, I really enjoy this little camera, and its size allows me to keep it handy.  As a point-and-shoot camera, it is great.  For a wider range of photography, reading the manual and learning about all the features is necessary.", "Date": "April 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent city camera", "Author": "Lee A.

Even when I lock the ISO at 100, there're still a lot of noise in the photos. After I turned on the lights in my room (at night), turned off the image stablizer, and hold the camera steady (which I'm very good at), the photos still turned out softer and noisier than my SD10! (Yes, like one of the reviewers said, if your change the color setting to Vivid, the photo will become shaper, but the colors would look exagerrated).* Most of the time when I point the camera towards an object with sunlight in the background, I would see some purple streaks on the LCD screen. (Although those streaks disappeared once I zoomed-in during playback, display it on the computer monitor, or print it out).* Despite having a much larger LCD screen than my SD10 (only 1.5\"), this Panasonic's screen quality is not as sharp. In fact it's not sharp at all; the photos I took always look blurry/soft on its LCD screen, I had to either zoom in or display them on my computer monitor in order to see how sharp the photos actually are! For the first time I realize how misleading the resolution figure on a LCD screen can be.* Whether I use the built-in memory or my Kingston 4GB Class-6 SD card, it's slower to \"write\" the pictures into the memory after they're captured, and this is when I'm not using flash! Again, I'm comparing it to my old SD10 camera with 32MB SD card.Conclusion:I was really thrilled when I first received this camera after only 2 days of ordering it from Amazon.com (I chose the Standard shipping). After an hour of playing with various features and reading the manual, I've learned all the features on this camera. Unfortunately in the following 48 hours, I was disappointed numerous times and decided to mail it back to Amazon. It's a painful experience because I really want to like and keep this camera (due to it's price, size, style, finish, etc). Now I think I would choose a compact camera with a larger CCD size (e.g. 1/1.8\") even if it doesn't have an optical image stabilizer.", "Date": "November 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best camera there is", "Author": "Hector D.
