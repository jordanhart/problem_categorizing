So they have to be able to be treated a little rough. This one is great,  little rain won't hurt it. The lens doesn't expand out the front like others. This is important because when those camera get banged a little, then the lens is stuck in or out, the camera is trash. No issues with this camera. The GPS is a bonus as we can plot where we took the photo on a map.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006Q8UUKA"}}
