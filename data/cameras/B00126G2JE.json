In fact I like it better than my digital SLR for the most part.  I purchased this because I am a mom and I like to take pictures of my kids when we are out.  It really isn't practical to haul an SLR to the park, Disney, etc.  So I did a lot of research and went with this one.  I love that you can watch the pictures in HD on your TV. It takes good video for a camera (not really an issue for me because I have a video camera.  I am very impressed with the overall picture quality.  Also the camera has tons of modes to take pictures in and my favorite feature of the camera is that you can crop the picture right there on the camera.  Finally, I love that these cameras come in colors it helps make the camera standout so you don't forget it or get it confused at parties.  Anyway I am very impressed so far.  I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't had it that long.", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Ok but not the best", "Author": "PinsandNeedles", "ReviewID": "R1YNYQYAMTTRJM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera and returned it the next day.  My dad had bought a Casio Exilim z80 so i tested both side by side.  First, the casio is smaller and lighter than the kodak which makes it feel better in your hands.  As for picture quality, they both were fairly similar, however I would have to say the casio was a tad bit better.  When the pictures were enlarged, the casio's images were less pixalated looking.  The kodak's video recording was what really shocked me.  I took the same video with both cameras.  The casio's video was amazingly clear.  The kodak on the other hand was horribly grainy looking.  I also had a ceiling fan running during both videos.  in the kodak video you could hear loud air blowing sounds but the casio didnt have that.  another cool thing about the casio is that you can take a picture while recording a video.  Both cost about the same and are both 8 MP.  in my opinion, check out the casio exilim z80 before the kodak m863.  hope this helps :)", "Date": "June 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "M.

Otherwise this is a really nice camera.Pros:- Easy to use menus- Feels very solid in your hand. Well made.- Focuses quickly and takes pictures quickly- Takes great 5 megapixel photos!- Screen is large and clear- Includes the kodak easy share software- Cool color!- Fits nicely in your pocket or purse. Perfect for vacations.- Video recording works quite well.- When taking vertical shots the screen automatically adjust the image so that it is not horizontal. This is a VERY nice feature! Not sure what that feature is called but it's cool. :) Pictures stay right side up when you copy them to PC as well.Cons:- 'Right arrow' key on the navigation pad stopped working at 3 months.- 'Left arrow' key on the navigation pad is really hard to press because of screen size.- You absolutely cannot see the screen during bright sunlight.- Doesn't do so well on night pictures. Has trouble focusing and takes very grainy pictures. I was so unhappy with my Vegas pictures!- Pictures are a bit grainy at 8.2 megapixel but it of course doesn't affect your prints. Who actually views pics at 8.2 anyway?- Viewing screen scratches easily.

I purchased it in late 2008 and have used it a few times. I've been careful to keep the battery charged. It recently began to malfunction and cannot be repaired. The camera turns on for a second, but then immediately powers off again. Switching to a new battery does not help; nor does removing the memory card or attempting to operate the camera on AC power.

Unless your kids are perfectly trained not to move an inch when they see a camera & your house is professionally lit, I can't see how you would be satisfied with this camera. I took pictures in every different scenario imaginable and used all the different settings. The outside pictures of landscape turned out beautiful! Every other picture was grainy and/or blurry. If your into scenic photography this camera can't be beat for the price, but your planning on taking pictures of live people or animals look elsewhere. I even called Kodak and was told they have had ALOT of complaints about grainy/blurry pictures with this camera. They're advice was to try a couple of different settings for taking pictures of the kids & to \"make sure you hold the camera perfectly still to avoid blurry pictures\". Anyone else out there able to get a 2 year old to sit still & hold a pose while you try not to move a muscle & still get a decent picture? I've decided this is not the camera for me, so I'm sending it back. I've had a 5MP Kodak camera for the past 3 1/2 years and have had no problems until recently. I just don't think they make things like they used to even 3 short years ago. This is the second camera I've purchased to replace the old one, it's also the second disappointment. I'm not an expert photographer by any means, but to me, point & shoot means POINT & SHOOT. It doesn't mean point, change every setting imaginable, turn on 12 more lights, strap your kids in a highchair to make them sit still, then freeze yourself (except one finger to push the button), and then shoot.

There are so many settings and I have not figured them all out just yet, but I am sure once I do then I will like it even more.  I have enjoyed taking pictures and videos and using the software that came with it to enhance the pictures.  The camera is small enough to take along but not too small to hold and steady. I bought a 2GB SD card and have 1272 pictures and 44 minutes of video at the highest quality setting.  So far I have recorded a school play, two award ceremonies and taken many photos from near and far in all light conditions.

Howell", "ReviewID": "R2EUVRGFONQZQN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a camera for the last few months for a upcoming trip, and managed to find this one for cheap. Most 8MP cameras usually go for about $100+ bucks, so paying nearly half that was a steal.The camera itself is very lightweight and small, about the size of a credit card and about the same size as a man's wallet. I'm not a expert photographer, so my main goal for this camera was to get decent pictures and video for a low price.The camera itself does a decent job of taking pictures with decent amount of sunlight, although it does start to have issues when going into darker areas. The good thing is there are multiple modes to reduce blur and take pictures in different climates (Snow, Beach, etc). The interface is easy to use, and does not require much thought on the user. You can also adjust the picture quality so you can take more pictures, although any mode below 6MP looks pretty bad.Storage is very limited on the camera, so you can only take a few shots before the internal memory is full (about 10MB, which is barely enough for 10 8MP shots, and 40 1MP shots). SD cards are a must, with the 1GB SD card being able to store about 870 8MP shots.The video quality is decent for a camera this cheap. You can either do 320 x 240 mode with 30FPS or 640 x 480 with 15FPS. Either way, the video is usually pretty decent and is at least youtube quality. On a 1GB SD card, you can store about 20 minutes in 640 x 480 mode, and 30 minutes  in 320 x 240 mode. If you are looking to do a lot of video, a 8GB card might be recommended.The downside of the camera is the build quality. The mode wheel at the top feels a bit cheap and hard to move, and the SD and battery card cover makes me feel like it will break at any moment. The USB type it uses is exclusive to Kodak cameras, so buying used might be a problem if you do not get the cable. The battery is a rechargable one, but it does not support any other battery types so you cannot just put new ones in on the fly.Overall, the camera was very decent for the $56 I paid for it used. You can download the PDF and drivers from Kodak's site if you are buying used, but make sure you at least get the USB cable or charger.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed with this camera", "Author": "L.

If I took pics of my kids they were ALWAYS blurry. I even had the camera serviced 3 times in the first year I had it and it still froze on me.But the MD863 took FANTASTIC shots! And I was impressed with the shutterspeed.Only one major problem. The camera made a very high pitched noise when the LCD screen was on. When I recorded video the noise was amplified. The high pitched noise would stop when the LCD screen went off to conserve battery power. Called Kodak and they said I could send it in for repair but with my unsuccessful repair history with the other camera I am going to choose to return it to Walmart instead. I don't want to have to wait weeks for it to get fixed for one, and 2 I don't have a lot of faith that they will actually fix the dang thing. Kodak should just give you a new one when these things happen.If I cannot get another one (same model) that works, I think this will kill it for me and Kodak.

Since this is my first digital camera, the most important factors for me were ease-of-use and overall user-friendliness. On both those counts, I can say the unit performs remarkably well.  My wife, who is very much a non-techie, has had no trouble using the camera for taking pictures of her eBay merchandise.  Clarity and resolution are very good. And the camera interfaces fairly seamlessly with the included Kodak software and Kodak Gallery.  Battery life also seems remarkably good. It would have been nice, though, if Kodak had included even a simple cloth carrying case.  The only reason I didn't give the camera five stars was because of the difficulty viewing subject matter outdoors with the LCD viewfinder, especially in bright sunlight.  The glare makes it almost impossible to see your subject.  In fairness, though, this seems to be a problem with LCD viewfinders in general, not just Kodak's.

Unlike other digital cameras that tend to flash for five seconds before taking the picture I can go ahead and click away and capture the moment, whatever it may be.  The screen is hard to see in darker places like bars or dimly lit restoraunts but is usually able to be viewed after pic is taken thanks to the awesome flash. It has a pretty god face recognizer on it but I honestly don't have a reference of comparison.  It also has quite a bit of options for picture taking including a two-to-three shot panoramic mode.  I wish it came with a case but that's about the only real complaint I have.  I keep it on 5 mega pixels for the pictures and they come out looking amazing and it allows around 2000 pics on a 2GB SD memmory  card.The zoom feature is nice but when it gets into the digital zoom arena it gets pretty choppy.  Not much of a complaint their though as the normal zoom goes in pretty deep.All in all if you want a camera to take out and just take fun pics with you can't really go wrong with this one.
