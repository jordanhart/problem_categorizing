{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Lens better up close; blurrier farther away", "Author": "A. Johnston", "ReviewID": "R3HVXFND33IZRY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Be aware when purchasing that there are some aspects to the new \"improved\" lens that may not be for everyone.  This week it has been fairly well documented (and confirmed by GoPro) that while the new lens produces much sharper images under 4', they are blurrier at distances greater than 4'.  It does NOT focus at infinity.  For reasons not fully explained, they moved the focal point of the lens in close and sacrificed distance clarity.Update at bottom.You will get great shots under 4' and soft focus beyond that.  Depending on what you want it for, this camera may not be for you and the regular H3 might be a better bet.  Since this is an effect of the lens it applies to both stills and video.  On the other hand, it's still a decent small action camera, and if you take a lot of video in motion you may not notice this at all.  For YouTube uploads and streaming it may not matter, I haven't tested this myself. If you want better clarity in your images the 3B is a good choice. I personally will play with it this week before deciding if I should return it. (Update: it's going back.)It boggles the mind that they have produced a camera that claims to have a better lens and ignored the fact that it is in fact worse for 90% of what you'll be filming.  Great clarity on your handlebars but not so good on the scenery.Edit: other pluses- the color is much better with the 3+ than the 3.  Low light shooting is also better, although sometimes lens flare from lights is a little worse, sometimes better.  No more chromatic aberration (yellow/purple fringing).  Just do some reading before buying this, they made some trade-offs in the new lens.Updated 10/17:Well after comparing the two (3+B and 3B) this week, there are some more problems that have had me downgrade this to a 3 star.  For one, the right and left sides of the images on the 3+ are smeared.  I mean really distorted, and I'm not using SuperView.  Additionally the contrast seems to be set too high, causing some loss of detail in the shadows and blowing out whites a bit.  This at least is changeable with a firmware update if they choose to do so.  The blurry edges put me over the edge and I'm returning it.  It's too bad, it's almost a great camera, with some nice improvements, but the lens is a definite problem, and not necessarily an improvement... certainly not 33% sharper.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "GoPro Hero3+ Black vs GoPro Hero3 Black and brief mention of Sony HDR-AS30V", "Author": "M.

Quoting the GoPro website:\"Camera software update 2.0 has lots in store for your GoPro. HERO3+ Black Edition cameras will get new SuperView(tm) video modes, new Auto Low Light settings, advanced Protune(tm) controls and more. For HERO3+ Silver Edition cameras, update 2.0 increases the field of view on all photo and video modes for even more immersive, wide-angle footage. And with new wireless camera software updates via the GoPro App, updating your GoPro has never been easier.\"UPDATE - 12/9/2013 - I've just updated my video with additional video samples from the Hero3+ compared to the Hero3. I also stuck in a short video of the Sony HDR-AS30V for additional comparison.-----Just about a year ago I bought the GoPro Hero3 Black. It was frought with issues and I felt it had been rushed out the door without adequate testing. Fortunately, some 3 firmware updates later, the GoPro Hero3 Black has become a reliable sports cam for me.I was both happy and frustrated to learn that the GoPro Hero3+ Black was being introduced. With promises of improved battery life and sharper lens, I wished I had waited to buy the Hero3+ instead of the Hero3. But now that I\"ve also got the Hero3+ Black, I've learned that it's not that big of an upgrade really and I still use and thoroughly enjoy using the Hero3. In fact for some things the Hero3 Black is superior to the Hero3+ Black. But battery life is definitely better and some people will love the new \"super wide\" mode that really gives you a stronger fisheye effect.I have been using the Hero3+ a lot for time lapse phtography and for recording bike rides. I also travel with it and use it for capturing stunning wide-angle still shots. A recent Hot Air Balloon ride enabled me to use the GoPro to caputre some utterly amazing video and stills from 1000 feet above ground.As for the claimed increased sharpness... well that's a mixed bag. What they've actually done is slightly decreased the depth of field so that you now get increased sharpness for closer objects (like yourself) while the more distant background has become ever so slightly less sharp. I use mine more for photography where I want as sharp a focus as I can get for scenic shots but I have not noticed a very significant decrease in sharpness for distance. This is a non-issue for me. Some people complaining of significant loss of sharpness actually have a defective camera and this has been confirmed by GoPro.One huge improvement I've noticed is the significantly better color accuracy. There is a pronounced color shift of the Hero3 Black when compared to the Hero3+. The Hero3+ has a much more accurate, neutrual color bias which is more pleasing to me. The Hero3 had a more yellowish bias.The Hero3+ does much better in bright, snow (and probably sand) situations as can be seen in my video.The new \"super\" size setting gives a significantly wider field of view. As such you will notice a marked curvature of the image at the edges. This bending is most noticeable when an edge is present, You notice this much less if you're shooting at sky,,, skydiving, ski jumping etc. This is typical of a super wide angle, nearly fisheye, lens.\u25b6\ufe0e Battery LIfe:The Hero3+ comes with a marginally higher capacity battery (AHDBT-302.) It's rated at 1180mAh vs the prior battery which was rated 1050mAh. That's not much of an increase but it is an increase nonetheless. Apparently GoPro has also made some internal tweaks that results in a claimed 30% longer battery life. I generally get no more than slightly 1;15 of recording time with the Hero3 but I'm really happy to discover that the Hero3+ gives me a solid 2 hour recording time. So the battery life has most definitely been improved in the Hero3+.\u25b6\ufe0e Waterproof Housing:The housing has seen a significant change. It is much lighter in weight, less bulky and the 2-step latching mechanism has been completely redesigned. It is now just a single latch. It doesn't feel as sturdy to me as the previous latch and I'm not sure I like it or not yet. I'll have to use it a while to see how it holds up and how it works in the field under more extensive use. One good thing is that the Hero3 and Hero3+ will fit and operate in either housing... they are interchangeable. The Hero3+ housing is rated to 30M (131') underwater vs 60M (197') underwater for the Hero3 housing. The best thing about the new housing is the ease with which the buttons now work. In the previous housing pushing the buttons required quite a bit of force and they were very inconvenient to use. This has been improved significantly in the with the new housing. The buttons are a larger diameter and much easier to push.\u25b6\ufe0e Low Light setting:The Low Light setting does improve video in lower light situations but there is still visible grain. I have compared video from both my 3 and 3+ and the 3+ allows more definition and brings out a lot more detail in what was just darkness in the conditions when compared to the Hero3 when the lighting level is low. It is a definite improvement but it's still not excellent... just a lot better.\u25b6\ufe0e Firmware updates:GoPro has made the process of updating the firmware on the Hero3+ different. On the Hero3 all you needed to do was download the firmware to your computer, unzip it and move the files from the firmware update folder to the top level of a formatted MicroSD card. You then inserted the card into your GoPro and then turned the camera on... the firmware would be installed.The Hero3+ firmware update process has changed. When on the GoPro website you go through a web-based update process before you can download the firmware. You have to decide whether you want to update the WiFi and the camera firmware or just one or the other. Then you download the update and unzip it, you do not move just the files from the firmware update folder to the MicroSD card, but rather you move the entire firmware update folder to the MicroSD card which you then put into the GoPro Hero3+ and turn on the camera to initiate the firmware upgrade process.\u25b6\ufe0e Blurry backgrounds:GoPro has already acknowledged that a random number of cameras are exhibiting the exceedingly blurry background issue. My camera is perfect and has no such issue but others are having the problem and downgrading their review of the camera because of the issue. If you get a camera that has a really bad lack of sharpness, you may have gotten a defective camera and should either immediately exchange it or at least contact GoPro for further guidance.I like the Hero3+. It's more evolutionary of an update rather than revolutionary. If you are a current Hero3 Black owner, I wouldn't necessarily feel like you are stuck with a dinosaur. The Hero3 is still a very respectable camera in many ways. But there are some definite improvements in color balance and shooting options with the Hero 3+ and the new housing is easier to use but may not actually be as sturdy... that remains to be seen.I'd also like to mention that I recently got a Sony HDR-AS30V and the short story is that it's not nearly as good as the GoPro Hero3+ Black. It is much more basic in its availabe shooting modes. The Sony has downright lousy battery life. The waterproof enclosure is only good to 16' underwater and the display is pretty poor if you ask me. I find it difficult to read because Sony has chosen a some kind of a segmented font that looks like a 1970's Texas Instruments calculator. It's really really bad.I'll be updating my review as I use the Hero3+ more and more. But for now I can say that if you are feeling like you are \"stuck\" with your Hero3, just know that you've still got a great camera. The main improvements that are most significant for me with the Hero3+ are: improved battery life and somewhat better low light image capture.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best action camera you can get your hands on..*see update*", "Author": "Qazi", "ReviewID": "R3TJXH47DGSNFX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE 25/12/2013Finally I did a comparison of HERO3+ BE with HERO3 BE and the HERO+ BE lens is out of focus for objects that are far away but crisp for closeups. I use my GoPro cameras to record my motorsport activities so closeup sharpness is more important to me that is why I never noticed the out of focus background scenes. I do not use the GoPro cameras to capture images and instead  use a Canon 60D for photography. I have removed one star as my older HERO3 BE was sharp even for distant objects.(End of Update)---------------This review is about GoPro HERO3+ Black Edition which I have bought but there are some comments about other editions, casing and microSD card also which you may find useful for a comparison.When GoPro released HERO3, the whole internet was flooded with customers complaining about several issues which GoPro kept fixing with new firmware updates. I owned a HERO3 Black Edition and luckily encountered no issues as I always kept it up-to-date with the latest firmware. I also bought a recommended microSD card supporting full bitrate (more on this at the end of review).GoPro HERO3+ is exactly what the name says..an upgraded and more polished HERO3 but with a new lens and several new useful features, GoPro would have just changed the shape and easily called it HERO4.- Smaller and lighterThe waterproof case that comes with the package is now smaller and lighter but the actual camera is still the same size and weight. Smaller also means that unlike the previous waterproof case which supported maximum depth of 60m, the new smaller case now supports only 40m. Mounting base is same so it is still compatible with older accessories using the same mount. Smaller case is an improvement but what I found more interesting is that now the case buttons feel better and easier to use. The case locking mechanism has improved also which is another improvement.- 2x faster pocessorThis only applies to HERO+ Silver Edition as the processor in HERO3+ Black Edition is exactly the same as HERO3 Black Edition.- Improved lensThe new lens is one of the biggest improvements of the camera. Colors look sharper and you don't get a white washed look when shooting in low light conditions. GoPro claims 33% increase in image sharpness and and 2x reduction in imaging artifacts. If you look at two videos or pictures shot using HERO3+ BE and HERO3 BE then you can immediately tell without knowing which one is shot by the new lens. Yes, the difference is easily noticeable and the result nods to the GoPro claim of sharper image and less artifacts.- Auto Low Light modeThis is a feature which adjusts frame rate based on lightening conditions. The output is a brighter video which using the new lens saves more details and better quality videos without adding that white washed effect. In some low light conditions, the HERO3 BE completely missed some areas of the frame which were picked brighter by the HERO3 BE. I will be using this a lot while mounting it inside the car during midnight racing.- SuperViewAnother great feature for people who want to shoot wide angel shots or want more of themselves in the videos. I have read the technical details of how GoPro has achieved this and I had a feeling that the result would be distorted but to my surprise it turned out really good and covered a whole lot bigger area in good quality.- 30% longer battery lifeGoPro has achieved better battery life by adding a slightly bigger battery and tweaking the software for better battery management. The new battery is 1180mAH compared to older 1050mAh battery. If you have the old HERO3 batteries then they are still compatible with the new camera and thanks to the new battery management, the older batteries will give you more shooting time compared to the older HERO3 cameras. This is a huge improvement as battery life was significantly reduced from HERO2 to HERO3 cameras. Now you can record without the fear of battery dying in the middle of action.- 4x faster Wi-FiThe new Wi-Fi chip speeds up the Wi-Fi 4x for transferring and sharing media off the camera. It also speeds up controlling the camera from the remote or mobile app.After using the new features, I am extremely satisfied and do not regret upgrading from HERO3 BE to HERO3+ BE and would recommend the upgrade to others who want an improved experience and better video results. The new lens, better battery, new auto low light mode, superview and faster Wi-Fi are all features that end users would benefit regularly. If you have a HERO3 and shoot a lot of low light footage, miss out details or focus in direct sun light or want even more clear and detailed captures with sharper colors then HERO3+ BE won't disappoint you.I know a lot of people are unhappy that GoPro launched an upgrade sooner but considering how the industry is moving very fast with new technology coming up every few months, GoPro have to be on top of their game with new and improved cameras and HERO3+ Black Edition is the new name of the game. The HERO3 BE was the best action cam and now with the launch of the new camera, GoPro HERO3+ Black Edition has now taken the crown.Note on LCD/Battery bacpac, backdoors and casingsOlder LCD and battery bacpac are compatible with HERO3 but the backdoors are not compatible with the new case. If you have the older waterproof, skeleton or frame case then you can still use them with the HERO3+. Currently the LCD and battery bacpac are not in stock on GoPro website and I assume that with the new 1180mAH battery, GoPro would soon launch a new bacpac so hold a little if you want to get the new product. GoPro would soon launch backdoors for new casing so meanwhile you can use older casing with the LCD and battery bacpac.Note on microSD card compatibilityA lot of HERO3 issues were related to unsupported/slower microSD cards and even though now you can find a list of supported cards on GoPro website, not all of them can take full advantage of the Black Edition. If the GoPro HERO3 BE or HERO3+ Black Edition detects an unsupported or slower card, then it automatically reduces the recording bitrate from 45Mb/sec to 35Mb/sec while shooting in 4K, 2.7K and Protune video modes.

Kudos to GoPro for addressing that issue.  Camera housing is much smaller overall too which is nice.  I don't use the GoPro app much, but I did test it out and the Wifi IS much quicker as they claim.CONS:  (Very surprised there is no review mentioning this issue yet...)The 33% sharper lens comes with a trade off.  Backgrounds are blurry.  It's not HORRID, but it's definitely soft like a greasy lens would be  If you have a Hero3 Black to compare footage and stills, give it a shot.  It's pretty obvious.  Still, it's crazy sharp up close.  So if you're the focus of everything you film, it'll be great for you.  Just don't expect any definition in your surroundings.I'm not even talking about super-far away (which wide angle lenses have never been good at by nature).  I'm talking about subjects and backgrounds around 10' away.  10 feet!It doesn't only affect stills.  It also affects video footage.OVERALL:  Yep!  It's an improvement.  Just about everything on the camera is better except for the lens (which really bothers me).  I just wish they didn't bumble the lens.  :(-------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 12/24/2013As of December 24th, I have the camera I wanted.  After RMA exchange with GoPro, my camera is a thing of beauty.  I gave it an extra star as a result.Certainly was a headache for me, but all is well again.GoPro service is very tight-lipped about the focus issue, and will probably never speak of it officially.  But... they were also very helpful in replacing the camera.I can't wait to be a \"beta tester\" for the Hero4! Lol... it's the GoPro way.I'm still cheesed at you, GoPro, but I love my camera.

Unfortunately, the abysmal customer service experience is driving the rating for this review.The good: The camera takes great still photos and video.  It looks amazing on a hi-definition television.  The camera is easy to use and setup.  Changing settings in the Go Pro app is a very nice touch as well.The bad: I received the camera on December 31 2013.  The camera was purchased to take on a snorkeling trip the second week in January.  After a few uses, the camera froze on January 18. I contacted Go Pro customer service the day that the camera failed and spoke with Thomas who ran through the standard troubleshooting steps on the phone.  After a few minutes, Thomas informed me that I would need to make a warranty claim.  He set it up and told me to call back after the camera had shipped to expedite Go Pro getting a replacement in the mail to me.  I shipped the camera on the 18th but because it was a Saturday, the camera did not actually go out until Monday morning.I called and emailed Monday January 20th to let them know that the camera had shipped.  I received an email from Sterling with the following \u201cThank you for reaching out to us today, I'm glad to hear the package has been shipped! I've created the order for your replacement camera to be shipped out and we will be dropping this in the mail shorty.\u201dI had not received the camera so I called back the following Monday (January 27th).  I can\u2019t remember the name of the person that I spoke with but he informed me that the cameras were back ordered the week before and my replacement had not been shipped yet but the replacement would go out that day.  He told me that if I did not see my replacement by the end of the week to call back.Friday January 31st comes and goes and I still have not received my replacement.  I called Go Pro and spoke with Austin this time.  At this point, I am getting pretty frustrated with all of the lip service!  Austin informs me that the camera had not shipped yet but would that afternoon.  I expressed my frustration with the process and informed him what was told to me in previous conversations.  His response was \u201cwell, sir, that was not what you were told\u201d.  As a matter of fact, it certainly was!  I am again told to call back if I don\u2019t see my replacement by the end of the following week.Friday February 7th comes and no camera.  At this point, I call Go Pro AGAIN and speak with Nicole.  Nicole informs me that she is not showing tracking information, nor is she showing that the camera has shipped. I am pretty irate at this point.  Nicole tells me that she needs to go hunt this down and asks if she can call me back.  Based on the poor customer service experience so far, I ask her is she is taking hours or a few days before she would have an answer and call me back.  Nicole states that she will call me back within the hour.  This was at 2:50 PM.At 5 PM, I had not yet heard back from Nicole.  I called Go Pro back AGAIN.  This time I spoke with Ryan.  Ryan puts me on hold for a few minutes to research the issue.  When he gets back on the line, he proceeds to tell me that the camera STILL has not shipped because Go Pro did not fill out the shipping information correctly\u2026specifically, they had entered a billing address but no shipping address!  Are you kidding me?  Why was no one else able to fix the issue, or at a minimum, figure out that the camera was never shipped.  Ryan was helpful and very apologetic.  He shipped the camera and I should have it tomorrow.  Nicole never called back either to make sure that everything was squared away.I guess when you are pretty much the only game in town you can treat customers any way that you want.  While I have no issues with the fact that the camera froze (seems a bit odd, but sometimes things happen), I am appalled at the manner with which the \u201ccustomer service\u201d people treated the entire issue.

playing around with this camera, I am really really happy with it. Battery life has consistently been around 2 hrs, which should provide you with ample time of recording. Buttons are all still working well, no issues there, the wireless trigger runs pretty well, albeit a little slow. I really cannot complain about this camera, and given my past with GoPro cameras, this is saying a good amount.BUY THIS CAMERA FROM AMAZON, DO NOT BUY FROM GOPRO. I hate giving GoPro money, because they have awful customer service and for a period of two years sent me broken camera after broken camera. However, the footage that you get from these cameras are second to none. Feel free to read my review of the Hero3 (http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RRHRRBEKP0CC/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm) if you want to get a review on that camera and of the company.Have a great holiday season, thanks for reading my review!NEW UPDATE 10/26/13To start off, one common theme of the GoPro cameras throughout their existence is that the video quality has been top notch. Even on the older models where the cameras were much maligned (and rightfully so), nobody could write off the beautiful video that the camera COULD obtain (when it worked). This was the major underlying reason why these cameras were so loved/hated; when they worked, they'd take incredible video, but, they often had many bugs and flaws.The GoPro Hero3 was a SIGNIFICANT upgrade over the hero2 in terms of video quality. I was one of the first to get that camera and couldn't believe how much better the quality was. Not simply in terms of resolution, but light sensitivity, frame rate, depth of field; the video that the camera could record was stunning. However, as I alluded to before, this camera was so full of bugs you could have taught an entomology class on it! To compound issues, GoPro had AWFUL customer service and no ways to resolve the problems that these cameras faced.Enter the Hero3+. In many ways, this camera is very much like its predecessor. While being a little smaller, having the case slimmed down, the guts are almost the same, and the video quality is almost the same too. They have added a \"super\" mode, which is supposed to produce even better quality video, however I have not seen much of an effect while using it (keep in mind, you have to drop the frame rate to use it). However, they have really fixed a LOT of small issues which make this camera worth the $400.The BIGGEST change they have done on this camera is FIXED THE BATTERY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!! The 30% increase is misleading; I would normally only get about 20-30 minutes of recording time on my old hero3, but now with the hero3+, I recored for 2 hours on one battery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's almost a 400% increase! I don't know what they did to increase it so much, but this was one of THE most frustrating aspects of the camera. Now that you can safely record on one battery for the majority of whatever you're doing, you don't have to worry about changing the battery, getting the camera dirty/wet, and fussing with it when you may not be in a good environment to do so (mud/snow/water/dirt...). I have tried many times recording on this camera, and I can say with confidence that the battery life is far far improved.I recently attended the Albuquerque, NM hot air balloon festival, and took some video with the GoPro to demonstrate a few things. While this video may look good, keep in mind that the quality is severely handcuffed since Amazon limits the size to 100mb.1.) The dynamic range of this camera is great. You'll see it capture both light and dark areas extremely well; this was early early morning and there were a ton of shadows as the sun was starting to rise. It did a great job keeping everything evenly lit and balanced.2.) Pronounced fish eye. This is good/bad, because you'll be able to capture a large range of field from the camera's view point, however the edges are very fish eyed.3.) I naturally want to hold the camera on the black frame that houses the lens, however you may see on the video that my finger kinda pops into the frame of the video. BE CAREFUL IF SHOOTING WITH HANDS!! The lens must be set to record everything directly outside of that black frame, so don't put anything near there.4.) Frame rate is great at 1080, but for anything above, it is garbage. It may seem attractive to some people to shoot video in 2.7K and 4K, however you are not going to want to after trying. The frame rate is way to slow to make any jump in resolution worth it. Even these hot air balloons, which rise slowly, still look bad in the 2.7k resolution. 1080 is where it is at.5.) Not sure if this is an isolated occurrence, but 720 does not look good at all. Very grainy, very choppy, and I didn't like the video at all. Stick to 1080.Of note: The camera did freeze on me once, but this only happened once, as compared to dozens of times with the hero3. Not perfect, but a huge improvement.Hope this helps!! I have a lot more video I can upload at a later time, let me know if you have any questions!10/4/13:At first glance, the Hero3+ does not look much different than the Hero3. The packaging is the same, the accompanying accessories are the same, however as the title implied, there are a bunch of small improvements that are of note.1.) The lock button is SIGNIFICANTLY upgraded. For users of the Hero3, this may have been one of the more frustrating aspects of the camera. There was a two step mechanism required to unlock the case, which often got jammed with mud/dirt/debris, and even after rigorous cleaning made for difficult operation. They have improved the lock mechanism to one big bar that flips open without much effort or strain. Much MUCH easier to use, and I'm sure will be MUCH more durable.2.) The buttons controlling the camera are WAY easier to use. I have been a Hero user since the original models, and these two buttons, on the side and on the top, have always been extremely difficult to push/get to respond. This new case/camera has reworked the sensitivity of these buttons and as a result, all you need is a simple push to get the camera to respond. While this may not seem like much, those buttons were such an annoyance previously that this upgrade helps out a LOT.3.) Battery life. If the case lock was not the worst aspect of the Hero3, the battery life was. For an event covering 2 hours, I had to bring 3 batteries and HOPE that they got me through. I brought this camera to the Bills vs. Browns game last night, and recorded a ton of footage with a lot of pictures and the battery didn't drop one bar throughout the entire game!!! THIS IS A HUGE UPGRADE. From other tests that I've done, I have been able to record about two hours of video before the battery died (shooting 1080p 48fps) and I cannot stress enough how big of an improvement this is.4.) New Video modes. As you'll read about in the product description, they have included new \"super\" video modes for 1080p and 720p. While the video looks good on it, one thing to note is that these \"super\" modes are unable to be shot at the full FPS that the regular 1080p and 720p modes can handle (1080p can shoot 60fps, at super it is at 48).Overall, GoPro has address the MAJOR critiques to their product and should be commended for this new iteration. While there aren't any new significant additions/features/toys, they have SIGNIFICANTLY improved the existing Hero3, and finally made it worth a $400 investment.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Focus issue!!!", "Author": "kwh", "ReviewID": "R1HZZI1P2LZ3ML", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The depth of field is horrible.

What's different, how does it work on its own, is it worth an upgrade? Let's find out.OUT OF THE BOXFirst out is the camera, as it's nicely mounted in the glass container at the top of the box. It's already obvious the new housing for the Hero3+ is noticeably smaller and more compact than the older one. The housing buttons are larger and easier to press, but everything else was downsized. The latch no longer requires an extra tab to slide over, yet still feels very secure and tight when closed. The front covering over the lens has become simplified as there are no longer rivets or a large bezel adding to bulk.There is some concern this could reduce durability, but short of throwing it into a wall, I'm going to just base this on look and feel. Which is to say it appear to be just a solid and durable as the old one. Otherwise the camera itself is identical in size to the old one, so everything is interchangeable. Extra batteries and cables will work just fine with both. You can check the product description to see what exactly is included, but it's just the basics. A few basic mounting brackets, stickers, mini-USB cable, etc. No charger is included.CAMERA SETUPAfter charging, the first step will be to supply a micro-sd card. I did run into an issue where my 32GB Sandisk Class 10 card wouldn't work. I just got an Error on the display. Despite manually cleaning and formatting the card to the specific exFat file system the camera required, it was never happy. At least not until I found the menu option within the camera itself to format the card for me (trash can icon). After that, it's been working great.Speaking of the menu, going through the initial setup via the on-board controls is still as annoying as it was in the previous version. In other words, we have the same basic menu layout and 2 buttons to change menus and make your selections. If you've used them before, you're all set. If not, I do suggest going over the user's guide which has a menu layout that'll help you find what you want and avoid getting lost. As this camera has wireless functionality, it's usually best to get this part setup and use your smartphone to connect and make changes.The GoPro Android app, which I'm using on 2 separate phones, worked great. I used my LG G2 and Note 2 so we could test them out separately. There was virtually no difference between the two, other than the additional video modes the Hero3+ added in the drop-down menus. The preview still has a 1-2 second delay, but more than enough as a basic view-finder. Once again, really no change on the software side of things. At least nothing cosmetic.VIDEO QUALITYThis is of course the important part. So for this test I've basically got them mounted side-by-side on the windshield of the car. Both phones were wirelessly connected to the android phones as well we could easily make identical changes on the fly. Testing was done in daylight and in multiple different video modes. You can check Amazon or GoPro's website to see an exact list of video mode changes going to the plus model, but the important ones are some things that have trickled down from the older Black Series.This includes 1080p @ 60hz, 960p @ 60hz, and 720p @ 120hz which is basically double the frame-rate of older GoPro Silver. Whether I was taking advantage of the higher frame rate of the new model, the video quality was noticeable improved. The image was brighter, more vibrant, and seemed to have more detail than the older non-plus model. And once you take advantage of the higher FPS, action shots look considerably smoother.The camera's megapixels have dropped from 11MP to 10MP, although I didn't notice any change in still photo quality.  It's also not something I use all that much with the GoPro. Even though it of course has plenty of features such as burst shot mode.AUDIOWhile playing both videos back to back, it's very obvious there is an improvement in audio quality. We're using the same backing (with 2 openings) while it was in the car. With the older model, our voices and other audio were quiet and muffled. But with the plus, our voice was very clear and easy to understand. The audio was simply more crisp and detailed. Really a night and day difference.CURRENT ISSUE (PENDING RESOLUTION)While in the car, I have the cameras mounted upside down. There is a quick setting in each camera to flip the image vertically. However, the new GP3+ also flipped the image horizontally, something the old one didn't do. This of course creates a very odd perspective as it makes it appear as though you're on the wrong side of the road. This occurred at any resolution where the image had to be flipped to upside down mode. With the free downloadable GoPro video editing software, you can of course manually flip the video horizontally, but it's certainly not ideal.I'm still working with GoPro to find a resolution. We've already swapped out the camera and the new one does the same thing. Will update when I have more info.PROS:+ More compact housing+ Increased battery capacity+ Improved High resolution video quality+ Noticable audio quality improvement+ Higher FPS video recording at all HD resolutions+ Durable and Waterproof (in housing)+ Wireless smartphone connectivity+ Has most important features of older Black seriesCONS:- Battery life could always be better- Menu controls can still be confusing- Slightly expensive- Camera gets very warm- Picky with SD card formatting- Current horizontal flip issue (pending resolution)CONCLUSION:Overall there wasn't much to dislike about the new camera. Considering its intended purpose, I don't think you can really find anything better for the money. The GoPro Hero3+ Silver basically offers many of the improved video quality/FPS of the older Black series, for less money. And other than 4K recording of the new Black series, the Silver series fits into a nice \"mid-range\" providing everything most folks are looking for. All while making several minor but very welcome design improvements.Bottom line, spend a little more for the new plus model and you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Messed up focus", "Author": "Roller", "ReviewID": "R7JIIB7Z18MF1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "A significant downgrade to my Hero 3 Black, the 3+ Black is out of focus for anything past a few metres.

So you may want to look into that and picking up an extra battery. It does have better image quality. The big changes are from the casing, which is smaller and lighter, and from the improved battery both of which could easily be upgraded too. Although the lens has been improved the quality of footage from the previous black edition was already excellent so if there is a difference it really is only marginal. The new improved casing doesn't allow you to go as deep in the water as the previous model. But still accepts your Hero 3:BE cases which is a huge plus. As well as let you use the older batteries.

I mainly use it on fishing/boating trips.  I went out on a boating/fishing trip this past weekend.  I arrived at my location before dawn, so I took some pictures and videos in very low light conditions.  I took several pictures and video on the water.  I am pleasantly surprised with the picture quality/clarity.I've owned GoPro cameras since they first came out.  I've owned 1 original Hero, 2 Hero2 and 2 Hero3 Black Edition cameras.  I use them to video/document severe weather events and fishing/boating trips.  I purchased 1 Hero3 Black Edition and did have the problems many other customers had with their cameras.  I purchased one directly from GoPro and purchased another from Amazon.  GoPro replaced the one directly purchased from them (I got super lucky and the replacement unit worked perfectly).  The one purchased from Amazon worked great right out of the box.  Again, I got very lucky.The quality of the lens has improved drastically over the different models.  Just going from the original Hero to the Hero2, image quality really improved.  I thought the picture clarity/quality was superb with the Hero3 Black Edition....well, the picture clarity resolution has improved with the Hero3+ Black edition over the Hero3 Black Edition.I have taken several videos with the low light option turned on..it is better than the Hero3 Black.  Video quality is less grainy.  IMHO, you can't expect great videos in very low light from a $400 camera, it's just not going to happen.As for the comment on here about the focus is not as good far away as it is close up...the pictures and videos I've taken so far, the focus seems to be about as good as it was with the Hero3 Black Edition.  Once I do more testing I will update on this subject.As for the new Hero3+ housing...well, I can't say that I like the \"improved\" design. I like that it has a glass lens, but, that is about it.  I don't really like the new style latch.  I'd rather deal with the slightly large housing that has a little extra plastic than use the Hero3+ housing.I guess people who are taking pictures for timelapse use don't mind the longest picture interval is 1 minute.  For me, timelapse intervals of 5 and ten minutes would be great.  I know I can just take a few hundred pictures and go back to delete some of the pictures...but ,that is time consuming.I still need to do testing on the battery and other options.More updates to come with further testing.10/19/13 UpdateI did a lot of comparing photos from my Hero3 BE and this new camera.  The video resolution/clarity is  better at close range but distance focus for pictures and videos is not quiet as sharp...but not nearly a deal breaker as some of the reviews as I've seen.  I've compared videos 1080p from the Hero3 black and Hero3 Plus Black many, many times and I didn't see much (if any) difference.10/21/13 If I could choose 4.5 to 4.8 stars I would...I was never really a fan of any Hero camera for picture taking, I mostly use them for taking videos.  Don't get me wrong, they do take good pictures, I just never really like the fisheye look. For some reason, I don't mind that fisheye look in videos.  I only half agree with the \"blurier\" focus at longer distances now.  I was able to take some more pictures in different situations and most of them did turn out very good, many of them excellent.  The pictures I took with the earlier review was on a very cloudy,dim day.  The pictures were OK.  This round I took on a better day and more on a nice sunny day.  These pictures couldn't have turned out better.  The jury is still out on the focus issue, but, that would not be a reason not to purchase the camera (for my use anyway).  I just wish they had 12 Meg medium view for pictures.The video quality in all resolutions is better than the Hero3 BE.  I took a few videos in 2.7k resolution and all I can say is WOW.  The resolution is amazing.  It almost looks like you are still there in the moment.Even though the actual battery is a slightly larger mAh battery, it does last longer than the Hero3 BE.Testing the GoPro App, the video preview delay has been cut in half for the Andriod App, but, not so much with the iOS.  Control changes do happen almost instantly.102713 - Update - I should upgrade to 5 stars, but will keep it at 4 stars for now...I've taken at about 30 videos and 50 pictures at different resolutions.  I gotta say that there must be bad cameras being shipped as there was with the original Hero3 Black editions.  I am reading that a few people are having issues with blurry or out of focus pictures.  I gotta say that the majority of my pictures I've taken...couldn't have turned out any better quality.  I still do not like pictures taken with GoPro cameras, but, I cannot knock the image quality.The video quality in any resolution is just amazing...period.  I've taken videos in 720 regular and superview, 1080 regular and superview and 2.7k resolution and the video quality is superb.  The video doesn't look likes it's video, it looks as if you are still there.Most of my videos and pictures are taken during snow and boating/fishing trips.  So far all my videos have been on the water.  The video quality cannot be beaten for a video recorder at this price.I can very well understand the frustration of receiving a products that does work.  I dealt with a Hereo3 Black edition that had a mind of its own.  When it worked, I loved it.  I spent plenty of time pulling my hair out over it not working, but, the videos I got from it when it did work were really good.I'm also impressed with the improved battery life.  I didn't do any exact testing, but I took several videos in 1080 regular, 1080 superview videos and several 10 minutes 720/720 superview videos and still had 2 battery bars left.  Did not charge the battery overnight and the next day took more videos and pictures and never had any battery issues.  That's quite different from how the Hero3 Black Edition was.  I hated the battery life for the Hero3 Black edition.11/06/13This part of the review is more to do with the GoPro App...iOSI installed something call Bluestacks which allows a Mac user to install iOS apps on a Mac.  I do not own a tablet nor do I really want one.  My 13 inch Macbook Pro is portable enough.  Well, I've played around with the iOS version of GoPro App on my Macbook Pro and I must admit I really like it.  My preview works, the only thing I cannot do is playback videos on the Hero3 sd card, but I can view stored pictures.12/21/13 - Still LOVE the camera!", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Coming from Canon EOS DSLR's this is a Quirky Camera but to my surprise works quite well once you get used to it.", "Author": "salty dawg", "ReviewID": "R2DCT3D2L27H47", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my 1st GoPro so there was a slight learning curve - I have to say this is a troubled product - the GoPro cameras are well built and deliver stunning video in good light (they are not low light cameras)considering their price point and small footprint they have NO Competition as of yet - their history however suggests they have never been bug free and have had numerous glitches over the years - with most resolved via firmware upgrades  - the 3+ Black edition is as all have stated an improvement over the 3 Black edition in the area of battery life, lens capabilities, plus additional frame rates and a new smaller case but overall not much different from the 3 Black and even share the same sensor - with hardware and software experience I can tell you most of the issues with the 3+ are software. This is good news because it's within the realm of the Mfr to resolve.The current firmware version is quite functional but has issues in that it frequently uses timing intervals to resolve functional ambiguity - translation - it's slow to respond so don't hurry the camera when changing modes, or other functions including shutdown and start-ups or you might get into trouble with looping due to inadequate timing code break points designed to resolve nested looping errors - i.e. if you get this camera confused (actually over loaded with executions for the CPU real time available) you will have to take the Battery out to get the camera to function again and most likely will have corrupted the memory to the point that it will require re-formatting before it will read and write.I ran my camera hard after discovering this and could easily create these issues over and over plus many more like the camera not being recognized by my workstation and corrupting the memory card resulting in the loss of all data.Memory - the 3+ is very fussy with the type of memory used especially if you shoot 4K - I suggest the Samsung Electronics 64GB Pro microSDXC Extreme Speed (UHS-1) Class 10... this memory has never given me any trouble but many others have so I stick with it.Having stated these issues, I still rated the camera 4 stars because once you get used to the quirks of the interface it actually works quite well  - be advised though - no matter how skilled you get there will still be those times when you will have to take the battery out or remove the memory card and jack it into an external reader in order to read the memory card or recover control of the camera.One more subject - the lens focus issue - Yup it's true the lens is very sharp in close but goes soft after 10-15 feet and from there out gets worse - in comparison the model 3 Black does NOT DO THIS - so if you are thinking of using this for aerial video - forget it or take your chances that the mfr will fix this.I called the Go Pro customer service before purchasing my unit and the rep that answered said she was not aware of this issue - she then said can you hold I'll ask the tech's - after a few min she returned and told me that they were aware of the problem and working on a SOFTWARE SOLUTION (THE TRUTH SO HELP ME) ... I took them at their word and bought the camera - only time will tell if I made a bad decision because I use it with a DJI Phantom Quad copter.Well if they don't resolve the focus issue I guess I could take up surfing and use it with a 10 foot pole - focus within that range is excellent!UPDATE on Focus Problem with the early Hero 3+ Black cameras *** GoPro is about to release the firmware solution for this issue - preliminary release is herehttps://s3.amazonaws.com/support_upload ...

I thought that people must be abusing these and that's why they were dying.  Or that people just could not follow instructions.  Not the case.Ours was never dropped or mishandled.

And 5 weeks in we go to turn it on (and it does sometimes turn on) and it won't cycle through modes or take a movie or stills.Sometimes it won't even turn on.We've tried charging.  We've tried swapping batteries.  We even tried the reset we saw in a video on You Tube. (I doubt that this is truly a reset as even for the person demonstrating it, the camera was still doing crazy stuff and/or failing to operate).So far, GoPro is acting like nothing is wrong.  Trust me, something is terribly wrong either in the software or the build quality of the camera.  Or both.  Given the issues with ours, my guess is hardware.  But given the issues I have seen in YouTube videos it could either or both.Four weeks of GoPro support and I am $45 poorer and no nearer a solution.GoPro asserted right away that the problem was most likely not with their camera but with the expensive Sandisk Extreme Micro SD card I was using.  They would not proceed with any troubleshooting until I purchased and tested a new Micro SD card.  Now I have 2 Sandisk Extreme Micro SD cards which work perfectly everywhere except in my GoPro.  A month has gone by and though I am now out the money for a second SD card, I am no closer to a solution.GoPro support is very slow.  They take 3 days to respond to your initial inquiry and every exchange back and forth usually takes another 2-3 days.  Of course, along the way they have you repeat steps you've already tried from viewing their support online and also reading forums and watching other videos from people who have had their GoPro cameras \"brick\" on them as well.I'm now at a point where I've done everything I can do and GoPro SHOULD be shipping me a new camera.  Instead, they want me to re-format my Micro SD card and try again.  They want me to do this because they do not want to ship me a new camera which will also brick on me and require the same memory reset.  Here are their exact words from an email.\"However, I don't want you to get a new camera, just to have it give you the same issues which can be corrected with a software re-update and a working SD card.\"In other words, they know their cameras are prone to bricking and that in some cases reinstalling the software solves the problem.  However, if you will read the other * reviews, you will see that a lot of us have simply been ripped off.  GoPro's support is so slow and expensive that I'm sure most people just give up and throw out their cameras.  Especially if GoPro admits the same thing to them--that these cameras are prone to failure and requiring a re-update of their software.GoPro has one last chance to get this right for me.  They can send me a brand new camera.  I do not want a refurb--that's just a camera that's already proved it was defective.

Though intended for recording far more active people and activities than I will ever engage in, the GoPro Hero3+ Black Edition (\"BE\"), has quickly won a place in my heart.In fact, I love it.The GoPro Hero3+ BE is tiny, light, can be mounted virtually anywhere, has excellent optics, uses powerful CODECS to produce high-quality still and video images, can be controlled remotely with a dedicated remote control or an iOS or Android device. Though it isn't a feature I'll use much, use the proper case and it is water-proof to 131 feet beneath the surface.The range of shooting modes available on the Hero3+ BE is mind-blowing. There are nine video capture modes, four photo resolutions, three continuous photo modes, seven burst photo options (including a staggering 30 photos in 1 second) and seven time lapse intervals.The lens is fixed, but has a wide angle of view. If you've ever done any street photography yourself or are familiar with work of masters like Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Frank, you know they generally used lenses between 28 and 50mm. Wide is good. The Hero3+ BE is surprisingly responsive: press the shutter release and you've snapped your picture without major lag.I have to chuckle a bit as I contemplate the coming Chicago winter. I'll be walking the local streets, using a walker to keep me upright, with the GoPro in its waterproof case, the wireless remote in my glove. Set to one of the burst modes, I'm going to be in street photographer's heaven with visions of being revered as the new Cartier-Bresson dancing in my head.The reality is that ordinary people pursuing their ordinary lives is action - just not the kind of action most people rightfully associate with GoPro cameras. It's more modest, but to a guy who despaired of ever again capturing a \"decisive moment\", as Henri Cartier-Bresson called it, the GoPro is a miracle.Image quality is excellent. No, not as good as the classic Leica, Schneider, Nikkor, Canon and other top-end lenses, but far more than merely adequate. In any event, for the kind of photography I intend to do, content is more important than tack sharpness.Battery life is fine, in my opinion, but it isn't something that really concerns me: I always carry extra batteries. So much better safe than sorry in that regard.Like most people, I hope never to have to need a vendor's tech support, especially in this era of off-shored, script readers who clearly know nothing of the product. I needed GoPro support because of a problem I encountered with the Hero3+ BE WiFi. Color me very, very impressed. The GoPro tech support representative I dealt with was very knowledgeable, listened carefully and, generally speaking, was an absolute pleasure to deal with and, best of all, resolved the issue.I will be adding to this review to cover features that I haven't yet fully explored. Learning al the capabilities of this camera is well worth the investment of time.It should be apparent that I am totally enraptured with the GoPro Hero3+ BE. Performance overall is more than adequate. The low-light capabilities are, frankly, surprisingly good. Yes, the camera has limitatiions - it is not going to replace my Nikons with all their lenses. But the reality is that I can't really carry and usae the Nikons any more and for what I want to capture, the GoPro Hero3+ BE is a miracle machine.Jerry", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lemon of a Product, even worse \"Customer Service\"!", "Author": "Joe Walsh", "ReviewID": "R3H3ZIJ8L7WAAE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was very excited after reading the reviews of the Black Edition but found the product and especially GoPro service to be terrible.

After calling back to GoPro I was told that it could be a bad battery and it could take up to 14 days for them to send me another one after I filled out forms for them.  Ridiculous, I just spend $400 for a GoPro to go on a ski vacation... it never worked for the vacation and now after numerous attempts at fixing it GoPro was telling me to fill out more forms and they would do nothing to rush me any parts to repair it.  I expressed my disappointment with buying a product that did not work and getting the absolute run around with customer service (note to GoPro... stand behind your products or your customers will not... have policies that promote taking case of the customer if your products are defective... new net promoter score is below zero in my mind).Don't waste your money on bad products with bad customer service.

I bought this camera for both action shoots and time-lapse no-scope astro-photography.Some Observations:* The camera is tiny: much smaller and lighter than the pictures would let you believe. It comfortably sits on the palm of your hand.* Wi-Fi is a battery vampire. In my tests, it will cut published battery life in about half. And unless you have the live view BackPack, you are going to need it together with the GoPro app.* Without a heavy investment on accessories/harnesses/handles/leashes, you will find yourself with a $300 paperweight, for all action videography intents and purposes.* The ultra-wide has quite a bit of barrel distortion at the edges, but this is normal for this type of lens.The disappointment:As mentioned above, I had two purposes in mind for this camera: 1) I wanted a good under-water and action/rugged video and still camera to tote along when we go on family trips. 2) I like doing no-scope, time-lapse astrophotography and this is where this camera falls flat on its face. I ran several tests with good light and \"night\" light. time-lapses of clouds and of stars. And anything out in infinity came very soft, even at the center of the frame. This was a disappointment because my bud's GP2 takes much, much, much better pictures and time lapses than this much newer model. Then as some suggested, I took still pictures of myself and people standing within 10-15 feet were also soft-focused and not in a good way. Another disappointment that I mentioned above is that Wi-Fi will suck the life out of the battery really, really fast. On a full charge, I took about 32 minutes of video and about 17 still pictures before GP3+ battery dies on me.All in all, these issues are simply too important for me and am returning the camera as we speak.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Never Worked", "Author": "Mario Marmo", "ReviewID": "R36WK3OIOBEY9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I dont know if i had bad luck, but the camera had problems turning on.

It's terribly upsetting that such an expensive product would be so faulty.I'm in Asia now and the only way to get the GoPro to work is manually taking the battery out and putting it back in again. This works about 30% of the time.

The camera itself is very lightweight and portable almost to the point of feeling like a toy.  Once it is in its waterproof housing it feels more rugged and \u201cprofessional.\u201d  The image quality is impressive for its small size though it is far behind consumer HD camcorders.  I tried the silver edition which features 1080p at 60 fps.  This allowed for very smooth video with the ability to edit and review the footage with detailed slow motion or frame by frame views.  There were some issues in low light and also with contrast (especially with the auto white balance) but overall the video looks good for a rugged camcorder.One of the touted features of the GoPro Hero is the GoPro App which lets you use your cellphone as a viewfinder for the camcorder via the GoPros built in wifi.  This feature was something I was really looking forward to on this camera but unfortunately  it did not work despite hours of troubleshooting.  I tried a number of solutions including updating the cameras firmware but it would not connect successfully. I even tried different phones (including an iPhone and several Android devices) but it simply did not work.  Many of the user forums also speak about this issue which makes this  a big negative especially considering the price of this device.*** Positive Points: ***- Good (though not great) image quality- Excellent waterproof housing- User replaceable battery- A wide variety of mounts and accessories are available- Bright LED is easy to see (especially underwater)- Decent amount of menu options*** Negative Points: ***- The Wifi feature that connects with the GoPro App did not work despite updating the software- Has some issues with contrast and low light situations- The Menu system takes some time to get used to though the learning curve is fairly simple- LCD screen is small and can be difficult to read especially in low light since the screen is not backlit- It gets very hot (especially in the waterproof housing)- ExpensiveOverall:  The GoPro Hero 3+ is great if you need need to capture video in rugged situations. It loses points for its patchy wifi connectivity with the GoPro App and for its flaws with white balance and low light.

Had it mounted to my hard hat most of the time, and handheld for some tighter areas.Low Light: This is important to me, as the places I explore tend to be dark. You have to manually activate the \"low light\" mode. If you move from dark to light, the light will be briefly blown-out. Moving from light to dark, colors are off for a few seconds. That said, the low light is much better than with previous models. Low light ramps down the FPS. The 4K setting is supposed to have even better low light performance, but I did not try that. If you don't activate the low light setting, the low light performance is the same as the previous model. If you're shooting conditions have a lot of dark to light transitions, I would avoid using this setting. For example, in a dark building where you're walking through pools of bright light, or at night it you wind up shooting into headlights.Smaller and lighter: This applies to the housing only. The Hero 3 housing latch was over-complicated. The Hero3+ is much simpler and more compact - it's obviously much cheaper. The latch is not nearly as heavy duty as on previous models.2x faster - only on the Silver.Faster WiFi and app: I really did not notice a difference. The smartphone app had limited functionality until I removed and replaced the it. Apparently the app does not auto-update. After re-installing everything, the app worked fine. The camera has so many features and functions, you really need to use an app to get the most out of it.  The app is also a great replacement for the LED back - use your smartphone or tablet instead! The default password for wifi is \"goprohero\".Depth rating has changed: This new housing is waterproof to 40 meters/130 feet (was 60 meters/196 feet). The previous housing (Hero 3) is now called a \"dive housing\" (optional accessory) and will keep the camera dry down to 60 meters.Lens: I also noticed that objects further than 10' away are not crisp. I wish that this was a setting, or that the Hero had a full manual mode. If you're into selfies or shooting yourself at arms/ski poles/etc. length, this is great.  Want that crisp distance shot?

However, after seeing some of the videos possible with this camera I purchased the Hero 3: White edition with the new housing.After using this for some weeks, I can say I love this camera and the possibilities.1.: What's in the box?: You receive the camera with the waterproof housing, plus an instruction booklet and a quick start guide.  In addition, you receive a micro-USB cable, plus some mounts and assorted 'thingies.'2.  Aesthetic?:  Well, who really cares how this looks since the point is to capture your desired personal aesthetics!  But, compared to some of the other cameras I have seen, this is a small package, and is cleverly designed.3.  Use?:  The point of the camera is to get it working.  The waterproof casing has been redesigned from the previous model.  It does seem very well-done and is supposedly able to survive to 130 feet.  I have not tested it to any depth with the camera inside.  However, I have taken the housing and placed it under water without a problem.  (I will update this when I get the chance for some waterproof filming).The camera itself has basically three buttons. One for the power/mode, one for the camera to start taking video or pictures (at the top) and a side button which powers wireless.  The wireless function works in conjunction with the App, which I used with an Iphone.  The app is fantastic!  You can control the camera remotely and change the desired function (video, burst, lapse and single pictures, plus whatever function suite the users purposes).  The best thing is the ability to see a preview (except in certain modes like a time-lapse) and the ability to see the pictures and video on the app.  Fantastic.The pictures with the edition I purchased are good, not great, given the 5 MP capability and the close-in build for pictures (I didn't but this to take long-range pictures). However, the video in HD (and this should be changes to 1080 as the default is a bit less) is absolutely gorgeous.  Stunning is the word. The sound is also great, even with the waterproof housing on.  I could still hear myself, others and the sounds of the activity clearly.The wireless function relies on setting up an internal network between your mobile device and the camera, though I did not find this difficult at all.  The only time I had difficulty getting the camera connection was during some very cold weather, and once the camera was warm this went away.  The battery lasts about 2 hours with consistent use, which is pretty good, although I could nurse the camera by turning things on and off when the opportunity present itself.At first, I did not like having to use a micro-SD card, but this is actually okay with an adapter for actual use and allows makes the camera smaller than the previous model.Overall, so far, I am very pleased with the camera and what it allows me to accomplish without too much difficulty.  I suggest that a buyer purchase the grabbag of extra mounts and the lens caps as well.  Great item. Hopefully I do not encounter some of the difficulty that others have had with the camera.

I was disappointed that the camera doesn't come with a standard tripod mount (or an included SD card, so make note!), but after using it a bit, it becomes obvious that the camera's designed for more extreme filming situations, like being strapped/clipped onto things and going along for the ride.  For this reason, the controls are minimal and the unit operates with the use of only a couple buttons and pretty loud beeps to tell you it's following your instructions (there's no view screen or way to see what you're filming live unless you link the camera to a phone or other mobile device wirelessly)--this basically means you pretty much have to read at least some of the instructions to use the camera effectively.  A pretty big change for me, who's used to using my Canon Rebel for what little video I shoot.  One of the handiest things about the instructions is that they offer recommendations for the quality level you should use for different specific applications, which isn't always the highest quality.  I need to use the camera more to get a better, more well-rounded understanding of its capabilities, but after the filming I've done so far, I'd say this camera won't replace something like a Canon Rebel's (or, of course, an actual digital camcorder designed to specialize in video) ability to view the filming live, adjust zoom, have a slightly nicer mic, etc., but you can certainly put it in situations a regular camera could never withstand.

Most of my review is comparing this with the previous model -- which are *mostly* improvements.I received this camera right after a snorkeling trip to Hawaii, so unfortunately, I was unable to test the HERO3+ underwater. Nonetheless, I put it through the paces in my car and at home to get a feel like what it might be like in more extreme activities outside - biking, go-karting, watersports, etc. The result of that is on this review, though Amazon doesn't support HD video, so you won't get a perfect idea of real world video from the device. After taking a 10 minute video and setting up Wifi, battery life was already below 75%. Perhaps this is because I was playing around with the device setup using more juice, but this doesn't bode well for hours of video at a time without a recharge. Note I used SanDisk Class 10 MicroSD cards to record.With the Wifi features (described in the next paragraph), the total number of buttons on the camera comes to three. It is relatively simple to use the camera, but still requires a bunch of button presses to change settings and you have to get accustomed to pressing which button for the action you want to perform while reading the tiny LCD. Not terribly difficult, but not \"Apple simple\" either. You've got plenty of options for still photos and multiple video resolutions. I'm happy with close-ups and distance shots -- they seem quite clear at 1080p -- and smoother than the original HD HERO. I didn't try out the 4K -- I don't even have any displays that can support that resolution.All the same accessories that I personally have for my HD HERO -- which the exception of the floaty backdoor (because of a different size camera) -- work with the HERO3+. This edition comes with a wifi remote (which was easy to setup per the instructions) and the ability to access the video and settings with a iOS/Android/Windows mobile device. This makes it MUCH easier to configure the device (rather than via the on-camera menus) and get a quick preview before you get into precarious activities, somewhat negating my previous comments about ease of use. In the box there is also a standard mini-USB charging/sync cord (this really should be micro-USB), another proprietary charging cord (ugh) for the wi-fi remote, instructions, battery, pivot arms/buckles, the camera housing with closed and semi-open cover, and one flat and one curved mount (you'll probably be looking for other mounts after purchase ... for this price I would have hoped GoPro included more.)Unlike the HD HERO which includes component and composite cables, video output options require the purchase of more accessories -- at least a standard micro HDMI will work if you so desire. Behind the removable door (GoPro, why didn't you make this swing open so you don't lose the plastic piece?) is the slot for the MicroSD card and mini USB jack as well. Coming from the HD HERO, I now needed MicroSD cards since the previous model used standard SD cards. Again, not included, so adding to your outright cost if you don't already own.Overall, I dock the camera one star for the lack of accessories and average battery life -- especially given the price. Otherwise I'm very happy with the image quality -- and hopefully the durability during more extreme use of the camera. And if you don't need the super high resolution or perhaps even the wifi remote (the app will still work), the lower cost white or silver editions might suffice for you.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelent product", "Author": "Langer", "ReviewID": "R387XS2JUKV5B2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Yes, it eats batteries a lot !

I have tried several video editing software programs and they are all very complicated.So, I went for the burst option which allows you to take 3 pictures in 1 second. The camera itself can be be controlled with an app on the Iphone. The app itself is pretty neat. You can sit nearby out of sight and monitor what the camera sees on the iphone until the perfect picture comes up - then you hit the button. But, a few problems:(1) The WIFI feature will not go through a single pane window. My squirrel feeder is about 25 feet from my dining room. but, there is a window between me and the feeder. The APP loses the camera's WIFI through the window. I have to go outside and sit on the patio in order to be able to manipulate the camera with WIFI.(2) BE careful! From a full charge, when you turn on the WIFI, your battery will go dead in about an hour. They really need to do something about this.But, I am happy with the purchase.

This is a drastic improvement over my Hero2, even with the battery backpak. It is also a bit smaller and lighter. The lens is a bit of an improvement in areas like near object sharpness. The new video modes for HD don't really impress me as the frame rate drops to get them. I find the color to be superior to the Hero2, it's quite a bit more vivid, without looking fake.  It's also far superior to the Hero2 in low-light shooting. WiFi is an \"upgrade\" of sorts from the Hero2. It isn't a simple setup and it drains the battery quickly and doesn't have a very long range. The close stills are as good as my HTC phone, not as good as my iPhone 5.  Sound capture was very good, I found it clearer than the Hero2.The major con for me is that objects about 8-10 feet away are blurred. I find this unacceptable for action video as the background is as important to me as the foreground. The still shots suffer from this as would be expected.The camera is constructed every bit as solid as the Hero2. I would still expect to use bacpak batteries for longer shoots.Also, all my shooting was done on fast, high quality class 10 SD cards.  Don't cheap out here or you will definitely be unsatisfied with the video!Overall, it's a decent camera for the price, the blurring of slighlty distant objects may not bother others as it does me, so I can't not recommend it based on that.  The near objects are very crisp.  However, if the budget allows, I would look at the Hero3+ Black Edition and compare.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Save $100 and go SILVER instead of BLACK", "Author": "Doug Peterson", "ReviewID": "RC91N5OEM2ZAF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Black Edition GoPro based on the fact that it was the \"top of the line\" of all the GoPro cameras.  I spent some time reading the manual and setting up the camera.  I am really interested in the WiFi setup so that I can view and control the camera remotely.The Black Edition comes with a wireless remote which is linked up to your camera.  However, the Smartphone link-up does the same and much much much more.  So as long as you have a smartphone, save $100 and use that as your remote WiFi link.The other main difference between the Black and the Silver is that the still images can be taken at 12 MP instead of 10 MP - a pretty insignificant difference.Unless you are in a situation where the remote control is much easier to use than a smartphone (android or iPhone), then I would suggest that you go with the Silver Edition which has the same WiFi connectivity as the Black Edition.I considered returning mine after learning about this difference but after spending about 30 minutes trying to figure out how to open the package for my GoPro, I decided that I didn't want to go through that ever again!!!  I many, in fact find some use for the remote control but I definitely see myself using the vastly superior smart phone interface to control this camera.Another point to note - that was not in any of the setup instructions - when linking the GoPro with my Samsung Galaxy S4 I ran into a problem.  The network settings were not linking because of a default Advanced setting on my phone.  To remedy this, I went to Wifi-networks, click the menu button to the left of the home button on the bottom of the phone, click Advanced when the popup window comes up, then go to \"Auto network switch\" and deselect this option.After doing this my phone immediately connected to the GoPro following the instructions from GoPro.  The downfall to deselecting this option is obvious - the phone will automatically switch from one network to another for WiFi service when needed.  So you may have to do some manual switching.Hope this helps someone else having the same issues.  If you end up saving $100 by going for the SILVER as a result of my review, send me $1 on paypal and after I make my hundred back I'll amend this review.  Send to: ty at sportcow and then a dot com.

Keefer \"Star Wars freak\"", "ReviewID": "R23AXSR3JU6CPY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having owned all the various GoPros back to the Hero HD1 I can say that this is by far the best one yet. I had previously owned the Hero 3 and ended up getting rid of it after a couple of months of frustration with it, primarily with the too short battery life. It held great promise with the WiFi integration and the remote as well as the iPhone app giving even greater control. I found the remote to be basically worthless as the wifi put an even greater strain on the already short battery life. Even with the add on battery backpac I was only able to get around 90 minutes of use. Also the remote was not anywhere near as up to the challenges of the camera itself,  after the second replacement I gave it up for good and went back to my previous method of just shooting non stop and cutting everything in editing, more work for me on the backside that I had hoped the remote would streamline. Even then I was missing half my action in the water (I use mine on the deck of my surfboard) to the battery life.But this review is about the new Hero3+. Happy to say the battery life is greatly improved. I'm getting a solid 2 hours+ with just the onboard battery now. I like the smaller frame, though the change means this is the first version that needed a different back door for the add ons. A back door which is still not widely available currently.  I have not tried the remote and don't plan to, I'll still hit start before I paddle out and then chop out the good stuff in editing. This has been made incredibly easy using the updated FREE software from GoPro, Cineform Studio. It makes it a breeze to just cut out the fun clips from the chaff and then knit them together into short videos with musical accompaniment.  The software also allows you to add some basic filters as well as more advanced in software edits to the speed and even framing within the shot. You can even add keyframed zooms which really gives you a lot of control of what was basically a static framed shot.In short, I'm very satisfied with this iteration of the GoPro camera and finally decided to let go of my trusty GoPro Hero2!

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R2VEKHPR13GBEI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "In reviewing the Hero 3+ I have found that no matter the resolution, and no matter the WB nor adjustments I make I cannot get the camera to focus properly. I have taken video with the unit mounted onto my roll bar in my Miata, and the unit has perfect focus on the dash, but is very blurry out the windshield. It likes to also focus on spots on the windshield as well.Going through the features, I have found that the new Superview feature makes for shooting in 1080p and above a better experience. The Superview helps alleviate some of the fish-eye effect from the lens and the unit performs much better overall under different lighting conditions.The WiFi app was fine, as well as the WiFi remote. I did not experience any issues with the unit shutting off randomly, or any other major failures along those lines.The battery life is great on this unit, as I only charged the unit once when first received the camera, and after a few hours of testing, the camera still hasn't warned me of a low battery. The WiFi remote battery did die on me, but I did not charge that device all of the way. I spent most of the time using the iPhone APP. With that said, I did find the mounts included a bit inconvenient. I am used to the ease of use from the Monoprice MHD action cameras and the mounts that GoPro uses are all proprietary. I couldn't use any tripods, or accessories I already owned. I found this terribly inconvenient, as I had to borrow an adapter from a friend to mount it onto my roll bar.Mounted on my helmet, on the right side, just like how I mount to my Monoprice MHD Action cam, the GoPro stuck out almost 4 inches from the side of the helmet, almost 2 inches more than the MHD Action cam. This made the helmet want to lean to the side, and I could feel the cameras heft. I did not like this.Overall, the camera is a fine piece of machinery. I do not like the idea of being locked into the proprietary and bulky mounting system. I also no not like how the unit has a focal distance of about 4 feet. Anything beyond 4 ft is simply not in focus and is blurry. It seriously seems like it would be a factory defect, but after contacting GoPro directly, I have found that this was an intended change to the unit. It was to improve the quality of POV footage. I don't know  about most users, not I don't know any person who uses their GoPro for that kind of video, maybe only reality TV shows.On a 1-10 scale I rate this unit a 6. It may have the best features, and the highest framerates, but if it can't focus on my subjects, it is simply of no use to me.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Upgrade-worthy, focus is fine.", "Author": "Y. R. Wu \"The will to win is nothing without ...", "ReviewID": "R12E2KZ0G4HGVU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Summary: If you have an older HERO2, it's time to upgrade....If you have a White/Silver HERO3, you should seriously consider the HERO3+ Black.I purchased my HERO3 Silver last year shortly after it came out.  At the time, I could get a HERO2 for a much lower price, even after adding WiFi.  I finally decided on the HERO3 Silver for the included dive-capable case (the HERO2 has a curved front which means your underwater footage is distorted)While I've been super happy with the HERO3 silver, I was doing the math on upgrading to the HERO3+ Black, so was super happy to have the opportunity to review it here.The features which were making me consider upgrading were:  1) Faster frame rate on Black (No change in HERO3+, but the Silver's 120 FPS wasn't enough)  2) Longer battery life.  I have a second Wasabi brand battery, but with the HERO3+ and Wifi off, I almost don't need it anymore!  3) More sensitive low light mode  4) SUPERVIEW mode  5) Smaller, lighter case with one handed open/close  6) Improved Wifi range / speedNote that the camera itself is the same size, but the new case is now only rated waterproof to 131 feet, where the prior case was rated to 197 feet.  If you plan to use it scuba diving at that depth, you'll probably need lights so an extra $50 for the sturdier housing probably isn't an issue.Whether you value these features depends on how you use the GoPro.  I do FPV Skiing, Mountain Biking, and then also record my daughters soccer games and swimming.  You can get a better look at the entire field with SUPERVIEW and record the whole game with the longer battery life.  Greater WiFi distance means I can control it from *almost* anywhere on the field (I typically put the camera above the goal or at the halfway sideline)The WiFi app on my Android phone can be buggy depending on when I go in and out of range or if my phone sleeps.  Reconnecting can be a pain.  It's indispensable for adjusting your view on a boom pole, and critical for making sure you have the camera aimed properly.Finally, there is a lot of chatter in the forums on the sharpness/focus of the HERO3+ (Google \" Gopro Hero3+ image quality problem\"). It *appears* that a relatively large number of the initial units were focused too closely - things that are perhaps 50 feet or more away are blurry.  To see if my unit was affected, I took pictures side by side with the HERO3 and HERO3+ and found that my HERO3+ unit was fine - even sharper on tree branches some 150-200 feet away.  GoPro seem to be indicating that the units should be sharper at ALL distances than the HERO3, not just for closer distances.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Camera....I own 3", "Author": "Michael Gall", "ReviewID": "R75GBLGY1HCLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have 3 of these and use them all at the same time.

Hope to upgrade to five after I've used it a couple of weeks.I purchased this camera, two batteries and the SanDisk Ultra 32G card.  The camera arrived a day early and the other two on time.  Since I could do nothing until the card arrived I charged the battery and read the manual.  The next day I inserted the card and synched the remote.  I also downloaded the latest software update from the Go-Pro site and following their instructions to the letter I put the card back in, turned on the camera and waited for the update.Two hours later I was still waiting.  Lights were flashing, the indicator said updating was in progreess, etc.  But something was wrong so I called Go-Pro and talked to a tech.  He confirmed it should have taken a minute or two...tops.  So I pulled out the battery, pressed the On button and \"select\" button simultaneously and held them for 4 seconds.  Downloaded the update again except this time I manually created an UPDATE folder and after unzipping the downloaded file, put the 4 files in the folder.  Then I took the card out of the camera, re-formatted it and put the UPDATE folder on it.Back into the camera with battery and card, pressed the ON switch and ....nothing.  Literally.  This time no lights or anything.The tech recommended trying another microSD card but the only one I remembered having was an older version that, whereas would not have worked on the camera for filming, etc. since it was not fast or big enough, worked OK to upload the files.  Back into the camera, switched t on and BINGO!  It worked.Put the Sandisk card back in there and got an error message.  Turns out the Sandisk card was bad...for this camera. The tech mentioned they've been having lots of problems with those cards and recommended a different brand (can't remember now.)  The reason I don't is because I forgot I had another SanDisk 32G card in my tablet.  Out of curiosity I installed it and it worked!Here's the weird thing:  the card that did not work in the camera?  Works perfectly fine in my tablet now.  Go figure!!So was it the camera that's too finicky?  Can't seem to be the card as it works in other equipment.I haven't played much with the camera (it's raining cats and dogs) but the Android app works great.  Beats that tiny camera screen.  All the other features seem to work OK too for the little I tried it indoors.  Family's coming for Easter so I will be taking it kayaking and hope to grab underwater shots of manatees.  Will also play with the panorama-on-a-kitchen-timer trick.UPDATE:As promised here's the update.  I've upgraded to 5 stars as the SD card thing is more of a fluke than anything else.I'm very impressed by this camera. Took it swimming (buy a cheap monopod at Wal-Mart, hook it up, tie a string to the monopod and fling it in the water.  It floats lens down for unassisted filming.)

Which means, and Ive tried it out, that you can interchange cases. If youd like to accessorize your 3+ with cheaper options that are marketed for the 3 you can, or if you prefer the smaller lighter cases for the 3+ you could use them with your 3. Everything fits and lines up the same.  The 3+ cases are just smaller, thinner, lighter. And they do have a simpler latching system. Instead of the push to the side and pull back simultaneously and bash your fingers the first few times you use it  until you master it. They have a simple common latch. Super spendy though.

The image quality is very good - but this one seems to focus closer - objects beyond 5 ft are less sharp. There are a lot less issues using this than with the Hero3 when it was first released, out of the box.GoPro claimed that they've reduced the side, and increased battery life. They also claimed to have made it sharper. This is somewhat accurate. Let's examine the claims.Reduced size : the size reduction is from a smaller case. The camera is the exact same size. The new case is smaller and less tricky to open. The downside of that is that it is not rated for as deep in water as the old case. You can, however, use the old case if you happen to have one. Since the camera is the exact same size, there are no issues using the old case.The new case has another different issue : the backdoor for the battery pack or LCD screen will not fit the new case. GoPro appears to be working around this issue by shipping the old case with the battery back pack and LCD screen.If you have filters that clip on to the outside of the case, you're out of luck. The size is different, so filters (usually macro, polarizing, and red / magenta filters for underwater use) will no longer fit. The old cover for the housing will not fit the new housing. You will need to get the new version of the caps and doors, which adds a transparent glass cover for the lens, and costs twice what the old one costs.Better battery life : I tested this by running a test with both the old and new camera, at 1080p and ProTune. The old one died after about 1:35 and the new one went on till slightly over 2 hours. I then swapped batteries (they're interchangeable) and tested. The increased life comes from both a slightly larger battery (10% improvement) and a more efficient design (20% improvement). The camera still feels quite warm when in use.Sharper : close image appears to be sharper. Beyond 5 ft, it is less sharp, and beyond 20 ft the difference is quite pronounced. This has generated a lot of unhappiness among those who fly the GoPro on drones. The effect is also more pronounced when it is not sunny, and when shooting at a higher frame rate (smaller aperture when there is more light = greater depth of field). In the forums, many of the drone flyers have switched back to the older Hero3.Some users in the forums have reported that they are sending back their camera to GoPro for adjustment. Some reported improvements, other reported no change. As GoPro has not made an official announcement, I don't know if the closer focus is by design or a manufacturing issue. A few brave users have taken apart their camera to adjust focus, but I definitely do not advise taking that route. Best case : voided warranty. Worst case : dead camera without warranty,I've also noticed that the photos produced by the 3+ is half the size of the 3. GoPro is addressing this with a firmware update that \"fixes a bug which could cause over-compression of photo files\".Wifi performance may have been improved, but I did not test that extensively. Preview video lag is about 1 second, which is an improvement over the Hero3.One additional mode is added. It records more vertical resolution to get more of the scene in view. It appears to do this by recording in 1440 lines, then compresses this to 1080 lines. Aspect ratio is a little messed up as a result, but you do get a better view of, say, someone standing. If you don't mind doing post processing, you may want to record in a higher resolution (either 2.7k or 1440p) and do the compression yourself, or crop, as needed.In conclusion, the only question about this camera is the close focus. If that is not an issue to you, or if GoPro fixes this subsequently, it'll be a 5 star product. The older Hero3 has a shorter battery life, but is also $70 less expensive, which makes it a very compelling value in my opinion.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Horrid camera for diving, choose another.", "Author": "Ashley Lout", "ReviewID": "R2I570K7NAJE5D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So I got the Hero3+ for a dive trip in Belize. It was an easy use device and the first dive went without a hitch. Understand you must remove it from the housing in order to charge it. So dive 2 I go to turn it on and notice it won't activate, then I notice a bubble inside the housing. The seal failed after 1 dive, it gives no warning and  go pro doesn't warranty it as they blame it on the user. The problem lies in the poor clip design puts pressure on the bottom of the housing first. The seal wears so poorly it will simply loosen where you can't use it. My end result was this is a $400, one use camera. It is NOT a good camera for diving, choose  another. btw- my max depth was 81 ft for those that think I exceeded the limits, it failed at 40ft.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent when it does not corrupt the videos!", "Author": "Brad Hutchinson", "ReviewID": "R19564KL6A32AJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Overall when this camera works correctly it is a remarkable piece of equipment.  My childhood was filmed using enormous VHS recording camcorders, followed by the VHS-C, and Mini DV all of which took horrible quality videos compared to something as tiny as the GoPro it is truly a huge technological wonder.  I use this camera primarily in 1080/60P narrow mode and do not like any of the wide angle fisheye looking modes.  Video quality is excellent for the size and when used in correct situations.  The GoPro is made for action and use in places where you would not risk using another camcorder in my opinion.  I would never mount my Panasonic HD camcorder underneath my car or take it underwater for instance but I do it with the GoPro rather frequently.  The underwater housing works well both underwater and to protect the camera from rocks and things when driving down the road.  One thing I wish they would offer on the next model is the ability to take the highest MP photos without it having to be the stupid wide angle mode.My reason for a negative review is that this camera consistently gives me corrupt videos.  Before you type me a smart comment saying the issue is my memory card and that I am an idiot read on.  I am well aware of the counterfeit memory cards causing problems that is not my issue.  I have multiple Sandisk Extreme Micro SD cards that I use with this camcorder which have all been purchased from reputable retailers and all pass testing with both H2testw and Flash Drive Tester with no errors whatsoever on read or write.  All of the memory cards work flawlessly in other devices I own as well.  Every time I use them in the GoPro however I get at least one corrupt video usually within the first 60 minutes of videos.  The videos transfer to the computer as mp4 they just have no thumbnail image and they are not playable.  I have tried transferring them using Adobe Premiere Elements 10, GoPro Studio, and simple dragging and dropping off the memory card onto the computer they are corrupt either way.  My GoPro has never been knocked off or stopped recording due to damage or battery life running out.  There is no message on the GoPro after recording saying it is fixing the video.  I have contacted GoPro support about the problem since the camcorder is less than 3 months old but they are useless.  All they will tell me is that the problem has to be the memory card and will not take the camcorder back or exchange it I have been going back and forth with them for a while now it is like talking to a wall.  At some point if I get a properly working camera I will revise my review but as of now due to the loss of numerous videos with no solution in sight this is not trustworthy enough of a device to recommend to anybody.

It has a super view. It shoots much better quality and clarity. The sound quality is much better and clearer than before because it cuts down on wind noise. It comes with a wireless remote and built in wireless to the camera. The case it comes in is much lighter and is waterproof up to greater depths compared to the 3. The case is also shock resistant and it's very durable. I've personally dropped mine from 8ft on to a hard floor and nothing happened to the camera or the case. I watched the video of the camera dropping and it was very clear and cool to watch. This camera all around is a very good camera. I've used it many times on my dirt bikes and it held up very well from the rocks, dirt and branches hitting it. The mounts keep the gopro stuck to the helmet very well. Through all the rocks and branches hitting it the sound quality is very good compared to some of the other cameras out there. I personally really like this gopro. I highly suggest this camera because it holds up to my expectations. It\u2019s easy to adjust the settings like the quality of the camera and the fps (frames per second) with the gopro app that you can get on android phones and apples products. You can also watch the videos right then and there on your phone or Ipad.

Its small, lightweight, and fast. There are tons of uses for this camera.I feel I should give some advice on it, because you probably already know that its a great camera.If you are using it for something other than skydiving or bungee jumping [basically anything that doesn't take 5 minutes], buy extra batteries. I have used mine at the zoo, birthday parties, family football games, road trips. The battery is roughly 2 hours 10 minutes recording at 1080.If you have wifi turned on battery times drops down significantly. ONLY TURN ON WIFI WHEN USING IT, turn it off once you stop using it.One big tip that people complain about is that you can't get a long time lapse. You CAN do an overnight time lapse with this camera if you have it plugged in, however, you must first turn the camera on, and then connect it to the charger. I don't know why, but if you plug it in and then try to charge it, it won't work.One great thing they got rid of from the hero 3 no plus, is that you don't have to connect it to your computer in order to use the mobile app. If you are using this for anything that is not water based [anything where you are willing to take out your phone] do NOT pay for the lcd backpac, and just download the go pro app. Turn on your cameras wifi, go to your phones wifi settings and use that to see what you are recording, AND what you have already recorded. Certain record settings will not allow this [superview, 1440, 2.7K, 4K]Not only will you be able to see what you are doing and have done, but you can use your phone as a remote that is much faster than the remote it comes with.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Outstanding first time accident and the camera survived.", "Author": "Chandler \"J.

It filmed until the low battery warning when it shut off. The next morning a spear fisherman found it, tried to work it and accidently got a few pics of him self. Once I got the camera back, it was dry, working and ready to go with a battery change and charge. The lens on the case is not scratched and the camera works great still.

Its everything GoPro promised.", "Author": "L. Copps", "ReviewID": "R2SDREE2HYKIGO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Last year I purchased a Hero3 Black and had nothing but problems with lockups, corrupted cards, and it ate my batteries like candy. So I returned it and waited for a redesign.  GoPro promised the Hero3+ Black was 30 percent sharper, longer battery life, and runs better.  After using it on my Sea Kayak and skiing, I can say they finally got it right and perfectly delivered on their promises.  Apparently, early adopters of the Hero3+ black have experienced problems with focus on objects greater than 4 feet away, but in my January 2014 camera, I can say this problem is no longer there, and it is stunningly sharp on objects near and far.  The mountains in the background of my shots show amazing detail.  On clear day clips, my friends were simply blown away by the sharpness and vivid rich colors.  GoPro could stand to make the white balance a little aggressive in flat light situations.  Last week I skied with my Hero3+ black in Utah and had the camera on most of the day, each day, with Wifi turned on.  I changed the battery at lunch and the camera would work pretty much the whole day with recording around 20-30 min of video at 1080p 60fps per day.  I still have 32 and 64 GB SanDisk ultra cards from my original Hero3 that did not seem to work well with the original Hero3, but work great in the Hero3+.  However, I would buy the Extreme or the Lexar 600x cards as GoPro recommends.  Preferably the Lexar given SanDisk's checkered past with GoPro.  The smaller case of the the Hero3+ feels like less camera strapped to your head.  During the day, I use 2 Wasabi 1200 mah batteries that come with an external charger to power it which seem to last all day.  I do not use the USB cable on the camera at all.  On my trip, the camera never locked up and worked well, responding much faster than my Hero3 ever did when it worked.  The remote is a must if you really want to use this camera effectively.  In a sea kayak you cannot reach the camera, and skiing, the camera is nearly impossible to operate properly with gloves on.  I always strap the remote to my wrist with a velcro wrist strap, available very cheap on Amazon and worth the small expense.  The GoPro App has been improved and lets you preview your shot with your smartphone and easily adjust all the camera settings.  However, the video lag is about 3-4 seconds in the preview, but it works adequately for aiming the camera.  The GoPro app also lets you replay your recordings on your phone with no noticeable time lag. I normally do not use the app since my environment is too hostile for a smartphone or my iPod Touch.  The remote is more than adequate for my times out.  The remote can also change all the settings, but cannot be used to preview or review recordings.  I use my kayaking videos to examine my kayak rolling and paddle techniques in the pool or in the Atlantic surf.

It must meet the specs on the GoPro website. It also must work (I purchased a 64gb card from Amazon with good reviews but was losing videos and still shots when the card was over 1/3 full. The card was tested with a free program called h2testw which showed bad sectors. I've had it too long to return it, so I'll purchase another one locally,  and I'll definitely test it before use).GoPro Studio 2 works well with shots taken with their camera, but not with a Cannon Powershot I also own. I end up exporting in Archive mode, then import into Windows Movie Maker to assemble my videos with the Powershot images included.To make the videos or stills \"pop\" increase the saturation to about 1.4  This makes colors brighter. To create black and white decrease the saturation to 0  To steal a still shot from a video, pause at the shot you want, make whatever changes you want such as saturation or zoom, then click \"file\" in the left upper corner, click \"export\", then click \"still\". It will ask you for a name and file time and then you're done. As a cyclist I use this so I can take a video over my head of a group of riders behind me. By moving the camera around, I'm likely to get a number of shots showing what I want to see.If you want to speed up or slow down a portion of a video, you can cut it into sections assigning different speeds to each section. You can also take a still at a cut and use it to install a pause in the action. Lots of fun stuff but time consuming.Don't think you can buy this camera for $400. You need a card, then of course you'll need mounts, maybe an LCD monitor for the back when you want to take stills, remote, extra batteries, etc.The GoPro website has a lot of help with great ideas and I cut & pasted a lot of text to make my own help file.Hope this review helps.

The battery life has improved so that you can record the highest setting with wifi on for about 90 mins. It goes up a bit from there but not too much longer. I would say two hours recording on most setting is the max you can get out of one battery. I highly recommend the Wasabi batteries and charger but the stock GoPro battery won't fit in the Wasabi charger, just a heads up. It is tough to keep the wifi remoto charged all the time as you can not change its battery and its easy to not know that it is on and run down its battery when not in use. For updates to the camera you have to copy firmware files to the microSD card then power on the camera with the card inserted and the updates will take effect. The older models used the GoPro Cinema 2.0 to do updates but not the Hero 3+. I also highly recommend the FRAME for this camera if not flying over water or in winds over 100mph as it is much lighter, great for flying deviced like the DJI F450, F550, S800 and Phantom for killer aerial video footage. This is what I use to film motorcycles and places I just can't reach by holding a camera. Check out my youtube at youtube.com/slrkappa for some videos I have shot with this GoPro Hero 3+ Black! I still have two of the Hero 2's and one orginal SD GoPro Hero camera and the 3+ Black is many times better, lighter and smaller by far! You can use this camera to film time lapse videos as I have done, underwater shots, slow motion HD video in 720 @120 frames per second and WVGA @ 240 FRAMES PER SECOND! How amazing is that for slow motion that fits in the palm of your hand? Make sure to get the Class 10 micro SD as well as the 64GB size if you can afford it.

The Hero3+ has great 12mp stills and my favorite feature is the time lapse (interval meter mode). A lot of people I know get this camera after I recommend it and then say they don't know what to use it for or how/when...  I just tell them to take it out and start recording, you can always delete.  Watch some Youtube videos and experiment.  Buy some extra batteries and go!I always have Hero Plus on me.  If the sunset is amazing, I will take some stills or set it up with the Jaws Clap mount and take a time lapse of the sunset or weather clouds rolling by for a quick dynamic video.  I also mount it in my car as a dash cam, maybe getting a video of something crazy that might happen.  We pull it out to take 30 pics/1 second stills in 30/1-mode at the baseball field if someone is hitting to see the progress of the hitters swing.  I also mount it on my surfboard with the surf mount and a floaty or hold the camera in my mouth biting the floaty as I take off on the wave for a great perspective.  I have mounted the camera to my helmet for snowboarding, mountain biking and paintball as well as drilling hole through the bill of my hat for wakeboarding and wake-skating.The remote is waterproof and works great.  The phone app is also awesome, just be aware of the fact that there is a little more battery drain.

The actually camera, when out of the housing has a protruding, convex front element (which allows for super wide angle shots) that could easily be fingerprinted or damaged while handling the camera to change batteries, changing memory cards, attaching cables, etc.  These cameras are so often used in active outdoor activities involving salt water and snow and I feel like the caps could benefit to keep crud off the lens while out of the housing.But, no worries, GoPro will sell you a package for about $19  that includes camera lens cap, a protective lens, extra doors and a cover that protects the lens port on the housing and simultaneously covers the power button to prevent accidentally turning the camera on.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Issue with mounts/buckles when upgrading", "Author": "T Dragon", "ReviewID": "R3251BE31BLPHH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far the camera works great but I found one issue if you are upgrading from an older GoPro.GoPro seem to have changed the specs for the mounts/buckles from the original GoPro Hero.My helmet already had mounts stuck to them from my GoPro Hero but the buckles from the Hero 3+ don't fit properly in these mounts, they are extremely tight and don't lock all the way in.

I used it to record what it was like to have a brew day, and my friend used it to go caving. It easily attaches to a helmet or your dash. My only complaints would be the sound isn't great. Maybe it was a software configuration to turn the mike up, but I didn't seem to get very loud sound. Also, the video was kind of fish-eye.  Cool when driving, but not as cool when you want to get a close up of something with a really clean shot. These are probably both settings, but be aware that if I couldn't easily figure it out, it may take some time to learn.Overall, I think it is a nice all around action camera.

Rose", "ReviewID": "R1W423KU5OPN6X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The HERO3+ series of GoPro cameras allegedly represent a step up from the HERO3 series in terms of battery life and wireless data transfer, as well as 'sharper' focus.The HERO3+ is a solid step up if you have a HERO or HERO2 camera, but probably not a major improvement for you if you're already working with a HERO3 (I recently reviewed a HERO3 Black edition camera and was blown away by its performance -- I experienced none of the firmware-related issues that are so common in the product reviews).A lot of people are complaining about the reconfiguration of the HERO3+ to a new, 'sharper' lens... perhaps it is indeed sharper at close range (selfie-shots from the nose of a surfboard, for instance), but many are saying it loses focus around the edges & at distances greater than a few meters. I've not noticed an appreciable improvement in 'sharpness' in my use -- I mount it at the nose of my shortboard, just like me HERO3 Black Edition, and film at 720p / 60fps... since my TV is 720p, anything higher would just be a waste of storage capacity on my card. I can't tell a difference in footage; both are crystal clear, like I'm watching a professional film. The people/waves in the background are too small to worry about anyway due to the wide angle of the HERO3 / HERO3+ lenses, so I think this problem only manifests if you're trying to use the HERO3+ to film landscapes or other people at distances of 4-10 meters (past that they'll be tiny anyway).I managed to burn through my battery in about 3.5 hours of on-off (mostly on) surfing footage and about 120 clips (most of them short, ~10 seconds). At the lowest settings, an hour of footage eats up about 8GB of storage space. Battery life might be somewhat improved over the HERO3 (WiFi turned OFF) but I managed to avoid the battery life issue altogether by snagging a couple extra batteries and a wall charger for about thirty bucks.The WiFi improvement doesn't concern me, as I don't use WiFi with my GoPro cameras... I strap them on my board and activate them manually, and do data transfer via the included mini-USB cable.I'm giving this camera 4 stars because the focus issue would seem to limit the applications for this camera to strictly \"selfie\" shots. This is a pretty major limiter when you're talking about a sports camera. Seeing as the HERO3 Silver Edition is ten percent cheaper and doesn't have this issue, you might be better off going with that one (or even the White edition) or just waiting for this issue to be addressed in the next generation of HERO cameras.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome -- best birthday gift I've had.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RW5HZDRSLNMBI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely love it!

To me there was no question about the quality or reliability, these things are great for years.  I wanted the ability to get HD 1080p vids at 30fps, but didn't have a reason to get the 60fps or the higher-res formats available in the Hero3+ Black.  Those really are great features if you need them, the video quality is amazing, but wasn't necessary for me personally.  One thing I learned about the White edition that i got is it has the ability to link to my iPhone (and other phones I'm sure but check the specs) and review videos or watch a live feed from the camera with only a few second delay, via a wifi connection using the GoPro app. I can also use the phone as a remote control for starting and stopping recording too, which for me makes having a separate remote unnecessary.  Mine came with both the watertight enclosure and the skeleton back if you want clearer sound and don't need the protection.

How disappointing.UPDATE 1/22/14It seems the GoPro 3+ is packaged with two different model cameras, one older and one newer along with newer software installed. The camera I originally bought said GoPro 3+ on the box and came with a note stating it needed to be updated prior to use. On the body of the camera itself, it stated only GoPro 3.  Since the camera was DOA I was never able to update it.  I stand by my review for that item.  However, I did exchange the unit for a model which is paged as a GoPro3+ and also states it on the camera body itself.  Does it appear GoPro was just trying to sell the GoPro 3 as a 3+ once you updated it?  I'm not sure but I can see the lens is different on the newer model and the feel seems somewhat more solid. The waterproof case is also a better locking design.  So far the newer, exchanged model is working just fine. Actually, really good. Integrated with my iPhone GoPro App well and the images look good.

No viewfinder, simple menu system, three buttons (power, wifi power and the typical 'snap a photo' button), no digital display, no flash.  Take it out of the waterproof case, and all you have is a tiny little camera that looks a bit like a toy.  They stripped it down to the bare minimum, but what the GoPro can do will blow your mind.  Or blow my mind anyway.By creating it's own local wi-fi network, you actually use your phone, or iPod as a viewfinder.  There is a little lag between what you're actually taping, and the display, but its a pretty neat revelation the first time you use it.  Very easy to connect and set up.  I'm no professional filmmaker or photographer, but I had it set up in less than 5 minutes.  Then I passed my phone or camera around a group of friends and everyone started cracking up, having fun watching and fun shooting.It comes with this weird bracket/screw thing on the bottom of the waterproof case.  I thought 'Well, this sucks.  You have unscrew all this junk to swap out mounts?'  I was wrong.  Yes, you unscrew this little knob to change mounts (there are many available - everything from headstraps to suction cups), but its only threaded in about 3 threads or so.  Only takes 4 turns to take the mount off ie. two seconds.  Very nice, simple, straightforward design.I bought a headstrap for the GoPro so I could film my twin babies at home.  Its hard to juggle them as it is, nevertheless trying to snap photos of video of them.  I stuck the camera on my head, and then took a video feeding both of them.  Probably not the intended use, most GoPro ads show them strapped to snowboards or BMX bikes, but it was a nice way to capture a memory of the babies before they grow up.My only big knock is that you MUST have a microSD card (not included) for the camera to use it at all.  So, I got the camera, then had to order a memory card.  They're cheap enough, but it would have been nice to include a small 4gb card to get your feet wet until you find something bigger to use.  There is an HDMI port and a USB adapter to hook it up to your computer or TV.Overall, what a cool gadget!  Just walking around my daily life, I thought of a million little events that would be fun to capture with the GoPro - everything from waking the babies up, to playing pinball, running around the yard, touring a pinball playfield in 'first person' mode, etc.  A must have gadget for the tech savvy.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cute, compact, good quality video", "Author": "FlamingoNut

Since it's not the season yet, I am testing it as a dash cam.  I initially mounted the first flat adhesive mount onto my dashboard, directly in front of the steering wheel.  Considering this camera is a wide screen, it just didn't work as planned.  After a few days, I used a hair dryer, I heated the mount, and after a few minutes, it easily removed from the dashboard without leaving any marks, stains, or residues.  I mounted another just in front of my cd drive, which is centered and at the top of the dashboard (2014 Ford Escape), and it does not interfere with putting in or removing a cd.  Much better; I now get almost the entire windshield view, but unfortunately, part of the dashboard as well.  Tilting the camera upright helps a bit, but makes for an odd video.  I tried to eliminate that by purchasing the GoPro Helmet Front Mount, but the video was extremely shaky & noisy, moreso than with using the standard mount that came with the camera.The menu is kind of confusing for a newbie, but after time, it's easy enough to figure out.  The still shots I did manage to take while driving, were pretty clear and nothing seemed out of focus.  But although I pressed the button quite a bit, it only managed to take a few shots, much less than I thought I took.  At one point, I kept pressing the button, only to have one jpg show up on the card.  The housing itself it kind of hard to open; I managed to break a few nails, but with time, I got the hang of it, even managing to snap it off, but eventually got it back on.  The seal seems tight, after about 20 openings/closings of the case.  I tested it the hot tub, and it was indeed watertight.  The daylight video itself was surprisingly grainy, something definitely not expected.Right off the bat, I installed at 16gb SD card, but that quickly filled up, after what seemed to be only a small amount of time.  So I purchased SanDisk Ultra 32 GB MicroSDHC C10/UHS1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A), and haven't had it fill up, but then again, I'm pretty good about offloading & freeing up space.  A long trip would require multiple cards for sure.I also purchased Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger for GoPro HD HERO3, HERO3+ and GoPro AHDBT-201, AHDBT-301, AHDBT-302, since the battery definitely needs recharging after a few hours.  The original battery that came with the camera didn't initially fit, but after some shoving, it fit & charged.  The replacement battery fits inside the camera perfectly.The one major issue I have is that I wish it had a LCD viewer on the back of the camera.  Whether using it as a dash cam or snorkeling, I'd like to see that I'm at least pointing it in the right direction, and not too high or too low or at an off centered angle.It takes a nice video and the coloring is beautiful, but I look forward to testing it out on the slopes.  I'm not sure what type of mount I will go with, most likely a chest harness, since I don't wear a helmet.EDIT:  Another small thing that bothers me is why it doesn't have a tripod mount built directly into the bottom of the camera?  Yes, I know there's an additional mount (GoPro Tripod Mount) that can be purchased that can be used when using the case, but what if you just want to use the standalone camera without the case?  It certainly couldn't have hurt to put one on the camera itself.", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Has some cool new features, and some dumb new features.", "Author": "Hunter Byron", "ReviewID": "R2YHNBN60QY75G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Hero3+ has a sleeker look than the more rugged looking Hero3. Both are great cameras, but as stated in other reviews there are some drawbacks. I recently did a shoot where both the Hero3 and Hero3+ were used. The coloring of the 3+ seemed much better and easier to work with when matching it with the DSLRS also used in the shoot. The Hero3+ has a noticeably longer battery life and was mounted to the handlebars of a Harley, while the Hero3 was mounted on a DJI Phantom. Both cameras performed quite well, the Hero3 got some amazing aerial footage of the mountains the ride was on. While the Hero3+ provided extremely smooth footage and really brought out the detail in the road and closeup scenery. Luckily the ride was full of switchbacks so there weren't many areas for the Hero3+ to look soft and out of focus. The wifi ability is a big improvement over the Hero3 and is definitely appreciated. My biggest complaint about the Hero3+ is that the case is junk compared to the Hero3. Mine came with a gash in the white rubber gasket and the latch broke off the third time using it. I wouldn't say I would want one over the other, but the Hero3+ was somewhat disappointing.

First, this GoPro camera is super light, does GREAT HD photography and video, and is solid as a bug. But if you're interested in hoisting this on a kite's line (me) it has a single fatal flaw. The inability to set for infinite focus is a deal breaker. It's not that this is bad or wrong, it has to do with the specs of this specific camera. For anything that doesn't require that your field of vision is out in the distance (i.e., suspended from a kite or balloon and shooting landscape far away) this is a typical GoPro stud camera in lightness, durability, etc.I use cheapo Canon SureShots for my KAP and they do a yeoman job. The GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition does everything super awesome EXCEPT for the infinite focus I need for my kite photography. I would give this a full 5 out of 5 stars if this lack of feature were made clear, but a great camera for almost everything else I have to dock one star for what I need.Caveat: I've been reading the GoPro bulletin boards and I'm still not sure if this is something that can be cured by a firmware update (or a legal hack).

I really don't care much for this camera for a number of reasons. The menu system is a nightmare. I still have to get the manual out---I have several high end digital cameras with exotic features and never need the manuals. So if you want easy, forget this thing.The most important thing a camera does is capture images and video. Here is a mixed bag. The quality if the video can be stunningly great. But the lens, designed for the ultimate selfie, is so wide that everything is shaped like a banana. That's ok, sort of. You expect novelty from a novelty camera. But I wish I could fit this camera with a lens that did not have such severe fish-eye. So you get beautiful video through the bottom of a bottle.Yes, it's small. Great if you are going to skydive and film it. For the other 99.999999% of your life, the camera is a mess to use. Turn on, start? No, menu? Stills? What 50 stills? 1 still? No, video...is it on? Can you actually turn this thing on without smudging the lens? No. It's very cumbersome to use.To retrieve images is a nightmare. Connect via usb, give it a LONG time to download OR gently fetch out the micro little memory card, put it in an adapter and then download that to your computer. I'm spoiled with pull the SD card, insert in computer, copy files I want, delete the rest. Card back in camera. If you attach by USB, you cannot delete anything on the bloody card after the lengthy process of copying to your computer. They have it protected. You have to use the bloody menu to find the trash can to delete the files which mandates another trip through menu hell.I received the 'best' unit. BUT! I never got the remote to work. I never got the app to work and I tried three tablets and a phone. Yes, I was easily able to perform the upgrade of the firmware. But the remote? Nope. Apps? Nope. So much of the money spent is wasted there. I wish it didn't have WiFi. That's something that doesn't work and if accidentally activated, drains the battery. The battery life is short as is. Which means extracting the thing from the plastic case to get at the battery, etc, etc.In all, I really don't care for this camera. I never grab it when heading out for a walk with the hounds in the woods. I mean, curved videos of my feet isn't that interesting.If you are a sports person, you might get some fun out of this thing. But for the rest of us, it's an over-priced toy that is too much bother to use. This is especially true because the high end features which could make this camera worth the trouble do not easily work. I'm sure if I had a couple hours to spend on the phone, support could resolve the WiFi issue. I just don't have the time so the whole kit is in a box in the closet waiting for me to get the time.Next year I want a good weather station please.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "My First GoPro Camera", "Author": "Born to Shop!", "ReviewID": "R3SNR80C724F0F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my first GoPro camera. We shoot lots of videos of fishing, hunting and family vacations that include snorkeling, boating, etc. Besides capturing memories to share and remember, we post a lot of fishing videos on our YouTube channel.We had the opportunity to test the GoPro 3+ Silver Edition on a recent Salmon fishing trip. We were extremely impressed on how tiny and lightweight it is. Overall battery life is decent, but I would highly recommend purchasing additional batteries to keep on hand to change out. On the average the battery lasted approximately 1.5 to 2 hours with sporadic shooting. In regards to the video quality the colors are so beautiful and crisp, but sometimes the videos comes out of focus when it comes to long distance shots. Upclose videos and stills they are impressive, they look like you are in the picture. However I noticed it most everything had a fish-eye effect which was a bit disappointing.I was extremely impressed how the audio is able to pick up so much for having such a small microphone. The housing is quite a protective shell I must say. It snaps tightly in place. You can exactly hear air escaping when you open it up!Connecting to the WiFi app was a bit tricky and it took me sometime to understand. The instructions in the manual were quite confusing. What it does not explain is that after installing the GoPro app, you need to go to your cellphone's \"settings\" menu and connect to GoPro Wireless Network (using password \"goprohero\") after turning it on by hitting the WiFi button twice on the camera. It is kind of the same procedure like connecting your phone to a Bluetooth device. After connecting to the GoPro network, you then have to open the GoPro app and rename the network and password and go back to your phone's setting and reconnect under the new network name. It took me a while to figure this out, but I finally connected to the WiFi app on my iPhone 5S. And what an amazing app it is. From my phone I can control everything. I can adjust the camera's image settings such as resolution, frame rate, field of view, etc. I can chose to record videos, take stills, burst shots and even timed lapsed stills. You can see the battery status and even view all your videos on the SD card and delete the ones you don't want.

The remote and phone apps were both triggering records or pictures as expected, the battery lasted about as long as I would have hoped, and the accessories made this device truly awesome.Things went downhill from there. When I got home to review the videos, I found that they  have a feature that cuts videos up into sections. Which at first didn't seem like much of a problem. However what I found was that every second section of a video recording would not play. I would get a black screen with no audio. I searched the web up and down to figure out what was going on. Apparently this is a normal problem, usually due to cheaper/slower SD cards. However I checked and double checked to make sure the SD card I had was compatible and it was.I eventually tried 3 different solutions on how to recover the video. From what people were saying online, the only thing that was missing was the file headers for the avi files it generates. The files were 2+ gigs each, so I know the video was there.

The still photo resolution is 12MP with improved barrel distortion and a new SuperView mode provides better widescreen images vs a more fisheye look without post processing.WiFi signal strength is much better in my tests with faster downloads of images and movies to the smartphone app and less latency in preview mode.The combination of a higher capacity battery and reported software improvements increased battery life from about 1.5 hours to 2 hours of video. However I still was unable to get much longer time lapse than just shooting straight video. One downside of the new battery is a physical change that removed a couple small indents on the back side upper corners. While the new and old batteries work equally well in either the Hero3 or Hero3+, the new battery will not fit in my 3rd party Wasabi power external charger.The overall specs for the 3+ indicate the camera is 20% smaller and lighter. The camera itself is imperceptibly lighter, 2 grams at most, The changes are mostly to the case which is indeed much smaller and lighter. Internal measurements for the case are significantly smaller. So much so that the 3+ case external dimensions are smaller than the internal dimensions of the 3 case. However the change only removes unused space and both the 3 and 3+ cameras fit equally as well in either case with new new tighter fit being much more stable without the need to use any additional DIY anti rattle steps.The latching mechanism is much easier to operate and removes the secure lock which takes intentional and specific maneuvering to operate. While it is theoretically possible for the new latch to snag on something and open, in real world operation I don't think this is a significant concern.Buttons are wider, shorter, and much easier to operate and the 6 external screws holding the lens cover have been replaced with 4 internal screws.Underwater specs are not quite as good with the new case specs indicating 40m safety under the previous 60m spec, still plenty of safety margin for most use but if water intrusion is a major concern you can pick up the old style case if you don't already have it.While the Hero 3 Black edition made significant improvements to the audio quality over previous models, the Hero 3+ Black edition again steps up the quality of the audio again with much fuller full spectrum sound and clearer vocals.Slow mo can be achieved recording 240fps at WVGA, 120fps at 720, and 60fps at 1080.Firmware updates on the Hero3 could be achieved by plugging in the camera to a PC and navigating to the GoPro website which would auto detect the camera and pull the serial number for you. With the 3+ the USB connectivity seems to have been changed to read only so firmware upgrades require the user to enter in the serial number manually and download the firmware to a microSD card which you then install in the camera. This process is not difficult but I liked the fully automatic approach of the previous edition. I have read that the smartphone app is expected to add firmware update capability so this may be a short term issue.As with the Hero3, the smartphone app makes operation and feature setting super easy. Pull down menus, video preview and remote shutter operation make the GoPro a breeze to use through the free app with iOS or Android devices. Most images and video can be downloaded directly to the smartphone or tablet however some of the settings such as ProTune render the video preview inoperable while recording and remove the ability to download to your device.If you don't have a smartphone available or don't want to use it in the environment you are recording, the included remote fob gives you all the same capabilities on the camera itself including a mirror of the LCD screen so you can make any setting changes while the camera is out of reach or out of view.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "iPhone and Mac Software make

had to find another use for the camera.  The attached video review is a time lapse movie of the sunrise from the beach on Isle of Palms, SC November 17, 2013.  GoPro makes time lapse photography a breeze using the iPhone software to set up the camera and the GoPro Studio software to convert the images to a time lapse movie.For the best out of the box experience with the camera, download the smartphone software and install the GoPro Studio on your Mac or PC.  When bluetooth is activated on the camera it creates a WiFi network that you join with your phone.  Once connected to the GoPro WiFi, you can use your phone to make adjustments and choose still, video, or time lapse photography.  You can also use your phone as a viewfinder and frame your subject perfectly.For the attached time lapse movie, I set the \"field of view\" to \"medium\", \"Photo Resolution\" to \"5MP MED\", and the \"Time Lapse\" setting to \"1 SEC\".  Once setup was complete, I set the GoPro on a small tripod and pressed \"Record' from my phone and let it go for about half an hour from dawn to sunrise.I them removed the card from the camera and inserted it into the SD slot on the iMac and opened the GoPro Studio software.  The software immediately recognized the card and intuitively knows to import the images as frames of a movie.  The rest is very intuitive, from converting the images to a movie and then exporting to disc, Facebook, or Youtube.  It's just that simple.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "MUCH IMPROVED!!", "Author": "James Duckett", "ReviewID": "R3JNV6QI282CVA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the Hero Black Edition, and my biggest complaint was the battery.

Pretty much everything is better about it!  Starting with the new lens which helps the HERO3+ Black Edition produce much sharper video than before, with better, more lifelike color, better saturation, better contrast and truer white balance (say goodbye to the yellow cast!).  It also has better low light performance with better clarity and color accuracy than before at night and in light challenged situations.  The new microphones and audio system produce video with waaaay clearer, much more accurate and dynamic audio.  The HERO3+ Black Edition has about a 20~25% improved battery life/charge thanks to both a higher capacity battery and better power consumption.  The WIFI speed and range have been dramatically improved thanks to a new WIFI chip.  In my experience, I get a range increase of close to five times that of Hero3 Black Edition.  Even the waterproof case has been improved as it is about 20% smaller, with a much-easier-to-use latch system and much-easier-to-use buttons.  Additionally, the HERO3+ Black Edition has a new super wide angle mode called SuperView which gives you the widest viewing angles yet.  GoPro has really been listening to the user community and these improvements make an already great live-action camera even better!If you do pick one up, be certain to purchase a GOOD, FAST MicroSD card.  I highly recommend the Samsung 64GB Pro microSDXC(MB-MGCGB/AM) card.  I have had zero problems with it in my HERO3 or HERO3+.  I have had problems with SanDisk Ultra 64GB cards and cannot recommend them (I have friends who have also had issues with SanDisk Ultra cards in their GoPros).For those of you who are concerned about the talk of a \"focus issue\" with the HERO3+ Black Edition mentioned in some reviews, I suggest that you don't listen to the negative reviews without checking out the comment section of this review for links to direct head to head video comparisons of the HERO3+ Black Edition vs the HERO3 Black Edition (I can't post links in the main review).

Great pictures and videos right out of the box!  We had it down to 100' feet in the ocean with no problems and the clarity and color of the pics were twice as good as similar priced cameras.  Word to the wise though is that it uses micro SD cards so you will need a reader with you or a larger memory card that you can put the micro into to modify the photos on the card.  Luckily we found a memory card in Mexico to slide our micro SD into so we could move the photos from the card (trying to do this from the camera directly didn't work.  Perhaps it was the type of micro SD card we had too, not sure).  Anyway, you will not be disappointed with this!

In addition, it worked properly, even though ambient temperatures were around 50 degrees below zero (F).I am delighted with the camera, and I believe that it is the ultimate camera for High Altitude Ballooning.In the customer picture section above, you can see the picture that this camera took from the edge of space of the earth.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for the family sled rides", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R3MRUTU6D5EKFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome camera and very convenient for all sorts of family outings and action sports.

Price wise, Sony models are pretty reasonable, so I bought its AS10 to try it out. Initially, I like the video quality. It seemed crispy and the colors were vibrant. However, I quickly realized that the camera shape was a bit awkward to attach on things I like. So I bought this newer Gopro and now I am very satisfied with this little one. I was hesitant at first to buy this because I read some reviews about the blurred image quality on this + models. But then later, I also heard that they would fix this issue by updating the firmware. I trusted what the CEO said and went ahead and bought one black and one silver. After few test shootings, I reviewed the image qualities, and I was pleased and satisfied again. I didn\u2019t expect much of good printable quality photos from this, but I have to say the video clips were just wonderful. As expected, I went through the registration and updating process once I received the camera, and after that I did not notice any image quality issues. White balances were pretty accurate and prompt when the light source changed and the colors were as neutral as it should be. GoPro might not as vibrant as Sony\u2019s, but, personally, I prefer natural colors. Gopro claimed these + models have improved low light shooting, but in my opinion it\u2019s not that great because all these point and shoot tiny cameras have natural born limit on low light shooting (small sensor size). However, under the bright sunny daylight, I saw plenty of details in shadow area (highlights in the sky were blown away somewhat and needed a ND or polarizer filter to fix this)What I most like about this camera is the ability of mounting. There are so many mounting accessories; I can mount this camera on almost anything I can imagine. I might be late on this new trend of POV shooting in the era of selfies and mobile devices, but wow this camera really expanded my horizons because of the accessibility and the portability. Also, I think the people at GoPro were pretty smart keeping the original form factor and it\u2019s size when designed new versions. They only made the hard case smaller and lighter. I don\u2019t think the upgrade from the 3s were major, yet, lighter weight and longer battery life itself would benefit many casual users like myself.Overall, I love it. This is the one that I would keep shooting things to document what I love to do. My only regret is the fact that I had not tried this earlier (think about the Gopro company is ten years old, many people still probably don\u2019t know much about what this can do). I think the price is bit high considering the device specification, yet no other cameras have such an ability to do what this can do.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "I was very satisfied!", "Author": "Alexandre Soares Polido de Oliveira", "ReviewID": "RYH006D9HC7N7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is so amazing, I was very satisfied!

My wife purchased the Hero3+ Black Edition for me as a birthday gift and I have to say the upgrade is well worth the price.The fit and finish and size are definitely an improvement.  The buttons are more responsive and easier to push.  The menus on the camera are more intuitive and seem to make more sense, its just all around better from that perspective.  The leds on the front and top make easier to tell when its recording from more angles than just the front.Throw in the remote and and it adds a whole new level of control.  Using the quick start instructions pairing the camera and the remote was a snap.  No more taking the camera on and off, removing a helmet or chest harness or handle bars.  Just pair the remote and you are good to go.The best feature in my opinion is the cell phone app.  Again, following the instructions in quick start guide makes connecting the phone a piece of cake and once they are connected you have full control and quick access to all the settings even down to turning off the LEDs and beep feedback.  Best of all is the ability to stream real time video directly to your phone so you can get your camera setup just right.  On the original this feature wasn't available without purchasing additional hardware and I can't tell you how many hours of video I have wasted over the years due to poor setup from the start.  The app also allows you to download your videos and photos directly to your phone so you can share them almost instantly.I ordered a case, a wrist strap for the remote and additional batteries with a quick charger.

I was also a little disappointed to find that there is no built in feature for mounting the camera to a standard tripod mount. Lens caps and tripod adapters are available either through GoPro or off-brand services.I happen to have access to both Andriod and iOS devices for preview, live view, and playback. For anyone who does not have such devices on hand, you'll need some way to monitor your camera such as a BacPac if you have plans to film shots more complicated than strapping the camera to a helmet or leaving it in a fixed position. The super wide angle, naturally, offers some compensation for this.Speaking of the wide angle, I'm personally not too keen on the distortion it creates, so I was delighted to find that certain recording resolutions do offer narrower fields of view.Overall, an amazing piece of hardware for someone on a minimal to medium budget.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "My son Loves it", "Author": "Mark S.

Personally, I think the Silver version provides 85% of the benefit most people will need from their Go Pro, but if you are super serious about this stuff maybe go for Black for advanced settings and higher res settings.  Everyone else, save the cash - this thing rocks.First, upgrading firmware, software is pretty easy if you have basic computer skills - dont be nervous - follow website/Amazon review instructions and it will be easy, as will be wireless setup.  Go Pro App is sweet - can control camera, preview, review footage all immediately on phone through wireless.  Be aware though - wireless range is pretty limited - not sure but Go Pro wireless remote might have longer range - seems to based on advertising.  We used this for trip to Dominican Republic, primarily for snorkeling, but also general photos and vids.  Default 960p/60 fps (think its 60 fps) vid (can go to 1080p too) is awesome and the camera does pretty well in low light - adjusts quick - I placed the camera several times under a coral outcrop (get the clear Go Pole - must have accessory) and in seconds it adjusted and captured great footage.  Def does better closer to object than far away in regards to detail, but as long as you dont expect super zoom type of detail, it will meet your needs.  As others have noted, lens does impart somewhat of a fish eye type of effect, but nothing that made me terribly upset.  10mp pics came out nice - once again, closer to subject better.  Time lapse and burst are awesome for catching the perfect shot in a dynamic situation.  Housing is well made and camera and housing are durable.  No problem down to 25 feet snorkeling and rated to like 90+.  Antifog inserts a must for underwater or humid conditions.  Battery life was excellent - I found myself able to have the camera on and filming on and off for at least an hour and then be able to review footage on phone through wireless for at least 30 min before battery gave out - get Wasabi backups and charger - seems to work just fine with Go Pro battery - charging through USB is a pain to me.  Would also be nice to be able to effectively transfer stuff to PC through wireless, but at size of vids and pics easier to just remove from housing and do through USB.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "good price", "Author": "Barbara J.

Basically, you pop in a micro SD card (not included), download an app for you phone, and you can start transferring photos and controlling the camera with the app (iOS, Android or Windows Mobile), which connects to the HERO3+ as if it were a WiFi hotspot.You see a live video feed (delayed by a second or two) right in the app, and there are controls to transfer and otherwise manage photos and video.The first video I shot was actually in my basement in low light, and the picture and audio came out smooth, detailed and crystal clear! The wide angle lens allows a good view of whatever you're filming (or interesting close ups) and there are modes for camera, burst camera or video.It all comes in a waterproof case (which must be removed for charging) that is supposed to be submersible up to 131 feet!This is a gadget that is hard not to geek out about. It's truly awesome and (I dare say) fun to use!The main drawback is that it all but requires you buy accessories.

But for equipment that costs over $300 I definitely expected more. And should've done a lot more research.Yes, yes, with the proper casing you can use it underwater. Guess what, with proper casing you can even use your iPhone under water. Or even your camera. And you wouldn't have to buy yet another camera that you'd have to charge (when it charges). One more thing I HATE about it - I had to buy a card reader in order to view my content! Every device I use nowadays is recognized by my Mac/PC/whatever when I plug it in via USB. NOT GOPRO. So the only way to get your content with GoPro is to PURCHASE a MicroSD card and then PUCHASE a card reader. A whole lot of waste of money for a crappy product.

This is astounding for such a popular,  and pricey,  device.  At this point I cannot tell whether or not it is the card,  the camera,  or both.  I will update this review after I get another card  (NOT San Disk),  and I update the firmware.  Go Pro should put a note in all the cameras  \"Update  Firmware\".

I have read about the poor distance focusing,  but I can't even write about this,  because the camera only gives an error message  (\"No Disk\").  I wanted to hike and ski tomorrow,  but I first have to get a new card;  download firmware, and hope i works.Also:  The remote on this unit has a bizarre feature.  When it is finished charging,  it turns itself on,  and then stops charging.  So if you plug it in,  and charge it overnight,  it is uncharged in the morning.  This is fantastically stupid!  I spoke to tech support,  and they politely told me that they have been informed of this glitch..So what to do?

I'm not an extreme sports person, but I used it in trees in my yard to remotely capture hummingbirds and other wildlife.  It's small and unobtrusive, so the animals don't know it's there.  Using the mobile app with it (as a remote) is really cool and allows you to start and stop the camera whenever you need to - without taking it out of it's housing.I did run into some overheating issues with it here in Arizona - when filming inside it's case in the sun, it barely made it 20-30 minutes without shutting down due to heat.  I can imagine this would be a pain when hiking in the sun or in hotter locations in the summer.  However, after a brief rest, the camera was ready to go again.The button that works the controls needs to be simplified - I understand they were trying to make it have as few openings on the body as possible, but having several buttons (an OK button) or a wheel would make selecting options so much easier.  I found it frustrating to cycle through the menus with one button and select with the other - then when in the next menu you'd have to remember which button did what again.

In this case, after camera is unplugged, the only way to turn it off is to physically remove the battery.

Then, they advised me to format microSD card using camera itself every time after I connect to PC (!!!). Although this procedure sounds very strange, mildly speaking, I nevertheless tried it - again, with no positive result. So, the only way to transfer the data from this camera is via actual insert of microSD into PC.And here comes another problem. When I use this camera as a dash cam, the so-called \"naked frame\", which is the most suitable for that type of application, has an opening only enough to attach/remove USB cable, but not the card. In order to make the card removable without taking off the frame, I had to enlarge the opening using small file. Certainly, this is not a big deal, but I wonder why camera designers did not foresee such an elementary thing that at some point of time the microSD card should be taken out?On the positive side, I can give a credit for video/photo quality - these are acceptable for me.

It won't be my last!Since I haven't had much experience with them in the past, I asked a friend if I could see his GoPro 2 to offer some comparison. Here's a quick rundown of differences between the second series and the GoPro 3+:- So much slimmer! The GP2 is about 1 3/8\" thick (inc. lens) and the GP3+ is 1 1/8\" thick (inc. lens).- Bigger buttons on the GP3+, so easier to operate, especially if you have bigger fingers.- The GP2 uses SD cards, and the GP3+ micro SD.- Battery life is far superior on the GP3+. Though I have not yet run through a complete cycle (since plugging it into the computer seems to be charging it too), the GP3+ battery has never run low yet, and anecdotally, my friend said the GP2 battery didn't have the same lasting power.Picture quality is incredible. The HD video won't even play smoothly on my older computer (time for a new computer, it would seem) and that is not even at the best resolution. On a newer computer, the videos are super high-quality and I am in awe by the clarity and color.The wide-angle lens is perfect for all of your adventures. Image stabilization is also superb. And surprisingly good sound, even from within the protective case.The display on the camera still suffers the same simplicity (read: a little hard to use) as the GP2, but it doesn't take long to figure out how to move through it and make your selections.But here is where the 3+ (black edition) rocks. GoPro has an app you can install on your phone or tablet, and not only does that turn your mobile device into a remote, it is also a preview screen and a way to easily go through the menu like any other app. Five stars for that alone! Connecting is very easy too.The remote that comes with it is also handy so you don't have to mess with the camera once it's mounted in place, and much easier to carry on your adventure than an iPad. :)The photo/video features are really cool. I have so far only played with the regular video mode and the 30 shots/sec option. That is pretty darn cool. Once I have a computer that has the computing power to process the files, I will be installing the GoPro editing software to make cool things happen.I still have a lot of adventuring to do with this camera, but so far it gets two thumbs up!

I don't have the previous 3 non plus version, but I am very happy with the photo results of the silver 3+ and decided to do some tests and to answer some common questions based on these tests. As a comparison I used an older Canon XTI camera which has an identical resolution 10mp (although much larger physically) sensor. For those that want a quick summary, the GoPro 3+ Silver appears to have its optimum focus point at about 5ft. By about 15ft you cannot distinguish anything smaller than about \u00bc inch. I was going to post comparison photos which I took of a 150 ft long concrete gravel driveway but it looks like the on again off again policy of posting user images is off again. Suffice it to say you could tell exactly where the best focus is by looking at where the pebbles are the sharpest. Other photographer oriented comments; In EXIF the camera reports itself as a 2.77mm f2.8 lens with a 16mm equivalent 35mm focal length. In all the light conditions I used it, it tried to keep the ISO at 100, but indoors it jumped up to ISO 350 and 1/6 sec. In bright sun I got exposures as short as 1/3425 second which is very quick.The comparison lens I used on the Canon was a 10mm (at f5.6 to attempt to compensate for the larger sensor and to get more comparable depth of field) which also has a 16mm equivalent in 35m world. I found the angle of coverage of the GoPro to be slightly better than 16mm though, I would estimate more like 14mm. When I focused the Canon manually to ~5ft is where the details and sharpness of the two cameras was most comparable. Shooting the perfectly gray concrete in bright sunlight the GoPro color balance was slightly on the green side. The sky comes out a spectacular blue, reds in flowers and green of grass seems muted. The manual on pg 32 describes that white balance can be accessed from the capture settings, yet my 1.07 firmware version did not have this option. Landscape photos were very well exposed, I did not have any blown highlights, however the contrast does appear to be on the high side.In my test photos I did confirm that the compression algorithm seems to smear a lot of details, especially when you go beyond the ~10ft distance, yet surprisingly the photos averaged 4.5MB (EXIF reported 2.4-3.5 BPP compression), while the Canon 10mp photos (med quality) were averaging 2.3MB. At the same the smaller file size Canon photos retained significantly more detail at 20+ft distances. One amazing observation, the Silver 3+ had very little to no chromatic aberation or purple fringinging in high contrast areas, it was much better than the Canon with the 10-22mm lens.The GoPro App for WiFi (android version) worked really well although at times I had to start it up twice when it said preview mode not supported. Outdoors I got an incredible 180ft range with it. Preview is only slightly choppy, maybe half second delay when you move. Note that the camera runs appreciably warm but not hot when the WiFi is enabled.Overall I had a blast with the camera. I would have preferred slightly longer optimum focus distance, settable compression quality, backlight on the lcd, and white balance that truly appears in the menu. Finally if you are on the fence between the Black and the Silver, if I had to do it again I would definitively go for the Black. Unless all you shoot is 1080P60FPS there is not enough a price difference to give up the extra resolution and burst speed.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "I LOVE IT", "Author": "laura", "ReviewID": "R4JY903DXF5UO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I LOVE IT but I just don't love that we have to buy all of this accesories for it to great (all of this mounts, lcd monitor, extra batteries, chargers, lens protector, microsd, etc.) And also, that if you left the battery in it, even though the camera is off, it will be consumed.

B+ for that!The Menus remain a minor nuisance to learn and navigate, but are consistent and dependable.  B for that.The Wifi performance to Phone or Tablet is awesome for viewing high def playback, or (almost) live viewing.  A+ for that!The Sound quality is improved, and is less compromised (but still diminished) when waterproof case is used.  B+ for that!The camera still cannot be externally powered while in the waterproof case (desirable for time lapse).  C for that.The GoPro apps for tablet and phone are good, but not awesome.  B+ for that!The GoPro Studio app for editing is good, but not intuitive. And hey, it's free! B+ for that!The mounts included are a good selection, very secure, and others are readily available.

As stated in the description, it is an f 2.8-6.0 lens that the new go pro uses. For those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about, here's what it means: Those numbers are whats called an aperture. That is a set of elements within the lens to determine how much light goes to the sensor. With a camera such as this, the changes to aperture occur as the lighting conditions change, unlike a DSLR where you control that manually. The change I'm talking about is the aperture opening and closing. At f/2.8, The depth of field, or amount of focus in your image is much smaller than at f/6. When the scene is super bright, your aperture will automatically be set at f/2.8, when its a bit darker perhaps f/6. So why does all of that matter? Some of you have reported that while you focus on something close, such as handlebars, your background has gone blurry ( thats called bokeh, its actually considered artistic). It's all about where you place the focus of your video which uncontrollably is related to how much light enters your scene. If you go into the settings of your go pro, you'll find a shooting setting called spot meter, that will allow you to select how much light enters your frame by focusing on one specific spot of your frame.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for underwater camera", "Author": "Pikmin", "ReviewID": "R3SWU2QUSDJTP2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "<!--\n\nfunction

Video quality is better than point-and-shoot underwater camera (Canon Powershot D10) thanks to high resolution (960p) video. The auto focus works fine capturing faraway objects but it can't capture object too close.I had an issue getting the camera firmware. My serial number has plus sign (+) but the website didn't accept my serial number (it kept saying invalid number). Finally I managed to download the firmware by entering a serial number I found at YouTube. I had another issue when copying the firmware to the microSD. Windows 8 reported that the removable drive is read-only.My advice regarding firmware update: you did not need to USB-connect the camera with your computer. Put your microSD into an adapter and insert it into your computer. Unzip the firmware and copy the files into the root directory of the microSD. Insert the microSD back to the camera. Restart the camera and it would automatically update itself.I downloaded GoPro Studio 2.0 Video Editing software for Windows 7. The software lacks common features I found in Windows Live Movie Maker or Sony Vegas Movie Editing. I could not recommend the video editing software.About my video review: the original video format recorded by GoPro Hero3+ was MP4, 1280 x 960, 59 frames/sec, bitrate about 14,993 kbps. I edited the video using Windows Live Movie Maker for Windows 7 and encoded it as WMV 1280 x 720, 4,000 kbps. Amazon might convert it to different resolution and bitrate. As a result, the video clarity you see in my review did not represent the original video from GoPro.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "diapporinting", "Author": "Robin Hyatt", "ReviewID": "RRGR6Y7001QMJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Too expensive for what you get.

We highly suggest investing in the remote accessory - it was a bit annoying to keep readjusting the unapod to restart the camera, and in the sunlight it was a bit hard to see the camera display.

With the Hero3+ we have not had those issues so far, been using in a month now and noticeably cooler weather then the summer use of the Hero 3. I love the wide view, beautiful better than life video quality; can even make the mighty Mississippi mud water look good enough to swim in. I find the app delay almost the same as the Hero3 maybe a half second shaved off, yet its still a great thing to be able to go on the Iphone or Ipad and change settings, preview video or watch what you already have, even transfer over and email clips.I much prefer the new lock latch over the Hero 3 two-step latch. Came with a slightly bigger battery, I don\u2019t mean physical size but is 1,180 mAh. A lot of our pre owned accessories work; I am adding the quick clip, and the standard tripod mount, got both for less than thirty on Amazon.  If I were to get to change anything, I would go back to the slightly bigger body and put in a longer life battery because battery life still sucks.When I am kayaking I forget to check and have lost over half my rides.

And, unfortunately, the weather hasn't cooperated in terms of field testing. Apologies aside, this is one slick little device. As someone who likes to take control of the photographic process, the GoPro HERO3+ Black has some great options in terms of remote control. The camera settings can be changed using the camera's 3 buttons but it also includes a small rechargeable keyfob style WiFi remote that lets you change all the settings, shoot photos, start and stop video recording and, importantly check the current settings and status on the remote's small LCD screen. Even better, there's a smartphone app for it that gives you a great interface for remote control. In order to use a smartphone, you'll need to turn on the camera's battery-draining Wifi and set your smartphone to connect to the camera's password protected Wifi network. Using an Android Samsung Galaxy SIII, I could not only see the current settings and status but also monitor what the camera was seeing. The video you see on phone's screen lags by a second or two, however, so you'll need to anticipate any still shots and use burst mode. With the smartphone app, you can also view, download and delete previously recorded videos and stills, a very nice feature.The camera, waterproof case and remote seem very well-made. As for the kit, it would have been nice if the camera had included a clamping mount instead of two different types of stick-on mounts. The package sadly also does not come with a micro-HDMI cable or adapter to view video and images on your HD TV. There are two USB cables for charging the remote and camera and to access to video and photo files as well as a Quick Setup guide and full manual. GoPro recommends a class 10 micro-SD card for the HERO3+, also not included.During hands-on testing, video looked very smooth with pretty good quality on a laptop screen. Stills were also pretty good once I switched on Auto White Balance. Switching to the smartphone app remote was a bit frustrating at first since it takes more than simply running the app to connect to the camera. I hope to test HD and ultra-HD video in more detail and post an update as time and weather permits.

I have talked to customer service and eventually (I'll spare you the long story) they eventually gave me the go ahead to send it back for them to look at. I haven't done that yet because at this point I have lost faith in their product and am fed up about all the time I have wasted on this but I need to do something soon as it's about to go out of warranty.When I am spending this kind of money I expect quality. The internet is full of tales of woe about this version of the GoPro. Anyway I'm going to have them fix it and probably sell it with full disclosure ( so at a considerable loss) along with all the accessories I bought and have never used because the camera has never worked.Next step for me is to look at the new Garmin unit. I've been a fan of their GPS and sports watches for a long time and the new camera is interoperable with other Garmin devices. Plus it doesn't look like it was built in the 60's.If I could give this zero stars I would.

Just reading some of the reviews for the 2012 Black Edition, there are a significant number of complaints about the GoPro overheating, locking up, or overall performing poorly. It seems that with the latest firmware update and/or an \"Extreme\" speed micro SD card (Such as the SanDisk Extreme or Samsung Pro microSDXC), the 2012 Black Edition works better. However, out of the box, the Hero3+ Black Edition works great.I never experienced any overheating, lockups, or other problems. I use a dedicated wall charger for charging the battery (Belkin 2A fast charge unit), and a Samsung Pro 64GB microSDXC that allows the GoPro to record at 45 Mbps bitrate w/ ProTune enabled. The battery life at 1080P/60fps, WiFi Remote On, Protune On = 1 hour 42 minutes. This isn't the most ideal battery life, but it is close to the runtime for my Hero3 Silver in 1080P/30 fps w/o ProTune.Reading some of the other reviews for the Hero3+ Black Edition, I noticed many complaining about the new optics not having true infinity focus. This is something I noticed as well, but I do not have the 2012 Black Edition to compare. I just figured it was the same for all GoPro models since my Hero3 Silver does the same thing, as does the Sony Action Cam. However, watching YouTube videos of side-by-side comparisons between the Hero3 Black and Hero3+ BLack, I personally couldn't tell much of a difference other than the Hero3 Black being a bit sharper and crisper when examining screen captures up close. The 2012 Black Edition was still blurry with distance shots, not even close to the videos my Samsung Galaxy S3 takes.I also learned that VLC Media Player (or another brand) is recommended for playing back videos recorded with the GoPro, mainly because Windows Media Player can't seem to handle the higher bitrate of the footage. I first encountered this problem with my Sony Action Cam with Firmware 2.0 which allowed 1080P 60fps footage. So I recommend downloading and using VLC media player for playback. A fast computer is also a good idea, because my Dell Core 2 Duo laptop from 2008 was incapable of smoothly playing back the 1080P 60fps video files. My desktop PC (AMD Phenom II X3 720 w/ Radeon HD 4850) was capable of playing back the videos and even editing them.The packaging is the same as last year's Hero3, which is a royal pain to open. But the Black Edition comes with some extra goodies, namely the WiFi remote control, a keyring for the remote, and charging cable for the remote. The display bracket for the remote was a pain to remove as well. The mount design is the same as previous GoPro models, and I always had issues with the mounts coming loose no matter how tight I turn the thumbscrew. In this instance, I did not have any problems. However, if it does loosen up, I recommend rosin (the stuff they use to secure rifle scopes in rings, or for gymnasts to increase grip) in the grooves.The Hero3+ still uses a mini-USB port for charging, which is interesting given that practically all smartphones, cameras, and tablets have adopted micro-USB as the new standard. The WiFi remote has its own charging cable with a proprietary attachment at the remote itself. When using the remote control, there is noticeable lag between control inputs and the display updates.The Hero3+ Black Edition comes with a slightly larger battery (1180 mAh vs. the older 1050 mAh), which is only a 12% increase in capacity. The other 18% improvement in battery life must have come from improved firmware/hardware. I observed a battery life of 1 hour 42 minutes with WiFi Remote Control, continuous recording, 1080P 60fps, and ProTune, which is actually very good. I remember with my Hero3 Silver that I was only able to get about 2 hours 10 minutes with 1080P 30fps without ProTune.I evaluated my Hero3+ Black Edition first with a SanDisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC card that is rated at Class 10 / UHS 1, but as well all know the SanDisk Ultra line is not on the GoPro recommended list for running the full 45 Mbps bitrate with ProTune.  I also used a Samsung Pro 64GB microSDXC card. That said, my Hero3+ Black Edition was stable with the SanDisk Ultra card (which only writes at around sequential 9 MB/s according to CrystalDiskMark) but I was limited to 35 Mbps bitrate in ProTune mode. I upgraded to a Samsung Pro 64GB microSDXC card that is on GoPro's list of recommended cards, mainly because it is half the price of the SanDisk Extreme microSDXC card and about the same price as the SanDisk Ultra 64GB card. The Samsung Pro writes at 15.62 MB/s in the same benchmark, and I was creating videos at 45-47 Mbps in ProTune mode in 1080P 60fps, 1440, 2.7k, and 4k modes. So the first thing I'd recommend is purchasing one of the SD cards on the GoPro recommended list just to have a faster card and ensure smooth operation of the GoPro.I had several complaints with last year's Hero3 editions. First, the microphone and audio recording was abysmal. I'd hear a distorted/crackling noise when recording inside a car that others have experienced and could never resolve. The audio always sounded muffled and poor. Watching any YouTube video or even professional videos on TV that used GoPros, I could easily tell that it was recorded using the built-in mic. However, the Hero3+ Black fixes all of these problems. I no longer hear that crackling noise in the car, even with the skeletonized door. While riding my bicycle in 30 mph winds with the skeletonized door, I do not hear wind noise. The mic picks up the sound of my car engine just fine, and can even pick up the radio playing at a low volume. It is actually better than the microphones on my Sony Action Cam. The GoPro mic now has better audio range with no distortion.The menu system is the same as last year's Hero3, which is still slow and cumbersome to use when you know the setting you want is about 30 clicks away. The LEDs are still very bright and grabs too much attention when filming at night. There are only 3 settings for the LEDs: all 4 on, 2 on, and all off. The problem is that the front LED is always on unless you turn all of them off. What I'd like to see is having the option of only keeping a rear LED on. In addition, having the blue WiFi (for the GoPro app) LED and red recording LED on when attached to the front of your windshield could attract unnecessary attention because red and blue lights on the front of your vehicle are generally authorized only for emergency vehicles.Low light recording is pretty good compared to other similar action cams. However, that is not saying much. With ProTune enabled, there is an excessive amount of noise in low light conditions even with the auto Low Light feature enabled. The noise is similar to using too high of an ISO for film or digital shots. In nighttime recordings on streets without ambient light (and say, just your headlight), the darkness is excessively noisy. The option is to turn ProTune off, or to keep ProTune on and adjust it in post processing.The field of view settings are the same: narrow is about 90 degrees and almost gives an unmodified view of the world. Medium is a good compromise probably around 120 degrees, while Wide has obvious distortions at the edges. The new SuperWide setting is very cool and artistic for those special shots. The narrow setting has the least distortion, so it is what I found to be most useful for onboard footage of motorcycles and cars at the race track, but medium isn't bad either and gives a slightly wider view to capture corners, etc...The GoPro optics aren't really designed for distance acuity. They are designed primarily to focus at close ranges, basically taking selfies as you parachute into a volcano or from outer space. The optics are akin to a near-sighted person going outside without glasses. Objects are sharp about 1 car length ahead. Beyond that, things get blurry but not too bad. Just don't expect to count blades of grass.In terms of video quality, I'd pick my FujiFilm XP200 and Samsung S3 smartphone over the GoPro. The S3 has image stabilization and in 1080P/30fps mode, the video quality is just significantly better. It will allow you to see objects clearly farther ahead. The problem is the S3 isn't as durable as the GoPro, and the XP200 is bulky. The S3 for some reason records with almost no compression artifacts but its optics are able to pick up objects farther away, all with a smaller bitrate.If you opt to turn ProTune off with the Hero3+ Black Edition, I observed compression artifacts on objects like grass, when driving by them at speed. The Sony Action Cam is also notorious for doing this. With ProTune turned on, the footage looked much better.The rolling shutter effect was a major problem with the Hero3 Silver Edition, mainly because of the 30fps speeds. I had the same issue with the Sony Action Cam prior to the firmware update. The 60 fps frame rate is necessary for any type of action footage, it greatly mitigates the rolling shutter effect, and the footage just looks spectacular. Others have recommended the 720p 120fps mode because it doesn't sacrifice much video quality but the faster frame rate is smoother. With the Hero3+ Black in 60 fps, there wasn't any noticeable rolling shutter effect.What I'd still like to see in the future: The GoPro still lacks image stabilization which makes it a poor choice on high-vibration environments such as being mounted directly on the frame of a road bike or motorcycle. Rumor is that the Hero4 will have image stabilization, or at least the Hero4 will be using a video engine that is capable of image stabilization. As-is, the Hero3+ will work fine mounted on the windshield of a car (which has a better suspension system and vibration damping than a rigid aluminum road bike). The video optics could also be improved. Given the fact my Samsung Galaxy S3 has a much smaller camera with only 8MP capability, the S3 still takes clearer pictures and videos than the GoPro.Overall: 4/5 stars, this is what the 2012 Hero3 Black Edition should have been. GoPro fixed the audio quality issues and the performance issues appear to have been resolved, it also helps to use a fast SD card. As a result, I give the Hero3+ Black Edition a high recommendation if you're interested in taking action footage, but it is very expensive for what it is. The video quality blows away the Sony Action Cam, but it is also durable enough to be used in many environments while the Galaxy S3 is really just a fragile smartphone.However, I'd say wait for the Hero4. It should have image stabilization, improved optics that are clearer at all distances, and even better battery life.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works well for me", "Author": "Stefan Eulenstein", "ReviewID": "R18Q0KMYT9NX1L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a hero 3 and returned it for a 3+be.

This could save you over a hundred dollars in accessories in additional improved usability. For example, framing your picture with the old Hero3 is pretty tedious with trial and errors. It would help if you have video back ($75), otherwise you will do a lot of mounting and dismounting, load and test the video with your laptop.

But then, neither did I have a doubt in GoPro's quality assessment procedures, nor there were instructions on how to test the casing at home. It's not hard for most obvious kinds of flaws: submerging closed empty case in water (sink or tub) with temperature different from that of the ambient air would do the trick, if it's flawed, it will either almost instantaneously start emitting bubbles (in colder water), or, much more slowly, will start letting the water in.I did not do that, and to my terror, the $500+ assembly of camera, memory card, monopod, and mount came unraveling on the first snorkel dip. Less than 15 minutes in, I noticed salt water inside the housing and rushed ashore, sea urchins under my feet notwithstanding.My second fault was contacting GoPro's customer service. After 20 minutes waiting for my call to be picked up (granted, it was Saturday morning), they understood and were willing to replace the device given the failure. Except, even after receiving a video demonstrating the housing flaw, the best recourse they could promise was an approximate 15 day turnaround from the day I send damaged gear back. My point about having bought the camera specifically for the (understandably short) vacation I was on fell on deaf ears. Although there was at least one GoPro shop on the island, they wold not offer to replace faulty gear right away, and my request over email to escalate the case was just ignored.Enter Amazon. Upon returning home 7 days after the ordeal (that in no small degree spoiled my tropical vacation), they answered my call with no wait time at all (at 8 p.m. Pacific on Tuesday), listened to my story, and in 10 minutes a UPS return label was in my email inbox. Full refund, no further questions. Bravo, Amazon! I am still stuck with unwanted monopod and memory card that cost me $100+, but eventually I'll put them to use.Just not with GoPro gear, I'm afraid.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Must have", "Author": "Tiago Pariz", "ReviewID": "R8I4684S9A5TA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is awesome!

There are sacrifices...", "Author": "Super Mum", "ReviewID": "R235H5R2KXUW1M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The GoPro Hero has been marketed as the ultimate adventure camera. It can handle surfing, scuba, snowboarding, and extreme conditions.  It is lightweight and itty bitty so it can easily be mounted to a surfboard, helmet or your body without weighing you down.  It does work well in these conditions (well, we don't do snow but we have used it in every other condition).Our family has another shockproof/waterproof/etc. camera and these are thing things I am not as fond of with the Hero3+ Silver:  -  No zoom.  Usually \"entry level\" waterproof cameras don't have optical zoom but most typically have digital zoom.  Yes, digital zoom isn't amazing but the option should at least be there to get a better shot of the subject matter.  Often times I had too much landscape and not enough of the object I was hoping to capture.  This can also make for a less focused picture on the desired target.  -  Pieces!  My other camera has a battery door that is connected, it also has a door for the charging port that is connected.  The Hero3+ has neither.  The teeny tiny little pieces of plastic are hard to find and the charging door must be removed during charging or hooking up to a computer.  I haven't lost one permanently YET. I'm sure it is only a matter of time. I spent a good half hour looking for the charging door the other day.  -  This is a small complaint as it seems most electronic manufacturers are going this way but it does not come with an AC adapter. It comes with a USB cord that can be plugged into a computer but you will have to swipe an AC adapter from another company that didn't try to save a couple of bucks.  -  No screen to view photos.  I'm torn about this one.  A screen would likely increase the size of the camera thus making it less \"mountable.\" However, when snorkeling, scuba diving, floating down a river, etc. I often like to check the photo to make sure I got the whole fish/turtle/group on inner tubes  in the shot.  I would recommend not using this camera for the first time during something extremely important to you (your first dive in Hawaii).  Play with it first. Get to know it.  Be cognizant of how much it captures (width/height).  Play with how you hold it or where you mount it to determine how you need to position your body/arm to capture the photo/video you want.  -  Battery does not last nearly as long as my other camera. I usually get around an hour of constant use.The upside to the Hero3+ Silver:  -  Size. As mentioned before, its size is what makes it mountable on just about anything.  -  Wide angle lens captures a great amount of the landscape (though see no-zoom above... sometimes too much landscape and not enough of the subject).  -  App works flawlessly.  My other waterproof/shockproof camera did not have onboard WiFi and I remedied this with a EyeFi.  It was always dropping connection and never seemed to want to transfer when I needed it to.  Not having to rely on a third party app and hardware is nice.  -  Mounting options. There are a ton of great accessories (sold separately) for this product that truly make it versatile to whatever your needs are.  -  Waterproof up to 131'.  My other camera does not have the ability to go this deep and I can only use it for shore dives, surfing, snorkeling and the pool.  This camera allows me greater versatility.*Word of caution as the holidays are coming up.  The camera uses a MICRO SD card (not a regular SD).  Many people don't have these floating around their home and you should consider purchasing a Micro SD (must be \"Class 10\" to be compatible) so they can play with it as soon as it is unwrapped.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buy a 3 for less, not a 3+.", "Author": "D.

It boasts several  ultra-high-resolution capture modes and high frame rates for standard HD resolutions; burst speeds for still photos has been greatly improved in this iteration.My impressions of the GoPro Hero3+ are:- small form-factor- lots of mounting flexibility included.  But for more, I purchased the GoPro Head Strap Mount- very few controls.  Using sub-menus takes a little getting used to, but toggling between menus is doable.The small form factor - which is smaller than previous models - consolidates inputs and outputs down to two ports and a SD card slot.  On either side of the Hero3, you'll find a small pinhole microphone for audio recording alongside your video. GoPro claims that its wind reduction algorithms have been improved for this generation. Like the previous generation, the camera comes with a swappable Skeleton back panel for its clear plastic case that can be used to further improve audio quality at speeds below 100 mph at the expense of waterproofing.One of the negative issues I found (and it is a little picky) has to do with form factor and the door that covers the ports.  It is not attached in any way and would be easy to lose - especially given the fact that this is a camera for sports of all kinds.Overall a wonderful camera that can be mounted in various ways.  It provides ease and flexibility for those who want to film fishing, water sports, snow sports or just want to enjoy a mounted camera out in the wilderness.  There are so many different uses for it.

Huge bump on this one.  Achieved mostly by software/hardware optimizations I believe, battery is the same physical size, mAh is up about 130 (from 1050 to 1180 I believe).* Faster wifi, supporting a new standard (theoretically 4x faster), and better range.* SuperView mode.  This is basically something that you could do manually in post, but now the camera gives you the ability to do it right on camera.  Basically uses all available pixels, and while it seems like a gimmick, it's really quite awesome in practice.  For users like me who don't do much post processing, this is great.* Better lens, supposedly 33% less distortion.* Size.  This is the most noticeable, size and weight get dropped 20%.  However this is almost completely in the case.  Case is completely redesigned, much sleeker.  Accessories that use the case or need a case extension, if you already own these you'll have to buy the pieces to go with it (or drop your Hero3+ in the old case), and I believe most new accessories will comes with pieces for both (for instance the new go pro caps and lids comes with a lid that fits both).  The waterproof rating went down, but I believe it's in the 200-300 foot range, and if that's an issue, again you can use the old case. (As a side note you cannot use the old camera in the smaller case as there is a notch in the lens area that prevents this.  I assume because of field of view being blocked by the smaller opening, and the old one not being optimized for it, you could push it in there...but they put the notch there for a reason.Overall its a small incremental improvement.  This may come at a disappointment to some, but it continues making the camera great, knocking away issues that people had.

Should have made it a flat or wing nut style. The other issue I wish it had a zoom button. I spotted this really cool leaf bug out on the trail but couldn't get close enough to it to have it show up on video without scaring it away! Would be great to have a zoom button in the online controls. How about a warning beep if mud or anything blocks the screen?? Never thought to keep checking it during fun times for mud on screen, mostly due to being new with it. What a disappointment to find a glob of mud got on camera during a dangerous ride and it effected the video quality. Just some food for thought for GoPro. The camera it self is great, love it, works fine but don't think it's any better quality than my Contour roam 1st generation, same video quality, but the Wi-Fi ability pushed it to the top. The Contour you have to have a computer with you to be able to see video or wait till you get home. That's the feature that sold me on the GoPro to be able to instantly view my video on my iphone right after the ride! Too COOL! Yeah battery life sucks, so make sure you have at least 2 extra as well as extra sd cards. The large field of view does take in quite a lot of your environment but on the bike trail it doesn't due justice to the large rocks and roots you jump over due to camera taking in everything in your view. When looking down at the rocks it seems like there farther away than they are? Just some nit picky things I noticed. Don't get me wrong this camera goes out the door with me on every trip!

It's hard to say something about this product that hasn't already been said by another reviewer.  However, if you are currently contemplating buying either this or the regular GoPro Hero3 Black Edition... I would definitely buy this one over the older version. The main reason being that the older version had horrible battery life.  This newer upgraded version has 30% better battery life and is 20% smaller.  Also, some people had complained about blurry video quality of the older Hero3 and I noticed this one advertises it to have 33% improved sharpness/image quality. This also lends to my belief that they made this version to fix the shortcoming of the older Hero3. I think these improvements alone is worth the added price...although I think that they should have just replaced the older GoPro Hero3 with this version instead of still selling both of them.  I mean, they should have just discontinued the older Hero3 and sold this one at the same price as the older Hero3.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "A hypothesis at best...", "Author": "T.

It's a nice sounding hypothesis with some sort of voodoo marketing magic, but the product itself is a joke that costs 10x its worth... wow, it's bad!Some highlights:-WiFi didn't give me a live view (\"preview\") out of the box, so I updated the firmware (and WiFi settings 3 times) which promptly made the WiFi stop working while the camera was on all together. (strangely WiFI can be left on even though the camera is off, which promptly drains the battery in under 10 minutes)- WIth WiFi on and camera on, the battery last about 15 minutes.-With WiFi on the battery heats up the camera in about 5 minutes to the point of being hot. I'm no expert, but sounds like a problem to me.- Turning the camera and wifi on and off isn't trivial. Since the buttons are used for various things you have to either try a few times and cycle through everything, or time how long you hold them to a fraction of a second.- Image quality is poor (My phone does as well) and having to correct for the ridiculous fisheye effect on a PC only adds additional time and effort, and reduces the quality more.- No view screen, so, there is no way to frame image without WiFi (if you can get it working and aren't dropped b/c of noise) or HDMI wires (Not water proof anymore). I suppose this doesn't matter because of the fisheye view. Basically it is useless as a camera in this sense. You get what it delivers and thats it.- No usable sound with case on; no way to mount it without case. No way to plug in a good mic.-Micro SD card capacity choices are small.

For situations where we are replacing a water damaged camera, we replace the camera, housing, and battery. We do not cover the SD card since it is not a part we manufacture. You can try reaching out to the SD card manufacturer to see if they can help you with that.As you know, water damage is not something that's covered in our warranty, however we decided to replace it under warranty as courtesy prior to inspecting the housing in question. I double checked that the sales order for your replacement battery was delivered and that has been confirmed.Please let us know if you have any further questions.Many Thanks,Sergio B.GoPro Support[...]", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a professional camera", "Author": "Phil Blampied", "ReviewID": "R4Q220663XDZE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought one of these for semi-professional use and was mislead by the sales associate.  I would describe this as basicallya point and shoot amateur camera that has the durability to withstand rough handling but basically produces shaky home movies, albeit in high definition.  It has no viewfinder so you only know how the shot was framed after you download it.  It has poor sensitivity to room light and seems designed mostly for outdoor use.  It has no zoom or focal capacity so, like the old fashioned Kodak brownies, you get a fixed focal range.  It has two wide angle settings which offer a kind of \"gee-whiz\" factor but it looks as though it would produce an effective image only at fairly close range.
