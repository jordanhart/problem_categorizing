A friend of mine has the same camera, the SONY cybershot and can't stand it either. She likes the NIKON better too. I want the NIKON again and been wanting to sell the SONY. The picture quality isn't as good esp when you do have to hurry and shoot, there is no option to print the date/time on the pics, fireworks and the like are a blurry something, just a few things of the overall impression. not impressed with this camera", "Date": "November 23, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.95", "Features": null, "Name": "Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W50 6MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4199Tex7WaL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000J35D1Y"}}
