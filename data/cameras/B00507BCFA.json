You can pull this out of the box and have it running in 5 minutes (If you have RCA to twist lock adapters for the cameras). You will need to purchase special connectors to hook RCA cables to the back. Security cameras usually use a twist-on connector (Which this DVR has).It comes with a mouse that allows you to click on which camera or option you want. Very simple.It has a picture-in-picture so you can watch one camera using the full screen while a second camera (In a small box) can be viewed.Most reviews that I read were about users who could not play back what they recorded. This is a simple problem. You can set the cameras to only record if they see motion. So, if there was no motion, then the camera did not record anything. The user just needed to set the camera to record mode (And not motion activated mode).I love it. You do not need to purchase a separate splitter because it is built in. My power went out for an hour and the internal clock stayed the same and it started recording on its own when the power came back on.I highly recommend this DVR.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love these things", "Author": "Installer", "ReviewID": "R1MQ3P5RHF28LQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works great!
