Being able to burn a rewritable CD - at a cost of less than $5 per CD with 150MB - is a BIG advantage over memory card style cameras (a 128MB card can run a couple hundred dollars).  The electronic storage problem that I faced with memory cards no longer applies (I travel a lot and always have my camera in my hand so you can imagine the number of pictures taken).I have been able to store close to 100 pictures at the highest resolution on one CD making it very easy to file, catalog and find my pictures.  I have not had the problem that the previous reviewer did in being able to delete a picture and reuse the space.  He must be using regular CDs (certainly an option) rather than the rewriteable ones.  It was very easy to initially set up and use and has multiple ways to get the pictures to my PC.  I usually use the USB hook-up and even use the camera as a rewriteable CD for pictures other folks send me.  When I am feeling lazy, I just plop the CD in my DVD drive which also works great.With 3.3 megapixels, the picture clarity couldn't be better.  I have printed out 8 x 10s that look like they were taken by an expensive 35mm camera.  The number of options for picture sizing is also enough to satisfy any \"normal\" requirement.If I had to point out one issue with the camera, it is size.  While certainly not the largest camera on the market, it is a bit bulkier than I would prefer (I like sticking a camera in my pocket and I need to use a fanny pack to carry this one around).All in all, if you are looking for a camera that can take 35mm quality pictures and still stay digital, I would highly recommend this Sony.", "Date": "July 19, 2001"}, {"Title": "Absolutely fantastic camera!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R52TS571WCHN5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "... I, too, love this camera and pretty much agree with everyone else. This is the best purchase I've made in quite some time, so I'm just going to provide some information that I wish I'd had before I ordered the camera. The camera is fairly bulky. It's pretty much what you'd expect for a device with a built in CD writer but, when compared to other digital cameras, this thing's pretty big. I personally think that the benefits of writing the picture to a CD more than outweigh the minor inconveniences of a larger camera, but you should probably go to a local store that carries one and see if the size will bother you. Didn't bother me much at all. The delay in taking the picture can be annoying at times. Yes, there is a delay BETWEEN pictures as well (a more pronounced delay, in fact) due to the camera writing the image to the CD, but there's also a lesser talked about delay for even the very first picture. You need to hold the button halfway down for the camera to focus properly, and then wait 'til the camera tells you it's ready before you can take the picture. There isn't much of a wait, but there IS one and it can be aggravating at times. This particular delay, however, as far as I know, is common to ALL digital cameras, so I'm assuming that a digital camera just isn't a very good option for taking pictures that require split-second timing. You will probably want a case for this camera. The lens DOES have a cap, but the display doesn't and can be scratched fairly easily. You'll probably also want an additional battery and separate charger if you're more than an occasional user. The battery lasts about 90 minutes (without flash) and has a built-in chip that tells the camera how much time is left ... a pretty nice feature that's displayed for all to see in picture taking mode. I've seen mixed reviews on the CD-R / CD-RW debate. I have used the CD-RW discs exclusively so far and haven't had any problems. One thing you should be aware of is that you can't go back and erase the pictures on the discs selectively. You CAN erase the last picture taken (if using CD-RW media) and replace it with your very next picture, but you can't go back further than one picture. Well, to be more specific, you ARE allowed to go back and erase a picture older than your last one, but it won't gain you any more disc space. You CAN, of course, erase the whole disc and use it again whenever you wish (again, if using CD-RW), but you just can't go back, let's say, five pictures, erase one picture, then expect the disc space to increase enough to allow more pictures than it would have had if you'd left that picture on the disc. The camera often takes dark pictures. I've found that the picture is normally of better quality if I force the flash ... even in fairly well lit areas. There may be another technical tweak that would accomplish the same thing, but I'm an extreme novice when it comes to photography. It's VERY hard to find cases to protect these little discs! I have yet to find one. When buying these little discs, you usually have a choice of approximately 50 CD-R's on a spindle, or approximately 10 Mavica CD-R's in little cases ... both cost roughly the same price, but you can't seem to find protective sleeves or cases for the ones with a spindle. Not exactly a deal breaker, but annoying nonetheless. One disc holds about 81 pictures at the highest quality (which is absolutely breathtaking), and over 1000 at the lowest quality (which you will probably NEVER want to use). If you have a good printer, print the picture on photo quality paper, and use the highest quality setting, I don't think you'll be able to tell the difference between that picture and an actual photograph. I am an EXTREME novice at photography and I have taken some stunning pictures with the default settings, but this camera also has a dizzying array of manual settings for even the most advanced photographer.I couldn't seem to easily find what out what this camera was SUPPOSED to come with, so that's what I'm supplying.Camera.One battery.Lens cap.Adaptec Direct CD software.MGI Photo software.USB cable for connection to computer.Power supply for the camera (used to charge the battery).8cm adapter to put the mini-discs into a regular drive.Manufacturer warranty (I think it's one year, may be 90 days).One CD-R media.One CD-RW media. Well that's about what I wanted to know when I was thinking of buying this camera.

It arrived just in time for our 4th of July family reunion. I took 450 pictures over 5 days and had only one that was not a keeper (credit camera, not photographer). The camera allows you to not only review your shots, but to zoom up to 5X to really check out the details of the photos you've taken.  Each evening we would hook the camera up to the TV with the RCA cable (included) and set the camera on \"Slide Show\". It was so much better than I imagined, beautiful high-resolution photographs of the day automatically displayed for everyone to enjoy (and critique).  When the week was over I downloaded slide show software from CyPics and burned a CD for everyone to have all 450 pictures at a cost of less than a dollar per CD. Plus, they can insert the pictures into Word for cropping and printing with almost no effort at all. I have yet to use the USB cable since it is no problem to just use my pc's CD drive. I had planned to archive my photos on the camera's small CD, but it is so easy to copy them to the hard drive and burn a larger CD with about 800 photographs that I have gone to using the rewriteable CDs in the camera. I use the 2nd highest resolution on the MVC-CD300 and get about 150 shots per CD and they give excellent 8x10 prints.  The cost per shot (including archiving) is almost nothing, so you feel totally free to snap away.

It not only uses the CD-R but uses CD-RW!  Using the rewriteables is by no means perfect, but is definitely worth it.It is definitely cheaper to pick up additional mini-CDs than purchase additional memory sticks or floppies, or purchase another piece of hardware that will allow you to download the images to a storage device (or even lugging a laptop with you).The only thing I wasn't too happy with was the fact that once you took the picture it burned it to the CD.  You were not really given the chance to determine if it was a keeper, but that is just a very minor thing.I'm still learning how to use it, I've only had it since July 5, but so far my friends who just purchased digital cameras a few months ago are wishing they had waited for this one.", "Date": "July 11, 2001"}, {"Title": "Forget all that expensive flash memory", "Author": "Pete", "ReviewID": "R3PVONZ4HKIAII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Tired of just taking 20 photos and then having to go home and tranfer th pictures to you computer. Well the sun has finally risen over the horizon of digital cameras. This camera uses an 88 cent 8cm mini cd for its film. You get to take 99 pictures per disc at its highest resolution in the least compressed jpg mode. Each picture is around 1.2 megabytes in fine compression max resolution. You can even take uncompressed photos if you want maximum clarity at print sizes over 8x10 with only 9 megabytes used up per picture. Try that with a dimage 7!!!The ability to make 15 second 320x240 mpeg 1 movies is cute. the other format for moving pictures is a multi image gif file. sony calls it clip mode. point your web browser at it to see the frames fly by, just like all those moving ads do itAfter you buy this camera you should also get a S70 adapter, 52mm lens protector (UV filiter), and a 52mm lens cover (the one that comes with the camera is not 52mm. A .8 netural denisty would also come in handy for those wide apeture blured background shots in the daytime. Since this camera has such a fantastic manual white balance forget about buying the FL-D and the rest of the light correcting filters. just put in one touch mode, point it at your scene and volia the colors look ok.After using it for a few short vacations i discovered i prefered cd-r discs. With a cd-rw you can only reclaim space on the disc if you erase the last photo taken. otherwise its no different then a cd-r unless you want to wipe the whole thing clean with a format. the only benifit of cd-rw is with rotate which actually rewrites over the existing image rather than burning another.    The key to night shots is to put it in manual mode a=3.5 s=30 is a good starting point. Its cumbersome to keep haveing to switch back to setup mode to change the preset scene mode to a different one. The cameras brain does not automaticly use the flash when you need a fill light. you will have to waste the first photo to notice you subject is a black siluette, and force the flash for your next shot.The mini cd's are becoming very popular as there are a ton of tiny MP3-CD players commig out which use em", "Date": "October 19, 2001"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera, easy to use.", "Author": "Mark Hornberger", "ReviewID": "R3PKROT2HQWD8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, let me say I'm not a professional or even semi-pro photographer. I wouldn't know an f-stop if it landed on me. That being said, I love this camera. It's extremely easy to use. I bought mine in Tokyo, so the manuals were of course in Japanese (which I don't read or speak) but I still figured out the camera with no problems. If you can figure out something without a manual you can read, then the thing wasn't very complicated. The pictures are fantastic, in my opinion. The cd-rw works very well. You have to initialize the disc, then finalize it to be read in your computer's cd-rom. With cd-rw discs you can then unfinalize them in the camera to store more pictures on the disc. Each of these procedures take a couple of minutes, and you have to sit the camera on a flat surface and not move it during that time. If you use plain cd-r discs, you can't unfinalize them. I've read that some cd-rom drives have difficulty reading from cd-rw discs, but mine had no problem. If you have an older cd-rom, you might have to use cd-r discs instead of cd-rw. But since you can get them for less than a dollar and store 150+ images, you're still getting a bargain compared to Memory Stick or Smartmedia prices.The camera comes with one cd-rw and one cd-r disc, but will work with 80mm discs from other companies. You do get a nag-screen on the LCD saying \"Mavica discs recommended\" if you use non-sony media, but I figure that's okay with me, considering how much cheaper non-Sony discs are. P>There is very little lag time between pics, much less than I expected. 2 seconds or so, usually less. This is my first digital camera so I don't know if that's a long time compared to other cameras, but I was surprised, considering the image is being burned to a disc. However, I've read that if you use the 'uncompressed TIFF' option, it takes 30+ seconds to write the 10Mb image to the disc. The cd-rw speed is 4x.One cool thing is that you can zoom in up to 5x in images that are stored in the camera, move around within the image to see the part you want, and crop the pic if you want to while it's still in the camera, no computer needed. You can hook up the AV cable to see this on your TV as you're doing it. The battery recharges inside the camera - there is no external battery charger. So if you buy an extra battery, like I did, you can't charge it while you're using the camera. That's the only complaint I have, and it isn't much of a complaint.For a long time serious photo hobbyists have turned up their noses at the Mavica line, but I think this should change because of this camera. 3.3 megapixels makes for excellent pictures, and the flexibility allows for a lot of control over the more advanced features. I can't recommend this camera highly enough.----After owning the camera for a couple of weeks, I have to make a small addition.  There is no optical viewfinder, which is a problem under dim lighting conditions.  For nighttime shots or macro work where vibration is more of a problem, you would want to use a remote control, and the only remote control available is the one built into Sony tripods.  You can get around the vibration problem by using the timer, but it would still be nice to have a wired remote control.  Those are my only nags thus far.  I would still buy the camera without hesitation.", "Date": "August 15, 2001"}, {"Title": "Almost Perfect", "Author": "Spokey", "ReviewID": "R1BXXBXAQLWBHL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "... I think the 300 is almost perfect. However there a couple things that could have been done better so I'm focusing on the negatives here. Things that won't be fixed:... I dislike the write time for each picture. The run time for a battery is not long enough. At best you'll get about an 1 1/2 hours. Part of the problem is that the lcd is the only way to view. It has a switch to shut off the backlight, but even on the sunniest days, you can barely see your subject with the light off. Interchangeable lens would have been nice. You can get some attachments, but truly interchangeable lens would be better.There are some irritating aspects as well. I find that the natural grip causes me to touch the lcd and leave thumb prints on it all the time. I often find that I've mysteriously set the macro button. I've taken a few pictures in macro mode without realizing it. The most irratating is that Sony harasses you for not buying their expensive media (about 6-8 times more costly than the good ones I buy elsewhere). Everytime you turn on the camera you get the message \"Sony recommends Mavica CDs only\" or some such thing. Things Sony could fix:My biggest complaint is that it doesn't come with a cover for the LCD. I primarily bought the camera to carry around on bike trips and I keep it in my front handlebar bag. The lcd is already pretty bady scratched from bouncing around inside the bag.The battery charger that comes with it is pretty inconvenient. You need to open a little door to plug in the cord. That little plastic door isn't too sturdy. A better idea would have been to give you a charger like the cheaper one they sell that you could also plug into the camera. I bought the charger and a second battery and am a lot happier. The new charger is also more portable.Like I said up front, I'm pleased with the camera. I plan on taking it on a cross country bike ride and anticipate a small stack of CDs will last me.

I've owned the camera since August, and at first could only find the mini CDs on-line.  Now I can get them at local business supply or computer stores.  I recommend the CD-RW to get the most out of the media.

The only way to correct for that is to use a flash, and then all the pictures come out in stark glaring color.  It is impossible to get good light balance in the photos.  And the camera always insists on using the flash, even when outside.Other problems include time -- You can't just point and click... the camera has to think before taking the picture, so you ALWAYS lose the candid shots and instead get pictures of the backs of people's heads.  Sometimes it can take up to ten seconds before the camera actually takes the picture... and I have no idea why.  A similar but unrelated problem is disk-access.  After you take a picture, it has to save it to the disk, and that can take five or more seconds, in which time you can't do anything.On the good side, the camera captures an incredible amount of detail.  You could probably print poster-sized pictures and still not see any pixelization.  It is remarkable.To sum up: If they can fix the color/light problems and processing time problems, then we might have a winner.  Until then, I'll have get used to pictures of the backs of people's heads, in blue.", "Date": "November 12, 2002"}, {"Title": "Loved it but ready to leave it...", "Author": "Keith \"kc31824\"", "ReviewID": "RO3ITWW7T1KC6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera in most respects.  It's hard to take a bad shot -- as someone who wouldn't be able to deal with all the adjustments on a real SLR, this seems to be the next best thing... good lens but the camera does the work as though its a point-and-shoot.  I've taken 1000s of shots with it.  Battery life is fine.  CD as storage is rather convenient.  BUT, my complaint is the lag times.  Power on lag, shutter lag, and shot-to-shot lag.  It's painful to think of all the shots we've missed waiting for disc writing, or power on, or slow shutters.  The Burst 3 mode is a silly answer -- just doesn't work right in practice.  You can't even see the subject to know if you're still lined up once it starts bursting.  Net: this is an ideal camera for non-moving situations... sunsets come to mind.

I am so glad I waited to buy a digital -- the ability to store to a CD and then reuse the media is unbeatable!  I have had an occasional problem with the camera not booting up and telling me to turn it off and then on again.  It has something to do with the lens because the manual says it only happens to the 300 and when I called Sony tech support the guy tried to tell me the battery was faulty -- and it wasn't.  Otherwise it is a great camera.  Picture quality is comparable to my Minolta X700 35 mm SLR.

With the resolution available with this camera (we can get prints up to 20 x 30 if we wanted to!), we knew this was our choice! At the highest resolution, we can get 73 pictures on one disk (still better than a roll of film!), and with each disk comes out cheaper than buying film! Another advantage, is with our 8 month old daughter, we don't have to wait to get film developed to see that we didn't get a good picture of a special moment. We love the timer for \"family\" shots and  all of the options. If you're looking for a light weight camera to put in your pocket, this isn't it, but if you want to take great pictures (who needs to go to department stores to get \"baby\" pictures taken?!) this is the camera for you.Also, uploading pictures from the disk to Ofoto (Kodak's online website - best selection of prints in my opinion and great deals), does take the better part of a day on my computer with a 56k modem, If you had cable or DSL hookup, it would be faster. That's not the camera's fault, just computer technology.

It's easy to learn to use - comes with a well-written manual (really unusual) - and makes you an expert instantly!  The only drawback I have found is that the digital image can be difficult to see in very bright sunlight - it needs a sun/glare shield.  Records sound with images, records burst action up to 15 seconds, and the built-in flash works well both for low-light conditions and for fill.  Edit as you go, and post on-line from the cd - there's enough storage space to shoot all day, and the battery bounces back to 100% with a quick re-charge.

The tech support is good, they directed me in setting up the USB connection. See page 38 of the manual. One problem I have noticed is with the ACC jack which is used to connect the external flash or tripod. With only one jack on the camera, you can only connect one of these accessories at any given time. In other words, if you purchase the remote tripod and the external flash, you can not shoot a picture using both the flash and remote handle on the tripod at the same time. There should have been either, two jacks or a dual connector. Before you try using a \"y\" connector, I have already been warned by Sony that \"it won't work\". I have had a nightmare of a time in ordering accessories through Sony. They are having serious problems getting the order information straight. Two orders have been fouled up and about two and one-half hours of my time wasted on the telephone. They do not correct orders that they mess up; you have to reorder and just bite the bullet. Otherwise its a good purchase except that they could have had a hot foot so you could use an alternative external flash instead of theirs which can only be connected by its cable into the single ACC camera jack, which you thought you could plug their tripod into.", "Date": "September 20, 2001"}, {"Title": "Digital Camera", "Author": "Lois Parish", "ReviewID": "R19MY42C4QKSUT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has to one of the best digital cameras on the market.
