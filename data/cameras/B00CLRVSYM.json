It shipped earlier than suggested when I ordered, which made me very happy, and everything was as described, with all new Canon equipment in original packaging.  I haven't had much of a chance to get to know the camera and all the pieces that came with it, but so far, it is great.  The camera is light, small and easy to use and the first few preliminary photos are great so I think I'm going to love it!", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "It came with everything I need.", "Author": "Joan A.
