I'm not an overly technical person -- my previous 35mm cameras were basic \"point and shoot\" models, with zoom capability.  But I found the  DC240 extremely easy to set up and use, and I especially like the  near-macro capability (you can get within 6-8\" of your subject and  still have a crystal clear picture.).The on-camera menu is superb --  colorful, very easy to understand -- and I found myself taking good quality  shots immediately.  I also purchased an extra 8MB compact flash memory  \"card\" which came in handy during my first extended use (a  weekend get-away to a scenic area with lots of attractions).  I found it  very easy to review my shots and eliminate any that weren't quite what I  wanted, instead of wasting the shot and having to wait until I got the film  developed to discover that the shot was less than optimal.  I managed to  get a total of 49 color pictures of PRINT quality (as opposed to email  quality -- you have a choice on a picture-by-picture basis) on the two  memory cards (total of 16MB) in this first extended use.  I also managed to  take the pix, review them several times, connect to my home computer, and  upload the entire contents of both chips to my hard drive before the first  batteries (AA -- easy and inexpensive to puchase) ran out.  Not bad!  My  last 35mm camera used to go through expensive N batteries every two rolls  of film.All in all, I'm really thrilled with this camera, and may never  go back to 35mm film cameras again!", "Date": "July 14, 1999"}, {"Title": "Best Picture Quality but WATCH OUT!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3HOJ6B5F2MIK2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the perfect camera for indoor shots but without the option of additional lenses, you cannot get close enough to your outdoor pics to make a good image.Also, the camera does some focus touchups but if your like  me where you overly take a lot of images, and use a clikdrive, this focus  option no longer takes place and you need to stay as still as a  tri-pod.All in all, EXCELLENT camera, Excellent Picture Quality, but if  you have the money, get a kodak model with lense options.Dont forget to  check out photonet and get real prints mailed to your house of your  images..

Got rave reviews of the images shared.  The USB connection is easy and fast.  I found it handled  indoor shots without flash with outstanding resolution.It has also  produced some excellent outdoor shots, including some sky photography  (sunsets) that rival film versions.One does not need to employ the top  setting to produce extremely good pictures, maximizing the number of photos  on a single compact flash card.It came complete with a set of  rechargable batteries and charger - a nice feature.  And the Amazon price  is at least $100 less than any other source!This would be a perfect  camera for a person just starting into digital photography, who wants a  camera that looks, feels,  and acts like a familiar 35 mm point and shoot  and who has elementary knowledge and sense of computers.", "Date": "July 6, 2000"}, {"Title": "Great buy!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2FPBH24NTVUA4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought it for the USB interface, but sent in for the freebie package of accessories which includes a PC Card reader, and use that exclusively now.I can compare it to an older Sony Mavica, and while the picture  quality seems better than Sony's (and far better than I ever anticipated),  and the Kodak itself is more portable BY FAR, its LCD isn't as big or clear  as the one on the Mavica.  Of course, the Mavica doesn't have an optical  viewfinder so it has to have a great LCD, but I don't find the Kodak LCD  useful for framing pictures AT ALL.  It is plenty good enough for reviewing  your pictures (deciding which ones to keep or delete), and it's excellent  for setting the camera options (the UI is great!).Another BIG PLUS for  this camera is the zoom, of course.I don't like the included software at  all:  Picture Easy is a slow-loading hog.  I just use it to get the  pictures off the camera; then I open up my regular graphics editor to  view/edit the pictures; and I use a proprietary online printer's software  to upload the JPGs for printing.But overall, I'd choose this camera over  any other camera in its class.", "Date": "July 15, 1999"}, {"Title": "Great value for the money", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2EX5IX62KBHWO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I also considered buying the Olympus camera at the same price range.

What a long way digital cams have come!I have used  the DC240 quite a bit already and am VERY impressed with the picture  quality and the print quality.  I bought it hoping that I could finally do  away with my film camera for snapshots but was rather skeptical.  I figured  if it wasn't up to par, I would just return it.  It exceeds my expectations  already!I have also printed a number of the photos on glossy photo paper  with an HP DJ 722C.  The average person would not be able to tell that it  wasn't a film camera print.  I printed most of them at 5x7 but printed a  few at 8x10.  1.3 megapixel cameras are not supposed to be photo quality at  8x10 but my prints at that size look great.I have yet to find anything I  don't like about the camera.  It fits well in your hand, has a fast zoom  compared to my Pentax WR90, and is so convenient.I would highly  recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good quality picture at a  price that is very affordable.

I had used and or owned 3 different digital cameras before this one, and was disappointed overall by their various limitations.  Here's what I recommend to anyone buying this wonderful camera.Get yourself a 16MB Compact Flash card (the camera comes with an 8MB one, but you'll find it's not enough to take a ton of photos without running out of space).  That way you'll have 24MB worth of storage to take \"on the road\" with you, which should be more than enough for the moderate user to store photos on before uploading them to your computer.Secondly, buy the kit that has the Battery charger and get 4 extra NiMH AA batteries.  Do not even bother using regular AA batteries in these.  You'll get a lot of use with the NiMH, but standard alkaline will be sucked dry in about 8 minutes.And finally, invest in a USB Compact Flash card reader.  You can find a good one for close to $30, but it will make transferring the pictures off your camera as easy as moving files on your hard drive.  SanDisk makes a nice one that's way too easy to use.The photo quality is magnificent.  If you take them at the highest resolution, you'll get a picture that's likely bigger than your monitor can even display, with crip tightness.  The colors are incredible, and the variable flash settings for different lighting sources are a great plus.And even the pictures at the lowest resolution are fairly crisp, and excellent for use for quick web pictures and internet auctions.There are really only 2 small pet peeves I have with this camera.  The LCD screen is very hard to read in sunlight (but ultimatley not necessary to use in a pinch, anyway), and there's about a 1 second delay when you click the picture, so getting that magic moment in a higher speed event takes some practice to take care of.You can't go wrong with this camera.  It's rugged, takes great pictures, and I'm 100% happy with my purchase.  And it's KODAK, so you know customer support isn't going to be a problem", "Date": "November 16, 2000"}, {"Title": "Great images and excellent, easy to use,  features!", "Author": "Daniel T.

I have had the camera for about 2 months and have taken hundreds of pictures.  I have been very pleased with the results.  Photography is a hobby of mine and, as a result, I am picky about picture quality and accurate color reproduction.  This camera is easy to use, fast to recycle between pictures, and the USB connection is fast and reliable.  I like the optical zoom (I have not tried the digital zoom).  The lens appears to be of good quality.  I have not detected any distortion.  Similar to other LCD screens, the screen on this camera can be difficult to see outdoors.  You can adjust the brightness, but this reduces your battery life.  I have experienced better than expected battery life.  With frequent use, I have replaced the batteries on a monthly basis.

In fact, I have to use a photo editor to tone them down and resize them so they don't take forever to load on the auction page.

I especially like that you can control resolution and compression level separately.  I like to change resolution without dropping quality due to higher compression.  I am  very satisfied with this camera and would definitely buy it again.  Highly  recommend!", "Date": "August 6, 1999"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00000JDEL"}}
