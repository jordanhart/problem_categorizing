PROS: GREAT picture quality for 5x7 or 8x10 prints (rivals my 35mm Canon EOS, which I have sold on ebay). Small but solid feel to it. Now comes with NiMH  batteries which last a long time, and comes with a plug-in charger.  Actually is a great looking camera-will impress your friends. Has its own  internet-upgradeable OS, easy to use, but gives you many options for  shooting, much like a full featured 35mm SLR. CONS: Tiny optical  viewfinder, takes some getting use to. LCD screen fine for reviewing, but  unlike Sony is just about unuseable for taking shots. Must get use to 2 sec  delay from pushing shutter button till picture is actually taken.", "Date": "November 25, 1999"}, {"Title": "Excellent first digital camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3E1S1BT1W0RDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did alot of research on digital cameras before settling on this one. I purchased the DC265 with the lens kit (fun to play with) and a 32MB card with PCMCIA adapter. The PCMCIA adapter is excellent and works very easily  with my PowerBook G3 (OS9) and Windows 95 and 98 laptops I also use. The  card appears as a hard disk on your desktop and the photos can be edited,  copied, deleted, renamed, etc. right on the card - VERY COOL! If you wanted  to you could use the card to back up just about any type of data, not just  photos! Photoshop plugin is also useful. You will also want the optional AC  adapter. Photo quality is excellent even on the lowest resolution and  superb on the highest! The only cons are a (sort of) noisy lens movement on  zoom, and the fact that closeups don't come out framed exactly right since  the lens and viewfinder are a bit off from one another it seems. After a  few practice shots you will easily figure out how to compensate for this,  however. You will get used to the slight digital delay when taking a photo,  as mentioned in other reviews, but it is not a show-stopper. LCD is very  useful and the batteries (and included charger) are great and last a long  time, even with the LCD on. At low resolution/best quality setting you can  easily fit 200 pictures on the 32MB card! This camera wins my vote unless  you can afford one of the $2000 models!", "Date": "December 4, 1999"}, {"Title": "not so great", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2MBX5APIGE3J7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had one for about 2 months and cons are starting to outwiegh the pros. The viewfinder came with plastic shavings inside of it, after pressing the shutter, it takes seconds to take the photo, almost all motion  is blured and it changes red to a pinkish color sometimes. the camara is  akward to hold, the lcd screen displays 3 different seprate images when the  camara is moving.

The first few pictures that I took amazed me, and also my friends.  One of my friends  is a pro. photographer and the first words he uttered was \"what  detail\" I have a few 35mm cameras that I consider quality pieces and  the dc265 is rated on par. You can't go wrong with this one.

Friends have Sony Mavica's, and the rechargable NiMH Pak gives so much of a better option.  If Kodak is going to continue in this  direction, they should at least put out a set of Li-ion rechargables with a  recharger for 4 batteries instead of selling me batteries forever.

Great Pictures", "Author": "MT \"CK\"", "ReviewID": "R1J6EBEW0CSQN1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an awesome camera.  It takes wonderful pictures and is sooo easy to use.  I always get lots of comments as to how great my pictures always look.  I print out my pictures and use them in cards and for gifts.  Everyone thinks that the pictures were taken with a regular film camera or even professionally, that is how good the quality is.

The pictures are overwhelming if the settings are correct. If you depend on the Auto Mode you will end up with many shots that are sub par.  You may need to adjust the lighting to accomodate for indoor and dusk pictures. The shortcomings are the bulking feel when holding the camera for several shots, that is why I prefer the tripod for a steady shot. The optical zoom is pretty good, and the digital zoom is worthless (I hear the same holds for other brands too).", "Date": "November 26, 2001"}, {"Title": "great potential but it's the little quirks that kill it", "Author": "Wayne Chung \"c4victor\"", "ReviewID": "R2BFVE5M3GQNYS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Kodak DC265 is fine for medium/long range subjects.  However, because the viewfinder and the lens are off-center, you invariably get off-center results - unless you use the LCD as your main viewfinder (this eats battery  life and the display resolution makes it hard to make critical shot  decisions).  However, the image quality is quite good for most  outdoor/lighted conditions.The interaction and placement of the  controls are quite good. There are a few key rubber finger and grip  affordances to make the shooter feel in control.  The only cheap part is  the zoom lever.  It's a small horizontal lever, that has to be kicked way  over to one side or the other, and the time delay to lens movement is  sluggish.  The overall construction of the entire body and finish is very  nice. There's plenty of standard features like burst, time-lapse, etc. to  keep most digital camera enthusiasts happy.  A real nice package bonus was  the 4, AA NiMH rechargeable batteries and charger + 16MB storage card.  At  least Kodak was thinking about the entire user experience.Oh, the  software interface is rather silly.  The childlike icons and metaphors for  album creation, etc. makes you create a parallel cognitive hierarchy model  for what is essentially folders/files on your computer.  Something more  straight forward with clear icons and interface is all we want.", "Date": "May 22, 2000"}, {"Title": "Excellent images and intuitive features", "Author": "Dick Snyder", "ReviewID": "R3KJ8FXAOJJK0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I found the DC265 to be an excellent product with intuituve features and high-quality images. The USB connection is idiot-proof and fast. And the technical support I got from Kodak when needed was good. The accompanying  software for managing your shots is simple and effective but not very  sophisticated at image manipulation. The only draw-back to the camera which  takes a little getting-used to is the apparent delay from when you depress  the shutter release 'til it actually releases. Probably more of an  adjustment issue from using regular SLRs.", "Date": "October 14, 1999"}, {"Title": "Fun and easy picture taking", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RP6U6FER9YN4F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great I have had it for a few days and take tons of pictures.
