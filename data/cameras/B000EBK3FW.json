It will take a little time to get used to it because they changed some of the methods of accessing settings.  All of those changes are a big plus in my book.  The lens is still great, the handling has been improved and image quality is excellent.  Some of the new featurs over pervious version;- 2.5\" LCD is just huge, yes lower res but still good.- Standard 52mm filter adapter much better then FZ3/4/5- High angle LCD mode works!  I don't need tilt/twist any more- High sensitivity mode works, but not the best quality imageAll the featurs it adds and at a price MUCH lower then any other FZ has been introduced at, how can you go wrong!!Updated 9/28/06Still love this camera.  Noise is not as big of an issue as some people make it out to be.

Bakker", "ReviewID": "R3BIIXA5O7OMJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera two weeks now, and have had no problems whatsoever with it.  It's my first digital camera, and so I spent about a month shopping around, reading various reviews, checking what needs I had in a camera, etc.  When I knew that I wanted a megazoom, I ended up narrowing my selections to a few cameras: Sony DSC-H2, Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ7, Canon S3IS, and Fuji FinePix s5200.All of them are great cameras and review well.  In many of the reviews I would regularly read of each owner praising their own camera over the traits of the others.  I don't know about anyone else, but I can't afford to own one of each camera to really know what that's like.  What I took it to mean was that most of the people who bought any of these cameras were very happy with them.  In some ways it made things more difficult (which one should I get?), but then in other ways it was a destresser (at least I won't get a dud, whichever I end up with).Going to the stores around here and getting a feel for them in my hand was important.  Everyone's hands are different, so it won't help for people to know which felt comfy in my hands, but I'll say it was a factor.Features-wise, these cameras are all in the same neighbourhood.  Big zoom, mid-high megapixel, and plenty of user-control when it comes to the settings.  The viewscreens vary in size, as does the onboard memory, the kind of memory cards and batteries the camera uses, etc., so these are the major distinctions.  Lenses on these cameras are also very good, no matter which you're looking at.  Fuji and Canon, for instance, are both camera companies before they were into electronics, and Sony uses the Carl Zeiss and Panasonic uses the Leica.  Quibble if you must about the lens quality of one vs. another, but the differences are minute.  All offer some form of image stabilization as well, which is most helpful to me and my big, shaky hands.When decision time came, price became a factor.  The Fuji and Canon were $50-100 more than the Sony, and the Panasonic was another 20 below the Sony.  Again, it wasn't the only factor, but it was in there.Other factor: Power source.  Some cameras run off AA batteries (Sony and Canon, not sure about Fuji), the Panasonic uses a Panasonic brand battery (Lithium-Ion), but you can buy knock-off brands that are much cheaper.  They don't last as long (I have two) as the Panasonic, but I would say they are about 90% of the shooting capacity of the one that came with the camera, at about a fifth of the cost.And last but not least: Storage.  Panasonic and Canon use SD cards, which are cheap and fast.  The Sony uses MemoryStick (a Sony product) that costs more.  Not sure on it's performance, but from what I could tell from other reviews, a highspeed (UltraII by Sandisk, for instance) SD card was more than adequate.  I got a 1G UltraII SD card and it holds 334 pics at max resolution.  It's a fine performer, and fits into my laptop's cardreader.  Very fast transfer from card to CPU for editing and such.  Way faster than the included USB cable.With the Panasonic, I make the tradeoff that memory is relatively cheap and flexible with other cameras and computers, but I have to have my batteries charged and ready for picture taking.  With the Sony I could have gone to any corner store most anywhere in the world and picked up two AA's to operate the camera.  They don't last as long as NiMH AA's, but they'll work fine when you have no other choice.  To me that was a trade I'm willing to make, since I have three batteries (each rated for 270-300) and being able to acquire more storage cheaply would be better for what I need.If you get this camera, you will be very pleased with the pictures you take, though that doesn't mean that you would be displeased with the others I mentioned.  Make sure you get a chance to hold the cameras in your hand, and see what your priorities are going to be in picture taking.  If you're always on the road and charging batteries is a problem, this camera might not be the one for you (charging the battery for this camera takes 2 hours), but if that isn't an issue, this camera is an excellent choice.The only criticism people have had of this camera has been 'noise' at high ISOs, but that's not something I've noticed.  I'll be doing some night shooting soon, so I'll experiment and see what I can get.  As for the other positive reviews of picture quality, clarity, colour reproduction, etc. - I echo those heartily.  Again, this is not a camera that disappoints.  You'll be very pleased with the results.Happy shooting!", "Date": "September 14, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very Satisfied", "Author": "Informed Shopper \"hal2007\"", "ReviewID": "R4BHEOQHRTFZ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera replaces 35 year old Nikons with all the lenses etc that were available at that time.  I have been reluctant to join the digital camera set.  This Panasonic is simply an outstanding product.  In one small package you replace many heavy lenses and two Nikons I have been carrying.  Prior to my purchase I tried to research hard and read mostly positive reviews on this camera.  They were absolutely correct and many of the negative comments have turned out to be either very very picky or simply not reading the manual.  The strong suits to this Panasonic FZ7 for me are the portrait and macro quality.  The Leica lens is excellent and the results are excellent.  I have now taken over 400 pictures with this camera and had one portrait printed by a custom lab.  They were impressed also. Portraits are just outstanding and so are close-ups such as mountain wild flowers.  The ease of use is outstanding.  Yes you have to read the manual and yes you have to do some practicing but you get out of this camera what you put into it.  Battery life is outstanding. I love the provided battery and don't want to be carrying AA batteries. Charging for 2 hours from completely dead is impressive and being able to take several hundred photos on one charge sold me. For the most part the software that comes with it is good although I am not sure why you would need 4 different photo programs and it seems they could have put their effort into just one great photo program.For the amateur photographer I consider this camera to be outstanding as long as you will study the manual and try the different settings.  There are many settings and they do produce the desired results.  There is, of course, a \"simple\" setting which frankly I haven't tried yet because this camera is so easy to use the more advanced settings.  For an old film camera guy its a joy to take as many pictures as I want and delete the bad ones.  Seeing your results instantly is impressive and its so easy to watch on your TV that was actually the first place we did watch.I also find the view finder to be an absolute joy.  The LCD screen is more than adequate for most conditions but I find that in bright sunlight(sun behind you) the view finder is such a joy that I find myself using it more and more.  The detailed information available within the view finder is in such sharp detail its amazing.  Didn't know that was possible.The arguments against this camera might be that it doesn't fit into your pocket but its so lightweight and the 12X zoom is so impressive I love to carry it.  I bought a small case for it that fits it nice and tight and at Sam's Club I bought a 1GB Toshiba high proformance SD card for under $50. The 1GB card matches the battery capacity at best quality for about 329 pictures at 6M megapixels.  Absolutely no regrets about purchasing this camera.  I was into my third day with it before I even tried the audio.  Who knew?  Good idea!  Another really unreal idea is stabilization in a still camera.  When you are out on the 12X zoom its very impressive. Haven't used a tripod yet and for wildflowers the Nikon just about had to be on a tripod when using the Micro Nikkor lens in wind etc.All of my Nikons will soon be featured on E-Bay.  First though there is this 12 day vacation through 3 Natl Parks.  Hmmm taking my laptop so I can download the SD card because I am thinking at least 1,000 pictures!  It all came down to either this Panasonic or the Canon S3IS with comparable bells and whistles but the Cannon was over a $100 more and I couldn't justify it.This camera will basically take your picture for you if you use all of its capability.", "Date": "July 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Finally what I wanted!", "Author": "BigBertha \"BigBertha\"", "ReviewID": "R3PXX6YNS0TP9J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In January, my beloved Canon s-45 received the dreaded E-18 error.  At two hundred dollars, it is not worth repairing.  I am joining the class action law suit on that Canon camera error (Google for more info if you have that problem).  So I set out to find a viable substitute.I purchased a Pentax Optio S-6.  Very unhappy.  Outdoor pictures were clear but indoor pictures, terrible quality.  We used the camera at a birthday party, put it back in its case and into a purse, and for some inexplicable reason, the LCD screen 'cracked'.So, I returned it.  Turns out that is a common and fatal flaw for that camera.I went to Frys and talked to several people who reccommended that for the money, the Panasonic was the best deal.  My main goal for the camera is to shoot indoor club volleyball action shots with some degree of sharpness and quality.  I realize it would not be the performance of my friends several thousand dollar camera systems, but I wanted something that would 'do'.Well, in this Panasonic, I FOUND IT!  I have had it for a week, and have test run it in every situation, night, action, inside, outside, object, people.  The instruction manual is a bit difficult to read, a little confusing, but once you figure out what you are doing, the camera is a real delight.The inside volleyball shots I got are even more than I'd hoped for.  I have one fun shot that captured no less than four volleyballs in the air, clearly.  That was just a bonus to the player I was shooting.  Don't get me wrong, you cannot get an action still like something you'd see in the newspaper, but you can get something almost as good.I am very happy with this camera.  I have decided to keep it, and am going out to purchase a good case today.  Additionally, we are so happy that we went out and purchased the Panasonic DMC-FX9 for my 22 year old daughter.  Her friend has a slightly older model (also a former Canon user) and is thrilled with it.  We are very happy with that purchase as well.Again, this is not a camera for those looking for the sports page spectaculars.  This is a camera for a person looking to have good quality photos of their every day activities that come out clear, sharp and crisp.Good luck!

Being very mechanically-minded,he is just as intrigued with its operations ,as he is with the finished print.As for my opinion?? I wish I had one of these! I have a very nice pocket-size Nikon,5.1mp,and I bought it so I could carry it in my pocket.

Brosman", "ReviewID": "R1ZW9KY8OMN705", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After nearly 3 months of research, I convinced myself that this camera was the best choice out of all the options I had considered. I had been a digital camera user for about 3 years, just using point and shoot cameras. This camera (along with other super zooms) is a good way to graduate between traditional point-and-shoot cameras and dSLR cameras. Ironically, this model camera happens to be the cheapest along with the one with the best reviews and most features. The Canon S3 seems to be the typical consumer choice, yet this camera has a very odd form factor, and once I picked it up I knew it wasn't right for me. The interface on the software side was confusing and far too \"dumbed-down\" for me. Some test images at the store came out with a fair amount of noise, which is ironic due to the fact that all the camera gurus complain about the extreme noise on this camera. The noise on this camera is there, but not as noticeable as some reviewers make it sound. To put it into perspective, the noise levels are basically viewable in anything above a 11x14 print. Picture quality is strong in nearly all modes, and when you don't know what to use, there is usually a scene mode that will take care of it. Of course, you can always enter Simple Mode, something I personally have never tried, but how bad could it be. In respect to the features of this camera, the form factor, to start out, is amazing. Although it may not look like much, the camera can easily be held with one hand by someone with small hands like myself or large ones like those of my father. On the backside, there is the huge 2.5 inch LCD screen (once again complained about by pro reviewers as not sharp enough, wrong again). Also, a simple set of navigational arrows, a trash button, the EVF, power switch, flash pop button, and a unique joystick that gives you access to all manual controls while in manual modes. The joystick is really great, allowing access to all the manual features whenever I need them. The 12x Optical Zoom is truly amazing, I can sit in my room and zoom so far with such great clarity that my camera can read things that I can't, and I have vision that is far above average. The Leica lens is obviously crafted beautifully, like that of the $4000 cameras that Leica makes. This camera allows a great deal of diversity for experienced users, while also offering options for those who are not as experienced. I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who might want to get closer to the shot with the huge zoom or wants to graduate from point and shoot cameras.", "Date": "November 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great trade-off camera at this price point!", "Author": "D.

I can now say that this camera is a great choice for those that are looking for a trade-off between ultra-compact, and long-zoom SLR.  I recently took it to a Black Eyed Peas concert that was in the evening. The pictures I took at 12x zoom were really good.  The large screen is perfect for sharing with friends immediately.  The simple mode is good for taking most pictures, and if you like to fiddle, it's got just enough of the manual features to give you those options.  It's considerably lighter than a digi-SLR, with a better form-factor (I think) than either the Canon S3 or Sony H2.

It takes spectacular photos and the prints are rich and clean and clear and brilliant.  This is my first upgrade from a 2mp.  I considered the Sony's and the Cannon's, seriously.

It was an upgrade from a 4 year old 4MP camera that I still love. However, I've already put this camera through its paces. I've taken almost 1k pictures and outside of a few that were out of focus (because of me) they all have turned out great. I've shot everything from close up flowers, my son playing, my car after a wax to an entire wedding and reception. First impressions aside, this camera is easy to fall in love with.Nutz and BoltzI wont kid you, the learning curve is two fold and a little steep. There's an \"easy\" mode with included button(just like those Staples commercials) which out of the box makes the camera almost fool proof. Using the other settings takes a while to get used to, and even after a month of shooting, there is still stuff I don't know how to access on the fly.PictureIn bright sun light the picture quality is simply amazing. Spot on colr and exposure. The images I've captured outdoors have been some of the best, crips and vivid. Indoors with a flash you get good pictures but nothing spectacular, It is though more then what a good point and shoot would produce.Cons:At high ISO settings picture quality starts to get a little grainy, but when you resize the image to something smaller, alot of the picture noise is removed. Also as I've read on other sites a good noise reduction tool (software) is probably a must with any camera over 4MP.Can be slow to auto focus at times, so you may miss a shot. However, it has continuous AF which can really help.Pros:Great picture quality, high ISO settings which can be noisy do capture pictures you wouldn't normally have gotten any other way.Small joystick that gives you quick access to manual focus, exposure settings and other cool features.Captures quicktime video at 640x480 @30f and is pretty good at it.

Ray \"ratbastid\"", "ReviewID": "RF7Y0YIO1DLZ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having outgrown my 3mp Olympus point-and-shoot-and-pray camera, I did a bunch of research and settled on the FZ7. It promised the best bang for the buck in high-midrange cameras--and boy does it deliver.Outdoors, in pretty much any light, it takes beautiful, crips shots. The aperature- or shutter-priority modes allow you a lot of control over photographic effects, and are a great lesson in photography for those of us raised on fully-auto cameras. I took it to a Memorial Day party this weekend and shot a bunch of shots that all turned out beautifully, without really needing to think about the settings at all.Indoors, prepare for the flash, or invest in a tripod. While there may be occasionaly indoor shots with sufficient ambient light to shoot by, longer shutter speeds strain the image stabilization to the limits. Fortunately, you can manually set the flash temperature. I've been able to produce several nicely moody interior photos with a cool flash and a hand-tweaked exposure level.It's true--you'll read it here and other places as you research this camera--that grain and noise can be an issue under low-light conditions. I've overcome that by hand-setting the ISO to a lower sensitivity and correcting the exposure to match. If you don't want to use my flash level adjustment trick I mentioned above, but are bound and determined to shoot under live light, you can get a decently noise-free shot, but it will take some manual fiddling.One feature that I didn't see mentioned anywhere is the battery life on this thing. I've owned the camera for just over a week, and according to the on-screen battery meter, I'm still 2/3 charged on my first charge. I bought a second battery, because I hate downtime, but I almost can't imagine needing it.Also, the video quality is great--and the sound this thing captures with its videos is remarkable.All in all, a very nice camera.", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Most Balanced Choice Btwn entry level and SLR!!!", "Author": "Elijah \"(E-dubb)\"", "ReviewID": "R3TL22K189X1OC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first digital camera was a 3.2 mb 3x optical HP...Simple, fit the bill, happy.

It has a lot going for it.Virtually every review, including the one in the June 2006 Popular Photography, comments on the amount of noise the camera produces.  In fact, the Popular Photography review test found the noise level to be \"high/unacceptable\" at every ISO except for 100.  Other reviews found that it would produce acceptable prints up to 5x7 at higher ISOs (while finding the \"high sensitivity modes\" with ISO up to 1600 to be unusable).Notwithstanding the noise problem, the camera is said to have good color and a fabulous optically stabilized zoom lense.  So, it can capture good images.  What to do about the noise?Many people post process their digital photos.  The programs Neat Image and Noise Ninja are widely cited, and many reviewers indicated that Neat Image does a good job of cleaning up the FZ7's noisy images.  Noise Ninja appears to be faster but more expensive.Thus, if you are going to post process your images anyway (Photoshop Elements 4.0 is one good way to do that), you can invest another $50-$75 or so to get one of these de-noise programs or plug-ins. Photoshop Elements 4.0 itself has a de-noising function built in, although it appears not to be as sophisticated as that of the plug-ins. If you're willing to take the time, it appears that the FZ7 with noise removal processing can produce really good images, even large ones.  I have yet to see, but am optimistic.

I've accidently whacked it a few times with no harm.3) It has a variable diopter viewfinder.  Good for glasses wearers.  Some don't.Now the (minor) bad things about the camera.1)  The viewfinder, though better than most, is not as bright or as high resolution as the Kodak P850.  The Kodak also has a better view in low light conditions.  The P850 is also available for considerable less money, although some think it takes slightly inferior pics.  Night pictures with this camera are almost an act of faith unless you are in range of the LED.2) You won't find a backlight setting in the Program mode.  You have to adjust the exposure compensation click by click.  I like a single button option for fast compensation.  It is available in the simple mode, which does 90% of what I want anyway, but I use the Program mode most and I think most techie, non pros will too.3) No AA battery option.  I want to take it on travel and camping.  It would be nice to be freed of the plug.4) The Aperture and Shutter priority mode are a mystery to me.  And yes, I've read the manual a few times.  You still have to adjust to get the proper exposure.  That's not how I recall it working in my old Ricoh 35mm SLR.Beyond these caveats, I have taken some spectacular pictures that people really notice.  Sports mode does great for kids sports.  And when  you press the shutter, the camera takes a picture!!  At that moment!!

This is my second digital camera, after the low-end but generally well-regarded Canon A510.  This camera is a definite step up in size and price, but I'm not entirely satisfied with it.  While the overall picture quality is undeniably better than the 510, I think the very large amount of noise almost kills the FZ7.  This camera shows noise even at ISO 80 and 100, is barely usable at ISO 200, and is kind of a joke at ISO 400.  The ISO 800 & 1600 modes are fun for taking snapshots in dark areas, but are comparable to a camera-phone in quality.The noise problem is mitigated by the excellent image stabilization (which helps by two steps - or being able to use ISO 100 in ISO 400 situations, which is probably a more realistic way to think of it), but only partially.  The camera also has occasional issues with purple fringing and poor automatic white balance.  Finally, the large display is very low-resolution, and given to weird moray effects.On the positive side, it's an excellent lens (which is rather fast, especially on the long end of the zoom), the user interface is rather efficient and easy to use, the build quality is excellent, it feels comfortable in the hand, and it's substantially cheaper than the similar Canon S3.  The size is compact enough that it can be squeezed into a pants pocket and definitely fits into a jacket pocket, which greatly increases the chances that I'll take it with me.Personally, though, while I enjoy using this camera, I think the image quality is only half a step up from pocket-size cameras, and can't even compete with an entry-level DSLR.", "Date": "September 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Quite a Suprise!", "Author": "Gregory S. Brown", "ReviewID": "R1X9UEIJ2WAD8J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a camera for a trip to South Colorado/Northern New Mexico.  I read the reviews on Amazon and decided on this one (although I bought it locally due to time constraints).This camera does not dissapoint!  A lot of features and a lot of performance for the money.  Very intuitive to use, all buttons easy to locate and push.  I love the 2.5\" LCD screen and the viewfinder works well in sunny areas.  Best of all the sunscreen really works to block the sun.  It is very lightweight.  Good battery life with proprietary battery--would have preferred AA's--and that is truly my only complaint with this camera.  I bought an extra battery to use with the encloed charger and had no problems switching back and forth.  Also bought a 1G card which allowed approx 375 photographs.I did some cool artsy shots of crumbling adobe walls and vistas with the manual controls that are also easy to navigate.  Got some great wildlife shots too: the camera turns on and is ready to go in two seconds (I just counted).  The zoom works quickly.  With the digital zoom it goes to 48X with some degradation that the manual takes pains to warn you about.  Zoom up to 12x and steady on a car or your buddy and you will get some great shots.So. . .miles ahead of any pocket camera out there.  I certainly would not compare it to any true SLR in price and versatility.  It is really an intermediate step between the two.  For those that want more quality than a pocket camera, but don't want to invest in an SLR this is a real contender.  I really cannot think of a single serious criticism of this camera.", "Date": "June 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Incredible Camera for the Price", "Author": "Marty", "ReviewID": "RFM6OIZ4X0UAB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Panasonic DMC-FZ7 is a very nice upgrade from the DMC-FZ5 it replaced, at a much lower cost! It really is amazing how these electronic devices get better and cheaper in a very short time.The camera takes great pictures, and is easy to handle. It operates quickly and comes with a lithium ion rechargable battery that is good for around 300 shots, which is more than you'll probably ever need in one outing. [...]. It wasn't made by Panasonic (that battery costs around [...]) but it works identically to the OEM battery. The camera uses SD memory cards which are pretty common today and easy to find.This camera, like all superzooms, is best when used outdoors. Nature photography, landscapes, and anything where there is plenty of light comes out great. The weakness of cameras with a long zoom range is indoor available light shooting, because the compromises needed in making such a powerful lens in a small package. The lens simply isn't fast enough for indoor, low light or available light shooting. However, if you use the flash this won't be a problem. A tripod would also help. But it should be noted that this problem exists for any superzoom camera, not just this one.The lens itself is beautiful... Leica designed, and Panasonic built. it provides sharp, well saturated pictures with very little distortion except at the extreme high end of the zoom range. I didn't detect any major purple fringing problem.Panasonics use a relatively small image sensor, which is needed to keep the camera size and weight down. So, this camera like all Panasonics, is often said to have \"High (image) noise over 200 ISO.\" And this is true, but it is hardly noticable unless you make huge enlargements or shoot over 400 ISO. Also, if you do find any noise, it is easily removed by Photo Shop or Print Shop software. I suspect this problem isn't that easy to engineer out in small sensor cameras, or Panasonic would have done it by now.Panasonic's OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) system works extremely well. It is built into the lens, and actually moves the elements to compensate for camera shake. This becomes a critical issue for long focal lenght zoom lenses. Note... unlike some manufacturers, Panasonic uses a REAL stabilization system. This isn't a program that merely raises the ISO to increase the shutter speed, but an actual anti-shake correction, just like the high end Canon L series IS lenses have.Here are the improvements Panasonic made over the FZ5 with this new FZ7:1. 6MP rather than 5MP2. 2.5 inch LCD screen rather than 2.0 inch screen3. Better, longer lasting battery4. Threaded front lens element to accept filters5. Better movie resolution (TWICE as good)6. Lens cap attaches to camera, so it's hard to lose7. Able to take 16:9 ratio pictures8. Can shoot above ISO400 (but 800 and 1600 are lower resolution)9. 60 sec min shutter rather than 8 secAll for around [...] FZ5 which was only released 11 months before the FZ7!Overall, this is a great camera that will please any casual shooter or advanced amatuer. It does a lot in a very small package, for a very reasonable price. Pros will be disappointed by it's low light results and noise problems at higher ISO's. But, if you are a professional photographer, you wouldn't even consider one of these cameras. You'd be using a Digital SLR, and hauling around 50 pounds worth of gear!Given the rapid technological advances made in these cameras, I refuse to spend [...] for a camera that will be obsolete in 3 years.

Ergonomically it may resemble a digital SLR only in the sense that its controls are easy to reach and use. Like other recent Panasonic Lumix cameras, this one has a superb image stabilization feature for handholding under low light conditions or fast-paced action shots with an equivalent film speed of up to ISO 1600! In plain English, this is the perfect little digital camera for taking pictures under almost every condition imaginable, with an ample power supply from its Lithium battery. The Leica-designed, Panasonic-built zoom lens offers exceptional image quality. I personally like this camera's silver finish, which reminds me a lot of classic 35mm Leica M rangefinder cameras like the Leica M3, M2 and M4. But better yet, this superzoom digital camera isn't as expensive as a Leica M rangefinder camera; surely at its current low price, it's the best bang for the buck with regards to features and image quality.", "Date": "May 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "all the camera I need", "Author": "Richard Sears", "ReviewID": "R32W3Q6O7IH6EJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a newcomer to digital photography. My first camera was a little Nikon 100 that was not bad for its day, but would be about equivalent to a cell phone camera today. From there, I graduated to a 2.1 mp Fujipix that took very decent pictures until I dropped it on cement in Croatia. (It still takes decent pictures, but the lens cover is a tad floppy.) My companion had a 3.1 mp Canon that was tiny enough to put in a pocket easily, which seemed like a good idea. I bought a similar sized Konica/Minolta that took great pictures, but many of them included parts of my fingers that got in front of the lens. My companion's Canon just suddenly died, so I gave her my K/M which was really more her size. I'm a large person, and my ham hands needed something more substantial.I started looking at digital slr's, but the added cost and the added inconvenience of carrying around a bunch of specialty lenses turned me off. For about half the price all the major brand names offered 6+ mp cameras with lenses that were eqiuvalent to 35-400mm lenses in 35mm cameras. Reviews on all seemed flattering, so choosing was hard. I cut Canon because I had heard other people complain about sudden death in their cameras. Among the others, I let price guide me, and the Lumix was the least expensive by about $25My first real test of the camera came last month on a trip through the Southwest. The results are amazing. I'm 75 years old, with hands no longer as steady as they once were, and I took a number of hand-held 12x telephoto shots that are razor sharp. Panasonic's stabilizer is unbelieveably efficient. I've had a couple of photos professionally printed as 8\"x10\"s, and the results are as good as anything I've ever done with my old Minolta slr film camera.One concern I had to begin with was the rechargeable lithium battery. Carrying a recharger seemed more inconvenient than replacement AA batteries, especially since I do a lot of travel in Europe where everything requires a voltage converter. Not to worry; after more than 180 shots the battery still reads fully charged.I notice from the offerings in Amazon that Lumix has an updated version, the DMC-F27K that seems to be the same camera but with an additional 1.2 mp. If that makes a difference to you, go for it. I'd rather take the additional $25 cost and put it toward a 2 gig memory stick. Great pictures (with no finger parts), simple operation with almost unlimited options, incredible stablization, Panasonic quality electronics, and Leica glass -- what's not to like?", "Date": "April 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Almost the best in class: 12x optical zoom @ 6MP", "Author": "The WHO \"The WHO\"", "ReviewID": "RFUBC5AM0RIKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Price and Battery Life: 5 starI bought this camera from Amazon for a very good price. A few days thereafter, Amazon lowered the price on this camera, and I got some more discount! The camera comes with a rechargeable battery (with recharger) - which I find more useful than having to replace 4AA batteries (some other cameras require). I have had this camera for more than 2 weeks now, and have recharged the battery for every 200-300 pictures. I did notice that taking more pictures at night or indoor that require flash - would consume the battery faster - but then what other camera does not. I wanted a black camera - to look professional. This camera comes with 16Mb Memory Card, so I bought a 1Gig Memory Card from Radioshack for $24.Shooting Modes: 4.5 starThe camera has a lot of modes - and I have tried every one of them - I must say - the modes are there for a reason. i.e. if you know exactly what type of picture you are trying to take - better switch to that mode - and you will be impressed with the picture this camera takes compared to the default mode. I think this is where this camera probably comes second to Cannon S3 (12x OZ w/ 6MP). But then this camera sells for almost $100 less than a Cannon S3. Also don't buy a Cannon S2, but this one. I have found the Program AE mode very useful, in this mode I could use the joystick next to the LCD to override settings manually, e.g. increase/decrease aperture. This camera also has a built in optical image stabilization - which works slightly different compared to Cannon's. I noticed that the image stabilization is good at lower optical zooms. i.e. closer to 12x or particularly in digital zoom - this camera will appear to shake a lot in LCD/view finder - so theerfore use a tripod. An interesting observation - if you are taking a picture at very high zoom, most likely you are going to need to do a lot of focus - and typically tripod is always recommended.Picture Quality: 4.5 starUnless you are a professional photographer or someone who shoots pictures to print to A4 or larger prints - common man would not have any complaints with the niose at high ISO (>200) or shooting indoors in auto mode (i.e. high sensitivity mode). So before buying this camera I did a lot of research, especially at dpreview.com and also found comments by other user at Amazon.com useful..where also it was mentioned about more noise by all Panasonic cameras at high ISOs. So here is what I found useful to get around the inherent more noise: use noise reduction software or use lower ISO (i.e. ISO 100 indoors); I have not seen issues with noise when shooting outdoors even at high ISOs - provided plenty abmient light.Finally, I suggest reading the manual before starting to shoot pictures.

Fuselier", "ReviewID": "R3BMH7PRDM5675", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently bought this for myself.  This is a spectacular camera.  Once you get to know a superzoom lens, it's hard to imagine ever settling for a 3x or 4x zoom again.  It gives you so much flexibility for framing images and, together with the wide aperture capability of this camera, controlling the depth of field.  The lens is really a gem.Picture quality is magnificent in natural light.  Really, outdoor pictures have been technically wonderful (if only I had the skill to compose nice images to take advantage of the quality!).  The camera's automatic exposures are generally spot-on, but all of the important tweaks are right at your fingertips, once you learn the controls - no deep menu hunting with this camera.  It is full-featured in the truest sense.In good light, I have no problems with image noise all the way through ISO400.  Sure, you can see some noise at 200 and 400 if you look for it, but no worse (and I think slightly better) than the noise we used to get with Kodak and Fuji film at ISO 200 and 400.  If you do a little post-processing anyway, it's a snap to remove the noise with any number of software packages.Indoors, the camera performs as well or better than any other consumer-level camera with a flash.  This camera will not give you super-quality high-ISO flashless pictures, as many dSLR cameras can do.  But if you are using it to take snapshots with flash, you'll be very pleased.  The flash is quite powerful and redeye is a little better than you see with small cameras, since the flash is a bit further from the lens.One word on high ISOs:  This camera has a \"High Sensitivity\" mode in the scene menus.  Here, you can choose ISO 800 or 1600.  I have read a lot of really negative reviews on this.  After trying it, I don't undertand the complaint.  The camera applies a strong noise-reduction program to compensate for the noise that is generated at those levels.  As a result, the pictures are far softer and less detailed than the normal pictures you get.  However, Panasonic does not claim that they are as good.  They openly state that you get less resolution.  However, in my judgment, the results are quite satisfactory for printing normal 4x6 snapshots.  Perhaps a bit on the soft side, but perfectly good for casual family snapshooting needs.  If you are in a place where flash is forbidden, and it's the only way to get the picture, don't hesitate to try it.Bottom line:  You can get higher picture quality if you step up to a dSLR (and much better low-light high-ISO pictures).  But the cheapest dSLR costs more than twice what this camera costs.  And this comes with a 12x zoom of exceptional quality.  To build a similar SLR, you're going to get into four figures.

Then I bought an SD card and visited local stores to shoot with both the Canon and Panasonic under identical conditions. Differences in photo quality were minimal. If you have researched these cameras at all you have undoubtly seen reviews of softness in the Canon photos and I would agree. You have also surely seen reviews of noise issues in the Panasonic photos. I saw no more noise in the Panasonic than the Canon shooting the same subject in the same lighting and camera settings. Since I actually bought the Panasonic I have been able to get test shots in many lighting situations. Low light will lead to noise but this is common for any small sensor.

That being said, I class myself as intermediate user because I'm not afraid to try different modes to see what they do.This camera would be most useful to the intermediate user. It's a little more complicated than a point and shoot (but can certainly be used that way in \"Simple\" mode), but to simply use it as a point and shoot would be selling this phenomenal camera up short.Certainly, when you first open the package and insert the batteries (you need to charge them prior to use, they do not come with a charge. 120 minutes charge time) and the memory card (they give you a 16 MB. Get at least a gig SD card. It's cheap enough, and it'll hold a goodly amount of photographs), you'll want to start taking pictures in \"Simple\" mode (the heart setting on the dial). This will give you a pretty good idea of the generic picture quality.The other modes allow for more control. Priority Aperture is what I'm experimenting with now, which allows for me to adjust things like white balance and ISO sensitivity, and other things that can really make your photos pop in specific situations. Macro mode, for close ups, is absolutely wonderful. Though you can get great closeups in Simple mode, Macro mode will give you more control over the camera's interpretation of the environment.There is also a scene mode, video mode, and full manual modes.Picture quality: Wow. Granted, I upgraded from a 3.1 megapixel camera (albeit a very GOOD 3.1 MP camera). The colors are strikingly vivid, the lines are sharp and clear. Even with image stabilization (which helps a lot when zooming) I do sometimes jiggle the camera and get blurry, but with every new digital camera there's a learning curve with how much \"jiggling room\" you have.More striking, I can not get those demonic red eyes on ANY living thing in ANY photo I take. I love it.The 12x optical zoom is nice... I can identify bird species (small birds) in trees over 50 feet away. Better yet, the aforementioned image stabilization makes the pictures a lot steadier than they would be zooming alone, even without a tripod or a particularly steady hand.The only real cons to this camera are quite easy to live with. First, I wish it had a firewire connection, because connecting with USB is slow. Secondly, I wish there were a way to make it automatically upload in PC mode (you can upload to a PC or a PICTBRIDGE printer, and every time you upload the camera asks you which one you're uploading to. I don't have a photo printer, and it's just an extra button to press that I really don't want to have to EVERY time I upload.)Other extraneous thoughts: Camera works great in Linux, using the SVN libraries out of gphoto2, and Gthumb viewer. Plug it in and you're ready to go. It's recognized as a mass usb storage camera, but I imagine that will change over time and new drivers will be developed. The only problem with uploading in Linux is that it doesn't always delete the pictures off the camera afterwards.Shoulder strap is dorky. Wish it came with a hand/wrist strap as well. The camera is a little bulky, but for what it does, it's not at all unwieldly. The 16 MB SD card is, as others have mentioned, a joke. Get at least a gig. They're not expensive.Don't particularly like the feel of the lens cap and how it goes on, but it is solid, so I can't complain.All in all, for under $250 this is a wonderful camera for the amateur photographer.One more tip: Just purchased a small card USB card reader/2 gig card combination for this camera (there are a few manufacturers out there, I bought a Kingston combination pack very cheaply- under $20).

This is my 2nd digital camera and its quite a step up especially for a point and shoot. I have had several film SLR cameras and this cameras features rival and even surpass most of my older SLR's. The simple mode makes it easy for less experienced family members to use the DMC FZ7 too. The controls are relatively easy to master and makes the camera fun to experiment with. The 2.5\" LCD is huge, allowing you to easily share the picture before processing. I do quite a bit of nature photography and the 12X zoom with stabilization has not left me disappointed. The macro feature has helped me to produce the best macro pictures I have ever produced after only one month. The quality and resolution is quite amazing.

Outdoor pics are stunning. This camera puts out a lot of detail and color. Very little post processing (if any) is needed. The user interface is the best I've used in any camera to date. The joystick makes the normal operations very quick to perform. Great feature! The startup time is quick as well and the zooming function works great. The IS is very effective. With enough light you rarely get any blurring at full zoom. Specially in sports mode. The IS system really works great. The only grip I have with this camera is the screen resolution. It could be higher. However after reviewing the pics I've taken with this camera this is no longer an issue for me. And believe me I'm very anal when it comes to LCD screens. Also there is a small noise issue indoors on pics above Iso 200. But if you use the flash you dont have this problem.

Photos are sharp and the digital noise is not a problem in most situations.  In low light, noise is moderate in magnified photos on the computer, but no more so than other similar cameras, I'm told.  In comparing this camera to my old Panasonic DMC-FZ10 with 4MP, it seems that there is a bit more noise.  This is probably because of cramming so many more megapixils into the same sensor space. There are a ton of features, most of which I don't use, but all the buttons and dials are easy to figure out.  The instuction booklet is 130 pages long, but pretty easy to navigate.

I bought the DMC-FZ7 from Sears in March, 2006, on sale for $399.00 after doing research on Consumer Reports. At the time, it was totally bad-ass and cutting edge. It may not be cutting edge in '11, but it's still bad-ass. I'm astonished that after five and a half years, this camera is actually selling for more on Amazon than that sale price at Sears. Or am I? To be honest, I haven't treated it that well and yet it keeps performing and making me look good. I get incredibly crisp photos, even on super-zoom (fantastic optical zoom); my friends who have $1,000 + cameras assume I have a similar camera. Yet this one is small, easily carried, easy to use, with a great battery life. It's also relatively rugged: I lost the lens cap almost immediately (by the end of the summer in '06) because I didn't tie it to the camera with the included lanyard, and yet the Leica lens (a huge plus) nor the body of the camera, not its parts, were ever damaged. I was relatively careful -- I never dropped it -- but I did store it in my duffel bag, slung it on the floor of my car, and packed it in airplane carryons on many vacations to no ill effect. (I finally got a new lens cap from PartStore a month ago before I went to Ireland.) About a month ago, the included rechargeable battery started to fail (only held a charge for a couple of hours, vs. a couple of days as it usually does with frequent use.) After over 5 years, I thought that was more than okay. This camera is easy to use -- my only recommendation is that in bright light, even when overcast, it's a good idea to use the included \"hood\" or else things get very contrasty on \"simple\" use (manual settings might well change that, but I've never had to use them). Everything about this camera works great; it's easy to use, its photos are amazing, and it has stood the test of time.

Great customer service there, by the way.Pros - Good battery life. I can go a couple hundred pictures without charging the battery. Coming from my old AA digital camera that ate my batteries like air, this was quite a relief. I would still recommend another battery, just in case. You never want to be caught without one. The cheap alternative is on Amazon. Panasonic DLP-006 Equivalent Digital Camera Battery- Good accessories. I love the wall outlet charger for the battery. Not all cameras come with one, and you get one for free! You also get a lens hood and an adaptor. You can use the adaptor for 52mm filters. Panasonic makes you think you need to buy the 55m lens adaptor for everything, but you only need that if you want to buy the extra lens. Do yourself a favor, buy a UV protector to put over your lens.-Zoom. The zoom is great! You can really outshine all your friends with their compact 3x optical zoom with your 12x zoom! If you turn your mega pixels to 3mp, you get 14.7x zoom! Great when you need that extra boost.-Great scene modes. Personally, I use manual mode as much as possible, but if you need a quick picture, just switch! The baby mode is a cute idea, great for mothers! Also, they have manual, aperture priority, shutter priority, program, and simple mode. You can also take videos. They aren't the best quality, but if you need to catch the moment, it's great.- Great overall feel. Yes, it's a little bulkier than the average compact camera - but this is not the average compact camera! Just buy a bag for it, and you're set. You can't believe how light it is for it's size! My friend had a Canon that was 2 years old. It was smaller, but TONS heavier.- Controls are easy to navigate. Almost everything can be moved by your right thumb. Zoom is used by right index finger.-Price. Cheaper than similar models from other companies. Great for people who want good quality, but don't want to dish out the money.Cons - Bad ISO. You really can't get around it. I have heard that other similar cameras have the same problem, but it really is bad about 400 and higher. Use the high sensitivity mode only if you absolutely need the picture, and you don't care about the quality. Around 800 and 1600 it looks more like cell phone quality because of all the noise.- The speed of the lens. This is something that Panasonic addressed in the newer model, FZ8. I just find myself wishing the lens would zoom and unzoom faster than it does. You would find this especially true if you are trying to photograph a sport like Soccer.-No internal memory. Make sure you ALWAYS have an SD card or two on hand. Buy a new one, the 16mb one is a joke.-This is just a personal preference, but I wish the scene modes were more accessible, perhaps on the dial. It's not a huge deal, I normally shoot in manual.-Again, just a personal preference, but I wish it came with a wrist strap rather than a neck strap. Nothing to freak out about, just something I wish..Even though I had a few cons, I still rate this camera at 5 stars. The only glaring con is the ISO speed. Most people would buy a bigger SD card anyway. Buy at least a gig.Overall, this camera is great! Great for the money, quality, everything! Obviously, this isn't for a professional, but it exceeds what most people have for cameras.

The present modes are special situations are time saver, but I hoped that they could be reached from a separate dial, instead of diving into the menu.Download the new pictures to the computer is a breeze. Just plug the camera and the software will recognize it and download the new pictures and movies to the computers. The clips and the pictures are saved by their time stamp, and they are saved in folders labeled by the dates they were taken in. Being unable to modify this, or name the pictures, like 'my daughter on her wooden elephant.jpg' on the camera very annoying. Because I only download the pictures when they approach the capacity limit of the SD card (4GB), and by then they would be dozens of them (if not hundreds) and of course I won't remember which was 'my daughter on her wooden elephant'. Also, I can't save them into folders by occasions on the camera, like work, home, weekend, Amazon product reviews...etc The closest is saving them as travel story; The camera gives the option to collect a group of pictures by a specific period, starting from a departure date and arrival date that you have to set. Even with this, you'll see pictures saved in folders as 'first day, second day..etcPreviewing the stored images and clips on the TV is great except for the navigation controls. It is just basic, and could be much better, allowing  for example, selecting non-sequential photos, sorting files into images and clips, using more than one marking to mark different groups of images like 1, 2, 3 or H,W,WE or Home, Work, Week end..etc, and preview each gallery alone. This is very important if you have private photos among work photos, and you want to hide them from colleagues. Because of this, I carry two SDs, one for my private family and another for my public friends and word photos and clips.Otherwise, it's fairly fast and video clips are limited in length only by the SD capacity.The photos are crisp and great, but not extremely professionalThe videos are great for family occasions, but of course a VGA movie at 15 frames/sec cannot compete with camcoders and SLRs. VGA movies at 30 Frames are available, and they are smoother, but they heavily tax the SD capacity. I find the 15 frames a good compromise, and unless you are shouting a very fast moving person (like my daughter sometimes) it's fairly enough for most cases.The camera is not bulky but still big.

This is one reason I think a lot of people are attracted and eventually buy the Panasonic Lumix cameras. This camera is an upgrade from a previous Lumix I had - the DMC-FZ5K. The specs are basically a carry-over from the FZ5 except for 2 highlight features - a higher resolution (from 5MP to 6.1MP) and a feature that everybody was screaming to have - the manual mode. On the control side, there is now a joy stick where you can change a variety of settings (one is to configure the resolution you want to have). The OIS or Optical Image Stabilizer works great with people who have shaky hands. It can be set on 2 different modes depending on the degree of shakiness. Overall it is one heck of a good camera.

I spend a lot of time in Photoshop these days, and will likely replace it with a Canon instead of another Lumix.", "Date": "February 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "BEST BUY", "Author": "Andre Estrella", "ReviewID": "R2J11OHK84R7VE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera, because that were a good price vs tecnology.I see many cameras and I choose this because the good reviews that I read.I am in love with this camera, easily to use, many effects, tecnology and best results...I recommend ever", "Date": "January 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very frustrating - updated", "Author": "Eden \"Pixie\"", "ReviewID": "R39E5LT4WAZ1Y5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We've had this camera for about 3 years now so I want to update my previous review.  I would say it is a very good camera for more experienced photographers.  However, the pre-set modes make it easy for amateurs to also take excellent photos.  The \"Scenic\" mode captures incredible outdoor images while the simple point-and-shoot (heart) option works well in most settings.The camera is fanastic for outdoor landscape and travel shots.  But very tricky for indoor and portrait shots.  I'm still having trouble in lower light settings.One last thing:  the flash is simply way too bright, and I have not figured out how to adjust the brightness yet.___________Previous review:Perhaps you need to be a professional photographer to successfully use this camera.  We've had it for 2 months, and have tried nearly every setting and scene mode, with image stabilization.  I would say only about 30% of the pictures we've taken were passable.  Most are quite blurry.  How difficult can it be to take a clear picture??  And we haven't even attempted to print out yet - the clarity is a problem even with web pics.Here's the real frustration.  We attempted to take an indoor photo for our annual christmas card.  Snapped about 40 different shots, mainly using the High Sensitivity setting, some with flash, some without.  Many using burst mode.  At the end of the day, we did not get one acceptable picture, though the few we shot using the flash were much clearer.I do wonder if there is something major we are doing wrong - not focusing correctly?  We'll continue to read the manual and online forums, but if we cannot fix the problem, this camera is going back.We had an Olympus Super-Zoom camera (without image stablization) that took incredible photos, without much effort.  I'm very disappointed in this one so far.", "Date": "December 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Panasonic DMC-FZ7 6MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)", "Author": "Anhtuan Phan", "ReviewID": "RZR16VSLXWKU0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I returned the camera.

It is bulky and clumsy. We got the Panasonic DMC-FZ7 Lumix as a gift and we are so disappointed.  You need to buy a special close-up lens to take clear photos of flowers.  Our cheap Canon took close-up photos like a champion!Both the 12X zoom and close-up settings are useless because the photos are blurred.  We have read the manual, used all the proper settings, and have tried other possible settings to discover the \"magic solution\" to good photos.  All we accomplished was wearing out the batteries.The photos average maybe one clear photo out of 5.  I can't help but wonder where the previous positive reviews came from. I do notice that most reviewers state that they need to \"get used to the camera\".  Maybe they are having similar problems with this 'simple, self-focusing' camera.Our Canon Powershot could make a sharp photograph the fuzz on a bee's backside without getting stung.

More megapixels, more zoom, image stabilization... it all sounded good.But after taking a number of sample pictures, I'm disappointed, and the camera is going back. I even read the manual... yes... I went that far... and reduced the image size, but I took a pile of pictures under various lighting conditions (in Easy mode), and the pictures just didn't seem that significantly better than that of my Kodak. (I took pictures side by side of the same things.) I will use advanced features from time to time, but honestly, if it's supposed to function well in Easy mode and it doesn't, that's a lost sale for me.Yes, the LCD is huge, but the small LCD on my Kodak is much crisper and brighter. The display on the FZ7 is so grainy that it's hard to see what I'm photographing.  I also don't like that I have to push a switch to toggle between viewfinder and LCD, instead of having both available simultaneously.I also told myself that I really wouldn't mind moving from Easyshare, but you know what? After fiddling with this camera for a day, I miss simply docking the camera to recharge it or transfer pictures. Kodak got that right, at least for this customer. I also agree that not being able to use regular batteries in a pinch is a drawback. The first point is not so much Panasonic's problem, it's a preference; the second point is more universal.On the other hand, the camera seems well-made, it's attractive, it has a nice grip, the buttons and toggles are all well placed, the lens cap is intelligently designed (you won't lose it unless you're trying to), and overall this camera seems to offer a number of features that are nice for this price range. I feel bad giving the DMC-FZ7 this review, because I had a Panasonic film camera for 17 years (it didn't break, I lost it in 2004) and it took many, many wonderful pictures. I was hoping to resume being a Panasonic camera fan. Darn.
