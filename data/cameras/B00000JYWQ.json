Ball", "ReviewID": "R31UI7NBD4CRBV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Since I bought this camera in July, I have run over 800 exposures through it.  The Coolpix 950 takes some getting used to and the manuals are required reading, but this is a camera worth learning how to use. There are  two manuals, one printed and one on CD-ROM, plus the Getting Started sheet.  You need to look at all three; each contains information not present in  the other documents.The macro capability is phenomenal.  I have a  picture of a dime that fills most of the frame.  The ability to push the  sensitivity of the CCD to ISO 400 and to overexpose by up to two f/stops  allows even night pictures by available street light.  The enhanced speed  (at some cost in picture quality) also allows candids by available light.  The Coolpix is also quiet in operation, even quieter if you shut off the  discreet beeper that tells you that you have taken a shot.On the down  side, you will have to spring for rechargeable batteries.  I have gotten by  so far with NiCd batteries plus a fast recharger.  A ribbon on your lens  cap is also highly recommended.  I have also been having some trouble  lately with my off-record-play switch, and there is some barrel distortion  and color fringing in the lens at its wide-angle setting.  The lens' focus  at its landscape setting also seems a little questionable at high  magnification.  I also wish that the manual focus settings weren't so  coarse and that it were possible to do a completely manual exposure.  (You  can set either the shutter speed or the aperture manually, but not both  simultaneously.)  There is a noticeable delay between pushing the button  and actually getting an exposure.  This is sometimes a problem for candids  and sports photography and when working with animals, but I have still  gotten successful pictures in all these categories, and the Coolpix is  faster than most digital cameras in this respect.Other than these few  small problems, I am happy with the quality of the pictures I have been  getting, and it is small enough for me to carry on my belt for instant  access.  I could never carry a standard 35 mm camera with similar  capability around like that.  The Coolpix seems to be holding up well  mechanically, even though it gets bumped now and again.  (The extra  batteries do get a little lumpy when I sit down, though!)", "Date": "November 17, 1999"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but be prepared", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2CUJ15PSM1L8E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been taking and developing pictures for nearly 50 years. The Coolpix 950 is my second digital. It's truly one of the greats with plenty of creative features. The macros are impressive, with distances less than an  inch. The Coolpix requires lots of time understanding the many buttons,  wheels and software driven features. It seems to me that the Nikon computer  people and their mechanical people could have made it easier for the user.  The available user instructions from Nikon, including their CD ROM  versions, could have been much better designed, even for old photography  buffs. Their technical service phone number is a toll call and I got busy  signals THREE times even after I connected with their menu-driven answering  machine. Their website tech help is very good, but not if you are in a  hurry. The camera is a major user of power so you will need long lasting  batteries like NiMH. I bought a rechargable ProPower Pack from Unity  Digital for $100 that lasts a considerable time. I'd rate the camera itself  a 5-star and the support and user help a 3-star, for an average of 4-stars.", "Date": "November 25, 1999"}, {"Title": "A Hassle but Worth It", "Author": "AFRED \"Allyka\"", "ReviewID": "R1UJWMUBGCH746", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use this camera with a usb sans disk flashcard reader, which I find incredibly convenient. I email pictures to family regularly.  The quality is matchless, but I have to ramp down the resolution and size or some files  can be over 1 meg. The quality is so exquisite, that (get this) got a  color matched fabric from a friend in NY based on a close up picture I took  of a printed upholstery piece.  I took a closeup of a diseased mahonia  leaf, emailed it to my mom, and she diagnosed thrips and suggested  BT.This is a camera with more capability than I need, but the picture  quality and features are worth developing the patience to deal with the  online manual and learn.  I print pics on a HP722 and the prints look  great. (Tho the color degrades after a year. Printer ink problem, not  Camera)However, it has a few shortcomings. The paperless manual is a  pain when you are learning.  You just CANNOT see the lcd screen on the  camera in bright light which makes using the manual settings impossible.  The add on lenses (wide angle, etc) are awkward to use. I have lost more of  the tiny lens caps than I will confess.

Get a Nikon 950!", "Author": "College Professor", "ReviewID": "RZ08SV56MF08S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Background: I have had a 35mm SLR camera for years and was a weekend photographer. I knew  that to quicker exposure times on bright days, that I needed to turn the f-stop to a higher number, for  example. I took time exposures by mounting the camera on a tripod  with a remote shutter release...I  knew some times, but was  hardly a professional! Basic stuff.  I spent about 4 weeks  reading every review I could find on 2 megapixel digital cameras. It came  down to several options.  First, several  people tried to convince me to get a Kodak DC280 running about $400. I  didn't.  Why? Because it offers very little manual control  over the camera and Kodak appears to oversaturate  the colors  too much.  Second, I looked at the Nikon Coolpix 800 for  about $400 too. I didn't get it. I went to Best Buy's  several times a week and played with the CP800. The picture quality is  fantastic (see some of the  review websites), but it only had  a 2X zoom and offered manual focusing. It did not allow shutter or  apeture priority.  Third, I decided on the Nikon 950.  I missed out on some of the lowest prices on this back in  Mid-April, but found I could get it from Amazon.com for about $570 after  rebate. I avoided some of  the online stores with bad ratings  on the resellerratings.com website.  Why the 950? Well, I  have had it for about 5 days now and KNOW I made the right choice. Out of  the bag, it takes great pictures under an amazing list of  situations in automatic mode. But...there is  so much  more!  Yesterday, I took it with me to my son's soccer  game. I wanted to take some action shots. In  automatic mode,  all action was blurred. :-( But, I put the 950 into shutter priority mode,  set it to take  pictures at 1/500th of a second (it was  bright daylight), and all action is stop-action. It's great!  I've also used it to take pictures of the moon by placing the 950 on a  tripod and positioning the lens  against my telescope  eyepiece. I used shutter priority mode with exposures of 1/30, 1/60, and  1/125  of a second again. Pictures are stunning. I would not  have been able to do this with the 800 or the  Kodak.  How to get pictures into the computer? If you have a laptop with a  PC card slot, buy a compact flash  adapter for about $10. If  you have a computer with a USB port, buy a compact flash reader to plug  into it (I got mine for about $25). It allows 8MB of pictures to  be transferred to the computer in  about 10 seconds. No  waiting an hour for them to come over the serial port for me!  If you can afford to get the 950, do so. Also try to get some  rechargeable batteries, a compact flash  reader and a bigger  compact flash card.   Strengths: Great pictures in  automatic mode. Ability to set the shutter speed. Good zoom.  Weaknesses: Buy a NIMH charger and some NIMH batteries (there are places  that sell these on ebay  fairly cheap...I got 12 of these  1500Mah for $22). The included 8MB compactflash card is small.  Buy a bigger one. Similar Products Used: Have had a Quicktake 150 and a  Kodak DC50.", "Date": "May 16, 2000"}, {"Title": "Buy one!  But you can't buy mine!", "Author": "PT Phil \"bajaphil\"", "ReviewID": "R2M8TMAE721DWX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is the digital equivalent to a some of the fine utility film cameras such as Canons' Rebel and \u00c9lan EOS series: The camera is just as complex as you need it to be - whether you are a `point-and-shoot' user or  a need it for professional uses.  In my design business use it has far  exceeded my expectations.Prior to purchasing the 950, I would  take a product shot, make a print and tape it onto my monitor where I used  it as reference to draw the product into an on screen graphic.  With this  camera, I seldom print the `film' out at all - in fact in many cases I  didn't even have to redraw the product in at all.  A shade-tree calculation  says that this camera has saved me well over 100 hours in the three months  I have owned it.  Even at my low-low rates this is several times the cost  of this camera - even including the optional memory. The  resolution is high enough for everyday publication uses -- print or pixel.  A caveat here: the lens does not collect enough light to do studio quality  photography.  For this reason in most high quality still photo work it is  useful to use a tripod to keep the camera steady.  The `speed' of the  camera is roughly equivalent to ASA 100 film.While it takes  only a few moments to discover the basics for `point-and-shoot' mode it is  worth a few hours practice in the `pro' mode.  Few of the `advanced'  features are really difficult to understand and using them once or twice is  so rewarding that learning becomes an easy and fun process - especially  since you can erase the film and use it over!  With careful lighting I  can come very close to studio quality work which compares to my yeoman  Canon EOS \u00c9lan 35mm. Particularly handy for me is the macro  mode - or close-up mode.  You can focus from less than an inch!  I  sometimes use it over my high-test scanner for documents because it is  easier and faster.  My partner (whose mechanical ability allows the use of  the toaster correctly 7 out of 10 times) uses it for online auctions and  has found it to be a blessing: she no longer shuns putting up the low cost  items due to the difficulty of getting an image.  She is still using the  point and shoot modes but they are more than good enough for this use. Notes and recommendations: Even a casual user will find the  need to have more than the supplied 8-megabyte chip.  I have a 64 and it is  more than enough.  Probably an additional  8- or 16-megabyte would do for  average use.  Uploading pictures using what is in the box is  straightforward but cumbersome and requires a serial port.  For not too  much money you can get a serial or USB drive that makes the CompactFlash  chip into a drive - plug the chip in and using explorer or your photo  software you can retrieve your photos just like any file on your computer.  (We have even used it to move non-photo programs from one `puter to  another!)  Please note that I have skipped over many features which have  bee covered admirably by the other reviewers on this page.In  this fast-moving technological era it is difficult to make a decision to  buy as there is another camera coming out in the near future.  However,  this camera will work for me for a long time and I recommend it to anyone  from the family album user to photo professionals for everyday use.  With  the new online services that will make you paper prints from your uploaded  images there are fewer and fewer reasons for cumbersome film and this  camera is one of the first to deliver print-quality resolution.", "Date": "January 13, 2000"}, {"Title": "Impressive pictures, easy to use, kids love it", "Author": "karen/suzanne \"CSS patient\"", "ReviewID": "R26ZYPZDWRA4CZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Our coolpix 950 came in the evening before thanksgiving.  Once we figued out how to get the battery case opened (manuals are usually the last thing that I read), we were off and running taking pictures.  The whole camera  was rather intuitive and I was thrilled with the ease of downloading the  pictures to my G4.  We had also purchased a USB Film reader with the  camera.  We were surprized by how quickly the batteries ran out (about 1.5  hours of use) but have quickly ordered rechargable batteries.  This I can  see as the only downside of taking this camera on a long trip.  We now have  to pack a battery charger and always kep an extra set of batteries on us.  Picture quality was amazing clear (I could easily pick out the discolored  grout on my kitchen counter).  And I am VERY picture about photo quality!  Currently taking pictures that are 440k in size.  I printed up a picture  (epson color 900 printer) of my thanksgiving turkey and pasted in on my  fridge - a few people have asked me what magazine I cut the picture  from....  very impressive.

Previously, I had owned a Nikon 35 MM \"point-and-shoot\" camera, but was interested in the advantages a  digital camera would provide;  immediate gratification through seeing your  pictures NOW, the ability to send JPG images to freinds and relatives, the  ability to delete pictures \"on-the-fly\", etc.  What I got was a  mixed bag of results - mostly positive.Before I go any further, I must  advise you to get the following options:  two sets of rechargable NiMH  batteries which should be standard with the camera (I use the Kodak ones  available at Amazon.com), a higher-capacity memory card (I use a 128 MB San  Disk - Nikon's OEM), and some sort of adapter to transfer your images  quickly - the serial cable is just too slow.  I have purchased a SanDisk  adapter and insert the memory card directly into the PCMCIA slot on my  laptop computer for rapid transfer.Anyways, in use the camera is  fantastic.  Initially, I was using the 640X480 resolution setting to save  space, but with the new, larger card, I now use the 1600X1200 setting with  moderate compression for all pictures.  I find that the card can hold about  100 pictures at this resolution.  Once I find a picture I like, I use the  Microsoft Photo Editor software (comes with Office) and reduce the  resolution as appropriate (web pages, etc.).  I store my  \"keepers\" on CDROM at the higher resolution - you can always  reduce resolution and size.The picture quality is great.  The flash,  however, should only be used up to 10' - any further and your pictures come  out too dark.  Nikon USA has a web page with the latest firmware available  for download - which I recommend.Low points for the camera include the  fact that the lens resets to full zoom every time you turn the camera off!  I find myself zooming out every time I turn the camera on - this eats up  your batteries and takes time.  The flap that covers the memory card does  not always stay closed and flops open from time to time.  Sometimes, the  camera takes a while to reset between pictures, so a bit of spontaneity is  lost.There are now newer cameras out there.  I find that the 2.1  Megapixel capability of this camera meets my needs and that, given the  recent price reductions, I would buy this Nikon now if I were in the market  today.", "Date": "May 24, 2000"}, {"Title": "Best Digital Camera Going", "Author": "Thomas R.

The imaging is astounding.  I could read the numbers on football players on a T.V. in the background, of a dimly lit  bar.  I read the reviews in P.C. Mag which said if you want 35mm quality  you had to have a camera with 2.1 megapixels, but this baby exceeds the  quality of a 35mm.  Two things though, The software leaves a lot to be  desired, and the flash ram is way to small if you want high quality  pictures in any quantity.  The 8 megabyte flash ram that comes with the  camera will give you 8 high quality pictures.  But if you boost it (we  bought an  80 megabyte flash ram by SanDisk which is totally compatible)  you'll be able to take more pictures than you'll ever need or want.  We  went to Paris in June and took over 300 pictures (high quality), and the  Camera still had a couple of hundred left.  You probably don't need the 80  megabyte, but I think you would want the 32 megabyte.Also, while your at  it get yourself some AA rechargeable batteries (also high quality), because  you'll go through AA's like they are  going out of style.  People love to  see what you have taken in the little LCD screen and it really chews up the  batteries.  Also, the flash will use them up! If your going to use this as  a web publishing tool you couldn't find a better one.  I recommend that you  use a real digital imaging tool like Photoshop, or MS Imaging.  The flash  gives most people red eyes (real evil looking) and you'll need to brush  that out with a good imaging tool.  Also, you can magnify your images 2 or  3X's and not lose quality, and with a good imaging tool you can crop it,  lighten, darken, change color, and make thumbnails with a couple of clicks.  Hint:  Nikon View is cumberson to work with but you can speed up the  downloading by using it away from your browser. Load direct from file,  instead of from file open from browser then you can choose from the  thumbnails (right click the thumbnail, choose copy)then paste it into  Word,Powerpoint or Photoshop.

To print photos, we  bought the Olympus printer that Amazon \"recommends\" and found it  to be small and flimsy.  We returned it (as always a good Amazon return  experience!) and bought the HP PhotoSmart P1100 with duplexer.  The best  thing about this printer is that you can just pop the Compact Flash card  out of the camera and pop it into the printer, and HP's software is FAR  superior to the Nikon junk that comes with the CoolPix.  A few annoying  features: (1) the delay between when you press the shutter button and when  the camera finally takes the photo.

You can't be in a hurry to take a picture with this  camera.  Another negative is the considerable use of energy needed to take  the highest resolution photos. The 950 sucks energy from my NiMH batteries  at a surprisingly high rate. I bought a backup rechargable battery pack and  it goes fast too.

I have avoided the auto-everything camera's because I like controlling all of the creative process. Because of  this, it took me a while to get used to the menus and buttons, but it was  not hard. The Coolpix 950 still allows you to control the creative process  but I would recommend a good book on digital photography (such as Real  World Digital Photography) to get you started, especially if you're a film  junkie such as myself. Note: a memory card reader for your computer and  bigger CompactFlash cards will make the camera much more enjoyable as well  as rechargeable Ni-MH batteries. The first two replace your film and  processing budget. One nice thing is that you can instantly reuse the  memory card. Mistakes can be erased immediately and the same memory space  used for a better shot. A light steady tripod is also recommended as the  camera has a \"speed rating\" of ISO 80 and shutter speeds tend to  be slow without flash. If you must use flash, get an external unit as the  on board flash is too close to the lens and, as with all small cameras,  produces flat featureless images.

It's great! However, I would like to make the following recommendations.1) Get a couple sets of rechargeable NiMH batteries rated at 1500mah. The  alkalines I first used were good for about an hour. With the NiMH  batteries, I'm still shooting with the same batteries after more than 120  pictures, with no sign of drainage. Don't settle for the cheaper 600mah  NiMH batteries, spend the extra money and get the 1500mah rating. Also, I  recommend NiMH rather than NiCd, as the later is less environmentally  friendly. Radio Shack is selling a set of 4AA NiMH 1300mah batteries plus a  charging unit for $1 more than the price of the batteries alone. If you get  this, plus an extra set of 1500mah NiMH, you'll be all set.2) Get a 6VDC  800ma adapter, for use when downloading pictures to your computer. It will  give you a lot longer battery life. By the way you don't need the 6.5V  adapter Nikon recommends. 3) Don't use the LCD screen more than you have  to when running off batteries. Program the camera to keep the LCD screen  off by default. This can be done in M-REC mode. As far as I can tell M-REC  mode does everything A-REC mode does (including automatic focus and flash),  except A-REC mode forces the LCD screen on, so learn how to use the camera  and stay with M-REC. By the way, a quick peek at the LCD every now and then  is okay with the NiMH batteries, but don't leave the LCD on any longer than  you have to.4) Don't change picture resolutions unless the memory card  is empty. I've lost pictures doing this. If you want to shoot at a  different resolution, save the pictures first, then clear the memory card  and go from there.If you follow these suggestions, you'll find the  batteries last a LONG time, and you'll always take great pictures.Enjoy!", "Date": "June 12, 2000"}, {"Title": "High Cost - Disappointing Outcome", "Author": "Chicago Resident", "ReviewID": "R1UKJTVAL9F29X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased and returned the camera.  From an optical perspective and the quality of the images, quite a great camera. Considering the substantial cost, several items were very disappointing and caused me to return it on a  cost vs. benefit aspect:  1) The camera does not come with a recharger and  appropriate NiCad (or better) batteries. Regular alkaline batteries last  about 30 min. for normal use.  2) The connection to the PC requires a  serial port only. Would be a nice option to include USB hookup. My  computer's serial ports are all used for other devices.  3) An 8MB flash  card that holds a mere 16 images in the 'normal' mode. 4) When connected to  the PC, the pictures cannot be easily transferred to software programs that  can sort, package or send the pictures.  A cumbersome copy procedure has to  be utilized to get the pictures on the hard drive; from there they need to  be imported to the software. Even with a 450 Pentium II machine, the  transfer was slow (even at the fasted speed setting for the serial port).  The instructions confirmed that photo software does not recognize the  camera as a device to copy from.  It should work just like a scanner (from  a system's perspective).I think the folks at Nikon have a great camera  here but need to work on making it more cost effective and user friendly.  To bring the camera up to speed a minimum of another $200+ would have to be  invested.

The 990  fixes all the complaints people had with the 900 and the 950 (shown here).  It also ups the resolution to 2K x1500 (3.34 Megapixels). It's a fantastic  camera.That much said the 990 is more expensive, and if you don't need  the extra resolution the 950 remains a great choice at a lower price. I  just take exception to Amazon presenting it as \"top of the  line.\"The swiveling body on the 900, 950, and 990 allows you to  hold the camera over your head with the lens looking down, or at your knees  with the lens looking up, and still be able to see your composition on the  LCD display, because the LCD is on the other half of the body from the  lens. You just twist to see the LCD regardless of where the lens is  pointing. Other digital cameras don't do this and it's really useful. It's  made possible by the fact that these cameras (especially the 990) are so  good at autofocus, autoexposure, and autowhite balance that for very many  scenes you can use the LCD to compose and frame the shot, not worry about  anything else, and get a great result.", "Date": "August 21, 2000"}, {"Title": "GOOD: Image quality. BAD: No USB, distortion at wide angle.", "Author": "Spiff", "ReviewID": "R1MMP7CJFGDI78", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own the 950 since the first days when it was launched. Since it is a product with many reviews, I will perhaps focus on a few positive and negative aspects I have found over this time.For positive, well, overall image quality is very good, colors are very balanced and not artificially saturated for that extra good look. I found myself doing some level adjustment sometimes, you will still need your Photoshop, but in any case, even with high-end professional models, you are likely to end up doing some digital darkroom work. The 2.11 CCD is quite good and enough to print excellent photo-quality A4 (I'm in Europe, that's about the area of a 17\" monitor) prints that people will mistake for normal photos (matched with a good printer of course). The firmware is very effective, but a few features have been improved in the 990, which I have used too. The swivel design ends up being VERY useful. Trust me, you will notice the difference sometimes when a normal camera wouldn't work as good. My favorite aspect has to be the absolutely AMAZING macro mode. The 950 can focus sharply at a ridiculously small distance from the subject. This thing is almost a microscope. Yes, it can be tricky to adjust lightning in those cases, but the ability to focus so well at such distances really impressed me when this model came out. So to keep it short, I'm happy when it comes to overall image quality, color accuracy, and features the main problems with this model are:-Considerable barrel distortion at wide angle. If you do a lot of architectural photos or are just unlucky and pick a tricky shot (like a door for instance) at the edges of the screen, at wide angle, well, it is way too obvious sometimes. Few digital cameras offer high-quality lens that are completely (almost) barrel distortion free, but I can't help looking at some cheap digicams using Zeiss lenses and feeling that the Coolpix deserved better. At Tele, the problem is a lot less obvious, but on wide, expect some of your lines to be more like,well...splines. -No USB interface, no Firewire, no nothing besides the plain' old serial interface. Ever tried transferring 48MB at 115k? Well, let's just say that it reminds me the days when I used analog modems. A lot of patience is required. Again, this could and should have been released with USB support (which was widely available at the time).  -Big body. The camera is a big big, not cigarrete-packet size like some Canon's and other models, so, that might end up meaning that you'll take it with you less often. -Some chromatic distortion (purple edges, etc) under certain conditions.  -Forget about using Alkalines they will last 10 minutes. Go for NiMh 1600 rechargeables. The 8MB default card will only hold about 10 photos at maximum resolution, or 1 if you don't want lossy compression. 48 MB or 64 MB cards are essential. -Panel isn't always visible under bright sunlight (newer firmware revisions have addressed this issue, but it's still tricky sometimes) -First versions of NikonView were incredibly , to the point of the user not being able to recover transferred photos after a connection failure (that meant that aborted transfers at 90% of the card when you're using a slow serial protocol meant starting all over, quite fun). Don't worry, NikonView is now a lot more solid and, but I did suffer with the first versions. Overall, a very good camera that can give you very good photos (and that means printed photos). Also, keep in mind that the final price ends up rising, since you're likely to need at least the following accessories: A Bigger CompactFlash card (48 MB or 64 MB), At least 4 NiMh 1600 batteries + a charger, and a decent caseWith Zeiss lens instead of the Nikkor 7-21mm used and USB interface, this could still be the best 2.11 on the market.

My first venture into  digital at 640 X 480 gave me a wish list of what it would take to satisfy  the quality requirements for serious photography.  A new, Hi resolution  printer paved the way for the arrival of the Coolpix 950 into my evolving  'desktop darkroom'. The quality / format range of basic 640 X 480 to XGA  Fine, to Uncompressed TIFF is magnificently supported by Nikon's superb  optics, accurate exposure options, adequate zoom range and very usable  macro.  From my Siamese Cat's eyes, to a handmade silver Hopi ring, to  mountain landscapes, all can be reproduced in astoundingly fine detail,  given a good quality printer.

The Pros:1. Oustanding image quality, great colours, etc. Typically Nikon does err a little on the side of preserving detail, so you might find a little contrast/brightness adjustment in Photoshop to your taste. 2. Enough manual control if you want. Enough point and shoot in the Auto mode if you don't. 3. That swivel head gives great flexibility. 4. Best shot selection gives some really interesting flexibility with regard to avail. light photography (OK, so I know I really should use a tripod). The Not-so-good:1. The flash is disappointing. Terribly easy to red-eye anything biological :) Get the bracket and an add-on flash if you have to shoot flash. To be fair, tough for _any_ camera with the flash/lens this close together to not have the same problem (red eye reduc. or not).2. The pre-exposure focus lock does not 'feel' as definite (when you partially depress the exposure button) as on Nikon's 35mm SLRs. The nice, nice thing about the 990 is that the area of focus is artificially sharpened in the LCD viewfinder. _Very_ tough to check focus in 950 LCD viewfinder until _after_ you take the pic and magnify in the LCD. 3. Definitely less than great for fast moving action. Digitals in general are not the greatest for moving action. For long-time 35mm users, this is probably the hardest thing to get used to. By the time, you add in the focusing time, save to CF card, etc., there is a definite delay between pulling the trigger & getting the shot, as well as a significant delay between shots (flash use makes it worse). Some of this can be negated by swithing to Manual and presetting a focus distance, and so on, but it's an adjustment. Recommendations:1. Get three sets of NiMH rechargeable AA batteries--this thing eats batteries for breakfast.  2. Get a bigger CF memory card, at least 48MB.  3. Get a USB/PC card reader for the CF card--the serial connection is _painfully_ slow.  4. Download the .PDF file from Nikon's site which goes into a little more detail what the controls do.  5. Get this book! :)...  Would I get this again? YES, but I would probably spring the extra bucks for a Coolpix 990 for:1. Focus area sharpening 2. Selectable autofocus area 3. USB 4.

The image quality is stunning and I didn't find it all that hard to figure out how to use it. The controls are generally well thought out and positioned  ergonomically. The camera is also slow (I think this is true with most  digital cameras.) You click the shutter and about 1 or 2 secs later it  takes the picture. This may not sound like a big deal, but last night I was  trying to take pictures of my infant son, and in that amount of time he  often moved his face away from the camera.A significant short coming is  the built in flash. Its nowhere near powerful enough, even for a simple  head and shoulders shot when the subject is 4 feet away. Images often come  out too dark. This wouldn't be so bad if there were accomodations for an  external flash, but there doesn't seem to be one. Also, the camera tends to  create \"red eye\" a lot, which you can correct if you have  PhotoShop, but that's more work than I want to do.The camera does eat up  a lot of power, I agree with the others who suggest getting rechargeable  batteries. You can get a set of NiMH batteries and a charger for about $20  bucks (it takes 4 AA batteries.)

The 8 MB card that it comes with is too small if you plan to shoot in 1600x1200 resolutions. 3.

Eventually, even if you're careful, the chintzy little lightweight plastic slots on the camera body that the battery door tabs lock into, will break, and your otherwise finely made and great performing camera will need a generous strip of ducttape to hold the door closed - this makes the necessity of using the highest capacity NiMH battery you can find all that more important.

The camera pivots in half (which is quite disconcerting and a bit confusing) so you can change the angle of the viewing screen to the lens. The whole thing rotates freely 360 degrees, with snap-lock settings at each 180, so you can watch yourself \"taking a picture of you\" or use the viewing screen versus the manual viewfinder. The flash is a bit annoying, as it automatically fires in even remotely low-light circumstances. A simple press of a button disables the flash, but then you have a longer exposure time (about one full second) which means that you have to keep your hands really, really still. Just for fun, try taking a picture of the full moon and see how much you hand shakes.This camera is really at its best during the day. It should win an award for being the official picnic (or even beach) camera. It really is point and shoot, but it has an easy to learn and use zoom, auto/manual flash, and you can turn off the viewfinder with the push of a button if you are running low on battery.

My guesstimate is something like 3-5 frames-per-second of video capture on the view screen while you are searching for that perfect moment to snap the picture.The short version: It is self-contained, easy to load and swap the memory card. It takes high resolution photos, and is so easy to use (and durable) that a 5 year-old could handle it (carefully). Stock up on extra AA batteries though. It eats through 4 of them in a few days of use.Hope this helps", "Date": "September 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Still Woks in 2007!", "Author": "Chuck \"Arthy77\"", "ReviewID": "R28O4NGMT3FO8S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is dated, but still works.

I currently sell items on eBay, and I've been using a HP C200 Digital Camera for the past year to take pictures of items that I was selling.  It got the job done, but when it came to detailed shots and close ups, it just didn't cut it.  I just received my Nikon Coolpix 950 and it's amazing.  Excellent detail at 1600x1200 resolution.  The close up shots (Macro Shots) are amazing.  I'm extremely satisfied with this camera.  If your a near power seller eBayer like myself, and you have the money, invest it into this camera.  It's really worth it.  I did my homework, and this camera gets you the best bang for your buck.  The CP800 and CP880 are good, but they are slightly worse than this model, and they require non-AA batteries, which are very expensive (so are the rechargeable ones and the charger).  The Coolpix 990 is slightly better than this model (it takes slightly better pictures and it boasts a higher resolution), but if you don't have the money, this model is worth it.  The Coolpix 950 and the Coolpix 990 are the best two digital camera's that you can buy for under $1000.00.  If you want to go up another level, you need to be ready to shovel out over $3000.00 for camera's like the Nikon D1.  For accessories, get a USB CompactFlash Card reader, an A/C Adaptor, and two sets of rechargeable batteries.  I recommend a tripod as well, a small one especially for Macro shots.  Overall, this is a very good camera.  The Coolpix 990 has better resolution, better picture quality, and its design is better, but if you don't have the extra money, the Coolpix 950 is simply the best you can get.", "Date": "January 12, 2001"}, {"Title": "Quick Digital", "Author": "\"bmpu90\"", "ReviewID": "R15GB0DNHMRX6B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned a Ricoh & a Nikon Digital.

The optical 3x zoom is nothing special, the standard lens is not wide-angle enough and the resulting photos are no better than some of its cheaper rivals. My suggestion? Purchase the CP800 if you can, its not jammed with as many high-megapixels, but its convenience, fast operability and consistent results play a huge role!
