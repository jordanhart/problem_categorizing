The purchase was made because my wife and I were going on a vacation, and our older Canon is no longer working.  Overall, we are very pleased with the features and picture quality of this camera.  Our trip was to Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, and Zion National Park.  We took several hundred pictures and found the pictures had wonderful color and clarity whether shooting the red and white \"hoodoos\" and cliffs of Bryce Canyon or a closeup of cactus in bloom.  A few pictures had less than perfect focus, but at least in some cases, that probably had more to do with the photographer than the camera.  We have also used it with good results at an indoor family event, where we got some nice pictures with or without flash.The only negatives I experienced are relatively minor.  At the longest zoom length the camera will struggle to focus on a moving object.  No surprise there, I think that's probably one of the toughest things to ask a camera to do.  I was also a little disappointed at the shutter lag considering it has a CMOS image sensor which is supposedly quicker than a CCD sensor.

That's exactly why this item was purchased. Great response in delivery as well! Nice packaging. Would like to know what camera case would be good for this. Would like to have an option to include additional memory as well.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "What a dissapointment!", "Author": "V. Davis", "ReviewID": "R182YZ7RW0CI4P", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for $179 from QVC, wanting a little more zoom than a standard point and shoot.  Took camera to Mexico on vacation and used for Xmas also.  Any photo taken with the flash appears washed and has white spots that look like overexposure no matter how far or close I stood from the subject.  Also flash would not fire in Auto mode ???  Had to set it to other modes to get it to work.I contacted Olympus since the manual was no help.  I sent over 20 emails back and forth to Olympus trying to attach sample photos to show them.  Their email server continually rejected all the emails with photos attached even within the file size range they suggested.  I finally gave up.  I spent $40 at Best Buy for an extra battery also.I had to send the camera back after making every effort on my end to correct issues.  What a disappointment!", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "5+ stars", "Author": "Seth Pecore", "ReviewID": "R33ZYAH2508PQV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very nice!
