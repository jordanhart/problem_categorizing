Those with larger zoom are quite bulky, you can't carry around all the time. I think a slim camera is a better choice. I slip into my pocket while wondering around and come across something nice and take a picture of it. You can't do it with a huge camera.After I made up mind about a slim camera, my choices were either Casio Exilim or Sony DSCW series. Casio Exilims are very sexy. They have a lot of mode scenes. They also function as voice recorder. You can take pictures of book pages etc. They have anti-shake capability which is said to reduce blurred images. I was almost buying a Casio Exilim. Being a diligent person I wanted to search more and more.I found out that the so-called anti-shake feature is a bogus. Many people found it useless. That was a good reason to choose Casio. Then I found the picture quality of Exilim is not really good.I found some pictures taken with Exilim. They were soft, not crisp colors. Search the web reviews made by photo professionals. Casio Exilim is rated significantly less than Sony in picture quality. With ISO 200 noise was still detectable in most reviews . Those same reviewers however found Sony DSCW doing a better job . There was no noise with ISO 400 which means even in lower light condition Sony did a better job (less granularity in pictures with low light). Big difference!.One feature of Sony that made it very attractive was its strong macro. It is 0.74 inch which means you can bring your camera 0.74 inch (2 mm) close to an object (say a bug) and still take a brilliant picture of it.Now comparison of Exilim and Sony to summarize:Casio ExilimAnti-shake (it's a bogus)SlimLower macro (2.5 inches)Lower picture quality (detectable noise at ISO 200)A lot of scene modesQuick shutterSony DSCW SeriesSlim (in fact it is slimmer)Higher macro (0.74 inches)Higher picture quality (No noise in ISO 400)Not a lot of scene modesQuick shutterSo.....I purchased a Sony DSCW 7 Mp. I took lots of pictures.They are all brilliant, detailed and crisp, true colors.I tried macro and took pictures of bugs. You can see the hairs on the legs of bugs. Absolutely no noise whatsoever, no blurry.It's a marvel of technology. I took pictures of fireworks in July 4th using high ISO setting. They came out brialliantly like professional pictures.It also uses a different kind of battery that you can't buy at your grocery which can leave you vulnerable. So you may wanna buy a spare one (about 40 bucks). But you can always recharge it. And it lasts much much longer than AAA or Nimh batteries.It was a perfect choice.

I needed something small to fit in my purse.  I chose Sony because I'm a proud owner of a Sony Mavica MVC-FD95.  I've been using it for about 8 years, and I think it takes the best digital photos indoors and out. It's only cons for me is the long processing time between photos, and it's just too large to bring on vacation.  Anyway, I found this Sony Cybershot DSC-W70 to take very nice pictures during the day in natural sunlight.  But was disappointed with the overall brightness of the shots when used indoors in a low-light setting -- specifically indoors with no natural sunlight. Every picture just seemed too dark.  I tried every reasonable setting on the camera to try and force the flash when I wanted a well exposed photo, but I never did figure it out. With my trusty old Mavica, just pop open the flash and it will go off. My old camera also has a great zoom lens.  I didn't think I'd miss it so much, but I did. I decided to return the Cybershot DSC-W70 to Amazon after taking a whole bunch of indoor photos (taken in the evening) at Christmas time. Again, I tried several different settings, attempting to get the brighter exposure I wanted, but every picture wasn't worth developing.  That was such a huge disappointment for me.  I took the time to take so many photos of my extended family and not one was decent. For now, I will continue on with my trusty old Mavica.  Maybe my next camera will be the Sony Cybershot DSC-H5.  It's not tiny, but I think it's the next best thing to my Mavica.  My opinion of the DSC-W70 camera is it is a nice slim camera for natural sunlight photographs.  It served my needs for my vacation, but was not serving my needs in my every day life.  My main use for the camera was not to take pictures of landscapes, etc, but to take photos of my young children and family.", "Date": "February 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Simple, Great!", "Author": "Camas Mom", "ReviewID": "R1GRJE4PIUMB9O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My beloved Cybershot 4.0, purchased in 2000, was on its last leg, so I purchased the Cybershot DSCW70 7.2MP yesterday (with a 1 gig Memory Card).

I bought this camera, but returned it for the lower resolution DSC 50 6MP, which I am fairly happy with. My two primary criteria in choosing a camera were intuitively obvious ergonomics (my wife tends not read the manual, and not to remember the instructions if she does read them), and a very short lag before capturing the image.  When shopping stores, salespeople steered me towards the newer Sony DSC series or Canon Powershots for speed.  I chose the Sony because I found their operation to be much, much more intuitive.  I particularly like the feature that, as you change the shooting mode, the name and description of the mode come up on the screen.  This allows basic features to be used without any reference to instructions.  Since buying my camera, I have found that the menu system is difficult to negotiate even with the instructions.  Most of the time, though, we just point and shoot at rapidly moving children.  When the DSC W70 arrived I was disappointed to find that it's response time was noticably slower than the DSC W50 that I had looked at in stores.  I took my new camera to a store and tried it head to head against the W50 to make sure I wasn't imagining things.  In fact the, 6MP DSC W50 is consistently, noticably faster to capture an image than the 7.2MP DSCW70 despite their otherwise identical design.  Setting the resolution of the W70 to 5MP did NOT resolve the problem.  Since a high resolution picture of the space where my son was doing something cute a few seconds ago is not much use to me, I returned this camera.  Both the W70 and W50 are faster in strong light and with distant subjects, so if you mostly shoot outside you may not have the same problem I did.  For me, it was an important enough issue to pay return shipping, which more than wiped out any savings from buying the lower res camera.  And did you know that if you return an item bought with Super Saver shipping, Amazon charges retroactively for the original shipping?

Well, first off if I had looked at these reviews before this purchase (my husband surprised me with this camera) I might not have bought this one.  So here goes:  My first sony cypershot was a dsc-p92  5 mega pixels and in all fairness I guess it was a \"good\" camera at the time.. I've had that one for a very long time, problems arose so much with that camera, such as dead batteries (used AA's) within an 1/2 hour of placing new ones,, but I am getting off subject.  The sony cypershot dsc-w70 camera is GREAT.  well mostly anyway..  I have had this camera for about a year, so I have had lots of uses for it.  PROS:---LCD screen is a good 2 inches.  great size!---small enough to fit in a pocket.---lithium battery is way better than those AA's---quick to turn on---quick time between first picture taken and next---great pictures in any light.  I have taken pictures in a very dim lit room late at nite and pictues came out great. Don't understand how others are having such a big difference in their pictures.---does take great action pictures.. My daughter and her friends, do a jump and flip with their skateboards mid-air and this camera has stopped the action in its tracks without it being the least bit blurry, and that's with a bunch of 13 yr olds taken them-----I have taken many pictures while driving and they too come out without a problem.  What I have found that works great is to push the shutter button halfway down then take the picture.  Not one bad picture while in a moving car since then.----video playback works very well, microphone works decent enough that you don't have to be right on top of who you are recording.  Though if you talk it will pick that up.  Records concerts, plays, anything your kids or whoever  might be performing.----Battery lasts a long time before a charge, videotaped approx 1 1/2 hrs of a concert(non-stop) and didnt even go to a half charge (while using the lcd)---Has been dropped by my daughter and has not been damaged or scratched at all.---Easy to set up to download pictures and such into your computer, but with just one cord hooks up to your tv to view pictures there..(my other sony this was not an option just the computer you could view)---Has a viewfinder!  So many digital cameras out there now no longer offer a viewfinder, which most of us probally don't use, but if your batteries are getting low turn off the lcd and that battery will last longer  CONS:---If you want to videotape, you must remember to zoom if you choose BEFORE you start to record, because you cannot do it once you start.---The spot where they put the dial for the different types of settings tends to get moved around when you remove camera from either your purse, camera bag or pocket, so be sure to check setting before taking that picture.---Twilight setting is not good at all unless you have a tripod.  camera takes way to long to take picture and if you move even the slightest the picture will be very very blurry. you would be better off using the auto setting and hoping for the best.  which pictures do come out just fine IF subject is close to you, far away it would be black, though it only has a small flash built in and is not a 1,000 dollar camera.All in all, I am very glad my husband just happened to pick out this camera.  Extremly happy with the camera and am not even thinking about getting a new one yet. (Knock wood) LOL  Are there better cameras out there??  Most likely, but there are worse ones also.

Since then, I have shot over 7,000 fotos with it, in all kinds of conditions, all kinds of subjects. I have rarely been disappointed with its performance. In a bright outdoors, it sometimes is a bit difficult to see the screen. But I do know its limitations. The macro is wonderful..my Flickr stream ( I am sagehopper, if you want to see what it does )  is full of macro shots. It is a marvelous little camera, and just slips into a pocket, smaller than a pack of cigarettes. The battery life is good, if I do not use the flash heavily. I have taken 30, 40 shots with flash on the same setting..But if no flash, I have shot as many as 200 shots before needing to recharge..I have a big Canon DSLR that can do little more than the little Cybershot can do, with more complex handling. The digital zoom does very well, but in the extreme end, the resolution suffers. However, I rarely shoot over 2 or 3 megs. I have had perhaps 30 of my fotos taken with this camera published in newspapers, and travel brochures. I heartily recommend this little (but mighty) camera to a digital beginner, as I was when I bought it. The manual that came with the camera was very well written and easy to understand,,even for a rank beginner as I was. The online problem solving is very helpful..I asked them a couple technical questions (not a problem or troubleshooting deal) and was satisfied. Get one of these little guys, if you want troublefree, easy and very reliable use. I have 7.2 megs on it, but have never used it to its capability And the Memory Stick Pro Duo memory card holds a lot more fotos than i would shoot in a year..thousands. Mine is 4gigs.

I think another reviewer mentioned the same thing.Then, about 5 month months ago the settings dial became really fidgety. When rotated to the 'movie' setting, it would act like it was stuck b/w the 'movie' and 'auto adjustment' setting. I would have to tap the setting dial and sometimes it would 'stick' to the correct setting I selected. Also the preview screen would be 'booted off' and back to camera mode.

It was a great camera when I first bought it but after about 4 months of having it every picture no matter what setting the camera was on or what environment the photo was being taken came out really dark and extremely blurry. The camera has never been dropped nor has it had any damage done to it but it still refuses to take any decent or useable pictures. The other problem I have with this camera is the battery. The battery is not one that can just be replaced when it dies it is a rechargable. The first battery I had only lasted a good 6 months and then finally wouldn't hold a charge no matter how long I left it plugged in for so I resorted to buying another one which cost $53.00 at the local battery store (the only place in town that carried this spec. battery) and that battery only worked for less than a month. Now the camera is not useable because I refuse to spend another $53 on a battery that will probably die after a few months and for a camera that won't take worthy pictures in the first place.

Of course, Sony said it was my fault and that I must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that PDA - after 1 month? Since the camera was out of warranty, I knew there was nothing they were going to do. So if you want a DECENT camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it!
