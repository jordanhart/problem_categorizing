Only issues (also not any surprise) are the poor build and loud noise the lens make when auto focusing. All in all it is a cheap alternate for a 50mm lens. I still don't understand why Canon would make it this way. Perhaps, they are trying to keep the cost down as well.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0031OCE4C"}}
