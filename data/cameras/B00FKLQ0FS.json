For the cost of explaining to you friends that Pentax does still make very good cameras, you get a feature set that above and beyond what the \"Big Two\" offer at this price.  Along that line, this is Pentax's current flagship camera.  That means they held nothing back.  There are no capabilities reserved for more expensive cameras in the line, and that should eliminate any buyers remorse.If you enjoy using manual focus, a Pentax Camera is a no brainer.  Their DSLRs use the classic Pentax K mount.  This allows you to mount (without an adapter) an arsenal of great old lenses.  Did I mention in-body image stabilization?  Not only can you build a small library of lenses, but utilize modern (and very effective) image stabilization on every one.  In the K-3 Pentax dedicated a servo to its image stabilization.As for the K-3...  I also own a K-30 and purchased the K-3 to be a primary body, with the K-30 serving backup, in order to start taking on portrait contracts.  Do not let the APS-C sensor size steer you away.  Many pros are now shooting Fujifilm (APS-C) and Olympus (m4/3).  The focus peaking is very accurate and easy to use.  The dual SD card slots is a nice pro feature.  However, if you were hoping for WiFi, this is only achieved via SD card.  Considering the trend towards connected cameras, this is unfortunate.  But if you shoot RAW and dedicate your time to a post-processing workflow, than WiFi may be unnecessary.  The IQ is brilliant and the colors and WB are the best I have seen from Pentax.  The shutter/mirror sound is very quiet and precise sounding.  And if you are interested in video capabilities, Pentax has finally taken you into consideration with the K-3.  The camera is very customizable if you take the time to explore the labyrinth of menu screens.  Overall, this camera is a leap forward for the company.PS. A firmware update was just released so any issues you may read about prior to Dec. 19th may have been addressed in the new firmware.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Another great camera by Pentax", "Author": "Matt Hollingsworth", "ReviewID": "R2A85S9YVZRKE3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Photography is my favorite hobby. I bought my first Pentax (ME  Super) after saving for two years on my paper route in middle school. After a twenty year hiatus, I started shooting using the new digital Pentax cameras a few years ago. I loved the K5. Things I like about Pentax: they focus on what advanced amateur's like instead of flashy features. The cameras are more compact, very durable (you can drop them from hand height without damage!). They can use virtually any lens with an adapter (Canons have trouble with some older lenses even with an adapter). They integrate the shake reduction into the camera so that it works with all lenses and you don't need to re-buy the anti-shake with every new lens. They don't add features on a whim - and instead evolve the product in a backwards compatible and practical way. The K3 exemplifies this design methodology. It sticks with APS-C instead of jumping on the old full frame band wagon. That's great because the quality is similar to full frame, but the camera is smaller and all the lenses are smaller. They improved the sharpness, the dynamic range and shake reduction. The sharpness improvement without the AA filter is amazing. The batteries and battery charger are identical with the k5. Another example of the backwards compat. They improved the lens release button which was flawed on the k5. And the sensors on both the K3 and K5 vie for the highest dynamic range in the industry. Too bad there is no six star rating. This is my favorite possession.

I am interested in taking pictures of birds and wanted a camera that is rugged and weather sealed but that also has high image quality.  I also prefer an APS-C camera sensor which is an advantage for birding due to its increased effective focal length which allows one to put \"more pixels on the bird\" for better detail of feathers and such. The Pentax K-3 fits the bill perfectly.  I paired it with the terrific Pentax DA*300 mm lens, which is also weather sealed and super sharp, and couldn't be more pleased!  Now I have a terrific birding setup that takes amazing images but is still light enough to carry around in the field without having to use a tripod.DPreview has an end of the year poll on their website for The Best DSLR of 2013.

The clarity and crispness is amazing! The RAW images the K3 spits out contain data from the darkest blacks to the brightest whites, giving enormous room for developing the RAW photos to JPEG.Comparable cameras like the Canon 70D have all the bells and whistles, like built in wireless, touch screen, video autofocus etc. That is nice to have if you like gadgets, if you like cameras, get the K3. It'll wipe the floor with the 70D in photographic output. The only feature I envy the 70D for is the swivel screen, which would be a great photographic tool to have. Maybe it'll be implemented in the next model. The dual cards are great for shooting RAW+JPEG for example, or just using the convenience it provides to have massive amounts of storage available if needed.The live view function has been massively improved over the K5, the focus being several times snappier and accurate.I took over 600 shots last weekend alone in combination with the mind-blowing Pentax 35mm 2.8 Limited Macro and the Sigma 70mm 2.8 Macro. The bokeh, colors and contrast these lenses paint onto the K3's sensor are pure art! Can't say it any differently.If you are starting out and aren't yet locked into any camera brand, give the K3 a go.

I went thru Canon 60D, Nikon D7000, and D7100.  All are great cameras but somehow they never fit my hands and I had a hardtime getting good skin colors out of them.  Yes, I know I can adjust the picture setting and I did, however, either skins came up too red or too orange, and if I got the skin right the other colors were not right.  Too much fiddling.  My goal is to capture memories, not operate a machine.Then I read about K3 + 18-135mm and decided to give it a try.  First of all, the pictures out of the camera is great.  The shake-reduction works great, I had more 24megapixel sharp pictures then D7100.  Second, the button placement and the functions assigned dont need any changing; I can do what I think without any effort.  There is attention to detail (ie. there is an opening on the bottom of the lens hood to rotate the polarized lenses.).the AF takes time to focus initially than what I remember w/ 60D+18-55SDM but not too much.  I am totally ok with that because pictures come out sharper.  I'm happy with AF tracking my kids once it locks.  I wanted to mention this in case you happened to use a Canon+SDM lense combo (which was instantaneous AF).My goal is to capture memories and Pentax K3 gets out of the way to make that happen.  I'm very happy with it and will not look for another DSLR until it dies.It's a lot of bang for the buck.

My previous cameras were the K-7 and K-01. The K-3 is leaps and bounds ahead of both.The autofocus is always spot-on. I've taken about 200 shots so far; the AF hasn't missed one. Many of these were in low-light. I haven't tried the continuous AF on moving subjects, yet.The detail capture is stellar. Kudos to Pentax/Ricoh for removing the AA filter.High ISO and noise: I was impressed. The amount of noise with extreme ISO levels (12,800 - 25,600) at 100% is about the same as the last generation of APS-C cameras. But here's the catch: you have way more pixels to work with, so the noise performance is actually great. If you were to downsize a high-ISO image from the K-3 and compare it to a high-ISO image from last generation, the K-3 would look significantly better. (Though it already looks really good before you even clean it up.)Body: I haven't really tested this camera yet, but it seems to be built as tough as the previous top-end Pentax DSLRs. I put my K-7 through all kinds of abuse: rain, snow, the tropics, and a minor chemical accident. 20,000 shots and a few years later - still works like the day I got it (the 18-55 WR kit lens, too).The ergonomics have not changed a lot, but the K-3 seems slightly more comfortable to hold and easy to operate (thanks to a couple of button layout changes) than the K-7. YMMV.-----The 18-135 lens----The bundled lens is a mixed bag.The build quality and autofocus are excellent. The zoom range is very useful. The sharpness in the center of the image is good. But the border sharpness is a huge letdown. I believe the trusty (and cheaper) old 18-55 WR has better border sharpness, which makes a difference in landscape photography (at least if you are pixel-peeper or plan on printing big poster-size prints).If you're after excellent image quality with weather-sealing, better look to the DA* 16-50. Or save yourself some money and buy the DA 18-55 WR if you only need good image quality. I would only recommend the 18-135 bundle if you want the versatility of a wide-to-telephoto zoom and you're willing to give up image quality around the edges of the frame.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "loving it", "Author": "Joey Cook", "ReviewID": "R10VC26UKL9MZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this model for about a week now I have used it in several situations where I would use my older canons and it has performed superior to them.

This is an amazing camera!!! I was shooting a K-5 for the past few years that I really liked but felt the auto focus left a lot to be desired. I thought about upgrading to the K-5 IIs when it was first introduced, but the fact that the sensor was exactly the same made me decide to wait on something better. I was really trying to hold out until they produced a full frame which I was praying would be soon, or I was even thinking about switching to Nikon, Canon or Sony in order to get a full frame. I have such a wonderful lot of lenses that I have been slowly growing the past 6 years that I didn't want to part with and have to start over from scratch. Plus after originally shooting Canon with my very first DSLR back in the day of 3.3 megapixels that I hated I just couldn't get myself to make the switch to Canon. I even bought a Nikon D3200 for my son to learn on, but truthfully it was to see if I could ever switch over to Nikon. Well the answer is a definite 'NO'!! It just appears backwards to me from the way you put the lens on by twisting counter clockwise to the meter being + on the left and - on the right. It is totally opposite on Pentax, and it is totally incorrect!!! Pentax just makes sense!!! The button layout, menus, and ergonomics are just infinitely better. Now with the new focus system in the K-3 and greater lower light shots, I couldn't ask for anything better. Sure a full frame will give me that extra depth of field and shoot better in low light, but after looking at the comparison pictures of the K-3 and the Nikon d600 with similar settings and lenses, I have no doubt that staying with this crop sensor was the way to go!! The K-3 images were actually better except at ISO of 6400 which let's face it....who cares? I don't even shoot at 1600 much less 6400. I rarely even go over 400 if I can help it. Now I can patiently wait for Pentax to come out with their full frame, and I will enjoy this awesome crop sensor while I am waiting. In fact, they don't even have to rush.

I'm comparing this to my Pentax K20D (top of the line camera 5 years ago).  If your situation is much different, don't bother reading this review, other reviews will be more helpful to you.Improvements made in the K-3 vs K20:+Screen is much appreciably larger (better preview, displays more info), brighter, sharper, less glare.  The size impressed me more than I expected.+Frames per second increased from 3 to 8.  This is amazing when you actually use it,  so fast, and the shutter is quieter.  I used to miss the action when taking sports pictures (my kid's soccer game).+Movie Mode! with built in microphone and speaker, and jacks for good external microphone and earphone. Can use Auto focus with buttons before shooting, then manual focus on lens during shooting, full BluRay quality, 1080/30p.+HDMI output, allows you to see everything that would have been on the rear display panel (liveview, playback, info), great for studio shooting so a large group can see the pictures during the session.+More dials and buttons, more customization, more ergonomic setup (surprising they could make so many improvements each year, but they do).+easier to control and navigate selections (don't need to go into menus as often, many options are displayed on back display in control panel mode, for quick selection/change of options and focus points with 8 way joystick style control buttons).+Deeper grip is easier and more comfortable to hold.+Focus peaking!  If you don't know what this is, check out videos on youtube and be amazed, makes focusing easier.+Dual card slots, (I'm using a very fast SD card for bursts of pictures, and a large slower card for Video; I'll also use the 2nd slot at times for wireless card).+Flucard, (horrible name, good features), allows wireless camera control/tethering, from a smartphone/tablet/PC, with previews and file transfers.+Light on front for Auto focus (can focus in dark room).+Much better ISO (less grainy in low-light)+performance improved all around (better shake reduction, sensor dust removal, more pixels, much faster operation with less delays, faster and more accurate auto focus....)+HDR in camera, so you can capture deep shadows and bright highlights, processed faster in camera than my fast PC can do. The fast 8fps shutter speed helps here, since people and branches in the breeze move less between each exposure).+New features for of built in sensor image stabilizer, 1) when on a tripod, you can adjust the sensor tilt angle, and move up/down or sidways, rather than moving the camera on the tripod.  2)Adjustable Anti Alias Filter gives choise to get rid of Moire patterns, or have better detail. 3) Track stars (without trails) for up to a few minutes (time depends if lens is telephoto or wide angle)with optional GPS.+Raw image can be saved, After you have already taken the picture as a JPEG. (the last picture taken can be converted to RAW format, since most recent picture is saved in the camera buffer).  Useful for those rare occasions where I don't have an opportunity to retake a picture that was poorly exposed, and want to get more shadow detail out the the larger RAW file.+Electronic Level, so your picture aren't crooked as often.+Extra 2 year USA warranty (3 yr total) for $19, (you can buy official Pentax warranty from B&H; or Adorama within 30 days of getting camera from Amazon). Usually I consider extended warranties a ripoff, but this one is at an attractive price, and includes one free checkup in addition to any needed repairs.+Automatic correction for lens distortions, Chromatic Aberrations, and vignetting (dark edges), for Pentax lenses, when saving as JPEG.  (Does take a little longer to store the picture if all corrections are turned on).On the complaint side:-I wish they wouldn't keep changing the AC power supply and Grip.  I keep having to spend an extra ~$300 each time I upgrade for these accessories.-Doesn't come with USB3 cable, nor HDMI cables, which older versions shipped with (you need the \"type-D\" HDMI connector, which looks like the USB connector on some smartphones, but a bit smaller with more wires).-Still no internal GPS (which Pentax offered for some years now in compact cameras), requires external GPS unit on hot shoe (so can't use flash in hotshoe), at extra cost.The advances made in DSLR Camera bodies are similar to the changes in smartphones.

It is a top-to-bottom redesign, replacing the already good K-5ii and K-5iis.Feature-wise, spec-wise and performance-wise, the K-3 easily competes with the Nikon D7100 and Canon 70d.  But in some ways it has even a little more to offer.  Notably, this is the only camera on earth that can emulate having an AA filter, (to use when moire might be a risk), but without the full-time sacrifice of detail imposed by installing a true low pass filter. In addition, I'm not sure anyone else offers a star-tracking feature that uses GPS (optional) and the mirror to follow the earth's rotation.  Very cool.  But most importantly, this camera's anti-shake is built into the body, not the lenses - meaning it works even with any old K-mount lens you find at a garage sale.  And the system works quite well, buying you 3ev or so.Pros will enjoy having two SD slots, very fast continuous shooting and a slick new auto-focus system that is (finally!) first rate - as good as anyone's.  The K-3 is pretty forgiving about low light / high ISO shooting. You'll see some noise at 3200 but it cleans up pretty easily.While the video has greatly improved over prior models, there is still no continuous AF, making other choices more attractive for those planning to record their little girl's first ballet.  (Think Canon.)  This camera is for still-shooters, who will fall in love with it.For existing Pentax owners, the upgrade is largely familiar in terms of control placement.  What moved, mostly, needed to. Using the camera is a breeze once you learn the controls, and there are many.  Within a week, though, I found I could control the camera even in the dark, so the layout must be fairly intuitive.  Better, so much can be controlled from buttons and switches that I almost never need to navigate the menu.Image quality is superb, and with 24mp one can crop deeply and retain surprisingly sharp detail.  Colors are rich but authentic and white balance, so far, has been spot-on using the auto setting.Ricoh has placed their badge on the camera's back - I guess that's OK, as long as the Pentax name stays on the front.  While nobody else is close to the Big Two in this market, I'd hate to see the Pentax brand weakened or supplanted.

However, now that this has dragged on for months, I feel it's worth leaving my thoughts on the subject.Long-story short, the issue I had is called \"Crazy Mirror Flapping\" or \"Runaway Mirror\" in the Pentax world. The camera locks up, becomes otherwise unresponsive, and the mirror starts flapping at a machine-gun pace until you pull out the battery. I exchanged my first K3 for a new one, only to have the same issue. It's unpredictable when it happens, and seems to occurs in all types of conditions with a variety of settings, so I had no choice but to \"downgrade\" to the K5-IIs.I also had a series of silent lockups (no mirror-flapping), where the camera would just become completely unresponsive and I'd have to pop out the battery to get it to function again.And I had one incident where after a full day of professional shooting, the SD card became corrupted (after a lockup), and I spent many hours over a weekend trying to recover all the photos.Both lockup issues happened through all firmware versions up to the latest, version 1.03.The K3 just proved too unreliable for professional shooting. It is incredibly disappointing because the camera is brilliant in so many other ways. The image quality is outstanding and feature-set is impressive. For this level DSLR it is small and light, yet still incredibly durable.If not for the severe reliability issues, I'd have nothing but good things to say about it.For more information on the crazy mirror issue - visit the PentaxForums.com, K3 ForumsFor a video showing silent lockup and crazy mirror flapping lockup - see YouTube watch?v=CS_kYy3SVww", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Astounded", "Author": "K.

The way the camera sits in my hand, the reliability and the fact that I can still use my oldest Pentax lens which is now some 35 years old with image stabilization (admittedly without auto focus) means that investment in the line is seldom wasted. This latest model has slots for 2 memory cards, the new sensor is APS C sized and tops out at 24 megapixels.I haven't used it for video recording, and probably will not, and I am not lab equipped to compare performance with other makes, but my initial impressions are that it lives up to its claims.

I can shoot IR with my Nikons or my Canon, none of which are weather resistant, which is why I bought this camera.)2.  Like Canon, too cheap to include a USB cable.  (It uses the same cable as my Nikon D-800 and D-800E)3.  No Pentax proprietary software to load on your computer for uploading pictures.  They do include a pretty nice basic editing software, but as opposed to Nikon and Canon, there is no uploading software.  Once again, a minor issue.  You have a gazillion uploading options.

Simply do a web search for K3 reviews and you'll have hours of reading material and virtually all positive. Since Ricoh purchased Pentax and got them out of the awful Hoya ownership, the brand has come alive again.Best of all the camera is designed for serious photographers with unique features that still are lacking in other DSLRs and mirror less designs from SONY, Nikon, Canon and all the others. Examples include a programmable anti-aliasing filter ranging in three steps from off to full on, optional GPS hot shoe gadget that controls the movement of the sensor to track the night sky for night photography, 7fps, extremely quiet shutter, weather sealed, allow body, and arguably the smallest size and weight of any professional grade APS body.Both Nikon and Pentax use SONY sensors and the 24 meg sensor in the K3 is exceptionally well implemented by Pentax.  If you shoot RAW format instead of JPG, you can use software such as Adobe Light Room to process the files and achieve incredibly good dynamic range and recovery of shadow detail under low light conditions.The K3 is an exceptional camera for still photography. It's weakness is it's video capability which is just OK, at best. But Pentax isn't alone in this area.  Pentax, Canon, Nikon, all trail Panasonic  and to a lesser degree SONY at this point in terms of video implementation. If you have a need for extremely high performance video in a still camera, the Panasonic GH4 trumps anything presently available from Pentax, SONY, Nikon or Canon, enabling everything from Ultra HD/Cine 4K to 720P.

All of these are quite good for a variety of reasons but for overall 'camera' the K-3 is the best.  HOWEVER, here is an issue for which the camera gets two stars: the camera has frozen on me a couple of times and the only way to fix this is by turning it off and then back on!  Once you turn it on, all the custom setting you have applied are gone and the camera is set to default.

According to others, this issue (freezing) apparently appears to be there even with the latest 1.03 firmware version]REVIEW UPDATE: I have not been able to duplicate the freezing problem having taken thousands of pix since the episode.  I am, therefore, upgrading my rating to a five based on the camera's performance.  If this freeze issue comes up again I will change my rating.  I can't say enough about how robust the K-3 is and the attention to quality.  For example, not only including a hood with the lenses, but also having a retractable slot in the hood to allow a CPL filter/lens to be adjusted without having to take the hood off.  I also like the opportunity to manually adjust the focus via the focus ring even when the lens is the A mode (unlike some unmentioned big name brands that do not allow that).

To begin with, I want to say that this review is not about the camera, but the experience of buying this camera from Amazon. The camera itself is amazing and I would definitely buy it again.I bought the Pentax k3 \"body-only\" from Amazon (sold and fulfilled by Amazon) and got the body-only, but in the body+lenses kit box with a sticker saying body-only. Even the warranty inside the box referred to the body+lenses kit. This is certainly weird, and made me think that this item was a \"grey market\" item, which is something that I would never expect from Amazon.I decided to call Pentax-Ricoh USA and check whether they would honor the camera's warranty. Pentax customer service informed me that some sellers buy camera+lenses kits and then break them down and sell them separately (really Amazon?). They also said that they would honor the warranty of the camera body that I bought if I present the seller's receipt.Here are my concerns about this:1- I bought a very expensive item sold as \"new\" and got an open box item that was broke down in two pieces.2- The item is not in original condition anymore, because Pentax-Ricoh don't sell \"body-only\" in boxes that say \"body+lenses\". That is certainly very annoying and one can imagine that, not having the original box for this item might depreciate it's value when it comes the time to sell this body and get an upgrade.I contacted Amazon, explained the situation and asked for a discount, which was denied, because the item is in perfect working conditions. The only option is to return it. I sincerely regret my decision to acquire Amazon gift cards to buy this camera, because now my money is stuck in Amazon's store. When asked about item depreciation, AMazon's customer representative told me that I could say to a possible buyer that I acquired the camera \"like that\". Well, I have no proof of that and Amazon also can't provide this proof for me as well. Besides that, I asked to Amazon if that camera came like that from Pentax and the answer was that \"Amazon buy the camera from the manufacturer and sends it to the buyer the way that they receive it\". Now, something is not true in this statement. As I said before, Pentax-Ricoh don't sell \"body-only\" in boxes that say \"body+lenses\".So, the take home message here is: save you some trouble and buy your camera in a local store (where you can actually see what you are getting) or from Pentax-Ricoh directly (or Canon, Nikon, etc...) .
