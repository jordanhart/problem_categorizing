I really appreciate the size and quality feel of this camera's construction, the intuitive controls, and all of the included accessories (Leica lens, lens adapter, lens hood, etc).  I was able to figure out the controls and start taking great pictures within a half hour of opening the box.As a novice but \"improving\" photographer, I love the adaptability of this camera.  Many light conditions can be overcome with just a few tweaks to the settings.  The shutter speed is also a godsend as compared to the Canon point-and-shoot models.  Just hold the button down and the rapid-fire shots pour into this camera.  I am also absolutely thrilled with the battery life - hundreds of pics on one charge!  This is a crucial improvement over the older cameras that absolutely devoured AA batteries.On the downside, this camera is bigger than a point and shoot so carrying it can be an issue.  Also, the internal memory is a joke, so I recommend that you buy a 2 gig memory card immediately.  With that card installed I can store well over 500 high quality shots.Basically if you are a no-fuss user, set it on simple mode and take a lot of great pics.  If you are more advanced and take the time to figure out ISO seetings, you can set up some VERY good shots with this camera.  I would never call it the be-all end-all digital camera but you will not find an equally good set of features without spending hundreds more.

Not just an excellent compact or point and shoot but an excellent camera period.  While not a complete replacement for an dSLR, the FZ8 is pretty darn close.  Given the current price in the low $200s, it is one of the best values in digital camera available.Details:  This is my 5th digital camera - 2 Nikons, a Minolta, and a Kodak.  Of all, the Nikons have the best picture quality but the Panasonic is not far behind.  The FZ8, besides being my newest is my new favorite for an overall camera.Physically its very easy to hold.  The shutter button is large and the zoom toggle can be worked easily without moving your hand much.  The mode selection dial is large, easy to read and easy to use.  Two minor issues with handling - I have a tendency to put my left hand over the auto focus assist light.  Only a big deal at night and something that I will eventually adjust to.  Second is on the opposite side.  I have managed to press some of the navigation buttons on the back of the camera with the palm of my had.  Again, not a big deal since Panasonic wisely choose to make the shutter button override any selection on the back panel.  One factor on handling - I have the lens hood adapter attached all the time.  It makes the \"lens\" longer and I think easier to hold.  More on this later.Picture taking is very easy in Program mode.  90% of what you will want to do is covered by Program.  Even if you want to use the Aperture, Shutter or Manual modes, you can use Program to pre-shoot to get \"default\" speed and aperture information which is displayed on screen.  The auto-focus is very fast during daylight and as fast as any I have used in low light conditions (as long as you don't cover the focus assist light!).  I was having some issues with close up focus until I found the selector for macro focus.  Problem solved.  The built in flash is reasonably powerful.  One drawback of the camera is the lack of a hot shoe or flash sync.  This limits the usefulness of the camera but if that is a feature you need, you probably need a full dSLR.  Unlike many digital cameras, the flash does not pop up automatically in low light conditions.  You must release it manually and once released, it powers very quickly.  At first I found this to be a drawback but the Optical Image Stabilizer is good enough to make low light shots possible.  More than making them possible, by not having the flash as a default, you avoid taking pictures of darkness from the flash bumping up the shutter speed but not being powerful enough to light the area.  The OIS makes pictures at 1/30 possible with little effort.  Using even the most basic stabilization techniques makes 1/15 possible with stationary subjects.  Beyond that is tough.  Indoor pictures, even with a room lit with halogen lights, tend to be yellow without the flash but they are relatively easy to clean up in Photoshop.  I haven't been able to tell the difference between the two modes for OIS in normal use.  The zoom is very fast and from 1x-6x there is almost no loss of detail.  At 12x there is noticeable fuzziness when you view at the pixel level but nothing you would not see on almost any other 400+mm lens.  OIS helps make 12x zoom actually useable in hand held mode.I don't have the space or the brain power for the full matrix of file and image sizes but at maximum (7 MP 3072 x 2304) size files come in at roughly 1.7MB at maximum JPG compression, 3.4MB for \"fine\" compression and 11MB for RAW.  The camera has 27MB of built in memory but given the file sizes, this is really only useful for emergencies.  Getting the pictures out and off the internal memory is quite a challenge at first - You can copy them to the memory card or pull them off using the USB connector.  If you have a card in, you can only copy them and you cant delete them unless you take the card out.  In fact, with a card in, you might never know there are any pictures in the camera.  This can be used for your benefit - take a picture of your contact information with the built in memory.  Protect the image.  If your camera is ever lost or stolen, you can identify it.  Write speed is good but not great on a 2GB 60x card.  RAW write times are noticeable in their lag.  Still, the FZ8 is far better than ANY Nikon I have used.  In fact, slow write speed was a major factor in NOT buying the new Coolpix P5000.  Same with stutter lag.  My Nikon CP5400 took stunning pictures but the shutter lag made it unusable for anything even remotely fast moving.  The FZ8 gets the shot and is ready for another before my 5400 would have finished focusing.  There are over 20 scene modes but most replicate post processing done in Photoshop so I prefer to shoot \"unprocessed\"  Two that I have used are Beach and Night and both work well at making exposure adjustments to prevent problems.Picture quality is excellent.  I read many reviews of the FZ8 with complaints of over processing and picture artifacts.  I have not had any complaints.  The first picture I uploaded of a sunset was taken with nothing more than a steady hand and the OIS.  At ISO 100 there are no artifacts.  It was pretty dark when I took this so I think it represents a good example of what the camera can do in low light.  This image was resized by 50% and at 50% additional JPG compression (Photoshop Elements 4.0 Mac \"Save for Web\").  The second shot is in shaded bright light.  It too was resized by 50% and at 50% compression.  You can see some artifacts from the internal processing but nothing that would make the picture unprintable.  Again, if you need more, buy a dSLR.  Remember what you are paying for!  The final picture is a slice of a RAW picture of flower.  Using Adobe Camera RAW v4.2 I made no changes (As Shot) then saved it as a 100% JPG.  The edge quality is excellent.  Movies are nice but frankly, buy a video camera to do movies.I have not used the provided software.  I use a combination of iPhoto (v6.0.6) and Photoshop Elements (v4.0.1) with Adobe Camera Raw v4.2.  No problems.Battery life is excellent.  In fact, it is the best I have ever used.  The battery charges very fast and I have not managed to run it down past two bars even on a 400 picture day.  The charger is small but is an outlet hog covering two outlets on a normal wall or power strip.  It has a flip out plug which is nice for traveling but not always the easies to plug in to odd shaped or placed outlets.  I have a small 3 outlet strip I travel with and that solves any issues with plugs.There is a single issue that prevents me from giving this camera stars.  The USB connection from the camera is the older 12Mbit/s standard rather than the newer 480Mbit/s USB 2.0.  Given the file sizes of the pictures, this is inexcusable.  For practical purposes, the only way to get pictures into your computer is to remove the memory card and use a reader.  This might not seem like a big deal but it is unnecessary.  I cannot imagine a reason for not putting USB 2.0 connections on the camera.  The FZ8 has some features only found on more expensive dSLRs.  With the lens hood adapter, you can attach\u00e9 a 52mm filter for protection and for special composition.  You can attach a macro lens for extreme close ups.  Given these \"pro\" features, lack of USB 2.0 is even more glaring.  Shame on you Panasonic!I bought the FZ8 as a bridge to a dSLR next year.  I needed a new camera but I think next years batch of dSLRs from Nikon and Pentax will be enough better that I wanted to hold off.  The FZ8 will probably do far more than bridge!  It has 75% of what you want out of a dSLR for less than half the cost when you consider the additional lenses you would have to buy to match the 36mm to 432mm equivalent zoom.  The size and weight are great for traveling and combined with a seemingly bottomless battery, I will probably be using it long after next year.  Despite the USB issue, highly recommended as the best value for your dollar by far.", "Date": "October 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera! Highly Recommended!", "Author": "M.

I had a beautiful picture of my backyard in which noise was really visible in a shadow, thus making the picture appear grainy in that area...and this was in good light.  If you're going to be limiting the printing to 4x6 or 5x7 and you don't look at the pictures full-size on your monitor, then this is the camera for you.  I would recommend it 100% for people like that.  I am not prepared to 'shoot in raw' and post-process either.  I don't have time for that.  Maybe some people do.  Raw also takes up quite a bit of space (11.3 Megs each), and the shot-to-shot time is around 5 seconds(maybe 4).The lens cap is nice and it comes with conversion adapter and lens hood.  All work great, although the conversion adapter is plastic and will get chewed up by inserting and removing over time (again, a 'value' camera).  If it weren't for the noise, I would have kept this camera. I like inspecting pictures on my screen, so I got frustrated when details like grass or foliage would be muddied up due to noise (or noise reduction, depending on how you have it set).The flash is nice, although it loses power quick.  You can't take more than 4 or 5 flash shots within a minute or else the power of the flash deteriorates.  You have to give it time for the battery to cool down.  In Panasonic's manual for this camera they indicate their flash performance is based on waiting 30 seconds between shots. Again, another value decision.The preset white balances are fairly inaccurate, at least under the lights in my house.  I had to use the custom white balances to get decent white-levels in my photos.  This is ok, except I always had to have a white piece of paper with me and set it manually.  The white-balance fine-tuning is pretty nice.As far as photo quality, there was very little purple fringing.  In fact, almost none.  I only saw some at the full telephoto zoom end at the corners of the picture.  Kudos to Panasonic for this.Corner blurriness and distortion was not an issue either.  This is an awesome lens.  It's just too bad the electronics inside the camera don't match the quality of the lens.  I would not take this camera above ISO 200.  I would not use it for indoor pictures (unless using the flash).  The optical stabilization works great though, so you can keep to ISO 100 more often than with other cams.I decided that there isn't an ultra-zoom on the market right now that lives up to my expectations.  The S5 IS is not very good due to lens distortion and purple(red)-fringing.  Alas I might have to do what the market dictates I must do and buy a D-SLR.", "Date": "July 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Smart and Fast Shooter", "Author": "Lawrence R. Hudson \"Fatherhonda\"", "ReviewID": "RCKWXIJ0MDNNL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned the FZ8K for about a week now, and I've taken about 2,000 pictures and videos with it.  It has many very good points and just a few not-so-good points.The good side:Pictures are sharp and clear.  The autofocus is smart and fast.  The standard settings for sharpness, contrast, and color intensity work well for me.  On previous cameras I had to use \"vivid color\" to get shots that I liked.Set it to fast burst and you get up to 5 pictures in what seems like about two seconds.  I've set the camera to operate silently, so that there are no clicking sounds to disturb my subjects.The anti-shake feature works well.  At mid zoom my hand-held videos are quite steady.  At max zoom the videos aren't so steady but I wouldn't expect them to be.  Still photos, however, taken on cloudy days, are sharp even at max zoom, which was a bit of a surprise.  But don't expect miracles - nothing helps if the light level is too low.The optical zoom feature is configured intelligently.  If you shoot at less than 7 megapixels you get added optical zoom past the nominal 12x out to, for example, 14.4x at 5 megapixels.  This is like cropping the central portion of the photo from 7 to 5 megapixels in an image editor, except that you don't have to shoot at 7 megapixels all the time (filling your HDD faster) to get that advantage.The lithium-ion battery is a champ.  I've taken over 400 shots, many with flash, before it even dropped from 3 to 2 bars.  I use a couple of Lenmar batteries as extras, and they seem to work as well as the OEM battery.The camera is reasonably small and light, and the two viewfinders work well.The flash is strong and charges relatively quickly.When you take a video the camera gives you a 640x480 jpeg of the first frame.  I find this useful in reviewing videos because Windows XP doesn't give you a thumbnail of the Quicktime video mov file as it does with avi and mpg video files.The not-so-good points:Somewhat slow downloads to the computer.  I've tried three cards in this camera.  Two of them were 2-gigabyte SD cards rated at 110x and 150x.  One is an 8-gig SDHC card rated as Class 6.  Although none of them gives the camera a write problem, they all read slowly through the camera cable.  I believe it is a USB 1.0 system.  This was a disappointment.  My older Canon SD-400 and Casio EX-S600 both download at USB 2.0, noticeably faster, even when the FZ8K is set to 5 megapixels.The 5-shot burst mode has no memory feature.  My old Minolta Z-2 has a feature that shoots continuously as long as my finger is on the shutter button, shows me each shot as it is taken, and then keeps only the last 5 when I release the button.  This saves memory-card space.  But I suppose, now that memory cards have gotten so big and so cheap, that the Panasonic way is not that much of a disadvantage.Learning to use some of the features required me to read the manual.  Not that great a hardship, but with other cameras I've been able to teach myself how to use them just by tinkering.Overall I'd say this camera is well worth the price, under $250 as of the time of this writing.  The Canon S5 is also worth considering, though it costs about $100 more.  It offers the option of optical zooming during video shooting, which is a nice feature.  I decided against it mainly because it uses NiMH batteries.

It had all the options I needed to be able to learn all I needed to know about manually adjusting your ISO,f stops, shutter speeds, and all that good stuff. It allows you to become an artist in the process and not just a button pusher, so it's better than a basic point and shoot. Also, it has RAW format which conserves more of the data for later use in Photoshop editing. It takes spectacular pictures in most settings and is a very good looking piece of equipment.Now, about the issue of VenusIII noise it does make me uncomfortable after 400 ISO but if you have a tripod or are a steady shot you should be able to pull of most shots, and can get by with the flash and a tripod at night or in low light. But, it is very good for a point and shoot. Some others may be better in low light but this one can take very good pictures for most of your shots and the Leica lens is super. Another gripe is that it does not have the field of view that I would have liked, which others have if you shop around. Over all I think it is a solid camera and if I could do it again I would have a hard time replacing it for the price.And no, in my experience with other peoples' cameras, it does not compare to a DSLR as many have said these advanced point and shoots can. If you are a really serious amateur and can afford an SLR get one. If you are unsure about your seriousness or want a comparable camera, in most situations, get this one. But, if the shot is in a difficult environment with low light you want an SLR.If I could do it all over again I'd save the money for an SLR. If you need one immediately for a class or just to learn there are cheaper cameras to learn on by Canon that have all the quality and features that you need to learn. If you are not serious and want to take pictures at BBQ's buy a simple point and shoot.

However, I decided to give it 5 stars for value.When I bought this camera, I put it head-to-head with the Kodak Z712 IS. The kodak is a good camera with comparable quality and features. I eventually decided that I enjoyed using the panasonic more because of its high quality LCD screen, included rechargeable long-lasting battery, variable speed zoom, better feel (IMHO), and manual focus (a feature I could not find on the kodak and do not believe it has). I also like that the ISO is hidden away in the menu; I don't accidentally change it while I am taking pictures in manual mode. The kodak takes less-noisy pictures but uses a longer shutter speed to do it.I really enjoy the portability of this camera. It weighs less than a pound and has a ton of features and options not found in a regular point and shoot. I like its intuitive controls. In the end, I decided the noise wasn't as big of an issue for me because I usually only print 4x6 photos. If I need to print bigger pictures, I can use Gimp (photo-editor) to easily soften the noise while preserving most of the detail. One major lacking feature in the panasonic is the inability to zoom (or shoot photos) during movie mode. If you cannot live without these features, do not get the panasonic.

What does that mean?  You really don't need to read extensively through the book to use it.  Charge the battery and use it right out of the box, it's that simple.Second, picture quality is amazing.  Even in simple mode, which is good enough for me!, the clarity is 100%.  I have no clue what the other reviews are talking about, complaining about noise. Even in simple mode, with the flash and backlight on (yes!! it has a backlight that turns on and off with the push of an arrow!) it takes bright, clear pictures.The best feature I love about this camera, is the automatic focus.  You push the button down, lightly, and the camera will focus itself on your subject, then give you a green dot to tell you to take the picture!  I paid $232 for this camera, which included shipping.  I am NOT disappointed.  I've had two other digital cameras, and paid around $200 each for them.  They are both simple point and shoot cameras.

It does have multiple / all delete mode, I just haven't figured that part out yet.  However, I just wish when I deleted a picture, it would stay in view mode, and not go back to 'camera' mode.

After working as a photographer since the late 1960's, I have all the cameras I need for studio photography, but wanted the look and feel of an SLR for my hobby and family shots. This camera delivered in every way.What sold it was the 12X optical Leica Zoom Lens, what kept it sold was the excellent photo quality. The options for exposure and automation are so complete and compelling that there might even be too many... simply put, this camera will do nearly anything I want to do and deliver top-quality images that can easily create 8X10\" photos.Among its other strengths is automatic metering that can be set to spot, averaging or center-weighted type. It has a superb Leica zoom lens equivalent to a 26 to 432mm lens on a 35mm camera. You can take rapid-fire multiple shots, automatically bracket exposure, and best of all, you are able to set metering for shutter-priority, aperture-priority, fully automatic or even auto-ISOPossible drawbacks for some people may include a slight learning curve for the settings, a tendency for the camera to seek too slow a shutter-speed in fully automatic mode inside with the flash off, and the fact that the zoom lens is SO strong that it is very difficult to hand hold over about 4X zoom. This last point is compounded by the surprisingly light weight of the camera. Overall, this camera is a gem and at an extremely low price for the feature set.I recommend purchasing one extra battery, a 2GB SD card, and getting a case. One word of caution, the filter set recommended by Amazon for this camera was the wrong size.

I started with a point-and-shoot Kodak, but it was obvious that that wasn't going to cut it.  I needed something that was easy and quick to use, but had a good assortment of manual controls.I tried the Kodak Z12is, but was unsatisfied with the image quality.  Sent it back and got a Lumix. Glad I did.The picture quality, especially at 100-200 ISO, is very good.  And, you can set the shutter speed and aperture manually, and you get a match-needle style meter (am I showing my age?) that gives you a +, - or 0 to center an indicator on.  I felt right at home after using my old Praktica back in the day.The zoom is truly amazing.  I think it's something like 38-432 in 35mm numbers.  Impressive for such a small package. Plus, it's got the renowned Leica lens.  In fact, Leica and Panasonic have cooperated on several cameras, so there might just be a lot of Leica in the Panasonic (or a lot of Panasonic in a Leica...either way, a good thing).It is also expandable...with the included extender, you can attach any 52mm accessories, such as polarizers and other filters.  Attach a Tiffen 3+ Close-Up lens and you get some pretty incredible macro ability. Plus, they make wide angle and teleconverters that will mount to the extender, further increasing the capability of this camera.On a tripod is where this camera really shines.  With a 60 second maximum shutter speed, this thing is ideal for long exposures, and even astrophotography, to a limited extent.Here's the thing; I originally got the Lumix because I wasn't sure if I would be interested enough in taking pictures to invest in a DSLR.  I didn't want to pay $800-1000 dollars for a camera to collect dust.It hasn't.  I've taken probably 2-3000 pictures with the Lumix since I got it 7 months ago...that's about 14 pictures a day, on average.Ironic now, that I'm looking for a new camera.  The Lumix has brought back my interest in photography, but can't satisfy it wholly.  I'm itching for better high-iso performance, interchangeable lenses, and a shutter with a bulb setting for longer exposures.  The Lumix is good if you make snapshots and occasionally want to do some more serious artistic shooting without lugging around a huge camera.  Not as much if you're a photo enthusiast who occasionally likes to do snapshots.Don't get me wrong.  The Lumix fulfills its purpose wonderfully as a bridge camera.  It can't replace a DSLR, but I'd still recommend it to anyone who's in the market for a point and shoot with great flexibility.  Definitely better than the Kodak Z12IS.If I didn't like it, I'd be selling it on Ebay.  As it is, I'm passing it on to a family member who's interested in learning more about photography.The proof is in the pudding.

While the reviews and price seemed good, the one bothersome problem I found was a lack of rechargeable batteries. Many users felt that they went through them rather quickly. I believe you can buy an optional charger and battery, but that then brings the price up to an unacceptable level for what you get.I searched for an alternative that was priced right and had a 10x to 12x zoom but not a full, DSLR.  The Panasonic Lumix FZ8K fit the bill.I recommended she take a look at the offer at Amazon that included the 2GB Kingston SD Memory card for $263.00 with free shipping.  She liked it and placed the order.The more I read the reviews and thought about the price, the more impressed I became so I ordered one for myself. (Plus looking at the sample pictures that were uploaded to Amazon helped too)I love gadgets, so I've been having a fun time going through all the menus/modes and reading the manual. I couldn't be more satisfied with the picture quality.  While all the reviews mentioned \"noise\" above the ISO level, this, to me is acceptable, as I don't go higher than that for the most part.  The same goes for the digital zoom -- usually pretty useless unless you have a need to capture something in the far distance and quality isn't essential.  But this is the case for any digital zoom.My daughter-in-law isn't technically inclined and doesn't like to read too far into the manual, so the Starter (heart) mode or the P (Automatic Exposure with more flexibility) mode pretty much gives her all the features she was looking for without having to fiddle with all the F Stops, shutters speeds, and ISO level.  The hardest thing she wants to do is zoom and hit the flash button to open the flash when needed.  She's very happy with the camera too.If you're not a purest and insist on options like interchangeable lens but still want a full range of manual settings -- or a simple point and shoot camera -- I'd highly recommend this one.Did I mention that Amazon's ordering process was simple and straight forward.

I would recommend to anyone not looking to spend much on an ultrazoom with a full set of features including RAW mode.The bad news first: beware of shooting indoors in low lighting. Way too much noise. The flash only helps if your subject is up close. The camera settings help with these inadequacies (eg. keep ISO 200 or 400), and any good photo editing software can make up for any weakness afterwards. But don't expect great low lighting shots everytime.Shots are absolutely awesome outdoors and in good lighting. It is very hard to justify buying other cameras for outdoor use when you can get this much optical zoom and versatility at such an affordable price. Believe me I know. I spent 4 months reading comparisons and oogling sample shots before I made the decision.Its main competition for price/features is the late Canon S3 IS. Colors are warmer with the Canon (indoor shooting only), but overall picture quality is not as good. Although the Canon's LCD swivels, it is much smaller and resolution is inferior. I also came across quite a few consumer reviews where they complained the Canon broke down prematurely in one way or another.Speed, battery capacity, and ease of use are as good as the best.

The fact of the matter is that the lens is amazing, and in low light you can't expect too much more than what you'll get from this camera...at least not for anywhere near the price.  I wound up landing the camera, two spare batteries and a 2 gig memory card for just over $300, and it's been worth every penny.The best part of the whole camera is its lens, far and away.  The 35mm equivalent of 36-436mm just can't be beat, especially with an aperture like this.  I sometimes wish it went a little wider, but that's a minor complaint.The noise is, in fact, pretty bad above ISO 800, but what do you expect with a sensitivity like that?  At high ISOs you're always going to have noise in a digital camera, just like you'll always have grain with film.  With this camera, though, the colors are still true and bright, even if you lose detail to the noise reduction.  You have to make sure to set the white balance manually a lot of the time though, because just like most cameras it is easily confused under indoor lighting.  That's easy though, and it pains me that so few people can be bothered to spend 10 seconds pointing their camera at something white to set the white balance.The camera is extremely compact and light, and the screen is great.  The extra modes on the screen are also quite helpful, particularly the high angle mode.  In high angle mode it adjusts the colors so that they look more natural when you're holding the camera above your head, very handy.  The one problem with a camera so small, though, is that I can imagine it being a problem for anyone with extra-large hands.  Mine are pretty big, and sometimes it does feel kind of dainty and hard to use.Probably my favorite thing about this camera, other than the lens, is the battery life.  The day I got it I charged all three batteries, and since then I've taken over 1000 pictures without using up even two of them.  Granted, I take a lot of outdoor pictures and hate to use the flash (I prefer grainy to flat from a camera-mounted flash), but that's still an impressive number of pictures to get out of not even two full charges.I highly recommend this camera to anyone who's looking for a full-featured camera but doesn't want to spring for a full-on DSLR.", "Date": "November 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Steady & well bulit Camera", "Author": "Ramesh \"Live Let Live\"", "ReviewID": "R17PSNMADI2W6B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned this camera when i had a problem with the Kodak Z712 IS.

I found myself continually trying to move up the digital camera ladder due to the lack of performance offered from previous cameras. I've come to some sort of agreement with myself now. I'm willing to give up ultra compactness, and other fine features offered in a point and shoot for more performance. And this camera by far exceeds my expectations. Considering the fact that this camera is a bit bulky (but not so much as to bare a huge burden of lugging this thing around) you wouldn't mind carrying it around due to what it can do.Where this camera shines:1)It simply takes great shots. After the initial learning curve of tinkering around to see what this camera can do, it really takes off. The option to take raw pictures as well is fantastic (the programs included with the camera actually work) and as a side note... It also saves the picture as a jpeg plus the raw you just took so you can see how the camera did as well. Very nice feature. As goes for night pictures, well thats a tough question to answer. Even the most expensive cameras won't do as well as you like. But it's decent, and it works. In the end, it just matters how well you can play with the camera to get better night shots.2)Movie clips it saves is high quality. It does a good job.3)Zoom is very fast, quiet, and highly efficient4)The electronic viewfinder is a very nice feature as well.5)Comes with optional add-ons (which are purchased separately) such as lenses that increases zoom, widens picture, etc. And they work well.6)It's no SLR but it takes pictures quickly when equipped with a ultra ii sd cardWhat I didnt like:1)The buttons feel clunky and a bit awkward to use. Not as intuitive as say my previous nikon cameras that I have used.2)The dial knob. Either you learn to love it, or you learn to hate it. I on the other hand hate it. It slows me down from switching from mode to mode since there is a slight lag when switching modes. Plus I don't know if in the long run its bad for the camera that I do that either. And since theres a slew of options that this camera has to run through, the dial mode has become a bit cumbersome for me.3)I would like the option of adding a hotshoe of some sort to increase flash (and give you that cool photographer look)4)Wish it actually had a mechanical lens cover rather than a clip on cover. But whatever.

After playing around with some of the features I was impressed with this camera. The FZ-8K takes fantastic pictures that are truly very sharp. What I'm most surprised with is the feature for close ups or macro. I was taking pictures of coins that were as good as my Canon D20. So small but packed  with so many features that blows your mind. I have taken this camera FZ8K outside and ran some test of my own to see what I could do with it. I took some pictures of some Finches that feed at one of my bird feeders. Took many pictures of some buildings and even went to the Zoo. Every picture came out perfect the bird pictures were so good that I had one made into a 5x7 and framed it. I have never used a Panasonic camera and I would have to say I'm impressed. I was so Impressed with the FZ8Kthat I also purchased a Panasonice DMC-L1.The image stabalizer works great it's not perfect but it will get the job done. I took a picture of the moon with out the use of a tripod came out nice. To sum this up if your in the market for a great camera that is easy to use and with more features for more advanced users look no farther. This can be a simple point and shoot or you are able to change many features to be more creative. I was never a fan of point and shoot cameras but when I sawthis camera on Amazon and did my home work. I read many reviews on the internet and made up my mind to give it a chance. I figured if I didn't like it I would sent it back to Amazon. After about an hour of playing with the camera the day it arrived. I new that this was a keeper in my book. It is small and I have big hands but fits me just fine. All controls for the FZ8K are easy to work when holding the camera. I bought a four gb memory card for it and a card reader. I no that this will never take the place of DSLR but the cost is a fraction and the results are and will amaze you what this little FZ8K can do. One thing maybe I can pass on is no matter what camera you are interested in read some reviews. I have never read a review on any camera that they have not found something wrong with it in some way. What I'm saying is there is no perfect camera out there. But I will say the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ8K is as close to perfect as I will ever find. You have to handle the camera fill all the controls the make your own mind up. For me one that has a couple DSLR I'm very happy with my little Panasonic FZ8K. Also Amazon also had the best price on the net. And they shipped it lighting fast. I have used a Fugi  point and shoot and a couple Canon point and shoot. My brother owns a Sony camera and loves it till he saw what the FZ8K can do and do it better. My pictures come out sharper more vivid and my zoom is a so much better. The Sony my brother uses cost 245.00 and is a little smaller andhe is able to put in a shirt pocket. Mine I can't but feature for feature mine blows his away. I'm very happy with the performance and features that are on this Panasonic. Give this camera a chance and it to will make you as happy as it has made me. A fantastic camera for not allot of money.

Imanaka \"David in Seattle\"", "ReviewID": "R2OG9AY6O3LAYN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a P&S; camera as a replacement for a long obsolete P&S; camera that was slow and half the mega pixels as the FZ8k. I have high mega-pixel cameras for my work and interchangable lenses that cost 4X the cost of this camera. I wasn't too interested in the brand or model, but wanted something that was versatile and simple enough to use for recreation. Having owned leica cameras in the past and currently own a Panasonic DVX100 videocamera, the Dicomar lens was of particular interest. So, I ordered the FZ8k. I will say, its delivery was scheduled for after Christmas, instead, it arrived yesterday (24th) in time to charge the battery and take it to a holiday dinner party (way to go Amazon.) At the party, I wasn't even the first person to use it, but a party guest who was curious about it started snapping pictures. Talk about ease of use right out of the box!The images were all acceptable for the occasion even with the lack of familiarity. It is a camera for the average consumer who wants to get the most bang for the buck without the hassle, but I'm sure most P&S; cameras offer hassle-free operation, but the FZ8k for the money is certainly a bargain especially with the Leica (licensed?) lens.There are alot of extended features in this camera for the those interested in taking the time to expand their picture taking interests, but what I've seen so far, it's an excellent camera to capture the moment.As far as the 'noise' a few have noted, all digital cameras whatever price will exhibit noise under specific conditions and this camera may be more excessive than others, but for 99% of the average picture taker the results should be more than acceptable. For the others who are critical of this aspect, should explore and find a camera acceptable for their requirements (and most likely pay more.) You can spend hundreds more, even a thousand more for a camera, and still end up with noise if you don't exploit the camera's sweet spot, but for $200 plus the features, this is a good deal hands down.Personally, I never thought I'd ever own a Panasonic digital still camera, but now I do and am pleased with the results so far. Other brands I own or have owned (digital and film) include: Nikon, Rollei, Hasselblad, Leica, Fuji 680, Mamiya and Contax.

Other reviewers will get more technical, I was more concerned with the basics. I definately recommend a 2mb or higher card as the internal memory is only a couple of pictures. I was concerned with the battery as I prefer conventional batteries over proprietary ones. It is easier to find a gas station or drug store when the batteries go dead than carry a charger and look for an outlet. Therefore I did purchase a 2nd battery, but I have not been in a situation that I have run out of juice and needed to use it. The battery life is great and can get us through a weekend of heavy use or a week as an average tourist.The upgrades I seeked from our previous was:faster powerupfaster shutterfaster flash rechargefaster recovery between shotseasy to usebetter lens.This camera delivers on all the above.A great camera for a beginner or spouse looking to point and shoot, and plenty of options for those wanting to experiment a little more before taking the big plunge into a true SLR. As with other cameras in this price range, the pictures can get noisy/grainy at the higher ISO settings. It is best to set it in auto mode unless you know what you are doing.It is a great camera for the price. While other cameras offer 10+ megapixels, I would rather have the zoom. If the MP chip is not quality, all you get is noise and poor pictures. Most people don't need anything more than a 6-8MP camera because they will never print their pictures or print them larger than an 8x10. For those consumers, like myself, this is a terrific option.

I loved the shots I took with it and so did everyone that saw them. Especially viewing the whole image.As is mentioned most places the noise reduction is overly heavy handed and when you zoom in and view the images at 100% (view pixels) they don't look so hot. Detail is smeared etc. BUT, you can shoot RAW files with this camera and therefore control the noise reduction, sharpening, white balance, and exposure tweaks on your computer.The more you master this camera the more it will make you want a true digital SLR, to take care of the few things that this camera is not great at. Examples: not fast enough autofocus for fast-moving subjects (birds in flight); shutter lag, while not terrible I still got the back of my child's head rather than the front more often than not; depth of field: there's too much! With the aperture wide open everything still seems pretty sharp. I was unable to get much background blur, and bokeh is more or less nonexistent. High ISO (film speed): this camera really doesn't look very good shot at faster than 400, and not very good at 400 either. The shots really only look good at 100 ISO.If I had it to do over again I would have tried to get at least the cheapest Canon Digital Rebel, which NOW are easily less than $600. Instead, last year I upgraded to a Canon EOS 40D, and there's really no comparison. If you're old enough to have used a film SLR well, then you HAVE to get a DSLR. Everything will feel natural again. If you're not that old, or don't care about those things and just want a long lens, then this is, or was, hard to beat.If you are really interested in photography and want to learn and study the art form, then you really want a digital SLR.

Superb pictures but the only thing I do not like is the lens is frozen when you take video.  It doesn't zoom in or out.

A 12x zoom lense, RAW capture mode, and wide selection of manual and automatic modes make this camera very flexible.  You can set the ISO (low light sensitivity) for this camera, can run in full auto, full manual, aperture priority, shutter priority, plus an assortment of \"scene\" modes that let you optimize for different conditions.  There's also an \"easy\" mode for photographers that don't want to mess with all those settings.Image quality is very good, as long as I stick to the lower ISO settings; especially at the ISO 100 setting, the resultant images are very clean and detailed.  As it true with any camera that uses a small imaging sensor, low light performance is somewhat limited -- but that's not a problem that is limited to this camera, since virtually all of the competing cameras in this price range use similar sized sensors.One other notable feature is the speed of this camera.  If you've only previously used \"point and shoot\" digital camera, you'll be amazed at how fast this camera takes a picture when you press the shutter button.  If you halfway depress the shutter button first (which engages the autofocus and autoexposure), depressing the button the rest of the way will give you virtually instantaneous pictures -- the wait is so short I can't distinguish it.

I was most nervous about the quality of the video and audio.  In the end, I was surprised with the video and audio results.  In one video some of the students where standing on some some red rock formations in Southern UT singing.  I was 150 feet away and also below them outdoors and the audio was clear.  I was surprised.  Throughout the four days, I used every setting the camera has.  And to think I didn't have to change a lens!  My DSLR would have been a handling nightmare trying to catch candid action shots of the students.  One disappointment with this model is that you cannot change the zoom while shooting video.  Of, course the DMC-FZ28K has that feature.  I also want Panasonic to add a hot shoe feature to the camera line so I could use a tilt and swivel flash.  I love Panasonic cameras, excellent value and great results.

Fz8 cons-Though nice and light has a bit of a toyish feel, movie records in mp4 which needs apple quicktime to play (most cameras film in avi which is much more universal), no zoom while filming, although battery has great life it only fits this camera (no stopping at store for fresh AA's).

Tom in Texas writes this...\"low light performance is somewhat limited\".I say \"very limited\". It's been my frustration that when I take indoor shots, it's very poor quality. Especially evening time. Noise? I think so, but for me, real issue is when I use the flash. Photos turn so blue-grayish. I compared w/my fossil Fuji(written below). Even w/that Fuji, flash used, it does not look that blue. So far that's really disappointing, but in the day time, in door, looks ok, but not great.I won't return the camera though, since it takes great outdoor shots. Fits nice in hands, too.-Dec.27thI got this camera less than 10 days ago as a Xmas gift to myself. After I did some research on similar items, and owning a Pentax p&s;, Fuji finepics6900(it's a fossil DC), I settled w/FZ8. It does take great shots. I've taken some pics I really like. At least this camera filled my expectations.While it takes great scenery pics, I'm not so satisfied with portraits I took. I've been trying different settings and modes, but not quite there. Maybe that's why Lumix came up with \"face detection\"  on FX18, a newer model. But, by looking at pics taken by the two machines, I don't think there is much difference.Battery life is excellent. Buy extra one though, and you'll be all set. The \"hood\", I love it! I go to beaches often, so this item is a must for me. I think  video is pretty good, too. Very clear. It looks like it can record upto 22mins. w/a fully charged battery.My pentax vid wasn't this good. Fuji didn't even record sound!Like someone wrote, usb code could be pain if you have to upload a lot of pics, say, more than 300. I may purchase a sd card reader. I think stabilizer does its work, but sometimes I have to wonder how good that is. With this camera, I became to like using a tripod. This camera is an excellent learning tool for someone like me, a novice in photography and wants to learn more and be better at it. With all the functions, battery life and the items it comes with, you can't beat this price! Recommended!PS,To James E. Sink \"Sound Man\", thanks for sharing your photo info on your Moon pic.

Still (non moving) shots were decent, point and shoot shots were okay to but to be honest my old cheap Kodak hundred dollar point and shoot took better shots. The thing that really made me send the camera back was low light shots with any motion at all in any mode were terrible. I experimented in all creative modes and pre set modes, low light shots were all awful: blurred and a lot of noise even still shots with flash off had tons of noise. I just bought the Canon XTi DSLR...an amazing camera!!!...All I can say is Perfect! Save your money, pay $300 more and get the Canon XTi.

Amazon doesn't sell the charger, they can sell you a new battery however (???).
