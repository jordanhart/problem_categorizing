{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good camera, but not worth the money", "Author": "Frack", "ReviewID": "R28LP1XULFTK7Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera with two others. This was the most expensive camera (the others were $40 and $50).  This camera is very large compared to others.  That might be good if you want to draw attention to the camera.  It is easily 4-5 times bigger than some other CCTV cameras I've looked at and bought.  It does a good job.  Like most cameras, it has issues with colors.The camera is just okay.  It's not worth the price.  You can get an equally good camera for half the price.  While the video quality and adjustable zoom are nice, the night vision sensor is very sensitive.  I am  using the camera inside and it turns on the LEDs and goes into night vision mode even in the day with multiple lights on in the room.  I need to open the blinds and let the sun in on it to get it to turn off night vision.  Indoor lighting is not enough.  I have another camera in the same room and it has no problem with room lights.Being able to adjust the focus is nice in theory, but it is super sensitive.  You barely touch the screw in the back and the focus changes noticeably.  It makes it hard to fine tune.  It was shipped with a separate microphone which was nice, but I've bought these elsewhere for around $5-$10.This is a good camera for $40 - $50.  For $100 it is a waste since it is no better than other options out there.  You can get a much better camera for around $50.  In particular, I would recommend this one.  I bought 3 cameras to start and ended up buying 2 more of these:VideoSecu Bullet Outdoor CCD Security Camera Day Night 26 IR Infrared LEDs With Free Power Supply 1Z8Don't get me wrong - I like the camera and am still use it.  I just wish I hadn't spent $100 on it.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great quality and Great buy!", "Author": "RickyC", "ReviewID": "R281MV9UZYL8KB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its very easy to set up. It doesn't record or rotate but for the price you can measly pop in a blank DVD or VHS to record. It really does have an amazing picture quality! I was expecting to receive it in a week and that's even when it said it would arrive but I got it in like 2 days!!! I love this camera", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "Charles M.

I was so pleased with their operation, that I just ordered another. I was surprised, the amplified microphone worked pretty well. The IR lights really did their job too! The investigation will be on my ufonut website.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "One Big Mutha!", "Author": "David J. Murphy", "ReviewID": "RMRNFZX5Y58BA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This folks, is the mamma jamma of all surveillance cameras!  If using for home security make sure you have enough mounting space!  Performance wise, it pretty much runs with the pack, not out in front of it.  Precise focusing is pretty much a a hit or miss crap shoot but once zero'd in the picture is crystal clear.  Out of the box, the color rendition needs a little tweaking but can be corrected with mostly any monitoring software.  The supplied microphone cable is extremely fragile so must be installed with great care.  The audio quality is a bit tinny but acceptable.  Sensitivity is on the high end but with a program with a gain control it can be adjusted.  All in all a great product.  I have two different cameras from VideoSecu and both do their job without question. Customer Service is top notch!", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not bad for the money", "Author": "Livin' Life", "ReviewID": "R1FN0Y930CLQ3O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Installed this camera over my driveway to watch my vehicle. Daylight picture is nice but not as sharp as I had hoped. At a distance of about 20 feet and at best focus I was unable to read a 3x4\" inspection sticker on my car. The night vision does provide an acceptable picture in total darkness but is a lot more on the blurry side then the daylight picture. If you have to balance quality with cost, this is a decent choice and I would problably buy again.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "eyespy", "Author": "pitterpat", "ReviewID": "R31DFBVT69SCW1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great night vision awesome picture quality and is very easy to install for the that has basic construction knowledge.

This isn't some little tinker toy. You are going to need some space for this big boy. There are no instructions, so you are on your own as far as the installation. I have yet to figure out how to get the microphone to work, but the camera is great for the price. I can see everything at night with little help from the 56 IR lights. The street light gives off enough light so everything is still in color. I guess that I'm going to need 7 more of these. Sound update! It works great! Just needed to do a little plug inspection and it works great. I bought a little wind cover for it.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good camera, no sound.", "Author": "nissanpon", "ReviewID": "R2DZFDNVRODZAW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Easy installed, the camera features are really good, have not been able to set the sound, maybe it is not working.

It has real good night vision at a good distance! The camera has a little controle moduel made into the cord... This is the tricky part! All the fancy adjustments are done through this moduel!!! At the camera... before you mount it!! I was lucky that this camera was being mounted by my bedroom window so that I could look through the window and see the menu pop up for the on screen adjustments.. It even has backlight adjustment so that lights or even parking lights reflecting the inferred back on the screen is blacked out to not interfear with the picture quality! A trick for good night vision from any camera mounted under an eve.. Don't let the eve be in the picture! The inferred reflicts back in the camera off the eve and throws off the picture quality! I found this out after I made my adjustments and mounted it... The picture looked like crap... after it just looked so good, tell I moved it down and BAM! Theres my good picture again! One other tricky thing with this camera is like any other adjusting camera.. The focusing! VERY TOUCHY!!! But thats all camera's with these adjustments with my experience and what I've read from others. And yes... those are the adjustments on bottom in plain view in which is convenient for us doing the adjustments, but can be bad for for someone else to miss with if they new what they were looking at! Even with the few issues, I still see this camera well worth 5 Stars!", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Comment", "Author": "Luis Gonz\u00e1lez", "ReviewID": "RKLICKMT3J1NH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good article.

Briers", "ReviewID": "R7HMNQ0IDAI5M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera was shipped super fast and to my surprise it was at my house in two days. I ordered this camera to replace an aging camera that we used to watch the vehicles in the drive way and to supervise the kids outdoor play activities. This is a fairly large/good sized camera, but the extra or larger internal electronics of this camera displays excellent day vision clarity, and the night vision is truly amazing. The 54 infared Leds automatically come on at night  and low light conditions, thus seeing in the dark unassisted is not a problem for this camera.  I had a problem installing  the external audio and the seller worked with me through emails until I got it installed and working correctly. The audio is external on this camera and now that I understand how it works, I prefer it that way. This camera can see out a  fair distance, but I wanted it to see up close. The ability to adjust the focus and the zoom is another excellent feature. You can adjust the camera until you get the picture just perfect at the distance you want.  The day light picture looks just like watching TV. The night picture is the best I have ever seen. This is an excellent camera for the money.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "works sometimes", "Author": "bert", "ReviewID": "R1DBNFU89ISPD6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i just recieved this camera and it will turn on then turn off. if i un plug the adapter for a few minutes it will turn back on, then off. i'll be returning it for a refund.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$640.45", "Features": "Built-in 1/3\" Sony Effio CCD security camera, Color DSP\n700 TV Lines horizontal resolution, NTSC System.
