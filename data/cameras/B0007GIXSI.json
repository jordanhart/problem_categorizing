I had been debating between this and several other superzooms.  I chose the Fuji for its ISO capabilities and its real photo technology.Pros:-Great looks and build.  You know this camera has quality written all over it from the moment you pick it up.-Fast shot to shot times.-Good auto focus capability, though not the best in its class.-Good movie mode with 640 X 480 capability.-Incredible High ISO capability!  This is where the Fuji stands heads and above its competitors.  You can actually use come pcitures at 1600 ISO with a little work.-Excellent pictures in auto mode for a beginner.  This is a great camera for someone wanting to learn how to use digital cameras.  You can start off in auto mode and experiment with many manual settings.Cons:-Manual focusing is awkward to use.  You have to hold on to 1 button and then move the zoom in or out to focus.-The menus are a little more difficult to use than others I have tried, though you get used to it like anything else with practice.-No optical stabilization.  This is not really a con in my book due to its high ISO capabilities but some would argue the point.-No hot shoe.In the end, Fuji has taken and enhanced the S5100 in several ways to create a bargain of a camera the 399.00 price.  Highly recommended!", "Date": "October 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good camera, but be aware what you are buying", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"jumbuk\"", "ReviewID": "R36LUJN45BHIDG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is relatively new, so there are not many reviews in cyberspace yet.  However, some diligent searching will reveal a few.  They generally fall into the \"unbelievably good\" category, but when you read the details you find the user has had the camera for only a few days, or it is their first camera.  There are a few quite negative reviews, including some posted images of poor quality.I have had mine for a few weeks, and have mixed feelings about it.  Yes, it does have all the features that others have listed, and it offers very good value for money.  However, you need to understand what it is doing if you are going to take good pictures.  If you just \"point and shoot\", you may be disappointed.The S-5600 has a very long zoom, but no image stabilisation.  Unless you use a tripod, you may find it hard to get sharp pics at the extended settings.  The \"anti-blur\" setting works well, but at the expense of sometimes undesirable ISO levels.  IS would be better.Also, you need to be careful about focusing.  The autofocus sometimes misses small subjects.  You need to diligently use the \"pre-focus\" half-shutter option to make sure your subject is in focus before completing the shot.Focusing would be less of an issue if manual focus was easier.  I would prefer a simple focus ring, like on an SLR.  Failing that, it would be better if you could hold down a button with your left hand rather than trying to hold it down with your right hand while also operating the zoom buttons to manually focus.  Also, manual focus is very slow - you might not think it is working sometimes.  Plan to learn how to use manual focus, and practice using your right hand - not so difficult once you have it down, but again not \"point and click\".Ok, so this sounds like a pretty negative review so far.  Let's look at some of the positives - and there are plenty:- Very good lens system, with huge zoom range- Ability to screw on converter lenses - a wide angle is probably the most useful- Really long battery life - leaves the Canons for dead (always been a good feature of Fuji)- Once you understand and master the controls, ability to take great natural light photos (I find the flash a bit harsh)- Very good movie quality (but no zoom in movie mode)- RAW mode!- Good price!In summary, if you are in the market for a new camera of this type, definitely consider the S-5600, but see if you can get a hands-on trial against a Canon or Olypus equivalent before you commit to it.", "Date": "November 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable Camera!", "Author": "Jamil Soni Neto \"Jamil\"", "ReviewID": "R2M1IGLYJGTHES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well,\ufffd@I am not a pro but I will try to write something about this camera for those who are trying to decide if they will buy it or not...I bought this camera after analysing the reviews of S5200's antecesors; S5000 and S5100.Both were top sellers and every one (or almost) liked their performance. I also analysed if it was better to buy the strong competitor Canon S1 IS. For my need I chose to buy one of the Fujis.After reading some reviews about the S5000, some complaining and seeing that the complaining was much less on the Fuji S5100, I decided that the latter would be a great idea had not I done more research. I saw that the few complainings on S5100 would not (probably) be in its up-graded version (S5200) and some nice features would be included, too.In the site of Fuji I saw that S5200 would come with their newest kinda sensor (5th generation). Also it would come with Anti-blur (comparable to Canon's Image Stabilizer) and with the Real Photo Tecnology.Despite having it only for one week now, I have to say that I am very satisfied with the camera. It was a bit expensive but worth every Yen (I am in Japan, the first place where it had its premiere). I took some shots at night with surprising results, such as those Fuji promissed in their homepage. The Real Photo Tec is really good; instead of a dark and impenetrable background in night shots, you can have a vision of how the party was like. If you know how to use the camera, you can even get many details that I doubt you would ever get with another camera but S5200.The Anti-blur works fine. It is pretty good to take telephoto shots without a tripod and even for moving objects.The ISO have a reduced amount of noise even in its highest; ISO 1600. Unbelievable!The camera is pretty simple to use and the pre-programed functions are very useful with great results. If you just wanna have it to great snapshots, that is the camera.Even if you wanna have a special effect, after reading the manual, the camera does what you want it to. The features are very nice.Everything in the camera was thought, rethought and usually you can have what you want in a fingerful.Cons: I didnt like the difficulty of manual focusing and the EVF (though I dont have much experience with other digital cameras and dont know if it could get much better);The camera could have more options of aperture.Out of the cons, the camera is worth for a non professional like me that are begining with photography and needs some nice features.Some people ask if buying Fuji S9000 would be a beter idea. Need you more pixels, are you a professional (or at least know what White Balance, Aperture, Shutter Speed, ISO, Metering are and what they work for) and have more money to spend, then I would say that it be nice. Otherwise, if you are like me and just wanna practise with a good digital camera that many people will envy for its qualities, then you dont ever need to think about another camera.I may not here be able to say how good Fuji S5200 is but I really love it and would not change it.", "Date": "September 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great, Versitile, Powerful, Ultra-Zoom Camera", "Author": "T. Frink", "ReviewID": "R2I3HS4RQ0YYA8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent the weekend playing with my camera's features...doing my best to try them all..and taking over a hundred pictures in the process.  Here are my results in no particular order:SUMMARY: What a camera for the price!! At just over $200, it does more than I'll ever need it to.  And it's half the price I paid for my 4M Olympus Camedia C4000Z 3 years ago. I'm still getting used to which functions are available with buttons and which are in the menu. GREAT CAMERA that does almost everything you can with an SLR (except change lenses, which is a hassle I'd rather avoid). HIGHLY RECCOMMENDPROS:1. BATTERY LIFE: good to average2. FOCUS: Fast to focus, except at the outer edges of zoom in low light.3. ULTIMATE CONTROL: You can have as little or as much control over the image captured as you want.  I took one (very dark) night shot of wet leaves lit by my porch light with a 15 second shutter speed.  Of course, you can also intentionally take out of focus shots.4. HIGH ISO AVAILABLE:  Good to have available when you need it. Took one night shot of the cityscape at ISO 800 and got a good 4\" x 6\".5. CONTINUOUS MODE:  Comes in 4 varieties to help you get the shot when your own timing isn't so good.  First 3 shots, last 3 shots, one I can't remember, and Long-period (shoots up to 40 consecutive shots).  Long-period would seem to be an easy way to build a panorama photo series.6. RAW: Shoot in this format is good to have when you don't want pixels lost to compression. All editing must be done post-conversion.  You can then edit the TIFF and re-save it either as a JPEG or TIFF.7. MANUAL FOCUS: In Manual mode you can change anything. I even intentionally took a picture out of focus just to prove I could.  Manual focus is, of course, rather slow (as expected), but is effective as long as the subject isn't mobile. Easier to use with LCD screen.  Even when auto focus failed (!AF displays), I could manually bring the subject into focus).8. WEIGHT: It is incredibly light, and seems lighter than my old Olympus Camedia 4000Z, even though its manual says it's heavier.9. FEATURES: All the features I can conceive of using with several that I've played with but don't think I'll ever use.10. ZOOM: Coming from 3x optical zoom to 10x...what can I say?  WOW!  Be cautious, however at the far end of that range in lower light.  You'll need a steady hand, tripod or to switch to anti-shake mode.11. 2 SEC TIMER: Love that for the tripod/night shot. No long waiting for the shot.12. STARTUP TIME: Starts up almost instantly and is immediately ready to shoot.CONS:1. HIGH ISO:  On full auto, camera will select above 400 ISO values. Above 400 pictures become more grainy and 4 x 6 is the largest higher quality print you can get. If you want a high quality night shot, you'll have to select ISO 400 or lower and set it on a tripod/shelf/whatever to get the shot.2. RAW CONVERSION: The provided program only converts the RAW to a TIFF without editing.  Would have been nice if I could have \"edited\" the RAW version and then saved to TIFF just once. Also would have been nice to be able to save to more than just TIFF.3. SLOW MANUAL FOCUS: The pace at which manual focus changes is dreadfully slow.  Don't even try using it on a moving target.  Would be nice if it incremented faster when the button is held down for over a second and then you could slowly fine-tune the focus one button press at time. But not how they implemented it.4. LIMITED SAVE QUALITY CHOICES: My Olympus let me save to TIFF and about 10 different JPEG quality settings, varying pixel density and compression settings.  I used to use the highest quality only for portraits or shot I knew I was likely to enlarge. This camera only offers 5 still settings, only one of which is a 3:2 aspect ratio.UPDATE ON DURABILITY: I have been using this camera for 6 years now and it still works just like new. I have taken it to Costa Rica and travelled cross country several times with it on camp across America trips. It still works just great. Hands down, the most reliable camera I have ever owned.", "Date": "July 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best Camera for $pending money", "Author": "Julynn", "ReviewID": "R1KJTSYV11FTF2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did research on digital cameras for about six months before I settled on this one.  My considerations were a) image quality, b) price, and c) usability.Let's start with usability:  I mean \"usability\" in the sense that whether the camera had all the features I needed and none of the ones that I didn't.  I know, there's no such thing as too many features, but I'm not a professional.  I know enough about photography to understand the technical aspects of shooting good-to-great pictures, but don't care enough to invest oodles of money into a camera that has millions of features that I'll never use.  In that sense, the S5200 was a good buy.In terms of price, when I bought mine, it was just shy of $300.  I considered it a good deal, since the local camera store sold it for $400 (I know, I should support local merchants, but saving $100 is quite an incentive when you're a student).  I hadn't planned to spend more than $500 on the camera.Image quality was an important consideration, since I often get enlargements.  This camera will let you go up to 8 x 10 (I know it says 13 x 17, but then you run the risk of fuzz) and still maintain perfect clarity.Other considerations:  the learning curve for this camera is a bit steeper for those of you who are just coming out of the point-and-click 35mm and/or disposables.  The manual is helpful in explaining what all the features enable you to do, but it doesn't explain, for instance, that if the A number gets bigger, that actually means the aperture gets smaller.  Still, once you get the hang of it, it's amazing what you can do.Some things are adjusted automatically, others are not.  The ISO number will remain on whatever setting you have it on until you change it, for instance.  This is both a boon and a curse.  If you're shooting a lot of pictures under similar conditions, it's great.  If you're shooting pictures under vastly different conditions, it's a pain.  On the other hand, the aperture and shutter speed are adjusted automatically to what the camera thinks are good for the setting, and you can tweak them.The manual focus is a pain in the ass to manage, because neither the EVD nor the LCD screen are large enough for you to notice any change in the focus depth.  However, the autofocus works beautifully, and I would recommend that you stick with this.", "Date": "May 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Exceeded My Expectations", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2VGPSF1J4LXJG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got my S5200 last September through Amazon.  I was upgrading from a HP Photosmart 320 (low MP point-&-shoot) and didn't know much about this class of camera.  Most of my camera time is spent getting shots of my 17 month-old son and the HP was not keeping up.  After extensive research, reviewing an endless stream of customer and semi-professional reviews, I took the plunge and ordered this one.I like the construction of this camera.  I found that for the price and features (and % of positive reviews), the closest comparable camera was the Kodak Easyshare Z740.  The Z740 and several other similar class cameras all had the cheesy gray plastic shells that most cell phones have.  This makes them seem flimsy and delicate.  The black, hardened plastic of this Fuji, coupled with the rubberized grip around the lense tube (for lack of a better term) give this camera a sturdier feel and more professional appearance.Since I am not an experienced photographer and only have experience with low-end point-&-shoot cameras, I spent a lot of time with the owner's manual.  I am inclined to figure out most new gadgets with ease, but the many settings and features of this camera are scattered amongst different buttons and on-screen menus in an illogical manner, so I needed help.The auto mode meets most of my needs in good light and is fair in low light without the flash.  Outdoors in sunlight, high speed movement is captured well with no blur.  I tested this by photographing cars traveling 65+ miles on a nearby freeway and experienced no blurring (not even on their wheel rims).  You will need to keep the camera still or on a tripod in low light to minmize blurring and attain an accurate autofocus, but for this price range, it is reasonable.The long zoom is VERY cool and reveals a wide range of details in distant subjects that are hidden from the naked eye.  A full zoom roof shot of a highrise building several blocks away and in the last stages of construction revealed previously invisible construction personnel on scissorlifts, unnoticed ladders, and the a/c unit mounted on the side of the cab of one of the work site's tower cranes.  So cool...While the highest ISO setting is 1600, I have found that for my purposes, 400 seems to yield the best results with the least amount of high-res grainy fuzz or \"noise.\"  Most of my shots are taken using the auto mode with the autofocus, but I am learning more about the benefits of using the manual focus while adjusting the exposure time.  As time allows, I'll learn how to use the manual aperature settings to my advantage.The manual focus is not well designed and kept me from giving this camera 5 stars.  When another button that works like a keyboard's \"shift\" key is held down, the zoom buttons act as the focus controls.  Instead of a fluid transition, the focus advances and retards very slowly in small increments that are audible if you listen closely.The awful decision by Fuji to include an XD memory card that is only 16 pathetic megabytes is very disappointing.  You won't come close to this camera's full potential until you upgrade to at least a 512 megabyte card.  This will yield approximately 220 photos in the highest (non-RAW) resolution settings.  The video feature isn't even worth using until you upgrade this card.The video mode is actually pretty good.  My 512 card allows just over 7 minutes of good quality video with non-stereo sound.  I continue to acquire great and humorous clips of my son being himself.If you are new to this class of camera, I recommend budgeting in a decent but inexpensive case (Samsung from Walmart?), a tripod, and a lense cleaning kit.  My son has a habit of smearing his greasy fingertips on my lense when I loom in too close to get a good shot, so the cleaning kit was a must.If you're a professional and looking for a money-making camera, this camera is on the low end of the spectrum and not for you.  If you are a hobbyist or amateur who is on a real-world budget, this camera is a great investment.I still have much to learn about this camera and its potential.  There are many features that I cannot yet speak of intelligently, but I expect to unlock their secrets and further improve the quality of my photos.

On the automatic setting, it takes incredible photos, but has the capability to go manual if you are so inclined.  For the price, there is nothing on the market that comes close.  The macro on this camera is great and the close ups I have taken even on the automatic setting are unbelievable.  If you are looking for something that is SLR like, but not the SLR price, this comes close.  Of course, the SLR's will take better photos if you are an expert, but if you are an amateur or intermediate photographer and want something that gets the job done, put this one on your list...taking the price into consideration this thing doesnt disappoint.

Harbor", "ReviewID": "R1S37CS0HLJKVO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about 3 weeks ago.  I get hired by schools and families to take pictures of highschool athletics teams.  I decided to upgrade from my  Kodak C340 to this when I started getting more requests and jobs.  It's got great capture quality, some of my photos the schools have blown up for posters to 20'' by 30'' and the quality is great.  It's manual shutter setting is good for action shots, it does bursts shots which is fine for what I do.  Low light pictures come out fine with the adjustable ISO (goes up to 1600), shutter speed, and other manual control options.Colors are very vibrant and true.  Good battery life, runs on AA.  Very quick start up time, barely more than 1 to 1.5 seconds tops.  As stated in other reviews manual focus is a little awkward to use at first, but like they stated you get used to it.  Another great quality is the cameras ability to capture in the RAW format, and of course you can lower the quality to different megapixels if you want as well.All my research on this camera before I bought made me a little unsure if this was the camera for me, I was considering buying the Canon Powershot S2 IS 5MP Digital Camera.  But the more I researched it, most people seemed to say one of 3 things about the two cameras, they would say: picture quality is virtually the same, that the Fuji had the Canon beat because of it's high ISO capability, or the Canon had the Fuji beat because of the 12x zoom (the Fuji only has 10x).For me the low price on this one made it worth the buy, but if you really want a Canon, this is not the camera for you, because it's not a Canon, and doesn't operate like one.

This is the most underrated and reviewed camera around.  I purchased it to replace the vaunted sony dsc-h1 that was sent back because it was a lemon.  However this is so much more than a point and shoot model.I have owned the whole s series and moved to what I thought was up when I purchased the Panasonic fz 20.  True the Panasonic is still considered the \"Gold\" standard but this little wonder is pure magic in my hands.It is not an easy camera for a beginner to master but once you work with it lives up to its manufactuers claims.  The low light shooting function coupled with and ISO range from 64 to 1600 with the best noise reduction in the prosumer market make it a must have.As with any of this brakets cameras there are trade-offs and there is no sense comparing this to a digital slr as it is unfair but if you want the benefits of shooting in natural light and having a camera to grow with you with a beautiful lens and features not even available on the higher priced models invest in this baby.  For well under 400 little smackers you are getting not only anti shake which in this camera is adjusting the settings so that shake is mitigated by and increase in speed but the natural light function and maual controls that are sophisticated and professional.Though there is no physical manual zoom lens the focusing ooptions on this camera belay that minor loss.All in all a superb camera at an unbelievable price for someone who wants to feel and  experience of working with a range similar in complexity to an slr.Trade off would be the much greater pixel strength of the big guns but try this camera and you might just be surprised.Add to this the 10.7 x zoom and the reach of the digital zoom which is only available in 3.2  pixel strenth plus the 55mm direct access for accesorie lenes and you have a dust free real pro-sumer wonder.My Olympus wide angle which is 55 threaded works beautifully on this baby and I am looking forward to using the telephoto attachments as wellTHIS IS THE BEST BUY IN THE DIGITAL CAMERA MARKET FOR A SERIOUS AMATEUR OR A RESTLESS PRO LIKE MYSELF!!!!!!", "Date": "February 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC ENTRY CAMERA", "Author": "A.

The s5200 is about the same but has a few more megapixels--helpful if you want to print out larger photos. This is an excellent entry level camera and is just as good to have and hold as your forever digital camera. The design is so friendly and it's quick to grab and pop off some good shots. It's lightweight so wearing it around your neck won't feel like a burden. You might find you'll need a tripod or monopod for those long-range zoom shots however. Even a small amount of \"the diet coke shakes\" can really make photos come out fuzzy. There are some nice inexpensive monopods around which also have a pan head for range of motion. I take these hiking which adds to my self-defense system too. (I could really knock somebody over with that pan head!!) You might also like to purchase a neoprene soft case for your camera. I bought one on eBay for about $20. I carry my camera all over in my purse and having such a case is almost a necessity. I'd also like to recommend the new 1gb XD card. The s5200 can take a film clip. The higher amount of memory is helpful if you'd like to take a few film clips then also shoot a number of photos before clearing the memory card. The camera uses 4 AA type batteries and really sucks up the energy quickly. I went through these rapidly before discovering lithium batteries. These run about $10 for 4 which sounds expensive. However, lithium lasts about 15 times longer than even Energizers do. Lithium batteries are also MUCH lighter weight which is nice when you're wearing the camera around your neck!!I've gotten so many wonderful photos with my s5000 and some are sale and exhibition quality. There are manual options on this camera and you can also buy lenses that are add-on's to the fixed lens. If you want to learn more about digital photography, then this camera is perfect for you even if you don't ever intend to go any further with it. You will be pleased with your results and that's an important part of the learning process. Hope the tips I've provided are helpful and encouraging.

I attend women in childbirth and take a lot of pictures of babies coming into the world in very low light conditions (candlelight or one lamp). Any other camera I would have to use a flash or settle for hardly being able to see, but this camera really duplicates the light conditions. If I can see, the camera can see. This has resulted in some phenomenal birth photos, and newborn photos, since all the pictures of new babies aren't just babies cringing to the harsh light of the flash. I can capture the softness and beauty of the moment.Another really important thing for me is that there is virtually no lag time between pushing the button and the camera taking a picture. That means I get a picture of the exact moment that I want. This is essential when photographing an event like birth or taking pictures of kids, animals, ect. I have had this camera several months now and the only thing negative that I can say about it is that if light conditions are very low and you are using the natural light setting you have to hold the camera very still if you don't want the image to blur. I have learned to do this so it isn't a problem, but most other people who haven't used my camera before have a hard time taking pictures in low light. That's okay though because they can always turn on the flash and still get a terrific picture! (You would have to hold really still taking a picture with ANY camera in low light.)The zoom is another great feature of this camera. I wouldn't want a camera with any less zoom after using this. It makes it so much easier to take well composed candid shots (especially when using the natural light setting- people never realize you are taking pictures of them!)I recommend this camera to anyone who wants quality pictures!

If it had Image Stavilization (IS), 12x zoom and a bigger screen, it would beat any camera on the market.PROS AND CONS.I made my own extensive research on this camera, i even posted it in some forums, if you search for this words \"All about Fujifilm Finepix S5200\" you will find it. From all the reviews i had read I recompiled this PROS and CONS from this camera:PROS:-Very fast shutter (true) and startup (true). (Speed is obviously one of the best features of this camera)-It takes very Sharp pictures.-Great low light performance. (it definitely can see more than me in the dark)-Great control of noise on high ISO.-Fast Auto Focusing.-Capable of getting photos of fast moving subject without blur.-Long Zoom. (yes, too bad is not the longest, other cameras have 12x)-Real color, meaning low saturation (distortion) of color. (it's true, some will find this good, others not)-Good ergonomic, the camera feels great in your hands. (And it looks pretty good too)-Light weight. (other cameras in the super zoom category are quite heavy)-Very customizable settings (nice manual control, except for the manual focus)-Many photography modes to choose from.-Low batteries consumption (very true)-Doesn't use proprietary batteries but 4 AA.-Auto focus assist light.(A powerful one)-RAW Mode, for those who like post-processing.-Auto pop up flash. (Some people find this better to be manual)-Good Video recording with sound.-Excellent price-performance relation, a turning point for many buyers.-Well built, great quality construction. (for most of the people)CONS:-Grainy picture (because this camera likes selecting high ISO in auto setting)-Use XD picture card which is more expensive (Most of times true) and has slower transfer rate (haven't notice it)-No Image Stabilization. (Many people state it's not needed because the high ISO and speedy shutter, my idea is this combination is called Anti-Blur. Others claims I.S. is better than Anti Blur. I suppose the combination of both would be the best)-Difficult menu. (I don't think so)-RAW mode is hided in the set-up menu. (yes, it should be in the F button menu)-Too slow manual focus. (true, it's better to half press the shutter button and let the camera do the focusing)-Bulky. (as most of the super zoom cameras are, but I find it smaller than what it looks in the pictures)-Weak flash. (average)-Small LCD. (I would say average size)-No swivel LCD screen. (Definitely it is a useful option, I think the S9000 / S9500 have something like it, but it's pricy. The Canon's S2 and S3 are the only competitors having this option, but for higher cost and some limitations compared to the S5200)-Viewfinder don't have enough resolution (maybe the EFV doesn't have great resolution, but it has enough)-No flash hot shoe. (being able to use an add-on flash would had pleased some user not happy with the built-in flash)-Only 3 pictures in continuous shot. (It has a burst mode, all pictures you can take, but at a slower rate)-Not great software, specially the CCD-RAW conversion software.-Lag between shot when using the flash. (Like most cameras)-Made in china, for some reason Chinese are famous for having quality issues. Seems like because the globalization we will have to get used to it. Other Fujifilm cameras were made in Japan and showed great quality and durability; Hope this one does it too. (Should it be considered CONS?)-Battery compartment is a little difficult to close.

Run a search on that camera on Amazon and see the rating - I wish that Olympus would make that camera in a higher res. - but they don't so I was looking for a 10x zoom with higher res. - I wanted the lens always out - this makes it faster to turn on and be ready to shot - it is quieter and takes less battery not having to turn on and wait for a lens to extend. Also you can view the pictures using the view finder or the screen - I like looking at the pictures using the view finder, in bright light I see them clearly.It took a little while to get used to the settings and the locations of all the features but - after that - the moon is the limit - really I took the camera out last night with a full moon and digitally zoomed in on the moon and got a GREAT picture. It was sweet.... I will have to submit it for all to see.This is not a point and shot camera - you must take your time for the shot - but you can set the camera up for rapid shot and it will do almost as good as a point and shot camera. I set it up for rapid shot when catching action - and I will get some blurry so take enough shots :o) The best camera I have had for action rapid shots is my Olympus 3030 - that camera rocks and with having the SLR 2100 I have the best of both worlds... all but movie with no sound - and the low res. The Fujifilm S5200 5.1 will shot movie with sound and does a FINE job of that - you can not zoom while taking the movie shot - you must set up for that but - the quality is good. Sound is great - no camera noise - But reading a lot about cameras - no camera of this style will allow you to zoom in movie mode while shooting...Bottom line:I like this camera and glad I bought it - I have shots in time that will never again be seen without a camera - my young grandchildren shot in video with sound - and still shots that are GREAT - If you are not willing to spend over 500 or 1,000 dollars for a camera - I would recommend this camera. In fact I am going to buy one for my daughter for her birthday - that is how much I like this camera. But then I am not willing to spend the big bucks for a new camera.

Ericksen", "ReviewID": "RBLAIB8YVRC0Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love all the features of this camera--the zoom, all the various photo settings, the ability to change ISO settings.  The CCD is outstanding (**at the lowest ISO setting**), and color preservation is pretty good.  One of the things I really like about this camera is the speed at which you can take repeated pictures.  For a person who has only had point-and-shoot cameras up until now this has been a nice step up and a learning experience.  If you are in the same position I was expect a little bit of a learning curve.  But you should expect that with any camera you buy that is more than a point-and-shoot--this camera is no harder than the next.  I've had the camera for a few months now, so I'm starting to feel pretty comfortable with it's capabilities.The video capabilies of the camera are nice, but nothing to write home about--it won't replace your video camera.  The camera also has some annoying blurring problems with lower ISO settings--so make sure you have a steady hand, or use a tripod.  My one big complaint is that graininess is a huge problem at higher ISO's.  It starts from the moment you move from 64 (the lowest setting) to 100.  Take test pictures of the same object at different ISO settings, throw them into photoshop, and then zoom in about 5 levels or so.  Image quality is outstanding on the ISO 64 pictures, but you get noticeable image degradation by moving up just one ISO setting.  The result is that by the time you get to ISO 800 or even 400 the image has significant graininess.  So noticeable that even 4x6 prints of the pictures look pretty bad (like they were printed on an older color ink jet printer).  In my option a 5 MP camera should not have 4x6 prints coming out that bad.  It's really a shame too because at lower ISO blurring is a problem--too bad there is no image stabilization (luckily I have a surgeons hands--literally).Overall, the camera is a nice, affordable step up for those who have been point-and-shoot people and want to get a little more serious.  It is not, however, without some moderate flaws, which is why I give it only 4 stars.", "Date": "March 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the money", "Author": "Martin L.

(I can use it without my glasses, which is good because using it with my glasses let's in stray light, making it harder to see in daylight).- Fuji `Super CCD' has at least a full stop better noise performance and better dynamic range and color than most other inexpensive 10:1 and 12:1 super-zooms (shoot at ISO 400 with ISO 200 or 100 quality).- RAW mode capture can really take advantage of the wide dynamic range of the CCD (at clearance prices, the s5200 is a fairly inexpensive way to get this feature, normally only available on more expensive models).- Good Lens (sharp and not too much purple fringing).- Better Quality at 5MP than many 6MP and 7MP cameras.- 55mm filters screw right on (no adaptor needed like many point and shoot cameras)- If you want a nice 26.6mm equivalent wide angle (instead of the default 38-380), the awesome Kodak \"SCHNEIDER-KREUZNACH XENAR 0.7X Wide-Angle Lens, 55 mm\" sold here on Amazon will screw right on like it was made for this camera (no adaptor of any sort needed). This lens is a bit pricey, but is MUCH better than those cheapy add-on wide angle lenses, and under most conditions gives quality very close to the original lens but wider. (It's about a $110 bucks, but I saved enough on the clearance price of the camera to more than pay for it).  Note that the schneider addon lens has the same issues with partially blocking the POP up flash as were mentioned in it's Amazon review, but works great for really wide angle 'natural light' shots due to the s5200's higher ISO capability.CON's- Larger than other 10:1 cameras that have lens that telescopes into body (big plus however is no worries about messing up lens mechanism).- Really dumb user interface (things you need like FORMAT and RAW buried on sub-sub menus)- RAW mode is a little slow and eats up expensive XD memory card space(4 or 5 seconds per shot and 90 pictures or so per 1GB card) but this is on a par with most other point and shoot models.- Very Small main LCD display by current standards and the alternate EVF can be a bit hard to see in daylight (even though it's still much better then the main LCD).- Supplied RAW converter software is just about useless (but several FREEWARE programs support the camera including s7raw and the famous high quality DCraw command line program).- XD memoryWhat's the bottom line?  Given all the considerable plusses and seemingly minor minuses would I buy the same camera again?SORRY, NOT ON YOUR LIFE!Why? (Probably sounds pretty good right?)I highly recommend you take a pass on the s5200 (and ANY other camera that uses XD), unless you are a big Fuji or Olympus fan and are already stuck with XD memory.The XD memory card comes very close to that old computer programming magazine April 1 issue announcement of the invention of the \"Write-Only Memory\" (a funny April fools joke, but NOT so funny in real life).I have had a half dozen digital cameras with both CF and SD memory cards, and have NEVER lost even a single image, or had a card fail in more than 4 years, but in only about a month of shooting with `XD' I have had images get corrupted or lost a half dozen times and have already had an XD card totally fried when I committed the apparently unpardonable sin of plugging it into a supposedly fully `XD compatible' card reader (That works PERFECTLY by the way with both CF cards and SD cards).Apparently one reason that external card readers work so poorly with XD is that Fuji and Olympus never released the design info, and then to make matters worse, they made incompatible changes like `type M' and `type H' cards (These cards won't even work right in some Fuji and Olympus cameras, so how are the poor card reader folks supposed to figure things out?) I guess the type H cards were to try to be as fast as SD (they're NOT), and type M was just to try to save a few bucks (for THEM you silly ninny NOT for YOU, because XD cards sell for 2 to 4 times what equivalent SD cards sell for).Don't `hot-plug' the memory (which is fine with SD and CF) or you'll loose your pictures (and if you hit the jackpot destroy the XD card completely).Don't try to download with an external card reader, unless you know it works with EXACTALLY that type and size XD card (shouldn't cost more than a couple $40 dollar cards to find out if your reader works if your lucky).Don't even try to download from the camera without that AC adaptor (that they didn't bother to supply) or very freshly charged batteries, because downloading big RAW files over the SLOW USB port takes FOREVER, and if the batteries die, so will the card and your pictures most likely.So, despite my favorable impression of the s5200's image quality, and general willingness to overlook it's other slight imperfection, if I had it to do over again I would NOT buy this camera again knowing now what a joy it is working (or more often NOT WORKING) with XD memory cards.To put things in perspective, if someone told me tomorrow that there was a new Fuji or Olympus camera with an incredible 40:1 F1.4 zoom with flawless optical performance, with a new Zuper-Duper CCD that could shoot at ISO 6000 with NO NOISE, and that it only cost 100 dollars (but that this miracle camera could ONLY use XD memory), then I just might be slightly tempted, but probably would PASS on it.Remember Jack Nicholson's great line in `Terms of Endearment' -  \"I'd rather stick needles in my eyes!\"That's how much I despise XD memory, now that I have had to deal with it.On the other hand, if you are already used to dealing with XD from another Fuji or Olympus product (you're a better man than I am Charley Brown), then I DO recommend the s5200 if you can find one on clearance, because aside from the hated XD memory issues, it performs quite well and can take some really awesome images (especially in RAW mode).", "Date": "May 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Gary S.

There is a \"high speed\" shutter setting that makes it somewhat like SLR with good light.  I've used it wakeboarding, fishing, skiing, mountain biking, etc etc... its been everywhere with me.  Like I said 11K pics so far, I consider it disposable and will buy an replacement when I drop it in the drink(lake) what have you.At my wedding outside of Las Vegas, up on a Mountain at sunset.  We had 5 people there - My Bride, Me, Limo driver, Minister, Professional Photographer.  She(pro) had 3 SLRs with all kind of lens.  I handed my S5200 to the limo driver and said \"just put it on auto and take whatever\".  We ended with 200 Professional pictures and 75 S5200 taken by limo driver.  The 3 best were from the S5200.  That may be luck, maybe he(limo) was at better angle than her(pro).. But to even compete with a pro is outstanding.We wakeboard and take it every time.  Hand it to anyone and you'll end up with some great pics.  Of course with any digital camera you take way too many, because its free.  It will support a 2gb xd mini only (I think).  I have the original 1gb xd.  You can take 1K pics or so on 1gb.  Video eats up the space.  To the video:This camera takes excellent video.  You get 7-15 minutes with 1gb.  So- if you want to use it for this buy extra xds.  Great Video!!It's tough.  I babied it for a year, got a little looser a 2 years later, then it went wherever.  Now I'm and 11,000 pictures taken.

I'm so proud I bought this well engineered product!", "Author": "DJ Ryan \"Ryan\"", "ReviewID": "RBIWMODXURD1R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've got so many good things to say about this Camera, I really don't know where to start.I bought this camera 3 years ago. I hadn't really had any experience with any Fuji cameras before. I had played around with my friends' cameras before I bought this camera; they had Non-SLR Hi-Zoom cameras that were made for medium duty photography. Many of these cameras were Canons or Nikons with lots of zoom and nice features. So eventually I decided to buy a camera in this same class, just I didn't know which one. So rather than searching for a digital camera based solely on the popularity of the name, I decided to take a shot at this product based on the Specs and Features that it had. At the time this camera had more features, options, and abilities than other cameras in its class. So I decided to buy this Fujifilm S5200 right here on Amazon.3 years later... NO REGRETS. Ever since the first week I received this camera, I fell in love with it and all of the options it had in it. When I want a camera that I can just take some quick everyday pictures, it's GREAT. When I want a camera that I can take some technical, high-quality images, it's AWESOME! The S5200 can be simple and fun for you, BUT also complex and technical if you want it to be so. It is an EXREMELY versatile camera.It has TONS of Optical Zoom, as well as the Digital Zoom on top of that. I must say, if you choose to use the Digital Zoom (and zoom in even furthermore) you will NOT be disappointed. The Digital Zoom processor in these Fujifilm cameras is Excellent in my opinion. I have digitally zoomed into many objects and taken pictures of them that are still very clear and impressive. The S5200 has Digital Zoom with noticeably LESS graininess than its competitors. And of course its Fujinon 10X Optical Zoom lens has beautiful flawless clarity. NO SHORTCOMINGS with the S5200's zoom system.Many options to play with Exposure, ISO, shutter speeds, many flash options, etc. You can also choose to do sound recordings and video recordings! Single Shot, Multiple Shot, and Continuous Shot picture taking modes. The S5200 uses 4x AA batteries, alkaline OR rechargeable Nickel-Metal Hydride. And I can tell you from experience, that the power consumption of this camera is FAR more efficient than its Nikon and Canon competitors. I have gone through days where I took hundreds of pictures (some with flash, some without) and I still had a little battery power left.There are various Automatic Focus modes, as well as Manual Focus whenever you so desire. NOTE: Don't get confused with the Big Fat lens on this camera! The Manual Focus is adjusted electronically with 2 buttons, NOT ON A FOCUS RING (as there is none). Adjusting the Manual Focus with the 2 Buttons works just fine in my opinion.The camera is very sturdy and durable, though of course be gentle with it as you would with all electronics. Nothing loose or flimsy and cheap. Over my 3 years owning and using this, nothing has gone wrong. Nothing broken, nothing loose, nothing cracked. You can buy a nice black leather case made by Fujifilm specially to encase the Fuji S series cameras. Fuji also makes a Wide-Angle Lens adapter for the S5200, if you want to do wide shots of landscapes and such.The final thing I must comment on about this whole experience is VERY important. The camera Drivers and Fujifilm FinePix Software have both performed EXCELLENT. The drivers work great and they never glitched up or caused any problems with my PC. The computer reads the S5200 instantly and boom you're good to go. You can transfer the pictures via Windows reading the S5200 as removable storage OR you can have the awesome, straight-forward FinePix software move them over for you.At first I was somewhat skeptical about the FinePix software. But I ended up playing with the software eventually, messing around with its features and such. I end up finding out that it's actually a very GOOD and USEFULL piece of software. It's got options that let you manage the interfacing of the camera to your computer. The FinePix software also has a great set of features for adjusting and tweaking your photos to perfection. You can view all the technical details of a photo and adjust many qualities of photos easily and quickly right there in the software. What I like most about the FinePix software is the set of tools which greatly help me organize my photos. Rotation, File Numbering, Resolution Adjustments, etc. are as easy as 1-2-3 for just 1 file or multiple files. A surprisingly good piece of software from Fujifilm!5/5 STARS, no doubt in my mind!Thank you Fujifilm for this great product!Thank you Amazon for a great price!", "Date": "November 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fuiji Finepix S5200- Great Camera even for beginners", "Author": "Darlene C.

The Sony had a 10X zoom capability, a few special effects (which I almost never used), and a flash that could be manually activated.  Contrasted with it, the features of this Fugifilm Finepix constitute a whole new universe for me, yet, with a bit of practice, the learning curve is not at all intimidating.  Set to \"Automatic,\" the camera requires no learning curve whatsoever.  For common, everyday photography, just point and shoot!So far as picture quality is concerned, most of my amateurish shots have turned out far better than my skill as a photographer warrants.  The sole exception to this was a series of distant panoramas I took from a mountain peak at about 6,000 feet above sea level.  The landforms and forests were captured in great color, but the sky was uniformly washed out, more gray than blue, possibly an effect of the UV light at that altitude?  Perhaps I should have used a UV filter.My only other criticism of the camera is that it must be connected to a computer with a supplied USB cable, and all the previously un-downloaded shots will download into whatever directory the user has specified via the software that comes with the camera.  I would prefer to be able to view the shots in Photoshop on the PC and select those to be saved rather than saving everything and then going back to delete the ones I don't wish to keep.  Of course, poor shots can be deleted in the camera before downloading, but sometimes I'd prefer to examine them on the larger computer monitor.  I also just plain dislike having to install additional software on my PC in addition to Photoshop.The old Sony I had was perfect in that it recorded all the images onto a 3.5 inch floppy disk inside the camera.  Inserting that disk into the PC drive enabled me to open each shot directly into Photoshop with no need for any additional software. Admittedly, I had to carry several floppies along with the camera since each one holds only a tiny fraction of what a memory card will accommodate.  It's a trade-off, of course.Since every contemporary digital camera seems to require specialized associated software these days, I suppose it's something one must accept in order to use the new camera technology.

Forget trying to focus in AUTO mode, it won't happen.. at least not without alot of tinkering and stress.If you need to take alot of close up pictures of small detailed items (jewelery, insects, etc.) then I recommend buying a digital SLR camera, Nikon D50 is a good one!

Most cameras have at least 8mp if not more and even the crap tastic el cheapo cameras have more mega pixlels than this thing.I have since upgraded to a Nikon d3100 and have retired this camera.
