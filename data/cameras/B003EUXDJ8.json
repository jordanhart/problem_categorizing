I LOVE the \"children\" setting- you can take STUNNING pictures regardless of whether or not your little wiggle worm is wiggling. Fantastic. :) It has all the \"pro\" settings- and it's EASY to use. You will look like a professional photog with this camera- you can adjust lighting, flash, you can even adjust/edit after you've snapped the picture. This is my second purchase of this camera. My first one got broken (my fault) at my daughter's birthday party. I replaced it with another brand of camera and HATED it. Yes, it had many of the same features but the pictures never came out anywhere NEAR as good. I know this is an \"old\" camera- but don't let that fool you. For as long as I can get my hands on one of these, this is my camera of choice.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Seriously worth it and I've been through alot of cameras", "Author": "jm", "ReviewID": "R3ICB2N0KMXCJR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I highly recommend this camera.
