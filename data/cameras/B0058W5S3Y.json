This one is performing admirably.This is the product I purchased, and am reviewing:[...]The photo on the Swann product page is the same as the one here on the Amazon product, so I can't rule out that this product is different than mine. As compared to the one pictured here at Amazon, the product I've got has a matte finish handle, and the bottom of the base is slightly different (includes soft rubber accordion bend support) and the handle's taper has the only controls (button & dial), and the taper has the logo and a big serial number sticker.This is the Swann (manufacturer) product page:[...]The product's pictures & video are as good as an average 640x480 webcam. I pointed it at myself, and the quality could easily be used as a web cam. It needs just over an inch to provide clear focus, so I didn't get a clear closeup of the inside of my ear canal. Looking down my home's duct work, I could see & navigate the initial bends, but then could only see as far as the little lights would shine down the straight-away, where I saw only darkness. Also, I couldn't verify Swann's night-vision claim.I needed to install the driver, and the computer now recognizes it as a webcam. The software that comes up when I click the button on the handle, allows a live preview, and video recording (with some filter-type and timed duration adjustments). I recorded a Test.mov file which VLC reported as:VLC (v1.1.11)->Tools->Media InformationStream 0Type: VideoCodec: 24 bits RGB (RV24)Resolution: 640x480Display resolution: 640x480Frame rate: 14.990009The video definitely looked like it was 640x480, and not chunky as 160x120. When I moved the camera around, the room smeared with motion either because this room isn't very bright, or the camera isn't super fast. When I went slow, or stopped, the picture snapped into much better clarity. The two white lights on the end worked fine. The brightness was controlled by the dial on the handle.The drawbacks I saw were that it is hard to maneuver (like all inspection cameras), and that I needed to pay attention that the grip's orientation conveyed the \"up\" orientation of the camera (which helps to know when maneuvering). Other than that, being tethered to a computer isn't convenient, but a laptop and using a USB extension seems to mostly solve that issue. The final issue is that inspection cameras are coming with heads as small as 9mm in the general consumer market, and this one is 12mm, and the head is longish, making it possibly difficult to insert or bend through tight places.I have to \"love it\" for the fifty that I paid for it. If I wanted more I'd have to spend the 3-6 times more on a different product (trying to get something un-tethered and better). It lived up to my expectations and its advertised specifications.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for the price, but..", "Author": "H. Mehta", "ReviewID": "R1ZLFWPFVTZEL9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this just to try it out since the price is low.  It preforms well enough.  If you are buying this for automotive use be aware that the camera tip is too large to fit into the spark plug holes, so if your looking for something to peek inside cylinders then this camera wont help you. Obviously the smaller cameras are more manueverable and better for tight spaces but the price goes up significantly. Just depends on what your use for it is.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not as advertised", "Author": "Ron", "ReviewID": "RCQYML6F7O6S6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I needed an inspection camera and decided to give this one a try. This camera is sold in many online stores over the web for even less money but I bought this one believing that this camera is made by Swann and the other cameras that look exactly like this one are counterfeiter products. When I received the camera I understood that I was wrong. This camera is made by a generic Chinese manufacturer without a name. Swann apply a label with their name and sell it as a brand item.The camera description says that its video resolution is 640 X 480. This is not true. You start doubt that when you connect the camera to the computer and try to use it. The video is so fuzzy it is hard to guess what you see through the camera. I pushed the camera into a carton box that I didn't know what was in it but wasn't able to tell what was there.Going back to the camera resolution. It is not 640 X 480 as advertised but 160 x 120. You can tell that by opening the camera stream in VLC player and checking the Media Info. It will tell you the actual video resolution. I notified the seller about that but they just referred me to the manufacturer.I returned this camera.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0058W5S3Y"}}
