Anyway called Vonnic and a actual person answered on the second ring. Told me to send it in and it would be repaired or replaced. Three days later got a brand new later model replacement at my door. I am impressed! They answer the phone, they stand behind their products, are prompt and treat customers great. My hat off to the folks at VONNIC!", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.00", "Features": "High Quality Real time Display with H.264 Compression Technology\n24/7 Remote View View internet and Mobile phone Live view support\nSupports Alarm and Motion detection\nTrue Color Day time image and infrared LED for night vision", "Name": "Vonnic DK4264B All-In-One Kit Solution with 4 Camera, 4 Channel, 500 GB DVR, H.264 Remote Web/3G Mobile Phone Access (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JVGwnY2ZL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003TOZF8G"}}
