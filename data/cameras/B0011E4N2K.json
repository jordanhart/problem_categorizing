{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good but not Great", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R3A0A85R2D8H9W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Updated on December 16, 2008I upgraded to the Stylus 1010 from the Stylus 830.  Though it is arguable whether it is a true upgrade.Besides the obvious improvements such as the better zoom, higher MP's, and a beefed up lens it is essentially the same camera.  It does have a better battery (up to 70 more shots per charge), simpler controls, and improved software on the camera, but it is not weatherproof, which used to be a standard feature on Stylus models.  Olympus deruggedized the 1010 by taking out the rubber gaskets on the access doors and by replacing the anodized aluminum body that the 830 has with a plastic one.The one major improvement the 1010 has is its ability to accept SD micro cards (with an adapter) which have a considerably larger maximum capacity (up to 16 GB), and are much cheaper than their larger alternative the XD whose capacity is limited to 2GB's (a quick price check on amazon shows that a 4GB Micro SD costs around $6, and a standard 2GB XD card cost around $20.)The SHQ movie feature seems to be a reoccurring problem with Olympus though.  The Stylus 830 was only able to record 20 second clips at VGA 640x480/30fps.  The Stylus 1010 can only record 10 second clips at that setting.  However the 1010 does give you the option of recording VGA 640x480/15fps with longer clips.*A new development on this is a fix from Olympus.  First of all you have to have a camera that currently has the 1.1 version firmware.  If you don't, you'll have to go to their website to update it.  Be aware though, that website carries the following warning.\"Please note that if the firmware upgrade is not performed properly your camera will need to be serviced to have the camera returned to an operational state.\"Once you have the 1.1 you will be able to record movies with 4gb and higher SD Micro cards as well as record movies with VGA quality 640 x 480/30 fps up to the full capacity of the card (no longer limited to 10 second)  But this is only with  XD Type M+ cardsor the XD Type H cards. This seems to be a complicated and expensive fix considering the price of buying high speed cards (a 2GB XD Type M+ cost around $30), but it is a fix none the less *Overall I am happy with the purchase and am impressed with the picture quality, and the expanded options in the software.  However Olympus could have spent a little extra time developing a true upgrade for the stylus series instead of throwing in a few improvements, (and retrogrades in my opinion) and calling it two different cameras (the 1010 and 1020 whose only difference is the LCD screen, and flash option on during high speed sequential shooting.)", "Date": "April 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "More MP is not always better", "Author": "Heidi", "ReviewID": "R1HSWF9IZ9WIF7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have used Olympus cameras for about 15 years and have always been happy with them. Unfortunately, I have used this camera for six months and am getting a new one. There are several good things about this camera, but there is one huge flaw: poor image quality. I have been doing some research and discovered that the megapixels are the culprit. While the camera has 10MP, the image sensor was not made to accommodate 10MP's worth of detail. Because the image sensor is small, it produces grainy photos. You will get better quality images with a camera that has fewer megapixels and/or a larger image sensor.Some things I DO like about this camera: 1. Good close-up/macro shots; 2. \"Scene\" settings, such as \"Available Light;\" 3. Image name includes the date the picture was taken; 4. Portability/size of camera; 5. You can take panoramic photos (if using xD card); 6. Built-in lens cap; 7. Large LCD screen.Some things I DO NOT like about this camera: 1. Grainy pictures, especially indoors; 2. Flash is too bright and frequently washes out my subject; 3. Lens is easily smudged and can be tricky to clean because it is so small; 4. Can't make the image be 4x6 ratio, so I have to manually crop all of my photos before printing them.", "Date": "November 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera!", "Author": "D.

The 4GB works perfectly in the camera and allows for 1600+ pictures on 10 MP Normal quality.  I ran my own test between fine and normal qualities, but did not find enough of a discernable difference to warrant the doubling of the file size.I plan on taking the camera with me on a 2 week cruise in Europe.  I wanted a camera with a great zoom, quality, and the ability to store all of my pictures on a single memory card.  I feel I have found the perfect travel companion in this camera for size, quality, and weatherproofed travel conditions.Overall I think this is a great camera and while I can't use the panorama mode on the camera, I can easily get some \"stitching\" software to create my own.  I would recommend this camera to those that want a portable large zoom camera with a plethora of features for the basic to intermediate photographer.", "Date": "April 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "I do like this camera!", "Author": "Charles W. Long", "ReviewID": "R3N8NKPC85KT2T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I am not a great expert.  But I do like to take good pictures, and do have a special need for close-up photos, and both of these needs are accomplished by this camera in a way that exceeds my rather high hopes and expectations.My special 'close-up' application doesn't seem to be covered by other reviewers, and my experience using the Olympus 1010 in this way may be of interest to someone with similar needs. I do scrimshaw wherein images are produced on ivory-like surfaces by an engraving technique known as stippling (creating tones with closely spaced dots). I like to photograph my work in a way that reveals the technique, and shows how images with fine detail are created. In most cases it is necessary to photograph the subject at a distance of about 3 to 4 inches. I could go into much detail about how I struggled to get results approximating what I wanted using other cameras, but with the Olympus 1010 all I need to do is put the subject in reasonably good light and shoot the picture with the camera hand-held in the regular macro mode. The results are so good that I have already consigned my tripods and special lighting platform to the storage shed where they will reside until my next yard sale.For ordinary day-to-day pnotographing I have entertained myself by shooting pictures of various subjects with various lighting conditions, and have been uniformly impressed with the results of my clearly amateurish efforts. There doesn't need to be a book entitled \"Photography For Dummies\" written for users of this camera. I have proof that it can make one with little photographic talent look very good.", "Date": "May 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "Douglas Haskin", "ReviewID": "RS6ZJBUKQEE9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using Olympus cameras since the OM-1 SLR many years ago, so I am probably a little biased.I purchased The Olympus Stylus 1010 along with the 2 gig XD card a month ago and have found it to be everything advertized. It is extremely easy to use as a point and show camera though the many possibilities for additional settings may be a little intimidating for a beginner. I had been happy with my previous Stylus except for extreme closeups and telephoto. With the Stylus 1010 the 7X optical zoom takes care of most of my telephoto needs and for closeups using the macro or supermacro settings work just great.Probably the biggest surprise for me was the Panorama feature. This provides the option of guiding you through the necessary steps for three parallel shots and then \"stitching\" them together right in the camera. This is the feature I show people when I say, \"Hey! Look what my new camera will do!\"", "Date": "May 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Movie camera", "Author": "Tom Hartman", "ReviewID": "R2ABMO5TQB52PF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for the 7x optical zoom and the image stabilization. I was disappointed when I read other reviews talking about a 10 sec video limit but I need a small point and shoot camera not a video camera so it didn't matter as much to me.  I popped in a 2GB xD card and just to test out everything shot some video to see how it worked.  The camera started to count down from 29 min.  I put it in a tripod duck taped the whole thing to my motorcycle and drove it around my neighborhood it was a short trip but it recorded 6 minutes of really clear video and I was still counting down so I'm sure I could have recorded another 23 more minutes.  It corrected for lighting the sound was good and the picture was excellent.", "Date": "July 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "A great camera - with a caveat", "Author": "Moonchilde", "ReviewID": "R290TKSNZVUWDF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm surprised and delighted with the sharp, clear photos this camera takes, the panorama feature, and the amount of editing that can be done in-camera - it's amazing.  The instructions and the camera's menus are quite friendly if you've ever used a digital camera before.  I'm already using settings that I never could remember how to find in my much less intuitive Sony menu.However, in using all those settings, I discovered that when Olympus and the 1010's users tout the camera's long battery life, they're talking about point and shoot with the occasional flash or zoom, and not taking full advantage of all the special features the camera has to offer.  If, for example, you use the zoom frequently, set your screen brightness to high because you're shooting in bright sunlight, use the Guide frequently, make a lot of in-camera edits, play back to erase old photos you've fixed in camera, etc., a new, fully charged battery drains fast, and without adequate warning.  The battery drain I might have expected, and that's not the real issue for me as I can live with that considering all the great things the camera can do.  The biggest problem for me so far is that after shooting approximately 40-50 photos one day, doing all of the above (zoom, lots of edits, playing back, etc.) the battery indicator still showed green and full.  The following day, after I had taken maybe 5 shots, the battery suddenly (i.e. no quarter or half `down' indications) blinked red and showed a quarter charge left.  At no time when I turned the camera on did the battery indicator show anything but green and a full charge.  After anywhere from one shot taken to 2-3 seconds after turn-on, the indicator showed almost empty, and eventually empty battery.  I had made a trip to a local museum specifically to try the camera out, and left after taking less than half the shots I wanted to try because the battery, which had read fully charged the night before, was completely dead within maybe 18 shots.  Again - it's not the battery drain itself that shocked me (I was doing a lot of experimenting), it was the fact that there was no indication that the battery capacity was being used up, so I could be aware and re-charge before another outing.  After the battery was fully recharged, I did perhaps 5 min or less of editing and deleting on the camera, and when I plugged the camera back into the charger it took another 15-20 mins. to recharge to capacity!  So, don't trust the battery charge indicator, especially if you're taking shots at an event important to you.  An extra battery for this camera isn't just desirable, it's absolutely mandatory to carry with you if you intend to edit in-camera.  If you don't have a spare ready to pop in, you really can't make full use of all of the camera's features, or even most of them, on a consistent basis.  If you're a total point-and-shoot-on-auto user I guess it isn't an issue, but I'm a 'serious for fun' user and I bought the camera for an upgrade specifically to use all its many features.That said, it's a very cool little camera.  I do love the `little' - fits so easily into a purse for take-along all the time.  It's also very light, even with the battery.  In the promo description of this camera, Olympus said that they wanted their color not just to be vivid and bright, but to be `pleasing to the eye', and it's definitely that - much more pleasing and accurate colors than my Sony.  And what's not to like about the zoom?!  Fantastic.  The Shadow Adjustment Technology is brilliant - my favorite feature, really.  It works like a charm.  The macro function works beautifully.  I'm a little confused as to what some of the Scene modes are actually supposed to do.  Shots I took in the museum with the `behind glass' feature actually came out looking worse than without it.  Some of the Available Light shots I took look better than my Sony, some look the same, and some not as good (I was doing retakes of pix I already had from the other camera, under the same lighting conditions, to compare).  The panorama feature is very cool.  As far as the brightness of the screen in bright sunlight - I'd say better than my 2 year old Sony, and viewable in bright sunlight, but just that - viewable, not extra special.  In average sunlight it's definitely better than the Sony.  The video is fine, too - probably as good as the Sony's, and they are known for their video capabilities.  The quick charge works well.In summary, I love the camera and would happily recommend it to others, with a caveat that using all of the features that most people will be buying it for will use up the battery very quickly, so you really do need an extra battery at the least.Update:  Two more weeks of camera use, and I'm a very happy camper.  Absolutely love the panorama (but can someone tell me where to get them printed?) feature, the shadow adjustment, best shot and the macro.  One very nice surprise - I always use Photoshop Express to 'quick fix' my photos before printing or uploading to share, and there is almost no difference between my Before and After results!  With my Sony, there is a pretty significant difference.  How cool is that, when it's almost impossible to improve on the snapped photo?!", "Date": "September 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "One star less for the connection cable!", "Author": "Karen F", "ReviewID": "RUN4MKRZ458CR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this for about a month but used it on a vacation so it got lots of use.  Lovvvve the color but beyond that it takes great pics.  I am replacing a Canon-S2IS with a 12x zoom (zoom is a major consideration for me in getting a camera).  I was tired of the bulkiness of it and looking for something smaller but with camparable zoom and pic quality.It was between a small camera with a 10x zoom and this camera that caught my eye, I confess, with the color!  The other had higher zoom, larger viewer (another concern for me)but was a bit bigger. the Olympus was smaller but less zoom.  I decided to buy the other when I took one last look through the viewers of both and realized I could see much clearer through the Olympus!  Even without my cheater glasses - even though the screen was smaller! That sold me! I don't miss the difference in the zoom, it takes great pics, flash is great and I haven't begun to try all the easily accessible options for special shots, no flash, etc.  Battery charge lasts a long time.  I got the XDm+ memory card for it so I could take longer videos. Price was $30 for 2 gig, not terrible. The size is great - I carry it everywhere now and get more chances to have some great shots!The one drawback that I stated in the title is the USB connection. I cannot believe that they made it so slightly different that you cannot use a standard PC to camera cable - you need the one they supply.

After days of online research I almost purchased a Canon Powershot. Then I came upon the Stylus 1010. What had me was the 7x optical zoom. But what almost turned me away were reports of 10 seconds cont. video recording time at 640x480 30fps. After further research I purchased the 1010 along with a 2Gb M+ card. Happily when I droped the card in and started recording video at high res. it started counting down from 18 minutes. When I played back the video on my tv the picture and audio quality was great. I did not need to do a firmware upgrade as some said. Once I got to using the friendly controls and the zoom I was awed. People are amazed when I show them pictures of objects with and without zoom. Very impressive for a compact camera.People complain about the panorama mode but there are two in-camera and one pc mode which are very easy to use. Must admit at first I was a bit disappointed with the overall photo quality but that was before I knew how to use features like autofocus and metering. If not sure what settings to use just select 'auto'. Another thing I like is that if you are not sure what a function is for the 'disp' button gives a written explanation.

Corson", "ReviewID": "R33ZCSDFHXELPO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "For a long time I looked forward to owning a Stylus 1010.  I'm sorry to say that I'm sadly disappointed.  There are so many good reviews that I thought it was a sure thing.  I wanted it mainly because it's small enough to fit in a purse and it's the only pocket camera I could find with a decent zoom (7x optical, equivalent to 37-260mm).  Unfortunately, every time I have the lens completely extended I get a blurry picture.I also get many grainy photos.  In all but the most ideal light situations the pictures are grainy or blurry.  Sometimes in full sunlight they are overexposed.  This is mainly with it on automatic settings.  I have played around with some of the multitude of other settings but have not been any more impressed.  Sometimes supermacro will give you a cool shot that is clear but just as often it will give you a blurry shot.  If your subject is moving at all with the macro settings then don't even waste time trying.  That is pretty much true with every other setting except sports.  And, I don't mean moving fast, I mean moving even slightly.This was supposed to be an easy point and shoot camera that my fiance could also use but it's obvious that he will not be able to count on getting a good shot with it.  Sometimes I think that my expectations were too high because I normally use a (semi) professional camera (Nikon D70S) but I do think a pocket camera should take at least 70% of the \"normal\" or \"easy\" pictures clearly.  I've owned a pocket size Canon camera before and got much better results.

Macro mode lets you focus on a subject down to four inches from the lens, and still allows use of telephoto; super-macro-mode lets you focus down to TWO CENTIMETERS (less than 1 inch) from the lens.  I do a lot of EBay and have need for detailed closeups of hallmarks and faded writing on antiques, and this feature is UN-BE-LIEVABLE.  Not only can you get 1 inch from your subject, but with 10 megapixels of resolution, you can go into Photoshop, crop a small section of the resulting picture, and blow it up to many times its size while still maintaining good clarity.  The result is that you can obtain clear pictures of details that are FREAKING MICROSCOPIC.  I kid thee not.  This feature alone is worth the very reasonable price.  You will find one or two reviews that comment on some kind of \"focusing problem\" when in macro mode.  To those people, I say:  RTFM!!!  When you hold the shutter part way down, the camera displays a focusing square, and it will be green when the camera successfully focuses.  It blinks red if the camera fails to achieve focus.  If that little guy is green, you will get a perfect picture every time. If it's red, just move a bit farther away from the subject and try again.  When you are operating that close, half an inch one way or the other makes a huge difference.  I will repeat:  THERE IS NO FOCUSING ISSUE IN MACRO MODE!!!!!OK, enough of that.  Other items:1) Some of the negative reviews say the picture quality is poor.  Those people must have been reviewing a different camera.  Or else they were competitors trying to badmouth the product.  Picture quality is superb.2) Many reviews comment that \"shadow mode\" is the key to taking good pix with this camera.  YES IT IS!  They goofed a teeny bit by not making it \"on\" by default.3) Yes, the 7x optical zoom is sweet.4) BATTERY:  One review commented that the \"battery remaining\" display is inaccurate.  I have to concur with that.  It tends to say 4 bars for a long time and then suddenly drop down to zilch.  However, in general the battery life is good and par for the course as such cameras go.  One review commented that if you use a lot of the optional features of the camera, the battery runs out quickly.  I'm sure she's right, but that is true of ANY camera.5) Personally I like to play around with settings when I shoot pictures and prefer cameras that are less \"point'n'click\" and more \"do-it-yourself\".  This camera has achieved a good balance between the two.  The automatic features of this camera result in good enough pictures that I really don't have much desire to play around (although I do recommend that you read the manual to learn more about how they work and become fluent with them).  They do allow you to perform a fair number of manual tweaks if you care to (but not aperature and shutter speed, the two most important ones!).6) Some reviews have commented that the flash is too strong.  I rarely use the flash and this thing takes great pictures without it 95% of the time (and it has several special modes to help you avoid using the flash). However, the one or two times I've tried, the results were less than stellar.  Yes, it seems on the strong side and seems to wash out the colors somewhat.  I'm convinced there's something I can set on this camera to improve this situation, but I haven't taken the time to figure that one out.Bottom line:  I LOVE THIS CAMERA!!!  And it doesn't even cost an arm and a leg.  The camera I truly thought I wanted was the Canon Powershot SX10, but I just couldn't bring myself to shell out the $400.  I decided to give this one a try and am very glad I did.", "Date": "August 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love it, small size, good picture quality", "Author": "R.

It did not fit in my pocket, only took expensive XD cards, and was slow.  However the picture quality was amazing and I constantly received compliments on my gorgeous photos.  It was effortless and I was so happy until one day the zoom lens froze halfway out.  I had taken nearly 10000 photos and had beaten this camera up so I decided to upgrade rather than have it serviced.The Olympus 1010 is not an upgrade!  The pics are nowhere near as nice as my old Olympus.  Way to cheap out on your product Olympus - what a complete disappointment.  I couldn't return it without a restocking fee so I just sucked it up and decided to do better research next time (Circuit City).  Ironically, this camera broke within one week - the zoom lens got stuck halfway out.  I had to pay to ship it to Olympus to have it repaired. It cost about $20 and I was furious.I've taken about 4000 photos and luckily it has not broken again but I am always worried.  I like the size of the camera, panoramic feature, image stabilizer, and the macro is nice.  It takes great outdoor shots and I like the options in the menu and scene guide (I do not find the menus intuitive however). I use a tiny pocket tripod and the timer function to take amazing macros and night shots.Indoor picture quality is severely lacking. Photos are always grainy or blurry.  It is just not an easy point and shoot camera. I have learned to only extend the zoom around halfway - 7X pics are garbage because of the poor quality.  They look fab in the LCD and then when I look at them full size I am disgusted by the blurriness.  The battery lasts for a full day of shooting (extend the life by using the built in power save feature which turns off the LCD between shots) but I don't know why they bother to give you an indicator.  The thing stays green and full until it goes to empty and red and then the camera dies after about 10 shots - wow, thanks for the head's up that I might want to charge my battery. You are not able to zoom during movie mode.If you do buy this camera, get an extra battery, a case, a mini-tripod, and be prepared to only enjoy your night, macro, and outdoor shots.

As an upgrade to older model Oylympus S350 and Canon S400 models, the S1010 represents a substantial improvement. The lens quality and focal length range is much more useful, pulling in far subjects with longer telephoto function and covering wider landscape and rooms with wide angle coverage. Flash output is higher, so there is much less light fall off when taking indoor shots. Both shadow and highlight range have improved with far greater detail.Long delays between shots are gone, continous shooting is 4x faster and transfer of files to a PC is similarly improved. The view finder is bright and viewable in sunlight, controls are handy. The steady shot function is very effective in controlling camera shake in low light. 4GB of storage and long battery life are convenient.Software features to me are gimicks that have little practical purpose and quickly lose their entertainment, need to fiddle, value. I can turn a camera on its end to change from landscape to portrait and I can pretty much tell when people are smiling. \"Gimick\" of course does not include improved exposure and contrast control with useful metering options that are included in the product.The camera will not deliver high end SLR results, as it does not have the optical range or image sensor coverage and density to do so.

In a word, I LOVE this camera!  Some of my favorite features:* It has a big LCD display, visible even in bright sunlight.  The one thing missing is a window you need to squint and look through, but to me this is nothing.  I prefer not having that window.* The high optical zoom of 7x is great for zooming and maintaining picture quality (fyi, digital zoom is useless - the optical zoom is what lets you zoom in without getting pixelatged pictures)* 10 megapixels mean you can enlarge to 8\"x10\" or more and your photos still maintain their quality without getting pixelated or faded.  This actually ended up saving us hundreds of dollars; we unfortunately had a home improvement contractor try to screw us over, but we were able to use our photos to prove against what he was trying to do (long story!) so this camera has already paid for itself!* There are presets you can use - select \"behind glass\" or \"extreme close up\" or any of a dozen other presets, and you can point and click instead of needing to know what f-setting or macro mode will yield the best photos.* The battery life has been great - I think I can take at least 200 photos, with flash, and with using the photo review, without needing to recharge.* The video quality is terrific, including picture and sound.  The sound review is a little quiet, but download it onto a computer and you can hear everything just fine.* The camera has software to download photos to your computer.

I wanted a simple no frills camera to take pictures.Pros:- Takes quick pictures. This camera does not take forever like some others do. This was a key feature for me as I have a newborn and its easy to miss out on key moments due to waiting for the picture during, and that nasty delay after you take a picture that prevents you from taking another.- The interface is very non-cumbersome. I am non-techie when it comes to cameras. This camera fits the point and shoot type of mentality. I also like the interface for the setting that asks you what type of picture you are taking so that it can adjust the flash (it asks portrait, water pictures, night pictures etc...)- The charger is very non-bulky. Lots of camera come with chargers that have long cables and just cause clutter. This one is a little box that plugs into your outlet and the battery goes inside the box. Nice, simple and clean. Battery life is quite reasonable.- Turns on and is ready to fire very quickly (at least versus other cameras I have used).Cons:- A little pricey for a simple camera, other simple cameras are less expensive. However, I was willing to pay more because this camera takes quick pictures and this was a critical feature for me.- I have noticed some noise on the pictures. I should point out that this could be user error as I am just using the default settings. The noise is very small and I really only notice it when using my huge 25.5 inch monitor (that has a decent color and resolution display). On my 22inch monitor (that is of lesser image quality) you cant really see the noise. I personally don't have a problem with the noise because I was willing to accept some picture noise for quick performance. I did want to mention this flaw as I realize there are people out there who maybe more anal then myself about the quality of the picture. If I had to put a number on it I would say the picture quality (on default setting) is 7/10. I also noticed that many of my pictures came out with Red Eye - but it was easy to fix with Vista's default picture viewer which can fix this with a couple of clicks (again not a issue for me personally but I did want mention it.So far I am very pleased and I would recommend it, esp if quick pictures is important to you (assuming you don't mind paying a little more).Side note: I noticed the camera came with some software to edit pictures, I have not installed the software so I cannot comment on that.", "Date": "September 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fastest Power-On to Shoot!", "Author": "A.

I took a lot of side by side shots and was even considering returning this new one! However this Olympus can do amazing things...the technology has come a long way. I do love the panoromic stitch mode, in camera editing, etc...however, I was VERY disapointed when I used the continuous shooting mode with the zoom.

I still don't always like the color tones vs my canon...but that's just my personal take.UPDATE: now 2 months later.....I am using and loving my camera more...I have finally downgraded and given my beloved Canon to one of my older children. I did find a feature that was very helpful that I use quite often which helps with the color saturation!
