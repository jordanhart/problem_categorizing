The pics are crisp, the design is sleek, and it's fun to shoot with.  I'm excited to give the underwater function a try (with the appropriate kit, of course), and the settings are really useful for a variety of scenes.  The only downside is that I had to buy a Memory Stick, which was a little difficult to find.  Also, it was a bit expensive (25$ for 2G).  However, this price included a memory card adapter, so I didn't have to buy a new card reader for my computer.  All in all, I think this is a great camera!", "Date": "April 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "A.

Pictures turned out great. Love the pink color! Zoom capabilities & pictures are better than my old Canon. Don't like the zoom button placement & Power ON/OFF button. The zoom should be on the front of the camera. Much easier on my Canon to zoom. The Power button is tiny! I have to use the edge of my nail to turn the camera on/off. Other than that...great camera, at a great price.", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Battery life it terrible!", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R1XHR4BCAX5A0O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera has the worst battery life I have ever experienced. I have had many Sony digital cameras. I have to charge this camera or at the very least check the charge level before every use. I am also very sad Sony has moved away from showing remaining battery life in minutes, now we just get the bars and you never know how long the last bar is going to last. Especially when it gets to that last bar in a matter of hours.I wanted to return this camera but my daughter loves it. (I have to make sure it's always charged though.)On another note. Sony has also moved away from in camera charging. You now have to remove the battery and charge it in it's own little charge cradle. Again this is a major hassle. Yes my Nikon & Canon slr's have the same function of charging but their batteries last for months before a charge is required. To me this is just an obvious plot by Sony to make you purchase a spare battery, for a leisure camera and with todays technology this should never be the case. I still own a Sony DSC-P200. A fantastic camera whose battery life always surprises me as being almost eternal. I've taken that camera on a 2 week vacation, shot 100's of pictures and never had to think about the battery. This just shows how Sony have changed and I'm sad to say I think this may very well be my last Sony camera.", "Date": "May 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very nice camera", "Author": "J.

It no longer works.  Through normal use, this camera has \"corrosion\" damage.  The bill to fix?  $250.  It's more than the camera cost.  Sony customer service has been the pits through all of this too.  Nobody cares about fixing the problem.  We have several cameras that are 2 - 3 years old and they still work (and certainly they have been used in FAR harsher conditions than this one.  We are done purchasing Sony products.  Think twice about it.  They can come up with a pretty simple reason why your product does not fall under warranty....PATHETIC.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!!!", "Author": "Adriana Hernandez \"AdrienneAurora\"", "ReviewID": "R35JQDQ417MS95", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I live in Venezuela, and I received the camera 2 days ago... It's great! Im loving it! It's easy to use, the smile shutter works better than I spected, the macro shoot function works very nicely...

I bought it in fall of last year for a trip to Sweden and it was okay. Then this year we took it to Japan. We went on a hike and tried to take a picture of a shrine and heard a very loud \"pop\" sound from the camera. After that the flash never worked again. I called Sony customer support and they instructed me to reset its settings to the factory defaults and try to take a picture with flash, which caused the pop sound again and completely killed the camera for good! Sent it to their warranty repair shop and they later called me to say that it broke because of corrosion which wasn't covered under the warranty and they wouldn't repair it, even though THEIR phone representative's instructions were what broke it for good! I guess Sony doesn't design their cameras to work in the humid hiking trails of their own country. Needless to say, I will never buy a Sony camera again.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sending back", "Author": "Shari Berry \"JustShari\"", "ReviewID": "REYE3SD450C7B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Camera will not turn on.

We've had a Sony Handycam (mini DVD & dig camera combo) for years, but I wanted a small camera that I could easily fit into my purse (since having downsized from diaper bags - yay!!).  This camera is a perfect size and takes great pictures.  My 7 year old also loves using it.  She wants one of her own - she'll have to wait a while!  The pink color is pretty, bright and makes it easy to spot in a dark purse. It's very easy to use, the touch screen is wonderful and the removable rechargable batteries are great.

I read other's reviews and decided to go for it.  Rec'd camera in great cond.  Easy to use and I am very pleased with the quality.  This is one of the best cameras I've ever owned (and I love the pink)!  I was a little disappointed that it takes a different size memory stick than what I already have, but not a big deal.  LOVE the image stablization feature.  Most of my pictures were blurry before, but not anymore!  Totally love that!  Also love the other features of ways to take pics - like night, snow, etc.  Also, like the battery charger, just plugs in the wall - no cords.  Thought the dial to switch between features might be hard to use, but really isn't.  Not real good on the smile feature, I may just need more time, but it does seem easier to just take your own pic rather than having to wait on smile detection.

It was an HP Photosmart with 6MP (which was great at the time) and I loved it.  However, as technology progresses so rapidly, my \"new\" camera was out of date within a year.I waited and looked for a very long time before selecting the Sony Cybershot.  I have always bought other Sony electronics, but was having a difficult time deciding between Nikon, Canon, or Sony for my new camera.  I finally picked this camera for several reasons:- Ease of use- 12MP (one of the best quality cameras on the market)- No batteries required- LOVE the smile-recognition mode, which will only take a picture once a smile is detected.- Excellent priceThe only downsides for the camera that I would have to report are:- It doesn't take a regular memory card, instead it takes an SD card, which is slightly more expensive.- Without a converter, it's impossible to get pictures from the SD card off the camera and onto my laptop (unless you own a Sony VAIO laptop, where there will be an SD-compatible slot for the card).- Sometimes has troubles focusing close up (also may depend on which camera mode is being used).Overall, it's a great camera for an exceptional price, it is sturdy, and it going to last a long time since it's a Sony.", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony Cybershot: A pint sized dynamo", "Author": "June E.
