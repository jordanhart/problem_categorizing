{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty good for a start", "Author": "Rosencrantz", "ReviewID": "R19HB0PJMV2ZJJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After borrowing my brother's digital camera for a trip this summer, I finally caved and decided to invest in my own. After a bunch of online research I settled on this, and I'm pretty happy with it. The only reason I can't enthuse unrestrainedly is because I haven't had the chance to figure out how everything on it works yet - and it has a LOT of features!One of the best selling points for me was the size. This thing is TINY! Everyone remarks on it, and I love the fact that I can stick it in a small purse with room to spare when I'm at parties. And despite the overall size, it has a screen that's large enough to appreciate the composition of the photos you take, both before and after.Another selling point was that it has a Pentax lens, and while I don't know much about cameras, that was a highly-recommended feature on some of the professional photography sites I consulted. Also, the body is mostly metal rather than plastic, making it hardier than some of the cheaper models on the market.It has enough manual features on it that I can play around for different light effects, etc. But when I want a simple snapshot, it has not only a basic snapshot setting, but a couple dozen \"best shot\" features that automatically set the various light sensitivities and shutter speeds, etc.I haven't really had the chance to test it in good outdoors light, since it's winter now and everything's kind of grey, but overall I've been pleased with the photos both in digital form and the few that I've had printed. Some of them have been a bit fuzzy, but I'm convinced that's from my own experimentation with manual settings.Two other important features made this a smart investment for me: long battery life and speed. I have yet to find myself in a situation where I have run out of batteries in the middle of the day (as I did with my brother's camera a couple of times this summer). The startup speed is impressive - you can start to shoot almost immediately after you press the power button - and the recovery speed between shots is negligible. This is a feature that makes it an invaluable snapshot camera.The only drawback I can think of at the moment is that 3MP is probably a bit low for the price I paid for the camera. But since I'm not likely to be making many prints that are any larger than the standard 3 x 5, I'm not too worried about that. The money, as far as I'm concerned, went into the construction and features I was looking for.I think this is a great starter camera for someone who wants something light, portable, durable, generally easy to use but with lots of additional features to play around with to make things interesting. If I were more into photography, I'd obviously want something with more resolution, or an SLR. But as it is, I'm very pleased with my new toy!", "Date": "December 28, 2004"}, {"Title": "CASIO EXILIM EX-Z30 -- Poor Customer Service", "Author": "C. Miller", "ReviewID": "R34NP8S918O9JH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After using the camera for 4 months the battery quit charging. Working with the camera store where it was purchased we determined that the problem was with the camera rather than with either the battery or charger. I returned the camera to Casio for repair. In response I got a repair estimate for $215. (Cassio's flat repair charge is $190 + shipping & handling + sales tax -- for a camera that cost $230.)The customer service rep told me that the 12 month warranty was not valid because the camera had suffered an \"impact.\" After a couple of weeks I finally was able to speak with a manager who told me the case had a \"bad dent\" in it -- although the camera wasn't dented when I sent it to Casio for repair. The manager finally agreed to have the camera repaired as a \"courtesy.\" When the \"repaired\" camera was returned to me the battery still wouldn't charge.Although I liked the camera while it worked, I definitely would not buy another Casio product.", "Date": "November 30, 2005"}, {"Title": "Defective Design; Poor Casio Customer Service", "Author": "Michael W.

LCD screen is not viewable at all. I paid $220.00 for the camera. Call CASIO customer service and they stated the LCD screen is not covered under warranty. I told the customer service person that you have not even seen the camera and I believed that it is a manufacture defect. Service person stated not a defect and sent me to Casio repair dept. They also stated it is not warranted and no a manufactured defect. (With out seeing the camera) Customer service stated it would coast me $217.00 to fix camera. They also stated they if I was not going to fix the camera to send it in to them so they can look over the camera..YA right...Can you say refurbished and sell camera again..STAY AWAY FROM CASIO!", "Date": "March 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "Camera failed to charge", "Author": "Ainsley's Mommy", "ReviewID": "R19L0N3U24WJH1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Like another reviewer, my battery just failed to charge.

That is until my husband carried the camera in his pocket on the way to the car and cracked the LCD screen making it unveiwable.  We have always carried cameras this way and never had a problem.  The warranty specifically states that the LCD is not covered.  When I called Casio they said to go ahead and send it in and the technician would decide if it is covered.  We prepared for the worst - a long process with a cost to repair equal to the price of a new camera.  However, we couldn't believe that exactly one week after we mailed it to Casio it showed up at our door completely repaired - free of charge.  We haven't even received proof of delivery from the post office.  Excellent customer service by any standard.", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Awesome for a 1st", "Author": "G.
