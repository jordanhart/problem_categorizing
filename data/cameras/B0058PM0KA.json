{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good, but not universally useful", "Author": "Tomcat", "ReviewID": "R2H80UB5EW1DZA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My only complaint is that the holes on the bracket didn't line up with the holes on my Klipsch SB-3 sound bar. Apparently the location of the attachment holes on sound bars is not a universal standard.  I would have expected some sort of adjustable extension brackets to compensate for this, but nothing of the sort comes with this product. I had to figure out my own secure way to attach the sound bar to the bracket. I ended up having to go to Lowe's and buying some shelving brackets that I had to hacksaw to get to the right dimension. I also had to design my own special connection nubs to attach my sound bar to my new bracket arms to get the right fit. I'm proud to say I got it all to work, but I didn't think I had to do get involved with the product design to make it work for my particular sound bar. I like the workmanship of the product, but I hope that the future versions of the product accommodate different types of sound bars. If not, plan on a trip to the hardware store and creative thinking if your sound bar doesn't fit.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not compatible with most soundbars. Don't trust Peerless customer service.", "Author": "Consumerist", "ReviewID": "R15B88WFO3OTCT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After exhaustive research, I settled on a peerless tv mount with matching soundbar mount. I confirmed with customer service at Peerless multiple times that this soundbar mount would fit my Polk Surround Bar 9000 IHT. After it arrived, my installer demonstrated that it was impossible to make this mount compatible with my soundbar. Thankfully he had a universal soundbar mount as an option - but nonetheless I ended up paying the return shipping and restocking fees on the ACC-SB. Peerless customer service was dead wrong.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "only compatible with Mythos or Motion 6", "Author": "LostAngeles", "ReviewID": "R4CIT7DSGB3OJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Obviously, a 55 inch television needs a sound system because the built-in speakers are terrible.  This soundbar mount was my only hope of mounting a soundbar on my peerless cart... please note the mount is not intended for the cart.Unfortunately, the holes and screws that come with the mount are only designed to fit a Mythos or Motion 6 brand of soundbar.  I'd never heard of these and had not considered buying one...  Samsung, Sony, Panasonic, LG, Klipsch do not mount to this model.  So, I had to take the peerless mount and a part that came with my samsung soundbar and have them welded together.  It was my only option and it worked.However, I wish I had thought through all of this before purchasing my rolling cart.  I assumed all the attaching and expanding of the system would be a breeze.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Necessary accessory for any soundbar installation!", "Author": "Keith L Taurman", "ReviewID": "R9OHBSDB0R0EF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Quality construction and a must have item if you intend to mount a sound bar.
