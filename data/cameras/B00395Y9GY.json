{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Pocket Camera Value Priced", "Author": "JennyG", "ReviewID": "RS0B4Y6YQ718B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own and use an advanced DSLR, and I didn't expect this camera to perform to the same level or even close. However, I did expect it to be fun, easy, compact and take decent snapshots.  It does all that.  I keep it in my pocket or purse almost all the time.As far as the complaints that any movement creates blurry photos, that is simply untrue.  I snapped some shots from the back of a Harley Davidson motorcycle as it was going about 35 mph down a city street.  The shot was in focus and not blurry at all. Here is the \"trick\".  The more movement you have happening, the faster the shutter speed you need.  Since the camera lacks manual controls, I simply set the camera on the scene mode that would give me this fast shutter speed.  This would be the \"sports\" mode (person running icon). So, the problem isn't the camera. It can and does take focused, sharp shots even with motion, but you need to use the correct setting.  The manual will explain this.This model doesn't have optical stabilization.  It has digital stabilization. So, it will compensate for some camera movement at slower shutter speeds, but not as much as some other systems.  I have not found this to be a deal breaker. I just hold the camera still by bracing against something. Heck I only paid $79 for this camera at my local Big Lots store, and at that price point, I really don't expect every gizmo on the planet.For a small, compact camera, the flash is decent, and indoor shots without the flash do benefit from the f2.8 max. aperture.  This means that more light can make it into the sensor and it will give you a shallow depth of field. Ever seen photos where the background was soft and blurry, but the subject is in focus?? That is \"depth of field\" at play.  Keep in mind, that you will only get this f2.8 aperture at the wide end of the lens, once you zoom in, the max. aperture gets smaller.Some people may think that more than 12 mega-pixels would be better.  Often, the opposite is true with compact cameras.  They have very tiny image sensors to begin with, and cramming more, smaller pixels onto an already tiny sensor often results in even heavier \"noise\" in the photos.  This makes the photos look grainy.  On these compact point and shoot cameras, the camera applies noise reduction to the photo, which often just blurs and softens the picture in order to reduce the \"noise\". So, if you low light photos look blurry, add some light or use the flash, because it's likely the noise reduction being applied to the photo.  Look to keep this camera at ISO 400 or below to avoid this. How do you do that? Try to shoot in good lighting and/or use the flash when necessary. Keeping the aperture number small (not zooming) helps too.If you are looking for a small, value priced camera capable of decent snap shots and some fun video, the DMC-F3 is an excellent choice. To get the most out of this, or any other digital camera, read the manual.And, what's up with the possitive reveiw that gave the camera only 2 stars?? I can only assume this reveiwer doens't understand what the stars mean??", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great entry-level camera", "Author": "THERION", "ReviewID": "R1OLCH85M82F96", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great entry-level camera, cheap, small and light weight, user friendly menus and features, be sure to read the user manual before you use the camera, there are a lot of features hiding there.", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for", "Author": "Kjoy27", "ReviewID": "R181MYFYP5S816", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Positive: Chaep, easy to use, very compact, stylish design, nice menu layout, big lcd screenNegative: Poor picture quality - very blurry with any movement, even with the image stabilizer on; Very slow to take pictures - hard to get a good shot of the little ones as they are smiling and looking a the camera when I hit the button and, by the time the picture snaps, they are off doing something else; Picture display does not rotate automaticallyI downgraded from a Canon powershot because I did not want to spend as much money.

Pauli", "ReviewID": "R20BBH4CV03A1O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Let me start by stating that I am an amateur photographer. I use a Canon DSLR mostly but also own a Panasonic DMC-LZ7 that I carry along at times. The LZ7 is a large camera and has many lens issues but the quality of the photos it takes often surprises me for a camera I paid $126 for. The optical image stabilization is great and the macro mode is as good as any p&s; I have used. Now to the F3.I needed a camera for work. It had to be fairly cheap and a wide angle lens was needed. The F3 was one of the few cameras I found that fit the bill, so I ordered one. Having been impressed by my LZ7, I had high hopes for the new F3 but was sorely disappointed.Here are my complaints with the F31) It gives you horribly over-processed photos. I would guess that they used a very low cost image sensor in this camera because they do A LOT of post-processing. The sensor seems to create a lot of noise and then the camera severely over-sharpens. This creates a terrible blurring-grainy effect that makes the photos only usable full size. Forget trying to do any advanced editing in Photoshop, as the blur-grain makes anything beyond basic color and brightness adjustments nearly pointless. I could go on but there is no need, just understand that the camera way over-processes the images it takes.2) The macro mode is almost useless. With the camera in normal mode, the minimum focus distance is about a foot. With macro enabled it drops that to about 5-6in. With as wide of a lens as this camera has, that is terrible. All the other p&s; cameras I have owned and used will focus down to the point where the lens almost bumps the object you are trying to photograph. This may not be a deal breaker for some people but one of the uses I bought the F3 for was taking photos of circuit boards and components. The best I can say is that it barely suffices for this.3) Low light performance is terrible. The camera supposedly has an \"electronic image stabilizer\" but from what I can figure, it is utterly useless. Also the the camera is very noisy. Basically it is useless without the flash on unless you are in a very bright area.Understand that I know exactly how much this camera sells for, as I bought one, so I know it is not a high end model. But does that excuse the photos it takes? I don't believe it does. After all it is a digital camera, so its first and foremost purpose should be to take usable/functional photos. It does this only barely, if ever.For illustration purposes I will try to take the F3 and LZ7 out for some comparison photos.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "DMC-F3K is NOT optical stabilized, nor is the F2S (digital ONLY),", "Author": "AnAceBuyer", "ReviewID": "RWHH174V1RPT9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Amazon site is incorrect.

The only other cameras in this price range are plasticky toys, but this Lumix has perceptibly good build quality and an impressive feature set. I think it takes very good pictures for a current-range entry-level point-and-shoot, if not quite as vivid and sharp as my old Canon-- but I wasn't expecting that from any camera in this price range (including Canon's new low-end offerings, from the reviews of others who've also owned the older next-level Powershots), and I certainly wasn't expecting shots as good as the F3 takes for what it costs. In other words, the Lumix exceeds my (reasonable) expectations, and it blows away anything else you can currently buy for the money.I don't know what the comments about shot time or blurry subjects are about. I find the DMC-F3 to be VERY fast at committing shots on shutter press-- provided that you've half-pressed to set the focus first (**which you should be doing**, i.e. RTFM on ANY P&S; digital camera). It is definitely faster at committing shots than my old Canon or my wife's Casio Exilim.Even dimly-lit indoor shots are coming out pretty nicely considering what this costs... and the quality of results in movie mode surprised me as well (although, being very averse to installing Apple anything on my PCs, I do wish it didn't use the Quicktime codec... but VLC can play the files with no fuss or required Apple-horrorware installation).If you are expecting pro-quality indoor shots in bad lighting, or need lots of pics of Junior taking first at the track meet, maybe you ought to do a little more research and pony up appropriately for a camera more suited to that job. No camera at this price level is going to do either of those demanding tasks perfectly, and the DMC-F3 certainly does better than I expected for what it cost me. If you just need decent quality painless shots of everyday things and don't have a lot to spend, this is a winner.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "VERY Sub-par to Canon/Nikon Comparables", "Author": "Boogaloo", "ReviewID": "R1J04JTIYPG4V9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this as an automatic box for unexpected moments and very basic video recordings that don't demand lugging around my DSLR.  The performance has been mixed and averages sub-par.  I've chosen to stay away from mind-numbing numbers for the most part and just get to the gist of it.The manual is very sketchy, failing to detail a rather large feature set among four modes:  NORMAL offers the most user exposure setups with size, format and ISO from 80-1600.  AUTO-SCENE let's the camera choose the most fundamental setups.  SCENE (manual) let's the user choose pre-programmed setups appropriate to the occasion. There's a bunch of them.  MOTION PICTURE offers four quality formats from wide HD and WVGA to lowest quality VGA and QVGA in 4:3 NTSC.*The native snapshot format is 4:3 with selects from 0.3MP to 12MP.*It has 40MB built-in memory good for about 20 x 12mp snaps.*An optional 4GB SD card (HC type recommended) expands storage to nearly 1000 x 12mp.*3:2 format (6x4) is at 10.5MP while a 16:9 format shoots at 9MP.*The camera features a burst mode claiming 6 frames per second under reduced resolution ... haven't tried it.*The 4X optical zoom equates to 28-112mm in 35mm equivalent from f/2.8-6.2 in the range with an additional 3.7x digital zoom option.*A fully charged battery is rated for about 100 snaps; in practice, it lasts long enough for an evening get-together or an outdoor 'walk-a-bout' session.All of this looks good on paper, but here's how it has performed ... overall, it's a mixed bag.Snapshots-Daytime:  This meets my mission in NORMAL automatic and appropriate SCENE modes. In good light under f-stops above f/4 and at ISOs below 400, the results are usable in decent focus.  However, I have seen better automatic performance with older cameras with far less pixel resolution, so don't use 12mp as an image quality guide.  As lower light forces ISO 400 or more, and as the lens gets closer to its widest apertures, the results are throwaway; way too soft and noisy.  Even at the price point, I expected much better basic performance than this.Snapshots-Low Light:  Performance is abysmal in room light under normal, auto-scene and appropriate manual-scene modes.  There is excessive wide aperture lens aberration that makes shots look unfocused compounded by a weak flash that works poorly with a typical 1/60 shutter speed for a flash photo.  Subjects MUST be still as a statue or the result is nothing but blur.  If one shoots higher ISO under 'normal' mode, the image becomes pixelated with lots of noise.  Terrible.Video- Daylight and Room light:  Surprisingly, this is the camera's strong feature universally performing quite well with fun results in \"HD\" mode on our 42\" widescreen TV and a supplied USB-to-RCA cable.  This is the last reason I bought it, but it has turned out to be enough fun that I'll live with the overall package.Supplied Software - It completely failed to install on a Windows XP 32-bit machine.  I couldn't tell you if it is intended for 32-bit XP, 64-bit Win 7, both or neither.  The manual and instructions had nothing to say about it and I refused to risk the Win-7 laptop to it.ConclusionWhile the $80 I paid seemed like a good price in the generally regarded Lumix line, knowing this wasn't going to be 'the epitome' of a camera, a quick search in Nikon and Canon lines shows models with consistent 5* reviews for snapshot quality with varying levels of video performance at the same price point.  Oh, well ... woulda, should, coulda ...

I bought 2 of these for my fiancee and me(Oct 2010). Within weeks hers developed darkened pixel streaks in the display. It was NOT dropped or abused in any way. Sent in for repair (at MY COST), came back without CD and Doc, after Panasonic specifically said return ALL that came with the camera. Had to call Panasonic back and get new CD and doc. Now the second camera (mine) is also going dark in sections of the display. Again, never dropped or abused. Going to try and return both for a refund. NEVER going with Panasonic again - VERY disappointed.As follow up (July 2010), could not return the cameras so I am stuck with these, and the third camera - replacement from Panasonic for the first failed unit, has also failed with dark sections in the display.  ALL three cameras had chronic problems with a error message \"MEMORY CARD FULL\" at initial power-on, and required popping the memory card out and in several times before the camera realized that the memory card was NOT full!  A real pain in the neck, especially if your are trying to get a time sensitive shot such as a ball game!  We have since bought a real camera from Fujifilm (FinePix S2940WM).  About $150, but it works and takes fantastic photos!  Please DO NOT waste your money on this trash camera!

This thing is one third the weight of the old one. It is made off almost all plastic. No longer made in Japan. Now made in Indonesie (China). Even the Japs can't keep there jobs at home.  I think the box it came is better built and will last longer than this camera. I would have gladly bought the exact same camera as I had before if they still made it. The camera takes good pictures and works pretty much the same as my old one. A few small changes made on the buttons that I do not care for but can live with. It seems to me to take longer to warm up and it is slower to take pictures. I kept it because I just did not want to deal with sending it back searching for a different one and all the crap that goes with that.
