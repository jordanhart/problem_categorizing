I have shot digital exclusively since 1999 and this is by far the best point-and-shoot I have owned. I usually shoot with a Canon 5D or 1DS Mark II and this little NV10 holds up really well against these and certainly beats all the compact cameras I have owned (Canon, Casio, Sony, Contax). I have printed 16\"x20\" prints from the NV10 after almost no editing in Photoshop CS2. There is a little noise (I shoot the NV10 at ISO 100) and a minor application of Noise Ninja's filter removes any noticeable noise. It is possible that there are manufacturing irregularities that cause one camera to be different from another. If this is the case and yours seems very noisy, send it back and exchange it for another. I took this camera to India for a week and I couldn't pry it out of my wife's hands - she loved the size, responsiveness, image quality, exposure and ease of use.", "Date": "October 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "This is NOT a pro camera, it is an \"All the time - Everywhere\" camera.", "Author": "R.

Many times my gear sits at home because face it, who wants to carry camera gear that weighs more than a small country? Many times I wish I had a camera in my pocket.  I played around with plenty and narrowed it down to this camera and the Canon S3 IS.  The S3 was the winner in many areas except one - size.  I wanted a camera that, when in its case, is still very portable.  I want to toss it in my pocket with my keys and my comb and not have it look like I have a tumor.Yes the Nikon E200 is better.  The lens is what does all the work.  The D200 cannot be taken everywhere, this camera can!I leave it on AUTO and anytime I use the flash I underexpose by 0.7 and my world is fine. The flash is good for close distances, the battery lasts long enough for a day out, and the megapixel rating is simply wonderful.Good points:Metal body!Buttons on the back make selecting menus so very easy!Size, or lack thereof!Lens is covered when camera is off!Screen is pretty much scratch proof!Neutral points:Only a 3x zoom, but any bigger and it would not fit in my pocket.Battery lasts for about 200 shots, so take the charger with you.Extra power battery supposedly available, have not seen it.POWER button is lit and shutter button is not. Folks turn it off when shooting because they press the wrong button.Sounds are all corny.Bad points:When you record movies, the sound is missing for about 2 seconds on each end, so shoot extra and edit later.No power-on lock, you can accidentally power it up in your pocket.AF not so hot in the dark.Overall, if you want a camera small enough to ALWAYS have with you, this is it.

I have digital versions of my brothers wedding photographs that were taken on a digital SLR and the images that I've taken, in similar light conditions, with the NV10 are actually superior in quality.  It is true that in low light conditions when you do not use a flash and shoot at high ISO speeds there is increased grain / noise in the image but that is true for most compact digital cameras.  I'm of the opinion that if you shoot a lot of low light photographs you should use a tripod and shoot at low ISO's with this camera for excellent results.  There are plenty of more technical reviews of this cameras performance on the web and I encourage you to seek them out.  For a very compact camera, this one really has a lot of flexibility and the user interface is intuitive and a pleasure to use.", "Date": "October 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "An Excellent Camera FOR WHAT IT IS", "Author": "Patrick Cooley", "ReviewID": "R1NXA7BPZPY3GG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To compare this camera to a Nikon D200-or any DSLR-is ridiculous: IT IS A POINT-AND-SHOOT! Can you take excellent photographs with an NV10  (good enough for someone else to want to buy)? Yes. Can you do that with any camera? Yes. Photography, from the equipment to the final, printed product, is an entirely subjective endeavor.Build:There is no point-and-shoot on the market in this class equal to the NV10's build quality. (5 stars)Interface:The Smart-Button interface will be used, eventually, by nearly every other camera maker. (5 stars)Design:In camera battery charging was a poor option for obvious reasons. (2 stars)However, considering the overall camera...What former Leica designer moved to Korea? (5 stars)Image:Some reviewers have said that the camera's images have too much contrast and color saturation and complain that there is no way to rectify this in-camera; I somewhat agree. For my tastes, contrast is fine, but only pure reds oversaturate. It would be nice to correct this while shooting, rather than wait to Photoshop it later. However, the shots I have made thusfar have been excellent. As for the noise issue: If it bothers you that much, buy a different camera. Samsung does not claim to be all things to all photographers. If you bought an NV10 and found yourself dissatisfied with the in-camera NR or amount of noise present...tough. Do more research before putting down your money next time. There's always e-bay if you don't want to keep it.Before complaining about noise, use some common sense. A 1 1/8\" CCD with 10.3 million pixels will make noise above 200 ISO. In normal light, 100-200 ISO images are noise-free or at least make noise that looks more like film grain. If you want to shoot in low light, don't free-hand it: Use a flat surface or tri-pod.Consider your planned subject matter and the environment in which you plan to shoot, then select the appropriate equipment.  (4 stars)Software and Stuff:The included software ignores Mac users. IPhoto downloads NV10 images, and Photoshop does its thing, but it would be nice to have access to Samsung's proprietary software. I fear problems when company updates come down the pipe. Also, factory accessories are difficult, if not impossible, to come by. (2 stars)Objective Conclusion of an Entirely Subjective Subject:The NV10 is a great camera for what it is and maybe even the best available at its price.", "Date": "March 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing look & feel. Disappointing image quality.", "Author": "N.

It is, for the lack of a better word, perfect.If only the same could be said about image quality -- this is where the camera is a severe let-down. There is noise; noise everywhere, and even at the lowest ISO setting. There is also a focus issue, with an unacceptable percentage of images being out of focus. My particular copy was backfocusing more than can be attributed to user error. Forget about reliable low-light focusing too; it's mostly a hit-and-miss situation.If I were to sum this camera up in a few words, I'd say design and marketing gone wild. There is no place for 10 MP in this class of cameras, not until they get the image quality right. Look, if all you're doing is look at pictures on your monitor, email them and publish them online, then 3 MP is plenty enough. If you print 4x6, then 5 MP is starting to become overkill. But 10 MP? Give me a break.I am a long-time DSLR user, having used Canon cameras with L lenses. I mention this since I want to be clear that I am not expecting similar output from the NV10. In the end, I could not with a sane mind justify keeping the Samsung, despite its drop-dead gorgeous looks.If you want the best currently available image quality in a point-and-shoot camera, run, don't walk, and buy the Fuji Finepix F30. If however style matters more, then there is nothing out there like the NV10.I so wanted this camera to work out for me.

But I wanted a smaller camera that I could easily carry around everywhere and use at any time.I tried the Canon Elph, the Nikon Coolpix, and others in a local camera store. But they were either too slippery to hold, or too big/heavy, or lacked a decent wide angle, or didn't support decent manual modes. Then I tried the NV10. WOW!SMART TOUCHThe camera manual is a little vague about this. Swipe-and-pause (not press) from one button to its neighbor scrolls pictures one-by-one. Swipe-and-pause across more buttons scrolls faster through multiple pictures. To keep scrolling without swiping over and over, swipe-and-pause but end on the very last button on the left, or on the second-to-last button on the right.The Zoom button lets you zoom out to view multiple thumbnails in a photo album view (swipe-and-pause to scroll left/right/up/down) and then zoom in for the full view of a selected picture.SIZE/GRIPThis camera is skinny! I have (previously) uploaded a picture to Amazon showing the camera with a dime for comparison.It has a decent grip, and it's slightly longer than most of the other comparable cameras I tried. But you could try it in a store to decide for yourself.PICTURE QUALITYIt only supports JPG (no TIFF or RAW formats). By default, it's set on JPG Medium, but you can set it to JPG Fine.To give you a sense of the colors, the grain, issues with the image at the corners, low-light handling, and shake reduction (or not), I have previously uploaded an uncropped picture of some jelly fish (at an aquarium), taken handheld with no flash in Automatic mode. The only light was from the soft/dim light inside the tanks. The room was dark because these jellies don't tolerate light well.MANUAL SETTINGSYou usually only get two F stop choices available at any time. (F2.8 and F7.1 commonly appear, but the these choices change when you zoom.)SHAKE REDUCTIONThe ASR is digital, not optical. So, it's not the same as having a vibration reduction lens. (Also, the manual indicates that you need to enter a special shooting mode to get the ASR. So, apparently you don't get ASR most of the time.)SD CARDThe manual guarantees compatibility with 1GB max. I haven't tried a 2GB card yet.The camera also has 20MB of internal memory built in, so you can actually take a couple of pictures even *before* you buy a card (or after you fill up a card).REMOTEThere's a remote available in certain countries, but I have yet to see it available (by itself, at least) in the US.BATTERY LIFEOnce you get past the newbie need to use up battery life while fiddling with learning to use the camera, it doesn't seem too bad. The batteries are very small (as shown in my uploaded picture), so it's easy to carry a couple of extras.ZOOMThe 3X optical zoom is OK. The newer Samsung NV11 has a 5x optical zoom (but maybe Samsung traded that for something that I would miss). The NV7 has a 7X optical zoom (but it's a bigger camera).I've had the NV10 for nearly a year now, and I'm pleased with it.", "Date": "October 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Pretty Awesome", "Author": "Victor Powell", "ReviewID": "R2HBOGQ04AV46E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is exactly what I was looking for!  This camera rocks! It's the thickness of a dime, and it is bullet proof.  I went on a bike ride in chicago in the rain, and it got wet, and still took great pictures.

When you shoot in a low light situation without a flash the pictures are very fuzzy.  I've found that I can use a higher ISO or change the exposure speeds to get a good picture, or you just turn on the flash. If it weren't for that little hick-up I would give it a 5 star rating.On the USB charging and data transfer cable.  I've found it to be 100%.  If you have a problem with it, send it back to samsung.

At first it was weird but after getting used to it, its great.  Its quick to adjust a setting to make sure your getting a good shot.  Changes are real time so you can see your changes on the screen.  You slide your finger on the touch sensitive buttons.  ISO settings from 100 to 1000.  Although you start getting bad noise above 500.  You can get nice 10mp pic at ISO 200.  Different scene modes are easy to choose.  The flash is strong and spreads well.  Fast startup and shoot times.  Ergonomics are very good.  You can charge the camera with your USB.  Big difference with this camera compared to others is the nice 3-5X zoom.  I don't like the browsing through the taken pictures by sliding on the touch screen buttons, if your not careful it will browse through them way too fast.  You can select and delete multiple pictures in the thumbnail mode which is nice.  Video capture is strong and lets you also zoom while filming.  Audio capture was weak. Maybe I can adjust this? The ASR function doesn't really work, must be a marketing thing since most people want this.

Murray", "ReviewID": "R2WZ2CAXP5YLXN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Casio Exilim EX-Z75 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Anti Shake Optical Zoom (Black)I bought both the Casio and the Samsung right before Christmas last year.  At the time, they hadn't come out with the 10mp Casio or the 11mp Samsung, so these 2 were the best comparison products for ultra slim camera models.  After much comparison, I like this Samsung camera better, and here's why.  The Samsung's battery has a better lifespan and it's also easier to charge.  The Casio battery has to be placed into a charger outside of the camera body and it slips easily, so even when you think it's charging, it's not.  The Samsung's battery can be charged while it's in the camera, which is easier and foolproof.  The Casio's buttons are very small, and even though I'm a girl with delicate fingers, I felt like I had to work awfully hard to get the buttons to work, including the power button and the shutter release.  There are a few things I liked better about the Casio, I like that the flash options are on a button and not inside a menu, it's much faster to switch the flash options.  I also like the roundness of it's design a little better.  As far as image quality, the Casio had some distinctive color fringing in highlight areas, and  distinctive noise in low light situations.  The Samsung has noise too, but it's a little less obvious.  The Samsung's auto focus was faster than the Casio's, also the Casio has a long time delay between focusing and being able to shoot the picture, and in that delay it freezes the shot, so you can't continue to watch the motion, and that was very hard to get used to.  I'd be framing a shot, and while it was focusing, I'd not only lose the moment, but I would end up shooting the ground instead of my cat, because I wasn't able to see what was going on while it was focusing. On the other hand, the Casio's flash seemed to recycle faster.  Also, the Casio's flash is in a better location.  The Samsung flash is located at the top of the camera, so when I would go to take the picture, I almost inevitably had my finger over the flash when it would pop up.  Not a big deal, it hasn't broken or ruined a shot, it's just annoying.  One of the few glitches I've seen with this camera is the macro/close up mode:  I don't know if it's a problem of distance (being too close to the subject) or if there's a deeper problem, but the autofocus will find a spot and pretend to be focused, and then it suddenly switches and is way off.  This doesn't happen on every shot, but enough to be a hassle.I can't remember all of the features of the Casio, but I don't remember it having manual options for shutter speed, iISO or aperture, but I know the Samsung does.  I also don't recall it being able to take Video, but I could be wrong about that also.  The Samsung's video function is a little rough, but it's good to have for those random moments that you wouldn't want to miss.  I'm a professional photographer who was looking for a fun camera to keep in my purse, and after trying these 2 out, I kept the Samsung for myself and gave the Casio to my sister.", "Date": "June 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Dee", "ReviewID": "R195KKFSEFX2JB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my teen before our vacation to Australia.

This camera is so great on paper... *sigh*.Using the highest quality ISO (100) at the best JPEG quality with medium noise reduction, I have to say that if the Nikon D200 RAW image at 10.2MP is a \"10\" on the quality scale, then this Samsung NV10's very best 10.1MP image is no more than a solid 3.The best way to describe the image at 100% is to say it looks like high-quality color printing on newsprint. There is very noticeable noise--linear grain patterns, actually--in all my test images. The color is washed out, although is somewhat improved when changing the camera's sRGB IEC61966-2.1 colorspace to Adobe RGB (1998).I tried using their full auto settings. I used full manual (F2.8 and F7.1 are the only two apertures available). I tried different speeds, even under and over exposing. All images were uniformly poor.I was hoping for a good point and shoot to go along side our D200. While it's true that the body of a Nikon D200 alone is about four times the price (and 10x the weight) of the NV10, the image quality isn't acceptable. I really don't think even a novice shooter will be happy with the results.Finally, the USB cable provides both download and power recharge for the camera. While I love that one cable does both, it took me 10 minutes of fiddling with the cable to realize the data connection is extremely touchy (I'd installed the driver 3 times thinking I just hadn't gotten the software right).It takes lots of careful wiggling near the camera-end of the USB cable to get the connection noticed by Windows XP Pro; I'm assuming this may be a hardware issue limited to my own NV10.Hopefully Samsung has a firmware upgrade that will substantially improve the image fidelity and color space for this ergonomically perfect little point and shoot.", "Date": "September 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Samsung NV 10", "Author": "Digital Photographer \"Used to Like Nikon,s\"", "ReviewID": "R19DAZOYGTLQ1N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a beautiful highly styled camera, but, the lens is terrible,  and also very inconsistent, sometimes not bad.The manual is a waste of paper, telling you nothing.The controls are awkward and not conventional, sometimes not working well at all.Samsung should have done their homework better, this camera is a dog and not worth the money, had Samsung gone a bit farther this could have been a winner, as is, it is a loser.", "Date": "April 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "refurbished bit o junk", "Author": "Matty von Studly \"His Geekiness\"", "ReviewID": "R2FKPHQ80ZHQL8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not really fair to judge on a refurbished camera that didn't work at all, but it felt nice in my hand, and the sellers (whose name escapes me) were nothing short of stellar.Since the camera didn't work I didn't have a chance to work through the learning curve on the non standard user interface...Probly won't be getting a samsung anytime soon", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "OK camera, terrible customer support", "Author": "Alexander Kanevsky", "ReviewID": "R3CZAKMKUMMRNG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera itself is OK, no complaints.

Rosales", "ReviewID": "R2LYMIGC561JHU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I, like everyone else who bought this camera, was won over immediately by this camera's design. It is by far the most beautiful digital camera I have ever seen or heard of. The retro design is really sweet.BUT, the image quality leaves something to be desired. If the lighting is right, the quality is fine, but should you ever want to take a photo in low-light conditions (enough light to take a clear shot) without a flash, the resulting image has so much noise that it looks as if it was taken w/ a $15 webcam. Also, images of things in direct sunlight are so washed out that most if not all detail is lost. If you don't mind using the flash whenever there is inadequate ambient light, then go for it.This is Samsung's first stab at a high end digital camera, and i'd say that they should try again. It's Korean garbage in a pretty package.and to the person who wrote this:\"I am frankly a little puzzed by others' comments about the image quality of this camera. I have shot digital exclusively since 1999 and this is by far the best point-and-shoot I have owned. I usually shoot with a Canon 5D or 1DS Mark II and this little NV10 holds up really well against these and certainly beats all the compact cameras I have owned (Canon, Casio, Sony, Contax). I have printed 16\"x20\" prints from the NV10 after almost no editing in Photoshop CS2. There is a little noise (I shoot the NV10 at ISO 100) and a minor application of Noise Ninja's filter removes any noticeable noise. It is possible that there are manufacturing irregularities that cause one camera to be different from another. If this is the case and yours seems very noisy, send it back and exchange it for another. I took this camera to India for a week and I couldn't pry it out of my wife's hands - she loved the size, responsiveness, image quality, exposure and ease of use.\"The bad image quality seems to be the rule, not the exception.

If you don't use a case, and you place the camera in your pocket, it easily turns on.  When it turns on, by default the zoom lens extends.  In my pocket, it twists the lens and breaks a gear.  I try to turn the camera off and the lens will not retract.  For a few times, I can start the camera by twisting the lens but thereby break even more gears.  Eventually, the camera will not even turn on.The camera is great, but does show some graininess in low light conditions (photographing concerts).
