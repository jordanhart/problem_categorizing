It has pretty good pixels, zoom, and is very small (great for your pocket or for a very small handbag). It did worry me however, how light it was. But I am not so worried now, because I even bought the 3 year (Accidental Drop/Handling) Warranty and am very glad I did...it seems pretty truthful and helpful! As for why I bought this camera... I already have a very nice Kodak M580 (even with 8x zoom and 14 mp) but it is very unreliable because it freezes up when I need a picture most. The Kodak, is also very heavy and large. So I decided to buy this small, compact, good camera on Black Friday (for a like $15 discount). I think its pretty great. The buttons are positioned in good places, except for the flash, which you have to get to on the menu (making it a little more difficult for quick snap-shots).", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!!", "Author": "Bumble", "ReviewID": "R3IKT145MPTT8M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my mom to replace her old and slow camera.

When I read a magazine review, I was for some reason intrigued by this. Then I saw it was on offer. And got it. I love the size. The VG 20, 130 and 140 have more features but is a lot bigger. I like that it's small but not too small. The Minox is darn hard to use, especially the shutter release. This one, I like a lot. Hold it correctly, vertically between first finger and thumb and you can even sneak shots without composing at 27mm. Some reviewer say it's smaller than a pack of cards, maybe so, but I'm trying to fit it into a ciggie box. The VG110 is Bloody Good.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Such a great camera for an awesome deal!", "Author": "KDubs322", "ReviewID": "RM6NXY9SOQTGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My previous camera was an Olympus so I wanted to keep it in the family. With minimal time and money, this was my first option as a replacement. I love this camera! It's so lightweight and small and can easily fit in your pocket. Has a lot of cool effects that are easy to navigate: face detection, fish eye lense, negative effect and the coolest of them all.. the panoramic option! Pictures come out crisp and clear with the awesome 12mp. Charges quickly. Just overall a great camera for a great price.

THe zoom does not go extremely far but the wide angle makes up for that. The 12 mp resolution does a nice job with details.Down side it feels very light and not very tough sounds like cheap internal workings and the auto flash seems to like to go off even in sunlight.

I've had 2 cameras over the last year or so.  Samsung TL series which i washed it in the washing machine for a whole cycle.  I left it to dry (using the whole rice in ziploc technique) and it worked without a flaw.  I buy this camera to back up just incase my samsung dies, and i left it in the car for couple days and it started to break down so i sent it for warranty repair.  Supposely the camera suffered a corrosion damage due to liquid.  I used this camera twice and left it in my car for couple days.  I guess its my fault for giving the camera too much \"liquid or humidity\" to handle.Since when does humidity provide more liquid than a whole cycle worth of water in the washing machine.Think before you buy.
