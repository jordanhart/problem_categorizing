I was going to get the Canon SD30, but the reviews on the V530 were better. I was initially rluctant, since Kodak has not been a major force in the digital field.I read all reviews from 20 sites (OK..a bit obsessive), took sample shots in stores,and took a chance on this camers (I figured that I would pay a restock if needed). Well, I am overwhelmed. There is NO red eye issue (my biggest fear). The pics are sharp, focused, and the colors are accurate. There is no lag, and the pocket size is perfect. My only complaint is that there are TOO many pre-selected modes to choose from. I have spent hours experimenting. I wish that there were fewer choices....The battery life issues are moot to me, since I ALWAYS buy an extra battery for every digicam--it's a no-brainer. I rate battery life as average for this camera.Overall, I am impressed. No regrets.", "Date": "March 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Ehhh, could be better...", "Author": "Katie", "ReviewID": "R90S4UNA7NZH7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a replacement for my Casio Exilim Ex-Z40. The price was right, all the reviews seemed decent, but I am not nearly as satisfied with this camera as I was with my Casio. I have experimented a lot with this camera and I can never get true-to-life colors with it. People always seem really washed out, and the night picture settings only work if you have a tripod. The pictures are often slightly blurry, plus the battery doesn't last long enough for me. The screen isn't that big, and there are way too many buttons for people other than me to figure out. The only thing I do like about this camera is how good the red-eye setting is. Either way, my next camera will definitely be another Casio, or a Sony.", "Date": "June 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Jess", "ReviewID": "R1RH0RD9KCK3H1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because while I was traveling, my camera broke in my bag.
