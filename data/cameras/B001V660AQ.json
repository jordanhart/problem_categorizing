No, there is not a lcd screen to review or preview your shots.  You will not find one on ANY film camera from any maker.  I have an older model of this camera and it works great.  It is very basic (no autofocus, shutter priority or aperture priority).  But the glass is good and will take good pics.No lcd!! lol :D", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "vivatar's new manual 35mm camera", "Author": "JB4", "ReviewID": "R3C6LD9XSHSC0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera was pretty good once I learned how to use it.

It's the perfect thing for beginners and photography class 101. I'm having a lot of fun and getting used to setting the aperture and really taking nice photos. This is a SLR camera so if you want a digital camera that has photo previews,  this isn't the one for you. Tgw only thing I'm having trouble with is the battery tgat came with it. Supposedly if I put it in, I'm supposed to see a red/green light to know that it works, but eithe way that I turn the batteries,  I don't see any light....maybe idk where to look or just gotta get used to the camera first.But nothing was broken on the camera during shipping which is greattt. It comes with the strap, the 28-70mm lens, batteries,tne protection case and a split screen lens. Honesty for under $200 I'm VERY pleased with this camera.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "quacka", "ReviewID": "R3VFBCTT4UUY6W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great camera, easy to use, but the included strap broke and the camera almost fell off. the eye piece would pop off multiple times. other than those, it is an amazing camera.

I thought it was a great deal and I couldn't wait to get it. Well, when the camera arrived I was terribly disapointed. Not only was it very cheap in construction, it didn't have a LCD picture view screen. I was shocked that cameras were still being made without the LCD screen. I couldn't use the camera because I would have wasted a lot of time and money going back and fourth to the pharmacy just to view the pictures. I thought this was a waste of money, I wouldn't pay 20 dollars for a camera like that. I sent it back and got a full refund from amazon.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$239.00", "Features": "Ideal 35mm SLR for Students\nManual Focus & Exposure\nManual Loading, Advance, Rewind\nAccepts Pentax K Lenses\nIncludes Fitted Case", "Name": "Vivitar SLR Camera with 28-70 Zoom Lens (VIV-V3800-2870)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZbgtTfqiL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001V660AQ"}}
