The touch screen made it very easy for me to navigate and change the settings. As a beginner in photography, this helped me a lot.As for the other items, they were ok too.  The Vivitar padded case bag and the holster bag wear very good.However, I'm very dissapointed with the TTL Flash and the Tripod. They're both useless. the Flash is so slow and you can't even use it in a dimmed area 'coz it won't flash.  The tripod is so light I'm worried it could be toppled by the wind.But the T41 with the 18-135 STM lens is a very good camera. I've already bought the 50mm f/1.8 lens and UV filters.  I also bought a more sturdy tripod as I'm planning a trip with my family in the near future.BTW, thank you Amazon for your assistance with regards to this order.Rene LR", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Facundo", "ReviewID": "R1ER6OQKE93LMQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent.

It even has the pinch to zoom in or zoom out gesture.  The pictures are sharp and beautiful with rich color.  The 18-200mm lens has an auto-focus switch and an auto-stabilization switch so you can customize your shots.  It also has a lock switch so you can protect the lens while traveling.  This kit also comes with a very nice TTL flash attachment.  It has almost a 360 degree rotation so you can defuse its light off any wall or the ceiling.One disadvantage with the 18-200mm lens, if the lens is held vertical (shooting directly down or directly up), between the range of 24mm and 80mm the lens does not hold its zoom, it will slide back to 24mm (if you are pointing it up) or 80mm (if you are pointing it down) because of the weight of the lens.  Mine is not the only one that does this, I was talking to someone else who got this exact same lens and he has the same problem.I didn't give this kit a full 5 stars because the included Vivitar 2.2x lens is not compatible with the 18-200mm zoom lens in this kit.  The Vivitar 2.2x lens has 52mm threads rather than 72mm, which means it would work fine with the 18-55mm lens.  So If I get a lens with 52mm threads, it will be a good attachment.Also the camera Main Dial did not work (not the Mode Dial, the Mode Dial works fine).  I got the warranty, so I just need to go in and get that fixed.  And there are other ways to make those adjustments in the mean time.If I were to buy a DSLR starter kit again, I would buy this one.  All in all it is a great setup.Update:Apparently the Vivitar 2.2x lens can be used with this kit. Simply separate the two parts of the macro lens, then you can screw the Vivitar 2.2x lens on to the end of the Macro lens.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,159.00", "Features": "18.0MP APS-C CMOS Sensor, ISO 100-12800, Expandable to 25600 and DIGIC 5 Image Processor for high speed and excellent image quality\n3.0\" Vari-angle touch screen LCD flips out and tilts for viewing from a wide variety of angles.
