{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Samantha Lowrie", "ReviewID": "R764SW4FBLO93", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband got this for me as a replacement to my aging Nikon D70. First the color, I love it. It is a true red, and not a pinkish color. The camera has a good weight to it and feels very sturdy without being to heavy. The attached lens works well and produces good images. I am a hobby/enthusiast and am starting to study photography, this camera more then does the job. Best thing is that the anti-shake technology is built into the camera, and that makes the lenses much cheaper. Having come from Nikon, where the anti-shake is in the lens, this is a huge relief. the same lenses are considerably less expensive. It will also take any Pentax lens ever made, and that is huge. You can find good used lenses at photo shops and second hand stores and save a bundle!I am still learning the menu systems but they are pretty smooth so far. If you mess up your settings, there is a reset function that will reset all of your settings back to factory, and the auto setting always works. It seems to write to the disk pretty fast too. It also does HDR shooting. I am still playing with this so I can't speak to the quality of those images yet.I am very happy with this camera, and I will be sticking with Pentax!!", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "From *ist DS to K-r", "Author": "Anaguma", "ReviewID": "R3A6CK3WPL25JO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a *ist DS, mainly because I wanted better cropping options than the 6.1mp DS gave.Pros on the upgrade:  1) K-r has 12.3 megapixels and 2 format options for a RAW image (DNG & PEF).  2) It also has a \"green button\" which can be assigned various functions, but I assigned RAW to it so I can take most of my shots on jpg, but when I think I want to save it with the original 12-bit data, I just push the green button and it saves it as both jpg and RAW.  3) Stabilization built into sensor.  This allows me to use all my old glass lenses with stabilization.  I generally can focus faster than any autofocus because I know what I want in focus by looking.  Having the anti-shake for these old lenses is nice.  4) It takes great low light photos up to 1600.  Some flat areas, such as a dark sky, will show noise at 1600 that can be removed with post processing (select/blur).  5) It has ISO priority choice (Sv) where you can set the ISO speed and the shutter and f-stop will adjust around your choice of speed.  6) SCN functions which I have set to Museum as another \"No Flash\" mode.  7) It works with old Pentax program flashes but not TTL mode.  You have to read the chart on the back of the flash.  8) Frames per second is fast.  9) Still works on 4 AA batteries (with optional expensive adapter - should come with it as standard) which is handy for travel.  You can always find AA batteries.  10) Menu system is easy and fast - no scrolling down necessary.  11) Info button gets you a status screen, and if pushed again, a page of shortcuts, such as white balance, custom exposure, HDR, and meter mode.  12) The big screen is really bright and sharp.  I mainly use it to review photos which I couldn't on the *ist DS.  13) Some post-processing functions that are mainly for fun, that are found on Point and Shoot Pentax cameras (colorization, BW, Toy Camera?).  14) It takes movies if you want, but I didn't get it for this so haven't used it much.  The one video I took seemed sharp and smooth when playing back on a PC, but the sound was terrible with a mic that picked up everything.  15) It has live view when you can't use the viewfinder.  It's easily activated/deactivated by a single button on the back of the camera. It has the same problems on sunny days as all the other cameras with an LCD screen for a viewfinder, but it's really handy at night or when you can't get your eye to the viewfinder.  16) You can put the camera on manual control for complete control of shutter, f-stop, & ISO speed.  17)  The K-r is one of 3 Pentax DSLRs that at the moment support the O-GPS1 attachment for the hot shoe (the others are the K-5 and the 645).Cons:  1) *ist DS has a glass Pentaprism, which is brighter than the K-r penta-mirror system.  2) *ist DS has a CCD sensor, while the K-r is a CMOS (the top digital pro cameras have CCD sensors - i.e. Hasselblad CFV-39; Leica S2; ).  I guess there are pluses and minuses to both, but there must be some reason the big names go with CCD on their top cameras.  3) Finding the K-r exposure bracketing settings isn't intuitive on the K-r. [I found it - it's the wheel when you choose autobracket mode.]  4)  both cameras only bracket with 3 exposures.  To get more, you need to change the exposure compensation.  Only the K-5 (of the new line) comes with a 5 exposure bracket.  5)  *ist DS has a top LCD readout.  I miss it on the K-r.  6)  The dial turns too easily on the K-r.  It can turn just by brushing against it.  I've caught it so far when it changes.  7)  There is no external mike port.  If I wanted to take movies, I think I'd want a decent microphone, and not the omni-directional mike that's built in.  8)  NiMH batteries last a lot longer, but you have to buy a $40 adapter to use them.  You can get Chinese copies of the adapter for $5 on eBay.  9)  There is no power port for a power adapter.  The AC adapter fits into the battery compartment and the power port is on this adapter.  This makes the Pentax K-AC109 AC adapter expensive:  $80.  I use a pile of NiMH batteries for copy work, instead.  10) TTL flash doesn't work.  It did on the *ist DS, which is one reason I got it.  My old TTL flashes only work in manual or program mode now (check the voltage before you put an old flash on a DSLR as some are too high to use with the newer cameras).  My Pentax AF200T and Vivitar 285 both work in manual mode and their voltage is low enough to be safe.  This mainly means you have to manually set the f-stop on the camera to match the power of the flash.I've tried the built-in HDR and I sometimes get good results, but sometimes just a single exposure comes out better.Going from the *ist DS to the K-r was an overall improvement, especially for the shake reduction and higher resolution.Also, the camera comes in standard black, Storm-Trooper white, and candy apple red.  I got the red because it was cheaper where I got it.  It grows on you and you don't ever have to look for it.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "adaragan", "ReviewID": "R1S2B7GJ8OVMST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price, it doesn't get much better than this.

I turned it on as soon as the battery charged and after several hours of trial and error, I began to get the hang of things. By the end of the first day I have many great pictures. The quality is very clear and the colors are nice and bright which always makes the picture look more warm. The camera feels sturdy and the Kit lens is actually quite nice.Also the camera body is a nice bright red which I think makes a great statement. After reading a bit of the manual, installing all programs and figuring out how to operate the machinery, you couldn't ask for a better quality camera given the price. Start up is also VERY fast, turn it on and you're ready to shoot then and there.

She makes lots of youtube videos, takes lots of pictures, and her point and shoot was lacking.  She was taking pictures in the auto mode in a few minutes, and absolutely loves the camera.  It's very easy to get the hang of with a few minutes of spare time.  My sister is very keen of the cross filters built into the camera.  Our family has numerous point and shoot cameras from almost every major brand(Nikon, sony, cannon,GE, samsung, etc.) I even have a pentax optio W80, and this simply blows them away in every aspect except portability, obviously.  I had hoped the video would be a little better quality in low light, but I can't expect Pentax to work miracles.  Although this is damn close to doing just that, especially considering the price.Thanks Pentax!From a proud Optio W80 owner.Edit:My sister has owned this camera for quite some time now, and has really gotten the hang of it.  Almost all the effects in the attached video were done on camera.  It really is a very capable camera, I just wish you could remotely control it from a laptop like some cannon DSLRs, that would make it capable of great movies with it on dollies, camera jibs, etc.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid Digital SLR", "Author": "J Anthony \"tinglassman\"", "ReviewID": "R2BBPWC88FBLMN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a Pentax fan, have been for 30+ years. Why:1) Pentax has never changed the diameter of the lens mount. Thus any Pentax lens made, will fit any Pentax camera, no adapter required.2) Pentax puts the anti-shake in the body. Thus, all your lenses benefit from anti-shake. Canon & Nikon continue to hmm and haww about doing the same. Instead, they put anti-shake in the lens, which is one reason Canon & Nikon lens continue to be pricey.  I hear Canon is coming around to Pentax's way of thinking3) Pentax anti-dust technology is some of the best. Additionally, they have more points of water resistance on their cameras compared to the others.You can get this camera in the US in red, black or white. Yet, you can order it from Europe in Chocolate brown, yellow, blue, lavender & pink too. The cost to ship from Europe is really no different than US rates.  You can also go to the Japan site and pick from approximately 50 other colors, or mis-match colored parts; if you are in desire of a really eye catching camera as seen here on YouTube [...]If you order from Japan, takes about 6 weeks to have them made up.  Personally, I love the red, get lots of \"wow\" from passersby and they can't believe it's a Pentax. The yellow is also pretty cool.This camera has operated great from day one. Any beginning DSLR user will easily adapt to the camera and the menu is easy to use. It comes with the standard 18mm - 55 mm lens, but remember, any previous Pentax lens will snap right on. If you have an older, or find one at a garage sale, pentax lens, say 1960s, and it's say 100mm lens, it will snap right on this body, and it will double it's focal length to 200mm due to the Digital body.It's very light weight.  Here's the kicker. While in Hawaii (my 1st trip), both sides of my strap just came right off. To this day, cannot figure out how that happened. The camera went crashing to the parking lot from around my neck. NOT A BIT OF DAMAGE!!!!  It worked perfectly, with a very small 1/8\" nick on the bottom. I was rather stunned by it all.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "An excellent starter DSLR", "Author": "Prodigal Knot", "ReviewID": "R2PI4ZNK011BGH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have long wanted to get a better camera than the frustrating Point and Shoot type. Way back in the film days, I had a nice Yashica and my wife an Olympus SLR. In 2001 I finally went to digital and haven't looked back. But even the best compact P&S; cameras try too hard to take the picture for you, so if you are like me and want to have control over as many aspects of your photography hobby, then you need to graduate to a DSLR. And Pentax makes one of the best, in my opinion.The K-r is primarily made using an alloy body which is expertly encased in high impact glossy plastic. The hand grip is just that. It has a very natural shape for my hand, which is medium sized, and I can wave the camera around all I want without worrying I'll lose my grip. As others have mentioned, Pentax has retained the K mount which is backwards compatible with just about any lens that Pentax or Asahi have produced for Pentax cameras over the years. Another great feature is the fact that every time you buy new lenses you don't have to pay for the image stabilization like you do for Canon and Nikon since Pentax has built it into the camera body.Recommendations:I would recommend from the outset that you get the camera with the kit lens, if you are just getting into DSLRs or returning as I did. The kit 16-55mm is not the best, but it is more than sufficient in clarity and ease of use to get familiar with this kind of photography. Once you've become comfortable with the camera and all the features it provides, then you can move on to better lenses and filters. Do not waste your money on a weatherproofed lens as the K-r is NOT weatherproofed. That means you have to be careful about using it in wet or rainy environments, but that is a small price to pay to have such a nice camera at this price point. By the way, the Canon and Nikon entry cameras are also not weatherproofed. If you plan to photograph outdoors in the rainy NorthWest, you might want to consider the Pentax K-30 Weather-Sealed 16 MP CMOS Digital SLR with 18-55mm Lens (Blue).I would also recommend you obtain at least one extra NiMh battery for backup. I was able to take as many as 300 photos in Raw mode on a recent outing without having to swap batteries, but a backup is always a good idea.Since there is no cable shutter release option, I would recommend buying the cheaper Pentax remote Pentax Remote Control F for Pentax Digital Cameras or the use of a good tripod and becoming familiar with the shutter timer and drive options.I would also recommend you purchase a good camera case with room to spare for the additional lenses you will probably purchase. One shoulder pack I recommend is the Case Logic DCB-309 SLR Camera Backpack (Black) or, if budget is an issue, the Case Logic SLRC-201 SLR Zoom Holster (Black). The Lowe Pro stuff is good, but overpriced, I think.All in all, the 6 frames per second shooting speed in continuous mode, the lightweight yet sturdy construction, realistic color capture, the extremely adjustable time lapse option, the \"in-focus\" shooting feature (to capture something that just happens to come by when you aren't around), the \"Live View\" display, the decent viewfinder and high res LCD display panel, not to mention the easy to navigate menus, all work to make this a gem of a camera for an entry level DSLR.I don't use or care that much about the movie taking ability, but it is better than many P&S; cameras. Of course there are limitations: you cannot autofocus while shooting a movie and the sound is monaural.Would I buy this again? Absolutely! I looked at the Nikon D3100 and the Canon EOA Rebel T3i before purchasing the Pentax (sight unseen) primarily because of other recommendations and the plasticky feel of both of the other cameras and the heft of the Nikon. I didn't care for the new Sony NEX-5 compact DSLR hybrid or any of the super zoom choices out there. Too many compromises for the sake of portability.Good luck with your decision and remember that taking photos involves practice.

Several times I called Pentex support for BASIC help, i.e, it took  two days with their help just to format the SD--- they were very knowledgable, helpful, and patient and would recommend them highly.Short story ==too complicated for me, but it took some great pictures inspite of the operator's ignorance.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "A GREAT CAMERA FOR THE PRICE", "Author": "Richard Berthel \"imahobo\"", "ReviewID": "RVGYP1IGGMNFV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS CAMERA IS LOADED WITH SO MANY FEATURES THAT I HAVE  SO MUCH TO LEARN YET.SO FAR THIS CAMERA HAS EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "A fantastic starter camera that will let you make professional looking images on a bit of a budget", "Author": "W.

I use it to this day and have taken some great shots over the last couple years.With the K-r you get a fully functional DSLR thats great for learning. It may not have as nice of a sensor as the K-5 or K-7 so it doesn't perform quite as well in low light (but its fine for most lighting and with some help holding it steady you can make due just about anywhere). It also isn't quite as fast as some of Pentax's upper end camera's, but at close to 6 fps you shouldn't have any problems shooting your kid's next soccer game.The camera comes with many \"helper\" modes that make it easy to pick the right settings for your situations. The pets and kids setting speeds up the shutter speed to decrease blur. The food setting adjusts the white balance which helps make your food photos a little more appetizing. There are other settings pre programed for night photography, portraits, etc. All of these are great for getting you going right out of the box which is nice because I've always been a little intimidated by DSLRs and getting a few nice pictures out of the box was great.From there I started moving through the more advanced modes; setting my own aperture size, exposure time, shutter speed, etc. The only problem is that to really use some of these modes you need the appropriate lenses. For instance the kit lens cannot use as large an aperture (small aperture number relates to a large opening) as say a 50mm lens. But if you're just getting started you may not want to go out and drop a few hundred dollars on a 50mm lens let alone multiple lenses. So what are you to do. If you've picked a pentax camera you're in luck the mount is back compatible with a wide range of older lenses like the Pentax A-series (which can be used in all exposure modes and K,M,and S mounts which can be used but you'll have to manually adjust the aperture. These lenses are significantly less expensive than the fully automatic lenses (look for them used in camera shops) and they force you to learn about your camera while giving you full creative control. If you decide you really like photography and want to spend $500+ per lens so that you don't need to adjust things manually you'll only be out a fraction of that and the knowledge you'll have gathered will continue to serve you well.If I was looking to purchase a strong DSLR that will grow with you as you really get into photography this is it. The build quality feels solid. Your options with manual lenses are great and with all the help settings you'll be taking great photos from day one.5 stars", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera but a bit expensive", "Author": "Xin Gao \"Xin Gao\"", "ReviewID": "R2R2RTN3L4IU5U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this camera, but my exGF purchased that through my account.
