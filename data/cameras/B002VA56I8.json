But unfortunately, close isn't quite good enough.The pros:Video is awesome, in all of the modes.Stills are very good quality, the timelapse feature is fantastic.It's waterproof.The mounting options are (almost) limitless.The cons:It's awkward to set up. Menu is like something from 20 years ago.Firmware issues have yet to be addressed by the manufacturer. This is inexcusable as the camera has been available for sale for nearly a year.Audio is useless. They could have saved weight and cost by just not including a mic. The only instance where it even sort of works is when mounted right near a loudish sound you want to highlight, such as an engine.There are too many instances where \"Macgyvering\" is required to get the desired result. The quick release mount rattles so you need to tape the base plate, the non waterproof back allows too much wind noise, so you need to tape over the openings, the shutter button rattles, so you need to tape over that. Moral of the story: BUY TAPE.The support by the manufacturer is not quite adequate. I realize it's a small start up company, but for all the issues with the use of the camera and the handling/editing of the files, they really need to release some conclusive videos or articles to address these concerns.People who might find this camera useful:Auto racing enthusiastsMountain BikersSailorsHobbyist videographers looking for those unique shotsPeople who will likely be disappointed and frustrated by this camera:Pretty much anyone who thinks they'll be using it as a camcorder.People who aren't really tech savvy and/or have an older computerPeople who don't like to tinker and engineer solutions to make it do what they want.******UPDATE******* ******UPDATE******* ******UPDATE******* ******UPDATE******* ******UPDATE*******As of September 7, 2010, Gopro released the new firm ware for the camera.

I have used both the strap mount for my vented bicycle helmet as well as the permanent stick on mount for my dual sport motorcycle helmet.  In both cases, the mounts work as well as the camera.  I still have the previous generation GoPro HERO in standard definition, but not in the wide field of view lens configuration like the current HD version.  I like the wide field of view of this HD model.  It is great at giving a very good view of both the trail as will as your handlebar movements while riding both my mountain bike or motorcycle.  The quality of the video is fantastic.  The files do get large, but that is to be expected with the high resolution of this camera.  I have been using a 16GB SDHC card and have filed up about half of it on one battery charge.  I would recommend a high speed card reader to improve the download times from the card.  A 12 min video was nearly a gigabyte.  The battery last I think longer than the previous standard definition camera which ran on AAA batteries.  I think that I will buy an additional battery someday for long rides with lots of action.The only reason I have not given it a full 5 stars is the difficulty in reading the small status screen with all the various modes it has. The same issue I have with the standard definition HERO. The icons that tell you if you are in burst, still, timed, or video mode are very small across the top of the display.  The numbers to tell you the number of pictures or videos taken are much larger.  It is just difficult if you have the camera mounted on top of your helmet and you try and look in the mirror on your bike to see if the camera is on and what mode it is.  You have to use the select button on the front to both turn the camera on and select the right mode.  The shutter button is on top and is easy to operator even with gloves. It is not difficult to read the display if you are holding the camera in front of you, but much more difficult when mounted on top of your helmet.  You can unclip the camera from the mount, but that can be difficult when it is on top of your helmet.I am looking forward to the expansion port options being available, like the LCD screen to view the videos in the field.  I am also thinking of investing in the chest strap mount so I can get different view over the handle bars as will as making it easier to see the small status display.  Other than the small icons telling you which mode, this is a very nice camera that takes very high quality action videos.  It is very small and light and easy to use when you have it in the right mode.  I would highly recommend this camera to anyone wanting action videos of their bicycling, motorcycle, or skiing activities.", "Date": "January 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Super Sports Camera", "Author": "P. Claxton", "ReviewID": "R3BHGT18PAZT4H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this HD camera to replace a VholdR Wearable Camcorder (Black) which didn't survive getting run over by my SUV. The Hero is a well constructed camera, very solid feeling with quality construction.Pros: The camera has four modes - video (in several resolutions), still pictures, self-timer still pictures, and interval photos (pictures every few seconds). The lens gives a tremendously wide wild view which is nice for HD's 9:16. It will shoot 1080p, 960p 720p (at 30 and 60 frames per second), and 480 (at 60 frames per second) line resolutions. It uses standard SDHC memory cards and has an internal battery which recharges via a USB cable. The recorded audio is very good both inside and outside of the motor sports waterproof case that came with my kit. Video is relatively good, not as vivid as a dedicated camcorder but the resolution is good. My kit came with a variety of mounts and a suction cup mount for windows and car body use. The waterproof case comes with two backs, one that is watertight and one that is not for better audio when waterproof use isn't required. The kit comes with connectors for connecting the camera up to an HDTV monitor (component video) or a TV monitor (composite video). A neat feature in the menu is that you can flip both the video and still photos so you can shoot with the camera upside down without a problem.Cons: The quick release mounts have a bit of wiggle to them. The back of the waterproof case can be difficult to lock closed. The menu system is a bit troublesome to use as there are only two buttons and three LCD characters to use. Once set you'll not have to go into the menu very often.Future: There's a connector on the rear that GoPro plans on using for an external battery or a monitor. Neither are available at the time of this review but they are being worked on.In use on the trail the mounts worked very well. I used the suction cup primarily to mount the camera to my windshield, bumper, side body panel, and side window. Across rugged rocky trails the camera held firm and the video came out very well. The simple interface was easy enough to use. One button to turn the camera on and select the mode and another to stop and start the recording.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "SHOULD BE the best sports camera BUT.....see UPDATES", "Author": "AK", "ReviewID": "R1B37B2X9O55E2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am extremely happy with this camera.  I use it on my GSXR-1000 in the twisty roads for great action HD video as well as mount it to my radio controlled sailplane for great HD video of the flying area.  The picture quality is astounding and shake free.  The video is eye watering on a plasma TV or wide screen projector during playback.The kit is very complete with a large assortment of mounts.  I'm surprised that there are so many mounts and that they don't try to charge extra for them in an \"additional\" kit.  Supposedly the camera is waterproof to 180 feet and comes in a waterproof primary case (that can be removed).Overall, I don't know how they can deliver so much product for so little cost, I am completely happy....get your own :)UPDATE 09/05/2010I am having an issue that appears to be fairly common with other GoPro HD users.  When you finish a video and hit the shutter button to stop recording, the video gets corrupted due to some issue with the camera, the SD card, or a file allocation issue with the firmware.  I am using a high quality Class 4 SD card and know it works fine with other hardware.  I am seriously unhappy that after a weekend of great video, the SD card is corrupted after multiple reformats and everything else in the book.  I understand a firmware is in progress but has been so for a long long time.  I recommend this camera AFTER they get the issues fixed.UPDATE 09/06/10Instead of updating the 09/05/10 report, I have found somewhat of a solution.  I found that you must format the SDHC card with the GoPro HD(which I was doing) BUT pay attention to the red status light by the lens when the format is complete.  If after the format the red light does NOT blink red three times then the format was successful and the videos won't get corrupted.  In my case, every time I formatted the 32GB SDHC, I got three red blinking lights at the end of the format.  The camera acted like the card was OK by displaying OOO for the video but it would corrupt 100% of the time.  So, in my case, the 32GB SDHC was faulty.  Pay attention to the status lights, this information was not in the manual that I could find.ANOTHER UPDATE :(  10/18/2010  The same problems resurfaced.  I would go out and take awesome videos, the camera acted like everything worked well.  i plug in the camera to the computer via USB and it says \"You must reformat the card\" I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA until GoPro fixes this issue that appears quite common (researching the issue on the internet), extremely frustrating...  YMMV (Your mileage may vary)UPDATE 11/1/2010  GoPro finally sent me a replacement camera and it works fine, I think there is a significant number of defective cameras in the system but they will work with you and eventually send you another one.UPDATE 2/14/11  I thought that the new GoProHD camera sent to me to replace the original defective one was working.  It did for about a month.  Once again, it started corrupting videos and costing me lots of grief.  Imagine if you climbed Mt. McKinley and got to the top, take your \"hero\" pictures, go all the way down, and discover that your camera screwed up, that is the kind of frustration I'm talking about.  The camera hosed me on too many shots like that to put up with anymore.  I'm probably going to take this thing to the shooting range and blow it to pieces.  Buyer beware.++++ ANOTHER UPDATE 5/25/11  LESSONS LEARNED:  I did update the GoProHD to the latest firmware (v01.01.54)  I also tried yet another SD card.  Perhaps the combination of new firmware and the Patriot 16GB Class 6 SDHC did the trick.  I learned that this camera is extremely picky about SD cards.  If you're are having trouble with your video getting corrupted, update the firmware and try another SD card.  Once you get the right card, the corruption issues should stop.  I have been using the camera a lot for two weeks since the new firmware and Patriot 16GB SD card and have had no issues.  I changed my star rating from a one to a three.", "Date": "September 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great, but not underwater!", "Author": "kk72 \"Fatima\"", "ReviewID": "RU20ZN0WJ9C37", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "the good...Great package.

Amazing picture quality. setup menu a little dated.the bad...Was bought for its waterproof qualities in preparation for a Fiji trip. HOWEVER, contrary to what GoPro touts, it is not great for underwater. The reason is the housing curvature over the lense curvature combined with water defraction creates blurry images. this is only found in the GoPro FAQs. very misleading. do an internet search on this. had to buy a special housing with flat lense from eyeofmine.com at $80. Now picture quality underwater is the same as above water. this is where my two stars came from.If you want it for underwater and don't mind buying a new housing for $80, then I recommend, if not, don't buy.If you are using this not for its waterproof qualities, then I recommend.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Doesn't work as expected and flawed design", "Author": "rc", "ReviewID": "R9JE74BDMQXQP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The selling points of this particular camera, for me, are the 720p@60 and 1080p@30 video modes.  The 720p@60 in particular (60 frames per second), is ideally suited for fast action.  It also has the widest field of view.  The 1080p@30 is an interesting alternative, for its higher resolution and less wide field of view.Also critical to my purchasing, was that the battery would last over 2 hours, as I want to record, without intervention -- as that's not practical -- for about that long (up to 2 hours).Unfortunately, I found out that the 720p@60 video mode crashes or stops recording after about 29 minutes!  After spending (wasting) hours of my time, I found out on different forums, that this is a common -- I suspect universal -- problem with this camera. I believe I read it may also be a problem with the other 60 frames per second, lower resolution, mode as well.There's some confusion because there are a _lot_ of complaints about problems with different SDHC cards.  For example, there is one forum thread that lists cards that work (finding one that does is an issue), and others then contradict the list and post that they _don't_ work!In my case, I'm using the SDHC card that is actually recommended and is used by GoPro.  I've systematically tested the 720p@60 and 1080p@30 modes.  The 1080p mode runs till the battery runs out.  The 720p@30 does the same.  But, the 720p@60 consistently crashes at 29 minutes +- a few seconds.  It does so after it begins the 2nd video file.  This is probably a problem with the camera design/firmware.Beyond the above, there is another feature (the ability to select up or upside-down recording) that is supposed to be available in a firmware upgrade.  There are no available firmware upgrades for this camera.  Other's have been waiting and waiting and waiting for GoPro to release an upgrade and it's one of those any-day-now things.  This is Spring and the camera has been out for a good while.  So, who knows when or if there will be such an upgrade.Bottom-line: I recommend to _not_ buy this camera until an actual firmware upgrade is released, and there are reports that it, at least, fixes the 720p@60 video mode recording problem.  This is a POV action camera.  It's a fundamental flaw that it can't record in its optimal video mode for more than 29 minutes without manual intervention.Another complaint... the camera can only be mounted when it is in its water proof housing.  This adds significantly to its weight and bulk (and awkward appearance).  For some uses, the waterproof housing makes sense.  For many other uses -- such as inside a car or cockpit or any non-wet or damaging environment -- it doesn't.  The camera itself, without the housing, is small.  But there's no way to mount it -- it doesn't even have the standard tripod screw opening that other cameras have.  So, I'm scratching my head trying to figure out a way to use the camera without its housing (and protect the lens w/out the housing-- it doesn't even have a lens cap)... yet another problem to be solved.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "MILSPEC to the bone", "Author": "Alexander Wolf", "ReviewID": "R2I4HV673ZZ0T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for use with my flying student to gauge their performance during maneuvers and have a permanent record of what we accomplished during their training.

Koch \"Careful Buyer Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R1QISLXVRZADFK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The GoPro HD videocam is fundamentally a POV helmetcam for bikers, skiers, and boarders.  It offers reasonable HD resolution, wide-angle, with a scan rate up to 60p, which work well for land, air, sailing, or surfing.  For the money, it may merit four or five stars for those uses.My tilt is from the vantage of underwater use, for which the GoPro HD is gol-durned worthless and merits zero stars.Attractions:Here's what drew me to buy:1) The device comes with a waterproof case rated to 180', plus a wide-angle lens, which are intriguing features for a <$300 price.  The elastic head strap mount can be worn above goggles.  One can also buy dessicant strips to avoid fogging.2) Dedicated UW videocams cost plenty, and the best consumer \"rugged\" digicams with HD video (the Panasonic T2 and Olympus 8100) rate only to 30', have LCD screens that are hard to see underwater, and shoot no wider than 28mm, making it hard to frame shots.Realities:I used the GoPro HD while snorkeling and free-diving to about 25'.  The Cozumel waters were among the world's clearest.  Lighting was mixed sun and clouds.  The camera case was dry and clean, and it contained two fresh dessicant strips.  I shot at the 1920x1080 30p setting.  The full HD, I thought, would give me some room for digital zoom when editing, to bring key object to center frame.  I avoided the 1920x720 60p setting, since that is a \"fish-eye\" mode best for very close POV shots, blurs more at the edges, and the faster frame rate superfluous for slow UW action.1) The GoPro HD's video becomes exasperatingly ill-focussed below the surface.  The blur is far worse than my own short-sightedness.  I could see far better without my glasses than could the camera.  Coral formations were all blurry.  Fishes, crabs, and rays appear only as blobs.  People who see YouTube GoPro underwater samples that look tolerable probably saw shots of large objects taken with the standard definition models.  The GoPro HD's underwater video is anything but HD.  It is worse than SD, worse than VHS, worse than MacGoo vision.  GoPro has responded to some owners (but not in its product brochure or manual) that it is \"aware\" of the focus issue, but has yet to offer any optical or firmware corrections.  My problem had nothing to do with condensation, since the case was dry and included fresh dessicant strips sold by GoPro.2) The angle is wide, but not wide enough to alleviate need for careful manual control.  One's tendency is to aim the thing a little too high.  Since there is no preview screen to learn on-location, it would help if the brochure gave buyers some \"heads up\" on the problem.  Essentially, one must set the head strap hinge about 25 degrees downward from the angle of one's forehead, and NOT have the shooting angle match the foreward diretion of one's diving mask.  Alternatively, one should mount the cam on a pole and point it carefully.  If holding it in hand with no pole, be extra careful about diretion, usually aiming below a 45% angle from the water surface.3) No underwater color filters or white balance adjustments.  GoPro sells no adapter filters and no generic or third party models fit.  GoPro could introduce firmware that allows digital white-balance adjustments for blue or green water, but has not replied it will ever do so.Bottom Line:1) People in search of an action or helmet videocamera for land, air, or above-water use should survey the other reviews, plus comments at a user forum.  Most are favorable.  The most common complaints, meanwhile, are that the protective case latch can break and that GoPro failed to deliver a firmware update, without offering any new ETA.  Go Pro's wide-angle and 60p mode offer unique advantages for POV action video ABOVE WATER.  A wide-angle conversion lens alone can cost plenty, and none of this sort exists for other small models.  However, if you can get by with 28mm equivalent wide angle, various \"rugged\" P&S; digicams are more versatile (for stills or video) and have preview screens.  GoPro may soon introduce a preview attachment for its devices, but cost extra and require removing the cam from its protective case.2) Those in search of a device for underwater HD video should explore other manufacturers' models.  Alas, there are few expert reviews that include proper underwater tests.  Do not rely on any reviewers' bathtub tests, home aquarium tests (especially if shot from outside, or samples transcoded or shot with SD models.  In its present configuration, the GoPro HD is entirely unsuitable for scuba, snorkel, or other diving shots.  The earlier SD models yielded more tolerable UW qualty, but anyone in search of HD results, and a $300 budget, might find an underwater enclosure or \"marine pack\" for a P&S; digicam that performs.  Circa $400 will buy the latest and best \"rugged\" digicams with HD video (Panny T2, Oly 8100) rated to 30'.  If one intends to dive frequently, or below 30', greater expenditure for dedicated equipment may be in order.  Otherwise, avoid risk and expense and get a disposable UW still camera.As a general, neutral word of advice, people who intend to EDIT GoPro HD video should have a multi-core PC with a recent dedicated graphics card.  Sony Vegas Pro, FCP, and Pinnacle 12.1 / 14 support the MP4 h.264 files.  Other editing packages may require conversion to another codec before editing.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Great Thing in a Small Package", "Author": "J. Malin \"Google technical writer\"", "ReviewID": "R3V34YRY1GG2AC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The GoPro Hero is everything you need in a casual outdoor video camera. It's the video equivalent of the common pocket digital point-and-shoot, and even better, it has all the fixins' you need to attach it almost anywhere. It's not fancy, so there isn't an endless list of modes and options you have to choose. Basically, you charge it up, turn it on, and start filming.Since I bought it to film on the ski slopes, I chose the \"helmet\" version that comes with a variety of helmet mounts. It took me no more than 10 minutes to set up. The mount fit my helmet almost perfectly and is still solidly attached despite my friends' repeated attempts to knock the whole thing off with the bar on the lift chair. The battery charged in about 5 hours using USB power from a computer. You can buy a dedicated USB charger for it for about $25.The first filming results are great. The picture is clear and well-focused. Even though I was using the waterproof door, I could easily hear sounds close to me. The housing didn't leak at all, and it easily resisted the normal bangs and bumps one gets while skiing.You may have noticed that this camera doesn't come with a SD card. This is a minor downside, but keep in mind that this is the case with nearly all cameras these days. It's actually a plus; you don't get stuck with the manufacturer's choice of SD card. You can buy SD cards in sizes ranging from 2 GB to 32 GB, so you can choose how much space you need and how much you want to pay. It's still cheaper than having to buy film! I bought a top-of-the-line Kingston SD card from Amazon for about $65, which probably gives me more video time than the battery will last!This video camera is an excellent choice for skiing, surfing, mountain biking, and similar sports. Remember that it is *not* (and I emphasize this) for snorkeling or scuba diving. The manufacturer doesn't claim that it is, but don't be fooled into thinking that the waterproof housing means you can take it to the bottom of your pool. I'm an underwater photographer, so I can tell you with assurance that this camera won't hold up to depths of more than about 5 feet. You can spray it with a garden hose or bury it in a foot of snow but that's about it.Also, you should invest in some silica gel packs. You can buy them directly from GoPro, and maybe from other places. They make thin ones that will fit into the waterproof case. They prevent excess moisture from building up inside the housing. Underwater photographers use them all the time. Getting drops of water into the housing is inevitable unless you're in the desert (in which case you get grains of sand), and silica gel will slurp them up quick. This protects both the electronics and the camera case itself.For the money, this is a wonderful toy. It really captures the excitement and experience of skiing. Open up your creative side, too!

This isn't a camera one buys to take pictures of a birthday party. You wear this camera or attach it to anything that moves fast! It is for action videos or pics.I bought it to use skiing and when I ride my bike (HD Road King). There are other options out there that are a tad smaller (though this is quite small) but this one has the quality and price point advantage. They sell TONS of these things so a lot of folks like them. Many top network videos are shot with this cam!I won't get into detail on the settings, others already have. The settings are not hard/compicated to use but they are cumbersome with many steps to get where you want. As already said, you will want to bring the manual sheet along if you think you will be changing things.To keep this short I want to say just a few things. These other reviews cover some of the details quite well and there is no sense in reiterating that. The video stability of this cam is top notch and perhaps it best feature. Skiing downhill while holding a camera or my Harley's vibration is possibly the truest test of video stability. The Go Pro shines here. SO stable it's remarkable. Also, as you have read, the video quality is some of the best you will ever see. The camera likes the outdoors and plenty of light. Low light shooting leaves a little to be desired, though not horrid or anything like that.Exceptional stabilty, great video, lovely WIDE angle lens (slightly fish-eyed on the edges, but who gives a ...), very long battery life!!!

Purchased it anyway and was blown away by the quality of video. Camera is simple to use, but pay close attention to the screen when starting the camera up. While the unit is on the helmet mount it can have the default settings changed and it may not be taking the video you want. My camera default was changed and it took 890 pictures before I realized what was going on. I missed the video but had lots of great photos that I really have no use for, even though it does take great still photos also. I installed a 16GB card which is more memory than the unit will shoot with a full battery charge on 960. I would recommend if you are planning on shooting lots of video without a place to charge, buy the extra battery. Its cheap and great insurance that you won't miss that shot.

The 720p is better than that from my Canon SD940IS, which does not even provide 1080p. There are many sample videos on YouTube from myself and others, just search for the product name.I haven't used the still mode much, but the pictures do not seem nearly as good as that of dedicated still cameras (like the aforementioned camera).I have not tried out the helmet mounts yet, though I did use the included head straps for a couple of videos. These turned out to be nausea-inducing, as I tended to turn my head a lot. I don't think the helmet mounts will be any better, as I would still be turning my head a lot in most sports.I ended up ordering a GoPro Chest Mount Harness for HERO Cameras and the videos from that were much more stable.I thought I would be using the 1080p mode a lot, but for the coxing videos I have been using this for so far the 720p wide-angle mode is much more suitable, you can see much more of the boat and the oars; also, at 60fps slow motion video would be much clearer.The choice they made to leave out a display paid off in battery life - 2.5 hours of continuous on time is awesome! The control mechanism is fairly unfriendly, but you get used to it... not sure why they couldn't have put in a mode dial though, it wouldn't have been that much more expensive, even for the waterproof case part - Canon cameras have had this in their waterproof cases for many years.I didn't even think about the sound, but after reading the product literature I have to say I agree with their comments about sound quality. Looking back over some other videos taken with still and video cameras I find that there is a lot of wind noise in most of them, whereas this camera in its waterproof case lets you hear ambient noise without the wind noise.All in all, a great product.

I decided to get the devices ready by attempting to download the GoPro software...what a pain in the rear-end...I attempted to copy all the files to my camera's SD card at the root folder, I received the following error message: \"The disk in drive E is not formatted. Do you want to format it now? Yes or No. When I say Yes, to format removable disk E, it states \"Windows was unable to complete the format.\"When I attempted to copy all the files to my camera's SD card at the root folder, I received the following error message: \"The disk in drive E is not formatted.

Well there's 22 minutes of my life I'll never get back. This is unacceptable and extremely poor customer service.  So, I then called their customer service and they told me their tech support should have remained opened for another 2 hours.  The customer service rep. was unable to put me in the front of the waiting line to their tech support, so I again waited...and waited...and waited; so, after about an hour I got fed-up and hung up.I went to the GoPro web site to contact them about my issue with downloading the software and their poor customer service.  I sent them the following inquiry request: I have found your system-GoPro Hero 3: Silver Edition and Black Edition extremely difficult to download. My issue/problem with copying the update to my SD root has not been resolved since I have called technical support last week and my attempt to reach someone several times.According to their web site, my inquiry will take approximately 3-4 days to get a response...Hummm 13 days later, I finally got a response, but by then I was so fed up with GoPro and I decided to return both the Silver and Black edition...It's just not worth all the frustration.  I wasted several hours of my life trying to deal with their technical support and them failing to solve the issue with downloading their software.Like I said in the beginning...Due to Gopro's extremely poor customer service, I have returned both the Silver and Black edition...GoPro really need to work on their customer service.

Sterling", "ReviewID": "R3K4LF1X5RTX3S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "GOPro Motorsorts Hero HD - Wow...  who would have thought such a little camera could be so cool? I got the Hero HD for a few uses... mainly on my boat for recording fishing trips for friends and family, but also for other fun activities like an upcoming vacation with lots of scuba diving planned. The first tests were pretty impressive. The main reason I got the camera was for the ultra wide angle lens, since I've tried other cameras and the close quarters on the rear deck of the boat made it hard to record everything. With the Hero HD's ability to record either at 127 degrees wide angle (1080p mode) or at 170 degrees(!) (720 or 960p) I can now record the entire rear deck without losing anything. The video quality is impressive to say the least. Everything seems to be spot on - color, brightness, and so on. Granted, I'm not a videophile, but rather just an average user - but either way the quality is very much to my liking. The 720 and 960 modes have some serious curvature due to the extreme wide angle, but in the 1080p mode it is not very noticeable, even though it's 127 degrees.The sound captured with this camera actually surprised me. There is a second door option included for the waterproof housing - one for being waterproof (solid) and a second you can put on in pace of the waterproof door that is NOT waterproof, as it has openings in it. This allows for better sound capture, and it works. Voices are clear, even if 10-15ft away, and the quality is good. We were trolling for salmon and had a sea otter slide by us and you can hear the chatter it made, even at 25ft away and with normal boat noise, water splashing and our voices.Setting up the camera is a little clumsy the first few times you do it... it is not the easiest thing. Once you change settings a few times it gets easier. The waterproof housing (go to 170ft!) is tight and feels strong - I'll be testing the waterproof feature this winter in Hawaii. Plus I have some ideas for the boat next summer as well...Be sure to check compatibility of the SDHC card...  user forums report a number of issues with cards that do not function in the Hero HD. I'm using a Patriot Class4 32GB card with no problems at all. One thing I learned on the forums was to format the card IN THE CAMERA before use.My biggest gripe with the camera has to do with the suction cup mount. I bought the motorsports version as that was the mount I needed. Sadly, the mount is limited. If you want to shoot directly forward of the mount, there is no problem. However, the mount has no rotational ability! There are extra pieces to turn it 90 degrees, but if you need to angle it a few degrees from center then you are out of luck. Instead, I would suggest something like this Delkin Devices DDMOUNT-SUCTION Fat Gecko Double Knuckle Dual Suction Cup Camera Mount. I had one of these and I'm glad I did  - I just got the tripod adapter for the GoPro (GoPro Tripod Mount for HERO Cameras)and now I have full 360 degree movement.  Had I known, I would have gotten JUST the camera, and no mounting options, and saved a few dollars.Another drawback is there is no LCD viewfinder. Not surprising since the camera is designed for helmet cam use and so on. It's not designed to be hand held as much. However, there is a LCD addon backpak type unit for it coming out this fall (2010) that I'm looking forward to trying. Also a extra battery packpak too.Videos are recorded in MP4 format and so far I've encountered no problems with editing, in both Windows Movie Maker and more recently I started using Sony's Movie Studio HD.Overall I am VERY happy with my purchase... it will provide a lot more fun videos of friends and family on my boat, as well as vacation stuff.***UPDATE!I was sorely disappointed in this camera for underwater filming **UNTIL** I foundout about a fix. The original housing will NOT take good underwater photos. Google \"GoPro Flat Lens Fix\" and you'll find posts about how the lens does not focus correctly underwater. The very first day of our vacation in Hawaii, I ran straight out of the condo to the beach with the camera and jumped in to go snorkeling. When I returned to the condo, and plugged in the footage I was like \"WTF?!?\" why is this so crappy. I'm used to the sharp, colorful, in focus video this thing normally did. So I hopped on Google, and lo and behold there I found the problem. The lens is not setup for the difference the water makes to the focal length. I found a few sites that detailed how to make your own 'flat lens fix' to correct everything (Look on YouTube and you'll see a bunch of videos showing the before and after fix videos). But I was in Hawaii. Poipu Beach. I had a dives set up starting in 2 days!!! I had no idea where to grab stuff, I needed some specific items, and had no idea where to get them as I had just got on the island. Grrrrr!!!  BUT...I ran across one site, eyeofmine.com, and they actually sold a corrected GoPro housing. They took the original housing and made the flat lens fix onto them, and then pressure test them to 100 or 200ft depending on which one you want. I was able to get ahold of them on a SUNDAY, and had a housing sent to me next day air to my condo. And I can tell you, it WORKS. GO to my YouTube page and see for yourself - [...]Granted, I'm a little PO'd I had to spend more $$$ on a housing that should have been working right in the first place.

Personally, I use it for auto racing, snorkling, mountain biking, ski/snowboarding, etc.  The Hero does all of that great, but the video quality is poor.  My first impression after using it for only a few days was that low light, dynamic range, sharpness, all left a lot to be desired.  Not to mention the usability of the setup menus, which many people have complained about here.  I would equate the quality to a $50 digital camera.So I bought a Hero2 to compare.  The difference is night and day.  Colors are MUCH better, low light is MUCH better, WDR/HDR is MUCH better.  Menus are MUCH better.  The Hero2 is 50% more expensive, but easily 4 times better.  If you want to compare and decide for yourself, go to youtube, and search for \"hero vs hero2\".  There are some good side by side reviews, but I though the difference was even greater than what I could gather from those reviews.My recommendation: unless you are exclusively filming in bright light, and don't care much about video quality, stretch your budget a bit and go for the Hero2.

Well, it's all due to their stupid instructions, but once you find the way to reset it, it's no big deal. I spent an hour trying to figure out how to do it.The 'menu' system is idiotic.All these three letter/number codes and then you have to look up in the instructions sheet what they mean. I understand they tried to make some sort of codes that makes sense, but trust me, you won't remember it. There are too many of them.

I bought this for my new paintball business and have ended up using it for many things. I have attached it to dune buggies, taken it deep sea fishing, snorkeling, on roller coasters and skydiving. The gopro has allowed me to capture all these events and share them. If you are looking for a general camcorder to capture everything then this is probably not the camera for you. With the lack of zoom and lcd display it makes it difficult to use this as an everyday camcorder unless you carry your computer with you everywhere or buy the lcd attachment.

It has a wide angle so you see not only the snow ahead but the horizon and view beyond the skier. I was advised by a friend to get a camera with a wide angle lens and am very happy I did.It is extremely sturdy and comes with a couple of different ways to mount it. I put the strap on my helmet so that we could switch off between the adhesive mount on my daughter's helmet and mine. Switching it is simple. It also attaches securely to the mounts. My only caution is that it is possible to fall hard enough to have the mount detach from the helmet.

Everyone I talked to liked them, and with a sub $300 price I figured it was worth a try. I installed it with the roll bar attachment option for a resent track day at Laguna Seca, and was very impressed by the picture quality. Set at 720p / 60fps, the video looked pretty darn close to in-car footage you see on a TV broadcast. The wide-angle lens showed the actions of the driver clearly as well as a nice view of the track. Colors are sharp and accurate, and the auto-focus worked very well. It's pretty easy to use once you get acustom to the simple two button operation with tiny LCD screen that only shows the settings. The case and mounting seem very sturdy, and battery life has been very good. If you purchase a 32gb card you'll have plenty of storage for a whole day at the track. My only two issues are that when you turn the unit back on to start a track session, you need to re-set the video settings to where you want it - it should just default to whatever your last setting was. Also, aiming the camera is a bit of a challenge since there is no viewfinder or LCD picture display. You kind of just point it straight out toward the windshield and hope for the best. Luckily with the wide angle lens, you would have to be pretty far out of line to not get a good viewing area. Personally, I'd give up a little size and pay an extra $50 for a small LCD screen on back for aiming.

It's surprisingly small (especially without the case), and light enough to be ignored in a lot of applications. I've used this while tubing behind a boat, water skiing and airchairing, jet skiing, shooting handguns/shotguns/rifles, SCUBA diving, hiking, swimming, cliff diving, traversing slot canyons, racing around the Nurburgring, and many other things. This camera is so flexible, it can go just about anywhere. There are purchasable options to secure the GoPro to just about anything, from headbands and helmets, to suction cups and roll cage attachments.The quality of the video is amazing for such a small camera. As my mom said when she first saw it, \"It's like watching HDTV.\" Um, yeah. The 1080p video is spectacular. Color depth is fantastic, sharpness is great. The 5MP photos are adequate, and can be useful if being edited into a video, but not so much as a \"high quality\" still. I've never used 960p or 480p, so I can't speak for those, but 720p is also useful, for a couple reasons: 90% of the time, when I use 720p, I use 60FPS to get all the gritty detail for some good slow-mo footage, but there were a few times I've used 720p purely for it's 170-degree view. For really intense action sports, the wide angle gives you a much better view, and a more stable image. It's also nice using 720p along with the helmet cam, because it gives a close approximation of what the person's field of view actually is.It's got to be good, because national television networks are using the camera for regular footage! If you watch Discovery, History Channel, or MTV even a little, you will catch shots of the the GoPro all over the place, including shows like Mythbusters, One Man Army, and Nitro Circus. Professionals like Travis Pastrana and Tanner Foust use GoPros all the time to catch their stunts and showcase their equipment and teams.The problem I usually end up having is getting stuff on the lens of the waterproof case. I've had bug splatter, water spots, and saltwater residue; and flying rocks or just getting too friendly with abrasive objects have scratched the lens. Luckily some RainX helps prevent water spots, and lens replacements are cheap, and easy to replace. The problem is, I usually don't know until the end, or when I'm editing the video, that the lens was obscured.Things I wished were on this camera: an option to zoom in and out (independent of the resolution), option for a narrower field of view (more zoom), even higher frame rates, higher resolution stills, better low light capability, microphone input, and HDMI. Well, guess what. Only a few months after I got my HD Hero, the significantly improved HD Hero 2 is now out. And, it has ALL the things in my wish list! So what's a man to do? I guess owning 2 GoPros should have also been on my wish list.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good but not Perfect!

I ordered it with a couple of extra batteries, the LCD BacPac and a 32GB SD card. Out of the box, be sure to insert the SD card into your PC and format it.  Go to GoPro's website and download the firmware update to the SD card if applicable. Fully insert the card into the GoPro. Follow the directions included with the camera to upload the update from the SD card to the camera. If you follow these steps, subsequent use of the camera is simple. I set the video resolution to 1080p and I'm pretty pleased with the quality of the recordings. The only reason I haven't given the camera 5 stars (as of the moment) is that the audio quality is extremely poor. I'll update my review as I use the camera. So far so good!Update 12/5/11After a few days of using the camera I realized I needed more than the 1 hour and 45 minutes of recording time that I was getting. I wasn't in a position to change the batteries, so I ordered the BacPac battery. There was an issue with the second battery working properly in the BacPac. I e-mailed customer service and the response from GoPro was excellent. They promptly replaced the defective part and shipped it back to me in a reasonable amount of time.I've now used the camera for a significant number of hours. The picture quality is outstanding for the price. The audio quality is acceptable - all things considered.I am very satisfied with the product. Please know that this camera is not for videoing your child's basketball games, birthday parties, weddings, or similar activities. You'll need to purchase something like the Sony HDR-CX160 for these types of activities (I have one of these Sonys - a different camera for different \"missions\"). The GoPro camera is specifically made for cycling, snowboarding, sky diving, motorcycles, auto racing, aviation cockpit recordings, and other similar applications.

Thanks GoPro!", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worth the Investment!", "Author": "FrontPage", "ReviewID": "R3D14BU333BMR2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I saw the use of this little gem when I had to shoot ad-carrying airplanes on the eastern shore. Their company turned me onto the HD Hero camera and with the price being less than $400, I took the footage from their camera, showed it to my boss, and he ordered us two cameras.We cover motor sports, biking, and water events (both above and below, sometimes) and the GoPro HD is worth it. Because it helps you keep shooting. It had been frustrating to cover water based events, because we would have to shoot from the shore. But people are willing to mount this camera (or wear it) to give a POV perspective, albeit in fisheye. The fisheye view is never overplayed because we don't use it too often. When we need to, we welcome the fact that someone has made a camera that can shoot in WVGA, HD (720p, 960p in 4:3 aspect, as well as 1080p), will shoot in NTSC as well as PAL, and also can shoot stills and even act as a time lapse camera from 1 frame per second, to one every minute. This versatility is what people crave. But this camera even shoots in different frame rates from 30p to 60p which allows for slow motion. Put the footage into Motion or Final Cut Pro and you can tweak it to a super slow motion clip that looks great.It's small enough to fit a gynormous number of places, and the manufacturers seem intent on expanding the accessories which is a major plus for anyone interested in a GoPro. I just got the LCD screen which allows me to frame the camera better. The screen is powered by the battery but you can turn it on for framing and then turn it off since the LCD has its own power button (which is incorporated into a host of expanded rear covers). Add all of this, as well as the host of mounts for all different types of applications, and what should stop anyone interested in getting unique POV's from investing in this system? If you want to hate on it, that's your choice. But try putting any expensive camera where these go, and you stand a good chance of eventually destroying your camera. I was amazed at some footage of a Formula car crash shot with a GoPro - the car flipped about 5 times or so and the camera didn't miss a beat. I see that even shows like MythBusters use them. I'm only happy that they don't charge an arm and leg to buy these. A 32GB SD card might cost half of the camera's price.Battery life is great, the sound quality is decent (not the best by any means but what do you expect with a device that small?) and the image quality is fine for the price. I see noise artifacts and degradation in image quality because it compresses alot (the video is shot in MP4) but I just can't be unhappy with GoPro because it delivers where and when we need.An important thing to know is that the GoPro wasn't designed as an underwater camera - even though it has a waterproof housing - that is for things like surfing and other water sports. I was dismayed myself upon seeing blurry underwater photos when I first used it. The stock housing isn't designed to make this an underwater camera  - but a *waterproof* camera. The lens on the casing is convex in order for water drops to better move away for the camera's shooting. What's neat is that there's an underwater flat lens housing that keeps the image sharp both above and below water. Because the glass in front of the lens is flat, you'll probably get droplets sticking to it, but I read that using some Rain-X helps. I've tried to be fair while I'm obviously a GoPro fan, because it makes my job easier. Even with the compression issues I still rank this as a must-have in the image and filmmaking arsenal.", "Date": "May 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "T.

The sound can be limited when you use the water proof case.  That isn't a negative, just a reality since you are trying to get sound through a sealed housing.  I recently took the camera on a 100+ mile MT bike trip to Canyonlands NP on the White Rim Trail.  The camera has multiple settings for video quality.  I used the 960P setting in stead of the 1080p because you get a little wider angle view with the 960 setting.  The video quality is amazing with this camera.  I mounted the camera on my helmut.  Even though the trail is rough the video is fairly smooth.  One negative is the helmut mount clip.  When mounting the camera to the helmut clip I found some excessive clearance between the mating parts.  I just used some duct tape to take up the gap.  With out fixing the gap issue the camera wiggled enough that it caused some video \"bounce\".  The issue was easily fixed with engineered duct tape.  The other mounts seem to be tight, maybe it was just a bad part.  I ended up buying the LCD back for the camera so I could see what I was recording before taking alot of bad shots.  The LCD back is really a must for the camera when you are out away from your computer for a few days, otherwise you can't look at the shots.  It would be a great product improvement to incorporate a LCD back in to the camera.  If you are considering buying the camera look closely at the package to verify what you are getting: selection of mounts etc.  I did't get the helmut mount in the package I bought so I had to buy it seperatly.  I also would recommend buying the 32Gb SD card, perhaps 2 so you have lots of storage media if you take lots of video.  Also, get a spare battery for long trips.

The 60 frames per second (fps) option is awesome for slow motion videos. I even took this the the driving range and watched my golf swing in slow motion with this. Its extremely helpful for golf so you can work on fine tuning your swing.The only thing that I'm worried about is losing this camera. No matter what mount you put on it, it will still sink. even with no mount, it sinks. I can't come up with a way to make it float so If it falls off in big surf I hope the leash will buy you enough time to grab it before its done for.The pictures on amazon are also pretty decieving. The camera isnt white at all. Its aluminum or something thats silver.The camera also has an unbelievably cool fish eye effect.

Just don't expect fully featured 1080p camcorder type quality, it's definitely usable.  The sound is pretty awful.  My camera vibrated terribly inside the plastic case.  After I stuffed paper towels inside to cushion it, the vibration noise went away and made the sound merely bad, as opposed to Mute awful.Now to the downside.  I mounted this in a car during a race.  Worked really well day 1.  Unfortunately every single video from day 2 is unwatchable.  Somehow the files got corrupted.  There was no indication of a problem race day.  The file sizes look normal.  I have no idea how it happened, but losing 6+ hours of race day video is completely unacceptable.  After doing some research this seems to be somewhat common.  Typically it appears to happen when there is some kind of impact(which is understandable) but in my case there was no such impact.

Without really mastering the menus, I was ready to test it out. I was able to record some very nice quality videos in HD of course and was very pleased with the results. The package is top quality as are the included accessories and instructions and my purchase from Amazon was hassle free and got here a few days after I placed my order. The camera seems to be quite rugged and is amazingly small and lightweight. With the files it creates you can play right away on your PC without any conversion hassle or extra software, so that part is super.  Don't really have much complaints or that is below expectations - just that its made in China.  Its about as simple to use as a Kodak Instamatic but about a jillion times better.As far as \"nice to haves\" would be a viewfinder - it does not have one. That would no doubt add cost, increase space and eat more battery power though, so its a small trade off. You'll need to experiment with the best orientation from trail and error - record some, not the positioning, pop the card out, view it on your pc, then adjust if you need. The lens is very good and the mounts held up very well on my 4 cyl Kawasaki which can vibrate some at certain rpms. There are ways to have a remote monitor (and power) connected but I have not tested. It has a lot of features I have not yet used and I have not played much with low light or the other included case. Daylight performance was very good. The battery as shipped came charged so you can play right away. After a few trials, I did a full charge then filled my 4GB card up shooting 4 or 5 vids. It's better to take many smaller clips, then put together rather than one big long run and operating the controls on my motorcycle, wearing a full face helmet and heavy leather gloves was not that easy but not impossible.  It was a bit hard to tell when it was on or off since you need to look at the front of the camera and that's hard and dangerous on a moving bike.  A little practice memorizing the sequence and button pushing should do the trick.  It does have an indicator and sound beeps, both of  which can be customized. I could not hear the beeps with my helmet and earplugs on.You can see some of my test vids on You Tube - look up user account Robert8455.

Yes a GoPro has been lost in the ocean for months and been recovered intact with complete recorded footage. Despite these success stories, (or maybe because of them), many people end up breaking their GoPros. These cameras don't just shrug off blows. Sure, they'll take serious punishment, but like anything, treat them with care and you'll be rewarded, neglect them, and they'll break.Speaking of break, let's break down the GoPro HD Hero Naked in this complete review:Tips: Some important things I've learned as a GoPro filmer-Stick with the basics. The HD Hero Naked is cheap, very similar to the newer HD Hero 3's and less risk monetarily for just as much fun.-Don't expect cinema quality your first go-around. The HD Hero records in a funky fisheye lens aspect. It is very recognizable but lacks the well-known cinemaesque feel to it.-Separate purchases are HIGHLY recommended. It's called Naked for a reason. Accessories related to the type of filming planned are recommended. Suction cup mounts for surfing, sticky mounts for mountain biking, pole mounts for skiing/snowboarding, etc.Pros/Cons:Pros:-Like the brand says, 'World's Most Versatile Camera\".-Battery life is superb if rationed correctly. 7 hours can be expected at times from a single charge.-Takes standard SD. Much more convient to the camera that take micro-SD or some other obscure data storage medium-Different settings for different recordings. 1080p 30fps for regular shots, 720p 60fps for high speed shots, etc.Cons:-Low-Tech Interface. Frustrating menu navigation, buttons are a pain to push with the housing on.-No zoom. Like, at all...- Not very streamlined. It seems to take up the maximum amount of space for the given volume it possesses.-Sound. Not much of an issue, but the quality is borderline horrendous. (Just put music over it)Overall, this camera will allow you to capture the things you always deemed to risky to record on a regular camera. The \"cool guy\" is always the guy with GoPro footage to share. Its humbly priced compared to it's bigger brothers, but is still quite a hefty buy in it's own rights.

With the accompanying cases, its waterproof.  This camera is perfect for any kind of action sport.keep this in mind:  The lens fogs up easily when used with the waterproof case and the camera will heat up and cause it to shut down.  You can purchase the  high dollar antifog\" inserts or just put a piece of chamis or a small bandaid inside the case. All will absorb the moisture.You can also buy the skeleton case which has openings on the sides for cables. The camera won't fog in this case, but again, the camera is not waterproof.Make sure your finger does not cover the small  on the  camera. You will muffle out the audio if you do that.If you program it for wide angle, keep those fingers on the body of the camera behind the lens otherwise you fingers will be captured in the framing.CONS:footage can be shaky even if you are just standing still. Static shooting is not what this camera is for. If you are looking to use it for beautiful wide screen landscapes, forget it. It's best for action shots. Monopod or makeshift steady cams will reduce the shaky cam look a little.No external audio input. Only an on board audio mic.

LCD is great, it will suck the life out of the camera.Go Pro has a variety of pkgs, but you might as well purchase the naked and the accessory kit that has everything-mounts, cases, extra screws and adapters.If you have the funds, I would recommend purchasing the following.Extra batteries!! You will lose a battery if you are shooting in rugged conditions.  Battery life is not 2.5 hours. it's more like and 1-1.5replacement lens kit-lens on the case gets easily scratchedHarness-all of them, chest and helmet. warning about the chest harness. unless you have the LCD to frame your shots, you might want to make sure you lock the camera in place with an up angle. You will end up with torso shots (or change your view to 960).UPDATE:  Go to this website-they have all the tips, tricks and Go PRo workarounds you need. [...]If audio is necessary in chest harness shots, keep in mind the camera will pick up the heartbeat and breathing of your photographer.monopod- this is fantastic to use.Get one with a ball mount so you can use the monopod as an extender arm.  Keep in mind the monopods do not have the correct mount for the go pro case. You will have to purchase the adapter from GO Pro for $8.  I did and it did not come with a bolt or nut. I went to Home Depot and got a set and it works great.LCD goes without saying.back up memory cards. class 4 and higher at least 16GB.external hard drive-dump your footage onto the ext hard drive. Once you lose it, it's lost forever. The files size is huge which is a good reason not to store it on your computer.BTW this codec works fine with mac. never have had problems importing.UPDATE:  If you are using FCP software, save yourself the headache of rendering every single time.

It's relatively simple to use, expandable by adding a battery pack or video screen, ruggedly protected in a waterproof case, and small and light enough to be mounted anywhere,  and shoots in HD.  When framing your shots, you need to be mindful of the fact that the lens makes objects appear to be farther away than they really are (much like the effect a \"fisheye\" lens has).  I did not take this into account when I bought it and I was caught off guard when I downloaded my first footage.  Plan on everything farther than 4 four feet away from the camera appearing to be much farther away than they really are.

Upon opening the package, I was very excited. The waterproof casing, mounts, and devices all seemed exceptionally solid and well designed. The box included two sets of instructions: one for the camera operation (in multiple languages) and one for mounting tips. The mounting tips instructions were remarkably inadequate. I spent an hour trying to figure out what all the pieces were for and how to figure out the helmet strap (before realizing the strap only works for vented bicycle helmets).So after fumbling with it to figure out a mounting strategy for my snowboarding helmet, I attempted to use the camera a bit to set up the pointing. The camera simply would not recognize a few of my SD cards. I thought the cards might have been defective as I had bought them from an Amazon seller not too long ago but I loaded them into my Olympus and they worked just fine. So once I found an SD card the camera would actually recognize, I tried to do some initial filming and the camera just beeped. I spent another hour troubleshooting this using the inadequate camera operation instructions which no where seemed to talk of an issue with three beeps. Anyway, I finally decided to just give up and return it and requested a refund rather than a replacement.My overall impression was that the mounts and case equipment were awesome, but the glitchy camera hardly seems worth $300, even though I can't really speak to that since I couldn't get it to shoot anything. In the end I think I'd rather just get a Flip or other cheaper HD camera and Jerry-rig my own mounts and cases (or even just continue hand held shooting).

It worked well and I used it a few times (under 10) and had no issues. I just came back from vacation where I went zip lining and it was probably the first time I actually had something good to record. Recorded 2 videos and everything was going great. On the third video, I noticed that the red recording light wasn't blinking and it was stuck on. None of the buttons were responding so I had to yank the battery out. The camera would not turn on after I put the battery back in. The battery was fully charged and I only recorded 15 minutes tops before it froze and would not turn on. Came home frustrated that I missed out on the whole day's worth of activities, I plugged the camera into the charger. The red light came on and it was charging like normal. Once the light turned off, I tried to turn the camera on but again, would not turn on.This is extremely disappointing that the camera suddenly stopped working out of thin air. I'm still playing with it, trying to turn it on but it's not working. I was using the unit with the waterproof housing, so I am certain it's not water damage. I started researching and saw a lot of problems similar to mine. This is a great camera when it works, but I don't think I'll buy another one knowing that it might just decide to stop working one day.

I love photography and want to try my skills underwater.. However, the housing for my DSLR costs around $ 3K so I opted for the GoPro HD (not the latest one) mainly because of the following:1. Price (the latest model is more than double the price of this one)2. I wanted to know if this camera will actually deliver underwater as per the expectations, before I invest a lot of money into it3. I figured that if I have full HD video (1080p at 30fps) then I can pretty much take frame freeze captures and turn them into still photos...so I compromised on the still photo resolution (which is 5MP for this camera)I must say that I am pretty impressed with the product. The following are the reasons:Pros:1. Extremely small form factor makes it easy to be mounted or carried in extreme sports (in my case deep diving)2. Camera itself is rubberized so that little accidental exposure to water does not break it3. Comes with a housing that is water proof up to 180' (which satisfies most deep diving needs)4. Has a very wide angle which is critical for underwater diving (one of the reasons for a 5 star)5. Captures slow motion video using 60fpsCons:1. Settings and menu takes some time to get used to as its a small screen and choice based system (but I can understand why it is this way, as incorporating a big display would have made it more bulky and would have increased the price)2. Could have included a batter charger (currently only has the USB cable which you use to charge as well as transfer photos videos to your laptop)Overall I recommend this camera for almost any outdoor sport... just remember that in low light conditions such as underwater, no matter what the camera, you will need a separate artificial light source for your pictures to come out good.

I haven't had a chance to go boarding or kayaking with it yet, but I got a few uses out of it so far. I have some bike ride, dog walking and some rabbit video that I need to edit to edit some nice videos out of.The outdoor video is amazing. This camera is worth its price for so many reasons. Ive paid almost this much for an underwater housing before.Wide angle view is awesome. You can get the whole action. Camera rotations don't make people as dizzy. A wide angle lens for a camera can cost you way more than this whole device.There are numerous mounting options depending on what you want to do with it. My favorite mounting so far is the tripod mount attached to a mono-pod. (This gives you the ability to record high or low angles easily. Basically a pole-cam)Cons:So far It seems to do a great job in the daylight. Get near dusk or indoors in normal room lighting the video does not look so good. I tried to record a motor swap tutorial for the AR.Drone with my hero sitting in my living room with the lights on, and the end result is basically a barely visible dark mess. This might be the biggest reason for me to get the HD Hero 2.Differences:Based on my research it seems the following are the main differences (This first set are the ones that matter to me). I ordered the Hero2 for personal comparison.-Low light capability. HD Hero is basically for outdoors use during the day (also white balance seems to be improved.-Independent resolution and viewing angle. HD Hero has fixed resolution and angle combinations-Wifi BacPac streaming. February 2012 will bring a streaming BacPac that will let you stream video and control the camera from comp or smart phone.-10 (11mp) pictures in one second burst. (Great for making sure you get that action still.)Other differences that aren't worth the upgrade to me:-11mp sensor. (OK so this sensor is probably responsible for the low light ability, but the pixel count doesn't matter that much when you're using it for video.)-Easier to read front display. There are list of modes in the back, and you can learn to read the codes. (ie. UPd means upside down)Summary:So basically if you want something to record awesome outdoor video for a good price the HD Hero is the way to go. I don't think anyone will be dissatisfied with the camera for this use. If you want any of the extra features or better video quality, it seems its best to pay a little more to get the HD Hero 2.Look on YouTube for comparison videos, and there are several good examples.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Handy and fun", "Author": "S_ditty", "ReviewID": "R3JNWYHJH3L77C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far the GoPro has been easy enough to capture video on, the still pictures are not very good, but considering the resolution it'll work.

It's a great camera and delivers great video which is what I mainly bought it for. I really want to give it a perfect score but find that to be difficult. The audio quality is horrible. I can barely hear the engine on my car or anything else that is worth recording. Just wear a pair of those little spongy ear plugs and watch TV. Wht you hear is how the recording from this camera sounds like. I have to give credit where it's due the video quality is amazing for such a little device. There are various modes to choose from with the best being the full HD 1080P recording. Be warned that recording at this setting takes up a lot of space. A 20 minute track session can take 2+GB of space.I'm going to summarize the pros and cons below to help others decide if this is the right camera for them:Pros:1. Awesome wide angle video2. Great wide angle photos3. Multiple mounting options4. Plenty of accessories5. Very rugged6. Water proof7. 32 gb sd card capacity8. Great time laps photo mode. (This was a pleasant surprise)9. Great value for the moneyCons:1. Audio is not that great2. Menu is a bit hard to use the first few times3. No LCD view finder (can be purchased separately as an add-on)4. No external mic jack5. can't take pictures/video while the usb charger is plugged into the computer6. Underwater recording requires a replacement lens that is flat not convex (extra purchase)7. No remote control to turn the camera on/off or to snap random imagesConclusion:If you want an awesome camera to capture all of your adventures with great quality images and video then this is the camera for you. Its super easy to carry and rugged. Some may complain that there is no external viewfinder and that the audio quality is not hi-fi. They are able to deliver this awesome package by obviously skipping on some of these features while maintaining their aggressive price point. My main wish is that it had an external mic jack so that i could place the mic in the car away from the wind so that it can pick up good sound.

It's also water-resistant, as demonstrated by its inverted submersion in a mud puddle after one of the truck wrecks.Setup and use of the camera is fairly easy, but some of the settings are difficult due to the tiny icons on the tiny LCD. I'd also like to find a flatter lens so there is less fisheye distortion. I guess my only real complaint is that the camera is surprizingly heavy for its size (still only a few grams, though).

I like the camera a lot, but if you're a bit shy on the tech end, the instructions will need to be reviewed a few times to get you going. They could make them a bit more \"user-frinedly\". The included suction mount is functional, but after seeing a few reviews on the RAM flexible mount, you'll want to invest in one of those after trying the GoPro mount for a few weeks, especially if you need to mount the camera at odd windshield angles. Trust me. The optional rear-video screen (LCD bacpac) makes changing settings a lot easier for the less tech savvy, but if you go and check out the tons of YouTube or blog reviews and \"How-To's\" BEFORE you need to use the camera, you'll be fine. I did a fair amount of looking a GoPro tips websites and that helped a lot.For shooting and editing, practice makes perfect, and I use a Mac so I'm well versed in manipulating the files on that OS. Can't say if its easier or harder for a Windows user. I do wish GoPro would make an application for both platforms that could render the files with minimal fuss....but hardware seems to be there strong point, so its not a big deal for me. I bought both the optional Battery backpac and LCD backpac. Pricey, but a good investment. I have an older unused and padded camera bag that will do very nicely for storing it when not in use. For full day drives, you may need to run a AC adapter to the unit, so you need to think of buying a skeleton case with the holes open on the side (just to let you know), or rig up a setup without a back cover but use some HD rubber bands to keep the unit secure in the front portion of the housing.Get a good SDHC card.

The 1080p video format is the biggest selling point. The image quality is quite nice in daylight. The colors look pretty good and fairly good saturation. The footage captured from a helmet cam is shakier than what you see on the web site. They must have smoothcam'd it in post to get it more steady (a disclaimer is probably necessary). In even the slightest low lighting situations and indoors, the video quality is VERY grainy and much darker than it appears in real life. That's a disappointment. Underwater the light has to be really good as well. I wasn't impressed with it underwater, but using it on a surfboard with splashing and dips under is still cool. The driving test I did came out pretty well. You have to be sensitive to how the camera is going to react to the lighting situation and compose your frame accordingly. Too much sky and everything else on the ground will be dark.CAVEAT: If you want your video smooth, you have to expect to smoothcam it in post with FinalCut or something.So, bottom line for me is that it's useful for biking, walking, driving, time lapse and all that, as long as it's in daylight. Having something that captures 1080p video on bike, car and such makes it a useful addition to my video work.

I use it mainly for wakeboarding and dirt biking, it lasts probably for about two minutes wakeboarding before snapping off and sinking.  The only thing that has kept my last one from the depths of the lake is a piece of pool noodle duct taped to the camera, because the leash they provide snaps off or bends the hinge pin.  For dirt biking you should avoid trees because you'll get to a stopping point take your helmet off only to realize you have no camera anymore. The mounts are crap, the housing is crap, camera is pretty cool, but mounting it in an action sport world just doesn't work, unless you want to spend all your time buying new mounts, cases, and possibly new cameras if it sinks as I had to do.Very disappointing product....", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Reliable, small, light!", "Author": "echo delta", "ReviewID": "RQ0W3J8ZH3LYJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Used a GoProHD for a High Altitude Balloon Project. The little camera was sent up to 100.000 feet with no encasing (didn't want to risk fogging) and exposed to temperatures of -60\u00baC (-75F). It performed well and the video and audio quality was incredible.We extended the battery life extracting wires from the case battery connectors and rigging the camera to 2 external NB-5L Canon Li-Ion 3.7v 1100 mAH batteries installed in parallel. We got an incredible 21GB of 720p/60 fps video , 2 hours 40m long.

Kingston 32 GB Class 4 SDHC Flash Memory Card SD4/32GB.My only wishes for this camera are:1) a better UI for the menu -  I don't want a color LCD, extra buttons, or anything that would add weight or reduce the ruggedness of the camera, but the menu system is extremely slow AND laggy and thus hard to navigate. I hope the GoPro folks rethink the menu design in future versions.2) a video mode or lens exchange system to make it less of a fisheye and thus be able to take pictures at with less barrel distortion.

The fishbowl lens is a real minus if there is any up & down movement; less so if you're moving side to side & maintaining a fairly constant horizon in the center of your frame. Many manufacturers have the wide-angle fishbowl lens but GoPro's really distorts the image in a bad way. The overall video quality doesn't impress me, it's just OK.If you wear a head harness while rock climbing (H.H. is not available with the motorsports package -- but available), you will probably end up with annoying video. If you wear a head harness while driving, you'll be happier with the results because your focus doesn't change as often. Sometimes what you're shooting makes all the difference, or what resolution you choose, or how well the image is illuminated. While you'll get better at compensating for the cameras limitations the more you use it, you're still left with the fact that this camera doesn't do as good a job as cameras from other manufactures when it comes to video quality and manual adjustments.For example, I had a Sony TX7 that took far nicer videos & pictures and it cost the same. Of course, the TX7 isn't made for the same purpose as the GoPro but given the added feature set of the TX7 and the utter lack of features on the GoPro camera, one would think that the GoPro company would have put forth a product with superior video. Video with shadows and bright objects in the same frame rarely looks nice from any manufacturer of sub $300 cameras - some part of the image is lost - but the GoPro lags behind others in high-contrast situations, and in video smoothness & sharpness.The suction mount is worthless--most are. The suction cup wouldn't hold to any surface. I glued the suction mount's base to a plate with a bolt extending out from the base which was then attached to a magnet which was then mounted to my truck's roof. The magnet should not be near the camera. So all was not lost on the suction mount. I'd rather have the chest harness for motorsports than the suction cup. The helmet mounts work very well.The camera's controls are simple, and as many have pointed out, something out of the 1980's in terms of interface design. I knew this going in and was happy to trade it for a longer battery life. However, if your eyesight is poor you won't much like the interface design. Icons are super small and the LCD can be hard to read. I wanted a camera with a long battery life, quality video, and a bulletproof design. GoPro isn't quite there but your POV waterproof action camera options are fairly limited. And, GoPro has a good dealer network for buying supplies like extra batteries & mounts.The mounting selections have held up to my abuse (except the suction cup). I have a head & chest harness and a tripod mount. The camera's housing is a little disappointing as is the camera (seems cheaply made -- hard to say since I haven't had it long enough to pass fair judgement). I always feel like I'm going to break the plastic case when I shut it. The silver nut that accepts the mounting bolt fell out of my head harness mount. I made the mistake of assuming the nut was permanently attached to the mounting plate. It wasn't. That's a design flaw IMO. Friends have complained about the underwater video that the camera produces. I have yet to try the underwater shooting. I don't trust the GoPro housing to protect the camera because of statements on the instruction sheet suggesting that the slightest grain of sand in the door can lead to water damage.I want that bulletproof camera with outstanding POV video--GoPro hasn't built it, yet.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "The mount doesn't swivel.", "Author": "Kevin Mahler", "ReviewID": "R2XWAYHFYFO3EL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought one of these and a Contour camera at the same time.

The waterproof case is great and works very well underwater.The one gripe I have with this camera is the quality and reliability.After less than three months the battery went bad. Rather than exchange the battery, GoPro replaced the camera with a refurbished one instead of a new camera.Consequently I ended up with a used camera that conked out less than a year after that. I called GoPro and since it was out of warranty, they offered me 20% off of a newer model. While it is better than nothing I just don't think that a 20% discount is sufficient for a camera that barely lasts a year. If I had been using it daily it would have been palatable but I only used it when I flew on long trips every 6 weeks or so.So for a camera that has seen very little use it really should last more than a year.My next camera will be a Sony, while not as versatile at least the quality is there.", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great HD Video", "Author": "Bill Streb", "ReviewID": "R1JXJU4AO7101G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Welcome to the world of HD video recording, in a super small package.

My first dive trip with the camera in it's original housing (not the dive housing) was between 50-75 feet. Down at depth, the pressure compressed the rubber seal enough to where the top latch would free itself. The water pressure was enough to hold the back door closed of course... until I surfaced and didn't realize it wasn't latched. The result was an unlatched housing half full of seawater. I immediately dumped the water out, removed the battery and gave it a rinse with fresh water when I got back to the beach.

Their service is one of the best I've encountered, and will enjoy the dive housing that removes the underwater soft focus problem.If you need a non-zoom video camera (also capable of still photos) to capture wide-angles (several angles selectable) in hi-def, any of the Hero cameras will nicely fill the bill.

It just gives you a bigger picture and it's not as easy to miss the perfect angle (which can happen in 1080p and then you end up just filming the tip of your skis or just the sky).The stickers to glue the camera mount to your helmet have held very well so far. I have landed on my helmet a few times and the camera still sits tightly up there. Really cool stuff!Excited to try it out in new areas soon, like on a JetSki, Quad, Skidiving etc. Perfect for those things!Major downside: the picture function requires a real stable hand (head in this case), as they can come up blurry otherwise.

I use it on motorcycle rides mainly.The good: Waterproof, dustproof, lots of mounts, case is very solid, fairly easy to operate with one handThe bad: Wind noise is horrible with either backing. Cant hear anything but wind over 20mph. Video quality is not great for a $300 video-camera. Wide angle is achieved with a \"fishbowl\" lens that distorts everything. Pictures are horrible because of distortion and 5MP cheap sensor. Difficult to achieve proper alignment when on a helmet. Handlebar mount broke, luckily plastic case is tough. case fogs up in rain or high humidity, or low temperatures, with either backing on. Video is often grainy, or pixelated, or go in and out of focus when moving quickly, even in bright sunlight, on either 720p or 1080. Go pro is about even with my $70 kodak easyshare sport, but the kodak takes better photos and they are not walleye. Some sd cards it will not read for no apparent rhyme or reason. Sandisk 8gb class 6 wouldnt work, another sandisk 4gb class 4 does. Ordered it with a transcend 32gb class 10, that wouldnt work in go pro, but worked perfectly in any other camera. ?Conclusion: It does take video in extreme conditions and videos are fun to watch. I have not used any other helmet cams, that may be better or cheaper. My video opinions are based on point and shoot cameras that take better video.

Wish there was a standard viewfinder or display on the unit to help aim it.  Maybe they need to include a set of aiming lasers that helps you aim where the camera is looking, like one of their competitors has done.Sometimes the 1080p video quality is really quite good.  Sometimes it is just not sharp.  When it get lower light, the camera must be adjusting the aperature, decreasing the depth of field and the image becomes less sharp.  I really don't like the \"less sharp\" images of the lower light video.  I have even looked into replacing the front bubble lens case cover with some of the flat aftermarket lens covers...which are intended to help the underwater focus issue, but haven't seen any discussion on if these new, after market lens covers help when on ground and not underwater.I sent a note to Gopro customer support and asked about the problem with non-sharp video and all I got was an email asking for as sample of the image.

Tonsing", "ReviewID": "R361D1JY8BD4JE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The first thing you will notice is that the instructions are terrible. There are lots of things left out, which you'll need to figure out on your own. For instance, how does one remove the \"removable water proof door,\" to get better sound? There is a hinge pin, but it is wedged in there pretty tight. And the instructions for downloading to your computer are cryptic at best. I have been just removing the SD card and plugging it directly into my PC. It's easy to preview the files in Windows Media Viewer.Also, Go Pro is incredibly cheap, as far as what is left out. No battery charger is included, so if you don't happen to be next to your computer for four hours, you are out of luck. You have to charge it using the USB cable hooked to a computer. I'll bet a charger could have been made for about $3. They could have included a 1 or 2 GB SD card, but they didn't. If you don't happen to have one lying around, you will be frustrated when trying to use the camera out of the box. They are pretty stingy with mounting hardware too. You'll need to harvest part of the packaging mount to use some of the other mounts. I also found a nut was missing in one of the brackets.Aiming the camera is hit or miss. There is no LCD view screen at all, so you just have to guess on the aiming, and hope for the best. A useful accessory would be a small LCD screen that attaches with Velcro to your jacket, and plugs into the camera's USB port. I'm not aware of this being available.Sound is very muted if you are using the water proof back. I have not been able to change backs yet, because the hinge pin won't budge with a paper clip, so I don't know what the sound is like with the other back.Changing settings is so complicated, you will want to set and forget, or else bring along the instruction sheets so you can figure it out. If you are used to DSLRs and pro video cameras, as I am, you will find the tiny front LCD readout to be extremely cryptic.Overall, I think several generations, and a dozen improvements down the road, and at about a $175 price point, this will be a much more desirable camera.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "GoPro HD", "Author": "Supamegaman", "ReviewID": "R39P0DIBKZOFDZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is great.

I couldn't make out anything that had been recorded.After a few weeks of playing around with the different camera setting such as 1080i or the 60fps 720 I found my favorite setting. I leave it on the 3 setting (720) due to its resistance to frame shutter and being able to throw it into Twixtor and pumping out some super slow-mo. 1080i is overrated compared to slow mo in my honest opinion.I was able to take the camera into the ocean and play around with it.

We both snowboard and thought this would be really fun for capturing jumps and stuff. We went out to Aspen last year with another couple and they had the GoPro helmet and it was awesome, at the end of the day we got to watch the video of our day on the mountain. It also inspired us to try things we might not normally try- made the day of skiing/snowboarding that much more interesting and exciting. I can't really attest to durability because I have yet to see a major wipeout with the GoPro, but the case it comes in seems pretty legit, and you can apparently fix it to a surfboard too, so i'm assuming its gotta be pretty durable, since its made for somewhat \"extreme\" usage. Its fairly easy to use, but because its so small alot of the setup stuff has to be done via tv or computer, since there is no screen on the actual camera. So far its looking pretty awesome, but haven't really tested it out enough to spot potential negatives.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera, great price, few issues", "Author": "M. Peezick \"Quality > Quantity\"", "ReviewID": "R3TZFDON6AQUMP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera primarily for paintball games.  I got it with the Helmet Hero system, which came with a variety of mounts, including the one I currently use, the headstrap. The video quality is good, full HD, and the view from the 1080p resolution has far less distortion than some of the other resolutions (although I wish I had control of just how much).  It is durable, small and lightweight.  Not the smallest or the lightest of the many action cameras out there, but is easy to use and mount, especially from a first person perspective (I hate side-view perspectives).The menus take a while to go through, but I don't expect to use most of the options, so its not a huge deal.  I set it up ahead of time, and then I just have to hit record.  Battery life is decent, although I wish it was longer.  I will definitely need to buy another battery.  The price is good, right there with the many other options out there, and cheaper than many others as well. Audio is decent, and I know its not the usual focus of these kinds of products, but I hope future models incorporate better microphones, just to keep putting GoPro past the competition, since I think sound is important along with image clarity.  The one bad thing about the video is that the camera isn't the fastest out there with regards to focusing or adapting to change light, so there will sometimes be wavy distortion, odd coloring, or overly bright lighting at times, although not for very long.  I know some of this is due to the technology itself, but something that can be improved upon in the future.Overall, I looked at a lot of similar products for months, contemplating all the advantages to each, differences between, pricing, future models, accessories, etc, and I bought this one overall all others, and I'm glad I did.  Not that it means much to whomever reads my reviews, but I've noticed over the years that many of my friends and family tend to look to me on product advice, whether asking directly to advise them on a product they should buy, or simply buying the same thing I've bought.

I mainly bought it for snowboarding but since its not winter yet I haven't got to use it for that yet. I have used it for mountain biking and it works great. Its not quite as stable as it looks on commercials but I'm sure thats just a matter of running it through the right editing software. For mountain biking I've found the 720p @ 60fps works best. There is just too much shaking in the camera for the 1080p mode. 1080p looks great on smooth surfaces though like on the street or side walk. I'm very impressed with how clear the picture is even with flying over rough terrain. I can't wait to use it on the snow. My two lowest ratings were for the ease of use and the sound quality. Ease of use was because the menu system can be confusing and hard to navigate especially if you don't have the LCD screen. With the screen its a bit easier but still takes forever to get through the menues and if you miss what you were looking for you have to scroll all the way back through.  These issues are only a problem when you are trying to use other modes. Since I typically just shoot video and don't switch resolutions that often this isn't much of an issue since I just always leave it in the same mode and just start or stop recording wich is done by just hitting the shutter button on the top. I do wish there was a easier and faster away to change the camera modes and also the resolution but that would probably make the camera bigger and I would rather keeping the clunky menu system to keep it the size it is. The other low score I gave it was for sound and thats only because I have a back ground in sound recording. So compared to high end sound equipment its not that good. But compared to other little video cameras this is the best I have ever heard. Even with the full water proof case I'm still amazed how well the sound comes out. If you don't need the camera to be water proof and your at speeds less then 100mph the open back doors are the best way to go. It picks up voices from pretty far away and they are pretty clear. Even while moving the mic does a great job at reducing wind noise. On play back I can still here conversations even while moving. With the full water proof housing you do have to be pretty close to the camera to be able to hear anything but it does even better as far as wind noise. I was flying down a mountain bike trail the other day and I couldn't hear any wind.The accessories made for this camera are plentiful. There are so many ways to mount this camera. The sticky mounts seem really secure as long as its a smooth and clean surface. I tried mounting them to my car dash and it just wont stay. Its because my dash is bumpy and the sticky tape just doesn't stick well to this kind of surface. If you get the tripod adapter then that opens even a bigger world of mounting and stand options. Even know the mounts all seem secure and strong I like to have my camera tethered just incase they fail in some way. I do this simply with some fairly thick fishing line. Doesn't have to be super thick but its thicker then average. Just tie it to the camera and the other end to your helmet, car, bike ext... Its just a safe guard because I would hate loosing this 300 doller toy. All in all I love this camera and would recommend it to anyone looking for a wearable camera to capture there favorite sports. I find myself always wanting to record everything now. Its so great to be able to capture all those enjoyable moments in such a small package.

I did this so I could evaluate another action camera.  So far I have Kayaked with it and tried multiple mounting locations on my car and motorcycle.  I would halfto say that the mounting of the Gopro is sufficient but not optimal.  The ATC9K was not perfect either but did offer easier adjustment without needing to alter setting for upside down mounting.The Video quality is nearly identical, recordings from my ATC9K in full 1080P and the new Gopro 1080P can hardly be differentiated.  That being said, I have noticed some frame glitch on the GoPro.  This is noticeable when street signs or light posts are passing bye in the field of view as they are smooth for several seconds then jump to nearly off screen.  I repeated this observation with several different SD cards all the way up to my Class 10 20mb/s card used in my professional digital still camera and still had a frame glitch as I had suspected it was a buffer to card data flow issue... nope.  I have been altering the setting from r1 to r5 and regardless of the setting, there is a frame glitch every couple of seconds.  Granted it could be my camera is defective but the issue is not significant enough for me to want to go through the long process of replacing it.  So if anyone else has this issue please let me know, or if not I might be motivated to replace it.Battery life:  As the documents say it will record for over two hours, and it does.  I have made fully charged to dead battery recordings several times to validate this and each one has been from 2.1 to 2.5 hrs.  The ATC9K without the GPS unit installed would also makes these times also, with GPS unit, about \u00be the time due to greater load.  The GPS unit was a nice addition though. HINT to GoPro!!!! How about a GPS Backpack attachment?The Standard SD card slot is nice and makes for easy manipulation of video, not to mention the price decrease for some really nice 32 gb class 10 cards out there for less than $100. The ATC9K uses the micro SD cards which are kind of a pain in the @#$...Hope this was helpful, any question feel free to contact me", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for action photography", "Author": "richard travis gibbs", "ReviewID": "R1UMPDG2W0YIGE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This little video camera packs alot of versatility in a small package.  If you want to mount it somewhere there is most likely a mount available that will fit your specific application.

I tend to leave mine set on 720p at 60fps.  The menus are a bit difficult to navigate, however its an action camera and I think intended to remain on one setting during your activity.  Honestly I would have to have the instructions with me if I wanted to change the settings.  In addition, the sound quality is pretty rough if you have the waterproof housing on.  I also noticed when I had it attached to my mountain bike, it picked up alot of bike noise, I would assume through the frame. One of my brakes was clicking cause the brake disc was bent and thats about all you could hear in the video is the clicking noise the whole time.  Also, a word of caution, while this camera is waterproof, it does not float.

So I got it exchanged, then the 2nd one program was all messed up, it wouldn't let me go into settings and weird things showed up on screen.  I managed to make it finally update the firmware after multiple tries, but that didn't help either.  So I had to bring back to sport chalet once again.

Indoor filming is pretty poor, its really a daytime use camera only.  I really like the superwide angle lens, takes a little getting used to.

For most people this is a good choice.Still, I returned mine to the manufacturer. I bought directly on their web site which has a 30 day return policy.The videos on their web site are works of art - but you will notice that many are done in midair or on smooth surfaces so there is minimal vibration. In a skateboard video on their web site there is actually no footage from the Hero on his chest mount while he is rolling!  it was filmed by the observer!For my application I was recording going down a choppy mountain trail. In the test video link below you can see the affect.[...]It is not bad - but I preferred video from an old Canon G9 strapped to my chest even though its resolution and frame rate were much less.In the video you can see that the video has a yellow hue until after 20 seconds at which time it goes away. And the view is almost fisheye making my arms bowed.Setup is easy only if you have the instructions in front of you since there are just a couple of buttons and a small menu square on the front. That is OK if you plan to setup once and not make field changes. Results can not be seen until you get home.With my unit I could not get the SD card out. Once in if you press again it should pop right out. Not so with mine.I tried the same mountain bike run with a Nikon S9100 strapped to my chest. The results were not as good as with the Hero. The problem with modern cameras is the Progressive Shutter that gives jerky video a jello affect. So my quest will continue - perhaps foam padding on the chest mount. Perhaps finding a camera with a Global Shutter instead of Progressive.So view some of the YouTube videos by real users doing the things you want to record.

It's a great camera that produces high quality HD video and when used with the slotted back on the case, also produces good audio. I had first bought a Contour HD helmet cam because I thought the form factor was a little more appealing, but I had to return it because it suffered from interference whenever I turned on my 2.4 GHz RC transmitter. This exhibited itself as a low frequency hum in the processed video. The GoPro doesn't have that problem and works very well for my intended use. I bought the GoPro head strap mount that places the camera on the front of your head and it works great even when wearing a baseball cap, as I do when flying.I use it in the 1080p 30 fps mode because I like the narrower angle for my use. The battery has long life and with a 15gb SD card the longest I have recorded is 1.5 hours continuous, and I could have gone much longer. It's output is in the form of .mp4 files which are accepted by most video editing programs directly. By using the solid back on the case, it can be used underwater but the audio will suffer. The Motorsports version comes with all kinds of pieces for mounting to helmets and other surfaces. Unfortunately, if you want the head strap mount as I did, you have to pay extra for it.Overall, a great sports camera for almost any use.

Here's some video I just uploaded (excuse the driving - it was only my 2nd weekend in my short racing career).  This is using the 960 line resolution mode, which gives a \"taller\" view, so you don't have to worry about the mounting angle.  This is at 30fps, but there is also a 60fps mode that is REALLY smooth.  A 16GB card has plenty of room for 3hrs+, so I simply turn it on when I belt in, and forget about it (camera can handle up to a 32gb card - I'm just too cheap).  Takes 2min to edit out the extra video when you get back, or simply click ahead when viewing.  It uses a mini-USB (same as my cell phone) for charging, and got fully charged between sessions in plenty of time.  For next time, I'm planning on using the 1.5\" extention to get more of the cockpit (wheel, shifter, etc).Best part about it is that I took it off of the car, and am using it for filming pheasant hunting, snowboarding, waterskiing, etc.  For $250, it is a slam dunk for me.

All accessories are of quality materials and fit perfectly.If the user interface and especially the reliability of the recording was 10% of the mechanical beauty of this camera, it would be a solid 5 star rating.Much like I others, I find the neolithic user interface very cumbersome. a 3 digit display guides you through all the settings of metering, frame rate, resolution, and recording settings. 3 digits of weirdly chosen acronyms.But that is not my main grievance as I could probably live with a single setting and consulting the manual now and then. My main complaint is that every ride, the camera finds yet another reason for stop recording or not recording at all. With 3 different SD cards, it would stop recording within minutes, with the last purchase of Amazon SD products, it now usually lasts 15+ minutes on a good day.Even inside a car where the vibration level is low and no wind forces torment the camera, it very, very often quits with a beeping code and then refuses to resume recording.Now that I finally found a brand of SD cards it actually accepts it goes through different burn rates with the battery. How can a camera this size drain a full charge in 20 something minutes? It doesn't always do it but now and then and it is impossible to predict. I bough it for recording experiments and for documentation but it simply cannot be trusted. At least not my model.My 2nd complaint would be that it is an absolute memory hog. For the tiny, grainy sensor, one could hope for a more aggressive compression but it loves to pose as a FullHD and chew through the storage at an impressive pace.The excellent reviews I find here suggest that not all models have the same quirks.

You can wipe off the drops, but when you take the next wave and water hits it, there the drops are...once again.The camera seems like a great deal because of the price, but you end up having to invest in all of the extra pieces to make it an enjoyable camera. i.e. the extra view screen backing, then the antifog, then the attachment pieces. The list seems to continue.The fish eye lens doesn't video or take pics clearly for long distance and there is no zoom. Also, the fish eye lens makes the waves you ride look super small.

The videos of my surfing sessions look great from the standpoint of color, vividness, sharpness and generally mirror what I'm seeing while out on my board surfing.2. The GoPro actually is watertight in all surfing conditions (freefalls to the bottom of a wave, getting pounded in the impact zone, being pushed really deep in bad wipeouts etc) and the mount will stay on even in these rough conditions.3. It's light. I ride kneeboards (5' 7\") that don't have much flotation and mounting the GoPro on the front of my boards doesn't change the riding characteristics of my boards. Very important to me.4. Seems to be designed and well made by techinical types.Now the weak areas from my point of view:1. For surfing, the field of view even at 170 degrees is too narrow. I usually can't actually see the wave i'm riding when playing back the video. What I do see in the video when I take off on a wave is the water rapidly rushing by the front of my board, the pier i'm surfing towards, and the beach in the distance. The wave itself is outside the field of view of the camera and can't be seen. This makes the camera and the surfboard mount useless for me. Too bad because it does take nice vivid pictures in strong sunlight.2. The lens has a lot of distortion. Normally the distortion isn't too noticeable, until I paddle out under Huntington Pier in between the pilings. The pilings are severely bowed and distorted rather than straight. This isn't too bad a problem because I can straighten them out with software processing, but it is a sign that the lens lacks quality.3. The user interface must have been designed and written by technical types for other technical types. The interface is so geeky compared to my other digital cameras that it's almost funny (in a grim sort of way). I eventually figured out what it was all about, but it took awhile. Once I figured it out I understood it, but if I don't use the camera for several months, I have to go back and learn how it works all over again.Summary:I bought the GoPro camera to take surfing videos, but since I can't see the wave itself because the field of view is too narrow and the mount doesn't swivel left or right so I could face it towards the wave ahead of me, it's usless. Too bad. It's a good idea from people who don't actually use the camera and board mount for surfing and it shows.My son is an avid bicycle rider in red rock country and I'm going to give the GoPro to him to record his rides out in the desert.

After going through the primitive menu system I finally got it set to my specs.  However, there's not a way to remember all the weirdly labeled settings so I'll need to carry the instruction sheet for awhile, if I choose to keep it.  That said, the instructions aren't very good and don't include all the settings available. I left the undescribed ones on default, not knowing what they were.I've taken a number of photos with it (150 or so) and unless I'm on the highest HD setting, the images are very grainy.  It's next to impossible to take a still photo so it's obvious the camera is intended for video. I normally shoot underwater stills with my much larger Olympus PEN2; I'm not a videographer. However, I wanted a smaller camera as I'll only be doing a couple of dives this trip. Since I won't be able to review shots underwater I could be stuck with dozens of images with lots of motion.

It did that. . . .for most of two minutes on a fresh set of AAA rechargeable NiMH batteries.  After that, neither new batteries nor the norse gods smiled on me as I tried in vain to get the camera to function for any length of time.  I got weary of trouble shooting it: trying all the fixes recommended online, on forums, in emails, in my dreams etc.  That was most of two years ago.  (rant: There's something about trouble shooting new stuff that really hacks me off.  I mean, it's NEW.  It either works as it should or it doesn't out of the box.  I'm not on their payroll: no one pays me to trouble shoot their products to get them to work. End of rant - thank you.)That said, it can accurately be said as well that my disappointment with this camera is laregely my fault for not returning it to the seller (couldn't: ebay) or returning it to GoPro in a timely manner and let THEM trouble shoot it.SO, this review has it's inconsistencies; not the least of which is my impatience with trouble shooting new stuff and intolerance for when it doesn't work after applying known possibilities.  Eventually, all's I could see was a unit that didn't work and the costs associated with shipping and repairing it.  So, I gave up and the camera & accessories got put in a box.________________I was cleaning out my office the other day and re-discovered the camera.  So, I contacted GoPro and explained the situation to see if they could use an out-of-warranty camera that didn't work (parts, refurb, etc.).  They offered me 20% off a new camera.  That was kind of them at this late date and speaks well of their customer service.  But, I doubt I'll own another GoPro product.________________At this point, the camera and all the accessories are junk that GoPro doesn't want and no one else could use.  (I wouldn't feel right selling it to anyone).________________Besides whatever criticism I might deserve, I'm left with a bad impression of GoPro cameras and can only offer this advice to potential buyers: if you have no patience with trouble shooting new stuff, do NOT buy this camera.There's a lot of positive reviews here so it's unlikely that GoPro customer service folks will chime in on my review to explain that their more recent models are new and improved and require no trouble shooting out of the box to work as advertised.  I hope that's the case and buyers of newer GoPro cameras don't have to trouble shoot the product.I gave it two stars which I think allows for my failures & impatience along the way and GoPro's 20% offer.  I still don't trust the product line though.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Battery life is limited - Serious issue", "Author": "M.

This would hold up to 8 hours of footage. The problem is that the camera could never keep up with that much since the battery only lasts for about 3 hours. Terrible issue when this is used for skiing and recharging is not an option on a mountain.

Adams", "ReviewID": "RF8WM213IJK4A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Without a doubt the camera takes great pictures; however, beyond that the overall quality is less than expected.First, its an HD camera that by the product description and manual should work with 2 through 32 Gig SD cards.. the only card it works with is a 2GB SD - and I'm using top of the line SD cards from Kingston, PNY and Sandisk.  The instructions say there is an flash update for filming upside down - there isn't.  The additional roll bar mount kit slips and doesn't hold the camera still and the bag says the manual is on the web site.. but there's no manual there so I have no idea if I'm using it correctly or not.. but so far all configurations allow the camera mount to move and cannot be locked into place.  Lastly outside of the packaging there is nothing that tells you that you've got a surf HD that's rated down to 180 feet.  The case looks exactly like every other waterproof model and the camera has no indication that it is an surf HD capable model.2GB SD card + 1080P 16:9 resolution = 26 minutes of video on a single HD card and you have to stop and dump the video or change the card.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "received camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1OOZAADWC4XRR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera on May 27.

I'm sure its a good camera but I won't know till they ship it and I can try it.Update:I did finally receive the camera sometime during the summer. I actually went and bought the camera from a local rei and a month or so later Amazon finally shipped. So I have 2 of them. I then picked up a stereo housing and that's where the two cameras live.Interface... TerribleImages... Low color saturationSound... Can't expect much from a water proof housing.Should you buy it? NO Buy the Gopro Hero HD 2!Better imageBetter low light and color balanceBetter sound (with an open housing)Better interfacePS Dont buy it from amazon unless you want to wait a real long time.

The specs on the cmera statethat you should get aout 3 hours of recording time on a set of lithium batteries but the truth is that you will get at most about 30 minutes of recording time. That's 7 - 9 dollars every 30 minutes to use this camera.I did give support every opertunity to correct the problem. I sent my camera back twice (whch they said they replaced with a new one yet they had the same markings on them that I put on them) and finaly made them send me another one before I sent the last one back. The result... I now have two cameras that go through a set of batteries every 30 minutes. Their response... \"...have you tried lithium bateries?\".Bottom line... if you dont mind canging bateries every 30 minutes go for it.

I recived a GoPro HD Hero Motorsports Eddition. It comes with everything the naked does but it came with a lot more mounts. If i would of Recii did not recive thved a naked this would be a 5 star. but because i did not get the product i ordered i have to give it 4 star. i know i got a better deal, but if i had ordered a motor sports hero and recived a naked.it is 4star I would of been pisted so that is why it is 4 star.***About the Product***this is one of, or the smallest, waterproof, shockproof, little camera that shoots in 1080p and 60fps that is out there.
