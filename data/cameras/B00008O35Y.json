I got it about 2 months ago and it has been invaluable.  I will never take a picture with film again!  The quality of the pictures is absolutely amazing!!  '[m not an photography expert, so I wanted something that was easy to use but did not want to sacrifice quality and this is it!  The batteries last much longer then other digital cameras I have used.  Of course the memory stick is very small, but that it typical for all digital cameras.  You will need an extra one, and b/c this is 5 megapixels the memory stick will hold less pictures that images taken at 4 megapixels or less.  And the great thing about this is if you need extra batteries you can buy any rechargable batteries and use that!  No expensive extra ... batteries here!  The size is nice and small so it fits in my tiny purse.  I've tried other cameras that were so small they looked so fragile.  Not this!  I have no complaints at all about this camera!!

The photos that it takes are amazing. It is wonderful to get the 5MP quality at such a price and with such features. Also, its acceptance of the Memory Stick Pros just makes me giddy. 1GB o' photos at 5MP? Yes please. It is so light and compact. I can carry it easily in my pocket (which already has my cell phone in it). Being able to choose the quality of the movies that one makes is truly a bonus as well, as one does not need to waste quality on MPGs that are simply going to be e-mailed. Very well thought out design. I'd expect nothing less from Sony.(Still, it does not begin to compare to my Nikon SLR, but at a tiny fraction of the cost of the body and lenses, it seems like quite a nice trade-off. Plus, I don't have to fumble with lenses, filters, and the like in order to catch a shot.

Aside from that, the camera is absolutely great.  5MP gives you obvious great quality.  A feature that I didn't think I would use much is really becoming more of a handy feature, the A/V MPEG mode.  It will not replace a video camera, but being able to snap 50 pictures at 5MP and take about 7 minutes of footage has been really nice.  (I have a 256MB Stick)  Overall, I'm very happy with the camera.  Like the Sony name, and it feels nice and durable in your hands.  I certainly can recommend this camera, but honestly, buy a memory stick, and I would not recommend anything below 128MB.  256MB is nice as you get about 100-120 5MP pictures.", "Date": "June 13, 2003"}, {"Title": "Excellent quality digital camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RZ6BHYZ4753ZM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've only had my Cybershot for a week, but so far, I've been very impressed with the quality of the camera, the clarity of the pictures, and the ease of use of the camera. I was able to use this camera for Thanksgiving, just a day after receiving it, and was still able to get some great pictures, so the learning curve is very small. I have settled on 3:2 mode, which is about 4.5 megapixels, versus the full 5 megapixel mode. The main reason for this is my desire to produce accurate 4x6 prints, which the 3:2 mode does to a \"T\". This camera takes breathtaking outdoor shots, and very good indoor shots. I've taken most of my shots in the point n shoot mode, with everything set to auto, and the pictures have all, for the most part, been great. I like the fact that I do have some degree of manual control over exposure, metering, focus, etc., because I do intend to explore all the different ways to take a picture with this camera, but for now, I'm very happy just shooting everything in auto mode. The movie mode is cool, if not a little on the jerky side (due to only 16fps), but I do like having the capability to record small movies, if the need arises. For now though, I just use the camera for taking pictures. The batteries and charger that come with the camera are top notch. It took me days to run them down. I did buy an extra set online for 9 dollars, so I should have no problems with battery life. I recommend buying a memory stick, as 16MB is a joke. I bought a 256MB (128MB x 2) memory stick online for about 80. I'd stay away from the memory stick pro. The magic gate stuff takes up way too much of the memory sticks memory.

Wait for deals, here on Amazon as well, and you can find 256MB sticks for [some money].

I'm not an avid photographer, just one who likes to take shots of the grandchildren around the house and occasionally pics for inclusion in a Word document.  I don't use any of the more detailed setting and I've yet to read all of the manual.But it takes beautiful pictures using just the point-and-shoot mode.  The color balance and color correctness looks very good, even in those pictures shot indoors using incandescent lighting.

A great combination.03/31/2004 update:  I have to agree with the reviewer who said the 16M memory stick is inadequate.  It only yields 24 pictures at 1.2M resolution in Auto mode (wherein pictures are forced to Fine mode instead of Standard mode, effectively halving the number of pictures one can fit on the stick).

Williams \"Lloyd Vincent\"", "ReviewID": "RLM9GHUDK27AF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this product for 4 months now, so I feel I'm ready to write my review.When I bought this camera, there were two things that compelled me to select this camera over others. the 5-mega-pixels, and the fact that it was made by Sony, a company that I've come to trust.I'm sure you've probably already heard what's good about this camera, so I'm just going to skip all that and cover what I think the buyer should be aware of, namely... what they can expect to go wrong.The point-and-shoot architecture is very intuitive, but not for professionals. One thing I was looking forward to with this camera was playing around with the manual camera settings. I quickly lost interest in this because you can't change the shutter speed, which is what I really wanted to play with.The size of the camera is nice. It's a little smaller than the 1-time use film cameras, although much heavier. maybe about the weight of a small coffee cup.The 3x optical zoom is great, but going beyond 3x the camera starts to use digital zoom. You can get up to 12x, but the picture quality really, really drops off beyond about 6x.The camera takes pictures in standard computer screen proportions (although it has one wide-screen option). This is great for computers, but can pose a problem for people wanting to actually develop their pictures, as standard picture sizes are proportionally wider than computer screens. The top and/or bottom of your pictures may get cut off.For indoor pictures, there is a problem. To function as a hand-held camera, you either have to have ROCK steady hands, or extremely bright lighting. Anything other than this will give you some problems with blurry pictures. After about a month of finding shelves and countertops or books to set my camera on for picture-taking, I bought a 5 dollar tripod that has expanded my options for using the camera and also just made it less troublesome on the whole. Taking pictures in the pre-set \"landscape\" mode can also result in blurry pictures, even if the lighting is magnificent.The battery life can be troublesome, but a fully-charged set of batteries can last you an entire, fairly rigorous day of picture taking. I suggest buying an extra set of batteries, but if you can tolerate the thought of needing to take a picture, but having your batteries be in the charger, then it's not necessary.When you turn on the camera, the lens twists and moves out of the body. This very cool to watch, I think... but compared to other cameras it is a little noisy; perhaps about the decibel level of a person next to you listening to loud music on poor-quality headphones. It's not annoying, because the sound only happens when you turn the camera on or off, or use the zoom feature.There is a strange sound I discovered that is always going with this camera when it is on though. It's inaudible for the most part, but if you hold your ear directly against the display screen, you hear all sorts of cool mechanical beeps and stuff. it's probably not too healthy to do this... but it can't be worse than talking on a cell-phone all day :-PThe 16mb memory stick has got to be some sort of cosmic joke. You can fit at most 5 high quality pictures on it. I suggest, nay, DEMAND that you get AT LEAST a 128mb memory stick. But, keep the 16mb around as backup (you never know when you will run out of space and need to take one quick picture).The screen was great, no pixels on mine were burnt out (check for burnt out pixels on your camera if you are buying from a retail store where you actually get to test the camera before buying it). But the screen is missing something. Most Japanese cameras and cell-phones put a clear, hard-plastic cover on these screens, which is very useful for those people who always feel they need to touch and point (those wierd colors that you see when you touch the screen are BAD).The movie mode is nice for catching moments like kissing your lover, friend's falling off their skateboards, and so on. But don't plan on becoming the next Steven Spielberg with this. The camera will record directly to .mpg format, which is nice because you can play this format on almost any computer without needing to install anything. I say 'almost' only because I'm sure there are some linux distros that don't include a video player.The cord that hooks your camera up to an AV-in port is great. you can watch your movies in decent quality on the TV screen, and do a slideshow type thing of your pictures. I like to use this in conjunction with my VCR to record movies, this gets MUCH better quality than the built-in video mode and records to a VHS, which can be handy. But the cord is rather short, so I can't record anything outside or in another room.The USB hook-up to your computer is very handy. And transferring a full load (128mb) of data to my computer never takes more than 2 minutes, which I think is very reasonable considering how easy it is to set up. The camera will pop up in your computer and you can browse it just as you would any regular folder. Your pictures are stored as JPG pictures (of course) and in windows xp, you can switch to 'thumbnail' view and find the picture you are looking for right away. I have had some problems getting my computer to detect the USB connection, but I've always been able to fix this by rebooting.This is a great camera. Under the right conditions and with a fair amount of awareness, you can take magnificent pictures. But it's not the magical camera that is going to work perfectly all the time and under every possible circumstance. I don't think such a camera exists.

We have had the camera for several month now and it is probably one of the best products I've ever owned. We've been in several trips now since we bought it and I can not imagine leaving on vacation without it. Stop thinking about.

You will get your money back along the years by saving in development, and you will be able to share your memories with your family and friends through email.---I bought this camera the day it was released. The day after receiving it we left, along with the new camera, for our summer vacations in Las Vegas. I'm glad I bought this camera, otherwise my wife would have used 5 or 6 24 exposure films. The camera is very easy to use, very compact, and it comes at a good price. The quality of the pictures was beyond my expectation. I was surprise to see how well the camera automatically adjusted at different light conditions. I was able to take good pictures with just a click of the shutter. I need to mention that this camera is replacing my 35mm Canon EOS 650 from which I took excellent pictures, but it was just too dificult to carry around. The battery life of the included NiMH is very good as well. I was able to run  the camera the whole day without recharging, taking about 25 pictures per day, and of course watching the results right after.  Make sure you buy additional memory sticks, because you are going to need them. At 5 megapixels and fine resolution you only get 51 pictures in a 128MByte memory stick. Fortunately, the price of the memory stick has dramatically dropped in the last couple of weeks. This camera also supports the new Memory Stick Pro, which comes in 256,512, and 1024 MByte configuration. I also recommend buying the LCS-CP2 Soft Carrying Case, and a Sony 128 MB Memory Stick Media MSA128A along with the camera.

I took comparison shots with my Olympus--same object, same lighting, same everything--and the Sony blew it every time. I saw graininess in most of the low-lit Sony shots, and none with my old Olympus (and no blurring, either). Low-light shots without a flash are no problem for my Olympus.

I'm not heavy user of the camera.  It was never dropped (I took care of it like it was made of glass).  It was never kept in humid conditions. And no, it's not part of the CCD image issue.

The main reason I wanted to try this camera out is because it is a very compact, high pixel resolution, point-and-shoot camera.  I mean, five mega-pixels?  That's amazing for the size, I currently own a Minolta Dimage Z2 and it has 4.0MP resolution and it is a much bigger camera.  I am quite impressed with the pictures this camera takes, I can blow up the pictures quite a few sizes larger on my computer and it does not pixelate.This camera uses two AA batteries which is something that I prefer over lithium batteries. (lithium batteries cannot be found everywhere, and you must take care of them because they are not as easy to replace)  However, the battery life seems to be a little short.  Fully charged batteries may last you one full day, so I would recommend buying another set of batteries.If you are not looking for professional photography, then this is probably a pretty good choice of camera for you.  I didn't find so much satisfaction with it because I was looking to play around with the manual functions, but there are so very few, and you cannot even change the shutter speed which is something that I really want in a camera.The 3x optical zoon works nicely.  It's fairly silent, not as noisy as the start-up (which is not too bad itself, but is definitely noisy). However, once you go beyond 3x you switch into the digital zooming...which is not so good because you dramatically lose picture quality.  For that reason, I never zoom in beyond 3x, and 3x hardly seems like anything when you know that there are other camera out there that zoom in more.I found trouble taking pictures indoors...you either have to have a tripod to set it on or have very bright lighting.  Most people who buy this point-and-shoot camera probably are not looking for proffessional cameras, therefore many may not use tripods, meaning that if you take pictures indoors you must be sure that there is plenty of light, or else it will result in blurry pictures.It comes with a 16mb card...this, I found, to be quite humorous.  I mean, how many pictures can you fit on that thing?  Five to ten, about.  I was laughing a bit, luckily I also had handy the 128mb card, which I found worked out fine.Overall, under the right conditions it is a fairly nice camera.  It is not something that I would recommend to everyone, though.  Are you looking for a simple, point-and-shoot camera?  Then this is not a bad choice at all, 5MP, and under the company name Sony...that's pretty good, I think.Like I said before, I borrowed this camera from my aunt, and after trying it out I have decided not to buy it.  Mainly because it is point-and-shoot and that is not what I am looking for.  My aunt who only uses point-and-shoot loves this camera, though.
