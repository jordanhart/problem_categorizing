Peters", "ReviewID": "R2NAIM55C5ZDZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned 2 other digital cameras before (Kodak and Fuji) and without a doubt the Nikon Coolpix 5600 is in a league of its own.Although it is really small, it is surprisingly ergonomic. My hands are not tiny but compared to my other cameras this one fits very well and does not result in crampy hand muscles. The case is plastic but does not feel cheap.When I first picked up this camera, I had not read the manual. I just turned it on and started playing around with it. My first impression: It is VERY intuitive. The menu button on the back leads to varying choices which depend on which mode one choses (Auto, Scene, Portrait, Landscape, Sports, Night Shots and Movie). All the other buttons are straightforward as well. For example, if you want to delete a picture you just took, you simply press the button with the trash can symbol...Later I briefly went over the manual and also found it to be an easy read and very structured. Unlike many other manuals this one was not an ordeal.The 5600's autofocus is very fast. Of course if the flash is used, recharging takes a bit of time, but without flash the camera is ready for the next shot in a snap. The many program choices yield truly awesome results. I took mainly indoor pictures so far and am amazed at the quality. Unlike other cameras, the flash light does not wash out colors. The pictures come out balanced and just simply very nice and natural looking.I also really like the 'assist' functions: In some modes, one can set up the camera to display helpful frames, e.g. in Portrait mode one can have the outline of a person's head and shoulders diplayed. All the aspiring photographer has to do is to hold the camera in a position where the head of his/her subject is in the circle frame, shoot, and the camera does the rest. One can even display this frame on the left or, alternatively, on the right or take a portrait shot of two people with two such assist frames displayed.I have not yet had the time to try out all the functions (haven't tried Sports mode too much yet, or the copy function to copy back & white text) but one thing I can already say: This is not only the neatest camera I have owned so far, it also takes excellent pictures with very balanced flash-light  results. To me, one of the quality signs is how a digital camera handles the color red, and this one does a fine job in this area, too. To anyone considering this camera: Go for it, you won't be sorry. And the price it great, too!", "Date": "March 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "Nikon quality, but slow flash refresh.", "Author": "FreeFlight", "ReviewID": "R34PA41JQYVEAL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I tested the Coolpix 5600 to replace my Coolpix 2100, looking forward to the new features, such as a larger view screen, enhanced battery life, and some new photo features that allow you to choose black and white, or other color scales to enhance a photograph. Nikon quality is very high, and these cameras are very durable, though the hard plastic shells do tend to scratch a little with abuse. One positive change made to this camera was moving the photo dial from the top to the back side and minaturizing the dial. This is nice, since the top dial tended to move when the camera was taken out of a pocket or placed in a bag, which put the camera in a different shooting mode. One negative change was the loss of flexibily in battery choice. In the 2100, one could use the durable CR-V3 or any type of AA. This camera only accepts AA (Li, NiMH or alkaline) batteries, and this is negative because the refresh rate on the flash for this camera is relatively slow (3-7 seconds), independent of battery type (alkaline, NiMH or Energizer Li AA battery), even when the specific battery mode (alkaline, NiMH or Li) was chosen in the camera. The 2100 was a battery hog with a slow refresh rate for NiMH or alkaline batteries, but was an absolute champ with the disposable CR-V3 Li battery. Note that the 5600 does have a much better battery life using any AA battery compared to the 2100.Bottom line: A solid performer, durable pocket camera, uses any AA battery with reasonable battery lifetime, but flash refresh is relatively slow. Great for outside use, but for \"quick\" flash photography, consider spending the extra cash for a Li-rechargable battery camera, such as the Nikon 5900 or the Canon SD200 or SD300.", "Date": "March 31, 2005"}, {"Title": "The small wonder", "Author": "Vinayak Raghuvamshi", "ReviewID": "R1EM3ZM2TOIAMR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a camera buff and have used many cameras. I would say that this is by far the best camera its size. It is probably a matter of personal tastes, but I think this camera takes much better pictures than the Canon A95.White balance is wonderful, as with most Nikons.here are the things that rock:1. Compact and cute, fits in my jeans pocket2. Uses just two AA batteries and is light weight( weighs less than the A95)3. Has a lot of programming modes to handle almost all your day to day shooting needs4. Crisp and clear images5. Warns you that the image is going to be blurred before you shoot and also tells you if an image did turn out blurred so you dont have to waste memory saving it6. EXCELLENT Macro mode, look at the sample image I have posted7. Silent focusing8. Super fast USB file transfers9. Excellent value for moneyWhat could improve:1. The command dial feels flimsy2.

This camera has a lot of features and settings, but the flash recharge time takes about 5-10 seconds. To put it another way, right after you take a picture, the camera shuts down (screen goes black) for up to 10 seconds!  This makes the camera useless when you are trying to catch sports action or silliness. You are going to get one good picture (if the horrible shutter lag doesn't make you miss it) and thats it.

Soccer games, silliness around the house, etc.  I have been using the Kodak EasyShare digital camera, and have no complaints other than the size (it's on the larger size, and not convenient for just carrying around in my purse).  My Kodak is about 4 years old and has performed really well, but I was in the market for something with more megapixels and small enough to take everywhere.  My in-laws had visited a few weeks and I admired my mother-in-law's Nikon Coolpix 5900.  They very kindly purchased the 5600 for me for my birthday earlier this week.  I asked them to take it back.The camera has lots of neat features, as several other reviewers stated and it is small and user-friendly.  However, it took TWELVE SECONDS to recharge the flash between pictures.  Which pretty much means that if I'm taking pictures at my son's soccer game and I get a picture of him lining up to take a shot at the goal, I can forget any pictures of him actually making that goal.  Twelve seconds is way too long for me.Other than the recycle time, this is a neat little camera.  If time between shots is not an issue for you, than I would recommend it.  Otherwise, look at the 5900 or 7900 models.  They are a little more expensive, but absolutely worth it.My in-laws were very gracious and took the camera back and exchanged it for the 5900, which is a faster camera.", "Date": "October 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "Nikon Coolpix 5600 - Lots of Options, Limited Battery Life", "Author": "P. Gronwall", "ReviewID": "R3SPD5KKW2V32F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was attracted to the Nikon Coolpix 5600 by its price, extensive preset shooting modes, and compact size. It was put to the test on a one week vacation trip. The shooting modes were great - museum, sunset, night landscape, etc. And the size was handy. But there were two shortfalls. In one week, I went through two sets of batteries, taking a total of only 200 pictures. The second problem was the long time required to recharge before taking the next shot. It was a little annoying in daylight and painfully slow if I used the flash. Despite these two issues, it is an all around good camera.", "Date": "October 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "I Love it", "Author": "Abhijit Patnaik", "ReviewID": "R1LFFAGD77VJ68", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought it with the Viking 128 SD card offer for $235.

Pecot", "ReviewID": "R29Y47AKTFDUZ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got it for $[...]and now it is down to $[...]at Amazon and for that price I don't know how you could beat it. It is so small it will fit in your shirt pocket. I carry mine in a very small Walmart soft case that has a strong belt strap.  The case is thicker, but not larger than a cell phone case and there is room for extra batteries (which you will surely need) and an extra SD card. It comes without a SD card so I bought a 256mb card which will do 99 pics at the very highest qualitly setting on this 5.1 megapixel camera. You can double that by just dropping down to the default normal setting.  Same size print but more compression. With ordinary examination of the two settings, I can't tell the difference.  Maybe if you blow a picture up to 11 x 14 you could.  It has a 3:1 zoom but you can take advantage of the 5.1 mp and crop the picture which will result in a higher effective zoom ratio without losing any noticeable resolution. At the widest zoom setting it is really a wide angle, unlike some video cameras which only zoom from normal to telephoto. It looks to be about the equivalent of a 35mm wide angle lense on a 35mm camera.  The camera is a little small so watch your fingers when you shoot.  It is loaded with automatic features and the built in menus are very easy to use. I can verify some of the criticism about the battery usage and the shutter delay, especially the latter.  If you are doing flash shots of the grandbaby or the dog, you will get a lot of back-of-the-head shots because it takes about a second for the picture to set after you press the shutter. It also is hard on batteries if you use the flash frequently. I don't mind that much, because I buy the AA's by the dozens when they are on sale.  Rechargeables are a pain to use in my opinion.

The biggest problem is the slow flash recharge--6 seconds!  By then, if you're taking pictures of kids, they're long gone.  Also, you have to wait for the LCD to be ready to take the next picture.  You can turn the LCD off to save battery, but you have to go through 3 or 4 menu steps to do it, so it's not practical to switch off between using the LCD and not using it.  Finally, on some the fixed focus modes (landscape), which cuts down on shutter lag since the camera is not hunting for the autofocus, you can't use a flash.

Many were underexposed.

I wouldn't recommend this to you unless you have a very very steady hand--try it out in the store first and see if you are able to consistently take non-blurred pictures.

I have been nothing but disappointed with this Nikon.  Outdoors, the camera works fairly well, but indoors it's the pits.  No matter how much light you've got in your space, it will always flash, so people can appeared washed out.  On the flip side, the flash does not go very far, so photos can appear darker when you don't want that.  The biggest con to this camera is the insane amount of time it takes for the flash to recover.  I've counted it's 16 seconds, before it's ready to take another pic.  This is just unacceptable for Nikon, I expected much better.  No way can you expect your subjects to stand around and wait for this camera to ready itself between shots.  I have 2 small children, so we rarely get anything good from this camera, as they scoot away too quickly.  I agree with other reviewers, about the blurry hand always showing...and it being there makes it SO hard to snap a photo.  I deeply regret buying this item, and would not recommend it.

Sumstine \"Queenread\"", "ReviewID": "RQ2W11C3HT2JZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my Nikon Coolpix 5600 for a few years now.  I bought it just before a big deal family camping trip and I'm really glad I did.A couple years ago my (then 13) daughter, who is a bit clumsy and careless, precariously propped the camera on the mantle. Needless to say, it fell 3 feet hitting the woodstove, then two feet hitting the hearth then another two feet to the floor. I thought she'd have to forgo allowance for the rest of her life (I paid over $300 for it). The viewfinder was jammed in at an angle. I was able to pop it back into the proper position and the camera worked, but the zoom didn't work properly.  Well, over time (I never managed to take it into the camera shop) it has fixed itself. It's a magical self-healing camera. It works fine now.I wanted something small but handleable, easy to use with good quality pictures, and at the time I only had a cheap 35 mm auto type (really crummy) and a nice Nikon FG-50 with no flash (but such nice outdoor pictures!)This camera has so many options it's a little dizzying. It is also very intuitive and takes great pictures using just the factory settings. In fact, my (now 15) daughter tweaked the settings so much that somehow the camera could only take good pictures for her, and I got so frustrated that I reset the thing and now it takes good pictures for me again.I have to admit to not reading manuals unless I'm desperate or want to know about a specific thing (just love the index). This one has a pretty good manual. My daughter knows the different functions to tweak because she read the manual. (Me: Index, reset all, page 100)I have to admit that the flash recharge is slow, but I don't really use it that much. Also, you can use BSS which, by continuously pressing the picture taker button, allows you to take up to 10 photos at a time and then chooses the best one - and get this - uses museum mode. No flash to recharge. I just tried this with my daughter's cat in the closet. Each exposure takes a little longer than in a lighter room, but the picture came out really clear. (Of course the hyperactive kitten moved out of the shot, so it's a picture of boxes. (delete)) I read this in the manual and it really works ;-)Another option I like is the Sport mode. Great for taking soccer pictures . Again, no flash which means no need for slow recharge. Also in Sport with BSS you get all the pics you click continously, and you can choose the one(s) you want. (Set, kick, goal!)It comes with framing assist, scene assist, nice landscape and panorama assists. The thing I've sort of learned about a digital camera (and I don't have time to go to the classes and I am not a professional or even a hobbyist) is that it is so much more than just point and shoot.  I can point and shoot with that funky 35mm auto thing, but will the pictures come out nice? Maybe.  A digital camera has built in tools (and an external called a manual) to help the user make MORE quality pictures. Why would anyone use a flash for a soccer picture? Night game? Indoor soccer?. Actually we took some pics at a night game and they turned out okay, but I'm just an okay photographer- And it was before I discovered BSS.I realize NOT EVERY SHOT WILL BE GREAT, but isn't that why you have a digital? (besides the computer sharing thing..) You can delete the ones you don't want! The picture viewing/delete option is great!  Also in view mode you can zoom in on the detail to see if aunt Sylvia was smiling or not and then retake if necessary.  It's also handy for deleting all those really stupid teen-age mugging pictures before they get downloaded to the computer. (Kissing the camera again?!)The camera comes with a computer package which I didn't really like, so I uninstalled it and just use Irfanview (freeware). Of course now that I have XP (oh yeah, welcome to the 3rd millenium!) and a new fancy HP printer I've got these other options too, but we like Irfanview.  You don't need software to download the pictures to the computer, just the included USB cable. Go to My Computer, find the drive the camera is, open it and transfer your pics to your document file. (My son in law showed me this (no, not the 15 year old, her sister) pretty handy, this younger generation.)This is not the perfect camera. It is a really good mid-range digital. Better than a cheap one, not as good as an DSLR (wouldn't that be nice). This camera gets better as you know it better.  And it won't die on you when you drop it from 5 feet onto the hard ground.", "Date": "November 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "great outdoor, but not with the flash", "Author": "Shen", "ReviewID": "R2FEZD9B3PJNEC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this about 18months ago when it first came out.  At the time, the cheapest I can find with a discount was about $260.  Price was, I thought it was fair.  Looking at them now, it's still a good bargain...for a reason I later found out.  As a novice user of cameras, I bought it mostly because of the name Nikon as I wanted something that was well known.  Thus far, the camera has functioned as new w/o any problem.  It is well built, small size, and the pictures taken in 5m have great detail, especially looking at it on computer.OK..the reason for the 2 star is the time it takes to recharge the flash.  Search around, and you'll see that as a major complaint for this camera.  On the average, it takes a good 5-6 seconds for flash to recharge.  With my 2 kids, it's next to impossible for them to sit that long.  I tried different batteries as well, and it's all the same wait.  For outdoors, bright light, the pictures are great.  But for indoor, or shady area, the flash will come on automatically and it's just a pain for the time to recharge.Again, that is the only problem in my book, but it's a major problem.  Because of it, both my wife and I will be looking at new camera soon, and it won't be a Nikon.  We'll probably give it to my son to play with.

I quickly upgraded to the 5600 because it had a microphone so I'd get sound when recording videos. It seems the 4600 is pretty much a dumbed down 5600 (and a slightly smaller pixel size -- but who cares? I never print larger than 4x6, so I always use a reduced image size). BTW, My parents have the 3600 which does have video with sound.**** ALL **** Point-And-Shoot cameras have the following difficulties:* Shutter delay after you take a picture (you have to wait while the image is read from the CCD, processed, and saved to memory)* Quickly drains battery power if you use the flash and have the LCD screen on the brightest setting (so don't do it! I hardly use the flash and leave the LCD screen at half brightness level).* There's a delay in charging the flash, and the LCD might turn off while it's doing it.  That's because Nikon is trying to save your batteries... but all cheap cameras basically have this problem.  However the Nikon may be a bit worse...* you should always use rechargeable batteries with digital cameras* there are lots of ignorant reviewers which flood the reviews preventing you from getting to the information you really want, which is:So why buy one over another? Some have slightly better delays, but more importantly look out for consistent problems, e.g., some Canon PowerShot's seem to have a problem with the lens shutter sticking.I've had my 5600 for over a year now and everything has been great. However, it has succumbed to a problem that a few other consumers have mentioned, it powers on and takes one picture, and only one picture. Then you have to cycle power.I'm in the process of either getting another 5600 or some other cheap (~$100) camera with video+audio.  I will buy a 5600 if I can't find an SD compatible camera for this price without other problems.  All-in-all the 5600 is a good camera, it does what 90% of people taking pictures need, as long as they aren't stupid about it.Don't let the general complaints I itemized above trouble you -- the people that make them are ignorant of how a digital camera works, don't bother listening to a word they say. If you want a really fast camera go for a SLR (or go film!), but it'll cost you... If you want a cheap camera, then buy a cheap camera (like this one), but don't complain about it having a slow response time, or the flash taking a long time to recharge, or the pictures being blurry (learn how to stand still, i.e., stop drinking coffee and smoking dope).Get with the program people.End of rant.", "Date": "February 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "AnnieM", "ReviewID": "R2RDAC5V2FC7J7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just picked up this camera at a rummage sale.

It has a lot of different lighting options, like party mode, and fireworks and skiing and action and so forth, but they just don't seem to work well.  The action one gives a very grainy picture, whiel the party modes give a red underexposed picture.  I miss my Minolta Dimage!  I used my girlfriend's Sony Cybershot 7.2 megapixel and LOVED it.

If you take the batteries off, it seems it is a toy camera). I used it during a week I spent in New York, and I have to congratulate Nikon for its nice camera. It has a great long lasting battery, because I took 900 photos, what means an average of 150 photos per day, and I had to charge it every night.The special functions for some situations (like fireworks, photos inside museums, panoramic photos) are awesome too, and I was very surprised.But, of course, the camera has its bad points. The Best Shot Selector (BSS) is not that nice, and I suggest you to take pictures without it. Other tip is not use the Museum function - if you are taking photos in a dark place in the museum and without a tripod or such that thing your pictures will become awful, it seems that you are taking photos in an earthquake. If you are in these conditions, it'd better if you use the normal photo function, but without the flash. The photos will be a lot better, and if they are not nice at least the ask you to erase it =)!I suggest you to buy with no remorse.

The flash recovery time takes forever and it does not matter if you change the battery settings. It takes a ton of blurred pics which is very fustrating because you have to constanlty retake photos. All of the extra settings on the camera such as fireworks, indoor/party, beach, etc...do nothing to enhance the quality of pics taken in those light conditions. The camera works better when no flash is required and you can keep your hand as steady as possible and continue to hold the camera steady after the pic is taken. Please do not waste your money on this digital camera. There are many others to choose from that will take high quality photos with less headaches.

I did a little online research, and people seemed to say good things about the Nikon Coolpix series, so I decided to buy one.Well, to test it out, I spent a week taking pictures, and I had some friends take pictures with it too.  By the end of the week, I had nearly 500 pictures, and about 2/3rds of them were blurry!  There was one instance where I tried taking a picture of a flower (a nice, non-moving target), and I took 12 pictures of it using different setitngs and trying different distances, and every single one of them came out blurry.  I had a friend I was with try too, just to make sure it wasn't something I was doing wrong, and she couldn't get any pictures to come out clear either.In addition to this, there is also the slow flash recharge time.  It seemed like by the time the picture was done being recorded and the flash had recharged, 10 seconds had gone by.  This might not sound like a long time, but if you are trying to take multiple shots of something, it becomes quite frustrating.  And if you don't use the flash, pictures are more likely to turn out dark and blurry, even if you are outside on a bright, sunny day.  The action mode is about worthless because of this.  Sure, it lets you take pictures quickly, but not a single one of the pictures I took using the action mode came out clear.I tried to give this camera a fair shot...I kept it for a week even though I could tell by the first day I wasn't thrilled with it.  But finally I had to take it back. (I got a Sony Cybershot instead, and I am a LOT happier with it.)", "Date": "July 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not what I expected from a Nikon", "Author": "M. Patrick", "ReviewID": "R2SU90BAS64ISM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera without much knowledge of it, basing my trust on the Nikon brand. It is a decent little point and shoot camera, but I found 3 main flaws with it that I'm having a hard time getting over.1. Pictures blur incredibly easy.  It's very difficult to hold the camera still enough on most settings to get a clear picture. I have found one setting, which is the portrait setting, that will give a crisp clear picture, but uses a multi flash system which is time consuming.2. Camera shuts down for flash recharging  After taking a picture that uses the flash, the camera will very briefly display the taken picture but will then go completely blank, causing you to not be able to do anything including simply review the picture, until the flash has finished charging. (this ends up taking apprx. 13 seconds before being able to be reused)3. Pictures do not reorient themselves in the camera  After turning the camera to take a portrait shot (as opposed to landscape) the camera saves the picture as taken. Therefore, when viewing the pictures on your computer or tv, they are not vertical. Easily fixed with editing, but if you are looking for a quick way to display the pictures upright, you'll have to only take shots with the camera in the correct angle. Otherwise a transfer and resaving after flipping the picture is necessary.", "Date": "November 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Two years of misery", "Author": "Faerie at Heart", "ReviewID": "R13CO5VUHFZR10", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this camera as a gift on my birthday two years ago.

I bought the Nikon because I needed a camera right away and wanted to spend about $200 and the Nikon seemed to fit the bill. I have to say I liked the Canon better. I didn't buy the camera on Amazon but instead bought it at a local camera shop.  What the salesman promised and what the camera delivers are two different things.  The Nikon is smaller and fits into my pocket book, backpack, or even my pocket really well but the picture quality is not what I would expect from a 5.1 megapixel camera.  Also the shutter speed on this thing is ridiculous.  If you want to take several pictures in a row using the flash forget it because it takes about 30 seconds to recharge after it uses the flash.  Shutter speed without the flash is several seconds also.  I have also found that the \"exposure settings\" don't work very well.  Every time I use them the pictures come out discolored, blurry or something else so its not worth using them.  The battery life is supposed to be really good too but I have found that I go through batteries like crazy so rechargeable batteries are a must with this camera.  The one thing that I do like about this camera is the video.  For a camera it takes quality videos with sound, which is a nice addition.
