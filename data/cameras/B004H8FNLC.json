{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Slight victory of form over function", "Author": "Real Raleigh Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R1O64E06MS8CJ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "With such a broad variety of nice point-and-shoot cameras in this price range one gets to be picky, and a couple of relatively minor things is all that's wrong with this camera. I am a pretty big Sony fan and own, or have owned, many items from them - headphones, laptops, cameras, and of course, PSP and PS3. This one is a bit of a let-down. Not a BAD camera, just clearly not the best, and clearly not up to the standard of Sony quality and construction. Here's why:- The marketing photos look cooler than the camera does in person. The rear of the case is dark gray plastic; only the front half is silver.- The shutter release button is a small, low-profile rectangle. Every other camera ever made has a circular shutter release that protrudes from the top, making it very easy to locate without looking for it. This one is smooth and low-profile so it's not as easy to just blindly grab and shoot. I just can't fathom why they would have made a button that's harder to locate by touch...- Untrue to Sony's standard, the body feels light-weight and plasticy. The buttons (power, shutter release, zoom) feel kind of loosely fitted not solid and firm. Very un-Sony-like.- The flash is overpowering for subjects up close. Subjects across the room (or the room itself) turn out pretty good colors with flash on.- The battery life is truly abysmal. I took around 50 test pictures and one short (<15s) video and found that a fully-charged, brand-new battery was completely flat dead. I'm hoping this was some fluke with the first charge of the battery or something, although I haven't observed that in other cameras.But does it take good pictures?Yes!Focus works well even while zoomed all the way in. Image stabilization works brilliantly. Low-light images turn out pretty well - obviously you need a steady hand and it won't take a sharp picture of a crazy kid chasing the dog across the room with only table lamps on, but if the kid stops for a second, you can get a good pic. Colors are very life-like. In pictures taken outside, I got about 19/20 clear and sharp and the one that wasn't sharp was only because it snapped a second photo while I was taking the camera down to put in my pocket - so, essentially 100% sharp clear focus as long as you're pointing at the thing you want a picture of. Indoors I'd say about 2/3 of the pictures came out perfectly clear in very low, incandescent light with no flash.It's so-so because of the aforementioned form factor issues and dreadful battery life. Taking good pictures is meaningless if the thing goes through 2 or 3 batteries in a single afternoon outing. I'll revise my rating up to 4/5 if in subsequent use I find that the thing has more acceptable battery life; but, fewer than 100 pictures is just crazy. On other point-and-shoot cameras, even some where there are complaints about battery life, I've been able to take 200+ pictures, half indoors w/ flash and half outdoor with zoom heavily used, and 5-10 minutes of video, and the battery still indicates full charge. This issue alone could be a deal-breaker for this otherwise OK camera.==============Revising the review up from 3 to 4 stars. Although the first use did have a fully-charged battery, the same battery, as well as the backups I bought, do appear to deliver a more standard, expected usage in the camera - several hundreds of photos over a couple of weeks. Glad that that was just a new-battery fluke!", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good value for the money", "Author": "trhouse", "ReviewID": "R1YXHJN2Z41PWH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to disagree with some of these reviews regarding the build quality of this Sony. I have owned HP, an Olympus, two previous Sony's, two Nikon's, and two Canon's. They were all 100% plastic bodies like the DSCW570. I carried them in pants pockets or a shoulder bag. Some were dropped more than a few times onto garage or concrete floors. None including this Sony ever suffered any damage because of the plastic case.If they broke, it was inside. The Nikon was dropped and the lens failed to extend. An earlier Sony became intermittent. They were sold or given away on Craigslist or BCKS. I carry this Sony in my pants pocket along with a cell phone. It has never been a problem.I went away from Sony before because I was tired of paying a lot for their proprietary media sticks but there were features of those Sony's I always liked. For example, the infrared focusing beam allows composing in total darkness something my HP, Olympus, and Nikon's could not do. I liked a feature which showed up in my second Canon. It automatically would switch to Macro mode when necessary and would automatically select a Scene mode in Auto mode. In Program mode, it allowed adjusting the exposure, metering method (spot, central area, multi-area), etc. The Sony does the same.All the other cameras were 3 to 1 optical zooms or less with similar f stop range to the 570 so I see nothing unusual about that. Some would automatically switch to digital zoom so it was necessary to watch out for that happening. The 570 does not do that. One of the earlier cameras had a battery compartment door switch which caused it to open when sliding it into your pants. I would reach for the camera and end up with a handful of batteries. The 570 does not do that either.Some cameras have the flash near the upper left side of the camera unlike the 570 which has it in the middle. I used to accidentally put a finger over part of the flash when holding the camera with two hands. That does not happen with the 570.What could be improved is that the electrical connector on the bottom of the camera is completely exposed unlike some cameras which have a rubber cover over it. I also miss the optical viewfinder that the Canon's had but they were larger cameras. A very nice feature is that the manual is actually stored in the camera. That feature was not in any of my older cameras. The written manual is pretty worthless since the camera's internal manual contains more information. The information does not entirely overlap. For example, the information about how many photos per battery charge is in the printed manual but not in the camera but the camera contains the information about all the onscreen icons.I also like the feature that you can review the photos in the camera without using the on/off switch which extends the lens. Just hit the review button and the screen comes on without the lens opening. By the time I count \"one\", \"two\" the image is up. Another feature not available in my older cameras is the ability to review photos by date. The 570 can display a calendar, you select the date, it shows the photos from that date.Some of my previous cameras had a battery low warning indicator but by the time it gave a warning, the batteries were about gone. The 570 indicator gives a more precise indication in bars like a cell phone signal strength indicator.Panoramic mode has been available on other cameras for awhile. It is not a feature I found worth while in any camera. I think this is a perfectly satisfactory product which has been trouble free and a pleasure to use.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a good value for the price (cheap cheap cheap build quality)", "Author": "Gregory A. Henry \"atlantagreg\"", "ReviewID": "R1714Z7P5ARSYG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I picked up a DSC-W570 recently at \"a major discount warehouse chain\" (actually, Amazon is cheaper on the price, though). I paid $179.00 for the bundle.The camera was blister packed with the camera, case, memory card, and basic accessories that included a USB cable, software, wrist strap, and battery/charger. When you look at this camera even up close, it almost appears to have a metal body, which would have been great.  Unfortunately, once you unpack it, you realize it's plastic - and not just any standard grade of plastic, but EXTREMELY cheap, \"toy-grade\" plastic.  It stands to reason that these days most of the sub-$200 cameras are going to be made of plastic, but this really did feel like a toy, even once the small battery was installed to add a little weight to it.  I handed it to several coworkers who commented, \"Oh, is this for children?\", and were shocked when I told them it was $179.00.That aside, with battery charged, I tested the camera out and I'll just go over a few of the very basics here.  The camera is small enough to fit into a pocket, though due to the build quality I'd be tempted not to do it as it could easily break.  The 5X zoom lens extends from the body quickly and does features an optical image stabilization (I.S.) system which I would rate as \"so-so effective\", due to the fact the lens has a maximum aperture of around 6.2/6.3 when you're fully zoomed; this means it takes in much less light when zoomed, and unless you have excellent light, the camera has to use a slower shutter speed to get the shot.  Even outdoors on a sunny day but in shade, and even with I.S., the camera produced several blurry shots due to this. The LCD screen is of a lower resolution but still usable for composing shots, though it's a bit hard to see in sunlight - there is no optical viewfinder due to the small size of the camera.One of the selling features of this camera is the \"sweep panorama\" mode, where you aim at a scene to the left, press the shutter, and move the camera to the right; the camera will then \"stitch\" several images together to make a long panoramic shot. The pano shots are lower in resolution however, and while good for using online or for very small prints, can't be enlarged well.  Also, the camera does not adjust for lighting variations, so during the left-to-right \"sweep\", if part of your subject is in brighter light than the rest, it will most likely be completely washed out in the finished photo.  The pano only works left-to-right, and you cannot use it vertically (up and down) for that type of pano, as the camera will give you an error message.  You can make adjustments in the menu system to things like image size (in megapixels), exposure compensation, focusing, and even spot metering, but other more basic things are not available such as image quality (normal/fine/super fine) found on almost all other camera models.  The 720p video feature actually takes halfway decent video indoors in well lit areas, but outdoors in bright sun, colors appear washed out/faded, and the level of detail is fairly blurry (though you can use the zoom during movie recording).  Battery life was average, as it's a tiny battery, so you'll need a spare for all day shooting.  Overall image quality was \"so so\", and the 16 megapixel size of the pics mean next to nothing really on this size of camera as it's a very tiny chip inside that does the capture.  When viewed close, the images typically have more of a watercolorish look to them, and if you crank up the iso (light sensitivity) past the lowest numbers, this effect gets much worse, very quickly.Honestly, if this camera were in the $99-$109 range, I would complain much less about it's shortcomings, and especially the incredibly cheesy build quality.  But with retail prices in the $149-$179 range for this unit, I'd say there are better offerings for that price from Canon, Olympus, or even Casio in terms of build quality.  Fuji has a very similar model to this Sony that sells retail for around $119.00.  I'm not a photography newbie, and I know what you should reasonably expect from a camera compared to it's price point - and this model is just far too \"cheap\" in quality to warrant spending the money for it unless there's a significant price drop.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fun and easy to use", "Author": "Space", "ReviewID": "RJQKE1PGM8Q84", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": null, "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love It", "Author": "Noel Evilsizor", "ReviewID": "R2D8NHW28JAHYT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera, Great photos, but the zoom could better.

It's got a nice zoom and is compact.I have an Olympus DLSR and use this camera for mostly candids and times when I don't want to risk my DSLR to injury.  I tried it in 4 national parks in the southwest and was disappointed.  The focus was too soft on many of the shots.  To it's credit, it's quick to focus and locks onto many points.  The problem is that when you review your shots, you can see the focus across the depth of field is often not acceptable.  Other times it is just fine.  Yes, this isn't a DSLR and you can't dial it up to 22 for a nice canyon...  At least the zoom is good and the steady shot works well.The biggest issue is exposure.  Shooting in the bright southwest required manually dialing down the exposure a lot.  A camera with this much intelligent programming should have dealt with that better.Indoors, I tried flash off, well lit room still life.  I was disappointed with the result.  The indoor candids were sub par.  I think the issue here is noise.  Sony stuffed 16mp onto a small sensor, and of course that introduces noise.  You are trading portability for noise with this camera.I was disappointed to see that this camera does not have dedicated macro mode, but instead a smart macro.  Booo!  I use the camera at work to take super close up pictures and it is frustrating.  I find myself using my old sony S52 (which actually produces superior low light and macro pics, believe it or not).The video was fine.  I tried the panorama, and it worked fine most of the time.  I tried it at the top of a few mountains with good result.  I tried it at niagara falls on a boat with mediocre to poor results, due to rocking ship.  The stitching can leave obvious lines.The build quality feels mediocre, especially when compared to older Sony compact camera's I've used at work.  I will say that the camera was exposed to moisture on the maid of the mist at Niagara and fared well... so give it credit.  The shutter button is hard to hit half-way and there is some processing lag after some shots.  Battery life was not great, even with flash off.  At least the screen is usually readable, even in bright light.My fiancee has the direct competitor Canon PowerShot ELPH 100 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 4X Optical Zoom (Grey) and I found that to be a better overall camera.

Forget about the time you had to take several pictures and then match them on some software or more recently when we had to be very careful about the end of one frame and the begining of the next one. With this option you only have to move the camera from one side to another without even caring about the shaking of your hand! Haha!Another good thing is that the video quality is great and it doesnt seem like it has a limit of time per video recording. I used this camera to film an entire photoshoot and it worked awesome. The only thing I didnt like is that you have to be very careful when you are recording a video and moving at the same time (even just walking) because the image shakes too much and Im very good at that so I was kind of surprised when I saw the video on my computer.Now, the next thing may be a very good thing for most of you but for me not at all. This camera is soooo easy to use that it only has 3 options: pictures, panoramic and video. You only can take pictures in automatic mode, they left nothing to the creativity of photographers. Some digital cameras gives you the option of taking pictures in macro, night portraits, fireworks and some others but with this camera you cant do anything more than take automatic pictures. So pretty much the camera decides everything for you. It may be awesome for people who dont know anything about photography but for amateurs and professionals (even just curious users) it is a very limited use.Also, I think the zoom may be highly improved in nexts cybershots because it is almost as if you didnt have a zoom!Last thing. I guess the flash is just too weak, because I was in a concert and I just couldnt take any picture of the show because it was completely dark and since it doesnt have any other option than automatic... You can imagine I just lost my time trying to take a picture there.If you are going to use this camera in good lighting conditions and you are only interested in taking nice pictures without trying to do something special or different, then it is perfect for you.

It auto-adjusts to the surrounding, pictures look crisp and clean and it remembers your settings.

For instance, if you take 9 pictures in a few hours, when reviewing them it was label them as 1-9, the next time you take a picture the numbering process will begin again. I find it a handy way to separate when showing off the pictures, especially if they're similar.2 complaints:1, its rechargeable battery does die quickly. The camera comes with a 15% off coupon that I'd recommend using to buy a spare battery or a quick charge device.2, the viewing screen is a glossy flat screen and fingerprints show up easily on it.

ANd if you know what you're doing, you can fiddle with all kinds of controls in the other modes. There are also a ton of different scenes (which as far as I can tell are subtle focus and lighting effects) to take pictures of food, pets, people, fireworks, landscape, underwater, and many more. There are also different settings for smile detection, red eye guard, different facial focusing, etc. The panoramic mode is very fun and easy to use, allowing you to take wide, long shots. Unlike other cameras I've seen with this mode, you simply hold down the button and move the camera, as opposed to taking multiple shots and blending the pictures together.

They also wanted the same amount to repair the camera as it sold for. I was furious and contacted customer Relations and only was able to get the camera returned to me broken. Sony does not stand behind there warranty, and this camera is not well built. I only used it for my grandchildren visits which were 4 visits.

The Macro is awesome, and it automatically switches to that when you are close enough to whatever you are shooting.  It has a setting that automatically takes pictures when it detects smiles, which kinda weirds me out, but you can totally turn that off.  And it has a pink display setting which makes me happy because my other camera was pink and I was a little sad that I couldn't get one that same color.  I have the black one, and it is shimmery/glittery which I also love so it's all good.  Another feature that is really cool is the panorama setting.  You just hit the shutter button, and move the camera to the right and it takes multiple frames and makes one long picture.  So cool!

That means I actually remember to carry it with me often* Easy and quick to take photographs - goes from OFF to photo-ready in nearly 1-2 seconds* Takes good photos with little effort - the easy mode is sufficient for me. There are more selectable modes but I have never needed themHere is what some may not like:* If you are worried that this camera is too delicate, buy a padded bag for it. The Costco package came with one and thats all I have needed to carry it in my pocket* There are numerous 'easy' modes - not sure why a camera needs so many - but if you don't like the 'easy' mode then there is another 'iAuto' or you could just use the 'selectable' modes (the list keeps going)* If you want more control on your shot, buy a different camera - I can't tell if this camera provides anySome have mentioned a few competing cameras that are cheaper and I tried 3 similar cameras in this price range before settling on the DSC-W570.

Also - there's a great feature where in lowlight, it will take 2 pictures (if you choose this option) - one with a flash and one without and you can choose which is the best - LOVE IT.I take a ton of food pictures (yes, I 'm one of THOSE people) and it even has a setting for food pictures! I haven't had one blurry picture yet (I always did with the Samsung).I haven't tried the video recorder because I didn't buy it with intention of using it - so I really can't comment on that.I love that the on/off button is very tiny and flush with the camera - that way it won't accidentally turn on when you throw it in your bag and then when you want to take a picture -- you discover the battery is dead (another problem with my other camera).So yes, I love it. So glad I bought it - easy to understand and navigate the menu and takes great pictures.

Although the camera on my phone is nice, it really is awful at night and you can only do adjustments once the picture has been taken.  This has more than made up for it and at this point I have no complaints.I opted for the black as they had black and silver on display (and they had pink in stock).  The black just looked nicer to me and I would be able to tell it apart from my old Nikon at a glance (it is silver, though also big and bulky so it probably would not have mattered).  The size is a good size in that I can fit it in most of my pockets - something that will be good come summer when I go on vacation.  The screen is very nice and crisp.  So far all the features like panoramic have been simple to use and have good results.Generally I go for Canons just as a preference, but looking at the specs for all the basic Canon and even Nikon cameras on display, for the price this was the best and so far I've been beyond pleased with it (even more so because I was spending store credit).I don't know if I would have bought it for 165 like the current price on Amazon, but for the 100 I paid it is a great buy for something you want to take nice pictures with.

I have spent over eight hours today going over both sets of printed data and the in-camera guide menus with the actual camera menus.  There are numerous instances of missing, misleading  and incorrect information. Instruction manual & user guide both are frequent misleading and in places factually inaccurate; neither are identical with each other and neither are identical to the internal 'In Camera Guide' -- which in turn does not match the detailed settings and their hierarchy within the actual'Menu.'Basic simple user data is missing -- for example how to physically remove the battery without probing inside the device or applying an inappropriate degree of force; the first attempt took 15 minutes, once you know how of course it's a matter of 10 seconds! The battery needs re-charging after about 2 hours if you are simply going through the menu's and loaded guides trying to discover and set and use the various functions. I would suggest buying a second battery for anything but the most occasional 'point and shoot' use.The viewer is large -- however despite appearances and claims it is not wysiwyg; the center of the image is fine but you can never be exactly certain precisely where the actual image file edge will be, therefore for other than the most casual of snapshots all images will have to be tidied in an image editor to ensure decent basic composition.  Also, the viewer only gives an approximation and does not in my opinion show accurately the combined impact of any ISO and lens settings for depth of field etc.As a piece of equipment seems good value for money, providing you neglect the many hours of time you will have to spend, because of the poor instruction sets, playing with the camera working out exactly how all but the most basic functions interrelate.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Ash", "ReviewID": "R3F8INF5GTNALM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just recently bought this camera at a department store for $179.00. I really wished I did some research on it before buying. I was very upset when I got home and opened the box to find it didnt come with a memory card or even a case for it. I bought the camera for 4th of july weekend and found it to be extremely slow. It's really slow when I want to shut it off and on. After taking a picture when I want to go back and view the picture it takes atleast 10 seconds before you can get to see it. Its really annoying. I agree with everyone it was very poorly made.

My biggest disappointment is the battery life. Out last point and shoot (Canon Power Shot) seemed to last through 3-4 events without dying out. The Sony seems to be more comparable to a smartphone battery life. It is not quite as bad as most smart phones, but I've had to train myself to charge this battery after every event after having it die early on several occasions. I also had issues importing pictures. I use a pretty standard SD card. The first batch of pictures I imported were mysteriously lost. (This is also using a brand new laptop with windows 7). I was forced to use an off-the-shelf data restoring program to save the pictures. now I don't trust the camera to import, I just take out the SD card and plug it into the computer. I suppose this could be an isolated incident, but I'd rather be safe.
