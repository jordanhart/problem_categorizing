{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera get it", "Author": "rmalone", "ReviewID": "R2IH0ZZFCSQX94", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera if you need high speed and in low light, I love mine as for a pocket size camera and with great micro you just can't go wrong. The shipper was really fast to get it to me from Japan as quick as they do. The shipper I believe is called Asuka ( hope I spelled that right) but they really know how to package the camera so it would not get damaged. It did not come with English info book but it's no big deal as the shipper tells you were to download the manual in english, and also walks you threw tuning it on and getting the camera reading in English so that was no problem for the money you save buying from them I had no problem living with a small detail like downloading English manual, plus I opened it and they had sent me two sets of chop sticks new from Jaan which was a nice thing for them to do. I really don't think I could have gotten it faster in the states threw amazon as I did from them. They really rock as far as shipping and answering questions you may have. They even paid my import fee for you. Great company I'll order again from them if I need any thing else that they sell threw amazon.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great little cam", "Author": "OC_", "ReviewID": "R3U0JV0SK4XJBG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Does everything very well.
