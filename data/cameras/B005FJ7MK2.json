Also, the size is a big plus. The downside is that it performs quite badly in low light - it really gives a very noisy picture, to the point of triggering the dvr motion sensitivity continuously.Still, for the money, and with the caveats mentioned, a solid buy.PS: Does anyone know if it is possible to replace the lens, and if so, what mount this is?", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not as good as expected", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R1RYMERDYL46YH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Arrived very fast and in good packaging.Not sure it is 520 TVL though as resolution appears lower than other 380 TVL cameras.Buyers need to be aware it is a 5V device, my other cameras operate on a 12V line, this will kill this camera if connected.Not suitable for outdoor use as camera is not sealed in any way.On the good side, the colors seem true.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wrong power supply; two of three not working; no service", "Author": "Norbert Simonis", "ReviewID": "ROK0MXSFOJ2EK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered three of these.  One of the three came with a power supply that had too small of a male connector.  Not realizing that the DVC was different from my other cameras, I used one of those power supplies and apparently burned out the camera since the DVC was 10 instead of 5.  The company did not respond to my e-mail about the problem.  The second one quit shortly after getting it going.  I'm pleased with the third one, but I paid the price of three to get one that works.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Save your money!", "Author": "TVLOCO", "ReviewID": "R3JJ0C7613GM4H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have cameras with 380 lines of resolution that look better than this piece of junk.It's also closer to black & white than it is to COLOR.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$86.00", "Features": "With Light Weight & Mini Size, Easy to Install Into Covert Narrow Space and Slim Tube, etc. without Causing Unnecessary Damage On Object Surface.\nMiniature Covert Shape, Light Weight, 3.7mm F2.0/55 Degrees View Angle, Power Supply, Input: AC 100V ~ 240V, 50 ~ 60 Hz, Output: DC 5V, 1000mA.\nImage Sensor: 1/3\" CMOS Image Sensor.
