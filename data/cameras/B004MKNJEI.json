{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT underwater/MACRO camera", "Author": "qbc1899", "ReviewID": "R2TAT4VTV29RWE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this product for an upcoming trip to Hawaii and wanted a camera with underwater capability.  I also bought the Panasonic Lumix TS3 to compare and ended up returning it.  I am happy with my choice to keep the Pentax.Here is what I liked:The durability and the rugged feel of this camera right away impressed me.  I felt like I was holding a camera that wouldn't break if I dropped it or tossed it into my purse.  It was exactly what I needed for an outdoor/adventure trip.  I was most excited to try out the Macro capabilities of this camera.  They were among the first shots I took.  All I can say is that they were amazing.  Far and away, the quality was better than anything I have seen for a Point and Shoot camera.  I could see individual bits of pollen when shooting a flower or individual pores on my finger.  Even when I blew the images up and zoomed in, the clarity was amazing.Once I got onto my trip, I used the camera underwater in various depths, from 3 feet of water to 250 (although I did not go down that far, this camera is only waterproof to 30 feet).  The clarity of the images while zooming in in deep in water was great.  I took a picture of a puffer fish that was close to 100 feet below me in 250 feet of water and the image turned out.  I took pictures of sharks, dolphins, fish and coral.  The pictures are clear and vibrant.  The macro setting on some of the coral is to die for.  I was so impressed with how these turned out.  Had no problems with the camera being waterproof.  After each underwater adventure (lasting from 20 minutes to two hours in the water, diving up to 20-25 feet deep for some pictures), I rinsed the camera with clean water and let it air dry before I opened any compartments.  The color quality is spot on, no weird colors turning up.  It is true to eye.  The buttons are also easy to use and change to the best setting (outside, underwater, macro, auto, sport, etc).  All of my pictures in daylight and soft light turned out great.  The large screen on the back makes viewing pictures easy.  The self-portrait assist was a cool idea and worked great.Negatives:The only thing that I was NOT impressed with on this camera was low light (nighttime, inside)/no light (nighttime, outside) conditions.  Whenever it was dark out, the pictures often turned out blurry, even with the flash on.  I may have had it on the wrong setting, because some of them turned out great, but others, not so great.  Or it may have been user error (whenever I took the pictures, they generally turned out fine, the ones that are blurry tend to be when I asked random people to take a picture of me).  I didn't play around with the settings at night too much mostly because I had a DSLR camera with me that I used in those conditions.  I did take a lot of sunset pictures that turned out great on this camera.  But once the sun was down....not so much.  Also, I went for a night dive with this camera, the underwater camera is useless at night because the flash captures particles in the water and with no flash it's too blurry.  However, the underwater video recorder worked great at night.Overall, this is a great camera for it's price.  The camera performs well under most conditions.  I lugged it around on a dusty six mile hike, underwater, running, and everything else you can imagine.  The camera is easy to wash off, waterproof and has a FANTASTIC macro ability that I have never seen on a point and shoot camera before.  If you are expecting this to be a DSLR, remember that this is a POINT AND SHOOT camera.  Even so, some of the pictures rivaled my DSLR camera.  I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very entertaining WG-1", "Author": "Dustin Geurts \"dustin geurts\"", "ReviewID": "R13LRNGCA29UIC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Check out my updating youtube videos. I am user: \"PentaxWG1\" The good the bad the ugly. The over all feel of this camera is strong and gripable. I love having metal and rubber on my electronics. I have dropped this camera. It was on my lap in the jeep and there was a hornet. I jumped out and it threw to the ground. No problems. The removable circle around the lens (macro stand) has threads. They are 46mm and can screw on filters and caps. I got a cap, uv filter, polorized filter, and flourecent filter on e-bay for $6. So other than the sony TX10, this is the only camera that can protect the lens. Can't wait to buy a telescopic lens. My camera has been underwater about 15 ft. I've seen no problems with leaking. It has two openeings; one for battery and sd card, and one for hd/av hook-up. Both seem strong and sturdy to me. Battery cover does move ever so slightly but seems fine. Ok, thats the construction. As you have already heard, the macro/super macro is awesome. If you can get your specimen to sit still, you can get some pretty great material. The movie macro is even pretty cool, but you have to stay at a consistant focal length or it gets blury. I recorded a wolf spider in pitch black and the l.e.d. lights around the lens made it look like a monster movie! One bad thing about the macro is that when set straight down on the subject it will focus and take the picture on something as flat as a leaf or picture.... if it protrudes as much as a dime width or more it won't stay focused. But when I pulled back just a hair the dime did look awsome. N-E-Wayz, It seems the closer you are to the subject with this camera the better it looks. A closer shot of two people, shoulders and up, look really good. But further away not so much. pictures of groups of people (full body) or the shot of a pond or a... cow...I say the camera is about par. Not bad but not great. I have tried the cybershot TX10 and if you strictly want waterproof picture quality go that way or panasonic. TX10 was beautiful but not as fun. Back to the WG-1. With par pics I do feel the camera is more consistant than its predesessor w90. Better with stand, free hand not as good..but always the same. Never a crappy picture out of nowhere. I also feel it does much better in lower light than the w90. It gets noisey but I was getting decent lighted shots (no flash) in areas that where very dim to the naked eye. The l.e.d. lights are handy, too. Optical zoom works pretty well for pictures. You'll want a steady hand or stand if zoomed all the way in. Digital zoom sucks. The panorama is not sweep. You take 3 pics and line them up, then the camera stitches them. Not as convinient as the TX10 but it looks good and you can do tricks...As for underwater. Pictures and video where pretty darn good. Anti shake or wudever made it pretty smooth. With video underwater or above the zoom works but it doesn't refocus very well. But over all regular video was better than I expected. Once again when things are close it seems very virbrant. I got about a foot from a cow's face and the fur on his head got very HiDef-ish. Battery life....sucks, but I got and extra generic one when I ordered mine for 6 bucks. Over-all I really love this camera. I've been totally entertained for 2 days and havn't even gotten to time lapse phtography yet. Although I do think of the pic quality of the TX10 now and then. I would have been bored with that camera after one dip in the lake. I can get a 10 mp zoom camera for less than a hundred and fill in anywhere the wg-1 lack.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do not waste your money on this camera", "Author": "lolligag", "ReviewID": "R1ELRTFECJUG4U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We owned a Pentax's first waterproof camera (Optio W10) and loved it. So when it came time to upgrade we bought this one before our trip to Mexico. We choose this one because of its ergonomic design. We figured this would work wonders when splashing around underwater and be easy to hold onto. The ergonomic design is the only redeeming feature of this camera.At first we were concerned about how loose the battery door was. The battery door stayed shut but it would slide partially open when closed and was very loose (not enough for water to actually get in but enough to make us concerned). Thinking it might just be the camera we picked up, we went back to the store where we bought it from. After looking at other ones it appears to be part of the design. This should have been our first clue that this is a horrible camera.While on vacation in Mexico the camera froze several times requiring the battery to be removed to get it to unfreeze. Now this can be a true problem when you need to let the camera dry for about an hour before opening the battery door otherwise you risk exposing both the battery and memory card to water.We also discovered small water spots on the inside of the display screen. Clearly it is not as waterproof as claimed. I am glad we were only using it while wading in the ocean and not actually snorkelling.The battery life is extremely poor requiring charging every two days when the camera is moderately used.We also found the image quality not that good. After returning from our vacation, we looked at old images from our previous camera (Optio W10) and they were much better even though it was only 6 megapixels. In fact the same picture taken with our iPhone 3Gs had a better image quality.Pros- Great rugged looking designCons- Poor image quality- Freezes- Not completely waterproof- Poorly manufacturedSummaryClearly Pentax designed a nice looking camera that gives the illusion of ruggedness; however, their production quality of this model is extremely poor. We've returned the camera and are looking for a different one (not from Pentax) to replace it with.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "JLmike7", "ReviewID": "R8KU2AEK0XGK8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The most fantasticly durrible camera I have ever seen.  I have litterally tossed this thing around just for the fun of it, and it withstands anything.Performs great underwater.  A few bubbles come out of the power button which scared me at first, but it's normal.The battery charges only through an external charger (so it can have less waterproof ports I suppose)I am using a 16gb SD card which works great in it.  Screen is comfortably large and bright.Digital microscope blew my mind with the clarity and detail that can be achieved.  Zoom is reasonable.Pictures have a dramatic feel to them with great contrast.Software is easy to use, and took me about an hour to know every feature.  Great photo editing software is BUILT INTO THE CAMERA to do whatever effects you need done.Self-portrait mode is a little bit flaky but very interesting none the less.  Who uses facial recognition anyway, really?  lol.The feel of the camera is phenomenal.  Rubber and very hard grippy plastic cover the whole camera, and gives a very rugged and tough feel, but it is such a tiny lightweight package.Manual zoom, focus, aperture, and ISO come in very handy.All in all a fantastic camera, worth every penny. :)", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome All Around Camera", "Author": "michael bradley", "ReviewID": "R1MF0SZ4LNCJPP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am currently deployed to Afghanistan and I am around some rough terrain all the time with different conditions. Hot, Dusty, Cold, Wet, Rocky and this camera hasnt stopped working yet. I have dropped it from about 8 feet high off of a vehicle and yeah it is scratched but still works perfect. I have had it get wet but havn't used it submerged in water for a period of time yet. But I will. So far everything is awesome. I especially like the Safety clip it comes with. I think that was a great idea but I would suggest possibly upgrading the clip if you are a big outdoorsmen.

I haven't tested it underwater or really given it any abuse yet, but it seems to be built very sturdy. Feels good in the hand too. Cool rugged looks as well. The only negatives I can see are that the caribiner that comes with the camera is cheap, cheap, cheap, and of course the picture quality is probably about what you would expect from a fair quailty regular point and shoot. Lots of not so sharp pictures, color is often not true as well. Ocassionally it will take a picture that is right on, but it is the exception. I wasn't expecting superb picture quality, but I hoped for a little more consistency. If you are not a \"photographer\" you should absolutely love this camera. If you have an eye for it, then just don't expect much out of the picture quality.Overall I would recommend this as a great camera for those times you don't want to bring an SLR or a high end point and shoot, like at a beach, pool, lake, desert, etc. This certainly shouldn't be your only camera though.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Two big problems: fluorescent lights and video", "Author": "M. Cordoba \"mxc\"", "ReviewID": "R2MRAB857NG8BU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Just a note about myself that is relevant to this review: I own a DSLR and have owned many point and shoot cameras, I am well versed in using a camera (iso, aperture, shutter speed, white balance, etc)Pros:- Very good pictures under sunny and outdoor conditions (it saturates greens/blues so the pictures have quite a punch, but honestly in a positive way) this is really the best part of the camera, you can take it to the beach without worrying too much, or to the jungle (I went to the Amazon River with this camera) and the pictures for the most part were great.- Smaller than it looks, easy to carry- It takes pictures faster than a lot of other point and shoots- rugged feel with glass sunken in, so you'll never accidentally hit the lens unless you stick a thin object in there.- waterproof (they note that you have to change the rubber seals every year to keep the waterproofing working)Neutral:- glass is always exposed, which seems rather strange and maybe damaging for the camera. Most cameras either come with a cap, or close/hide. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say it's so rugged that it doesn't matter.Cons:- Absolutely terrible, unusable pictures under fluorescent lights (automatic setting is terrible, I tried various manual settings and got it a little better, but still unusable pictures, I don't think I've seen a worse camera under this conditions - with flash it was a little better for close things, but in general this is the camera's biggest weakness.- Video is terrible too. But this time even under the best sunny conditions, it is grainy and shaky even with image stabilization on. It is so terrible that even watching it in a small screen (much less than HD) it looks grainy.A cellphone (I took side by side shots with my samsung epic 4g) takes much, much better pictures under fluorescent lights than this camera. This was basically the reason I returned the camera, it was meant to replace completely another point and shoot, not just for outdoor sunny adventures. And seeing a cellphone handle the white balance so much better than this camera's auto setting and even manually optimizing and playing extensively with the white balance to make it work in this lighting - was what ultimately convinced me to return it.The only way I would recommend this camera is if you plan on taking pictures on the beach or out in the sun, and have another DSLR or point and shoot for any indoor activities. And you don't care for video, since even under the best conditions it was terribly grainy and the image stabilization doesn't seem to do anything for videos.", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worked for 15 days", "Author": "LF", "ReviewID": "R2QD5JW1U6P3P6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My teenage daughter purchased this camera for use. She saved her money and we ordered it & paid extra for 2 day shipping so she would have it for summer vacation. It worked great and the pictures were clear and the color excellent, for the first 15 days. Then she used it underwater at a pool no more than a few feet. It had condensaion in the screen and the flash area the next morning. I called Pentax and they were very laid back and told me to ship it back (at my expense) and they would check it and repair or replace it in 5 weeks. This item was less than 30 days old. (The best estimated turn around time is 5 weeks.) Summer vaction will be over in 5 weeks and she spent almost $300.00 to have no camera.

I have owned several digital point and shoot cameras and 35 mm cameras over the years including the older digital Pentax Optio WP 30.  The Optio WP 30 was a MUCH BETTER camera as far as photo quality! I consider myself a very good amateur photographer. Although the Pentax WG-1 camera seems to be rugged and waterproof, I find the photo quality very poor on every setting I tried.  The camera came without a warranty card so I am wondering if this was a previous return.  The camera's daylight photos were not sharp at 14 mp and at 5 mp. Colors were faded, inconsistent or appeared to have a lot of \"noise\" on all settings. The nighttime outdoor/indoor as well as lowlight shots were even worse with or without a flash. It doesn't seem to focus well in both daylight and nighttime shots. Photos were NOT SHARP! I'm not sure if this particular camera is defective but I am sending it back to Amazon for a refund.Pros = Looks rugged & feels good in hand.

I bought it in part so she could use it for our vacation which is a month from now. The camera seemed to be working fine except that it goes through power very quickly compared to our other digitals. Then the first time my wife got it near water it failed, she took it to the beach and had a friend take photos of her while she was surfing. He was standing on the shoreline taking pics and the camera got splashed. Since then the image on the screen is totally messed up and the captured images are completely washed out and distorted. The images that were captured on the card before the splash are fine but not after.I contacted Pentax customer service to see what they could do and I was basically told that I must be lying. Based on my previous experience with Pentax' customer service I had expected better. I told this person that there were others with similar experience and she actually searched for the reviews online while I was on the phone then told me that \"yes but in general the reviews weren't that bad\".So this is what I have learned about this product and Pentax generally, a lot of marketing not much substance. When the products work they are pretty good when they don't they're terrible and customer service may or may not be helpful. To me this inconsistency points to serious issues with their Quality organization. It shouldn't be hit or miss. It's a shame.If you want to gamble as to whether the product you spent hundreds of dollars on will work or not then maybe Pentax is for you.

As summers can be brutal here, we spend a lot of time at the beach, lake or in the pool. It makes sense for me to have a waterproof camera so I don't subject my DSLR to those conditions. I want a single camera that I can take on vacation and shoot stills and video and have reasonably good results. I want it to be waterproof and pocket-sized so I don't have to lug the camera bag with me or worry about getting it stolen. I understand the images won't be quite as good as my Sony DSLR.I took the Pentax WG-1 for a field test while my daughter and I were walking the dog. It was a lovely spring day, not too sunny, not too overcast. Perfect light you would say. Using the autopic feature - half the shots were out of focus. Of those few that were in focus, the color varied widely from shot to shot. Overall the shots were sort of washed out and faded. I tried the manual program mode and had slightly better luck but still 1 of 3 pics were blurry or soft.Other Negatives (besides the out of focus shots):Video was very shaky even with stabilization on - unusable.Video quality was extremely poor. It looked pixelated like it was up-sampled VGA - unusable.Video format is AVI?! Who the heck wants a AVI file in 2011? MPG at least or MP4 preferably.The microscope mode also has focus problems. When you half press to set the pic, it looks great. But when you actually take the pic, it comes out very blurry. Even with the 4 lights on.It uses a battery charger that looks like it should plug straight into the wall - but instead you get a long, heavy cable that plugs into the charger & then the wall. This makes it very inconvenient for travel. Many cameras today come with a single wall charger - this one has a 2 piece charger. That makes a difference when traveling.Positives:It looks neat & has a cool rubberized grippy feel. People will go \"ooohhh\" when they see it.Simple, logical button and interface layout. Will help for using the camera underwater or in adverse conditions.Final Assessment: the cool stylish look of the camera doesn't make up for the focus problems, the unacceptable low quality video and often unusable still pictures.-----------May 6th 2011 Update: I am returning this camera to Amazon.

Panasonic ts1/2/3 are actually better in terms of performance, but i had two of them leak in 6 to 10 feet of water on the first or second day of use, and third one gave out in about 6 month of regular use, no water. i find that unacceptable - after all, this type of cameras are bought for the adventure-minded people - and durability and reliability must be an absolute requirement before even getting into performance ratings.i wanted to see how deep this camera will work - took it on two dives, even though 33foot depth rating limits it to some advanced snorkeling, but it actually worked surprisingly well - did not leak at all, even though i took it down to 45-50 feet for half an hour twice. the only problem i had at that depth was the power button got \"pressed in\" by the water pressure, and camera would not turn on anymore until i took up closer to the surface. i would give this camera 6 stars for durability if i could.but the annoying part of it is shutter lag - it is very noticeable - good luck trying to take a pic of some fish swimming by... very frustrating. i was limited pretty much to taking pics of corals and such. i really hope pentax will fix this problem in the next version of the camera.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Terrible video quality, otherwise a good camera", "Author": "lookaught", "ReviewID": "R2FV0T660H0E29", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for the durability.

I love the underwater feature, it worked great and there were no signs of leakage even after multiple uses in the water. I also enjoy using all the different features on this camera such as the panoramic, 1cm macro, and on camera photo editing. It also took decent videos outside except for when there was a sunny glare off the water, it caused the video to look like it was shot using a super 8 camera (old time and grainy). It's an awesome everyday point and shoot camera that can be taken anywhere. Obviously the pictures taken with this camera dont compare to using my Nikon D5000, but that's only expected. If i know I want to take a high quality picture, I will switch cameras. Otherwise I enjoy using this one daily.Pros:-compact and durable-waterproof-on camera photo editing-cool featurescons:-low light situations-video while really sunny", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great pocket camera", "Author": "Adam Rooney", "ReviewID": "R29HO8JA3S76S0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was seeking durable camera I could use for day trips with my children, such as the beach or amusement parks. I grew tired of toting around a full size SLR (Canon) and separate digital video camera (FlipVideo). I love both of those cameras but they were just too inconvenient for regular use in busy environments, I needed something I could carry in my pocket and to snap what I what, whenever I need to. After 3 weeks of use, including a week long stay on the beach, some historical touring, back yard parties and a day at six flags, this camera is a true performer.My criteria was probably only a bit aggressive. I was looking for:1. pocket size2. good battery (I previously had a canon powershot pocket camera with awful battery life)3. High Resolution - 10MP+4. HD Video5. Water-Proof (we have a waterproof case for our Flip, and use it all the time!)6. Fast shooting speedThis Pentax camera answered all of the above and more. Here is what I got1. pocket size - obviously! And the caribiner is great too!2. good battery - awesome. Lasted 2 days at a time on vacation, roughly 300 shots per charge including shooting videos. At no time did I feel I needed to manage my power consumption conservatively.3. High Resolution - 14 MP, gives me plenty of real estate for cropping and unwanted elements while retaining high res of my subject.4. HD Video - It is not as good as the flip but it is good enough. There is slightly more digital blur on fast motion than you would get with a FlipVideo.5. Water-Proof - works great. I have shot both video and still photos so far and the quality has been amazing. In some photos you cannot even tell you are underwater.6. Fast shooting speed - This is obviously not and SLR camera, but overall the speed was good enough. The start-up time is very fast and the auto-focus is pretty quick.Other observations*The photo quality is very good for a pocket camera. Keeping in mind that the lens is pretty tiny, I was impressed with the the overall results.*With the camera set to auto, sometimes it chooses the wrong mode, such as failing to fire the flash in a low light scene. I found that re-shooting the shot again typically fixed this. I'm not sure if this is a firmware issue or just something that happens.*Smile detection works and is fun! It was a great was to let small children (age 2) take photos without having to learn how to use the buttons. You just have to point the camera at a person and the shutter will fire when the subject(s) smile!*Burst works OK. There are 2 burst modes. The high res mode takes full 14 megapixel photos at a rate a 1 per second, and the quality is still pretty good. With the caveat that while the burst is going on, the screen is only showing you the previous shot, not the current target, and there is no view finder aside from the screen. So trying to shoot a moving subject can be tricky. My solution was to zoom out a bit and do my best to follow the subject as best I could once the burst starts. This worked pretty well, because at 14 megapixel, I could still crop alot out of the zoomed out photo and end up with a great shot. There is also a high speed burst mode but that only take 5 MP images, and they were generally horrible. Of course neither burst mode allows for a flash so it can really only be used outside.Overall I am very pleased with this purchase. The price was super low and the results have been great. With a 16GB SD Card, I can't image any situation where I could fill up the whole thing, even considering how many photos I typically take. I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good compact camera", "Author": "Atari Fan", "ReviewID": "RL4P7R7R64E8D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Pentax WG-1 is a great small camera...but, like all other cameras, it is not perfect.First of all, I got this camera to replace my Optio S (the original).  I still love that old camera and it has gone everywhere with me.  The new WG-1 is a bit larger.  However, it makes up for the size with a fully interior lens mechanism.No worries about the telescoping lens getting damaged with this new model.  The \"all-internal\" works is very convenient.  The camera can turn on and take picture in less than 2 seconds!  Missing a shot is much less likely with the WG-1.  So far, battery life is respectable, considering its size.The digital microscope (supermacro) is as spectacular as ever.  The little LED lights help quite a bit for the closeups.  The (regular) macro is also fantastic.  The small macro stand is threaded so you can put 46 mm filters on this camera.  Try doing that with some other brand!In regular daylight, the camera takes great pictures.  The HD video is also good (don't expect any compact camera to take video like a dedicated video camera).  The new face and smile recognition functions are great.  Frown while setting up the picture, then smile...click...the camera shoots for you!  Cool!There are a few weaknesses with this camera.  The most glaring is the ability to take low light interior shots.  If you don't use the flash, don't expect miracles.  To give credit, I compared my WG-1 with my wife's higher-end Canon PowerShot.  Her PowerShot did NOT take pictures any better than the Pentax indoors with CFL lighting.  When zoomed in, the Canon had the same poor ability for indoor shots.  However, both cameras were comparable if the flash was used.  Flash made both cameras much better.  Also, the automatic mode for interior shots are guaranteed horrible with all compacts, so learn to use the custom settings on every camera indoors.Two other things could be improved.  First of all, it would be nice if 14 megapixel pictures looked a bit better than the 5 megapixel pictures.  I cannot tell the difference most of the time.  (The same is true for Canon, too, though.)Lastly, when hooked up to an HDTV via USB, my Vizio TV cannot display the movies...an HDMI cord (not included) is required for that.

I wanted a W90 but could not find any and had to go with the WG1.  I have to admit I was not that fond of the style but after using it for a few months I can honestly say it is no big deal. It is a fine camera and is good at what it does (take snap shots). I primarily shoot film as I sold all my fancy digital cameras and went back to analog. With that being said this camera excels at what it does. Takes decent digital snap shots for the necessary times ;) Its not a super brillant fancy digital point and shoot. Its an affordable (cheap) well made rugged few frills camera that is water proof, dependable and gets the job done with satisfactory results.

Awesome functions, however.First let me preface this by saying I loved this camera (and the precursor models). There are so many cool functions, for example, the digital microscope is a brilliant idea. I am a marine biologist so I thought this was a perfect camera for field work.However, the same \"leakiness\" issues persist with this model.  In the first W-90's I owned (yes, I owned two of them), the camera would randomly take on water for no apparent reason. First condensation would appear in the lens and view screen and then enough water clearly got in to fry the camera. At the time I didn't quite realize the condensation was indicative of flooding and was too wrapped up in the cool coral I was snorkeling around (I received a camera replacement from Pentax, however). I lost a week of work because I didn't have an underwater camera that worked to collect my data. The second camera they sent me still has the condensation issue...hence leakiness issue.I still bought the WG-1 despite my previous issues; I hoped they had fixed the issue. *Nope*. After I took it in the water for an hour at 2-3 ft depth(I use this camera for underwater pics of marine organisms for work), I noticed the condensation. So I put it back on the boat. Then later the condensation was gone, so back in it went. No problem. However, I also noticed that the condensation appears when the camera is out of the water.  So this leaky issue makes using the camera in the water difficult. For me, having a camera that works flawlessly in the water is essential.Other issues: I am not sure why but the focus (especially when in macro mode) will focus on an object perfectly and then the second I take the pic unfocuses itself. I don't know why it does this but its quite frustrating.Major issue (that I hope Pentax will reply to from my email tech support form): the LED lights just started to turn on when the camera was off. It was a bit odd to have this camera suddenly turn on when its sitting on my desk. So the LEDs are on whenever the battery is in. The lights also remain on when using the camera (even in non-microscope mode, of course). Sometimes the lights flicker and sometimes only 1 light is on. And the camera was not recently in the water so that is not likely a cause of the issue.So I hope that Pentax will honor the one year warranty and replace my camera or refund me, but at the same, I'm wary about getting another of this model. In fact, I just can't recommend it. As great as this camera is when it works, the threat of losing your camera and pics on a once in a lifetime vacation (or for me, precious data!!) doesn't make it worth the risk.Pentax if you are reading this review--- you have an excellent camera IF you can get this waterproofing issue (& other issues) worked out.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beyond Expectations", "Author": "AspenWillow \"AspenWillow\"", "ReviewID": "R2EF5KWQT0W7AB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for a Grand Canyon raft trip.

There are definite improvements to the \"Waterproofing\" of the camera parts.  It worked well so far but I've learned not to risk losing everything and downloaded the photos immediately!  I am happy with the new purchase!***********************************************************Okay - I've purchased this camera twice.  I originally bought this same camera in July of 2011.  It was stolen out of my car (which had over 100 pictures I had not downloaded yet) and decided to purchase the same camera/same color because it was such a great underwater camera.  I'll get to the new camera review in a minute ...The first camera - it is an awesomely small and easily handle-able  camera - even for my 9 year old.  It is light weight and although a little slow on the shutter speed took great pictures.  Blues and greens had awesome picture quality which is usual for Fuji pics but not many others.  So, although it was slow, this was outweighed by how easy it was to use.  I have to agree that the on/off switch is in a bad place next to the shutter button and sometimes gets turned off instead of taking pictures.  The only other con was the startup time.  It has this little audio chirp and screen shot before it's ready to take pictures.  Again, for an extremely rugged camera that took pictures snow skiing (extremely cold) as well as underwater at amusement parks - its a good camera.The second replacement camera (different vendor from the first purchase) came in the mail and our first excursion this past weekend was to our waterpark.  The camera took great pics but the first immersion into the wave pool fried the camera completely.  If I hadn't had the camera previously - I would have said I did something wrong in inexperience - but this was such a horrible experience having lost some great pictures twice now (granted the first was to a theft). I looked to see if I mistakenly purchased a refurbished camera the second time and found that I did not so I am left to wonder how two of the same cameras could leave such varying experiences. The camera froze and then eventually turned off leaving a fogged screen and loss of pictures.  Having just purchased the camera, I immediately returned this camera and am waiting on the refund so that I can find something else.I've looked all day at other underwater cameras to buy - I need one for my son's birthday party at the same waterpark in a couple weeks.  Nothing else out there is like it - they are bigger, bulkier, and terrible reviews.

Picture quality was also very good and even though I am not an expert in taking pictures, I was very happy with the Option W90.Sadly, I lost the darn thing and needed a replacement.The next generation was the WG-1 and I thought it would everything I needed. Waterproof (even deeper than the W90!), more rugged and a greater pixel capability.Pictures come out fine for me, once you get used to the delay and how to coax the camera into focusing on far away shots, they look great.Video on the other hand is a complete disappointment. After buying the camera I finally found tons of posts concerning the camera's inability to take even fair videos in sunlight. Every video I takes looks like a bad Super 8 film from the 60's. Colors are washed out, there are lines throughout the videos.This camera was a waste of over $200 and I will be forced to find a suitable replacement for me needs! I just don't understand how a next generation camera would be worse than an older version.I hate to be so negative. I bought on Ebay and I'm stuck with it, not the seller's fault.

We found this pentax at target.  The look of the camera is aggressive and fits well in your hand.  The price was right, so we went with it.Took it to schlitterbahn the next day and took a few photos with it while waiting for the first water ride.  Worked fine with the exception of the lens would get droplets on it, and the oils of your fingers made it almost impossible to clean it. (and wet swimming shorts only brought more water droplets)  We decided to hit up the lazy river and that's when I found out said \"waterproof camera\" was in fact \"not so waterproof\".Tried to take a underwater photo and instantly saw it had water on the inside.  The lens and the rear screen had condensation in it.  By the time we left the water, it was almost too hot to touch and blinking through various screens.  My biggest fear was that I lost all my photos of the family from the evening before.Good news is we have the photos.  Bad news is the camera is miserable.

I went climbing with it ONCE and I got a scratch on it.  The second complaint was the day after I went deep-water-soloing with it, the lens was fogged up.

Open up the battery compartment and it seems to air out after 20 min or so.All and all, it seems a rather sturdy outdoor sports camera", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Too bad \"life-proof\" doesn't include shooting one-handed", "Author": "Synergyrl", "ReviewID": "R3NVS86DLRMC7C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Image quality, controls and features are excellent.  Shutter lag is minimal.  The zoom range is perfect - a 5x medium-wide to medium-telephoto range is much more useful in fast action situations than a 10x normal to long tele.  The camera easily slides in and out of a shirt pocket, and it's rugged.  Most of the moving parts are internal, and that's a big plus: no motorized lens wimpily zooming in and out and getting stuck when it meets its first grain of sand.  I love the idea of a \"lifeproof\" camera to take along when you're doing something exciting and memorable - in other words, something worth photographing!  My issue is that they don't take the concept far enough.Consider the circumstances when you're kayaking, mountain biking, rock climbing or snowboarding.  Chances are you only have one hand free for photography because the other one is busy fending off disaster (and if you're mountain biking, the free hand should be the left one).  You're probably wearing sunglasses, maybe gloves too, and if you have to set the camera down there may be nothing around but rocks or dirt to set it on.Now look at the WG-1 or its successor, the WG-2.  All the controls are crammed against the right edge of the top and back, so if you're holding the camera in your right hand, it's pretty hard to reach anything with your right thumb except the zoom control.  Many of the controls are too close together to easily work with gloves on, although the critical power, shutter release and zoom controls are a little more spread out.  There's no viewfinder, so you have to either \"shotgun\" your composition or take off the sunglasses and use the unavailable left hand to shade the LCD screen from harsh sun glare.  (To be fair, it's a pretty bright screen.)  If you set the camera down and it can't balance on its narrow bottom edge you'll scratch either the lens or the LCD screen.So what can you do?  I made a wrist strap the exact length necessary to keep the camera in my palm while my fingers push against it, giving the thumb and forefinger as much room as possible to grope around, but it's not a very stable grip.  I can hold the camera upside down in my left hand and push the shutter release with my thumb, leaving the right hand free to work the rear brake of the mountain bike.  I keep the macro ring always attached, giving the lens a little separation from the dirt if the camera falls over on its face.What could Pentax do differently with the next lifeproof camera?  Most of the drawbacks have to do with that nice big LCD screen, and that's too bad because big screens seem to be as much a selling point as megapixels used to be.  Here's a bold idea: make a smaller screen dedicated to data and image review only, add a nice optical viewfinder, use the extra room on the back to make the controls bigger and located for convenient one handed use (I guess it will have to be the right hand).  Add a little ergonomic bulge on the right edge so it's easier to grip the camera.  Recess the lens and the LCD screen behind a protective rim.  (There are four tiny raised dots that keep the LCD screen from getting scratched if you lay it on a glass table top, but they don't help with a rougher surface.)  If these ideas are too radical, how about a pop-up folding cover plate for the LCD screen that protects it when closed and shades it from the sun when open?  Maybe even a lens cap?  But I really want that viewfinder.The WG-1 is still a great camera overall.  I just think the \"lifeproof\" label really means childproof or idiot-proof, and it's not really designed for the circumstances implied by the fake-carabiner accessory strap that comes with the camera.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "One tough camera", "Author": "Dar", "ReviewID": "R2O27ABVO0XRJ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my son who likes to snorkel.

The video was so-so, same with picture quality. But I didn't buy this to do pro quality shoots.  I got it because I spend a lot of time outdoors in conditions not suited for an SLR.To that end I have this to say:  The carabiner clip is quite handy for the uber-active types who don't want to wear a fanny pack and when reaching into a pocket is difficult/impossible (ie rock climbing, bicycling, kayaking); just clip it to a belt loop, life vest, backpack shoulder strap, etc.  Also, I've taken it into and underwater numerous times, dropped it, put it in a bag with pounds of equipment sitting on it, taken it into below freezing temperatures.  Basically, I've tested all major features that set a \"life-proof\" camera apart from a normal point and shoot.  I jokingly called it my Kevin-Proof camera.Kevin-Proof it is not, however.  The thing that ultimately ruined the camera was no where near the advertised limits of its crush-proofness.  I had it in a pocket of my shorts that was near my knee and after having sat cross-legged, or Indian style, for a mere 15 minutes I took it out to discover the screen was smashed.  The advertised weight limit is 100 kg, which is right around my body weight, but sitting the way I was would have only put a small fraction of that onto the camera.  Small enough that I didn't notice I was resting my leg on it.  It is now just short of completely unusable.  I can't change functions (other than back and forth from picture to video because I fortunately made that my option for the programmable green button), but even then I have to put the camera to my ear and listen to weather it \"clicks\" like the shutter opened and closed or if it beeps like a video is being taken.  Al so underwater shooting is out of the question, as is the macro function, which were my 2 favorite aspects of the camera.I'm out of the country on an extended trip (including hours of scuba and snorkeling) so trying to deal with the warranty is out of the question and buying a new camera is not in the budget. I will however be in Pentaxland (read: Vietnam) in a couple of weeks, so maybe I can pick up cheap parts someone smuggled out of the factory.  ;-)  But probably not.

Everday photo quality mediocre.", "Author": "Adam D. \"Aragon\"", "ReviewID": "R158TB29Z9F4P6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for all of the features it had, from being waterproof to having macro capability, to being shockproof.  I'm an outdoor enthusiast, and find that some of the best photos I can get are during the worst weather conditions.  Animals often can't hear or smell you when it's raining for example. Well, to make a long story short: what this camera does well, it does great, but it has shortcomings.  I live in the Northeast and have used it in every weather condition.  On a rainy day you can haul out this camera and get right to work with no worries.  But on a sunny day, this is not the camera to use.Pros:-Waterproof, shockproof, freezeproof.-Clips onto garments/packs.  Have been able to keep this clipped to pack strap/clothing/gear and don't worry about banging it on stuff.-MACRO: this feature, if you figure out how to use it, is Amazing.  Almost worth the money just for this.  (Can be used in move mode too.)-L.E.D.'s on Front.  These work great with the macro feature, but they also count down when using the self timer so you know when the camera is going to fire.Cons:Image quality.  In normal conditions, the photos are somewhat dull and colorless.  It must be because the lens is buried behind the waterproof shell.-Somewhat slow.  It takes a while to write images to disk.To put this poor image quality into perspective, however, let me add that if you need a camera for your pack or boat, or whatever other nook or cranny that is located within a maelstrom of varying weather conditions, when you haul your Optio out on a rainy day, the colors are going to be muted anyway, and there is also going to be a bit of a grainy look about everything anyway.  For example, I had this camera on me when I was hiking in the rain one day and came across a beaver that was chewing on trees.  I was able to get some great video of the beaver in a downpour and it looked very good.  On the other hand, when I try to use it in dry bright conditions, I can't say it's focusing all that well.  The colors are dull.So you are buying a waterproof camera.  Just something to keep in mind.  This may not replace an average point and shoot for the day to day, but it could be indispensable to a hiker, biker, kayaker or boater's equipment.  After 8 months of frustration however, I chose to borrow a Canon SD 1400 and have been using that and have been leaving the Pentax at home; but I'm about to receive a Canon T3i in the mail, and will now have both the Pentax and the Canon DSLR on me from now on.  So in that sense, I love my Pentax because it can take photos that another camera can't.  I can run, hike, and explore with the Pentax while leaving the DSLR in a safe place when necessary.  I also think the MACRO setting will outdo the Canon's abilities until I can afford a lens that will probably cost as much as the entire Optio Camera.  I started writing this review by giving the Optio WG-1 3 stars, but after working on this meandering disaster, I'm bumping it up to 4.I hope this helps.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for water activities & macros", "Author": "SMULawyer", "ReviewID": "R15C8O7C2OXQFO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm updating my review 6 months later (July 2012).  I just got back from Costa Rica, and I have to say that BUT FOR this camera, we'd have NO pictures of 90% of the stuff we did in Costa Rica!  From rappelling through waterfalls to white water rafting to surfing to ATVing in the pouring rain through mud and waterfalls.  None of us could risk our very expensive DSLRs for any of these activities, so I was the ONLY one who was able to capture all of this fun stuff!  And this camera takes video, too, so I have great video and pics (not SO great of quality pics, as per my below Dec 2011 review) of everything we did when no one else does!  And I tried out the actually \"underwater\" pics, and they are awesome--oddly, actually so much brighter/better than many of the other non-underwater pics! Very durable camera and I love the sturdy carabiner (clasp thing), which allowed it to be hooked onto my harnesses, life vests, bathing suits, etc., so it held up and continued taking pics/videos despite being clacked and clanged and banged and smooshed, etc.  Great buy!(Dec 2011) So I'm a camera freak with unreachably high expectations for the quality of my photos. But I was going to Iguazu Falls in Argentina and needed a waterproof camera for the under-the-falls portion of my trip. I researched a lot, and the reviews said this Pentax was durable, took decent pics and took great (very sharp) macros.  All true for the most part.  I'm back from my trip to the Falls, and my pictures are hilarious.  Of course, I'd have MORE hilarious pictures IF I would have switched the camera mode to \"underwater.\"  My understanding of \"underwater\" was being submerged...not so. If you're taking ANY pictures where water is SPLASHED up at the camera, please change the mode to \"underwater,\" or you will be disappointed like I was.  Once I saw that my pics had huge blurred spots from water drops, I quickly changed the mode to \"underwater,\" and the remainder of my pics are great!  As for non-water activity pics--this camera is decent (not great) enough for outside pics (natural sunlight) but not good enough for my unreasonably high expectations.  Overall good purchase for my purposes, which was to have fun pics of our trip under and through some of the most magnificent waterfalls in the world!

I just got back from a bicycle tour of the Tuscany region of Italy where I used a 16 GB SD card with it.  I needed a fairly rugged camera that I could carry in the back pocked of my cycling jersey, but didn't want salty sweat to mess up the camera.  It is small and thin so it fit perfectly.  I removed the outer macro focusing ring since I needed the camera a thin as practical.  I shot over 800 pictures and videos with the camera set at the highest resolution and it still said I had about 800 to go on the 16 GB card...amazing. (It actually said I had around 3,800 shots available, if I remember correctly, but the video takes up a good bit of that capacity.  When I got home and downloaded the pictures and videos, there were around 800 that I had shot, not 3,000--thank goodness!)I shot some pictures underwater in a pool and in the Mediterranean at Talamone. I never got deeper than 5 feet, but the shots were excellent. The movies in good light were great, but in low light, they were pretty grainy.  The audio pick-up was great.

Its seems silly to make a small portable camera and then have a tiny battery that takes maybe 200 pix (less using the flash) before its drained. The large bulking charging unit is what kills it for this camera. Why not make the charger smaller minus the bulk cord, have the micro USB cord charge the camera from your computer which it does not , plus the USB cord is a MICRO USB cord , not a issue but just another cord to carry around.This camera has no lens protection and is marketed as a rugged unbreakable camera, yes it is that , however drop it on its face or damage the glass lens cover and the camera is useless with a crack or scratch on the lens.

I guess a case might fix this, but a slide cover would as well.  Having this on a lanyard implies that you want this readily available, nto in a case.

We ended up renting a camera with an underwater case and the pictures and movies were great. These consumer waterproof cameras for under $300 are not made to last. We met a couple that was on their third Olympus. These cameras do not take the greatest pictures either. If you must own one I recommend not taking taking it more than 4 feet underwater. Limit submersion time. However renting a 800 dollar camera for 50 dollars a week is an option you might consider.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "jpeg incompatability, mediocre image quality, other stuff", "Author": "Austin J.

The manual, and Pentax \"customer support\" assure me that the camera produces jpegs, and only jpegs.  But my Windowx XP home machine, a Mac, and both of my Linux boxes refuse to load the files, telling me that they aren't jpegs, or they don't start with the right hex character, or the files are corrupt.  They load fine on facebook, and on my Windows 7 work machine.  I've made sure to download the most recent versions of digikam, fstop, and gimp on my linux boxes, and picassa and a couple of other programs on my XP box.  And the included photo software won't load on my XP, telling me that it doesn't like my graphics card, and won't run under WinE on my Linux boxes.  Pentax tells me that I must  have software problems on all my machines <g>. Pentax support, btw, is only available from 0930 to 1830 eastern.  If I can't edit, or even look at, my photos on my home computers the camera is going back.Other issues have been noted by other reviewers.  Picture quality is decent but not spectacular in decent light.  But in bright light, or at dusk, image quality on the automatic setting is pretty crappy.  Underwater images are mediocre.  Mediocre battery life and need an external charger.  Can't cover the lens, which is awfully nerve wracking when carrying it around a lava strewn island.  And the memory/battery cover opens if you bump it the wrong way, which is really nerve wracking when using the camera underwater.
