I got this and the dock for the same price as the Kodak Easyshare C743.  It takes very good pictures and it is easy to operate.  I  have had a little trouble with the software as far as transfering pictures to the computer, especially with the select and transfer function.  It won't let me select any pictures to transfer so I have to choose the \"Transfer All\" function.  It works the same way and doesn't transfer anything that has already been transfered from the camera previously.  Another thing I'm not real crazy about is that the videos are in mpeg-4/Quicktime format which makes it more difficult for me to compress the videos to a smaller size so I can send them to family/friends.  Overall though I feel this is a good camera for the amateur photographer with the software problem and video being my only complaints.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera with features you can't easily find", "Author": "GSinNC", "ReviewID": "RITSQSZ3WHW1M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the 2nd C703 I have owned and purchased this one for my wife.  It is compact, takes very good pictures and not only has a real optical view finder but uses good old AA batteries!  I use the HD card to store photos and to transfer to my computer.  It may not be the latest model camera and while small is not tiny.  But it does a lot well!", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Eats Batteries Like Crazy", "Author": "sandpiper", "ReviewID": "R1NNNJZP0HM28O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a few months before it started acting *funny\". It won't turn on unless I use fresh Duracell batteries. I've tried all battery brands but this camera only likes fresh from the pack Duracells. It won't even turn on when I put in rechargeable Duracells. I only get to snap 1 pic too before it completely drains the fresh batteries I just put in.", "Date": "November 26, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000M3VWYS"}}
