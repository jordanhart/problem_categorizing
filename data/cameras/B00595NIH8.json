With the camera based image stabilization, you can use any micro four thirds lens, including the Panasonic lenses as well as Olympus E Series lenses with the appropriate adapter. I used this camera with a Panasonic 100-300 lens at a Redskins game and found the auto focus and image stabilization good enough to capture action in the opposite end zone late in the afternoon when the light was fading. I would not consider getting this camera without the optional electronic viewfinder. The viewfinder is an extra expense and potentially easy to lose. I think it would be great if there were a way to lock it onto  the flash shoe, so it does not fall off. The technical support at Olympus was excellent when I called. The choice at this price point and format is the Panasonic GH2 and the Olympus E-P3. the advantage of the Olympus is the camera based image stabilization and build quality. The Panasonic has an LCD screen that can be moved that allows viewing from different angles and has the advantage of a built in viewfinder as well. I own both cameras but would give the edge to the Olympus because of the built in image stabilization and build quality.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "a beautifully designed camera that produces excellent results", "Author": "Patrick R.

When you are choosing a new camera you must weigh the benefits of a given design and system against the compromises that have been made. The Olympus E-P3 is a beautiful evolution in the Olympus micro-4/3rds line. I purchased this camera with the 17mm lens kit. The 17mm is a great lens for its size, and the on-board image stabilization works well with compact lenses like this and Panasonic's 20mm and 14mm pancakes. I wanted to get back that small size, large aperture feeling that I used to enjoy from the great 35mm compact rangefinders of the 1970's, and this camera fills the bill. The flash works well, when needed. ISO 1600  RAW images processed with Adobe Camera Raw yield pleasantly grainy results. Using slower speeds generates reliably clean output.I considered the Sony NEX series, but the weak performance of their 16mm pancake (and relative lack of other reasonably priced primes) pushed me toward micro-4/3rds.The in-body image stabilization was a deciding factor for this model over the offerings from Panasonic, particularly because I knew that I would mostly use this camera with the compact prime lenses that lack stabilization.An articulating screen would be nice, but I guess I'll have to wait for the perfect camera ;-)", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent value for a lightweight DSLR system", "Author": "Dead Cow", "ReviewID": "RQI36MC74KPDX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i happily owned a canon xti body with 70-200 f2.8L is & 17-55 f2.8 lenses for 6 years.  the size and weight finally got to my back.  i'm not a pro photog, just a dad who loves taking pix of his kids playing sports.  i've since sold the lenses to purchase a \u00b543 system.  i also borrowed a panasonic gh1 with the 20mm f1.8 pancake lens before purchasing the oly e-p3.my purchase decision came down to the panasonic gx1 vs. the olympus e-p3 ($799 with the 17mm f2.0), and went olympus because of in body stabilization.PROS* lightweight.  your back will thank you.* compact.  i easily fit the oly e-p3, 45mm f1.7, 17mm 2.8, and panny 14-140mm, 100-300mm in a lowepro 100 sling.* hd video in avchd or motion jpeg* high iso, i shot my daughter's night soccer playoff game at 4000 iso with acceptable graininess (max 128,000).* in body stabilization, great for prime lenses without is.* acceptable built in flash, mainly for fill* compatibility with canon external flash (with loss of some auto settings)* acceptable battery life (but do always have 'at least 1 extra charged battery on hand)* full aperture, shutter, and manual controls* special settings (fireworks, portrait, night, etc.)CONS* focusing in low light takes some time* if set to continuous autofocus, shutter lag is unacceptable* menu system is disorganized / confusing, not as intuitive as the panasonic and canon systems* occasionally exposure is off (sometimes way over exposed or under exposed)* i'd rather have the panasonic 20mm f1.8 instead of the oly 17mm f2.8.  oh well.* when videoing, the crop factor jumps up, so you can't rely on what you see to compose.  try pre-videoing to get an idea of the crop before actually videoing.* no articulating screeni used to lose lens caps all the time.  try these lens cap leashes (hmm, used to be $3.00 for five, it's currently $7.50).  cut off the adhesive \"plate\", it's useless and falls off easily.  instead, drill a tiny hole into the lens, thread the string in, and tie a few knots to secure the string.  5 LENS CAP LEASH!

This camera is awesome! For the semi-pro and amateurs looking for a smaller, lightweight alternative, look no further. I use a Canon 7D, and honestly, I find myself leaving the camera at home because it is just so bulky! I am able to pack this camera into a small purse and I still produce the same quality images. Not to mention the oohs and aahs and intsant Q&A; session I receive from people when I pull it out. I also have a lot of fun with the built in filters, a feature that I thought I would never use because I'd rather process my images in Photoshop. But lo and behold, the black + white and lomo-style filters get used quite often. Great low light photos as well.My only negative and it's a big negative, is that I tend to get a lot of blurry images when I use the Auto focus mode. All of the reviews I read praise this camera for its stabilization feature, and perhaps I'm doing something wrong, but 9 times out of 10, I'm getting slightly blurred photos if not outright blurry images.

I started my DSLR camera journey seven years ago, invested in entry level Canon.  With kit lens, results were ok but not great or not much better than the small point and shoot sony.  Then I switched to Nikon D90, it just felt better in my hand and for a while enjoyed great results with 18-200 lens.  Added a fast prime lens and flash and that was my set for two years.  When D7000 came, I was the first to order and was very happy with the results. But.  I realized I left the camera at home when we go out with kids, sports, parks or even when I visited Italy.  It was too bulky to carry around.  This is a personal choice but when you have two kids, and multi tasking, it is not very convenient to carry a bulky DSLR.  In June, I ordered Olympus OMD EM5.  Never had an experience with Olympus, neither know much about the brand.  But OMD is the right camera, at the right time of my life.  it is compact but produces excellent results. It is close to D7000, but much much compact.  It comes to anywhere with me.  I enjoyed using that beast.  After a month use of my OMD, my wife wanted a camera that she can shoot kids as iphone camera was a sloppy one.  I gave a shot to EP3.  I am glad i did.  With the Olympus 45mm prime lens, it produces excellent results.  I had no jelly effect during video like other reviewer mentioned.  The photos are sharp, right color, and simply top DSLR quality.  besides, it is great compact size. she loves it and enjoys the photos she takes.  EP3 stays in our car all the time.  it is ready, fast, sharp and produces excellent results.  with half the size of DSLRs with mirror...

I was expecting to have to shoot RAW files, but the out of camera JPEGS are amazing. Plus is you want to fine tune the JPEG, the settings allow you to tweak them to suit your sensibility. IOS up to 1600 looks terrific and if you are in a jam, the higher ISOs are more than useable. The OLED screen is gorgeous. I wish my TV had as spectacular of a picture. And while I thought the touchscreen interface was a feature that I wouldn't use, it is thoughtfully configured and more importantly very responsive. Most reviews rave about the lightening fast focus...and I agree. There's a little hunting and pecking at incredibly low light elves but manual focusing is and and I loge the manual focus asset feature. If you can't tell, O am crazy happy with my PEN E-P3.

stabilization causes in hand-held videos.  Read this review for more details.I wanted to love this camera, and as a still photography camera, I do hold it in high esteem. But any camera you buy these days should be expected to take acceptable video, and here the E-P3 disappoints.The video quality has the potential to be awesome, with great detail and vivid colors, but with the camera's built-in image stabilization turned on, the captured video dances around and shimmies like Jello when you move the camera. This is especially true during pans or when zooming, but is also the case every time the image stabilization is called upon. So, jiggle the camera slightly, and your subjects jiggle in the most awful way. This, combined with the significant \"rolling shutter\" effect (which makes vertical lines appear to be \"leaning\" one way or another when panning), renders the video mode virtually useless.  The video is actually more acceptable with the built-in image stabilization turned OFF (although rolling shutter effect is still present). But of course, that requires you to be using a tripod or have a super-human ability to not jiggle the camera during videos. Having owned and used a number of other cameras - including some inexpensive compact cameras - that take acceptable video, I could not believe that this rather expensive camera from Olympus could not take video that was at least on par with cameras costing a fraction as much.  Believe it. If video is important to you, this camera is probably worthless to you. And this is the primary reason that I returned the camera after only a few days.In fairness, I can foresee a couple of scenarios where the video might be acceptable: Scenario one is if you turn in-body image stabilization off and use a tripod, and don't do a lot of panning. Scenario two, which I didn't get to test in the short time I had this camera, is that certain Panasonic M43 lenses have an On/Off switch on the lens for Optical Image Stabilizaton (OIS). In this case you can turn the E-P3's in-body image stabilization off and turn the Panasonic lens's OIS on. (If the Panasonic lens doesn't have an On/Off switch, the OIS is off by default when used on an Olympus M43 camera. There are only a couple of Panasonic M43 lenses with the On/Off switch.) But using one of these Panasonic lenses - with OIS turned on and in-body IS turned off - MIGHT result in acceptable video. Who knows? It seems plausible.Regarding this camera's ability as a still photography camera, it is really good. I love how customizable it is, and how much control you can exercise over every aspect of this camera's performance and handling. On one hand it is a camera with which a beginner can take stunning photos without diving very deep into the controls, and on the other hand there is virtually nothing you could wish for that you can't do. It is an extremely full-featured camera.My favorite feature is the touch focus with shutter actuation enabled. You frame your photo on the screen, and then touch the area of the screen that you want the camera to focus on, and almost before your finger leaves the screen, the camera has focused and snapped the shot. (Using the latest Olympus and Panasonic M43 lenses, focus is VERY fast!) This camera has 35 focus areas, so you can be very specific about what you focus on. And the \"feel\" of the touch screen is good, as well - not quite as responsive as a new iPhone, but if you're an iPhone user you'll feel at home with the way this screen responds. By comparison, the Panasonic GX1 that I tried had a sluggish, unresponsive feel to its touch screen (reminding me very much of my frustrating older TomTom GPS). With the E-P3 you can tap the screen to focus and/or trip the shutter (you can set it for touch focus only or touch focus & shutter). But with the GX1, you have to \"press\" your finger on the screen and hold it there a moment to focus or trip the shutter. On the subject, I like that the E-P3 remembers your touch settings - either touch focus only or touch focus & shutter - when you power off and on. The Panasonic always defaults to touch focus only, and you have to go to a menu to change it back to touch focus & shutter, every time you power back on. I soon found myself annoyed at the Panasonic because of that, because I find touch focus & shutter to be one of the most useful features I've ever tried on any camera. It really helps you quickly get exactly the shot you envision, regardless of your frame composition.Regarding image quality, I am very happy with the E-P3, although I wish it had the higher ISO capabilities and higher 16mp resolution of the GX1. I am VERY happy with the JPEG images of the E-P3. (I do not shoot much in RAW format.)The E-P3 is a complex, highly customizable camera, and you would do well to read a number of reviews before deciding whether this camera is for you, as each reviewer will bring their own perspective. If you shoot primarily or exclusively still photos, the E-P3 needs to be high on your consideration list. But if video is important to you, look elsewhere.Update - 5/18/2012:  I was able to try a Panasonic 45-200 lens with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), which has an external on/off switch for its OIS, on an Olympus E-PM1.  The E-PM1 is identical in function to the E-P3, with fewer external controls in a smaller form factor, and has the same problems with video as the E-P3.  Turning the built-in IS off, and turning the lens's OIS on, I was able to take excellent video with none of the problems that the camera's built-in IS causes. (Rolling shutter effect will still be present under certain circumstances.) Unfortunately, there are very few Panasonic OIS lenses with an external on/off switch, and those without the external switch default to \"OIS off\" mode when used on an Olympus camera.  But if you have one of these Panasonic lenses with the external on/off switch, you will be able to take good hand-held video using that lens with the E-P3 or E-PM1.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "beautiful pictures. terrible video", "Author": "fuglis", "ReviewID": "R222BH5TW1DZ3O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "beautiful pictures. terrible video - says it all really. the video keeps on autofocusing which is both noisy and jarring when viewing.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect second camera to pro DSLR", "Author": "J.

Don't get me wrong, I love my Nikon, but I have broken more than a few purses that couldn't handle the load.  I wanted point and shoot size with DSLR features and quality.  I wanted a great lens, nice bokeh, and a decent price.  I didn't want a second photography habit to buy for, so I made the decision to go with the Olympus Ep3.  I knew I wasn't a kit lens fan, and it was honestly a larger lens than I wanted to deal with.  I wanted a take along \"downsize\" and that didn't include being careful about the lens of the camera.  I settled on the 17mm lens + camera kit.  I did my research and reviewed everything I could to be sure this camera would be a suitable stand-in for the D700, and I must say, I am over the top pleased about it!It's everything I could want in a small camera.  My neck, shoulders and purses are MUCH happier with this - and it fills the need I have wanted for a long time, to have a camera with me at all times, that was better than the iphone, and smaller than my DSLR with exceptional quality.  The manual modes on the camera are great, the 17mm performs stunningly in low light, and the camera in general is just wonderful.  This is the perfect second camera for anyone who needs to leave the big boy at home and still expects photos at a certain quality (and shutters of a certain speed!).", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this retro looking Olympus.", "Author": "Howard P \"Writer of Songs, Musician, Photogra...", "ReviewID": "R1UPWZQKWBURTO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My new favorite camera. As an advanced amateur I wanted a small camera with the ability to manually control and interchange lenses. The EP-3 was the flagship of the Pen line.

It is a great product, well-made, metal body etc. If you are looking for a camera that is way beyond a simple point & shoot, the EP-3 fits the bill - especially paired with VF-2 viewfinder.

The specialist answered all my questions and I was very happy with how I was treated and my questions answered.  As a result, I purchased the camera along with an Olympus FLR 50 flash, Olympus flash bracket, Olympus 14 - 150mm zoom lens, lens hood, and some other small items.  I have had the camera for less than a year.  I used the EP3 occasionally, as I also use my Olympus XZ-1, and Olympus OMG, OM2N's, OM2S, OM4's, and OM4T's.  I've had those cameras for decades and they still work flawlessly with all their flashes, drives, bounce grips,and other accessories.Although the EP3 was barely used, and handled carefully, never bumped, dropped, or anything close to that, the mode selector dial on the top of the camera came off while I was changing the mode.  I looked at the underside, and it appears to have been attached with just a drop of glue.  I decided before gluing it back on, I would call the toll free Olympus line and speak to the EP specialist again.  \"Send it in.\"  That is all I heard as I was bounced from one person to the next.  Finally, I got a supervisor and was told what I was asking is \"proprietary information\" and they can not tell me if it is just mounted with a dab of glue, I would have to send the camera in to have it reattached. I find this absurd.  Apparently, once Olympus has your money, they're done with you.  When I place the cap back on where it was I can change the mode, it appears that nothing is missing, and I can see glue traces on the bottom of the cap but I can't get an answer from Olympus.  The Olympus supervisor actually accused me of droppiing the camera.  This is a $900.00 brand new camera and a plastic mode dial is apparently glued on and falls off after a few months of gentle use.Zero stars for Olympus customer service.Zero stars for this camera as well for the above reason and many others.This camera is worthless in low light.  Even with the Olympus FL-50R, flash pictures are poor, when and if the camera can focus in low light.  It is NOT a low light, in door camera.Outside in daylight the focus is fast, but if it is too bright out, it's guess and shoot as the screen gets washed out by the sun.Also, I have seen Olympus advertise this camera as a metal bodied camera.  It is not.  This is a plastic bodied camera, covered by a thin sliver of metal.  I looked at online reviews where they took the camera apart and it is plastic bodied, not metal, with a thin metal covering.  This is like calling a 14K gold plated ring a gold ring.  It is not, it's plated.  This is a metal covered, (plated), camera that is cheaply made but sells for $900.00.  I was planning on buying more lenses for this camera, but now I am done with Olympus.  It is a good thing this happened before I spent more money on this cheap, plastic, piece of garbage with non-existant \"customer service\".Note to Olympus, at least upgrade to a better quality of glue.", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$899.99", "Features": "NEW 12.3MP LIVE MOS SENSORThe sensor is optimized to maximize the performance of all mZuiko digital lenses in any shooting condition.\nThe E-P3's three-mode In-body Image Stabilization system compensates for up to three shutter speed steps in the still shooting modes with any of its interchangeable lenses.\nShoot up to 29 minutes of 1080i HD video and stereo sound in either AVCHD or AVI formats.
