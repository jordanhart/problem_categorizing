The reviews from Steve and other experts are not too bad. The sample pictures online are really nice to me.So I bought it. I like it very much before I found this problem.THE SOUND VOLUME of the VIDEO is VERY VERY LOW! you can barely hear it if you shoot someone a couple of feet away. How disappointing!I called Samsung to make sure whethter it is a design issue or just this one I got is malfunctioning. The RP was so rude. She told me, \"this is a still camera, no a video camera\", \"it is not a design issue\".I used Sony P-92 before. The volume level of that camera is very good. But this Samsung V700, what a flaw. Otherwise I will like it and keep using it.I ended up sold it on ebay. Please avoid this one if you are inrerested in its mpeg4 video. It is not worth it.", "Date": "October 10, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good value for money", "Author": "Ashwin Shetty", "ReviewID": "R2JJENK6FAZ7DV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Has all the necessary features.
