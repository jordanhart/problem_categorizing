It has a nice size preview screen that makes it easy to see your shot.  It has good color nice sizing and responds well to all kinds of light levels.  I really like the preview screen, it nice size.  I bought this camera to replace the old point and shoot camera and my wife loves it.  She likes the menu better and says it much easier to use.  She is not one to take a lot of picture because the old camera was not \"user friendly\" for her, but this one is very \"friendly\".", "Date": "March 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worth the Money", "Author": "DFOX \"DFOX\"", "ReviewID": "R39GM9HIWZ1W7V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a point and shoot camera. I have needed one for a while and picked one up at Staples for [...] after rebate! It is worth every bit of what I paid, easy interface, long lasting rechargeable battery, and USB cable and charger.

Reyes \"ekala\"", "ReviewID": "R2C157G7E1LS11", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well there's good and bad with this camera. One thing is if you set the picture quality on \"normal\" you will get somewhat fuzzy or blurry photos like some others have said, although your picture files won't be so large size in megabytes. With quality set on \"fine\" the pictures are decent, but file size is large, almost too large. Colors on some photos sometimes come out too reddish. Outdoor movies can come out horrible, very red, overall this is not a good movie camera, Samsungs tend to be very good for movies. Battery life is very good, drain it at least once and then fully charge, it will improve. Good small size and fairly easy to use, everything else is OK.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "CRG", "ReviewID": "R1IFUEC7ZTGHFR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this camera to take pictures of architecture models because of its small focal length. Basically, don't even try to take a picture inside, it will never look good, grainy, blurry, all the colors are completely wrong, it creates warmer tones even with the white balance set to cooler. Recently I've tried to set up simple timelapses, (10-12 pictures a day for a week) and it even fails at that! Although I'm using a tripod and self timer it still comes out grainy.If you are looking to use this camera for simple point and shoot photography it still sucks! The battery life is miniscule and the included charger takes over an hour to charge.In Conclusion: DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA there are many others on the market that will fair you better", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor battery life", "Author": "craig sommerfield", "ReviewID": "R19TDMCK6MEK7C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Olympus FE-20.  The battery life lasts maybe 2-3 pictures, and if you use the flash - then less. (my experience).  I would have taken it back, but I can't find the receipt. Went top the Olympus web site and I wasn't able to buy a replacement battery - actually I honestly believe that something is wrong with the mfg \"run\" that caused this problem. I went to \"Olympus FE-20 battery problems\" and I found other folks that are experiencing this same problem.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beats the Stores every time!", "Author": "Darren C.

And we were doing 20-30 mph on a slightly choppy water, the Image Stabilization works fantastic. We even took zoomed pictures of the kids on the tube behind the boat and I could not believe how good the pictures came out. We bought it elsewhere for under $100 and it is a great value for the money. It is nice and slim, I like the lens cover that closes automatically when you shut the camera off and the battery lasts quite awhile. I put a 2gb card in the camera and it says it will take over 500 pictures. The only thing you need to know is that the USB has to be plugged directly into the computer and not through a USB hub! At first I could not transfer images so I called Olympus and they explained this and when I plugged directly into the computer, it worked just fine. Highly recommended but shop around for deals.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Exactly as advertised", "Author": "Cuyler Griffith", "ReviewID": "R1CGFRCJDO1OA6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After some research on current camera offerings, I decided to go with this one.
