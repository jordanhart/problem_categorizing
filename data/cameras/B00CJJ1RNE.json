{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good starter package", "Author": "Darius Wiles", "ReviewID": "R2VS0VV53THUEA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as my first digital SLR camera. I wanted a longer lens from Canon, in addition to the one that comes by default with the Rebel SL1, and this package was a cost effective way of buying it. This is especially true considering the many other items which are included. These are of reasonable quality, based on the ones I have used so far and on Amazon reviews of the individual items, and I have found that they are plenty good enough for someone new to digital SLR photography. When I bought my camera there were many similar packages including this camera and different additional items, so have a look for similar packages if you are interested in this camera but no so keen on the additional items in this specific package.The camera itself is fantastic. I've owned a Canon point-and-shoot camera for several years, so the controls are familiar, though this camera has many more settings. The manual and other small booklets that are bundled with the camera do a good job of explaining the controls and when to use them to get the best pictures. The quality of the photos is great.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS Rebel SL1 Digital SLR Camera & EF-S 18-55mm IS STM Lens with... CANON", "Author": "Geraldine A.

I bought it for my wife for Christmas and the camera is a great camera for her.  It's smaller and super lightweight so it fits in her hands and she doesn't get uber tired holding it for photographs.  She took 3k during our volleyball tournament recently and the pictures were great.  She used the sport mode and got some pretty good pictures.  Only thing is the sport mode doesn't take pictures quite as fast as you might hope...missed a lot of perfect spikes with the hand on the ball (got the swing and follow through).  She's now taking a class to learn how to use it better and more effectively.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great value!", "Author": "Sunil Gajraj", "ReviewID": "R1G50HU6CUQUFG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was a really good package.

This is Cannon USA and the camera is the exact same as you'd get in a department store.  The remote is really nice too. I am a new DSLR user, and am excited to learn how to use everything. I really like the remote control feature for taking my own family pictures.  It's not the most responsive, but I managed to get a picture of me, my hubby, 3 month old son, and dog all looking at the camera by holding the remote button and taking about 50 pictures.
