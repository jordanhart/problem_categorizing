I took little over a hundred pictures before I had to change the batteries with my first use. The battery compartment is hard to get into to put batteries in, you have to find a tool to open it, but then you will not have to worry about the batteries falling out either. It is a bit dark when using inside without flash. I have not used video mode much. The video mode seems to require fully charged batteries. It took good enough pictures outside for a first time user own digital camera. I hope some day to be able to afford a digital camera that takes better pictures of the moon than this Vivitar 7022. The moon looked hazy. Over all, I think it is a good first time digital camera.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Quality same as price - CHEAP!!", "Author": "Philip M.

It sounded like horsehooves or a loud rumbling, so as a camcorder with sound this product was USELESS!  The picture quality was also worse than older 3 MP cameras I've had.  NOT worth the price!", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Vivitar Vivicam V7022 7.1MP Black HD Digital Camera Plus 4GB Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wW34N4TbL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003M64MJ4"}}
