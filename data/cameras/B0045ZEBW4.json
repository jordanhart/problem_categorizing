They take 2 AA batteries and use packfilm that you can buy from Amazon (search Fujifilm FP-100C). These pictures are way better than any other instant camera that I have ever seen. They are clear, they aren't tinged yellow, and they are really fun. These would be great during an outdoor party. Fully recommend these cameras for the utility. Artsy, vintage, hip, cool.FUJIFILM FP-100C 3.25 X 4.25 Inches Professional Instant Color FilmFUJIFILM FP-3000B 3.34 X 4.25 Inches Professional Instant Black and White Film", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Polaroid colorpack II", "Author": "Polaroid", "ReviewID": "R133ZH4N0QRFNM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It was in good condition I think before it was shipped.
