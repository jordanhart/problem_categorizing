My first was one of the very old Olypus digitals; no removable storage, just a cable to the computer, 120 low resolution or 30 medium resolution shots and then the memory was full.  The colors were always off, there was no zoom, and it was amazing that it worked at all.  No wonder I also bought a pocket 35mm camera to take \"real\" pictures since the Olympus' were so small, grainy, and colorless.  At least the 35mm had a datestamp option.  3 years later I bought the Canon PowerShot S30, then when I lost it (or had it stolen?) I replaced it with the S40.  The PowerShot S50 sold today is the same body style with more pixels and a couple of annoyances fixed.This camera is NOTHING like those cameras.  I had plenty of complaints about the S30 & S40.  My biggest gripe was missing the shot.  I take pictures of children, especially at school functions.  I would line up a wonderful shot, push the button... and they would move!  They'd get up and walk away, they'd turn around, they'd crowd into the subject, I was missing 80% of my shots.  About a year later, the shutter would finally click.  So my hard drive is filled with so-so shots that would have been winners if that annoying delay hadn't gotten me... again!No problem with the Digital Rebel.  Press the button, focus is lightning-fast, then click goes the shutter.  You look through the viewfinder to frame your shot, not at the back on those hard-to-read LCD screens.  Several modes allow multiple pictures, just in case, such as in Sports mode. I am seeing such an improvement in my pictures since I got this camera a few weeks ago.  First of all, they are always framed properly, because I'm not dealing with sudden motion after shutter release, nor am I dealing with an LCD for a viewfinder, or a \"viewfinder\" that makes me correct for parallax.  Next, the colors are amazing.  Third, 6.3 megapixels... when would I ever want that much?  When I want to crop 80% of the picture and still print what's left!It is great to have a camera with some heft that still doesn't feel like a brick.  As everyone else says, get the kit lens.  It is 18 to 55mm, so a nice wide-angle lens for group shots, etc.  I find 55mm not close enough for shooting children; the S30/S40 I mention above has an 11-55mm range which I already knew to be insufficient for shooting kids. Thus I bought the Canon 28-200mm zoom lens and keep that one on the camera, only switching to the kit lens when I do big groups or a lot of similar portraits (that big zoom lens weighs four times as much as the body!) Yes, it is an amazing camera for \"under\" $1000.  Truth be told, I spent more than that on accessories; the 28-200mm lens was almost $500, with 6.3 megapixels you might as well buy the biggest flashcard you can, and that's 2 GB these days; you'll need a case, you really ought to buy skylight filters to protect those lenses from getting scratched, an extra battery is a really good idea... well, you see what I mean.Still an amazing camera, especially after dealing with those tiny toys for all these years.", "Date": "November 10, 2003"}, {"Title": "Thinking about a move from 35mm EOS?  Buy This!!", "Author": "mister_t42", "ReviewID": "RADYW26V17WA6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned three digital cameras before this (a very small Sony, a Canon G1, and an older Kodak), and have been impressed with instant feedback received by viewing your photo 2 seconds after you took it, but was always left with the feeling that I needed to be able to change lenses and have more control over the process.What I really wanted was my old Canon EOS 650 (35mm) camera to work with a digital camara back so that I could make use of my existing investment in lenses.  Well guess what, that is exactly what the Digital Rebel provides!Much to my surprise, all of my old EOS EF lenses work very well with this camera and I am getting much better results than I expected.  This is a huge improvement over my other digicams - better resolution, color, overall quality, and I am in awe of what I get with my long telephoto lens.A few notes.  First, buy the kit lens (18-55mm EF-S); for $100 you'll use the lense and it is an incredible value (certinaly worth 2 to 3 times the cost).  Second, if you take many indoor photos you'll want an external flash; I went with Canon's 420EX unti as it provides E-TTL exposure (essentially, the amount of flash is controlled by what the camera meters through the lens - a pretty amazing capability).  Third, get a good amount of memory, like 2 512K card; its relatively inexpensive and by taking lots of photos you'll learn more about the camera's abilities sooner.I am getting very long battery life (well into many hundreds of photos per charge), so unless you are headed off into the woods you may be able to hold off on purchasing a spare battery.  In summary, if you are an old 35mm EOS photographer, this is a complete no brainer since you get to use your lens investment.  If you aren't, I'd highly recommend this camera anyway (and look into the Canon 70-200mm/f4 telephoto lense - its extremely high quality and a reasonable price).

It is my first SLR, though fortunately my third digicam, and ... well, wow, what a great camera to learn on.I'd like to just run down the \"cons\" listed by a different reviewer below (or above? how do they order these things? ;-):- \"to minimize cannibalization of 10D sales, the 300D has been pre-programmed to have less flexibility (forced AI focus, forced evaluative metering, etc)\"  * This general point is true, but it is rarely an issue for me, at least. You can override evaluative metering, you can fool it into Servo AF mode (and the \"sports mode\" pushes it into Servo AF mode as well), etc. The only thing I miss is mirror lock-up, for long-exposure dusk shots ... but hey, that just isn't worth the $600 and .75 pound tax I'd pay for the 10D.- no spot metering.  * Not true. Locking exposure (holding the '*' button) yields spot metering in most modes, though the \"spot\" is about 9% of the FoV. - low noise levels at ISO 1600.  * The Rebel has the same sensor and image processing goo as the 10D, and the 10D reputatedly has some of the lowest noise at any given ISO. ISO 1600 is pretty darn fast, some noise is inevitable.- no flash exposure compensation.  * Yeah, this stinks a bit -- but at least you can get it with one of the EX flashes.- cannot fine-tune white balance.  * Not sure what \"fine tune\" means here -- you can set it to \"Custom white balance\" and read off of a white source (e.g. white card, paper), and it retains that custom setting (even through on/off cycles of the camera). - make sure you don't open the memory door while the camera is writing into the flash memory or else you will lose everything that's left in the internal memory buffer.  * Never have run into this being an issue -- opening the memory door is quite an unnatural action, I can't really see it ever happening accidentally, and the big red flashing light would be a reminder not to do it intentionally.- plastic body with compartment doors that should be meatier.  * Metal (zinc) would be heavier, and the Rebel is plenty durable -- I crashed my mountain bike at 20mph with this sucker on my hip. I rolled onto it and cracked the filter, bent the lens, but the body was only scratched a little, and continues to work perfectly.- LCD has no anti-reflective coating.  * My theory has always been that you can't see diddly on the LCD anyway. The real benefit on the 300D is that you can set the pic review mode to show the \"info\" screen, which includes the histogram -- this is VERY useful for checking to see if you have the exposure right without having to squint at a tiny LCD screen and guessing. - reduced continuous shooting rate and buffer size (2.5 fps for max 4 images) vs the 10D.  * Again, another thing you get with the additional $600 ... but compared to the other digicams I've owned, this one feels like a rocket!- ISO sensitivity not displayed on viewfinder status bar while being changed.  * It is displayed on the external LCD, however. I do wish that it was always visible on the LCD (not just when changing), as it's a little too easy to set it to, say, 400 in some low light situation, and then forget it's there and only remember when you note, several days later, that \"wow, that shutter speed sure is short ...\"- no flash memory provided so add a few $$ to your budget to get at least 128MB.  * Included flash cards are virtually always too small and basically get tossed.- proprietary battery - again, a few more bucks for a spare.  * Are there any \"large\" cameras that take, say, AA's? Not many ... the BP-512 that the Rebel uses is a SWEET battery, too, in terms of life.", "Date": "October 23, 2003"}, {"Title": "C'mon, join the revolution... it'll feel real good!", "Author": "R. Shumskis \"highlandbob\"", "ReviewID": "RKQZDW6KUGQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been intrigued by this camera since its release.  My old camera is a Canon PowerShot S30 (3.2MP).  I wanted to buy an SLR to advance my photography skills and capabilities.  When this beauty came along bearing a price tag under $1,000 and received prestigious acclaim I knew I wanted one.  But I decided to delay for a few months, waiting to see what competition would arise, and how quickly the price would drop.  That competition presented itself as the Nikon D70.  Ultimately, I decided to get the D-Rebel because the price-to-quality ratio is exceptional; the ~$300+ more for the Nikon doesn't seem justifiable for what I think are negligible factors.  Besides, my PowerShot has served me well and I'm used to the Canon system.I've played with mine in the field for two days.  Last weekend was my introduction day and I made a lot of mistakes -- camera shake, off-focus, underexposure.  Today I went back to the same spots [in similar weather] and received much better results by using my tripod, setting the exposure compensation to +1/3 (most of the time) and sometimes forcing a longer shutter than 'auto' suggested.  My photos went from dull to incredible with a few easy adjustments.  If your photos come out poorly always exhaust the manual solutions before blaming faulty camera construction.If you're moving up from a [Canon] SLR, many of the characteristics of the D-Rebel will be familiar.  If, on the other hand, you're used to a P&S like myself some things will be awkward.  For example, using the viewfinder instead of the LCD monitor to compose shots; using the Main Dial and LCD panel to implement settings; and manual focusing.  My PowerShot allows manual tweaking, but it is usually easier to let the processor handle certain functions.  The SLR is different -- it invites you to play.I have read complaints about the camera's construction.  Indeed, it is an all-plastic body, whereas the D-Rebel's big brother, the 10D, is magnesium alloy.  But I think this will be an insignificant point for most people; the plastic body is sturdy enough to handle a day's work.  It has a nice firm rubber grip on the right side.  A friend has an EOS Elan 7 (n or ne) and the weight is approximately the same.I also know some people don't like the fact that the D-Rebel uses the flash as an AF-assist lamp -- particularly because once the flash pops it will take a flash exposure.  But the solution is simple enough:  push the flash back down.  The camera automatically re-evaluates the shutter speed, maintains focus and takes the shot.  You will need to have it on a tripod for the shot to be successful, though.After a lot of reading and searching for components to make up a great system, I ended up buying:  Rebel with 18-55mm lens; EF 55-200mm II USM lens; 1 Gb Sandisk Ultra II CompactFlash; 420EX Speedlite flash; Sto-fen Omni-Bounce diffuser (for 420EX); Tiffen 58mm Deluxe Enhancing Filter Kit; Samsonite Worldproof 3.2 Download SLR bag; Tamrac Small Lens Case.  (I wrote a review for the Samsonite bag.  I think it's fantastic for carrying all my gear.  I use the Tamrac bag when I want to travel light.)Here's a stupid mistake I made that I'd like to enlighten others to, so that they may avoid doing the same.  When I first tested the camera most of my shots were indoors and required the flash.  In many of those shots I noticed a black blob.  I thought maybe my flash was defective.  The manual says there are certain conditions where the flash may be obstructed.  My solution was simple enough:  two of my fingers were in the way.  With my PowerShot, I had become used to lifting my ring and pinky fingers away from the flash and lens so they would be out of the way... now doing it put them in the way of the flash.  Sometimes the simplest answer is the right one.Here are two things I feel quite fortunate to have learned (i.e., stumbled upon), as I did not read this in any review.  (1) When using a [Canon] digital SLR you need a \"Type II\" lens.  Lenses have always induced aberrations of light, which would create 'ghosts' and other weird things.  But 35mm film is produced with a coating that prevents them.  When you use a D-SLR, however, that coating is not on your sensor, so those light artifacts appear again.  So Canon created the \"Type II\" lens, where the aforementioned coating is on the glass.  The only problem is that there are only a handful of these lenses at this point.  Unfortunately, this dramatically weakens Canon's claim that you can use \"over 50 lenses\" on your D-Rebel.  While technically true, you probably wouldn't like the results.  (Popular Photography magazine ran an article about this, which is on their site.)  (2) Don't fall for tricky CompactFlash advertising.  I bought several Viking Components CF cards for my PowerShot.  They always worked well and I almost bought a big one for my D-Rebel.  Then I considered the Lexar \"40x\" because they have a good reputation. \"40x\" sounds good, eh?  The Sandisk Ultra II works at 60x!  At the Large-Fine setting, this will save you one-third second of write-time.  That is big when you think about action photography.  The Sandisk card can write 3 images when the Lexar can only do 2.  The Vikings are worse; they can't even write one image/second!I am exceptionally pleased with my purchase -- not with just the D-Rebel, but the whole system.  It pays to do your research and decide what's right for you.  Personally, I think I put together an excellent 'amateur SLR' package that will allow me to grow and explore for a long time.  Hopefully you will feel the same with a D-Rebel over your shoulder.", "Date": "June 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "Superlative camera", "Author": "R. GollobinLightstruck Images \"Ron Gollobin/L...", "ReviewID": "R2YOJXOW59ZNY9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a semi-pro photographer and have used high-end Canon film cameras for years.  I bought the Digital Rebel about four months ago and have been absolutely delighted with it.  One of the most amazing things about it is the number of shots on a battery charge (Li-ion) with the flash.  I use two 512 MB Compact Flash cards and I can fill one of them up in a session on a single charge and can start on the second flash card.One proviso:  The 18-55mm lens that comes with the kit is excellent--it is light and versatile.  However, most of my shooting is done with the Canon 28-70mm 'L' lens which is a professional, high quality, very fast lens with incredible resolution.  This lens is also much heavier and the large lens barrel partially blocks the little pop-up flash.I have set up my film cameras on a tripod and side by side, shot Velvia film using the same lenses and subject, along with the Digital Rebel.  While the saturation of the digital images is not as pronounced as with Velvia film, the detail is quite similar.  Very few editors could spot which image was Velvia, except for the color saturation.  Otherwise quality is comparable.For demanding pro work, photographers will probably want more than the 6.3 MP of the Rebel.  For me, it is absolute heaven.  My marketable shots are heavily composed and lit. Getting instant feedback, even on the small monitor is just heaven.I see no drawbacks for the Digital Rebel.  If  you are a casual snap shooter, or more advanced, prepare to be wowed.One additional note:  I made a great shot--good enough for a poster--so I had Kinko's make a 2' x 3' poster from this shot.  The poster was only 200% of the original and there was absolutely no discernable pixelation.  Simply incredible!I am a tough judge of photographic equipment, but Canon got nearly all of this camera right.  The sensor, metering, auto white balance,bracketing,lack of shutter lag, auto power shut-off are so consumer friendly and common sense right out of the box, I was bowled over.  The more sophisticated controls are available too, when I want them.This is one tremendous product.  My biggest complaint is the interface is USB 1.0 and downloading to a computer is slow.

I already owned canon lenses and a flash.  for those complaining or concerned about money that has to be spent on lenses,well thats the fundamental question of is a camera with interchangalbe lens right for you.Pros:  No delay in taking pics.  2.5 fps. 6.3 MP.  Interchangable lens.  I found focusing to be perfectly accurate and fast. recomend disabling the 7 point focusing, and switch to center, with recomposing picture. as for those complaining that pictures arenot Sharp or lively, that is a function of two things.  First the lens being used.  the stock lens is good, but not great.  A little slow. I took a lot of pictures with an 80 dollar 50 mm, f 1.8 lens,  including in candle light, and bright day light, and the results are amazing.  second thing is processing of the pictures.  the camera has 3 preset processings for \"sharpness\" and saturation and contrast, as well as 3 custom ones, so you can make your pics as sharp,  saturated, and contrasty as you desire. learn to use to camera. I found the camera to be excellent up to iso setting of 800, ,with minimal noise, with better quality than film camer.  I also like the palstic construction.  its lighter, and nicer to carry.

I was annoyed w/ the fixed lens that prevented me from taking good photos of wildlife. I have hummingbird feeders in my backyard and unless you've had the opportunity to work with hummingbird families for years, the sweet, tiny animals are skittish and don't often pose for you when you get too close. When my point-n-shoot stopped focusing, I took advantage of this situation by rationalizing this bigger purchase.What a joy it has been to use this camera. The 6.3MP is a significant improvement over 5 and the ability to take photos in manual mode cannot be understated. With the fixed point-n-shoot, the camera refused to shoot if it didn't \"feel\" that it was in focus... so it was impossible to shoot sunsets, lightning or other natural beauties in the \"infinity\" range of the focal length.The Rebel makes use of Compact Flash - the oldest, yet still the best technology for taking fast, high-quality photos in digital cameras.My less than perfect rating is due to the small memory buffer. You can take up to 3fps very easily, but if you click-click-click the shutter, it doesn't matter if Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster and Elvis start doing a little soft-shoe right in front of you, by the time the Rebel finishes writing the recent 3 quick shots to the CF card, the shot of the century has already slithered back into the swamp by the time the camera is ready to be used again.If you're taking portraits, not a problem. A click here and there and you'll never notice the lack of memory buffer... but if you're shooting at a ball game or other quick moving objects, you're going to get frustrated very quickly.The flash is decent, but you really need a good flash like the 580 in the hot-shoe if you want a better even spread and avoidance of red-eye. A lot of folks shrug about red-eye since most affordable or free programs like iPhoto or Photoshop Elements have built-in correction for red-eye - but red-eye correction by one click is only available for humans. If you're shooting wildlife, forget about any software that has a one-click (or a million clicks!) solution for blue-eye in dogs, yellow-eye in cats, flaming-demon eye in bunnies or the variety of odd reflections you will get bouncing off retinas of various species. The best way to circumvent this problem is to avoid bouncing flash directly into the retinas of your subjects from the get-go. No more glare or odd reflections when you use a better flash.The ability to upgrade to better lenses is the crux of SLR ownership. The sky is the limit. Get a good wide-angle and a good, fast telephoto and you've got yourself set for some great shots.  This camera isn't going to take advantage of CF cards faster than 40x, so you can save money by buying the slightly slower CF cards, but I invested in the 80x cards so I can use them when I upgrade cameras.This Rebel has gotten me back into photography after a decade-long hiatus. The camera automatically detects vertical shots and turns them 90 degrees for you in the LCD window. It is quick and easy to adjust the ISO to \"push\" the film (so to speak) to take advantage of low-light situations, but you get the same grainy effects as you do when you push real film.With an ISO of 100 and using a 512MB CF card, you have 157 photos at your disposal - if you push it all the way to 1600, 104 shots on the same card. At 400, your shots are already compromized regarding print quality... but if Sasquatch comes-a-knockin' in the wee hours, you'll still get decent proof if you shoot at 1600.Having a background in film photography spanning 2 decades, I didn't even have to consult the manual for this camera to use it fresh out of the box. It handles in many ways like a professional film SLR, and unlike the point-n-shoots, there aren't cryptic settings that have no film parallel.For sunny days and outdoor shots, this camera is a sheer joy to use.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "Sweet digital camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1NQCO1IEK8R6J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all this camera's price point marks a first in the digital SLR field.  I would recommend this camera for someone that is tired of missing shots waiting for your CCD based digital camera to recycle.  The cycle time with flash is at the most 1.8 seconds unless you have 4 or more pictures waiting to be spooled to the flash card.  This is slower than other more expensive digital SLR's, but is FASTER than every non-SLR digital camera I have seen.The battery life is remarkable to say the least of any other digital camera I have seen.  The proprietary battery caused me a little concern, but it has such a rich history with Canon's other digital SLR's and PowerShot models, I felt comfortable.  The battery just keeps on going and going too.  I hope this battery can continue to perform like thes for several years down the road.  When the advertisement states that you can get 300-400 pictures out of one battery, BELIEVE IT..  I intentionally ran the battery down one day and I would swear that I took somewhere around 500 pictures (90% of them using the flash) before the battery finally gave up.  I have a 512mb flash card and it filled it up more than twice on the SAME battery..The fit and finish left a little to be desired at first with the plastic body.  I have come accustomed to using it and even though it's made out of plastic, I would like to see someone do a drop test to see how the case holds up against another digital SLR with a metal body.  My money's on the injection molded Digital Rebel (if there is such a thing as SOLID plastic, this is it)..If purchasing this camera, be sure to get Canon's SLR accessory pack for 69.95 and BestBuy (and others maybe).  This pack contains an extra battery and a 58mm Canon UV lens.  I use it on my lens as a permanent protector.  The battery alone costs around 60 bucks and you get a bag and a filter to boot..Some folks have complained that indoor photography sucks with this camera.  DON'T believe everything you read!!  I thought this at first, but when I set the camera in the P mode it allowed me to adjust the ISO level and indoor photography improved instantly.  I will agree that the full auto mode should be used sparingly indoors.  Now I have to worry about having pictures that are overexposed inside.  No need for a mini studio as someone mentioned..  Just play with the camera for a while and you will learn so much.  Besides this is digital..  You can see your mistakes before paying for processing..Also, plan to purchase some other lenses (that's why you purchased a digital SLR to begin with, right).  I purchased a 75-300 from BestBuy off their clearance rack (for a ridiciulous price for a Canon EF lens) and the lens works great.  If you're good with the ISO settings and the program mode, you can take indoor shots with the zoom at full tilt!  And speaking of zoom capability..  The focal point of the 75-300 lens actually has to go through the 1.6 magnification factor..  So to the camera the effective focal length of the 75-300 lens is actually 120 - 480 zoom.  Sweet..I haven't taken the camera to any sporting events and it gets dark so early now, I only have time to do daytime photography on the weekends.  The amount of correction in the automatic mode works good for daytime photography.The software on the PC for the camera was a little different at first.  My last camera just hooked up to the computer and presented a file folder of images for download/review.  The Canon software provides far more information about the camera, and all of the elements that went into making the picture.  This has been very helpful for me to determine exactly which light balances to use for the best shots.  I have also tried the direct capture to the computer and it rocks!!  It told me I had like 11,000 shots left to take using the hard drive of the computer to transfer images..  I will say the USB connection between the software and the camera is a little slow.  I wish this camera had a USB2.0 connection for faster speed, but hey no other digital-SLR offers that for ANY price (as far as I know)..  I would certainly leave some money in the budget for a CF reader that works on USB 2.0..  About $45..In closing, I find this camera to be a very good value for the money and look forward to other times I can do some creative photography.  Availability for this camera may be a little scarce, but if you have to wait, I feel it will be well worth it.  I have a friend that has a full EOS 35mm outfit complete with a few lenses, flashes, etc..  It may be time to play Lets Make A Deal since all of his components are (1) authentic Canon accessories, and (2) the Digital Rebel can use some older accessories..Happy hunting..", "Date": "December 4, 2003"}, {"Title": "Excellent Digital SLR for Canon Lens owners", "Author": "P. Jackson", "ReviewID": "R1YRQC3TOPX9T1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first affordable (i.e. <$1000) slr digital camera and although there are some compromises, it produces excellent pictures. Some care is needed to familiarise yourself with exposure modes and focusing. The default settings tend to produce slightly underexposed pcitures, but this is easily corrected.The lack of spot metering in Program and Auto mode is irritating and can cause issues. Also note that the so called spot metering mode used in the \"creative\" settings is not as a good as that in, say, the Elan. Indoor photography is tricky due to the lack of true wide angle lenses. Your 35mm lenses end up with an equivalent focal length x 1.6 which effectively means the resolution (after cropping and enlargement) is reduced. Not too bad for smaller prints but a compromise nevertheless.The camera is very fast and shutter lag is minimal, a major issue with point and shoot cameras (from my point of view this is a primary reason - along with the interchangeable lenses -for buying a SLR digital)Despite its slightly \"cheesy\" appearance, it is well built and operates with a good quality feel.If you are Canon lens user/owner this is a no brainer at the price. If you do not have any lenses, look at the Nikon 100D and new Pentax before you make your choice.", "Date": "November 21, 2003"}, {"Title": "Don't have one?

The 10D was already a bargain, this camera is $600 less with 99% of the features. Don't let the plastic exterior fool you, the interior frame is all metal, and just as durable as the 10D.I've taken thousands of photos since getting this camera for Christmas, and it has done everything I've wanted it to do. As an old film SLR shooter, I'm happy to have an actual TTL viewfinder again. This has been my biggest gripe with digital cameras with \"Electronic View Finders\"--having to deal with parallax, poor viewfinder image (manual focus becomes a guessing game), slow shutter response, etc. Have all kept me away from digital cameras.  All of these are non-issues with the D. Rebel, it's just like using a film SLR, and at under $1000, what's not to like?A camera is no better than its lens, so we come to the one \"down side\" of buying this camera: to make proper use of it, you must spend even more money on good optics. This is something to keep in mind when making a purchasing decision: you'll probably spend at least as much on optics as you did on the camera body.I suspect many of the poor reviews from this camera are the result of using the kit EF-S 18-55 lens (or some other cheap, similarly poor-performing lens). There are probably worse lenses out there, but you'd have to search far and wide to find one. The camera performs way better than this lens does.Still, The EF-S 18-55 that comes with the kit is worth holding on to. I would recommend keeping the kit lens in your bag for those occasions where you need a wide-angle lens, like group shots. Otherwise, keep it off your camera! If you find yourself taking lots of wide-angle shots, you should seriously consider investing in a good wide-angle lens like the EF 17-40 f/4 L USM. Sell the kit 18-55 lens on Ebay--you'll get about $75-$100 for it--to help defray the cost.An EF 50 f/1.8 USM is a must-have. For $70-$80, you get an excellent lens for portraits and indoor shooting. Don't let the cheap plastic construction fool you, this is one of the better 50mm lenses out there. Remember that the camera has 1.6x cropping, so the 50mm lens produces the same image size as an 80mm lens on a 35mm film camera, which is a good focal length for portraits.A good every-day lens is the EF 28-135 f/3.5-5.6 IS USM, for about $450. A good second choice would be the EF 28-105 /f3.5-4.5 (NOT the f/4-5.6, which is junk, in my opinion), for about $250. You'll find yourself taking 60% to 80% of your pictures with this mid-range zoom lens, so don't skimp. You should really get the better quality 28-135 if you can manage it.If you'll be taking lots of telephoto shots, the EF 70-200 f/4L USM is a bargain at about $550-one of the lowest-priced \"L\" lenses. If that's out of your price range, go with the EF 100-300 f/4.5-5.6 USM, for about $275, which is superior to any of the EF 75-300 f/4-5.6 offerings, unless you really need IS, which is not offered on the 100-300. Stay away from the EF 55-200 f/4.5-5.6 USM, it's no better than the kit lens, in my opinion.Getting good images requires good optics, making the camera more expensive than the initial $999 purchase price.

To my delight, I found that the manual had nothing to teach me about using the camera that I hadn't already learned by using the menu displayed on the LCD screen.  I found the buttons to be very intuitive, especially since I have owned several digital cameras.  The first accessory I purchased was a 512 mb ultra-fast CF card, so that the camera would not be hindered by a slow transfer to media.  This has paid off well, as I do alot of sports photography in burst mode.  The camera does an amazing job of capturing fast action with crystal clear continuous focusing.  (I should mention that the lens I am using is a 28-200mm)  Battery life is great, and if you keep your LCD review time to a minimum, you should get hundreds of pictures on one charge.  The flash also seems to be very strong, I have not been disappointed yet, but an accessory flash can be added if necessary.  The camera is definitely weightier than any digital I have owned, but I was not looking for something to slip into my pocket.

The single most annoying artifact of many digital cameras is shutter latency. Press the button, wait... Wait...snip! A second can be an eternity for many shots and sometimes the moment will never return, especially if you have children. You can't put a price tag on shots lost due to shutter latency.The Canon Digital Rebel has no perceptible shutter latency. Plus, the shutter is an electromagnetic release so something tangible, physical happens when you press the shutter button. This would be true for any SLR. The camera makes a satisfying 'kerchunk' sound when you take a picture, and that sound is real, not a sample or beep coming out of a speaker. With some digital cameras, there is little or no feedback indicating you took a picture at all.There are other aspects to this camera that make it ideal for capturing shots that may not last:1) a real power switch - not a soft switch that you have to hold down for several seconds before the unit powers on. Some cameras you also have to wait for the lens to pop out. Gah!2) EF lens zoom - quick, direct hand-held zoom adjustment - not a small lever that drives a motor that changes the zoom - almost worthless under many situations. ...and of course the shutter. All of this means you can reach for the camera, flick it on and snap a photo in seconds. Obviously, this is not a pocket camera. There are many good models that provide this functionality, I own one myself, but the features inherent to the 300D are mutually exclusive to that of a pocket camera. It is pretty hefty, too - it weighs more than my 35mm Rebel SLR. I've read some people bring the durability of the plastic body into question. Modern composites offer durability at a fraction of the weight of metal.

But a couple of years ago, I wanted to make the switch to digital.  The Canon digital SLRs were out of my price range ($3K to start), so I purchased a Powershot G2 digital point and shoot, which I loved, but my lenses sat unused in my closet.Well, I fret no more as Canon came out with the much more affordable Digital Rebel for under $1,000 and I finally took the plunge.  A great decision.  Now I can use my lenses.  I have a 50mm 1.8 (word of advice - if you don't have it yet, get this lens - the best $80 you'll spend on your hobby), 28-135mm Image stabilizer and a 75-300mm zoom along with the 18-55mm kit lens that came with the Digital Rebel.  This along with the 380EX flash that I have had for 5+ years give me the arsenal to take good shots in most conditions.  You can set ISO to 800 or 1600 to get clear indoor shots or sports action, and the noise associated with these settings is much more acceptable to me than the 400 ISO setting provided on my G2.  And as far as portraits go, combine the 50mm lens with the flash and I've taken some of the best face shots in my life.Also making me happy is that Rebel takes the same battery as the G2, so I use my G2 battery plus the Rebel battery along with the two extras I bought), meaning I should never run out of power (what helps with battery life is that unlike the G2, you can't use the display monitor to frame the picture, you must use the viewfinder).  Plus the camera takes Compact Flash cards, again like the G2, so I don't have to spend on new memory.If I have a gripe, is that some pictures come out a tad underexposed even with the flash, but this is generally remedied in image software.

Even with all the features, I find this camera to be easier to use than most DC's I've played with and have owned (see below for list).  The size and price might be a bit much for some, but I really don't mind either.  I have HP R507 as my \"pocket camera\", but I always find excuses to take the canon with me every where I go!Picture quality:  EXCELLENT.  I'm a novice photographer, but with the benefit of this being digital, it's helping me learn a lot about photography that I didn't have the patience to wait for developing the film.  With the digital rebel, I don't have to wait to see how my \"experimental\" shots come out.  I've taken some cool over exposure shots of traffic at night, and it was VERY easy to do!  Other pictures I've taken come out as good as (if not better than) my Canon 35mm Rebel 2000.  I don't foresee needing/wanting to enlarge my pictures more than 8x10, and with the canon 80-200mm zoom (which becomes 128-320mm on the digital rebel wich 1.6x factor), I should be able to accomplish pretty much any shots I'd ever want.Features:  EXCELLENT (still camera only).  I don't believe in Video feature in DC's to be something useful, at least not until MPEG4 or other higher compression becomes more widely used.  Right now, you can only cram 20 minutes of 320x240 video into 256MB card (less if you go 640x480), so to me, that's not useful.  If you want to take videos, you really should get a video camera.  I especially like that digital rebel goes to ISO 1600 which makes taking night shots much easier!Battery life:  EXCELLENT.  As a test, I took enough pictures to fill a 512MB CF card, about 150 pictures, mostly with flash, some without.  Battery was still barely 1/2 down.  Included fast charger is a nice touch, it has an LED indicator to let you known that the battery is 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 and fully charged.  So in a pinch you could charge just till 1/2 charged (15-30 minutes charge time) and then keep shooting.  But I don't think I'll be taking more than 150 pictures in a day, so I'm opting to not get the backup battery.Cost:  EXCELLENT (for me).  \"It's soooo choice!  If you have the means, I'd highly recommend you get one of those\" - Ferris Bueller.  For some, the price maybe a bit of a shock.

It seems clear that Canon has aimed this camera primarily at novices.  Its point and shoot are as simple as you will find on any consumer compact digicam.  Its creative setting should offer enough control and flexibility to keep most intermediate and advance photographers happy.  First though lets go over some of the complaints people are writing about the camera.1).  I can't set up my photo through the LCD-----No you surely can't.  SLR's are designed specifically to direct the light and image from the lens to the view finder.  To the best of my knowledge, there is not a true digital SLR which allows you to do this.  And there shouldn't be.  You can keep the camera a lot more steady and get a much better view of what your image will look like through the view finder then you ever could looking at an LCD six to eight inches from your body.2).  Complaint number two is just as silly.  Canon does not include a CF card with the camera.  I've yet to see a digital SLR manufacturer that includes any media with the camera.  Also when you consider that about the only card they could include without affecting the price much is a 128mb card with is next to useless in a camera like this.Now to some more reasonable complaints1).  This camera is slow to start up (compared to many current DSLR's by Canon and Nikon).  There really was not much that Canon could have done about that.  It uses the same first generation DIGIC processing chip and same 6.3mp CMOS as the Canon D10.  The D10 has similar short comings.  If you can't live with this (about 3 seconds from power up till you can take a photo) you might want to consider the new Rebel XT or D20.  You'll also have to decide if the extra responsiveness is worth an extra 200-300.00 bucks.2).  For continuous shooting you only get 2.5PFS and 4 frame bursts.  Much of this is also do to the DIGIC.  The D10 isn't much faster (though it does have a larger buffer (the images are stored in the buffer before they can be written to your media) which does allow it to continue shooting while the dRebel is catching its breath.  I was very much aware of this \"Shortcoming\" before I bought the camera and understand it as a cost cutting method (larger buffers cost more money) and decided to accept this short coming rather then pay an extra 200-300. bucks.3).  Canon has crippled the camera by removing many manual control features(through software-The camera is physically able to carry out many of these functions but Canon removed the ability by programing the DIGIC chip (the firmware) to disallow these features.  Clearly a business decision and one that make some sense.  You really would not want to release a low cost camera with all the same features as your higher end camera.  On the other hand, I really wished they would have kept some of the features they removed (like the ability for the user to adust the flash settings).4).  I can't shoot RAW images in the automatic settings.  I can understand this.  Most of the people using the fully automatic settings are probably novices.  RAW images cannot be printed from the camera directly to a printer.  RAW images require quite a bit of post shooting work before they're usable.  If some one that really does not know much about photography were to shoot a couple of hundred RAW images they would be pretty upset when they found out they could not print their images and didn't know how to change that.5).  The Nikon D70 supports higher ISO's then the Canon.  The ISO adjusts the camera's sensitivity to light (on film cameras it's the film speed).  My answer to that is that the D70 does not support an ISO of 100 and the dRebel does.  Personally, I would much rather have an ISO range of 100-1600 like the dRebel then an ISO range of 200-3200.  The higher the ISO setting the more digital noise you're likely to get and an ISO of 3200 would seem to affect you're quality considerably.  On the other hand, Canon's 100 ISO is perfect for bright sunny days.I'm sure I missed some other complaints though I'm not sure what they are.  To sum it up, this is a very easy camera to use even for a novice.  The controls to adjust your camera settings and image quality are very easy to use and very intuitive.  If you do understand photo editing are really want to shoot RAW images but don't want to have to manually set all the camera settings (aperture, shutter speed etc.), the P-AE mode only requires that you set the ISO which is  very simple (keep it as low as light conditions allow while retaining a high shutter speed).  My main complaint is lack of documentation for include software (particularly the File viewer App which is required for converting RAW images).  Granted downloading the PDF's from Canon's web site is not a problem but it should not be necessary.Overall, an excellent camera for its intended consumer.  The camera has all the image quality that the pros have come to expect from Canon's digital SLR's.  The auto focus is very fast and accurate (especially compare to compact point and shoot cameras).  The shutter lag is virtually non existent so when you press the shutter release it pretty much instantly shoots so you won't miss the shot (again unlike the vast majority of compact P&S; which seem to take forever from the time you depress the shutter from the time it actually goes.  One quick piece of advise whether you get this camera or the Rebel XT.  Get the 18-55mm lens.  For the money this is an excellent wide a angle lens, and it is only available with the camera.Edit to review.  I wanted to add that I was incorrect concerning lack of documentation for the software suite included with the camera.  The camera does indeed come with full and complete documentation.  In addition, for those interested in shooting RAW, Canon's File Viewer which is included with the camera is less then stellar.  If, like me, you can't afford or justify the cost for Photoshop CS or the any number of RAW converters out there (most that cost over 100.00) you can head over to Canon's website and download Canon's new Digital Photo Professional.  This is the RAW converter included with Canon's high-end cameras (and the dRebel XT).  It is a free download and is vastly superior to File Viewer.  It is much more intuitive, has a far better interface, is much faster and most importantly (at least to me) it allows you to perform corrections in real time so you can make changes on the fly.  It has much better white balance control, and allows you to easily adjust hue and saturation, and lightness and contrast all while the file is in a RAW format.  The only down side is that you cannot download the images to Digital Photo Professional directly from the camera as you can with File Viewer.  You must either download from a card reader, or download using another application (such as Image Browser (included with the camera.", "Date": "April 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great features at a great price", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R25691N2R0WPSW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera.

For the former, the camera is pretty much all you need; for the latter, it is lacking key functionality, but IS workable.I'm in the latter category. I've done freelance photo work in the past, but not since the digital age began to take off in the late '90s. I've been shooting EOS cameras since the early '90s, and added medium format in the late '90s for wedding and portrait work. I'll be honest: I didn't like the idea of digital at first. Sure, the workflow improvements over film sounded great, but I wasn't seeing the quality of digital vs. film. I still am very much a believer that, at least for prints, especially big prints, film delivers a better overall picture quality. But the quality of digital SLRs since the release of the Digital Rebel is so good, the workflow advantages trump film in all but rare situations. I'll still use my medium format equipment for landscape and outdoor pics I'll print large and frame, but other than a pocket 35mm, I can't see using film much at all in that category, after seeing what I can do with the DReb.If you are primarily an amateur who is either used to using a Point and Shoot (film or digital) or who has used a consumer film SLR, you'll find this camera easy to operate and use to the extent you used your other cameras. I bought this without the lens, as I have other lenses and the packaged one didn't offer me anything, but for those without Canon glass, you get a surprisingly good lens with the kit. Remember, though, that the lens will only fit on the Digital Rebel, its successors, and possibly the 10/20D line of Canon EOS bodies.Shooting is pretty simple. Charge the battery, which is easy -- the charger blinks depending upon its charge. You can look at the charger with the battery on there and see where you are, charge wise. It doesn't take very long to charge the battery fully. Once you have the battery in the camera, you'll need a Compact Flash card. I recommend SanDisk Ultra II cards. You won't experience any write time problems over an above this camera's natural limitations. Then, set the ISO value (100-1600), set either the pre-programed mode on one side of the dial, or the traditional Program/Shutter Priority/Apeture Priority settings on the other side, and you are ready to rock. Remember that unlike many digital cameras, the LED on the back of the camers DOES NOT function as a viewfinder. Aside from displaying various camera options, it shows what you shot after shooting.If you want to use this as an advanced amateur/pro setup, you can, but know its limitations. I bought this in March and have been shooting all sports with it. I'm using a Canon L USM lens, and have gotten some terrific shots. But I've also missed some that have led me to decide to sell this camera and pick up a 20D. The problem I get into is focusing speed and zones. The 2.5 fps with only a 4 frame burst isn't as big a problem as it sounds. I can still get good action in the burst mode, but admittedly 5 fps with 22 or 25 (20D) bursts is much better. If you want to use this to shoot something like concerts or indoor events, you won't have the same focusing issues. You will have to deal with any flash limitations, but for that information, you will have to read another review. I'm not a camera flash guy under any definition.The only real problem I've had with this camera is that my shots are consistently underexposed by about .5-.7 of a stop. I shoot exclusively RAW mode (never shot JPG on this one other than first dozen or so shots) and it has been correctable when I convert the images. This is more of a minor irritation, and may not be noticable in JPEG shots. I've seen others using this camera complain of it as well.This camera is as good of a consumer camera as you will find. If a pro, or semi-pro, can make something function for his or her needs, you know the consumer can get everything they need out of this.

It is very sharp, very light and compact and gives me a total shooting range (combined with the Canon included lens) of 18-200, taking me to over 300 in the  35mm format equivalent.(2) The Pelican 1400 Case: also at B&H; for about $61....The case protects the equipment far better than any case at anywhere near the price....It nicely holds the camera body with either the kit lens or the Sigma 55-200 attached...In addition it perfectly holds the lens that you are not using at the time, as well as the Canon external flash..I have the 420EX..This is about it...not a lot of wasted space..the case is now full and easy to toss in the compartment above my seat on the plane.. ..knowing my equipment is fully protected....The case also is easy to operate from when in my car.", "Date": "January 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "Prosumer or P&S - it does it..", "Author": "Shiprekd", "ReviewID": "RYHU79VLPO2FH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading the couple poor/inexperienced reviews of the camera, I had to write. The Dreb is an EXCELLENT camera for both indoors and outdoor photography from the beginner all the way to even the pro ranks. The Dreb has one of the cleanest images in the high ISO ranges (extremely low noise) of all the cameras. ANY digital image should be post processed, and canon intentionally uses softer raw image processing (which you can change the parameters and even a free third party program called FEC set) than the rest.  Their software does a nice job of post processing for being a bundled software. Almost ALL of the other manufacturers oversharpen the images and Canon gives you room to adjust the images. Basically, the Dreb is a Canon 10D  except for a lack of a few advanced features and has a tough composite body compared to the 10D's magnesium body (I have both the Dreb and the 10D - so take it from someone who knows first hand). The Dreb does do much better with a 420EX shoemount Flash ($180)and with a Sto-Fen Omni-bounce ($20)on it. You get photos rivaling the pros. Again, I know, I take portraits to high speed motorsports with it.  The kit lens 18-55s is an excellent lens and if you complement it with a sigma 70-300 DL super macro ($150+/-) lens, you've got a decent priced setup. I also have the both IS USM lenses and can tell you the cheaper SIGMA focuses faster than the 70-300 IS USM lens (compared them following a RC controlled car!) and even full length focal in macro is better than the $600 IS lens; which by the way, doesn't have macro feature.  Overall the camera is worth more than what you pay. If you get a defective camera, then exchange it, don't bash one of the best cameras/price out there.. Don't shy away from this camera, as you grow/learn, it'll do whatever you point it at.... want examples? go to Pbase or any other photo review site and you'll see that the Dreb is more than respectable.", "Date": "March 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "WOW!", "Author": "Evelyn Rosado \"Evelyn\"", "ReviewID": "RPI9C380KF9W6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read every available review before purchasing this camera.

My most recent was the C-50. I did own a Rebel GII, which took great pictures using film.  This Digital Rebel goes beyond that.  I was amazed at the colors & the sharpness of the pictures.  I'm not the best photographer in the world, but this camera makes me feel like one.  I haven't taken a bad shot yet. The camera does have some weight to it, but it works to your advantage because there is less shaking when taking pictures.  Also, you HAVE to look through the viewfinder to compose your shot-not the LCD screen.  You can take 4 consecutive pictures w/o any delay, love that for action shots.

Now 6.3 and I can finally stop buying digital cameras.  With the combination of this camera and my Epson Stylus Photo 960 printer, I'll never have to go the local \"photomat\" any more.  That's not to say my most recent digital camera (Canon S50) didn't take great pictures, but they still needed a bit of a touch up and lightening to make them look OK for a final print.  This camera changes all of that.  I've taken a number of pictures with this camera and with the PIM plug-in in my Adobe Photoshop Elements software, I just print them out without the need to touch them up at all.  I'm a beginner when it comes to photography and I can't give you all of the technical mumbo-jumbo about all the features of the camera, all I can say is that it takes fantastic pictures!  However, there were a few things that kept me from giving it 5 stars which I think I need to share, especially if you're a beginner (like me), or even a novice...** It's a rather large camera.  If it's going to be a camera that you're going to take to a party or even a sporting event, it will be a bit bulky to carry around.** Unlike most other digital cameras today, the screen on back is only for reviewing the pictures.  You can't use it as a viewfinder to take a picture.  You have to look through the eyepiece.** The built in flash is pretty much of a waste.  It's not strong enough get a good picture in a dimly lit room, and it blows out your subject in a close up of a small item.  You really need to get a speedlite for this camera.** There is a bit of a learning curve.  Not all pictures come out top notch with the \"Auto\" setting.  I'm still getting some pictures that are sharp in the front, and blurry in the rear.  It's been tricky to figure out how to position the 7 auto-focus \"points\" that are in the viewfinder.  I'm sure it's just something I need to learn but by no means is this just a \"point and shoot\" camera.** This sub-$1000 dollar camera can easily turn into a \"thousands of dollars\" camera.  There are a seemingly endless amount of lenses that are available for different things such as macro lenses for extreme close-ups (there is no macro mode on the camera, you need to buy a \"macro lens\" for macro shots), or wide angle and telescopic lenses.  Some of these lenses cost more than the camera itself.  A good quality speedlite will be another couple hundred bucks, at least.  Then you'll need a good case to carry it in, some extra memory cards, and an extra battery or two.  Of course, all of these things are optional, but to get the most out of the camera, you will need to spend some additional money.  All of that aside, I'm still keeping my Canon S50 for it's small size, point and shoot features, and excellent picture quality.  But for the times that I want unsurpassed fantastic picture quality, I'll never need to use another film camera again.  I don't care if they come out with a 50 megapixel camera tomorrow, there is simply NO WAY the naked eye is going to see better picture quality than what this camera puts out.

I'd made a decision to step up to this level of camera earlier this summer.  After researching what was available, I was 99% sold on the Canon EOS 10-D.  While searching for the best deal on a 10-D, I found out that Canon would be releasing the Digital Rebel in a little over a month.  I read all the technical specs and the estimated price and was sold.  This camera has the same sensor and most of the features of the 10-D but is over $500 cheaper.  Yes, the body is made of \"plastic\" and not the spiffy Magnesium Alloy body the 10-D has.  I for one am thankful for the lighter weight plastic body.  If you are like me and this is your first Digital SLR camera, it will take some time getting used to the weight of these cameras.  The Digital Rebel, while not as rugged as the 10-D, is built very sturdy.  Now, onto my favorite part... the pictures.  I could not believe the quality of the pictures I was taking.  The color and textures that I was able to capture blew me away.  And the ability to shoot fully auto all the way to fully manual and several \"creative zones\" in between made exploring this camera's abilities fun and easy.

It takes very sharp pictures and I don't feel like I am limited by the feature set in anyway except for lack of being able to shoot RAW in some of the user modes.  The lens that it comes with is a good starter lens and takes good pictures but once you get addicted you might end up purchasing a Canon L and or Prime like I did. :)  This camera is great for learning photography with because you get to see your results very quickly!  This camera just takes great pictures and gives you all the control you need to get creative with exposure, focus, etc.  The plastic body is relatively durable although I wouldn't want to drop it but then would you want to drop a metal body camera either?!  Do not fear, even with a plastic body it has that solid SLR feel.  All my hard copy prints from the online digital photo lab look very sharp.  I even had a poster print done and it came out great.  Many people claimed that 6 Megapixal camera is not enough to make a good poster print.  After seeing the results I say hogwash.  The poster print I got back from the online photolab(Ofoto in this case) was a better quality print than any poster print I have seen at the mall poster store.  8x10 prints are simply stunning.  Take the time to go through the manual and learn all the features of the camera.  I can not really comment on the software that comes with the camera because I never mess software that they bundle with cameras.  I use a good card reader, Windows XP for my OS, Irfanview (which is free) for viewing and mild editing, and Photoshop(not so free) for any major editing.  I found the Sandisk Ultra II Compact Flash cards work very well and are worth the extra dough for the faster performance.

Thus you can decide if you need to retake your picture.If you're an amateur artist, that is you are looking to get just the right shot of the water dripping off an icicle, then the screen helps you the same way, rather than waiting till you get images back from the lab, or develop them your self you can download them to your computer or laptop and check them out right away, and if you're not the purist, you can even edit them =)-Rebel Specific Points-I used a Rebel EOS before getting my hands on a digital Rebel EOS, and I'll tell you besides not needing to load film, the experience taking pictures is exactly the same.  The only differences are bonus' (i.e. being able to see your image right away)THE PIXLES are so high that you will have no problems getting large prints, and being digital images, you can sign up with a company like Ofoto.com and get your prints made into calendars, or even photo books (which I'm going to make full use of this Christmas)MEMORY is entirely in your hands, unlike some cameras which contain their memory on board, this loads memory sticks in the side.  I have a \u00bd gig stick, and took 80 photos on there once, though I also took 50 photos on there once maxing it out.  But if you have another stick... you can always pop that one in there and keep on shooting, and these sticks are much easier to carry around than real film. -side note about memory sticks... they are very sturdy... a group at MIT I believe wanted to see how tough these things really were, tried things from the soft, like dropping one on the floor, to the rather morbid, like nailing one to a tree.... All but a few survived (including the one nailed to a tree.... No joke... they could hardly kill these things)  So don't feel like you need to baby your memory sticks, they are pretty tough...  (though I'm unsure how memory sticks react to metal detectors incase you're a photographer who travels a lot)IT IS QUITE FAST!  As I said before the experience taking a photo with this camera was the same as with my film loaded EOS.  Unlike many digital cameras I've been photographed with where the user pushes a button and a good 3 seconds later it flashes and takes a picture, the Rebel snaps to attention and BAM! Takes your picture directly on command no delays.CONTOLS, again just like the old EOS, and like poker, can be picked up by the complete novice but can take a lifetime to master.  The automatic setting allows the user to simply point and shot, the camera will take the best most clear image possible.  Even some of the extra settings could be fun for the novice.  Yet the manual settings allow for the professional to experiment to the fullest extent of their talent.COMPATIBILITY, it's fully compatible with rebel lenses, flashes and equipment of the Rebel EOS era.  Just like all other Canon gear.DRAWBACK POINTS:I feel the viewfinder could be extended back a bit, you kind of press your face against the screen to take a picture which was fine when it was just the film door, but now if it's hot or your face is otherwise dirty you're always wiping the screen off... not a huge deal but it's something I can put up as a negative...Then there is the expense, it is rather expensive.It is also fairly big, it's a good 10-15% bigger and heavier than my film loaded EOS.It's computer related.... Which means it's likely it will be outclassed in maybe 3 years... maybe video capability, sound capturing, size reduction.... Who knows what will come next. CONCLUSION:  It's a great camera for any type of user, and it produces quality images in a format you can do a lot more than just get prints with. It's compatible with EOS compatible equipment.  It's fast, accurate, and just an all around excellent camera.  The only issue is it's price, I do admit that at 1k this camera is a bit expensive for what is just an amazing camera after all... Little side story, I took my Digital Rebel out with me for an early morning canoe ride trying to catch the sunrise... I came in with 8 keepers and a new background for my laptop.

No more delay in taking your picture, when you push the shutter release, the picture is taken.  But if you want full control of your exposure, f/stops, and shutter speeds, you've got that too.

By the way, use the timer to get pics so you don't wiggle the camera when you push the button or buy the corded remote which works great as a timed \"bulb\" timer.As for the flash, well its not the best but for everyday snapshots it works fine. I suggest the 420EX by canon for a great flash.Plastic body isn't as good as the more expensive cameras but it is very hard plastic and feels extremely solid.The camera's lens that comes with it is good, not great but very capable for the extra cost of the camera.One of the drawbacks is the mirror instead of a prism in the more expensive cameras and also the mirror 'slap' seems louder and may cause more vibration, which could lead to less sharp pics.

The right user, however, can get similar results.That said, unless you are a professional photographer, I cannot imagine how the Digital Rebel could be inadequate for any amateur or semi-pro shooter.

Use manual focus and grow up.Quality is great from ISO 100-400, although 800 can be somewhat ugly at times, and 1600 is basically unusable, especially if you're not shooting at f/2.8 or bigger.My main complaints: slow start-up time compared to the newer models (XT, 20D, etc) ... camera seems to be out of breath after continuous shooting; take 8 shots quickly and you may notice the camera needs to process info before it can shoot again. 2.5 frames/second is not very fast if you're shooting any sports.Overall, this camera has been incredibly reliable for me; it's gotten me front page shots on newspapers, magazine covers, calendars and websites. I used it so much that I blew out the shutter in 10 months; Canon fixed it at no charge and it works fine since. One minor problem: very rarely, it won't turn on unless I remove the battery and re-insert it.I've found the battery life to be fantastic. I can use it all day, even with flash, and still have some life at the end of the day. A backup battery in your bag should give you more than enough insurance for a day.I've printed at 11x17 with excellent results.With some practice, it's very easy to navigate.

This is a high quality camera at a very reasonable price. A few points to note from my experience.LensesI had a film EOS so I thought I did not need the kit lense and did not buy it. Lenses for film cameras do work with the digital kiss but there are two problems. Due to the size difference between the digital sensor and a 35mm film, the stated focal length of the film lens becomes about 1.4 longer when used with the digital camera. I.e. a 28 mm film lens becomes a 40mm lens when used on the digital Kiss. This means that I lack a wide angle lens for use with the digital. Secondly, while humans can accomodate for the fact that what it says on the lens is not the correct focal length, when using with a canon flash (I have a 380EX) the lens communicates its focal length to the flash gun based on the numbers on the lens not on the adjusted focal length. This means that the flash gun inturn adjusts its flash dispersion width to meet the incorrect focal length and so the exposures is out. One can adjust the exposure manually but the size of the adjustment does not seem to be consistent over the range for my \"28\" to \"70\" Canon zoom.

However, I've noticed that the other reviewers seem to miss what for me is the most exciting feature of this camera -- the ability to use high quality Canon EF lenses. Put an inexpensive Canon EF 50 mm f/1.8 lens on the Digital Rebel and you will be astonished at the quality of your photos. (This lens can be had for about $70. new.) For example, you'll obtain near professional quality portraits with gorgeous backround blur using a wide aperture. If you are truly interested in photography as a hobby, there is no other way to go -- you must have a camera that can accept interchangable lenses. Primes (fixed focal length) lenses are the least expensive and of superb optical quality. Comparable quality telephoto lenses are far more expensive and they won't be as fast (have as wide an aperture) or as light weight and compact. Photography is completely different with a camera like the Rebel. Once you try it, there is no turning back. It will become apparent that the decision on which camera back to purchase is least important decision you make. Choosing the right lens is the really critical choice. Of course, along with the pleasure comes the pain: you'll soon find yourself lusting after Canon L (professional quality) glass that will set you back thousands at a pop.

Everyone asked if it was digital and I said, \"no, digital isn't up to my standards yet.\" Well, now it is! When I saw the Rebel Digital 6.3 megapixel I just *knew* the time had come to go digital. I am so happy with it! I bought it while on vacation this past week so I got to use it for vacation pictures. I bought a 128 MB memory card to go with it (it doesn't come with any memory card at all) and at the \"Large/Fine\" setting was able to take about 48 pictures before running out of room. At smaller settings I'd have gotten many more pictures out of the 128. But the camera comes with a cable and software to connect seamlessly with your computer, so since I brought my laptop along I was able to download my pictures and re-use the card. By trip's end I did buy a 512 MB card, but only in preparation for my trip to London next month, because I don't want to have to lug my laptop on my walks around the city. I also experimented with switching the lens from my Rebel Film camera to my new Rebel Digital. The digital Rebel comes with an 18-55mm, while the film Rebel comes with a 28-90mm lens.The lens from the film Rebel fit just fine on the digital Rebel, but I was unable to switch the other way and put the 18-55 on my film Rebel. Both lenses worked great on the digital. The battery that the Rebel Digital uses is the same battery I use on my Canon ZR45 MC mini Digital Video Camcorder. I would say it lasted 3-4 days of moderate use on my Rebel, which is much better than the 3 hours I get from it on the camcorder. Many of the controls on the digital Rebel are the same as on the film Rebel, which is to say, EASY and intuitive. What I like best about the Rebel is that it grows with you: you can use the auto controls to basically \"point and shoot\", or you can use the manual controls when you know what you're doing. The auto controls cover most circumstances you'll ever need: action, night, closeup, landscape, portrait, no flash, or fully automatic. The manual side gives you auto depth of field, aperture control, shutter speed control, exposure control, or fully manual. I've been extremely happy with the auto controls. Some day I'll graduate over to the manual side and try to dredge up from my memory what I learned 20 years ago in school. What I love about digital is that you can instantly critique your photos and delete the ones that don't turn out as well as you'd thought. But what sold me on going digital at this point is that with the 6.3MP the quality is such that I can enlarge my photos to poster size without losing quality. You just don't have that in a 35 mm camera except under the most optimum conditions. I wanted the flexibility to be able to take pictures under all lighting conditions and be able to use the ones that turn out great in any way I want. I love taking night shots and these cameras handle them BEAUTIFULLY. I'm expecting to be able to make posters and frame and sell them.I haven't yet printed out my pictures but they look absolutely fantastic on screen. I'm excited again about my photographic skills.

Battery life on this camera is very good.  The \"shutter lag\" (between when you depress the button and when the camera actually takes a photo) is fairly well non-existent, and the only real lag I have is when I am shooting multiple photos in RAW format.  As most photographers know, the lens is almost more important than the body, and outside of Leica lenses, I don't think anything really competes with Canon's line.  The 18-55 lens that comes with this camera is sufficient for casual work...I used it at the beach, and on hikes with my dog, when I don't want to lug around my bigger, more expensive, higher-quality lenses.  But for $75 or so, you can have a 50mm 1.8 EOS lens, which will supplement the 18-55 nicely, particularly for night photography.My one complaint about this camera is its ability to meter light adequately in dark settings.  When I shoot RAW this isn't such a big problem, because I can fix it in Photoshop, but most everything I shoot inside, unless I manually mess with the white balance every time, has an orange tint that is interesting for the first 200 shots, and then is annoying after.  I think the more advanced EOS models that have come out since 2004 or so fix this color problem, and also help a bit with the lag between the RAW shots...but for the money, this camera is excellent, and far, far superior to, for example, Olympus' digital exquivalent (for a similar price).  The difference, as far as I'm concerned, is in the absolute advantage Canon has in lens quality.  You can use a high-end consumer body like this one, use a professional piece of Canon glass (lens) and take excellent photos.

It just has more controls for the digital-specific aspects of photography.  If you are comfortable using a film SLR, you will know how to use this camera right away.Also, unlike cheaper digital cameras, you have virtually no shutter lag or waiting between shots.

I believe it pops up higher than my old film rebel, and higher than most cameras, so this is a big plus.There is only one thing I can fault this camera on.

What better way is there to judge for yourself.. as to what this camera can do?Even though this camera is a bit pricy for the \"normal\" person, I believe it's well worth it.. especially if you want to take better pictures.  The battery life is excellent, and can last you an entire day shooting.  Be sure to pick yourself up a high capacity CF card though.. because with 6.5 MP, this camera takes some large pictures.  But the pictures are rich with color and life! You get the one lens, with this particular 'kit', but you can pick up a variety of lenses that can go with it... so you can shoot closeup shots.. to telephoto.  You're not stuck using the EF lenses, strictly from Canon, you can use any lense, from any manufacturer, as long as they will fit the Canon EOS body.  When in doubt, be sure to ask from wherever you're buying the lense from!  If you buy online, call and ask!  (only deal with reputable online retailers or make sure you do your research first).. and if you're buying locally.. you can always bring your camera into the store with you to make sure.  Because of this versitility in who's lenses you can use, you don't have to spend high $$$$ on a lense.  It's ability to take either type I or type II CF card is very good, and because it's not limited to the size of the card, you can even go with higher capacity things, such as a microdrive, if you want to.  (that saves some $ there .. as microdrives are a bit less expensive than CF cards).The weight of the camera, itself, is very comfortable.  It's not too heavy and Canon provides a good strap for around your neck. Of course, you start adding on telephoto lenses, and the weight is going to increase.. but it's doable.. besides.. that's what tripods are for ;)  It fits well into my hand and the buttons are in an easy reach position.  The only thing really \"lacking\" on this camera.. is .. well.. if anything I would have a better instruction booklet.  Not that theirs is bad.. but for the average consumer, who wants to learn photography ...  what is aperature, etc....... the instruction booklet is a bit lacking.

J McCartin", "ReviewID": "R1WRD11DJRKKZR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been \"getting along\" with a canon powershot G2 and a HP photosmart 850 digital cameras for several years. By and large those are both good digitals but they have the common problem of being \"slooooowwwww\" between shots, just not really fit for fast action. The Rebel can take 2.5 frames per second in full quality mode and 4 frames per second if you drop the quality down one notch (to about 4 megapixels instead of the full 6+).I've been waiting for a digital SLR to come into the affordable range and Canon has finally done that with the Rebel. For about the same price as something like a G6, the Rebel offers quick performance and interchangeable lenses. The Rebel can use any genuine canon EF lens made in the last several years. (Non-canon EF compatible lenses are a gamble on newer bodies due to command set differences in the firmware of the camera and the lenses--no third party has licensed the Canon EF mount, they're all reverse-engineered.) (Yes it shares the same lens mount as the film version of the Rebel.) The digital Rebel can also use the newer Canon EFS lenses (I don't really understand the difference but they're somehow superior to the older EF lenses). The Rebel includes both a built-in flash and a hotshoe that accepts Canon EX speedlights or compatibles. I've shot about 250 pictures with my Rebel, it's fast (really fast compared to my other digitals)and so far competent although I have to comment that my 380EX flash doesn't seem to be exposing far shots properly in shutter priority mode--this may be one of those incompatibility things because it's an older flash unit (but it works perfectly on my G2). The Rebel offers a fair amount of exposure control and a full manual mode as well as manual focusing if you so desire. I like the viewfinder a lot, it's sharp enough for correct manual focusing--even in somewhat low light. I also like the way the AF points are mapped out and will briefly illuminate so you know where the camera is focusing (you can choose AF points with a button available under your right thumb). Also inside the viewfinder you get shutter and aperature info at the bottom.There are several pre-programmed modes for portrait, landscape, depth of field mode, and sports mode. I haven't really had much chance to try these out yet. The only slight disappointment is that the Rebel doesn't have separate exposure controls for the flash (my G2 has this). I think this just might not be available on the Rebel as the firmware seems to have accounted for this setting (i.e. it might be available on the more expensive EOS bodies). Some common controls are set with buttons while others are on menus.  There is a dual readout on the back. A black and white screen shows things like shooting mode, pictures remaining on the card, flash mode etc.  While the generously sized LCD directly below it is used for accessing camera setup menus and playing back pictures.  The Rebel does have a after-shot display mode but it's not really useful because you have your face up to the camera to use the optical viewfinder--just turn it off to save battery power.  Interestingly, unlike my G2, the camera is not useless while your last shot is being displayed, it can do two things at once and pressing the shutter button cancels the aftershot image display.The Rebel is not like point and shoot digitals in that it lacks a few functions that you may have become attached to: there is no panorama (stitch mode) function, no preview (because of the SLR like shutter system on the Rebel a preview mode is impossible), and no digital zoom (since you can't have a preview mode digital zoom just won't work because there is no electronic viewfinder either). The Rebel line uses a CMOS digital sensor as opposed to the CCD sensor used in most cameras.  The Canon CMOS sensors are supposedly much superior to the CCD even at higher ISO (lower light) settings and there have been reports of acceptable prints even at iso 1600.If you purchase a Rebel I would suggest that you also buy the 75-300mm EF to give yourself a good selection of focal lengths for a variety of shooting needs.  Until January 2005, Canon is running a fairly good rebate. If you buy a Rebel body (no extra rebate if you get this kit) and a second EF lens the rebate will be over $200.00.  I bought this kit and the 75-300MM EF and pre- registered the rebate online (using the UPC barcodes), my rebate will be $220.00 (even though the coupon seems to say $230.00 but it may be a slightly different model lens).Overall, so far I like this camera.

Many reviewers have said all the stuff they like about it and I whole-heartedly agree with most of them. One thing I'd like to add is to note Canon's online digital learning center (photoworkshop) is a great resource for amateur photgraphers like me who are new to the digital world. There are over 20 great lessons to go through. You can access the site from Canon's main EOS webpage. I have had a 35mm Canon Rebel SLR for several years now and have been very happy with it. I bought this camera primarily because I can use the EF lenses I purchased over the years for my 35mm Rebel with this camera as well. And I'm glad I did. This camera works well with my other lenses. The only thing that's kinda a bummer is there is a 1.6 multiplying factor on the lens's focal length, so my 35-80 functions like a 56-128 on the Digial Rebel. It's nice to have the extra zoom, but it can be difficult to get all the subjects into a shot that is composed a couple feet away. The standard lens that comes with this camera was designed to compensate for this, but given our cash flow I'm perfectly content without it...maybe someday we'll get a wide-angle lens. In the meanwhile I'm excited about the fact that my old telephoto lense now functions with a maximum focal length of 480!!My only real complaint is that the only RAW support that comes with this camera is Canon's File Viewer Utility. The Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0 cannot work with RAW files taken with this camera. Instead you would need the full Photoshop CS version to have that functionality and in order to buy Photoshop CS with this camera you would have to multiply your final cost by about a factor of 1.6. That's a bit pricey. To further frustrate me, Adobe's Photoshop Album, which is a great little program, also doesn't recognize the Digital Rebel's RAW files. So either I have to take pictures in JPG mode or I have to individually convert all my RAW photos using Canon's utility, which is powerful, but clunky and slow.But, if that's the only thing I really have to complain about, I must have a great camera...which I do.

Wang", "ReviewID": "RNP6MJWUWL511", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought and used this camera for about three weeks (without the kit lens since I have several other Canon lenes already, which are better than the kit lens in terms of image quality). Canon recently throws a lot of rebates on this model (up to $300 rebate if you buy two other Canon lenses). This is an incredible deal. Is this the best entry level DSLR? My answer is \"probably yes, but with some reservation on its features\". Marketed as an entry level DSLR, it is reasonable to expect some tradeoff due to cost cutting. But some of Canon's design decisions are puzzling at best, which compromises its quality and functionality, without reducing overall cost (in other words, it could be done better without incurring additional cost). Here is my exprience.On the up side:The camera feels solid with the right weight. Originally I though it may feel flimsy and overly light since it is made of plastic (the feeling you get of Canon Rebel film camera), but as soon as I took that out of the package, I started to like its weight (not too heavy as you feel for metal-bodied SLR, not too light). Of course, it is still heavier (with lens attached) than consumer grade digital cameras.The camera's operation is much like other Canon SLRs. It has same lens mount (EF mount) as all other modern Canon SLRs which also means you can use all your Canon EF lens (or other third party lenses which conform to EF standard, I use a Tamron lens on this camera without problem). It can also use new EF-S mount lens which is what the kit lens uses. But since EF-S lens is relatively new and can be only used on this camera (and D20 which newly comes out), be aware of Canon's commitment to this lens format in the long term and prepare to throw away EF-S lenses after several years. The controls on the back side of the camera is different than most Canon's consumer grade digital cameras and film SLRs. So if you come from these worlds, there is something to learn, but not too much though.Image quality is superb. Not only it has 6Mpixel resolution, but the overall noise level of image is very low. At ISO 100, image is silk smooth. At ISO 800, noise is visible but pretty controlled. At ISO 1600, noise is much bigger, but still usable, especially you use some noise reduction tools to post processing such image. It surely beats ALL consumer and prosumer level digital cameras on the noise front. And the reason is it uses large CMOS sensor, much bigger than smaller CCD sensor used in consumer digital cameras. So if you are looking at low light performance, you have to use a DSLR like Canon digital rebel. Of course, the image quality of a DSLR also depends on what lens you use. Most of Canon's lenses should deliver better results than most consumer digital cameras.The builtin flash pops up high, which is good. Unlike the flash on film rebel, which pops up low and its light may be obstructed by some large lenses, this flash should work well for most lenses. However, see my comments below, it does have some shortcomings.Focusing is adequate as you can expect from a SLR. The seven point auto focus sometimes does the wrong focusing, and you can select focus point to overcome this. It is not superb, but not bad either.Now comes the down side:Compact flash write speed is quite slow. Even use a high speed CF card (I use Lexar 80X), it still appears slow and not utilizes the full potential of these fast CF cards. When you shoot 4 photos at once, you have to wait the camera buffer to be emptied to CF to continue. This takes somewhere from 10 seconds to 20 seconds depending on your CF card.No LCD display of image you are trying to shoot. Almost all consumer digital cameras allow you view objects in the LCD screen. You have to look closely though the small viewfinder window to track objects. This is a very convenient feature to have so I am wondering why Canon does not do this if it is targeting non-professional photographers.There is no flash compensation. Again you can find this feature on many Canon's consumer level digital cameras. Another disappointment.Metering is odd. You have to use the standard evaluative mode most of the times without any other choices. I'd like to see different metering modes available under all shooting modes. Occasionally, I feel some images are underexposed.Downloading images to your computer is absolutely painfully slow. It uses a USB 1.1 interface - why not USB 2.0 or firewire? The download speed feels slower than the old Canon G2 I have. If you shoot a full 2GB of images, expect several hours of downloading.Why a seperate battery charger? Old Canon G2 has builtin battery charger so you don't need to pull out the bettary to charge. Moving battery in and out every time it runs out is a hassel.So overall, I think it is a great camera, but if Canon can do more to fix/enhance these issues, that would make this camera an absolute hit.

Fantastic pictures & features. I worked with SLR's for many years. Figured it was time to \"move up\" to the digital SLR and glad I did. This camera has plenty of features available, or you can just set it for \"auto\" and that works fine, too. Though an optional flash is not needed for most photography I wanted one for far shots and such. Canon makes several models dedicated to this camera, but I find them weak (220EX) or costly.  Shop carefully in trying to find a compatible flash. It needs to be \"dedicated\" to the digital Rebels. One that will work with AF (auto focus) or the SLR (film) Rebel may not work right.  I also received conflicting information from Ritz Camera, both on-line and in the stores. Bottom line, if you need a flash, shop carefully and ask all the right questions.

I have two other digitals that are great cameras but are so slowwwwwwww you just can't shoot action with them very effectively.  This camera, for the price point, is a good deal. For those used to film SLRs you won't feel like a fish out of water and if you've already got canon EF lenses they should all work perfectly with this camera body (it can also take the newer EFS lenses).  Because of the SLR like shutter system and TTL focusing this camera lacks some of the functions available on traditional point and shoot digitals--there is no preview mode, no movie mode, no digital zoom and no panorama/stitch mode; keep your old point and shoot (or buy one) for those functions.  <br /><br />This camera is fast! The responsiveness is nearly up to a film camera (I should know I've shot with film cameras for years).  This camera offers 2.5 fps (in full quality mode) or 4 fps (in lower quality mode) continuous shooting--no point and shoot that I know of can match that--this is truly a low end professional digital slr body. The 17-55mm lens that comes with it is great for nearby shots such as at parties or when your subject is no more than 20 feet away.  <br /><br />I suggest two other lenses for this camera that you won't want to be without.  The Canon 28-135 IS USM III zoom and the 75-300 USM zoom (also available with IS if you want to spend the extra money).  IS is a wonderful invention and gives you clear handheld shots at some amazingly slow shutter speeds (IS is a gyroscopic system in the lens that accounts for camera shake during the shot--really amazing what it can do).  The 28-135 lense is widely considered the best \"walk around\" lense for just about anything. The IS system does suck batteries so I'd suggest you get a couple of extra batteries right away (ebay has the best price for them).  If you can't afford a 20D this is the next best thing.  The Rebel is really a striped down 10D, so if you're waffling between this and the 10D--I've heard the differences aren't really worth the extra money.  The other big purchase you want with this camera is a 550EX or 580EX speedlight.  The Rebel lacks IR focus assist but if you have one of these speedlights the camera can use the IR assist on the flash unit!!!!!  <br /><br />I use my rebel to shoot Karate demos, lots of fast action, usually indoors.  I think the 20D would be a better choice for this (because of the bigger buffers while writing to the CF card) but the Rebel can hold its own fairly well if you think out your shots a bit more.  I'm really happy with this camera and I'd recommend it to anyone that wants to move up to a digital slr but doesn't want to spend ten grand doing it.  The camera has a few foibles and professionals might complain that some of the pre programmed modes are far too limited--but that's because it's cheap--the 20D will be more satifying if you've got the money for it.  Canon's running a pretty fantastic rebate until mid January, if you buy a Rebel and two lenses you get about $300 back just on the camera and around 50 bucks for each lens.  Yep I spent about $1600.00 on the camera and two lenses but that's quite a deal for all I got.<br /><br />I recommend this if you don't have the money for a 20D, if you do, or are close to having it, wait and get the 20D.", "Date": "December 3, 2004"}, {"Title": "Consider 10d body, buy quality cf cards", "Author": "Glenn \"Glenn\"", "ReviewID": "R3AGWXXJ2702XY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally upgraded from the trusty EOS1000.

We shot about 10,000 pictures with a Nikon CoolPix 950 in the couple of years before getting the Digital Rebel.This camera does several things for you.The noise is extremely low. If you have sufficient light to shoot ISO-100 then the results are marvelous.  Even at ISO-400 the results are better than that of our previous camera.Because the noise is so low in dim light you can push the ISO too 400 or 800 and still take really good pictures. Even at ISO-1600 the results are very acceptable. My biggest gripe with the Nikon was the low sensitivity. I would line up a good shot but the camera wanted to set the shutter to something like 1/2 second making it impossible to get a good picture without a tripod. The camera operates very quickly. The total time for sensing light, auto-focus and shutter operation is a fraction of a second. Combined with the low noise of the sensor this means you can take pictures that would have been missed otherwise.Battery life is very good. You can take something like 400 pictures (without flash) on one charge. You'll run out of storage before running out of battery life.The auto white balance is sometimes not perfect in various indoor lighting situations. However, the manual white balance works beautifully. Just shoot a pure white piece of paper as a reference then all subsequent pictures come out perfect.My one complaint is that the interface is only USB. It should have been Firewire.

I bought this camera about 5 months ago and I am in love with. I was not new to photography or to SLR's, but new to the world of digital SLR. I had previously used an ancient Minolta x-570, a \"pro-sumer\" 35mm film slr with a Vivitar 35-105 standard zoom lens. First and foremost this camera takes excellent pictures, very high quality and no distortion that I have seen. This camera is particularly good as a beginner's dSLR because there are so many options to use and learn. But until you are ready to take advantage of all the featues, you can use this just like a point and shoot. Battery life has been excellent so far: thought I would suggest getting an extra to have as  a backup for long days of taking photos.  I have also been quite happy with the kit lens, which I wasn't sure I would like since it is not as versatile as the lens I had been using on my Minolta. But the kit lens has proved to be a great learning tool: I have been able to take some great shots, while also learning what kinds of other, better lenses I would like to add to my setup.**The only issue I have had was a problem with a Sandisk 2gb CF card. After about 300 shots, the camera froze and stopped responding to that card. I was able to salvage most of the photos after the fact, but don't risk it.

And the manual control of the camera gives you a lot of artistic freedom I have yet to see in other cameras. Even though all my friends are dissapointed that one cannot look at the LCD there's assurance in the viewfinder because what you see is really what you get. Oh, and that wide angle lens... wow! You have no clue what a difference that makes in a small room! This camera is a great value! The only problem I had is that after 18,000 shots in 90 days the auto-focus went out, something that could be easily repaired by Canon but since the store I bought it from has a 90-day return policy I opted to return the camera and buy a Canon 10D. Some small annoyances I wish Canon will fix since Nikon is hot on their tail- The slap of the mirror is in excess. Really. Trying to take pictures in a quiet room can be very unnerving.- The Compact-Flash Read/Write borders on pitiful sometimes. Yeah I know the files are large but it really takes just too long.- You learn easily that the 4 image buffer isn't enough if you photograph action.- Uh, why on earth are the Aperature and LCD Light buttons about an inch away from my thumb? They need to be moved closer.- When ISO or WB are adjusted it would be nice to have that information in the viewfinder- it's annoying having to hold the camera down to adjust these two paramaters (no real excuse about the ISO!)I think that's about it. If you have NO investment in lenses I may suggest a Nikon D70 if you can afford it, should you think you will become a serious photographer. If you have any Canon EF lenses the D-Rebel is a great choice, especially if you cannot afford a 10D or a new investment in Nikon and the D70. If you barely have the cash for a D-Rebel buy the D-Rebel.

The prospect of getting a 6.3MP digital SLR for a little more than double what I was prepared to spend on a camera was a no-brainer for me. I received my Digital Rebel w/ kit lens at the end of September, so I've been using it for almost 4 months. I'm no photographer; I'm still learning even the basics of photography.First of all, I recommend the kit lens. It's great for wide-angle interior shots, especially parties and get-togethers. I was wanting for something with zoom, so I picked up a 28-200mm zoom lens, but I consider the kit lens to be my \"interior\" lens and use it as such.Adjusting to shooting through only the viewfinder was more of an adjustment than I expected, having used a point-and-shoot digital for 3 years prior. I'm getting used to it more quickly than I expected, though. I expect that, eventually, I'll consider it unprofessional to shoot with an LCD. On the other hand, there are situations where shooting from the LCD would be advantageous and helpful.Recommendations: 1) learn to use exposure lock to get proper exposure, especially in scenes with light and dark. 2) Always shoot in RAW mode for special shots, such as family portraits. Nothing is worst than assembling the troops, shooting what seems to be a good pic, getting it on the computer, realizing that it'll need a lot of touching up and noticing that your JPEG image loses detail and quality with every touch-up.Most sub-$1000 cameras teach you simply how to snap photos. The Digital Rebel teaches you *photography*.

I have used it for several personal events, but I have not used it yet to do the main thing I bought it for, which is sports and action photos.I have read some great reviews about this camera, and overall I am very pleased with it.  But I do think that there are 2-3 items that I should address that annoy me about this camera, which I did not realize before buying.First, I came from a Canon EOS A2, which had most features that I ever needed.  About my only complaint on this camera was that the flash-synche wasn't quite fast enough for me.  But that was minimal.Now, with the Digital Rebel, I realize I am taking a step down in the EOS \"family line\" but I was hoping the Rebel would be upgraded as such with the features that it's predecessors lacked.  Some were, and some weren't.The first lacking feature is the inability to change metering modes.  The camera has preset metering modes in the different \"creative\" and \"preset\" settings.  I cannot change from center-weighted metering to full-frame metering in Tv (shutter priority) Av (aperature priority) or full program (P)  The camera presets the metering for each of these modes and does not give me the option to change.The same is true for Single Shot and AI Servo focussing.  I cannot tell the camera to focus on a moving subject, unless in the \"Sports\" mode, and then in this mode, I cannot set the shutter speed manually.  In Tv, the camera \"senses\" whether you are following a subjext or not, and focuses either single-shot or AI Servo, depending on the movement of the subject.  But I have noticed that it takes a small amount of time to detect the subject moving.  After this, the lightning-fast EOS focussing system kicks in and all is well.These may be minor features to most, but they are features I became accustomed to with the EOS A2, and that camera is several years old.  I was hoping this new and improved rebel would be more munipulative, but it is not.Overall I would still rate this camera at 4 stars.  The photo quality is outstanding and the ease of use is great.  The focusing still screams and I can use my former lenses.

At under $1000, the Digital Rebel allows the amateur photographer to use the fine Canon autofocus lenses on a 6.3 Megapixel camera that can take superb pictures that are indistinguishable from film.  As of Spring 2004 six megapixels is more or less the standard for the best digital SLR cameras.  The advantages of digital images are many.  First of all, the digital camera allows the user to check the images as they are being taken, and even delete the \"dogs\" on the fly, freeing up storage space for another try.  No more suspense, as was the case with film, about how, or whether, the pictures turned out. The CF cards that the camera uses will hold several hundred images depending on the type of file format that the user selects.  After a shooting session, the user can examine the shots in detail on a personal computer and determine which ones are worthy of printing.  Then we can either print out professional-quality photos on a PC printer (photo-quality printers are not at all expensive these days, although the ink is not cheap) or email the image files to any of several printing companies that will mail back prints in a day or two.  The convenience is incomparably better than film.The results are better than film as well.  Using any of several inexpensive computer programs, even a casual amateur can modify, crop, and make other changes to the digital images that surpass what could once only be done in a $20,000 chemical darkroom.  The \"digital darkroom\" has arrived!The Digital Rebel is positioned well below Canon's excellent flagship camera, the Canon 10D.  It lacks certain features of the 10D including certain metering options.  It is not built as sturdily as the all-metal 10D.  But build quality is not at all bad on the Digital Rebel, and I liked the ergonomics of the camera and the layout of the menus.  And the price is truly competitive, around $500 less than the 10D--a significant difference.For a 35mm photographer looking to make the jump to digital, the Rebel is definitely one to consider.  If one has an investment in Canon autofocus lenses, the Rebel may very well be the way to go.  Users who do not have an investment in lenses will also want to compare the Rebel to the Nikon D70.  The two cameras are priced roughly the same, and the feature set is somewhat different--the D70 provides for different metering options that may (or may not) make a difference to the buyer.Overall, the Digital Rebel is a hot seller for good reason--it can take stunning digital images, it uses the same lenses as Canon's more expensive 10D, and is priced for the serious amateur market rather than the semi-pro market.", "Date": "April 15, 2004"}, {"Title": "Canon EOS Digital Rebel is tres fantastique!", "Author": "Amanda Miles \"French lady\"", "ReviewID": "R3NNJ2TH9XFG69", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been drooling over this camera for months, and recently I was able to purchase it.  In the area that I live the camera hadn't come in, and I was going to have to special order it.  Luckily Best Buy saved the day and thus...this review.  I have a great Pentax ZX-60 SLR that I have been using for quite some time (I love this camera as well) and had had a cheapo digital camera, so I was a little skeptical at how the digital rebel would perform.  This camera has given me some awesome pictures in the few weeks that I have had it.  Prior to owning this camera, I was considering becoming a professional photographer, and now I am truly hoping to become that.  The only thing that bother's me about the camera, is that it didn't come with ANY internal memory.  But, I talked my husband into getting the 1 gigabite compact flash card, so I am set.  It would be disappointing to recieve and then have to go and buy a compactflash card just to see if the camera works. Another great feature of the camera is the rechargable ion battery.  My prior digital camera took 2 AA batteries and sucked the juice out of them as quick as I put them in.  I took 92 pictures the other day with the rebel, and the battery hasn't run down at all.  One thing that I would recommend a buyer do would be to buy the camera bag that Canon has made to fit the digital rebel.  It's sixty dollars, but it comes with a UV filter (which is great to protect the lens) and an extra rechargable battery!  I could take a gazillion pictures with both of these batteries!  Anyhow, I completely recommend this camera to anyone who has some knowledge of how to use a 35mm SLR camera.

My wife had a normal film Rebel SLR, so for sake of compatibility, I figured I'd stick with Canon again.One Digital Rebel and $2000 in lenses later, I'm happy to say that I'm very pleased. The quality over your average Point & Shoot cameras is significant. The Rebel opened a whole new door for me when it came to post-processing.

Yes, the Rebel does have a significant learning curve, especially if you move away from the Point and Shoot settings. I had to learn nomenclature and settings, but figured it out eventually. The manual was fairly helpful in this regard.If you are worried about moving from a PnS camera system to the Prosumer side, don't be. The Rebel does have those PnS settings.

Some things feel very fragile, like the lids to the CF and Camera compartments, but I have seen this in most of my camera equipment, and they seem to hold with care.- It's an underperformer (shutter speed/slap noise/write speed/customizability, etc.) compared to the EOS 10D, but what can you expect?

I take about 2-3 a second (1-2 a second using the flash), which is outstanding for a digital camera.I haven't experienced some of the problems I have read in other reviews, such as under exposed photos indoors; in fact I've experienced great indoor shots.

I must say I was elated when I saw the Digital Rebel had been released and for $1000 with a lens. I did quite a bit of comparing between the 10D and the Rebel and there just wasn't enough difference to warrant the extra $...for me. If you are a professional, I would go with the 10D for the added control, but for the rest of us, the Rebel can do everything the former does it just requires a little more work to get there. The image quality is outstanding. I also have an Olympus C-2020 point and shoot and I would say in the Full Auto mode, the Rebel is just as easy to use as the 2020.

H. Bayliss \"book queen\"", "ReviewID": "RQWAJ4N1GP8NC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had an Olympus digital camera for several years but it started to frustrate me.  The two HUGE advantages the Canon has is that 1 -- there is NO shutter delay that makes you miss the shot:  the shot is taken as soon as you press the button and 2 -- you can buy high quality lenses that make the camera even more amazing.  Let me say I'm not a pro photographer or anything, but I figured out how to use all the features of this camera within a day or so.  It's very intuitive and fun.  Don't be afraid to step up from your non SLR camera.  Besides, you can still \"point and shoot\" in automatic modes, but it's awesome to be able to control just the aperature or just the shutter speed.  The pictures this camera takes are incredible!!!  I have to admit I've gotten gadget fever.  I'll make some recommendations based on my two weeks with the camera.1 -- buy a 1GB or bigger compact flash card with fast download speed.  At big megastores they are very much discounted.  Also, don't forget to REFORMAT the card every time you put it back -- my old cards always got \"corrupted\" and the way to avoid that is to reformat every time (just takes 2 seconds -- use the \"format card\" option on the camera menu).2 -- buy an external flash.  You'll notice that the internal flash tends to overexpose yoru subjects -- I bought the Canon 420 (or something like that) and it's amazing. My pics are TWICE as good3 -- I'd recommend NOT buying the kit lens and putting that money towards the exact Canon EF lens you'll need.  I bought one zoom and one prime lens and the quality is 10 times better. Plus, a 1000 camera deserves high quality lenses.4 -- don't forget the crop factor when you buy lenses!  It's hard to find this out on your own, but because of where the sensor is on Digital SLRS, you have to multiply the focal length of the lens by 1.6.  So, a 35 mm lens if you put it on this camera is equivalent to a 55mm lens, and so on.  Plus, if you have other non-digital cameras, be sure to be EF lenses only, not EF S which only fit on digital cameras.My only complaint (and this is nitpicking) on this camera is that I wish the finish were tougher looking and not quite so plasticky.  I like the Nikon cameras and upper level canon camera materials, but I understand that this is how Canon can sell a camera which is optically as good as the 10D for a lot less. On the plus side, it's nice and light.These are my thoughts after the first few weeks -- I LOVE the camera overall and now that I have two great lens, my pics look almost professional, not bad for a mom who doesn't know much about photography.", "Date": "February 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great 35MM SLR upgrade", "Author": "Reuben Gathright \"rgathright\"", "ReviewID": "R3AMO6H6WUTM9Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:Comes with battery and battery charger!I was able to use an aftermarket Canon zoom lens on this camera that fit my old Canon 35MM SLR!There is a popular BIOS upgrade on the net that will let you activate certian features found in the Canon 10D!Cons:Camera driver in Windows XP does not allow you to upload files.After I made certain complicated shots in the advanced shot modes, the camera locked up with error codes.

Ive had this camera for about a year, and Ive taken at least 2,000 pictures with it.  It's great, i enjoy it, thank you baby for getting it for me!If you have any kind of photo software on your computer, the Digital Rebel will work with it.  If you have some advanced software like Photoshop and iPhoto, it will sing!  Most of the photos, I simply import into iPhoto and from there, I can print to the Epson Stylus Photo 960 and get great results.  The 6.3 MP Digital Rebel takes such GREAT BIG pictures, that you can blow them up a little and not lose any detail.  You probably won't need to blow them up though because they are so big to start with.  At 100%, they are bigger than the largest computer screens.The difference in this and a smaller 4.0 MP camera (like my Canon S-40) is that you don't have to be so close to the subject to get a good picture.  From across a room, you can take a good shot, then zoom in when you crop.  It leaves a lot of room to zoom.I use a 256MB Compact Flash card and the camera shows to hold 71 shots at full resolution, though you may be able to get a couple more than that out of it.  So, if you get a 1GB card, it should easily hold a couple of hundred shots.  I would recommend an additional battery, a bag, and if you are really industrious, a larger lens.  I have a 30-200 (I think) and it only cost about $150.About the only thing I had trouble with, is that you cannot hold it out in front of you at arms length and see  your subject on the monitor before you take your shot like you do with smaller digital cameras.  It is because this is an SLR camera and you have to hold it up close and look thru the lens.  Dont buy this camera if this is a concern.  It does have a color monitor, but that is for reviewing the pictures after you have taken them and configuring the camera only.

On dpreview.com there is a comparison of SNR noise levels from the Rebel versus the Sony DSC-F828 at various ISO levels, and Rebel stomps the Sony. It makes sense: because of its larger sensor, the rebel gathers more light per pixel and thus has higher SNR. The noise level of the Rebel at ISO 1600 was less than that of the F828 at ISO 200. On DigitalCameraInfo.com there are very technical reviews of both cameras. They used an ISO resolution chart and Imatest software to measure the true effective resolution of the camera. The Rebel came up with 5.65 megapixels, while the F828 with it's higher resolution sensor could only muster 5.43 meapixels.

I've used it so far for landscapes, portrait, casual snapshots, and sports, and all of the pictures have been excellent.  I've had a number of them printed, including one at 20\"x30\".  Battery life is good, and I've yet to lose power during an outing.  Ergonomics are excellent and the camera is light and easy to carry all day.My suggestions for anyone buying this camera is to get a large memory card, (The pictures will take up about 3MB a-piece.) a USB 2.0 reader for downloads, and lots of ink and paper for your printer.", "Date": "April 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "It;s time to make the jump to digital", "Author": "Justarasta", "ReviewID": "R368NN5GOOYP8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been looking at digital cameras for over a year now and I have been holding off.  When this camera came out it got my attention.  I finally bought one three weeks ago when I was on a trip and I forgot my film point and shoot.  Had I known what this camera could do I would have bought it three months ago when I could have.  The camera functions great in fully automatic mode.  The automatic \"creative\" settings and the \"manual\" modes also work very well.  The only thing you have to watch for are the focus points which will vary so keeping clicking half way until they are on the important points.  The camera with the stock lens is plenty sharp - and this is coming from a long time Nikkor lens guy shooting on F2's and F3's.  Get a 1gig flash card and you will not believe how many large files you can get on a card.  Battery life is good for around 350 large photos with alot of flash shots, but you need a spare battery.  The 512 battery is less expensive and works as well if not better than the 511.  Do not bother to get a card reader - you do not need it.  It took this camera to get a dedicated 35mm shooter to make the jump.  The only problem is that now I have a whole different series of lens to buy.  I got a great deal on the 75-300 USM III lens and I have been happy with it.  You can and will shoot more photos than you ever did with a 35mm - and I generally shoot with a motor drive - and you will be amazed with the results.  Do not rely on the LCD to decide if you want to keep the shot - wait unitl you get home.  You get a video out cord to show the photos on a television.  My only question about the camera is its long term durability as it is not heavily built - but then again I'm used to shooting with a camera that is known to be a real tank.  I looked at the Sony 828 but it is not a SLR and the feature set is harder to access - aside from the numerous problems that we have heard about that camera.

Not to mention that the Canon 1Ds is the real revolutionary Pioneer camera. Then six months later, the Canon 10D came out, almost shocked the professionals and the amatuers alike with the quality, power and price. Now comes the Digital Rebel, with the same 6.3 megapixel as the 10D, but mounted on a Rebel body. In terms of the specifications, the Digital Rebel is only different from the 10D in two aspects, one is the 24 bit color depth vs. 36 bit in 10D, the other is the 2.5 frame per second of continous shooting for 4 frames, vs. 3 fps of 9 shoots in total in 10D. All other functions are all the same, including 30 to 1/4000 second shutter speed, 7 sensor focus screen and the same Canon new DIGIC image processor. But to my surprise, the Digital Rebel is at least two stops underexposure when shooting indoors. Espeicially, when shooting dark colored subjects, the exposure is extremely difficult to set right. I tried to use a 550EX external flash, and set the flash compensation to 1 2/3 overexposure when shooting my mahogany piano made by Hallet Davis Inc of Boston, and the exposure compensation is 1 stop overexposure, shutter speed was 1/60, aperture F 3.5.

Although I saw immediately that this camera was capable of taking great pictures my initial results were admittedly inconsistent. Some of the problems others had complained of (underexposures, focusing on the wrong object, etc) were happening to me. However, I now get very consistent results. The camera didn't change of course; I've just learned to use it properly. It lacks a few features found on some more expensive models but the picture quality can't be bettered at twice the price. Read the manual, use it, read the manual again, use it some more, etc. If you're willing to learn it's idiosyncrasies it will reward you with beautifully sharp and detailed photos. By the way, if you don't like to post-process your photos (I don't mind) you can turn up the sharpness, contrast, etc quite a bit above the default settings right in the camera. The built-in flash works as well as any (and better than many) with little red-eye. Several external flash units will also work very nicely with this camera. The kit lens feels cheap but produces good pictures. Even so, I've added a few more lenses to my arsenal. The one I use most is a Canon 28-135mm, image stabilized. Image stabilization (IS) is a great feature for low light photography at telephoto focal lengths.

It is by far the best digital camera on the market for the price!  Canon has put together a profesional quality digital camera for under 1000 dollars and this includes a great lense!  Many of the complaints I have read about this camera are simply because the user doesn't know how to read his operating manuel.  Gary stated he wanted more flexibility with this camera and that it took out of focus indoor photos.  This is not true at all!  The Rebel was designe to be very flexible and very automatic.  It has a scroll bar that is at finger tip that allows you to adjust the apeture or shutter speed.  It is fully manual or fully automatic.  It allows you to swap lenses from other EOS cameras giving it even more flexability.  Indoor shots are great if you know how to use the 7 focus points in the viewfinder.  It is hard for me to shoot a bad shot.  The download time from the camera to computer is slow, but I solved this with a 10 dollar memory card reader from Best Buy.  It's great.  Plug the memory card into the reader and attach it to any Windows XP USB port and it transfers even the large photos at a much faster speed.  Then you don't have to worry about carrying around a cable.  If your looking at spending around $1000 on a camera this is the one you need.

The best thing about the camera is the ability to take action shots.

I wanted to edit some of the pictures I took with photoshop, but even the photoshop told me the pictures were perfect and did not need to be edited.There are a few problems with the camera and most of them can be solved with a few accessories. One of the biggest problems is pictures shot indoor are underexposed, the built in flash is not powerfull enough. But all I had to do was buy a flash (420EX works great) and the problem is solved. Second problem is that the camera is very selective as far as lenses. I have a Rebel2000 with a Sigma 200mm lens and the lens did not work with my new camera.

The Sony DSC828 inspired me to take a fresh look at digicams.  I'm glad I didn't wait for it to become available.  What makes the quality of the D100 shots so much better than digicams?  I believe the #1 reason is the size of the sensor (the digital \"film\").  For example, the sensor in the Digital Rebel is 22.7mm by 15.1 mm.  The sensor in the up and coming Sony is only 8.8mm by 6.6mm.  That means that they have to pack all of the sensors in that much smaller of an area.  The result of the much smaller sensors is noise- random colored dots in darker areas of the picture.I've owned the camera for two weeks and on top of the nice lens that comes with it I purchased the Sigma 70-300mm F4-5.6 Macro Super II lens (Sigma # 507101).

The second day I had the camera I stopped at the grocery store after being out in the field shooting. I slid the camera into my holster bag and put it in the trunk.  When I returned, I grabbed the holster out of the trunk, forgetting that in my haste I had not zipped it shut.  You can only imagine my reaction as I watched my brand new camera literally bouncing end over end down the parking lot macadam (luckily it bounced over the lens).  I held my breath, turned it on and took a few shots.  I still can't believe it worked.  And despite a few dings in the plastic, the camera has performed flawlessly since.

I really like it as well, but it's quite the upgrade from my old SLR and the string of point-and-shoots I've had since then.Pros:Super cheap for a DSLRIt takes better pics at 6.3MP than my 12MP point-and-shoot that cost me 3x more.It's a DSLR... it is very configurable.Cons:It's old technology -- 6.3MPThe LCD doesn't display the pic until you've taken it, meaning I have nose grease all over the back.It uses CompactFlash memory -- typical for its era.Would like it to have the option to take a string of 3-5 pics via timer.If you're considering using older SLR accessories, here are some pointers:Old EF lenses are compatible, though it is designed for use with the newer EF-S lenses.EF lenses increase the effective zoom by about 1.6x.  That means my old 80-200mm lens turns out to be 128-320mm!!!  It also means my old 35-80 lens is 55-128mm, meaning I'm always zoomed in some.  To do macro shots, get a 18-55mm EF-S lens.EF lenses don't have image stabilization.  That's a sweet feature, especially when zoomed in to 320mm.

I stopped at a Store 24and bought a disposible camera. Somehow....purchasing disposale camera's for special events became the \"norm\" for me.(But, I still missed my Polaroid's instant gratification).When I got married in 91, my husband brought his huge, heavy, Canon T70 SLR.I was terrified to use it.I thought for sure I would break it .... (just like my girlfriends rotten kids broke my camera).When my new hubby saw my apprehension... he shrugged and said to me......\"just point and shoot\".So, I did.I was amazed at the clarity of the lens and how easy it was to focus. (i was instantly hooked).I ran around the house and yard... and shot the entire roll of film.When we got the film back (about a week later), I saw that I had taken several really lousy shots....but 70% of the pictures (I took) came out really good!!!!  I was very impressed by the picture clarity and colors of an SLR.(But, I still missed the instant gratification of my old polaroid).Two years later....My husband and I became \"Master Gardeners\".(Some people call us...Tree hugging, bug kissing, nuts).I heard about a contest that \"Ortho\" and \"WalMart\" were sponsoring.It was called :  \"THE BEST GARDEN IN AMERICA\".I grabed my husbands Canon SLR (film) camera and his camera books .and I studied them. Then I took about  200 pictures of our garden.And after a couple of days, I picked up the pictures..... choose the best picture and entered it in the contest.A lot of work....but it paid off.Yup!.... We won best garden in the North East!!!Since then, my husband and I have taken about a trillion pictures of our garden.10% are awful !!!, 20% are lousy!! .... 30% good!....and  40% fantastic!This January I sat down and looked at all our garden pictures.I always do  this in the dead of  winter .....cause the beauty of the flowers always makes me smile.

It probably offers the right number of features and full user controllability. I've never used a camera in which ISO and exposure are so easily and quickly modified for each shot.Considerably smaller cameras do have larger LCD displays, though you don't need the LCD to view your subject. I wonder why, since many camcorders offer a \"night shot\" option, Canon could not also include that on this camera. I also miss the high speed connection that is standard on many camcorders. (Firewire, and now new Firewire 800, are faster than USB 1/2.)

It felt heavy and awkward, and didn't seem a significant improvement over the A80. I also had a problem with the lens(an upgrade from the lens kit). The auto focus servo malfunctioned, only worked in one direction and the camera could not focus at all in low light. I returned the EOS camera and lens and bought the Nikon D70 and 18-70 lens kit, the other option for serious prosumer gear. WOW, what a difference and what a beautiful camera! Amazing image/color quality, fast auto focus, with low-light beam assist. The metering is dead-on precise, i can even get an accurate exposure with 30 second shutter speeds! Changing film speed, white balance, apeture, shutter speed is one touch controlled with dials at thumb and forefinger.  The menu works like windows with very easy to access and use.  The lens is a wider focal range and better quality than the Rebel kit. The D70 feels great in the hand: solid, lighweight with natural ergonomics.

As an entry level DSLR it does what it's supposed to do in ideal conditions. I find it's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light, provided that they are not moving.Cons:In landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well.Battery dies FAST. The battery I got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting, especially when shooting in RAW mode. I have yet to fill up a 1Gig card when shooting in RAW mode(Approx 150 shots) before the battery dies. Surprisingly when shooting jpegs, I get more shots per charge(Over 300) but hardly enough to last a day. I cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while I was out on a hike. So I always carry a backup film camera (my trusty Elan 7).The viewfinder is very dim. When I look through my Elan 7 and then through the 300D, it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300D's viewfinder. In indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap, especially when having to resort to manual focus.Autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible. When shooting indoors, the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject. I have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur. This is despite having a 420Ex Flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus.The 420EX flash is supposed to \"talk\" to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed. However, with the 300d, this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed.After about five months, the shutter button started sticking. I would click it and then it would remain depressed. The shutter button would only pop back up after I jiggled it a little.Another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button. And since there is only one thumbwheel, it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed. For example, if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature, then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel. When you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera, this is a real annoyance.So would I recommend this camera:If you are a casual point and shoot person, it's an affordable entry into DSLRs that produces decent photos.

I added a Canon EF 28-105mm ultrasonic lens last year and have enjoyed the results, although I found early on that the new lens no longer allowed me the luxury of shooting on autofocus.  Okay, so, necessity forced me to learn to love manual operation of the DigiReb.Media cards - Generally, I've used and sworn by SanDisk 512MB CF cards.  They've never failed me, and have allowed me to reuse them many times over.  About a year ago I bought a Hitachi 4GB Microdrive media card and while I loved the storage space, I found that the processing time was far slower than a simple 1GB SanDisk CF card I also purchased.  Not so infrequently, when shooting with the Microdrive, I found that the card didn't record an image, but instead I'd see the dreaded \"Corrupted data\" message on the LCD where I'd hope to see an image.Let's also talk batteries.  I've noticed on cold days that the proprietary Canon lithium batteries for the Digital Rebel drain down quickly in cold temps - today's temps in DC were in the high-20's to low-30's.  And I do think that you are hardpressed to get through one day of serious shutterbugging (say, traveling through Tuscany, where you could easily snap off 300 shots) without going through one lithium battery and half of another.  Let's face it - when you're shooting on manual and trying to adjust for the light with a bright sky but a less than bright street scene, you want to check the LCD to see whether you need to adjust and take another shot.  And that means you're going to go thru batteries.Earlier today I went out for a hike at Great Falls Park, taking the camera along, with those frosty temps ready to drain the lone battery I took along.  I was able to capture a few early shots, and while the battery power quickly went from reading full to less than half full, the camera continued to work...except that it simply took blank images - all black...!  Battery was present, microdrive was loaded, lens cap was off, shutter depressed, photo seemed to have been taken, but nothing showed up on the LCD.  Not even a \"Corrupt Data\" message.  Only a dark screen.So, this afternoon I've purchased a SanDisk Extreme III 2GB CF card, have recharged my batteries and am indoors, with an ambient room temp in the low 70's.  Fired up the DigiReb, shot a handful of images, and...I'm still getting the black screen of death.  The DigiReb and it's flash are snapping away, but something's missing.

The price of the Rebel digital was also great incentive. I have also had a ton of fun with my mother's Nikon D100. I was hoping that the picture quality of the Rebel would be comparable to the Nikon without the cost.I purchased the Rebel Digital a couple of weeks ago and it is already in the shop - re: back to back pictures of the same subject /same distance using on camera flash and also 420 EX flash resulted in very different exposures. First very light, next very dark, etc etc.Made no sense to me at first or to the guy at the camera shop. I was first sent home with the directions to wait longer in between shots to allow the flash more time to 're-energize'. This didn't sit well with me but I tried it - still no cure. After taking it back the second time they sent it to the shop. The camera guy took 2 of his own photos back to back and WOW I am not an idiot after all and away the camera went to Canon. Haven't heard back yet.After e-mailing Canon myself this is what they had to say:Please remember that metering is linked to the active AF point. If youfocus (meter) on a very light area of the subject, the camera willexpose for that area. As a result, darker areas of the same subject mayappear underexposed. Using the camera's AE Lock (or FE Lock, for flashimages) function should improve your results. Alternatively, you canmeter on a more moderately toned area of the image.Anyway, after kicking myself in the butt, I went back to the camera shop and requested a new camera body as I am not comfortable with having a camera less than a week and having it in the shop already. So they agreed and gave me another. Much to my surprise this one did the same thing (not as bad though). The guy told me that I needed the 10D his reasons were not quite clear. My guess is a combination of speed and exposure setting differences as well as autofocus ability? (If anyone cares check out the 9 point autofocus of the new 20D - Very Impressive!)Bottom line if you are not a SLR user you may not even notice these slight but to me very irritating differences in exposure so spend the money and have fun.

Circuit City has a pretty poor return-to-exchange program for cameras, 14 days!??! and it took me longer than that to find out that my camera has AF problems.You don't have to look very far on the net to see that a *significant* fraction of Canon 300D and 10D camera buyers are finding that the cameras do not always produce sharp pictures. For those so stricken, it is a toss up whether the picture they are about to take will have focus at the right spot, or the wrong spot, or be overall much too soft (\"soft\" is too kind - shot through a vaseline coated lens is almost a better description). Such a life is miserable. If you can't trust your camera, then photography becomes torture.The camera and lenses are clearly capable of sharp pictures, I have a number that came out, but I could not rely on it. Buying more lenses in an effort to get around or test the problem just sunk me into a black hole of expenditure and confounded me further as the camera refused to obey any consistent pattern of misbehavior.User error you say? I'm not some point and shooter who has never seen an SLR before, nor someone from film who is pleased with 4x6\" prints that look sharp. I've used an F707 for a year and bad digitals before that, and good SLRs before that as well. I know an out of focus picture when I see one! I know canon tends to slightly blur even perfectly focused pictures to achieve a \"naturalistic\" look, but that is not the problem I saw. I saw that AF point of focus was not repeatable, that AF strips were much too big, that spot AF was if anything less accurate that auto-AF, and on top of that, if the camera did the right thing, then Canon zoom glass was a pretty poor show at 6 megapixels unless you worried constantly about aperture and extreme zooms.On top of all this I read (but do not care) that the camera has exposure issues when using the flash, and have the white balance on \"auto\" is worse than useless unless it is a sunny day. Lastly, the camera went through a phase when its firmware ate entire sub-folders of pictures on my 1gb CF card.Unfortunately, after reading about others with focus and softness issues with the Canon 10D (which shares basically the same sensor and system as the 300D) I had no confidence that Canon would acknowledge there was a problem with my example or a problem with the model, and no interest in waiting weeks in the hope they might be nice. So I sold the lot, at a ridiculous loss, and am retiring to lick my wounds and wait until Canon sorts out its production line quality control problems or is exposed for making a camera that does not have tolerances up to its megapixels.It is obscene for Canon to suggest that anyone who wants to see accurate focus down the pixel level at a mere 6mp spend thousands on \"L\" series lenses, or thousands on the 1D.Good luck on your purchase, maybe you'll get one that can AI focus correctly and does not suffer the problems I saw. Or perhaps if you're coming from cheap digitals or from basic film you won't notice the problems, and are the ideal customer for Canon! I'm missing my F707 badly and waiting for the next round of those types of cameras before getting back. Or perhaps I'll pickup a second-hand F717 while people trade up to the F828.A digital SLR is nice for action shots, the mirror slap sound is cool (although does it add to camera shake?), but the cost of glass and the amount of equipment necessary for decent shots is extraordinary.", "Date": "February 15, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great When It Works", "Author": "Pecan Bob", "ReviewID": "R37XF1IO6YSOZD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I received this from Amazon and went thru several test shots I was amazed at how good it really was.", "Date": "December 25, 2003"}, {"Title": "no show on  product - a week after ordered, store cancelled.", "Author": "\"sherrilange\"", "ReviewID": "R14BQKDT8LVG2D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "disappointed that i waited for a week before i was informed product was not available. had received email confirms that order was to be shipped and then no word, then i emailed for status and was informed it was a cancelled order. i bought it somewhere else the day i found out and paid extra to ensure it shipped in time for xmas. a very unprofessional transaction. the camera is fantastic. my boyfriend can't stop taking photos. but i wont buy from this place again - too risky, poor communication.", "Date": "January 9, 2004"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Dazzling resolution: the 6.3 megapixel CMOS sensor\nThe speed to capture the shots that won't wait\nPerfect white balance for clear, true color\nReproducing and sharing your images is as exciting as creating them", "Name": "Canon EOS 6.3MP Digital Rebel Camera (Body Only)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61X2wYxuxKL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0000C8VU8"}}
