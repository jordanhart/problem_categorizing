She wanted a $300 touch screen camera but it wasn't in the budget. She loves this one. The low light performance is good and it is great for the \"extended arm self portrait.\" She took it on her senior trip (yes, I gave it to her early) and she took over 1000 photo's with it with better than average results. She also really likes the panoramic mode. Overall it's a good choice for a casual camera.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "So far so good..", "Author": "Lindsay \"Lindsay\"", "ReviewID": "R374J2S4JP3H6Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because it was inexpensive but still had most of the features I was looking for in a camera. It uses 2 AA batteries, but they do last quite a while. Overall, the camera is great. It takes great pictures and has a lot of options for settings. My favorite is a panoramic feature which I have had a little difficulty with but haven't read about it. It also comes with a CD which has great photoshopping features. The only problem I have noticed so far is the video capture. It does not take a good video by any means, the voice is okay but when playing videos back, it's extremely delayed and broken. So if you are looking for a camera for mostly video purposes, this camera isn't for you! Other than that, it's totally worth the price!", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pentax Optio E90", "Author": "P. L.
