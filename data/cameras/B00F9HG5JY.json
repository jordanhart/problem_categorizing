{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT value - batteries work better than OEM", "Author": "Long Live the C64! \"LongLiveC64\"", "ReviewID": "R3NGQ7LGXGX3ME", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently ordered a Pentax digital camera that uses these type of batteries.  The camera only came with one battery (and no external charger; you had to open the battery slot and use a proprietary cable to charge the camera directly).So I figured I would give this kit a try.First, I charged the batteries.  They fit loosely in the charger, so at first I feared the wrong charger was shipped.  But after reversing the direction, I was able to charge 'em quickly (less than an hour each).The batteries powered up my camera just fine (although again, much to my amazement the batteries can easily be inserted in reverse).I decided to do a little test of the new batteries vs the OEM that came with the camera.  I cranked up the camera screen brightness level, turned off the power-saving features, and started my stopwatch.  1:07 (one hour and seven minutes) later, the camera ran out of OEM juice completely and shut down.Next, I did the identical test using one of the new Halcyon batteries.  1:36 (one hour and thirty-six minutes) the camera shut down.  That is a BIG improvement over the OEM battery, which roughly corresponds with the mAH rating printed on the batteries.Bottom line, these batteries are the real deal and are a bargain for anyone who wants to have some spares (and an extra charger); I'm still amazed that they last SO much longer than OEM.
