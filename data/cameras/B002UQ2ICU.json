A lot easier to learn the scope on your first nights, watch the alignment process and view pictures taken with the CCD camera.

It makes everything so much easier and clearer to follow, especially for someone with basic tech skills such as myself. We'll worth the investment, although I was shocked that I had to pay extra import duty on top of the amount I was advised.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice but not worth the price", "Author": "D.

I am happy with the quality, but do wish it had some kind of cover that could be folded over it while viewing through the telescope eyepiece, as the screen brightness can mess with your night vision. I plan to make a small canvass cover that will reduce the problem.However, I am happy with the unit, and it is a great addition to my telescope. I have a 5 year old granddaughter who is curious about everything, and the display screen will help her understand what we are looking at in the sky.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.00", "Features": "For use with Meade LS Light Switch telescopes\nDesigned to display the 75+ on-board animated videos\nComplete with mounting bracket and battery pack\nA great way to enhance your ETX-LS telescope experience", "Name": "Meade LS 3.5 Inch Color LCD Video Monitor", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-JIrCKqhL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002UQ2ICU"}}
