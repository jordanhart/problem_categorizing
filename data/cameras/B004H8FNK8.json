I have used this camera during last weekend shooting under daylight, indoor and low light condition and I am really impressed with camera.What I like:- Outside shooting: Excellent picture- Indoor shooting: Excellent picture even under auto mode. Apparently we cannot compare with DSL camera but the picture quality is much better than previous Sony digital cameras that I owned (See uploaded images)- Superior Auto Mode: a new feature that automatically reduce blur and noise after each shooting.- Sweep Panorama is great and time saving- 3D picture is a nice feature, I tried it with my 3D TV and it looks great, although it is not as good as you are watching 3D movie from Bluray but you actually can see some depths of the image.- 1080i movie recording is great even watching on 55\" TV.- Can use both SDHC & Duo cards.- Inexpensive for a extra battery, $12 from Amazon.What I do not like or need some time to adapt:- Battery is not so good (The bright 921K XtraFine screen should be the main reason) but a spare battery can fix this.- The screen easily captures your fingerprints. Looking for the screen protection.- Need some time to learn using dial control for mode changing.- Superior Auto Mode: needs about 2 seconds after each shot to process the image. When you want to act fast, this mode should not be your choice.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "A very good camera.

Oh... get another battery for this puppy as well.  I took about 245 shots and two short videos before my camera went out.  THAT was my fault.  :-)**I've had this camera for about three weeks now.  Did not know my review would be this long.  Sorry.**  :-)After months of looking, researching, web surfing, asking friends, bugging friends, waiting, and Google picture searching, I have FINALLY chosen the Sony Cybershot DX9 as my next point and shoot camera.  A tiny bit of history:  My first digital camera was a Sony Cybershot DSCN1 8.1 MP and was an absolutely magnificent camera.  I had it for 5 years before I fatally dropped and killed it.  My second digital camera was the Sony DSC-T99 and the absolute WORST camera I have ever owned!  I had no problem being loyal to Sony because of the DSCN1 but they almost ruined it with the T99!  So I made it a point to do so much research for my next camera, Dan Brown would be jealous.  I used so many websites to do my research I felt like that geek who started FaceBook.Here are the cameras that were in the running:  Canon Power Shot SX230HS, Sony Cybershot DSC-WX9, Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS10, Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS3, and the Nikon Coolpix S9100.Given everything that today's P&S; cameras possess, I was just looking for one thing:  it had to take very good pictures.  Period.  I know, I know, I know... get a DSLR.  Maybe one day, but for today I just want a P&S; that could fit in my pocket grab that perfect shot.  I KNOW for a fact that P&S; cameras can take great photos because I had one, the DSCN1.  So I know it could happen; I just wanted it to happen again.  Having panorama shots, 3-D, Hi-Def video, GPS, and other bells and whistles are all well and good but (again) I just wanted a camera that would echo or exceed the pictures my DSCN1 took.  I'll try and post links to the picture albums that I took with my various cameras so you can see the difference in picture quality.This first initial posting of this review will be a condensed journal or sorts with me adding stuff willy-nilly as I learn more and experience more with this camera.Here goes...Control Wheel:  After a few days of use (and taking pictures of every useless thing I could think of) I have grown weary of the control wheel.  This is easily the albatross around the neck of this camera.  I have started teaching myself to use the \"menu\" button because it is much easier to navigate than the wheel.  My problem with the wheel is that it's extremely sensitive and you need to have fingers the size of Tom Thumb to work it with no problems.  Now, I WAS able to get the hang of it after practice... but why bother when I can get to the EXACT same functions with the \"menu\" button?  However, don't get me wrong here, the control wheel is a very important functioning part of this camera, and Sony has worked it so that you have to use it to get to a lot of the different scenes.  All I'm saying is that the less you use it the smoother your working of this camera will be. (PLEASE bring back the touch screen Sony).The menu:  While nice, takes some getting used to but once you do, you'll fly through it.  There was a little scratching of my head when I was trying to figure out the difference between \"intelligent auto\" and \"superior auto\".  I imagine there were some chuckles in the board room on that one.  There is also a small delay when passing the 3-D icon.  I imagine this is because the camera has to set itself for a whole different set of parameters when doing that.  Nothing big, but worth a mention.Focus: Focusing is good on regular shots, but not great when you use the full aspect of the 5x zoom.  It could be better and the pictures do lose some of that \"bite\" when you get in a little too far, but I think that is just par for the course with a P&S.; (right?)Movies: Admittedly I've only taken a few token videos only because I wanted to see if I could.  I don't see myself using this feature a lot, but if I come across something good I'll let you know.  The test videos I have taken have turned out very nice and VERY clear.  Sony also gives you three video settings to choose from; highest image quality (1920x1080/24M), high image quality (1920x1080/17M), and standard image quality (1440x1080/9M).  I also like the fact that you can zoom while filming and that you can snap pictures while filming video.Picture quality in regular light:  this is a paradox for me so I'll try to be as clear as I can.  The pictures this camera takes are very good.  But I was honestly looking for something a lot better since they have had five years of work since the DSCN1.  At best the picture quality equals the picture quality of the DSCN1.  Again, this would be OK if this camera was only one year out from the previous model... but not five.  I'm happy with the pictures, I just expected more.  There is also (sometimes) the issue of when you don't use the provided software to extract the pictures; there is sometimes a small black \"void\" near the bottom of the video and pictures.  Action shots are a breeze with this camera as well.Picture quality in medium light: These are pretty good as well.  In the WX9 picture album I put in a picture of a gorgeous nighttime sky.  That was taken without a tripod and a preset (I'm sorry I can't remember which one) scene setting.  The indoor picture I took were OK too... as long as I didn't zoom in too much.  That zoom really is not this camera's friend.  You will see more grain with the indoor pictures if you blow them up.  If you don't blow the pictures up the size of posters you'll be OK.Picture quality in low light: In this case my low light was 1 candle.  We had a power outage about two days ago and I was able to play with this feature while smarter people than myself tried to figure out why I didn't have power but the house directly behind me did.  Taking pictures in low light is not for the novice.  You don't have to be a pro, but knowing where to place the camera and using the tripod is a must.  The pictures turned out pretty well but still not as well as my former DSCN1.  The handheld shots were a little grainy, but that is to be expected.  Again, my only disappointment was that these pictures were only as good as my previous Sony.  The tripod pictures, of course, turned out much better.  Grain only showed up when I blew the picture up on my laptop.  What turned out to be a nice surprise was that the \"background de-focus\" mode worked in the low light.  BONUS!  I tried every low light setting this camera offered and was pretty pleased... as long as I was using my tripod.  Without it the pictures were not good, but that's my fault not Sony's.  Sony is touting its new Exmor R CMOS sensor pretty hard.  They advertise that it will deliver \"stunning\" low light pictures.  It delivers very good low light pictures but \"stunning\" is pushing it.Battery: So far so good.  When it is fully charged I have no worries that it won't last out what I'm trying to do.  I can't tell you how it runs at \u00bd charge and below because I'm the type of guy that recharges all of my gadgets at night so that I'll be ready to go.  And since you can charge this camera using your laptop with the supplied tiny USB cord, you should be in good shape on the days of heavy shooting.  Just for giggles I did run the power down using the slideshow feature and `Planet Rock' music I downloaded.  It took a little over two hours at \u00be battery power.3-D: I haven't been able to see pictures on a 3-D TV but when you take a 3-D picture with this camera, you CAN see it 3-D.  It's slight but it is there.  You can also see the 3-D picture without the use of those Amish-ugly 3-D glasses.  It's actually pretty cool.Summation: Taken everything into consideration I am happy with this camera so far.  I take it everywhere with me and its small enough to fit in my pants pocket without that embarrassing bulge.  I think this camera will easily fit your needs for a very good P&S; camera and then some.  Yeah, I'll always wish back to the days of the DSCN1, but until someone invents a *working* time machine I'll happily use my new WX9.Pros:* The LCD screen is stunningly gorgeous.  So much so that the pictures look better on my camera than they do on my laptop. (#crappylaptopfail).*  Beautiful camera design.* The video is beautiful.* Image quality***. (see above)* Plenty of shooting modes to choose from.* Very light and a great size to throw in your pocket or purse.* I love how you can switch the corporate elevator music with music of your choice for the slideshow playback.  The only drawback is that you have to use Sony's supplied software on the CD they give you.  Unfortunately it's typical gimmicky photo software that you can EASILY do without.  I installed it just to give it a test run and I'm going to keep it ONLY because I want to use it to switch the music.  Seriously, how cool is it that now I can play `Planet Rock' while showing my pictures?  BONUS!!Cons:* I'm not a big fan of the control wheel.  If you have big fingers I feel bad for you.  Too many times I kept inadvertently kept hitting the button in the middle as I was trying to switch modes.  DSCN1 had a touch screen and why they got rid of that I will NEVER know.* Image quality (I know, I know... how can it be a pro and a con?).  While the image quality is good, I still find myself wishing back to the picture quality of the DSCN1.  The picture aren't *bad* but I expected a lot more after five years of technology between cameras.* While using the video feature you can hear the camera if you use the zoom.* If you have the money, there are better point and shoot cameras that can handle low light photography better.Side Notes:* The battery can be charged via a battery pack plugged into camera and plugged into wall, or USB cord plugged into camera plugged into computer.* I use a Transcend 4GB Class 10 SDHC memory card as my main baby and a Lexar 8GB Class 2 memory card for backup and extra storage.* If you have any other questions please feel free to ask me here or e-mail me at [...] and I'll do my best.* Because someone ALWAYS asks, this camera was not on a strict lay down date and I was able to order it through a camera store in another state (I live in CA).

Since I received this camera in the mail from Amazon.com, (Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX9 16MP 5x optical) I have been very pleased with it. My motivation for buying this particular camera came from the failure of my previous camera (Kodak EasyShare Z1485 IS 14MP 5x optical). My final decision to buy the WX9 came from three things: the first reason was that it had all the features and more of my previous camera, the second reason was that of the price ($164) which was $40-$60 cheaper than the local retail stores e.g. Bestbuy, Walmart, Costco, Officemax, at the time it was purchased; and the third reason was that it had descent reviews from  Amazon as well as Cnet.  Below I list some of the pros and cons I have observed, but not extensively as it would take a long time to find and write and a waste of your time as well.Pros:* Loaded with actual helpful features (such as an in camera feature guide that walks you through the function.)*  Fast cycle time. This allows you to take photos at a quick rate (however, in some modes it will take longer, naturally)*  Slim and light design, makes it easy to carry and to find a case for.*  Good picture quality. The 16 megapixels, 5x optical zoom, and image stabilization help a lot with simple (and shaky) point and shoot photography.*  Ability to shoot in 1920x1080 video.Cons:* Battery life could be longer, I was able to get approximately 200 photos (many with the flash on) and a short video on one charge of the battery which comes with the camera. However this is the price one pays for the slim camera design.*  The scroll wheel is novel,(reminds me of my Sandisk MP3 player), but tends to lag and can get annoying. Use the scroll wheel and the menu buttons together to avoid this problem.*  You cannot set the shutter speed for custom exposure or manually focus the lens. Most people would probably not care about these functions in a camera of this type, but for myself it was my biggest disappointment as my previous, and cheaper, camera had these features. (For those of you who are wondering what I need these functions for, I used them for tricky lighting such as sunsets and for capturing lightning.)*  The video, (at least the 1920x1080 modes I have observed) are interlaced video, making it necessary to convert video for advanced video editing.  After owning the camera and having used it for 10 days (at the time I am writing this review) and 876 pictures and 20 videos later, I have come to the conclusion that the Cyber-shot DSC-WX9 is, in my opinion, a very good camera for the price in terms of functionality and features. My advice to anyone who decides to get this camera is to: try all the features in as many situations as possible(this is the best way to find out how to use this camera); take as many different exposures, at least what is possible and practical, of what you are shooting; buy a spare battery (Wasabi Power had a good combo deal on Amazon.com at the time this review was written); and always try to keep your camera handy as many great shots come available with little notice.Thank you for reading my review.Hopefully it has been helpful to you in some way.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very nice cam for the price.", "Author": "amir9910", "ReviewID": "RPDGD557KGJ7H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm gonna make it short:PROS:- amazing daytime photos with vibrant colors.- nice slow syncro flash mode.- video quality is awesome.- the price is unbeatable.- Nice panoramic photosCONS:- slow and lagged user interface.- microphone sucks. any simple breeze will cause distortion in sound. if you want a camera to use at clubs, bars or other loud places, this one in not for you.- backlit sensor almost makes no difference. still very grainy photos in Twilight Handheld mode.- does not come with a case- you can hear the lens motor in videos when zooming in/out", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointing  still photos and ergonomics", "Author": "E. Dowd", "ReviewID": "REXSMFW0PRCLM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this at Target a week ago, tested it extensively on still photos, and returned it after three days.I have been an amateur photographer since the days of folding cameras. I used also an early fixed lens slr (name escapes me), and then Olympus compacts, then Olympus Pen FT, then Olympus OM 1, then a Nikon 5000 digital compact, then a Sony w12 digital compact which is very sharp outdoors, and now a Canon G12. I got fine results with all of them. I wanted to get a smaller compact that I can take with me everyday, in a pocket or a briefcase. The G12 is an absolutely wonderful camera, excellent photos under all reasonable conditions, but too heavy and bulky to carry every single day, though it would be my choice for traveling. My Sony W12 took thousands of sharp travel photos but was becoming decrepit, so I first got the G12 and then the Sony wx9. After I returned the wx9 i bought a Canon SX 230 HS, another great camera and sufficiently small to take with me every day.What is relevant for you, the reader, is that I was able to test these cameras against each other, on the same objects, indoors and outdoors, so you have a reference point to judge the wx9.Outdoors: the wx9 was somewhat less sharp than the G12, W12, and sx 230. In addtion, n three outdoor  shots out of 15 the wx9 overexposed; one was overexposed about three stops, and two were overexposed by about two stops. On the overexposed shots, the camera chose ISO 800 on a sunny day and did not choose a high enough shutter speed, hence the  overexposure.Indoors on a fairly well lighted bookcase six feet from my desk: the wx9 was considerably less sharp than the other three cameras.Indoors in a fairily dimly lighted room: the wx9 was considerably better than the w12, which is miserable in dim light, and about as good as  the G12 and sx 230 hs. Shots at ISO 400 began to get grainy, and at ISO 800 were very grainy.So I took the wx9 back and kept the canon sx 230 hs which is giving excellent results. Of course I am surprised and disapponted that the wx9 is not as sharp outdoors as the W12 nor did  it give consistent correct exposures.I did not test the video since this is not a strong interest of mine. Apparently video  is a great strength of the wx9. Also it apparently gives 3D photos, and easily makes panoramic photos, though I did not try either of these.A further problem with the wx9 is that the menu system was hard for me to navigate, despite the explanatory text at the bottom of the screen ( a very good idea.)The wx9  is flakey in a couple of other ways: the battery has to be charged in the camera. And I have heard that the videos  are hard to download into a Mac.One thing I conclude from my testing experience is that cameras are now so complex that I can no longer safely rely on the fully automatic function, which served me so well with the sony w12. It is now a huge advantage to have access to aperture priority and shutter priority and exposure compensation.I read a lot of reviews of various cameras before buying the wx9 but there were few reviews of this camera at the time I boiught it. I have a couple of comments on reviews that may be of help to you.One is that I prefer digitalcamerareview.com for the most candid and intelligent reviews. Their review of the wx9 is expected the week of May 9. I am sorry I did not have access to it.My second comment is that expert reviewers are very hesitant to say that one camera is much better than its rivals; they try to do this indirectly with percentage ratings, but these percentages are usually within one to four points of each other, and so are not very helpful. However, the  infosync.com, reviewer while being very guarded indeed in comparing cameras, does occasionally tell you what he really thinks, by means of a metaphor at the very end of the video review. Thus the canon G12, at the end of the review is described as a \"great little brick of excellence.\" The canon sx 230 hs is described as \"a fully decked out Mercedes Benz in the parking lot of compact cameras.\"If  you want a truly subcompact like the wx9 in size, you could look at the Canon Elph 300 hs. It is very small; you would have to check out whether it is good optically and ergonomically.Hope this helps in your decision. Your needs and experience may be quite different from mine so you may reach a different conclusion.Update: The review by digitalcamerareviews.com has now appeared and is very favorable to the wx9, which is good to see.In their conclusions of the wx9 review, they say \"good image quality, even in low light.\" and \"excellent HD video.\"In the conclusions of the sx 230 hs, a larger and considerably more expensive compact, digital camera reviews says \"excellent image quality' and \"superb HD video quality.\"In my own experience, I found the wx9 image quality to be not as good as the sx 230 image quality outdoors. Your experience, under different conditions,may be quite different and I hope it is. The wx9 will generate a lot of expert reviews, and a lot of reviews here by customers, and you will be able to make a more broad-based judgement.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for the money", "Author": "I. Ming \"Meticulous shopper\"", "ReviewID": "RFIS8XDTOG684", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My past two point and shoot cameras were Canons and I had pretty much decided on the Elph 500 back in March '11. Long story short, I picked SONY over Canon because I have had enough of Canon always taking forever to launch new products and charging hefty premiums for their reputation, marginally better image quality and popularity. Canon products are always playing catch up in innovation and technology (think wide lens, LCD resolution, focus speeds, back lit sensor, true HD movie and what not).The Sony WX9 captures very good video, both in bright and low light conditions. I am extremely pleased with this purchase and I am so glad I switched.(and I am the type who is very loyal to my brands)I love the panoramic (panning) capture feature. I could easily capture a full shot of the Yankee stadium (and still maintain on a 4 by 6 aspect ratio for Facebook uploading). It's a very convenient feature, especially if you always felt that you camera was just never wide enough (even at 24 mm). I now have the option to shoot an \"ultra wide\" picture without the drawback of \"fish eye\" distortions.The portrait feature with background blurring is pretty neat too. It just gives me option to get more creative with my compositions. My Facebook friends are loving those shots. Normally you can only pull off this effect with a DSLR and a pro-sumer lens. But who caries a DSLR for dinner or party.  The LCD screen is amazing too. It has one of the highest resolution in its class and it is very crisp and sharp.Of course, this camera has flaws too, and then quite a big one. The battery performance average at best. Its stamina is about half of what I am used too with a Canon camera. I resolved the issue by getting a second battery and charger which are readily available on Ebay. I reckon that shooting movies in HD requires more battery power. Sony like their camera to be as thin as possible and I guess that's why all their line of camera have below average stamina. The trade-off is reasonable.Overall, I'm very happy with this product. I would recommend the WX9 to anyone in a heart beat.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera for the price!", "Author": "Eliot Pooh", "ReviewID": "R35ZN02N2QC9OI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have now had the WX9 for a week, and I can say that at $200, this camera is a great bang for the buck! The image quality is superb in good lighting, and remains excellent if one uses the \"Superb\" auto mode; I really am very pleasantly surprised at how the mode can produce such good results on a very compact point and shoot.Many of the features I believed to be mere gimmicks, I find that I am using frequently. Panoramas are very easy to take and allow for countless possibilities of unique shots that couldn't otherwise be taken. The background defocus mode, although admittedly not a perfect a replica of the bokeh effect one can achieve on a DSLR, is a good enough replacement to convince almost anyone. The HDR mode is also very useful in situations where you need to take a picture of a subject with a window, or other light source in the background.The 3'' display is also one of the highlights of the camera. With its 921k dots, it is incredibly sharp and colorful. Most other point and shoots have only 230k displays and the better ones have 460k displays. This camera beats them all! One little gripe I have with it is that it gets smudgy very easily. I think Sony should apply oleophobic coating, like the one used on the iPhones, on its cameras' displays given their size and the importance in the cameras' usage.I also don't appreciate the click-wheel controls. I'm getting used to it now, but I don't understand why Sony just didn't use a 4-way d-pad instead, which would have made the controls easier.I initially thought the 16mp count to be excessive, and that it would only introduce a lot of noise into the pictures, but the camera really takes much larger pictures than a 10mp camera while retaining image quality.Of course, don't expect DSLR-like or even $500-camera-like results, but if you intend to use at least some of the features of the camera, I believe you can't get any better than the WX9 for 200 bucks!", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "A very good camera.

I also like the fact that you can zoom while filming and that you can snap pictures while filming video.Picture quality in regular light:  this is a paradox for me so I'll try to be as clear as I can.  The pictures this camera takes are very good.  But I was honestly looking for something a lot better since they have had five years of work since the DSCN1.  At best the picture quality equals the picture quality of the DSCN1.  Again, this would be OK if this camera was only one year out from the previous model... but not five.  I'm happy with the pictures, I just expected more.  There is also (sometimes) the issue of when you don't use the provided software to extract the pictures; there is sometimes a small black \"void\" near the bottom of the video and pictures.  Action shots are a breeze with this camera as well.Picture quality in medium light: These are pretty good as well.  In the WX9 picture album I put in a picture of a gorgeous nighttime sky.  That was taken without a tripod and a preset (I'm sorry I can't remember which one) scene setting.  The indoor picture I took were OK too... as long as I didn't zoom in too much.  That zoom really is not this camera's friend.  You will see more grain with the indoor pictures if you blow them up.  If you don't blow the pictures up the size of posters you'll be OK.Picture quality in low light: In this case my low light was 1 candle.  We had a power outage about two days ago and I was able to play with this feature while smarter people than myself tried to figure out why I didn't have power but the house directly behind me did.  Taking pictures in low light is not for the novice.  You don't have to be a pro, but knowing where to place the camera and using the tripod is a must.  The pictures turned out pretty well but still not as well as my former DSCN1.  The handheld shots were a little grainy, but that is to be expected.  Again, my only disappointment was that these pictures were only as good as my previous Sony.  The tripod pictures, of course, turned out much better.  Grain only showed up when I blew the picture up on my laptop.  What turned out to be a nice surprise was that the \"background de-focus\" mode worked in the low light.  BONUS!  I tried every low light setting this camera offered and was pretty pleased... as long as I was using my tripod.  Without it the pictures were not good, but that's my fault not Sony's.  Sony is touting its new Exmor R CMOS sensor pretty hard.  They advertise that it will deliver \"stunning\" low light pictures.  It delivers very good low light pictures but \"stunning\" is pushing it.Battery: So far so good.  When it is fully charged I have no worries that it won't last out what I'm trying to do.  I can't tell you how it runs at \u00bd charge and below because I'm the type of guy that recharges all of my gadgets at night so that I'll be ready to go.  And since you can charge this camera using your laptop with the supplied tiny USB cord, you should be in good shape on the days of heavy shooting.  Just for giggles I did run the power down using the slideshow feature and `Planet Rock' music I downloaded.  It took a little over two hours at \u00be battery power.3-D: I haven't been able to see pictures on a 3-D TV but when you take a 3-D picture with this camera, you CAN see it 3-D.  It's slight but it is there.  You can also see the 3-D picture without the use of those Amish-ugly 3-D glasses.  It's actually pretty cool.Summation: Taken everything into consideration I am happy with this camera so far.  I take it everywhere with me and its small enough to fit in my pants pocket without that embarrassing bulge.  I think this camera will easily fit your needs for a very good P&S; camera and then some.  Yeah, I'll always wish back to the days of the DSCN1, but until someone invents a *working* time machine I'll happily use my new WX9.Pros:* The LCD screen is stunningly gorgeous.  So much so that the pictures look better on my camera than they do on my laptop. (#crappylaptopfail).*  Beautiful camera design.* The video is beautiful.* Image quality***. (see above)* Plenty of shooting modes to choose from.* Very light and a great size to throw in your pocket or purse.* I love how you can switch the corporate elevator music with music of your choice for the slideshow playback.  The only drawback is that you have to use Sony's supplied software on the CD they give you.  Unfortunately it's typical gimmicky photo software that you can EASILY do without.  I installed it just to give it a test run and I'm going to keep it ONLY because I want to use it to switch the music.  Seriously, how cool is it that now I can play `Planet Rock' while showing my pictures?  BONUS!!Cons:* I'm not a big fan of the control wheel.  If you have big fingers I feel bad for you.  Too many times I kept inadvertently kept hitting the button in the middle as I was trying to switch modes.  DSCN1 had a touch screen and why they got rid of that I will NEVER know.* Image quality (I know, I know... how can it be a pro and a con?).  While the image quality is good, I still find myself wishing back to the picture quality of the DSCN1.  The picture aren't *bad* but I expected a lot more after five years of technology between cameras.* While using the video feature you can hear the camera if you use the zoom.* If you have the money, there are better point and shoot cameras that can handle low light photography better.Side Notes:* The battery can be charged via a battery pack plugged into camera and plugged into wall, or USB cord plugged into camera plugged into computer.* I use a Transcend 4GB Class 10 SDHC memory card as my main baby and a Lexar 8GB Class 2 memory card for backup and extra storage.* If you have any other questions please feel free to ask me here or e-mail me at [...] and I'll do my best.* Because someone ALWAYS asks, this camera was not on a strict lay down date and I was able to order it through a camera store in another state (I live in CA).  That's how I got it \"early\".Sony DSCN1 Picture Album - [...]", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for the price", "Author": "Hitman", "ReviewID": "R17VFZXOGNFILZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I currently own a D90 but decided to buy this camera for occasions not convenient to carry a bulky camera.

I have been buying Canon cameras till this point and like them a lot. But, both my Canon point and shoots went bust after 2 - 3 years. So, I decided to move away from Canon and did an extensive research with a capped budget of 200$. I initially set my eyes on Panasonic ZS7 with the Leica lens, the price of that shot up and so I removed it from my list and continued by search. In my initial research I was avoiding Sony as in the past they only took Memory sticks and those were expensive. But, when I found out that this can take both memory stick and SD card, it came in as a strong option.I was looking for a camera with good zoom, decent low light performance (so preferably CMOS), good video, brand lens and recent model as I plan to have it for a few years. Finally toss up was between the Canon ELPH 100 HS and this one. Since, I wanted something other than Canon, I chose this Red one to match the red of my JVC camcorder.So far, I am pretty impressed by the performance of this little one. The menus are neat, the LCD screen is awesome. I have mostly used Intelligent Auto and it works well most of the time. Videos are great and battery life is decent as well. I haven't used 3D (probably would never will) and that was never a factor. Provided companion software is good and does it work without any issues. I just wish the zoom is little more than 5X (10X would have been nice), but you can't have everything at the sub 200 price point.Overall, I would recommend this as a strong buy for anybody looking for a camera in the $200 range.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Battery life??", "Author": "Veric", "ReviewID": "R3E198EI1E2Y3I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Great pictures!

I can't rave enough about the underwater case for the camera. It's a steal for the price! DicaPac WP410 160x105mm Small Zoom Alfa Waterproof Digital Camera Case with Optical Lens (Clear)  With this waterproof case I was able to take a video of the dolphins that kept swimming up to our sea kayak. This camera also takes pictures the same time you are a recording a video.  It took great pictures with whatever conditions. Didn't matter if it was sunny, cloudy, underwater, in the dark didn't matter they always turned out great. It would take pictures in the dark and make them look like they were taken in broad daylight. It has so many nifty features. I haven't been able to try them all out yet though. I especially love the panoramic sweep fixture and it's movie capabilities plus the optical zoom. Buy this wonderful camera the price is unbeatable. My sister just got a $400 Canon camera and I think mine might actually be nicer then hers! I only wish it came in more colors would have loved it in pink.

It is incredibly smart in detecting the kind of focus it needs for every shot and is really amazing, even in low light.

The WX9 has proven me wrong! Below are a few good reasons to buy the WX9:Good Low Light StillsI absolutely love the quality you get in low light. Little to no noise or blurring occurs, even when shooting a dim light source in complete darkness. With just one light on, faces come out crisp and clear (albeit a bit orange). My friend's rival Canon 300 HS couldn't keep up at the restaurant. All his pictures were blurry and grainy. He couldn't believe how clear my photos were. Low light performance is the #1 best thing about this camera!Fast, Accurate FocusingThe focusing on this camera is superb. Unlike older cameras that you needed to tap the shutter button to focus, the WX9 focuses its self (just like cell phones). You always have the option to tap too. In addition to this, it focuses on the right thing quickly. My old Canon IXY took great macro, but often times the focal point would be slightly off. This was a major annoyance that has been alleviated with the WX9.Fast ShootingThis camera shoots as fast as my bulky SLR. No more black screen for two seconds, you see the image after less than a second. Combined with the accurate focusing and quick start-up, it is literally a shoot and go experience. This is very important for a pocket camera. My friend's 300HS did not fare as well. In dark places it took 5 seconds to process. Pretty dismal.DepthI'm not sure if you can count depth as a selling point, but photos shot with this camera (especially macro shots) look extremely rich. My old Canon tended to wash things out for the sake of accuracy, but contrast and color depth are boosted by the camera software, which makes for a much more pleasing photo.MacroI would argue that the macro on this camera is better than Canon compacts. Not only is it more accurate in adjusting it's focal point, it is also WAY more crisp. I will gladly give up 2mm to get the kind of detail you can get from this camera in macro mode.Color and ClarityColors are bright and relatively accurate. I prefer it to the more color accurate Canons, especially since this is a point and shoot pocket camera, I expect the processor and the software to do all the work except composition. Photos are extremely clear and crisp (unless you are shooting a landscape) This camera packs in a lot of detail! It's a lot of fun just taking pictures of things and zooming in.High Quality LCDIf you are thinking about cheaping out here, do yourself a favor and DON'T. This camera is the only compact I have seen so far that has an iPhone quality screen. It is truly worth it, especially since this camera does not have a viewfinder. Playback is truly dazzling and accurate.PanoramaThey FINALLY did it! Sweeping panoramas that work fluidly. Even in a low light situation like a supermarket just turn your body 90 degrees and you get a clear crisp panorama. No blurring, very few staggered points, no waiting for it to process, it's as fast as shooting normally! Shooting in this mode also somehow corrects most of the distortion you normally see in landscape stills. This feature makes AMAZING pictures when you are up high!Here are some reasons NOT to buy this camera:Poor Landscape ShotsPhotos of landscapes, like parks or scenery were miserably blurred and distorted. This probably the worst thing about this camera. Unless you are taking a portrait or focusing on some object in the foreground, you images will be blurred around the edges 75% of the time. Had the camera been more expensive, I would have returned it for this fact alone. Luckily, I don't shoot much besides portraits or of things, so it's not as big a deal for me, but if you area nature photographer it could be a serious issue. My friend's 300HS had similar problems, but not nearly as extreme. Blurring of landscapes on the WX9 is clearly visible, even when the photo is shrunk down. Don't even think about printing landscape photos with this camera.Complicated MenuOperating program mode is a chore, as is selecting other special features like the smile shutter, the manual doesn't help much either, it took a couple of hours for me to figure everything out and I still get mixed up.Few Editing OptionsYou cannot edit things like white balance outside of their pre-adjusted settings, nor can you mess with tone or color balance. I never used these features often on my old Canon IXY, but when I needed them they were extremely useful, and I will miss them.Too Many MegapixelsHey Sony, guess what, I need to store these photos ya know?! Each image is 5-6 megabytes! My old camera was 10 megapixels that clocked in around 1.8-2.5 megabytes. it's manageable, but for a cheaper camera this many megapixels is completely unnecessary and inconvenient.ConclusionIf you can deal with the landscape stills and don't need to many settings, the WX9 is a fantastic point and shoot anywhere camera! It is better than any other compact camera I tried including the Canon 300 HS. There are better small-ish cameras out there like the amazing Nikon 1 NJ1. But at this size and this price point, it is a true bargain camera that takes great shots.

These are the main factors that made me return the wx9.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good, but certainly not the best point and shoot", "Author": "John Diaz", "ReviewID": "R30BBZ0UBFQDJ7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will give a bit of a backstory. I initially bought the Canon Powershot SX230HS but had some buyer's remorse. So, I bought the Sony Cybershot WX9 which was on my short list of competing point and shoot cameras that I was thinking about buying before I bought the Canon. I figured I could return whichever camera I liked less.The fact is, both of these cameras are terrific. You can get the Sony for less than $200 on Amazon and the Canon is around $300. Is the Canon $100+ better than the Sony? No. However, it is a better camera and offers far more possibilities than the Sony. Hey...I am a point and shoot camera user who prefers sticking the camera in auto. That said, the Canon's scene modes are exceptionally easy to use and the 14x zoom is fantastic. In fact I am going to return this Sony Cybershot and keep the Canon because the Canon is simply a better camera. Here is what I found, and I will try to cover as much of the Sony and compare it to the Canon SX230HS whenever I can.LOOKS AND APPEARANCE:The Sony looks very nice. It is so light and small, it is probably smaller than a deck of cards. I really like that the lens is hidden from any surface dirt too. On back, the hi-res 921,000 dot LCD screen is a bright spot. I love that you can shoot an HD movie at the press of a button and do a panorama shot (more on these things later) at a shift of a button. I am not unbelievably crazy about the scroll wheel, but feel it is a vastly overrated complaint from the reviews that I've read. It isn't that big of a deal, but it is certainly a design flaw; Sony could have done so much better. Still, this is easy to get used to. Some of the buttons are a bit too flat with the body and a bit too small. In comparison, I thought that the Canon SX230HS' buttons on back were far easier to press/use and more intuitive. Yes, the Canon is noticeably bigger, but it still falls into the point and shoot class and can fit in a pocket. At the same time, it is functional, and easy to use.PHOTOS:Isn't this the most important part? I thought that in good light, the Sony's pictures were easily as good as the Canon's. I loved the Sony's scene modes. The Sony is perfect for someone who is going to leave the camera mostly in auto, like me, and just wants a really good snapshot. In medium light, again, the Sony was very good and I had very few complaints. The burst shooting mode is also terrific. Low light photos, however, are something else. I tested it at a concert I went to. With the Sony, I would say 75% of the shots came out nicely, but the other 25% were pretty much hideous. I know I shouldn't be expecting beautiful shots, and I'm not. Merely usable shots for Facebook is all I'm hoping for. Those 25% of photos would never be good for Facebook. People's skin had a terrible tone to them. But again, about 75% of the shots came out nicely. Still, the Canon, while it is true that 100% of the shots weren't perfect, it had none of the color issues with low light that the Sony did. Ultimately, I was disappointed with the Sony's low light photos and that single issue convinced me to return the camera and keep the Canon.FEATURES:The 5x zoom is very handy and it is terrific. However, I noticed that at the full length of the zoom, when extended at 5x, the pictures had more issues, especially in low light. The scene modes are very reliable and the auto mode is very, very good.CONCLUSION:I was having trouble pigeon-holing details of this camera into \"Pros\" and \"Cons\" so I scrapped that. All I will say is that I feel I'm being a bit too critical regarding this camera's low light photos. I do think that the camera compensates for color, sometimes good, sometimes bad. The bad parts seem to happen with low light. I wish that this camera had a bit more zoom, but then it probably wouldn't be as compact as it is. While I am not blown out of the water with this camera, it is really, really good. I am having an enormous amount of difficulty trying to choose between this camera and the Canon Powershot SX230HS, so that should tell you how good of a camera it is. If you absolutely do not want any manual controls and a very compact size is important to you, I don't know how you could go wrong with this camera.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not what I expected - but works for my purposes", "Author": "Carrie", "ReviewID": "RQBR0UC00FUWE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I preface my review by saying that I am a very amateur photogragher, but may main camera is a Sony Alpha 350 DSLR, which I absolutely love.  I have gotten amazing photos with it, but it is bulky, so I wanted a small backup for when I didn't want to carry it around.I have had the Sony WX9 for about two weeks and it is okay, but not really what I expected.  I was being loyal to Sony and liked all of the features in the camera.  However, a family member has an old Kodak ultra zoom point and shoot (not sure of the model) that is probably 5 or 6 years old that is just as good and easy to use and it only has 7 MP's.My issues have been included the focus - it is not quick.  If you want to get a quick shot, you need a second or two for the camera to pick up the image.  You can't take them quickly - I guess I am spoiled by the DSLR.  The recovery time after a picture is slower than I expected as well.Also in low light conditions, the pictures I took were so so.  I have to play with it a bit more to probably get the settings right, but it is a point and shoot and it was in the super auto mode - I thought it would adjust the settings for me.This camera was also supposed to be a camera for my husband to use when I had the DSLR, but he complains that all of the buttons and controls are too small - so he won't be using it.  I will probably end up getting him the upgraded Kodak ultra zoom.  I thought about the Sony ultrazoom for me, at first and then for him, but it was too bulky for me and more than I wanted to pay, and after he saw this the WX9 - he doesn't want a Sony - he wants the Kodak.I used the video feature and it was good, that was another reason for the purchase - my DSLR doesn't have video and the Kodak video quality/capacity is not great.  The Sony is much better.At the end of the day - I will use this camera for the purpose that I bought it, but I was a little dissappointed.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  The quality of the pictures when the conditions are right and the camera has focussed is very good, so I will take a lot of pictures and hopefully get the one I want - the beauty of digital!", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "A lot of fluff but image quality not good", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Niko B\"", "ReviewID": "R2JXGJQD2NNT94", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had been drooling over this camera ever since I saw the ads/reviews on youtube. Finally, with not much to do over the Easter weekend, I decided to give it a try. A local store had it in stock for the same price as Amazon so knowing they have a similar return policy, I drove over and bought it. I was excited and expected the camera to really show me something. I was disappointed.The two features that I wanted most were excellent low light performance and the advanced panorama sweep function. I did not care much about the 3D effects or the movie mode but the new 16 mega pixel CMOS sensor and several new software tricks promised amazing low light performance. I set up a test in my living room to compare the WX9 to my other two pocket cams, a Sony H55 and a Casio FC100. With each of the cameras I took several photos of a fairly dark corner of my living room, camera on a tripod and focusing on a shelf of books. To sum up the results, the WX9 got blown away by both of the other cameras. The noise in the WX9 photos was very visible at least twice the noise in the Casio FC100. The Sony H55 show relatively little noise and much, much less noise than either of the other cameras.I examined the EXIF files for the test images and the problem was obvious. The nice noise free image of the H55 shows that it had used an ISO setting of 80 with a shutter speed of 2 seconds. The Casio had moved its ISO setting more to the middle with a setting of 800 with the shutter open for 1/2.5th of a sec. The crazy WX9 EXIF showed an ISO setting of 3200 and an exposure of 1/10th second. I tryed to make this work using the HDR low light setting where several imaged are blended to get a good exposure and supposedly lower noise but got the same noisey results. Finally, I switched to P mode thinking I could force the ISO lower but the WX9 allows only the ISO to be adjusted so exposure and aperture were not available to me .. result ... big time under exposure ( like a black hole).Then I moved outside to test the panorama mode. My other Sony, the H55, also has that feature but not the new version. Again, the H55 beat the WX9 when I straight sweep across a deck with parallel planks, the H55 had no problem and gave me a nice image. The WX9 seemed to be trying to do too much and the planks came out choppy and a bit wavy as though the WX9 was trying to compensate for something that did not exist. In using the WX9 you get the feeling that the electronics are very quick however, the all extra post processing that goes on to accomplish their dog and pony show usually takes several seconds between shots. I made my very average Sony H55 seem pretty snappy. By now, I was very disappointed with the WX9. It was clear that there was little reason to go further with the testing. I did take a couple of ordinary outdoor photos in normal sunlight with the WX9 and they were beautiful so I know the camera can fulfill it primary mission which is the take nice photos but pretty much any camera can do that.So I returned the WX9 with heavy heart but with a lesson learned. I have a near obsession for Sony products but I will take advertising claims for new products with a grain of salt in the future.========== Additional =================While I stand by my claims about the WX9 being not so good for low light ... I don't wish to give the impression that I am down on Sony cameras. I just think they rushed this model out to meet sales deadlines. In fact, having a Sony fetish, I recently (2 weeks ago) bought the Sony's A580 DSLR .. it has pretty much the same features but they are applied to the superior DSLR hardware ... man!!! I want to tell you the A580 is amazing. Beautiful images are in its DNA and the low light performance is at least  10 times better than my previous DSLR could do. I will do a review on that beautiful machine later. Sony still has the best engineers in business and makes the sensors that many of the other brands are using. In most cases, Sony gets it right.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera!!", "Author": "Julia", "ReviewID": "R1ZEJ1P716V4J1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an amazing camera!

Adamson", "ReviewID": "R3A69X2CAAIV37", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my wife as a birthday present. She previously had a Nikon Coolpix that had horrible problems with taking blurry pictures, and the battery compartment cover had broken off just from normal use. I have a Canon DSLR so we also like to have a compact point and shoot for when I don't feel like lugging the Canon around.I decided on the Sony WX9 after reading tons of reviews. Here are some features that we really like on this model after a few weeks of use:*LCD Screen: The LCD Screen is really beautiful. It is higher resolution than a lot of other competitive cameras and pictures and video look great.*Picture Quality: Most of the pictures have come out looking great. We really put this camera to the test by visiting Disneyland where she took about 600 pictures in two days. Photos in well lit outdoor environment look beautiful, with accurate colors and good crispness. Pictures from indoor but well lit environments also look great. We took a bunch of pictures in a restaurant with moderate lighting, and the camera compensates well without getting too grainy. Night shots have come out acceptable. Obviously point-and-shoots aren't going to have fantastic low light performance, but I think this model has probably the best low-light performance that I've seen in similar price range cameras.*iSweep Panorama: This is a great feature starting to pop up on a few cameras. It might be a little gimmicky for more professional photogs, but it has never been easier to make really great panorama shots without having to worry about manual stitching. Just push the shutter, sweep the camera, and you're done. You can take panoramas in landscape or portrait orientation.*1080p Video: The video coming from this camera is really fantastic. It's finally getting to the point where having separate photo and video cameras is no longer necessary for the average consumer. The video quality we got matches our dedicated camcorder purchased only a few years ago. Obviously it doesn't have the feature set and zoom capability of a camcorder, but the image quality is nearly the same.  We bought a 16GB PNY SD card which can hold about 4 hours of HD video. In addition, the image stabilization works great on the video. We used to have a Flip video camera which suffered from horrible shakiness when shooting by hand. The video from the WX9 is silky smooth.*Scene modes: We liked the different scene modes available. The blurred background mode that replicates the depth of field effect you get on a SLR camera worked fairly well and makes for great pictures. There's also a few very specific modes that seem a bit useless including \"Pet Mode\" and \"Food Mode\". We took some pictures of my parents dog with Pet Mode enabled and not enabled, and couldn't tell the difference, so not really sure what the point of it is.*Intelligent Auto: We used this the most because as you're walking around Disneyland taking a ton of photos it's tedious to keep having to change the scene mode. iAuto automatically decides what the best scene mode is (Landscape, Portrait, Backlit, etc.) and adjusts on the fly without you having to worry about it. It displays on the LCD screen which scene mode it's using which is cool as well. 95% of pictures taken using iAuto mode came out beautifully.Things we didn't like:*Battery life:  If you're using all of the features of this camera, especially video recording, the battery will suffer. As I said before the first field test for this camera was 2 days at Disneyland, where we took about 300 pictures per day. The stock battery got extremely low after about 150 pictures and some video recording. Her previous Nikon Coolpix could go a whole day (~300 pictures) on one charge. Luckily we purchased a Wasabi pack which included 2 extra batteries (Highly Recommended, just search for Wasabi batteries matching this model camera -- much cheaper than Sony batteries and last just as long -- also includes extra charger and car adapter).*Camera Interface: We both agree that the user interface for the camera is a little bit clunky. Can't really put a reason on why but navigating the menus just seems a little weird and slow. Not a huge negative, just something we noticed.*Unfortunately we could not sample the 3D capabilities because we do not have a 3D TV.All in all, we are very pleased with this purchase so far.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "pocket perfect", "Author": "SPEEDBOY \"Race Fan\"", "ReviewID": "RHBQXC4AOBIQU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've shot 35mm SLR cameras in the past and it was just such a hassle.  Forget the cost for developing film. Lugging around the extra lenses and related gear was a workout.  I was usually going to races and trudging what seemed like (WAS) miles. Lugging all that gear around was a pain.  Enter the new age of digital.I got this little gem for tucking in my shirt pocket and taking quick snaps and video.  To my amazement the picture quality was good right out of the box.  I can say the same for the video quality.  I'm sure with some experimenting I'll get better with this camera but it's incredibly easy to use.  Folks expecting this thing to perform like an SLR need to get a grip.  This thing is tiny.  Good things come in small packages.  It's good but it's not great unless you're considering the role it plays in one's camera collection.  The snaps and video aren't going to be quite as good as SLRs costing hundreds or thousands more but that's not this camera's function.  It's for tucking in one's pocket and carrying effortlessly.

Dumb proprietary cord.", "Author": "QuoteKeeper", "ReviewID": "R1LWQ2XLQI5Y2P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will focus on one pro and one con.The PROI just returned from a trip to the UK that included many trips in museums, such as the British Museum, Tate, Ashmolean (in Oxford), and various palaces with various indoor sights. One of the selling points of this camera is it's CMOS sensor and reputation for excellent low light performance.  This camera is simply brilliant in lower light. Almost in every occasion, the pictures I took without flash in various indoor settings came out richer, more realistic, and more beautiful than pictures either taken with this camera and flash or my wife's camera and flash (Samsung MV800).  There is a particular setting on this camera called \"superior auto\" (if you have the camera, it's the yellow icon rather than the green, of the first major choices in shooting mode).  I believe it takes a couple of pictures rapidly and averages them to get the best result. Whatever it does, it does it unbelievably well (it's very hard to get good information out of documentation online from SONY.  There is a disk that comes with the camera that must have better information than available anywhere else).  I have so many really amazing shots from the trip of objects and sights indoors using that setting. In many cases, I'd take a shot or two with that setting and then take one with a flash or try other settings. The shots I kept are almost always the ones with the superior auto setting.  This is a true, real strength of this camera.My outdoor pictures with the camera are excellent. But it's nothing to write home about compared to my wife's camera or other camera's I've had there.  It does a fine job but nothing special like with the indoor, non-flash situations.  The little wheel others complain about is, indeed, not well thought out. However, you quickly learn to just use it as a direction/chooser in the menu system and give up on using it as a wheel to turn to get to places.  If you practice (using it as a wheel to turn), you can get the hang of it, but it's frustrating to use than just pressing the menu button and using the wheel for navigation (up, down, select, etc.) and not turning works far better.  You forget soon enough that it can even be used as a wheel.I added a picture taken from within the Eagle and the Child pub in Oxford UK (where CS Lewis and Tolkein met often) to the gallery of photos in the product view above. The room was incredibly dim, and what you can see with the posted photo is just how well the camera can perform in very low light--nothing blurry, but low light of room is accurately captured.  See also the photo I posted of a picture within Christ Church Cathedral, again, without any flash.The CONOkay, stop reading if you really want this camera and you don't mind proprietary cords.  I was so initially frustrated by this feature that I wrote what follows.  It is SO annoying of SONY to do this and it is really the only flaw in an otherwise wonderful experience in getting this camera.So, what's the really dumb thing? The cord you use to charge this camera or transfer pictures from it to your computer (if you do not want to just remove the SD card) is PROPRIETARY. What does that mean? You lose this cord and do not have a spare on a trip and you are done using your camera. You will not find this cord even in specialized camera stores such as where I bought the camera today. More infuriating, you CANNOT buy this cord on Sony's own website as far as I can tell. I've looked through the accessories brochure that comes with camera and I've scoured Sony's website you can buy extra batter, fast battery charge, cables to hook the sucker up to about anything (special HDMI cable, etc.) but you cannot find a Sony OMS charging/picture transfer cord). But the one accessory that is unique and indispensable, you cannot apparently get from Sony.  I might try calling them for fun to see if the service people can find one.You can get that cord (knock offs) from various companies here on Amazon. However, if you read reviews carefully, you'll find unhappy people with Sony cameras who tried various ones and didn't get the right one (and you'll find others who got what they wanted).  If people in those reviews routinely said what model camera they were shopping for and that it worked, it would help a lot. Apparently, what is sold by various aftermarket groups must work for most Sony cameras, but it's still a bit of a crapshoot. Way to go Sony.Sony, of course, has a history of proprietary emphasis in their products (like my awesome Sony MP3 player from Sony requires a very unusual USB connection cord. Hm. Seems familiar, does't it?).  So, you buy a cool Sony electronic device and you'll have to have an extra cord that only works with it and that you may have trouble replacing.Okay, I'm done ranting.

I absolutely love how this feature mimics the background blur that you see in high end SLR cameras. It really makes the subject pop from the background resulting in a subtle 3D-like effect.*Panoramic Mode* - This is also very very cool. Ive never been able to take flawless panoramic pictures so easily before this camera. The camera makes it super easy to take sweeping panoramic shots, and they look amazing. This would be a realtor's dream camera for this reason.*3D Mode* - Being a 3D enthusiast, I wasnt expecting a whole lot out of the 3D pictures, but this little camera produces some pretty strong 3D pictures. We hooked the camera up to my 55\" 3D plasma to check out the 3D pictures we had taken. To my surprise, you can actually navigate your camera with your TV remote control as long as the camera is connected via HDMI. The 3D pictures looked great, definitely exceeded my expectations in this department. Some pictures the 3D was more noticable depending on what you are looking at. I found that 3D pictures of my salt water aquarium look outstanding!*Smile Shutter* - I had never seen this technology before and I was really impressed by it. You dont have to push any buttons whatsoever. You just make sure you are facing the camera, give it a little smile and the camera snaps a picture. There are 3 different settings for smile shutter mode which are represented by icons. Since you cant see the icons, I will describe them as follows:  No-teeth smile, teeth smile, super cheese smile. Works great!*1080p 60 Frames per second video recording* - The video recording is the best I have seen from any point & shoot camera.

Reliably, I kept coming back to the Sony, and User Reviews were a big reason. I also read lots of reviews on Photography websites and consistently the Sony won me over. Importantly, only the Sony has HD AVC 1080/60i video capabilities. The Nikon and Panasonic shoot in MOV 720/24p high definition. The Sony's HD AVC format is preferred as it is very easy to edit. MOV video files are notoriously difficult to work with.

I would still buy this same camera again though! All of the tiny digital cameras have this same issue. I did purchase an accessories kit on Amazon that included an extra battery,another charger that also works in the car,a case,a tiny tripod,a USB unit for downloading on all computers and a 18G memory card! Got all of that for what just the extra battery was going to cost me in our local store!! I can pretty much shoot video and photos for as long as I want where ever I want now!!Short of being a professional photographer I think that this is a perfect camera for pretty much anyone!!

After looking around at a few different cameras, I settled on this one. After taking over 700 pictures with it (within 2 weeks), I can safely say that this camera does everything I could have possibly wanted it to do and more. The biggest highlights for me are the excellent low light performance (I hate using flash because I feel it ruins just about anything buy a portrait), all around great image quality (I would say almost every picture looks good, and those taken in good lighting look spectacular), panoramic mode (you really don't realize how neat this feature is till you try it), and a beautiful display. The 3D feature is also pretty cool to have, but I don't have anything to view those pictures on as of yet (I really wish I could see what they look like). All of my friends are thoroughly impressed by the pictures I take with this, and a few of them own DSLRs (of course the pictures taken on the wx9 aren't as good as a DSLR, but they're amazing for a point and shoot).The only major downside to this camera is battery life. You almost need to buy a spare battery if you plan on having it last the whole day, and if you take any videos on the highest quality those two may not even get you all the way there (The HD video destroys battery life, although the quality is excellent). Aside from that, the only minor frustrations I've run into are that the high resolution panoramic mode is difficult to use (there's a regular mode and a high resolution mode, and while the former works perfectly, the later is really difficult to take pictures on without noticing where the individual photos were merged; although when you do succeed, it looks beautiful), and that it can't really focus on small objects that are far away when you zoom in (though that seems to be a problem with most point and shoots I've tried.I would not hesitate to say that this is one of the best point and shoot cameras you can buy. The only one that's probably better is the Sony dsc-hx9v, but it costs $130 more than the wx9, so for the price this camera really can't be beat.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony Compact camera", "Author": "Lo", "ReviewID": "R2KFYSL0TOGCRJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great pocket camera.

I purchased mine used for $40ish dollars after shipping.  I also own a WX-50, which I purchased for $130ish several months ago.  The WX-9 is every bit as good as the WX-50.  The pictures come out very clear and detailed, the option to charge the battery in the camera is a great bonus, and the Mini-HDMI connector is useful to have.On the downside however, when using Superior Auto mode, the picture processing takes a couple of seconds or so before you can view the picture.  This is noticeably slower than the WX-50.  This is not a big issue for me and what I use the camera for, but it could be for you.  If you are trying to decide between the two cameras, and the prices are similar or identical, I would lean toward the newer model for this reason.  That and the WX-9 still uses the custom USB connector, while the WX-50 uses a standard micro-USB connector for charging and data transfer.The optics and image sensor seem exactly the same, and the quality of the pictures taken are virtually indistinguishable, so if you can get a bargain on a WX-9, go for it.

However my parents were quick learners and I though this Camera would be the best option.Pros._________________________________________________-One of the reasons was that the Sleek Black look of the Sony Cyber Shot gave the camera a very professional look which got my parents excited.-The camera was smaller than I had imagined, was able to fit into most pockets.-5X Digital Zoom was nothing to brag about but the distance sure is nice to have.-16.2 Mega Pixels!! I haven't found any camera with a resolution so precise, my parents were amazed by the clarity.-1080 high definition video was overkill when I took a 5 minute video of my parents, They were astounded by the clarity of the video and were fixated on the video capability.-My parents have always been fans of Sony, however this time the price was too arguably the best for a camera of this high quality resolution.Cons____________________________________________________-There were some cons such as the half metallic/plastic covering of the Cyber shot camera which I though would easily break, since my friend broke his on the 4Th day of trying it and ~tak tak~ the lens stopped working (good thing he has a 1 year warranty).-The battery is really low capacity and needs charging constantly after use. ( I repeatedly had to remind my parents on the phone). Until i Bought them a spare battery in which they could keep switching in case they forgot. (extra battery is $12 at amazon, I had purchased it for 30 at Best buy).*The second con is that the screen is susceptible/prone to smudges w/o a screen protector say goodbye to that high resolution screen. My parents told me the 3rd day that the screen went black and I didn't know the reason ( I am very computer Savvy). In which i found that I had received a defective Sony Cyber shot. Which had lost some trust with Sony and their quality, and so we returned/re-ordered it. No problems as of yet.___________________________________________________+There are many options on this camera for those who love to options such as-1080i movie-Panorama-3D picture- and plenty of Smarty Pic designs such as auto adjust for any type of images such as scenery, close of head shots, or even food which makes you hungry for more.All in All I would recommend this product who are good with tech savvy or able to learn quickly, And make sure its not defective or it will dishearten you from purchasing another camera.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty COOL!!!", "Author": "G.

Was looking at Canon's 300 ELPH model as well. From what I gathered, the 300 ELPH had a lot of problems with the lenses-especially, if they were made in China. I wanted  badly to buy another Canon because I had owned the A570 IS 7.1 MP camera before. Really liked it because it took great pictures. However, it uses AA batteries and was quite bulky to carry around. The 300 ELPH looked like a real winner until I did more research and found out about the lens problems. While reading a review, a reviewer mentioned he had taken the Canon 300 ELPH back and gotten a Sony DSC-WX9. I found that review to be quite helpful. Upon my own further research, I discovered that the WX9 did not have the dreaded lens problems like the 300 ELPH has. But, there were concerns about battery life AND that the controls were too small. That being said, I went to my local BB and seen for myself what the WX9 had to offer me. It is true that the WX9 is very compact but fit well in my hands. Really had no way to test the battery life. So, I went ahead and made my purchase. As a back up plan, I decided to buy a battery charger and (2) extra batteries.Wasabi Power Battery and Charger Kit for Sony NP-BN1, Cyber-shot DSC-T99, DSC-T110, DSC-TX5, DSC-TX7, DSC-TX9, DSC-TX10, DSC-TX100V, DSC-W310, DSC-W320, DSC-W330, DSC-W350, DSC-W360, DSC-W380, DSC-W390, DSC-W510, DSC-W515PS, DSC-W520, DSC-W530, DSC-W550... However, I recently took over 100 indoor shots at a friends birthday party with the flash on auto mode and the camera never once went dead. I did NOT record any video as I bought the WX9 to mainly shoot pictures. I must say, that I am very glad that I did. Yes, the camera is very compact and the controls are small. Over time, I have managed to get use to them. All it takes is a little practice. Small controls were not that big of a deal to ME. Now for others, it could be. In fact, I really like the compactness of the WX9. Most of the pictures I took at the birthday party were very good. Keep in mind, I am still learning how to use the WX9. I am truly an amateur when it comes to picture taking. However, the WX9 makes it easy to do. So far so good. I do think that the WX9 pushes the reds a bit too much, but it is not something that blows the deal so to speak. The color is very good in most of the pics I have taken so far. By that I mean they look natural. Even in low light, the pictures look amazing with great detail. The menu options are laid out very logically. All in all, I love this camera. I highly recommend it.

It plays fine using some player that comes with the camera but I prefer WMP. Installed the codec from here: ac3filterdotnet and now it works fine. That being said there's a couple other audio issues. 1. The zoom motor is quite loud and is caught on video. I guess I can live with it but could definitely do w/o seeing that other cameras and camcorders find a way to mute it or minimize the noise. 2. For some reason there is this stupid electronic chirping sound when taking video in quiet surroundings. Here is an example: [...]- Listen from about 5 seconds into the video and on. This is not my video so seems to affect this model, not sure if it's present in all but at least there are a few out there. I've seen a few samples on youtube from different owners and same weird sound. I don't see any firmware updates to address this and I called Sony and they are not aware of this issue and were not able to fix it. Only way is by sending it in which I hate to do because means I have to be w/o it for maybe a month. If it didn't have this issue, definitely higher rating, just seems like a firmware update could fix it, if so, hopefully soon. Based on this I can't recommend this camera. I checked samples of the next level up the WX10, this issues doesn't seem to be present. Very disappointed that Sony allowed this to slip, I've never seen anything like this even on a lesser brand. I haven't used it long enough to judge battery life but I always carry 2 for any digital imaging device I have anyways.

You can capture either 2 shots per second, or up to 10 shots per second. In viewing mode, you can twist the camera left and right to \"animate\" what you just captured. Neat little feature.- The design is generally good, It's easy to change from picture, video, or panoramic mode. The back of the camera has a glossy finish and the screen is big and looks beautiful when lit.- Video recording is amazing. I've been able to capture very clear videos. I've used this camera to film in court and every time the video quality is top notch. However, note that for the highest resolution, you can only burn those video to Blu ray.- Very easy to mount on a tripod. I've used this camera many times with my Sunpak 620-520D 52-Inch Lightweight Tripod- The battery/memory compartment is easy to open and has a lock.The not so good, but are tolerable:- The wheel for the picture modes isn't as user friendly. Essentially, you spin it with your thumb, but it's easy to accidentally press down.  It can be difficult to switch between modes, but it just takes a little getting used to.- At the highest zoom (5x),I notice some deterioration of picture quality.

I did a fair bit of research trying to find a camera within my budget (under $200) and wasn't even planning to look at the Sony Cybershot line (my previous Cybershot frustrated me to no end) until I noticed the f/2.6 on this camera!Likes:The outdoor/nature photos are superb. (I'll upload a couple.) Indoor in most lighting is great. Panorama is a really neat function. The food scene!Dislikes:Low light photos...are slacking a bit. But maybe I just have yet to figure out the right settings (iAuto does not do a good job.)I have noticed that the WX9 sometimes does not focus on faces in the iAuto mode. there is not a portrait scene to correct this mistake, either.It takes a few seconds for the camera to start recording video after hitting the record button.The scene selection mode is not as extensive as my previous Lumix camera.I've only had the camera for about a month, but so far, I'm impressed, and I've even managed to convert one of my friends to a Cybershot user!", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "excellent point and shoot", "Author": "chaka kahn \"iheartkennywinker\"", "ReviewID": "R2H5H4XMLSQ6E7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched this thoroughly because I consider this a major purchase.

The little camera shot 1080i video, great quality. It comes with many shooting modes. Picture quality is good, the viewfinder is gorgeous. Shoots o.k. in low light.  There are a couple of things I would change if I were a camera engineer at Sony. Some of the buttons are recessed which makes pressing them difficult-including the on/off switch. The file/storage button is the same, most others have elevated surfaces. Battery life is not great-the large LCD screen consumes power. A power-saving screen might extend battery life. I can't download my videos onto my destop computer (a PC) or my daughter's MAC. It would be nice if Sony created the video in a more universal format-MP4 or Quicktime maybe. Sony included some proprietary software to dowload onto the computer for picture storage-I've removed mine. You can open the picture files by just waiting for the Microsoft prompt. Store them on your hard drive, thumb drive, or CD/DVD.Evidently Sony feels they can afford to include an instuction manual with the camera-yes you get a basic manual-but a full one would be nice-c'mon people it's just paper!Would I buy this camera again?

It was one of several cameras I purchased to evaluate prior to deciding on a replacement camera for work. The camera is compact and easy to hold and the screen is fantastic, with extremely high resolution. While this screen is nice it has so much resolution that your pictures actually look better on the camera then when looking at them on a computer monitor. The construction was solid but not solid enough for my taste.  It is mainly plastic and the front panel (a thin metal cap) was actually separating a little on the upper left corner right out of the box.  The pictures when viewed on a monitor did not satisfy me in terms of quality. There was a lot of noise suppression and the images lacked \"real\" detail to my eyes.  Contrast was very high by default(some people prefer this I do not).  The HD video was nice but I needed good pictures over HD video so it was not a factor for me.  Battery life seemed extremely short, with the battery losing all charge after less than 120 pictures of around the house testing. I also did not like the fact that you had to plug the battery charging cord into the camera itself and charge the battery in the camera. I prefer charging the battery in a wall charger since I often buy spare batteries for the cameras I use.Overall, I was not pleased with this camera and chose to return it. It may be perfectly fine for some but the combination of questionable build, less than stellar picture quality, and poor battery life did not appeal to me so back it went.  The camera chosen as it's replacement was a Canon Elph 300hs, which I believe to be a better unit than this one.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Alexandr Zastanceanu \"Zealot\"", "ReviewID": "R8RUGMQUJB9K4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 5th camera- It's a great device with many usefull functions, great picture quality and with a good SD card takes pictures with  verry low dellay before the next shot .

Its no wonder they are losing market share like crazy in consumer electronics.I own two perfectly worthless DX9 cameras because Sony will not own up to design defects in the camera.If this camera hits the ground from anywhere above six inches, the LCD screen will crack internally (the glass will be fine) making the camera worthless and SONY WILL NOT REMEDY ANY PHYSICAL DAMAGE REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT POOR DESIGN ENABLES THIS.I have owned Nikons and Canon cameras for years and I bought two of these cameras. Boy what a mistake. I even own a Nikon FM from 1976 that is in perfect working order -- that is how careful I am with cameras!!!The first DX9 one I bought was based on a food reviewer saying that it does a great job with food shots. It was reasonably-enough priced and bought it from Amazon and started using it.Until I dropped it from a chair (less than 2 foot drop) onto a carpet. The camera was off at the time and it looked fine because the LCD glass did not crack.But as soon as I turned it on, it was obvious that the internal glass had cracked rendering the camera useless.I assumed that this was a fluke, having numerous cameras and Iphones (4 in my house) with never a screen breaking or rendering the phone or camera inoperable.So, I bought another one and within two weeks, this one fell out of my pocket, and again, no damage on the outside, but a useless camera because of a cracked LCD screen.The worst has been Sony. Two cameras in less than 30 days and Sony refuses to repair either one of the cameras.POOR DESIGNBecause the screen goes all the way to 3 edges of the camera, any impact to any of those 3 edges will result in the LCD screen cracking internally.Any other well made product has a rim protecting the LCD edges from collecting direct impact.VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICESony will not warranty any damage to the camera. They will not provide discount repairs. They will not swap out the camera. So whatever you do, buy another camera.I will never buy another Sony product again.The design is poor.

The Sony Cybershot DSC-WX9 is a great camera to go with for the money.  Why?  Any camera can take a picture of something not moving in bright light.  The true test of a camera is where it's being pushed to its limits:  low light and when something is moving.  This is because light is information to a camera.  Cameras generally have three ways to deal with this, for motion it's to take a quicker picture.  For low light the camera makes its iris through the lens of the camera larger (this is called an aperture).  Finally in general is sensor size:  the larger the sensor, the more light it picks up.So why is this important?  If your camera cannot pull these situations off, you are left with dark pictures or really blurry pictures.  Lots of cameras have things like a big display and image stabilization, so what makes the Sony different?For motion, the camera optimizes shots with superior auto mode.  This function actually takes more time to take a picture but automatically optimizes scenes.  If you don't know how to work your camera's settings and just to press that shutter to get a picture, this will help you take better photos.For low light, there is the iris (aperture) and the sensor.  The sensor is on the high side of compact cameras and the aperture is fairly large (sensor is 1/2.3 and the largest aperture is 2.6)The only thing that I would add onto this camera is more than a 5x zoom.  All in all, the DSC-WX9 is a great camera.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera, especially for a novice", "Author": "GEA", "ReviewID": "RTVUU2LXHPSYM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has been an outsanding camera for us.

In terms of video quality with a 32gb on the lowest setting I can get anywhere from about 18 hrs of video. While If i record in 1080 I get anywhere from 1-2 hrs.

I'm guessing like most, once you find a camera manufacturer and get used to their settings and operation, it is easier to stick with them rather than reading yet another manual. The great thing for me is that once I got hooked on the Sony cameras I was all set because, for the most part, they do take excellent pictures. I have very little interest in the video aspect of this camera so I won't mention it further. I'm totally into still photos and have received many, many compliments on the pictures taken from our travels but credit this 100% to the camera as I have zero training.So if you are like me and you get easily bored with manuals but really want to take high quality shots to hang on your walls or throw in a book, I recommend you try Sony and see what you think. I have also used some Canon and Nikon models but I am sticking with Sony. As for the DSC-WX9, I bought it specifically for a trip to Central America as I didn't want to bring the whole camera bag with me for security reasons (and to pack light for the in-country flights). This camera is compact enough to fit in your pocket and is an easy little point and shoot. I've had excellent luck in lower light situations which can be the achilles tendon of many an amateur and produced some all around excellent photos. My only issue with this camera which isn't even enough to drop it a star is that it's not the quickest to focus and shoot. It's just something you get used to and we're only talking fractions of seconds. Otherwise, for me, it's a typical Sony - easy to use and produces beautiful photos. If you take into account the quality and features along with the price, this little camera would be hard to beat.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful pictures!", "Author": "F Rector 3", "ReviewID": "R2IT2KHB6M26QW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second Sony Camera.

If your a PC user and never plan on switching this obviously isn't a problem you'll run into. I'm a Apple fankid for sure & I really did like this camera so im pretty disappointed.

If you want to take pictures of fast-moving children I don't think you'd miss a shot...I've owned over 20 digital cameras the last 8 years, and this Sony has the fastest shutter response time of them all.  I was amazed.  The battery lasts a long time.  The HD video quality is awesome, too.Why I returned it:I wanted this camera solely for the background defocus feature; I believe Sony is the only manufacturer that offers this on some of its higher-end point & shoot cameras.  It's a wonderful idea, but rarely worked.  For best results, it could only be used outdoors as the flash is automatically disabled when this is chosen, and then the subject that is being focused has to be 30 cm (almost 1 foot) from the camera for the camera's software to apply the defocus to the background.  75% of the time it did not work, at least it tells you on the screen after you take the picture, so you can try again.My other objective was to take decent pet photos.  I first tried the Scene Mode specifically for Pets.  When those turned out bad, I tried the other settings such as Intelligent Auto and Superior Auto. Nothing was sharp enough, and my post-processing software couldn't do enough to combat the softness of the photo either.  Superior Auto had the best shots of all, but still not as good as I currently get from my 3 year old Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ8.One feature I don't like is the Mode Dial.  I'm not sure if all Sony cameras have this but if you aren't careful while dialing it up or down and your finger puts too much pressure on any north/south/east/west point on the dial, you can easily change the flash settings by accident, as well as other things.On the plus side, this camera is made in China, but has a good build quality, and even the battery/memory card door is substantial, the zoom motor sounds robust, and the over 900,000+ pixels on the LCD screen - phenomenal!", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Calificacion", "Author": "Jose Luis", "ReviewID": "ROX9667CHV5KR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Es un vendedor responsable se los recomiendo ya que cumple con las expectativas de un buen proveedor lo que habla mucho de su persona", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Does an OK job, but could be better", "Author": "boohoo", "ReviewID": "R27PWC10DULMZX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera does a good job in good lighting.

I found it to be a great camera to put in your pocket and go where ever, when ever. I enjoy photography and always have a camera available. But I do a good deal of video as well. All of it in the AVCH formate of hi - def. The only draw backI found with the WX1 was the lack of AVCH video. Editing video was a bit more involved blending MPeg4 and AVCH. So when Sony introduced the WX9 I bought one.To date despite the few negitives I found written here it's a great camera for both video and still photography. The still photos are supurb at 16meg a pixels. I don't understand comments by some of poor photographs. Mine are perfect! Plus the advanced auto mode results in another option, in additon to the many manual settings available to the photographer.The flash is on the weak side, but let's face it, if you want to shoot somehthing requiring a flash and your beyond 12 feet, a pocket camera won't do it. But on the other hand, the WX's low light capability is excellent, even w/o a tripod. In the low light mode the camera will take multiple pictures and put them together to make a picture. All of this happens in an instant!The zoom lens is only 5 power. But I'll wager that will get you by at least 80% of the time.Then their is the video! Really great hi-def video at the 1080i level. Plus you get the major benefit of optical image stablization for smooth, steady video. I need to point out here - the system in the WX9 is among the best out in the consumer level cameras. So if you tend to be a little shaky when shooting video, this camera will help you.The only reason I gave the cmaera 4 stars in stead of 5 is the use of \"slide switches on the back of the camera, and the very small on/off switch on the top of the camera. Sony could have put the standard rotary switch in place of one of the slide switches. This must have been an issue of cost, and perhaps space limitations. Rotary switches tend in my opinion to last longer.All in all it's still a great camera - one that you will not be dissapointed owning.

The USB cable is non-standard AND the cable is not generally available for sale. This means that if you lose the included cable, you are screwed, because you have to contact Sony Parts to try to get a new one.

The camera was a Christmas gift for my wife who is mainly a full auto photographer and on paper it met all our needs; great pictures and videos according to many website reviews as well as the reviews on Amazon.The problem I have with the camera is the over saturated and over exposed indoor still pictures.  While I was able to get some descent pictures using various settings, it seems the camera is prone to producing very over exposed pictures in low light situations when the flash is used.  The pictures came out very bright and washed out looking.  Outdoor pictures produced very good detail and rendered the colors more accurately but still slightly strong in the reds and blues.While the still images were questionable, I thought the camera excelled with its outstanding video capabilities.  The videos were very impressive in low light and normal lighting conditions.Also, as others have pointed out, the battery doesn't last long.

BUT, turns out any negatives I read were not deal breakers, or I didn't even notice at all. For instance, several reviewers commented on over-saturation of colors. True. But wow, they pop nicely, especially in low light. I took some test shots of our Christmas tree and outside lights, and they're beautiful! Low light performance in general is just amazing (best at the widest angle, no zoom.. zoom does evil things to the low light handling and picture quality, and if this were a DSLR or more expensive camera in general I might bitch :)). Low light photos rock. Color saturation? Meh. Looks terrific to me. Put em both together. Terrific.I also read that some folks thought the battery life sucked, while others thought it was great. Go figure. I bought a second battery, really cheap right here on Amazon, plus a charger for good measure, just in case. I don't expect the world from a thin little sliver of Lithium ion battery anyway, long as I can snap a bunch of pic before I change it out. From my brief testing so far, it looks like the battery will hold up just fine.Okay, shooting modes. Lots of em. Haven't checked out but a few, like background defocus, panorama, intelligent auto, and superior auto. Nice, and all those have worked well in low light too. Movies? played back my cat on HDTV (also in low light btw). Perfect.Some folks carry on about having to buy a memory card. Get over it. Most of these camera's require that, and this one accepts the Sony memory sticks AND SD cards, up to 32MB. Got a Sandisk 8GB class 10 for mine, and I can snap away freely. I figured, why get the minimum requirement for the device? Faster is better, that way I know how well the camera can perform. You can get a LOT of shots on an 8GB card too. If you really need to carry around a thousand shots of your treasured memories without downloading them to your computer once on a while, get a bigger card.Some wit declared that his camera had a plastic tripod mount on the bottom, couldn't believe it was so cheap. Not. Black metal. Duh. Controls too small? Small yes, not unmanageable. That little wheel is a bit tricky, ok, but not horrible. Battery and SD card fit snugly inside a well-designed door that is spring-released and closes securely. Someone complained that the USB port is on the bottom and they couldn't sit the camera upright while downloading photos. Why on earth would you want to? OH, the HDMI cable I got with my Canon camcorder works perfectly with this! Cool, I thought I'd have to buy Sony's, but I don't :)Is this the be-all-end-all Point & Shoot camera that you can buy for less than $200 that will do everything a DSLR does (providing you know how to use the darn thing)? I would personally like to smack anyone who thinks it should be. Get a grip. This is a darn nice camera, and I really like it!

It takes really great photos under good lighting and I absolutely love the option to take photos while recording simultaneously!  Here's a quick pros and cons list:Pros:- Soft Snap is my favorite setting.  It's crisp and makes everyone in the picture look clean and fresh (as if they were wearing makeup!)- Options are easy to find.  The camera overall is very easy to use- It's small and light!  Doesn't feel bulky and has a sleek design.- Gourmet setting is excellent for detailed close-up shots!- Non-flash mode under good lighting creates some fantastic photos!  But you need to have good lighting...- Capture photos while taking videos (AWESOME!!)Cons:- There's a lag when switching from video to photo mode.  Sometimes, it could take several seconds before the camera is ready to take a photo (annoying)- Lag before and after I've taken a photo (will switch to view mode randomly and I have to manually exit out of it.. wth)- Slow to turn off and on (lag, yet again.)- Low light setting is not that great.  Need everyone to stand completely still in order to get a decent shot.  The flash setting is harsh (I generally hate flash mode)- Photos while taking a video are of lower quality- Transferring photos to computer is such a hassle... even after I've deleted it from the SD card, it somehow still remains in my camera and I have to manually delete them.  Very annoying...I'm content for the time being.. the camera gets the job done and seems to be working fine.

Unfortunately, once I turned it on I saw that the internal LCD screen was cracked. I didn't think much of it, thinking that the camera must've been dropped badly in my absence and that it's my own fault for having forgotten it. Since I was happy with the picture quality and only owned the camera for about 3 months at this point (so no newer models have come out), I went back to the store and bought a second one.Now fast forward 3 more months and I was in a lounge with some friends, and the camera fell out of my purse, which was placed on a LOW LOUNGE CHAIR, no more than a foot off the ground. It was really a very short distance to fall, and there was a carpet on the floor. I immediately picked it up and to my great surprise discovered that the internal LCD screen was cracked again, rendering it unusable! This time I was there to witness the fall, and I have to tell you- having dropped multiple phones in the past and having owned the previous model of Sony Cyber Shot for over 4 years- that camera should not have been broken after that fall.I am very disappointed. I was pleased with the picture quality, but I really don't expect my cameras to break quite as easily as that.

It is razor sharp, and when you play the images back on the camera, it shows you the image exactly as it was captured. On many cameras the images look good on the camera's LCD but looks blurry or dark on the computer screen, not with this usefully sharp LCD. Just the amazing LCD by itself makes the camera worth it.-Excellent images - Constantly razor-sharp, clean, detailed, and vibrant. Not so soft like Canon. It is a commendable performer in low-light situations and nights shots taken in twilight hand held mode looks awesome.-Stunning video: HD movies look stunning and spectacular with awesome, clear stereo! I made video of a beach on a sunny day with camera on tripod, played on 60\" TV. Everyone thought it was recorded with some $3000 JVC professional video camera.-Boxy, slab sided body: easily sits upright and looks professional.-Plastic battery cover: finally a battery cover that feels sturdy! It closes smoothly and effortlessly with assurance and good tactile sensation. Also while it's open, the power stays on so you can switch the memory card without interruption. On the Canon 300HS, the power will shut off if you open the cover.-FLASH times are surprisingly quick.WHAT'S NOT:-Images are a bit noisy at upper ISO. However software will do an amazing job of cleaning them up and enhancing the image, some are free like NeatImage.-Buttons tiny and slow.-Battery life improved over previous W series but still a little short. 2nd battery is recommended-Charging time is annoyingly long. Quick charger is available but it's over priced up the ass like all Sony accessories.-Sony is no longer including an AC brick charger for the battery, which means the battery has to be charged while it's inside the camera, which is annoying.

It does have the annoying habit of turning itself on, due to a lack of lock power on button arrangement.When it turns on on your pocket, the lens tries to come out. The lens jams. You now have some $300 worth of junk camera.What's to like about that?Addition: I've got about 2 hours in disassembling the camera by intuition with hhopes of unjamming it.

The web site is a mess - circular - and the folks in India who answer the phones don't know what SONY is.... or, its products are - nor, do they really care if they help you at all.  So, when you look at this camera - you may consider a different manufacturer.  One that has its act together.AMAZON follows this up with an equally interesting sales pitch when I asked about accessories.  The older Cybershot and the newer Cybershot take all new accessories...  batteries - adapters etc.  Another negative on SONY.  AMAZON says - if it isn't sold as a package - \"go to[...] - there you will be able to find information [and purchase] accessories\" for the newer Cybershot.WOW!Nice job SONY and AMAZON.
