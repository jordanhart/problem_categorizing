{"Reviews": [{"Title": "BEST little camera", "Author": "jjrose", "ReviewID": "R2E1SQE2HSGBHM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't know how great this little camera was until it was stolen and I tried replacing it.  I got a $65 Fuji sale and couldn't stand it (Maybe they make a better one) - but my i1236 was purchased for about $50.  I got a Casio and that didn't come close either.  Now I find I can replace my Polaroid and am pushing myself to spend the $130 just to get one before they're gone.  It's great in every way - there are many pros and not a single con.  Pro - easy to follow instructions; classy layout in the menus - the Fuji felt cheap and sometimes like a toy... This Polaroid gives great clarity in the zoom - even those enlarge very well.  I must admit the Casio was 2nd-hand but still I thought my photos with the i1236 were so much sharper...that if that Casio worked at all it should have shot a better pic than that one I got - it seemed short on pixels when enlarging.  I shouldn't even write such a glowing review; they may be gone by the time I scrape up the $125 or $130.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003T2MF18"}}
