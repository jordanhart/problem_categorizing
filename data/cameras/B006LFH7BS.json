I received mine, and had problems with two of the cameras.  The cameras simply kept giving a jumpy picture, decided to return the product.  If all of the cameras would have worked, probably would have kept the system.  The two cameras that did work, gave a good picture.  The system is not completely wireless, you have to plug in the cameras, and then connect the receiver to your TV/Computer, still some wiring involved.  Make sure you have outlets close to where you want to install the cameras, because they will need to be plugged.

Range isn't great. In fact it has to be tweaked some. It is usually line of sight meaning the receiver has to be in a non obstructed view. It will not go through thick walls. Meaning you can't be on the third floor of the house with the camera in the basement. It is well worth the asking price. The best part is its wireless. Have you even considered drilling holes in you're ceiling and walls and running 100 Feet of cable through them for these other systems that are not wireless? Wireless is the way to go if you are thinking about a system for you're house. What if you rent a house or apt. you think the landlord will like holes drilled in his residence? Probably not.", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "wrost camera i have ever bought", "Author": "Zishan", "ReviewID": "R1IBRC9H5Z3ZM1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "doesn't have good reception or quality..no clear picture as well as hard to download on the computer and if you disconnect it or try to make any changes you have to start all the way from Zero again..", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Jumpy picture", "Author": "Elliott Blackwelder", "ReviewID": "R2MB3VU1L28I27", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Picture is very jumpy.
