If you are looking for something better than a kids camera this one is good, at 3MP I've gotten some sharp photos.  It comes with a built in flash if you want to use it, and many settings to explore for different lighting and such.  I recieved mine without its manual or drivers, yet had no trouble moving photos to my computer.  If you want to use it like a web camera you need the drivers. Look under DSC (digital slim camera) -Not DXG off the DXGusa.com website to get them free.Now for the bad, when taking photos the camera makes you wait 10 sec between shots.  Also its own memory is not very big so if you use the highest settings I recomend getting a memory card (it won't take a card more than 512mb) and lastly heavy use does eat batteries quickly, so if you are using it for something important, carry a few extra AAA's.I've found it still takes exellent pictures even at the lower settings, provided you have a steady hand and for the price (under $20) I'm happy owning this camera.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0002DUURI"}}
