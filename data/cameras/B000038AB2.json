{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Color and Detail", "Author": "James L. Wilson \"wilson99\"", "ReviewID": "R1PHEUOBVS5JV4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a photographic and computer enthusiast and having these two elements come together is a delight for me. So, I have all the very expensive stuff, including KODAK's $20m commercial digital cameras. So, I know what quality  is and how much it costs. Bottom-Line as starters, the DC280 makes great  color shots with very suprising Hi-detail. The Advertisments say  \"good\" for 8x10 photos, however, as a very picky guy, when you  get past 5x7 print sizes, the pictures start to turn fuzzy. But the 5x7  prints are shockingly clear with brilliant colors. But, so what, how many  prints does one make larger than 5x7 anyway. This camera is easy to use  & small, and I carry it on vacation locations, when I don't want to  carry my larger and heavier commercial camera. I was truly shocked at the  excellent picture quality of the 280. ALSO, KODAK includes great software,  so after a picture taking day/nite, one can easily connect to the yellow  video plug on your TV (or Hotel TV) for a slide show of the days  activities. I would recommend purchasing a 64MB memory card with the camera  purchase, so you'll get plenty of picture opportunities (75+ shots) without  having to worry about using up memory. In other words, since you can erase  shots you don't like, take MANY, MANY shots and pick the best ones you like  for printing or e-mailing. I bring my laptop with me on trips, so in the  evening, I can copy the photo-files to the hard disk, and erase the camera  memory card, in preparation for the next days photo activities. KODAK  provides serial, USB cables, and software to accomplish this simply.  Definitely do NOT buy a digital camera with less than 2,000,000 pixels.  (The older models, presently having good sale prices, are technology of 2/3  years ago, and you'll wish you spent the extra money for this camera).  Since KODAK has been the color business for 100 years, (well...50+years)  its no surprise that they have created an electronic imager (the CCD Chip)  with the BEST Color quality and detail. This is a must have, you'll not be  dissappointed. If you have another few hundred dollars, check out the SONY  or OLYMPUS dye-sublimation printers, which produce actual photo quality  continuous tone prints up to 4x5 sizes; These printers are not dot-matrix's  with all the little dots. The camera and the printer makes for a great  combo family gift for under $2m, that anyone in the family can use without  having to even turn on a computer, as the printer prints directly off the  camera memory card. SO that you don't make yourself craze, and since its  slightly different than a typical film point and shoot camera, be sure to  read the instruciton booklet, before pushing all the buttons. The  documentation KODAK gives you is very easy to understand, so take it slow  when you open the Box for the first time. It's so intuitive to use, after  the first 2 outings, you NOT need to keep going back to the booklets.

I have had mine for a couple of months now, and it has literaly replaced my regular 35 mm camera.  I love the convience of taking pictures  then making any edits i need from my computer.  The software is easy to  install, and only has about a one hour learning curve to master.  Very good  and fast usb connection.  With a fully charged set of NI-MH, AA batteries  it gets fantastic long life.  And the 2.0 Megapixel image is nothing less  than photo film perfect, must be seen to belive.  I also like the smart  card memory media included, I have upgraded the 8 mb, to a 24 mb card, and  on the 24 mb, I can snap over 100 photos in the best quality mode on the  lower size setting, and 34 of the highest quality photos in the huge mega  resolution setting.  Another great feature is that this camera is very easy  to use compared to the other brands I have tried.  I did not even have to  read the instructions,  (though I would read them if I were a beginer).  Try the Kodak DC280 out if your in the market for a fantastic digital  camera!", "Date": "June 26, 2000"}, {"Title": "Better than I expected!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R226K61WJPEXOJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall, this is an excellent camera and I've had nothing but great luck with it.  The pictures are terrific.I had heard a lot about the DC280  and similar digital cameras chewing up batteries, so I bought an extra set  of rechargable NiMH batteries -- in addition to the set that comes with the  camera.  While this is still a good idea, I didn't find that the battery  life was particularly bad.  On a recent trip overseas, I shot over 150  pictures (many with flash) and still had good battery life when I got home  -- enough for another 75 pictures.  Just don't use the LCD preview screen  for every shot -- that's not what it's intended for, and it WILL kill your  batteries pretty quickly.The real limitation is the Compact Flash  memory.  If you shoot the highest resolution possible, the camera will fill  a 8mb card (which is what is supplied) with only 9-12 pictures.  I  typically get 32 hi-res pictures from a 16mb card.  (The number of pictures  you get will vary depending on the complexity of the images you shoot.)  So, in addition to an extra set of rechargable batteries, think about  buying the highest capacity Compact Flash card you can afford!If you're  thinking about getting a higher resolution camera than the DC280, keep in  mind that you'll get even fewer pictures per megabyte on your Compact Flash  cards.  Personally, I found enlargements up to 5x7 printed by Ofoto nearly  impossible to tell from film pictures.  I'd only recommend a 3 megapixel  camera if you intend to print 8x10s regularly.A USB Compact Flash card  reader is a great option, too.  It saves the camera battery and allows you  to quickly download your pictures without tying up the camera.", "Date": "July 26, 2000"}, {"Title": "Great for Web images", "Author": "John Harris Stevenson \"tranquileye\"", "ReviewID": "R274RKHULC4IZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although it sometimes feels like we're all still beta testing various digital imaging technologies, including digital cameras, products like the Kodak DC280 make me believe the \"dark ages\" might be coming to an  end.This is a good mid-range digital camera, perfect for those who want  to capture images that will look very good on the Web. The biggest plus of  the camera is image quality; this is the best camera in this price range  that I tested, with two-megapixel resolution. Having quite a bit of  hands-on experience with various Sony cameras, I and my partner were  actually stunned by how clear the DC280's images were in a variety of  lighting conditions.There is very little to complain about in terms of  interface and usability. I scanned the manual, and then just started using  the DC280. The menu system and buttons are quite intuitive. One minor  quibble is that one is pretty much forced to use the DC280's viewfinder  left-eyed; otherwise the LCD screen smudge factor so common to digital  camera will rear its ugly head. However, I use the LCD for the majority of  my shooting, so this isn't a huge factor.The DC280 uses a USB connection  to transfer images to your computer. The camera mounts as if it were a hard  drive, and one can preview large thumbnails of images before copying them  over to your hard drive. While I was able to open the images directly into  Photoshop, Fireworks couldn't get into the camera; this may have been a  problem with how I have my file associations set up, however.The camera  comes with a number of features and extras. The bundled software, Adobe's  PhotoDeluxe and Pagemill, are more than adequate for editing images and  creating Web pages. Various simple visual effects and borders can be  applied in-camera, and you can run a slide-show right out of the camera  using the supplied video cable.The DC280 includes four rechargeable AA  batteries, a recharger, and four AA alkaline batteries. You can get started  right out of the box. My camera sucked the alkalines dry after about 50  photos and a couple of downloads; I would suggest buying an extra set of  rechargeables to carry around with you, and an AC adaptor.This is not  the perfect camera for all applications. For one thing, there are few  manual controls on the camera for focus, aperture or shutter priority, and  the optical zoom limited to 2X.  This will mean that photo enthusiasts  might want to look at something the next step up, such as the wacky-looking  Nikon Coolpix 950. As others have reported, low-light shooting is not at  the quality that one would hope for from a camera at this level.All-in-all, the DC280 is an excellent camera for the price, perfect for  Web photos.", "Date": "May 17, 2000"}, {"Title": "An excellent buy!", "Author": "A User", "ReviewID": "R2TXQIYQ0U6EPK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With this camera, you will get great colors on your screen.  I tryed the same picture with the three different qualities and with all I got excellent pictures.  It has all the basic features you might need in any camera.  It has a good zoom, the 'physical zoom' is not that good, then I discovered the digital zoom which is great.It consumes a lot of batteries, but you have more than enough with the rechargable batteries and of course, the battery charger included in the camera.  I bought an additional charger because I never found that the camera came with its own,  so don't buy another charger.I'm more than satisfied with the 8MB flash card.  It is true that you can only take 12 pictures with the highest resolution (1800x1600) and higest quality, but with standard resolution(800x600) and the medium quality you still have very good pictures and can get about 52 pictures, which is good for a weekend.  If you have a long trip and don't have a pc to download the pictures, then you might consider another flash card.BAD THINGS:  It weights a little bit more than a traditional camera of the same size, but still, it's much better that other big cameras. It doesn't come with a camera bag.  You have to buy it appart.In summary,  a great camera.", "Date": "October 10, 2000"}, {"Title": "Excellent, all-around - but tough for action shots", "Author": "A. Switzer", "ReviewID": "RZNQ2D914YXT5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I finally upgraded from my original 2 year old Digital Camera - a Casio 5000SX that was great except for a poorly designed battery door. The Kodak DC280 Zoom is better in every category - clarity, features, memory capability, analog zoom, except for one - the delay in the time from pressing the shutter until it snaps the picture. Keep in mind, that the processing time is quite fast - the Kodak is ready to take your next picture quite quickly, thanks to some in-memory processing, but the delay from when you click the button until the action is captured is quite lengthy. I find it nearly impossible to get good action shots with this camera. For example, I take quite a few pictures of sand volleyball on my weekends. Only the highest flyers - the guys that can jump out of the sand and hang like Vince Carter were captured in the air, and only with me clicking the shutter button at least 2-3 seconds *before* they jumped. However, if you don't have to take a lot of action shots, well this this is an excellent camera for the money - for both amateur and professional alike.", "Date": "September 26, 2000"}, {"Title": "HAPPY WITH MY CHOICE", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1WLE8LFA8A68K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I too read reviews, searched the web,compared features, and priced the various models.

I know there are other cameras with better color, but no zoom, or better zoom, but costs more, or......etc.  The plus factors are..... EASE OF USE, NON-COMPLICATED, GREAT CUSTOMER SUPPORT, GREAT WARRANTY, AND GREAT PRICE, GREAT ACCESSORY PRODUCTS AVAILABLE.  Negative factors.....lens cover could be a better fit & quality, and LCD display seems to get smugged easily....... I DO SUGGEST THAT YOU CONSIDER PURCHASING THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS: 1. KODAK CAMERA CASE ( I got mine for $17.00 ) 2. BATTERY RE-CHARGER 3. EXTRA BATTERIES 4. AC ADAPTER ( got mine for $20.00) 5.

The reason I ultimately bought it was because it was a great value--including many extra items ( both 4 alkaline and 4 NiH rechargeable batteries, battery recharger, Adobe software, UBC Cord, etc.)that the others did not.  However, I was concerned because there were reviews that mentioned that the Adobe software was difficult to use and you could not e-mail pictures using it. Both negative comments were dead wrong.First, I must say that the camera takes truely OUTSTANDING pictures.  It is also relatively easy to use.  The manual that comes with it is well written and easy to understand.  It comes with a quick-guide and you can literally be taking pictures within minutes.The Adobe software is truely outstanding too.  Its only negative is it does not come with a manual so you have to plow through the instructions on the computer and very often use the help screen. However, you can make all kinds of adjustments to your pictures and come out with a first rate pictures.  I like to save the pictures to my hard drive in the JEP format. If I want to e-mail them, I simply  send the pictures as attachments from there.  No problem.Regardless, the pictures and the software are great and any negative comments you may read from others probably are from first time buyers like myself who got frustrated with the learning curve and time it takes to get to know a new camera, new technology, how to use the software and how to print photographs.  For a novice, it takes considerable time to learn.  There are no shortcuts. However, once you get the hang of it, you get  fantastic results!!!One mistake I made was buying a card reader.  I have a 800mh processor and the USB cable that comes with the camera literally takes seconds to transfer.  If you have a slow processor, you may need a card reader.One thing  I definitely advise you to get is an AC adaptor.  It is a must or you will drain the batteries.  If you are going to go for a long weekend or plan to take a considerable number of pictures, you may want to buy both extra rechargeable batteries and an extra picture card.Ihave a HP deskjet 952 printer.  I have found some Kodak 4X6 borderless print paper.  It comes with one or two pictures per page.  For the single page, I turn it upside down in my tray (with the Kodak name up) and locate it all the way to the far right.  I set the settings just the way the instructions say and I get the most unbelieveable pictures you can imagine.  Once I got the hang of it, people in my office asked me where I was getting them developed! Another major positive is that Kodak has a \"technical help desk.\" I called them a couple of times regarding how to use the new paper with my particular printer.  They have an 800 number,answered right away, and were incredibly helpful and knowledgable.  This was a major plus and helped me over several frustrating humps.Regardless, this camera is a great value since it inclues many extras and provides outstanding quality pictures.  Beginers do need to invest time--and be forewarned it can get very frustrating but it all falls into place with time.  If you are on the fence, buy it.

As much as I'd like to stay with my old SLR, it's time to move from film to disk. I've had the Kodak 280 for 3 months and I'll say that it was a good buy. The pictures are very good,  it's easy to use - just point and click. As with any automatic camera, you  don't have great control over exposure and lens settings, but for indoor  and typical outdoor shots, its fine. The USB downloads fast compared to  serial. The rechargeable batteries dye after about 30 downloaded pictures  to your PC... get the optional AC cable (I think 39$). Everything digital  is overpriced for what it is. My camera does sometimes act quirky; but I  think it always has to do with low batteries. You'll have to get another  set of the rechargeable nickel metal hybrid batteries if you go on the road  with your camera. And the software is ok. The downloading should be easier  when you don't want to touch up your photos.I'll keep my 35 mm SLR for  those vacation trips where I'll take 10 rolls of film and I want more  camera control, but if you want instant, good quality pictures in an  everyday, take it anywhere camera (as long as you don't need more than 35  pictures before downloading), this is the camera.

Some of these, I've taken duplicate pictures with 35mm or APS, and the colors on this camera (DC280) comes out way ahead.A case in point, one ocean picture by the DC280 showed detail in the distant fog, along with varying reflections (of the fog) on the water. Dark blue sky filled in behind and above the fog.  The APS picture was all washed out - you could hardly tell the difference between the fog and sky. Both were taken with automatic exposure settings, and taken within 1 minute of each other.Down side to this camera is that 1) It eats through baterries (common problem to these types of cameas - fortunately Koday supplies NiMH rechargable batteries); 2) Limited zoom range; and 3) LCD display gets washed out in the sunlight.Up side to this camera are 1) Excellent sharpness in prints up to 5x7 - okay in 8x10; 2) Colors that will knock your socks off (much better than the Nikon Coolpix 950 that I use at work); 3) It acts and feels like a real camera; 4) Software and Camera operations are very natural and easy to learn (I'm still stuggling with the Nikon, and I'm a computer engineer!)Bottom line: This is an excellent entry into the digital world.

It is very simple to use, yet includes the essential features for all but the most serious photographers.  The annoying feature that makes me give this a 4 star rating is the location of the LCD screen - I found that if I use my right eye (which is my dominant eye) in the viewfinder that my nose touches the LCD screen and smudges it.  Come on Kodak, that was a goof.  This does not effect the quality of piuctures, its just annoying until you realize that it is a hopeless battle to keep the LCD clean.Other than that, it is terrific.

The Kodak is much bulkier, and the  lens cap has to be manually replaced and is easily knocked off the minute  you put it in your backpack (actually the stupid thing is always falling  off!).

The pictures (mostly indoors) look spectacular.  I love the fact that I can  preview and chose the pictures I like.  I have been a long time 35 mm user  but I think my Canon EOS will now have to retire for good.The camera is  very easy to figure out. I have never even picked up a digital camera  before this one, but it only took me 20 minutes to figure everything out.  The controls are clear and easy to understand.  I was amazed by the quality  of pictures (both indoors and outdoors).  The camera winds into place ready  to take another picture within seconds (I understand this is a big problem  with some other digital cameras, even the KodaK 290 which is far more  expensive, that take forever to get ready for the next picture).  Focusing  is as easy as with my Canon and I was able to preview the pictures right  away, first on the camera, then on my computer and finally as a slide show  on my TV (great feature for family gatherings). You can also see what a  picture would look like before you even take it. I also managed to use the  framing feature for some cool effects, as well as the B&W feature to  make some of my cat's picture look very \"astistic\".  There are  several other features (like the ability to record date and time on the  Picture)  but it would take too much time and space to mention.Now the  bad things.  Battery life is miserably short, and if you plan to use the  screen in the back of the camera to review your pics, then good luck. You  definetely need to get an AC adapter  so when you are reviewing your  pictures at home, you don't waste batteries.  And when you go out take at  least 2 set of baterries with you.  The software that came with the camera  crashed my computer a few times (and I have a 600Mhz Pentium III).  I  understand there are some downloads that I need to get, so maybe that will  fix the problem.  And my big complaint, I payed so much money for camera,  but all I got with it was a measly 8mb card that holds less than 20  pictures. I had to shell another $140 for a 64 Mb flash card so I can take  as many pictures as I want (well, not really, I think it is about  100)Overall though, this camera is perfect for beginners (who never used  a digital camera before) and experts.

You can preview your pictures and discard them on the spot, thus  saving room for more pictures.  You can get a 96MB Compact flash memory  card (think of it as the \"film\" of a digital camera) which will  hold hundreds of pictures, (great for vacations when you don't take your  computer).

And why not. Kodak has had most of a century learning how to reproduce color,  and they have applied it to their new-fangled digital cameras.  You will  not believe what you see on the screen of your computer monitor - can a  digital camera really be this good?  It looks like a Kodachrome slide -  heck, it looks better!Printing is another thing.  The reason pro  photographers and serious ameteurs have preferred slides is because the  range of contrast is much greater than prints - prints can only reflect  light, not generate it, as can a slide projector or computer monitor.  So a  great deal is lost in going to prints in terms of light; and as even your  basic printer can print at 300 dpi, the lower resolution of the digital  camera makes its effects felt.  However, I find 8x10 prints at the highest  resolution of the DC280 quite acceptable (using a HP832c).  But the camera  cannot make uncompressed files - all files are JPEG compressed to some  extent, and the artifacts may show.  This is a point and shoot camera;  no control of focus, shutter speed, or aperture is possible. The camera is  a little heavy, and you wish for hooks for a neck strap. You wish for more  buttons on the body of the camera, rather than having to go through levels  of menus.  The lens front is very vulnerable (and the lens cap is not  automatic) - it would be wise if the lens were protected by a protruding  metal or plastic guard, as some of Kodak's competitors do.I find the  battery life using Kodak's supplied metal hydride batteries quite  acceptable, particularly if you buy a second set; but the supplied  alkalines lasted only through the evening I bought the camera.I am a  wide angle person rather than a telephoto person, but in an ideal world, a  3x rather than a 2x would be welcome - 60mm (equiv.) is hardly telephoto.  This is basically a wide angle to normal lens.I've been a darkroom  photographer since 1952, and a sometime professional since 1959 - I am  delighted to see the end of chemical photography, with its dangerous  chemicals and the near impossibility for amateurs of getting good results  in color.

We did a great deal of research before purchasing this camera, including reading reviews of many different digitals from customers on Amazon and other sites.  We quickly learned what the major issues of importance to us would be:  (1) picture quality; (2) battery life; (3) convenience/ease of use; and (4) overall value, considering 1-3.  We decided on the DC280 because of the features, above average customer reviews, and the price.That said, we remained a bit concerned about battery life and convenience.  As you can see from all the reviews, digital cameras (this one included) have the reputation for eating batteries and we didn't want to trade film and development costs for battery expense and the hassle of always changing and buying them.  Take this as gospel:  if you do not use the LCD screen as a viewer to set up your shots, you will enjoy surprisingly long battery life.  We regularly snap more than 100 shots (a week's worth or more) and then pass the camera around to let everyone review them on the LCD screen.  The batteries last if you just take reasonable, minimal care, and with an extra set of rechargables you will probably never feel the crunch, even as snap-happy tourists on vacation somewhere.Second, we had read that upper-end cameras (in the $600-1,000 range) could snap pictures rapidly one after another but that cameras such as the DC280 had an infuriatingly long lag time from one shot to the next--up to 12 to 15 seconds--while the camera processed and saved the data.  We braced ourselves for this inconvenience.  STUPID US!  It took two weeks before we realized by accident that you can take up to four or five pictures in very rapid succession before finding the need to cool it for a few seconds.  That is fine, and since we're not professionals needing to do rapid bursts for sports shots all day, we find no difference compared with how strenuously we used our film cameras (in fact, we get a whole lot more out of this one than our film cameras).There is a lot more I could go on about, but the short of it is that this camera is amazing and has itself dispelled many falsehoods we read about cameras in its price range (and higher).  We have two little children and buying film, developing it, making duplicates, and mailing them out to family everywhere had become a real financial burden and hassle.  Consequently, we barely took any pictures anymore.  With the DC280 now, we have snapped more than 600 pictures in 5 weeks (the equivalent of 25 rolls, $250 for film and development).  Everyone in our family already has a CD with 500 pictures on it, with more on the way.  And we now have photos for our own collection that we otherwise would never have had.If you have any doubts about which digital camera to choose anywhere near this price range, jump at this one before you miss out.

After reading all the reviews on Amazon.com I decided on the Kodak DC 280 and what a GREAT choice.The camera is VERY easy to use.  I am digital camera stupid and even I was taking pictures within 10 minutes of opening the box.MEMORY.  I took the advice of most reviewers and bought a 32MB flash card.  A very good decision which I highly recommend.  What none of the reviews told me was that the 32MB card holds about 50 pictures when you have the camera on the highest reslution.  If you go for medium or lower resolution you of course get a lot more. I just use my camera for everyday pictures and the 32 MB card is just fine.SOFTWARE.  You must have software to download the pictures from the camera.  The DC 280 comes with Kodak's camera control software, a very simple picture manipulation software called Arcsoft, and Adobe's photodeluxe 2.0 and Adobe pageMill 3.0.  The Arcsoft program is baby simple and I was using it with no problem to do my first picture downloads.  It even lets you do basic picture manipulation.  If you just want to take pictures for everyday memories or internet postings then this is all the software you will ever need.  I was a little scared that the PhotoDeluxe software would be to complicated to use so I didn't download it till last week.  Turns out It too is a piece of cake to operate and its much more powerful than the Arcsoft software. I now use the Photodeluxe software over the Arcsoft. Bottomline, the software that comes with the camera is VERY easy to use and unless you are a big time or serious photographer its all the software you need.DONLOADING PICTURES.  I download pictures directly from the camera to the computer and its doable but slow, especially if you downloading the entire memory card.  My next purchase is to buy one of those flash card readers which other reveiwers recommend.BATTERIES.  The camera comes with one set (4) rechargeable batteries and a recharger.  I would definately get a second set of rechargeable batteries, but not another recharger.  As long as you have one set of batteries ready to go you will be fine.  And if you don't have any batteries recharged ready to go you can always use regular batteries.  If you take pictures using the normal and recommended \"Capture\" mode the batteries will last through an entire 32MB memory card - no problem. Plus they only take a couple of hours to recharge.CHARGER.  If you do not get one of those flash card readers I would difinately buy the AC/DC adapter.  When you download pictures directly from the camea you are using up battery power.

It's also fairly easy to use.Did I mention the pictures? Wow. I used to have a Pansonic digital camera and it wasn't as good as this DC280, (okay, so it was only a 1.3 megapixel). The picture quality is excellent. I really don't have to modify the images, sharpen them, or adjust the lighting within Photoshop. I basically crop the pictures, and send them out.A really nice add on was the rechargeable batteries and recharger that were included with the DC280. Of course, it came with 4 AA standard batteries, too. :-) You can also buy a lens adapter so you can add on different lenses, such as super wide angle and telephoto lenses.A reviewer did mention that the LCD screen is in an awkward place, so your nose does smudge it quite a bit. Also, sometimes the lens cap falls off the camera lens, but it is attached to the camera at least, so at least you won't lose it.I purchased a 64 MB compactflash card to replace the 8 MB card that came with it. You should try to purchase it on-line... Amazon had it cheaper. I also bought a USB Compactflash card reader which was so much easier and faster to use than downloading the images from the camera (the DC280 also supports USB).If Amazon doesn't have the camera in stock, you can find it at Buy.com--it'll take a few days to get it.

Most people have used a camera; but obviously I had never hooked one up to my machine before!It couldn't have been easier. I simply read in the instructions which slot the USB plug went into on the camera -- I had already plugged it into my computer -- turned the camera mode to \"connect\" and flipped it on. Windows recognized the camera, and the photo wizard in XP allows very easy transfer into a folder of your choosing. You can also get the photos directly from the camera and bypass the wizard, but I haven't felt the need to do that.The photos themselves have pretty good color -- I do have to up the contrast more often than not in Paint Shop Pro, but that's not a big deal. The colors, if the light isn't that great, tend to be a little washed out, just like a regular camera.Overall, I love my new camera and have found nothing to complain about.

The 8MB card holds at minimum 12 high res photos.There is about a one second delay between when you push the button and when the camera flashes the photo, so you have to wait and hold the camera still so it is not so good for moving objects or sports events.Also the zoom is good but not good enought for the sports events I go to for great distant shots.

I gave the  camera a \"one star\" rating, which, under the circumstances, is  very generous.
