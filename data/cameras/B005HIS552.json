As in any composite package, it is mixed.  The alternate fixed lenses are of limited use.  SD card is great, SD card/USB holder works great.  Love the backpack case -just right for traveling around with room for other stuff when site seeing.  Ideally, would ditch the extra fixed lenses and get a flash.  But still an amazing deal!!!Retailer is great.  Ordered it just after Hurricane Sandy and it came very fast.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Recomendado 100%", "Author": "Ernesto Freites", "ReviewID": "RVT0FGQ2F0V5I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Muy responsables y llego a tiempo el paquete.Gracias llego todo en muy buenas condiciones a venezuela y a tiempo.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$759.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 15 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Canon EOS Rebel T3i Digital SLR Camera Body & EF-S 18-55mm IS II Lens + <2> Canon EF-S 55-250mm IS Lens + <3> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card +\n<4> PD DSLR Sling Backpack + <5> RC-6 Shutter Remote Control + <6> Spare LP-E8 Battery + <7> Vivitar 58mm UV Glass Filter +\n<8> Additional Vivitar 58mm UV Glass Filter + <9> .45x Wide Angle Lens (58mm) + <10> 2x Telephoto Lens (58mm) + <11> Precision Design 57\" Tripod +\n<12> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <13> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <14> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <15> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T3i Digital SLR Camera Body & EF-S 18-55mm IS II Lens with 55-250mm IS Lens + 32GB Card + .45x Wide Angle & 2x Telephoto Lenses + Tripod + Case + Battery + Remote + (2) Filters + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZiIuhl8%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005HIS552"}}
