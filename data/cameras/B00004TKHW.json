I was going to buy the model  under it that only records 640 x 480 but I am glad I didn't now.  The  difference in recording at 1.3 megapix versus 640x480 is very noticable.  If you just want a basic camera, go for the lesser model but if you are  already spending that much, go ahead and chunck down the extra 200 bucks,  it is very well worth it.  This camera is very easy to use.  I love the  fact that you can record on floppies.  NO need to install software or  cabels.  I use this camera at work which is why I got the floppy drive on a  digital camera.  People need pics taken of different things, you take them,  just hand them the disk when you are finished, no need to run to a computer  to download then transfer to disk.  The drive writes really quickly on this  camera, so hardly no waiting at all.  Also love the fact of it having a  rechargeable battery.  It uses the same battery as my sony handcam so I  actually have two batteries and they use the same charger, so that was an  added bonus.  The battery charges in about 20 minutes to full capacity and  lasts about 60 pictures before needing charging.  I did have a minolta  digital camera without the floppy and the recharagable batteries and I tell  you, it was eating those AA batteries up fast.  So I am very satisfied with  this product.", "Date": "September 6, 2000"}, {"Title": "Excellent mid-range digital Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1V544324APGRW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The FD-85 is an excellent choice for a balance of great options and capabilities for price.  Its 1.3 mega pixel resolution provides for good crisp pictures.  It also has a nice 6x zoom (3x optical).  I prefer using  only optical zoom and 3x is a sufficient zoom for most applications.  But,  the best thing is the floppy drive.  No more cables and slow transfers.  It  especially comes in handy when visiting relatives and friends.  You can  download copies to their PC without having to carry around cables or  installing software on their computer.

The FD83 takes pictures that are much better.  I love being able to use floppies to record images... it's so wonderful to not have to use some cable or anything else to retrieve your pictures... just pop your disk into your computer and get started!I also love the video feature... I can take short little videos of my kids and email them to the grandparents who live elsewhere.  It's like giving them a chance to see their grandkids every day.  This camera is soooooo easy to use.  And when you use it, everybody says, \"Wow!  That's so cool!\"  And they want to know all about it, how much it cost, etc.The only flaw I've found: I do find that when I put the camera on the highest quality settings, I can only get about 6 pictures per floppy disk (yesterday's technology) which is somewhat annoying.  At some point, I will probably invest in the Smart/Memory Stick (tomorrow technology) and an adaptor which will allow me to take tons of pictures at one setting.I really love this camera... a great investment!", "Date": "October 16, 2000"}, {"Title": "More Pictures; Less Cost", "Author": "Owned and Loved by Schnauzers \"Owned by Schna...", "ReviewID": "R3QTFED09F254F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a perfect camera -- finally!

The menu tool on the display monitor is very easy to use with very  little confusion.  It almost felt like second nature pressing all the  buttons to take me where I wanted to go.  Unfortunately the price leaves  little to be desired.  I imagine that digital cameras will be the big hit  this Christmas season, so, wait for these products to go down in price a  little before buying such a major purchase.  If you check out my previous  reviews I made a review about the Panasonic portable DVD player and the  price of that item in October 1999 was $1100.00, I think it's probably  under that figure now.  The utmost thing to do with products like this is  COMPARE PRICES!  Check out other online stores as well as Amazon and check  out other electronics stores to get the best deal possible.  It's worth the  time and you can compare all products to see which one is right for you.

So far I couldn't be happier.  After much reading about digital camera's I knew I wanted this camera.  It seemed to me that using a floppy was much easier than having to hook up cables.  And it's a breeze to view the pictures I've taken !  The FD85 has an easy to understand menu that pops up on the LCD screen.  The mini movie feature is fun to play around with too.  Some folks talk about it's bulky size because of using a floppy disk to store the images, but it's no bigger than my Pentax K1000 35mm camera and lighter in weight.  And I don't have to drop everything to change to my zoom lens as with my Pentax.  One thing I didn't care for is the ArcSoft PhotoStudio software included with the camera.  It's cheap and very hard to adjust your pictures.  I never did get a decent photo printed out using that software.  So, I started using my Adobe PhotoDeluxe and it works great !  The pictures I've printed out have been of good quality and suitiable  for framing.  The only reason I didn't give this camera a 5 star rating was because I've only had it a week.  I will post another review after I've used it for several months.

Ikelite even makes an underwater housing for this camera, but it costs more than the camera does.

The truth is that once over one megapixel the differenece is nearly immpossibile to see by the human eye.

I was going to get the Mavica FD-71 (i believe thats the model #)...the order was all filled out then i clicked cancel bec. i wasn't sure...so i went with the better model...FD-85.  My friend has the FD-71 and i always thought it was a good camera.  Now that i have this one...i can see a HUGE DIFFERENCE in quality.  For the money it costs...GO FOR IT...you will not regret it one bit.  Take my review into great consideration...i will tell you the positives...for starters the quality is great..don't listen to any negatives about the quality because you will not be disapointed.  Next, the fact that it copys to a disk is amazing.  You can take all the pictures you want!  You can also copy the disk right there on the camera and give it to a friend.  Another amazing feature is that you can make short 15 second movies.  This is a great feauture to play around with.  It also has a audio/video out jack which allows you to use the camera to record a movie onto a VCR.  The best thing about this whole camera is the ease of use.  To be honest and straight out...an idiot can use this camera.  The menu set up and the options within the camera can be operated by a young child.  There are no cables to use and no software to load...just insert a disk and enjoy.  Sony has done it again.  All of my electronics are sony...TV, DVD, VCR, Receiver, and now camera...they are just the kings of electronics....you can't go wrong with anything they make.  Just trust me...buy this camera..spend the extra money.  Anyone who is involved with ebay should buy this for easy posting of auctions.

Have shot a thousand or more images without any problems.  I am a claims adjuster and use the camera mainly for work.  I basically compose the shot, point and shoot.  The only shortcomings that do not warrant the five star are:  the viewfinder is impossible to see with strong light striking it.  Also the flash needs help in very low light situations - like dark smoke residue rooms.  The battery that comes with the unit should be supplemented by purchasing an extra longer life battery to keep as a spare.  Great camera.

Parker", "ReviewID": "R2ML6TNCMDQXEE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera based on some previous experience with the Mavica FD-73 digital camera...which has lower specs, but its operation is almost identical.  I didn't want to put out too much money on this camera, yet I didn't want to chintz on the technical aspect.  Another reason I bought this camera is because Sony is one of the few (if not the only) manufacturer to say in its sales pitch that their camera does MPEGs...and in comparison tables, not all digicams make MPEGs.  As with a lot of new digital devices, there are almost too many bells & whistles built-in, to the point it's overwhelming.  However, with a little practice, and time spent reading the owner's manual (yes, be a nerd, and READ IT), it's quite easy to operate.  The sepia effects that are available are fantastic.  There are still a lot of features on this camera I need to explore.  One thing I have noticed on the MPEGs, is that if you double-click the filename, once you have the MPEG in/on your PC, it opens in a very small window, and the audio seems to be at double-speed.  However, when viewing with Media Player, it works fine.  Maybe it's just me.
