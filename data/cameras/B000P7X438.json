{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Little IP camera", "Author": "A. Madar \"AllanM77433\"", "ReviewID": "R2H3FYV9I9YI8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For an outdoor IP camera, this camera rates high with me and even more so after comparing it with the Toshiba IK-WB15A IP camera. I set it up as a weather cam, but found it did really great as a security cam. With a 2GB SD memory card in it, I have seen over 10,000 images on it. I record every passing vehicle, triggered by motion, and every 60 seconds for the weather. Looking forward to getting the MegaPixel version soon.Down side of this camera, no optical zoom options in this body style. The camera has a 10X digital zoom which is not something I see as not being good for much.Now the good side:Nice sharp images during the day time, even of moving objects like cars and people running past the camera.Automatically adjusts the shutter speed at night, and does good in low light level, but not good enough for sharp images of moving objects at night.Multiple alarm settings (5) really nice and easy to set up.Records a great sharp image of moving objects in day time. I see all who drive by! Makes a great stand-alone security camera.SD Memory card slot, with 2gb, I have about 10,000 images on it.Multi view Screen, view 4 cameras at one time.Can view and move PTZ over cell phone/PDAs.Fast PTZ.PTZ limits are nice and wide, both up and down, and side to side.Audio I/O are located where they are protected from the weather, unlike the Toshiba IK-WB15A, that you cannot use if you use the sun shield.Built in mic, very sensitive!! Not only can I see you, but I can hear you!POE, makes for easy installation! Would not have it any other way. Love it!Small body size.Good WB control, the colors are true.In general, I am very pleased with the way this camera works.", "Date": "June 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Value", "Author": "Gyropilot", "ReviewID": "R3RWFSWCV1Y7FL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As others have indicated, this camera is truly an exceptional value for the money.  Everything about it is of high quality from start to finsh... even the packaging it comes in is first rate.  I love Panasonic products.When doing my research on which brand and model of networked security camera to buy, I was a little concerned about not having an IR capable camera (such as this model).  But after reading the excellent low-lux specifications and good reviews, I took the plunge and bought 5 of these.  After using them for a month now, I'm nothing short of thrilled!With the \"Color Night View\" option enabled (it's turned off by default), the camera will automatically slow down the image refresh rate to compensate for low lighting conditions, which has the effect of brightening the image.  Even on dark cloudy nights I can still clearly see the area around our home and detect when anything is amiss.  The only drawback to using the Color Night View mode is that fast moving objects can appear blurred due to the slow image refresh rate.  But even with this minor shortcoming, I can still see if someone (or some critter) was moving around in the darkness on the camera's images.  However, since we have motion activated lights outside around our home, it pretty much makes that a moot point!I'm currently running all 5 of these cameras using two TRENDnet 8-Port 10/100Mbps PoE Switches which have 4 PoE ports each.  I'm recording the video feeds using the excellent i-Catcher Console software from i-Code.  Using the embedded web server in the i-Catcher software, I can monitor, operate the cameras, and playback recorded images directly on my iPhone (and it's formatted properly for the iPhone screen).  While at work I can check up on things around my home using either my iPhone or any web browser.To get the most from these cameras, and to be able to view the video feeds over the Internet, it helps to be comfortable around computers and networking.  But if you need help, Panasonic tech support is very responsive and helpful.I've posted a daylight and nighttime image from one of my camera feeds so you can see what it looks like.  I also posted a shot of the image playback screen from my iPhone.

The newer Panasonic BB-HCM735A outdoor model costs just a little bit more than what this one is currently selling for, but the 735A has a completely updated feature set.  The 735A uses the new MOS sensor with better low light capability, higher resolution options, H.264 streaming, shock detection, etc.  The 735A has the next generation technology that Panasonic is starting to incorporate in their product line, so why purchase this one that is 3 years behind and costs almost the same as the BB-HCM735A.2. If cost is a factor and you're not installing the camera directly exposed to rain, consider the indoor version of this model, the BB-HCM511A.  It costs a lot less (much better value!) and there is not much different between the two cameras except that this 531A model comes with a plastic cover to protect the cable openings in the back.  Some degree of weather protection can be achieved with the cheaper 511A model (for accidental moisture) using some tape over any exposed connector openings plus a layer of silicone aquarium sealant over the tape.  But if you know that your location is going to get dripping wet for sure, then I'd stick with the outdoor model.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Expensive but worth it", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2MGDJ0B67W1Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an extremely effective, practical and easy-to-use camera.  Bought two from Amazon.  Installation is a snap.  It comes with a sun/rain visor (not pictured), wallmount base, CD-ROM and all the associated screws.  All you need is a drill and some anchors.  LAN ports and audio ports are easily accessible at the rear.  I run mine using Power Over Ethernet.  You *will* need PoE injectors.  These can be bought separately; I used the TrendNet ones.  Note that the software does not seem to be Mac-compatible.Once the hardware was installed, I popped the CD-rom into my laptop.  The Panasonic software installed quickly and easily.  It found the cameras in seconds.  The images are viewed via a web browser.  The software came with the ActiveX controls necessary to view the images.The software is actually remarkably thorough, straightforward and finished.  In a word, it was professional.  I was viewing images within minutes of installation and adjusting the settings to suit my needs.  You can set triggers, day/night mode, time, video streaming, multiple cameras and so on very easily.  Everything is laid out.  A basic level of technical/computer skill helps.The image quality is nothing short of outstanding.  I've used several different makes and models - from the Home Depot Swann cameras to $1200 PTZ Day/Night dome cameras - and the Panasonic image quality is easily the best of the lot.  Clear, detailed, excellent depth, jitter-free and true.  The field of view is limited, as with most security cameras, but the range of motion is impressive.  Basically, you can adjust the camera and/or the lens to focus on any spot you want; just don't expect to have a 90-degree field of view.I had to swallow hard when buying this camera because of the price.  But I can honestly say it's worth every penny.  Only question now is durability.  Let's see how long it lasts.", "Date": "November 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Panasonic BB-HCM531A", "Author": "Christopher K.

I end up geting 2 of them and had them up now for three weeks. I Order the software that you can record up to 64 cameras at one time. Still testing out the cameras, works wonderful and been in in 3 rain stroms and held up great. The Software i got for the cameras Model:BB-HNP15A is nice and easy to record with. the Cameras are easy to set up but if you need help Panasonic Tech support will walk you through setup for each and every camera. You cant go wrong guys Panasonice Tech support will help you get up and running . I look for weeks for a camera set up and read up on forms and not allot of help out there when looking for IP Cameras, but i went with Panasonic after calling them first. I told them what i needed They will give you recommendation on cameras for your Needs. I Seen some Post on this Camera about not having a power source, YOU WILL NEED PoE \"Power Over Ethernet\" I got D-link DES-1008PA This is a 4 port PoE switch there are others out there but for under $200 good name brand. Hope this helps Oh one more thing Cat5E cable make sure you get the UV for out side will last longer from the weather. UPDATE 1/30/2010 Cameras still working great love them. Been in the Va. Summer heat and winter storms of 2009 and still runing strong.

I was tempted to go with the less expensive BB-HCN511A because it has very similar performance specification and I was mounting the camera under an eve and I felt like I could provide it adequate protection from the rain.  However, despite assumptions posted several places that suggest the 511A is the same as the 531A without the protective shell, I discover 2 key points that made me select the 531A for my outdoor location over the 511A.  First, the 531A has extra filters in the lens to protect it from sun directly in the lens. Second, the 531A allows opperation in very cold and hot conditions.  The 511A does not handle either of these circumstances.  So far, the BB-HCM531A has performed well for.The only con I have so far is that this model has been discontinued even though it is still widely available.  Since no replacement model has been identifed yet and I need several cameras immediately, I went ahead and installed the BB-HCM531A.", "Date": "September 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Easy to install security cameras.

With PoE installing these is very easy: just run the ethernet cable and screw in the base. You'll need to have a switch that supports PoE, I use the TRENDnet 8-Port 10/100Mbps PoE Switch (4x 10/100, 4x 10/100 PoE) and have 4 cameras running with it. If you run multiple cameras I'd recommend avoiding Network Camera Software and get Blue Iris for $50 instead.", "Date": "February 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Works great - but can take a lot of time to get it working", "Author": "R. Beckley \"bobb\"", "ReviewID": "R1RAEZFGP7SZEH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It took me 4 days to get this working.  I connected the security camera to a Power Over Ethernet switch box to my Motorola modem/router.  Everything worked on my home LAN.  I could view the camera from the house and pan it via the web software. However, it was not visible over the Internet, which is what I bought the camera for.  I called Panasonic, and after several hours of trying they suggested I call my ISP.  I called Charter Cable (my ISP provider) and they said they did not have any block on signals that would prevent the camera from being viewed.  After many calls over several days, I called Motorola, who made my modem.  They said that the modem did not support a static address (which is what the Panasonic documentation told me to set up).  They walked me through doing a DHCP Lease, adding in a new IP address (using the MAC address of the security camera) and bypassing the firewall.  Once this was added, in the Security camera software [...] , I went to the Setup tab, set Connection Mode to DHCP, set port to 50000, left other fields blank, and clicked Start and Restart the camera.  This set the camera up to accept DHCP for the camera on port 50000. I was now able to view the camera over the internet.So, if you are willing to stick with it and call Panasonic, the PoE switch box provider, the ISP provider, and the modem provider, you will find a configuration that works.  But there are a lot of pieces that need to be working together and I almost gave up along the way.  It took me over 10 hours of my time to get this working.Now that all the settings are ok, I am able to view the camera remotely (several states away) and it works beautifully.  The picture is clear and bright.  I can pan it and (digitally) zoom the camera.  I am very pleased with the result.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Geat PoE/IP camera", "Author": "408", "ReviewID": "R2LBNYTWTYBJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased two of these cameras for a vacation home. I can now monitor what's going on at our second home over the web. The install was fairly straightforward. I repurposed a couple of cat5 phone jacks to power the cameras with a PoE switch. The images are very good and there is even an included microphone to listen to. The zoom feature is a digital zoom, so expect degradation of the image. The pan and tilt features work well and you can program a number of positions in the software. The software might be the only hitch--took awhile to get it set up and I still have some difficulty with accessing the images on the web browser on my smart phone. I wish the housing of the cameras was other than silver, but this is a minor detail. Overall, very satisfied. One caution: on the camera page on amazon, they also noted customers often purchased a d-link PoE jack at the same time. The d-link PoE jack is not compatible and I had to return it (no hassles). I'm using the trend-net 8 port PoE switch and it works great.

Tech support is really good.  They will walk you through it step by step. Turns out that My dsl modem was not properly opening the port that I needed.  Had to deal with verizon and once that was resolved it all works perfectly.  side note - the issue was that I have an old dsl modem and it had to be bridged since it wouldn't accept a wide open setting.  unreal, should have been given a new modem but now my router is doing the work that modem use to do.I picked up a Trendnet wireless access point & Netgear GS108P so that I could add more POE Camera's in the future which i will be.  Using the GS108P was cheaper than buying a POE connection for each cam. So it is cam to Netgear POE Port, to Trendnet, to my router and out to the internet.Now that I have it completely setup and running, I will be buying at least one more 531a.if you know how to create a network this is real easy.  if you have an idea of how to do it, it isn't that bad and as i stated, tech support is awesome.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "PoE listed not compatible", "Author": "J.
