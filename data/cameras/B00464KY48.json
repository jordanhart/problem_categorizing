Cunningham", "ReviewID": "R1YRSIB0GILVC8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this stand-alone 4 camera DVR by itself because I wanted to add my own cams,so I bought the Sony CCTV 1/3\" day/nite camera because of its fantastic clear images and SPOTLITE LIKE nite time viewing. I added 2 cameras.  The Unit's quad picture to the TV monitor is very clear. The unit comes with a remote which is a plus. The instruction manual is very high tech and not very easy to decipher for the average person. It does not have a trouble-shooting section that would be of immense help.It is very  poorly written. When you apply the sensitivity for motion recording it is numbered from 1 thru 9, The book does not tell you which end is the most and least sensitive. This is just one example. It does not have real down to earth instructions. It has a USB slot for to capture video from a memory stick. It can also connect to the computer if you wish to do so.  I bought the Clover Cam DVR because it was name brand Quality and although I am not happy with the manual it does work for me, a homeowner for surveillance purposes.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$719.00", "Features": "4 Channels\n704 X 448 High Resolution\n500 Gb Hard Drive\nH.264 Video Compression\n120 Fps Display & Recording-Programmable On Each Channel", "Name": "Clover Cdr0440 4-Channel DVR with 500 Gb Hard Drive", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31IQYFLXj7L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00464KY48"}}
