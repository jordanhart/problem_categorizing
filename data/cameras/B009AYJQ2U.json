Being a long-time Nikon/Canon person and looking for a pocketable camera, I decided to give Olympus a try and bought the XZ-2 with the optional automatic lens cap. I used this camera extensively during my trip and I wanted to share my experiences.I'm no pro photographer - I just love taking pictures. Some of the gear I had in the past are Canon XSI with the kit lens, Canon 50D, and several Canon point-and-shoots including Canon S95. Some lenses I had were Canon 50mm f/1.8, Canon 50mm f/1.4, Canon 24-70mm, Canon 24-105mm, Canon 70-300mm, and Sigma 17-50mm f/2.8. I recently switched to Nikon - currently I have a Nikon D7000, a Nikon 35mm f/1.8 lens, and a Nikon 16-85mm lens. As the usual story goes, I also wanted something small and light where I could take with me instead of my D7000, so I purchased a Canon G1X as well - hoping that it would destroy my S95 in the IQ department. The G1X turned out to be a bad experience for me. First, it's not really pocketable - it's apparently smaller than the D7000, but you cannot carry it inside a belt bag. Second, it does not have the usual Canon colors - there is something wrong with the G1X colors, it's just not pleasant. Third, the camera is slow, I mean really slow as an 80-year old grandma. Fourth, forget about macro - it's just not a G1X thing. And fifth, it has a slow zoom; f/5.8 exactly on the tele end. The only thing G1X does really well is noise at high ISO - ISO 1600 pictures are virtually noise-free.Comparing the XZ-2 to G1X, XZ-2 is considerably smaller (though it has great ergonomics). In fact, XZ-2 is even smaller (apparently, not thinner) than a Samsung Galaxy S2 smartphone (I posted a picture of them next to each other). With an after-market hand-strap, I can easily carry the XZ-2 in a belt bag. The camera is fast and responsive, unlike the G1X. It has a super fast f/1.8-2.5 lens so it rarely needs to go up to high ISO's. Note that G1X and XZ-2 have the exact same zoom range: 28-112 equivalent. But G1X is f/5.8 on the tele end whereas XZ-2 is f/2.5. This means that, on the tele end, in a situation where XZ-2 needs ISO 400, G1X would need ISO 2000. Thus, even though XZ-2's high ISO capabilities are not as good as G1X, it does not really need that kind of capability thanks to its fast lens. Regarding macro, XZ-2 can focus as close as 1cm, which is worlds better than the G1X.Now, the most critical difference: XZ-2 colors and auto white balance just blow those of G1X out of the water - as simple as that. XZ-2 has the same imaging processor as in the crazy-popular Olympus OM-D, so now I understand. With both my Canons and Nikons, I have to use the standard picture style for people pictures and the vivid picture style for travel and scenery; both with some amber shift, to get the colors I like. In XZ-2, I almost always get beautiful, jaw-dropping, splendid, fantastic, great, awesome colors with just the neutral picture style with no tweaking what-so-ever.Can XZ-2 beat Nikon D7000? Of course not. Even at ISO 100, D7000 pictures are sharper and cleaner with much better dynamic range than XZ-2. But that is not the point. You would take XZ-2 to places only where you can't bring along your DSLR gear. And as far as that purpose is concerned, XZ-2 gets the job done nicely.Some other fun things I like about XZ-2: It has a dual-mode ring around the lens. Just grap it for a program shift - it's that easy. In addition, it's got a beautiful high-res tilting screen with excellent color tonality. And the best part is, it is touchscreen! Yes! That's what I'm talking about. I can scroll through images with the swipe of a finger, I can zoom in and out, and I can set the focus point by touching on the screen. If I want, I can set the camera to focus first and then immediately take the picture. Brilliant. Thank you Olympus. Once you start using a touchscreen camera, you will never want to go back (just imagine the last non-touchscreen mobile phone you had).To wrap things up, Olympus XZ-2 is a great little fun camera that I can whole-heartedly recommend to fellow enthusiasts. It's not the cheapest point-and-shoot around, but I believe it is worth it. I suspect that XZ-2 will be a popular carry-everywhere camera once it is released in the U.S.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little camera - *nearly* a replacement for your ILC... but focus issues", "Author": "Paul Liesenberg \"pablo\"", "ReviewID": "R5O12O63OYJG5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Many years ago I owned an Olympus OM4. Then convenience won over. I got a Canon Prima 115 (which took awesome snapshots) and then the digital era dawned, and I had a number of compacts ans semi-compacts (Leica Digilux, Canon G and S series). One day, the Olympus E-PL1 came out, and I decided I wanted to explore more options. An E-P2 followed. Then the OMD EM5. And a stable of lenses. I am a huge fan of M43, which combines great tools for the job at hand (lens quality and decent sensor size) with convenient portability. But even the OMD EM5 sometimes is too cumbersome to carry around. Yet with phone cameras becoming decent snapshot tools, in my opinion you do need a very special compact camera to make it worth taking around. Something that offers you creative options in a compact format. Enter the Olympus XZ series.For my compact needs, for several years, I had a camera that did the job awesomely, and probably still could: the Canon S90. And if I didn't own a number of Olympus M43 cameras, the Canon S series would be my go-to choice. I loved the S90. But I did get the XZ-1. I replaced the S90 with the XZ-1 because I simply grew into the Olympus on-camera and off-camera process. If I use it with my M43, why not use it in my compact? No the XZ-1 is not the most compact \"compact\", but it's still compact enough that I lost it while on a trip. I forgot it in a restaurant and naturally someone with a good eye for quality snatched it.So I recently (and unwillingly) replaced the XZ-1 with the XZ-2. The same things I loved about the XZ-1 are things I love in the XZ-2, namely:* Lens quality and IQ: enough has been written about this. No, it will not beat your $4K Nikon with a $1k lens in low light, but hey, I am not even sure why people waste so much time debating this stuff on the web. fact is, in many conditions a good compact like the Canon S series and the Olympus XZ series (and others) take pictures that are truly all the quality you need, come on. You can blow them up to the size of a billboard. Amazing how far camera tech has come.* Between the very fast lens (pretty unique for it to stay fast throughout the range) and the creative tools and the post-processing on-camera tools you can do very, very cool stuff in a very streamlined process, provided you learn the features of the camera (mandatory with Olympus cameras in general, imho).* While there is a lot of talk about the difference between the XZ-1 and the XZ-2 sensor, I honestly couldn't care less. I find the differences minute and find both cameras can take amazing pictures. And I do own the OMD EM5 and the Oly 75:1.8 and Panny 25:1.4 lenses, among others, so I am not comparing lightly.* The *is* one big performance difference between the XZ-1 and XZ-2, and the XZ-1 actually wins it: the XZ-2 has very erratic focus behavior, especially at short range in the higher (>75mm) range. I attribute this to the fact that the XZ-1 had normal, macro and super-macro focus choices, whereas the XZ-2 did away with regular macro, trusting the cameras intelligence to establish what is required... and it fails often. Ugh. Hopefully this is something they fix in firmware asap. Update 3/25/13: it seems that either I have configured something or have somehow adapted to the XZ-2 ways, and now I rarely encounter the focus issue. So there seem to be ways around it.* This is a very personal thing, but it makes the XZ choice easy for me: I truly like the Olympus post-processing tools. One tool I love (and which subjects I photograph also love) is the Olympus ePortrait tool. Think me crazy, but it is the main reason I picked XZ over anything else. It makes taking smooth, flattering portraits so easy. Your own mileage might vary there: I know you can do the same thing in Photoshop Elements (which I also own to do other stuff), but it takes *longer*. The Oly ePortrait is smart and under-marketed and perhaps under-used by owners.* The noticeable difference between the XZ-1 and XZ-2 is video. The XZ-1 took HD video, but the limit was 7 minutes. With the XZ-2 you get nearly 30mins if your SD card size allows for it.* The XZ-1 however beats the XZ-2 when it comes to feeling \"compact\". I know this is personal choice, but I have very little use for articulated screens, nor for the grip. I would have preferred the abilities of the XZ-2 to be packed in a body that feels even more compact than the XZ-1, not less.* First thing I did was to remove the silly huge lugs Olympus mounted on this camera and which further pulverize the illusion of it being any more portable than the OMD: exactly the same lugs, and I did remove them from the OMD too. And only a cheap neck-strap, not a wrist-strap included? The XZ-1 only included a wrist-strap).* As a scuba diver, the underwater cases for the XZs are great, and the very open lens all the way through the focal range is awesome (the Canon S also has a great and very compact case, but the lens gets really slow in the long range, and we are starved for light underwater)...Yes, I do think Olympus for now has over-priced the XZ-2 in a very competitive market segment. Hence you can only read 5 reviews of it as I write this down. The price will come down inevitably.But I think the Olympus has a great little lens, great IQ, fancy creative tools and that ePortrait thing going for it. There are other great cameras in this segment, but if -like me- you are invested into Olympus post-processing or you like the tools available (they are fun if you explore them), the XZ-2 has some key strengths. If you are a portrait shooter you should definitely check Olympus' ePortrait feature out - it's pretty awesome. I will refrain from making generic statements about \"better than ..\", because no big camera company has fools designing cameras and the available products in this market niche are all very capable. I am sure the Sony RX100 is mind-blowingly amazing for just $100 more, but because I am invested in Olympus processing I hope you understand where I come from saying that, to me, it was a semi-easy choice. I say semi-easy because you can still get the XZ-1, a great camera that does a lot of the same thing equally well, for $200 less. The XZ-1 is fantastic too. :)In the end, I had to -at least for now- take a star away from the XZ-2 because of focus issues and because it feels less compact than the XZ-1. The XZ-1 still gets the full 5 stars for price-performance and would be my recommendation until Olympus fixes focus behavior on the XZ-2, which is problematic for my shooting style.On the focus issue, here are some things I wrote elsewhere:Here is my theory...I recently replaced my lost (sigh..) XZ-1 with the XZ-2. At first I was totally taken back by the temperamental focus behavior, which the XZ-1did not display. Then I noticed 2 things:1. The camera seems to hunt more in the >75mm range, which with a fast lens at shorter distances means a lot of the area around your subject is blurry.2. Olympus has done away with the macro focus mode the XZ-1 had. The regular focus range covers macro to eternity, and the super macro is extreme stuff.My pet theory is these 2 factors conspire to overtax the focus algorithm.So I tried to make things easier for the focus algorithm: no more multizone crap, AF area is now center square only... As I mostly use center weighted exposure stuff too. Try it and se if it makes things easier. Things improved for my shooting style.Focus also suffers from shake. If IS works, focus algorithms work harder. Go higher ISO, 1600 is finally usable in a compact.So while things are better for me, I think Oly made a mistake doing away with macro mode. With this lens the focus algorithm just can't cope with all the variables.I hope a forthcoming firmware update either fixes this or brings back regular macro mode.", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great camera overall but a worthwhile upgrade from the XZ-1?", "Author": "S. Vogt", "ReviewID": "R3B0FHVB08VYJS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I think the Olympus XZ-2 is a great, if overpriced camera but there is one key aspect that upgraders from the XZ-1 might think about before going to this model.The camera feels solid and well made and comfortable to shoot with. It's a little bigger with its predecessor so it's not as compact. But it's not as big as the Nikon P7700. The LCD is decent on back. The touch screen works very well for touch shutter/touch focus. However, one thing I've noticed that autofocus performance suffers a bit using the touchscreen vs. using the shutter button on top. It's not really bad but you do notice it. I suspect a firmware upgrade might fix that.The dial up front is great. It feels much more solid than its predecessor and now, like on Canon's S-series, you can customize it to adjust whichever settings you want. I personally am not a manual focus person but if you are into manual focus, this is the best enthusiast compact you can buy. With a flip of that switch on the front of the camera, the lens ring can be used to manually focused and it works very well. Battery life could use some improvement, it seems like it drains very quickly when using the touch screen.The camera has very good autofocus performance for the most part and in most shooting conditions. Shot to shot times are good. And I encountered no delays when shooting in RAW and writing to the card (but it is advisable to use a Class 10 SD to maximize performance). The lens is a little slow to zoom in and out, which other enthusiast compacts have that issue, but some don't (Canon G15).The menu system could use some streamlining, to be honest. I really hate having to dig into the menu system to adjust things like exposure compensation when other cameras in this price range have it as a physical dial. It's highly recommended that you read the manual first to find out where everything is. It's also important to read the manual, so you can understand the depth of the features on this cameras. Olympus really went all out to put an enthusiast feature set on this camera.As far as image quality is concerned....I would say the camera overall does have a noticeable improvement over its predecessor in a lot of areas. But one area which I think the XZ-1 still does better is color performance. Not that the XZ-2 is terrible in that regard, but the XZ-2's colors just lack the punch that the XZ-1 had and aren't as contrasty. You can of course adjust the parameters as you see fit but even so, I still think the XZ-1 has better colors in most instances. The XZ-2, however, has a little bit better detail capture and much improved ISO performance. Photos at ISO800 on the XZ-2 look much cleaner than from the XZ-1 and much more detail is retained. However, with such a fast lens, it's possible that you may rarely have to use ISO800 for shooting. The camera also has a tendency to overexpose, so it's important that you dial in some negative exposure compensation.I think the XZ-2 is a solid camera and competitive in a number of areas. But if you are an existing XZ-1 user thinking about getting the XZ-2, there's a chance you still might like your daylight photos from the XZ-1 better due to the reasons mentioned above. You just have to decide whether the other aspects of the camera make it a worthwhile upgrade. If you're deciding between this and the Sony RX100...I think the Sony RX100 has better image quality but the XZ-2 provides a more enjoyable shooting experience overall (and still produces decent photos). You might find that XZ-2 offers a lot more features for the money and deem it worthwhile to sacrifice sensor size for a camera that packs a lot more into it.", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent point and shoot", "Author": "chris d williams", "ReviewID": "R4OKGKZLQ9OB5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not sure why I read about these negative reviews other than to think they are industry hatched.

I dare you...", "Author": "R. Jones \"Coffee Hound\"", "ReviewID": "R1OHFTP45UJB3Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About me.  I'm not photo a equipment expert nor a professional photographer.  I am a photo equipment enthusiast and love taking pictures.  I have good eyes, good senses, and steady hands and I know quality when I see it.  I look at 100% Crops, but I'm not a pixel peeper by any stretch.  Here's some of the good stuff I've owned and used:  Canon 60D; Canon Pro 1; Canon T4i; Pentax K-5; Pentax K-20; Canon G1X; Canon s95 and s100; Canon SX-40; Sony Apha Nex-6; Sony RX100; Olympus epm2; a couple of point and shoot Nikons that I don't even remember the model numbers;  and a ton of glass to support the interchangeables above.  Does that make me an expert - not by a long shot.  I does makes me moderately informed.So why the Olympus XZ-2?  Like a lot of people I've been on an extended search for a GOOD bridge camera that's high on quality,  not too big, not too small, loaded with features, an just simply takes beautiful photos.  Because of its lack publicity and unimposing presence in the \"favorites\" market (have you looked at Snapsort lately - anything Canon or Sony is just about always going to come out on top when compared to anything Canon or Sony), Olympus had never been on my list of favorites either.  But like a lot enthusiasts who eventually tire of lugging around the Canon OR Pentax OR Nikon behemoths (all the way down to the G1X) I was still reluctant to trade bulk and weight by sacrificing top of the line features and QUALITY. That's when I started looking at Olympus' line of Pen cameras and their point and shoot line of fix lens counterparts.  The search led me first to the Pen epm2.  WOW.  This lttle gem with all of its available lens and accessories blew me away in both the quality and feature set categories.  The epm2 then led me to start looking for an Olympus fixed lens alternative, and that's when I found he Stylus XZ-2.  A day after I got it, I am convinced - I guess you could say, I'm a believer.  This is one of the coolest \"bridge\" style camera's I've ever used and I've used some of the best including the Canon G-12 and the G1X as well as the old Pro-1.  With its wide 1.8 telephoto lens it's fast, it's accurate, has an articulating screen,  it can be fitted with some of the neatest accessories including electronic viewfinders, hot shoe flashes, audio microphone to mention a few.  And the botton line - IT TAKES FABULOUS PHOTOS throughout its range of settings.  So, Canon/Nikon/Pentax afficianados, want to treat yourself to something really different and really fun and inspiring?  Take a look at the Olympus Stylus XZ-2.

Johnston", "ReviewID": "R3JXWTKRK6LB2S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an enthusiast and very-part-time pro. I bought this camera to replace an aging Panasonic LX5. But who am I kidding? The LX5 was still exceptional. I bought this camera because I wanted it. And because I was spending two weeks in Europe. I took nearly 2000 photos with my XZ-2 while I was overseas, and the results were beyond my expectations. And, as an enthusiastic owner of the LX5 (and the LX3 before it), my expectations were high.I took some incredible low-light, hand-held, high-ISO shots inside dark cathedrals clinging to the cliffs of Cinque Terre with incredible results. I took jaw-dropping shots of the sunset over the Mediterranean that look exactly how I remembered it. I took ridiculously atmospheric photos of the sun peeking out from beneath golden storm clouds behind the Eiffel Tower from the Jardin des Tuileries, silhouetting travelers huddling under umbrellas by ancient statues. I've also taken plenty of awesome shots of my dog.I am so impressed by this camera, and how fun and satisfying it is to use. Yes, you will get shallower DOF and cleaner low-light shots from a more expensive DSLR or ILC. But, really, who cares? I'm tired of carrying a bunch of gear and switching lenses while watching my shot opportunity disappear. The XZ-2 is, in my mind, without limitation for general purpose photography. With the XZ-2, I will certainly miss shots I could have nailed with better gear. But I will nail so many more shots with the XZ-2 that I would have missed with my ILC gear because I left it at home.I sold all my Nikon DSLR gear last year in favor of an OM-D and the micro 4/3 system. But guess where my OM-D was when I was in Europe? It was at home, on a shelf. The OM-D is also an amazing camera, but it's seldom in my bag or pocket like my phone and XZ-2 are. I'm currently wrestling with myself on the issue, but I'm 54% sure I'll be selling the M43 gear in favor of the XZ-2 (and other incredible compact enthusiast cameras to come--they just keep getting better).A few very minor issues:-I'd love to see an auto ISO limit setting, like on the OM-D. The auto ISO setting can honestly be trusted in most situations, but it would be nice to have a bit more control. Firmware update, Olympus? UPDATE: The XZ-2 already has this feature. I somehow overlooked it.-I would rejoice for an XZ-2 (XZ-3?) with a high-quality, built-in EVF or hybrid OVF.-In my opinion, enjoyment of this camera depends on the automatic lens cap, which adds to the price.Anybody wanna buy an M43 kit?", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the money", "Author": "Jose V Oliva", "ReviewID": "RSPYH52DP5FWG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now that the camera is heavily discounted, it is a very good buy because of its fast aperture lens, features and available manual controls.

I was thinking to buy an evf for it but I'm very happy I don't need to because the articulate display works great in sunlight (you can move it up and down) and has much better resolution than the XZ-1 and it is touch sensitive. Focusing is just so so fast. The built quality is first class it is almost if it was not a point and shoot category more like a Pen camera. The front ring is super useful and works wonders. The photo quality is outstanding in jpeg and have not seen the raw yet. Yes the price is a bit more than a G15 or a P7700 but less than a RX100 but in my experience the XZ-2 is a better camera than all the above.[...]", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finally", "Author": "Karl Desch", "ReviewID": "R18BQCXD56VI2M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Found a camera that my mom likes!

Tarico \"DJ T\"", "ReviewID": "R2IRIF19I091U9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I selected this camera based on reviews of point and shoot cameras that performed well in low light. My primary goal was to get good photos of my daughter (todler) in all sorts of lighting conditions. The compact cameras I had were good only under ideal conditions, and my other prosumer camera is bulky and somewhat slow (though photos are still very good).  In any case, I was missing a lot of once-in-a-lifetime photos.I am a person with basic photography skills, some formal training (when photos were with film) and knowledge, and I purchased this camera as an upgrade for several other digital camera's that I have been using for some time.  For the most part have been too lazy to use the capabilities of the more sophisticated camera that I had, so I was using the point and shoot most of the time for sake of convenience. The photos were often disappointing.My other cameras were OK, but I needed something faster for good snaphots, indoor photos, kid photos,  travel scenes, and still shots in varied light conditions.  The cameras I have used include:Olympus C7070 (prosumer) - very good camera in daylight and I still use it for work photos even though it is only 7MP and nearly 10 years oldPanasonic Lumix FX-01 point and shoot pocket cameraPanasonic Lumix (?) 16MP compact long zoom point and shoot.It took a little persistence to learn the controls and features, but a little time with the advanced manual (on included CD) and it all became simple.Pros include: good photo quality indoors and out,  shoots fast, good burst mode-important for kid photos, high ISO options, good flash, excellent touch screen (like a smart phone - can scroll through photos, change setting etc.),  well placed controls.  Art modes and Scene modes are easy to use and scroll through.Cons: these are nitpicky but - GPS would be nice (I travel in remote areas), no wireless (I don't care), grip is kind of skimpy (the lens protrudes anyway. Why not make a nice, smooth, easy to hang onto, ergonomic grip like the my old Olympus had?). Can't review photos on the screen without the camera \"on\" and the lens out.I would recommend this camera to the amature  or hobbyist. Nice feature set, fun to use,  typically good photos. For me, this was a very good purchase.Paid: about $300 (Feb 2014)", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great high-end point and shoot - but you pay a premium price for it", "Author": "Leaveu", "ReviewID": "RI0MWAFZVQ834", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is very nice, image quality is very good thanks to a great lens and an improved sensor from previous version. It's a joy to hold it in your hand, the grip is a welcome addition compared to previous version. Also seems to have a very good built quality. Tilt screen is also very helpful. It's low-light capabilities are also improved with better image quality at higher ISOs compared to the XZ-1.Cons:- sensor size: if they could have increased the sensor size possibly would have got an even better camera, however most likely they would have had to change the lens as well;- price... unfortunately for Oly nowadays this is a very competitive area of the market (top pocketable or almost pocketable top) and there are several competitors with good image quality output, some of which have a larger sensor, one of them has even a faster lens, most of them are slightly more pocketable and also most are priced much better, so I think the XZ-2 is priced too high in my opinion. Also for the same price you could get a dslr or micro four thirds with a kit lens or a prime, you would win on image quality but of course you would loose on portability. If the price would be significantly better I would probably give it at least 4-4.5 stars, but otherwise I'm afraid Oly have been a bit greedy when pricing this one.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easy to Use!", "Author": "Bettye Chaplin", "ReviewID": "R22KUXIJHT6TO2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned many cameras and this was is so easy to use.
