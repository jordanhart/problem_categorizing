This camera has all of the features I was looking for in a camera: it takes excellent pictures, it's great in low-light, the menuing system is easy to navigate, and, something that I didn't even know I needed until I saw it - a screen big enough that I don't have to wear my glasses when I take a picture!  If you are of \"a certain age\" you know what a pain glasses are in regards to cameras - glasses off to see the person you are photographing - glasses on to frame them on the camera and set any menus - glasses off - glasses on, etc., etc., etc.The screen on this camera is HUGE!  And it's a touchscreen so rather than endlessly pushing arrow buttons (up, down, right, left) to move through menus then trying to remember which button to push to select (I always push the wrong one!) you simply touch the menu item, then touch your choice.  Ahhh, simplicity!In the video I try to show the basics of using the camera and a few of my favorite features.  I read the entire instruction manual and the list of things that this camera can do is really impressive, but honestly, but I'll probably never use most of them.  I just want to take decent quality photos of my friends, family and pets.I also want to be able to turn the flash off easily because I really don't like the way the flash flattens the image when shooting people (the flash tends to wash out all of the shadows and makes everything look flat and overly bright... think \"dear in the headlights\")  This camera has a feature called \"Natural Light & Flash\" which, when set, takes two photos in rapid succession every time you press the shutter: one with a flash and one without.For me this is the most brilliant and most useful feature I've ever seen on a camera! Instead of taking a shot with the flash off, looking at it, realizing that there wasn't enough light, stepping through 15 levels of menus to turn on the flash, then taking another photo, and, by now, the scene has changed and the moment is lost - now I just hit the shutter button and boom, boom the camera fires off two shots, the first without the flash and the second with.  It even shows you the two side by side on the screen after it takes them.  I love this feature!This camera addresses my three biggest concerns when buying a camera: it takes good photos, it works well in low light and the menu is drop-dead simple to navigate.  But it also slam-dunks two requirements that I didn't even know I had until I used it: a screen big enough to see without my glasses and the ability to shoot a flash/no flash sequence every time I take a photo.  My standards have officially been raised.I've already recommended the Fujifilm Finepix Z700EXR to a couple of friends who, when they saw the screen on this thing didn't want to give it back!  But this one's mine, get your own.Update- 06-12-10I've had the time to use the camera a lot more and have found that the \"Natural Light & Flash\" feature, though really quite wonderful, also slows the camera's recovery time between shots significantly.  If you are going to be taking a lot of shots, say at a party, you might want to take the first one in this mode, then see which looks best, with or without the flash, then turn off the Natural Light & Flash and take the rest of your shots in the flash/no flash mode that looked best.I hope this video-review helps,ClairePS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it's just to say, Hi!\") feel free to post it below.", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Terrific pictures, but the touch-screen annoys me just a little", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "R36D9UMHOC74IR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having owned 3 different models of the Z-Series Fuji camera, I feel so fortunate to be able to review this top-of-the-line Z700 EXR.  I'm a camera buff; I have purchased ten Fuji's since 2003 and have never been let down by any of them.  (My oldest, a 2MP A205, still works).I love the Z700's metal construction. I have the red, it's a true red with no pink tones, so it should appeal to either gender. The tripod mount is located center bottom, so you can use a mini-tripod without it tipping over. I'm fairly certain the silver parts are plastic, but the main camera body is metal.What's in the box?  The camera, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, battery charger, USB cable, software CD, basic instruction manual and hand strap.  The manual is 23 pages in the English version, and also comes with French and Spanish manuals.  The full manual is on the CD.The lens is protected by a sliding cover which also powers the camera on and off. The lens (5X optical) zooms in and out INSIDE the camera, so you don't have to be as careful when you handle it. Unless you drop the camera you probably won't get a zoom error that commonly happens with cameras where the lens protrudes outward when powered up and you accidentally bump it into something.One thing I like better about this Z700 than some of the older Z series is the USB connector is not located inside the battery compartment, it's on the side of the camera, behind a door.  The battery compartment door (on the bottom) appears to be well-made.On previous Z cameras the buttons were too close and it was easy to press the incorrect one.  I don't have that problem here as everything is done by touch-screen.  At the same time I'm a little skeptical that the screen will work years from now.  It's a whopping big 3.5 inches, biggest I've seen so far, but it has to be large due to the \"buttons\" being on the LCD.  In any event, once you get used to using it, all the symbols for the functions look similar to what you'd see on a conventional digital camera.  A light touch is all that is needed to choose your settings.The default is the EXR Auto mode - this is similar as the SR Auto (scene recognition) mode on less expensive Fuji's.  The sensor is supposed to discern what you are taking a picture of:  Portrait, Landscape, Night, Macro, Backlit Portrait, or Night Portrait.  In addition to choosing the scene, it also decides which EXR mode to use automatically. Sometimes the pictures turn out better if I choose the mode myself instead of letting the camera do it automatically.  Just tap over to either of the 3 EXR shooting modes:  HR, SN, or DR, because the camera doesn't always choose the correct scene if used in EXR AUTO (it messes up approximately 5% of the time, not that big a deal, but still....).  I haven't been lucky with the SN setting - so far SN has resulted in grainy pictures, I guess practice makes perfect with this setting.  (HR is high resolution, SN stands for sensitivity/low noise, and DR stands for dynamic range).Recovery time after taking a picture without using the flash was under a second; recovery time between pictures with the flash firing was under 2 seconds before the camera was ready to take another shot...this was faster than other cameras I've used recently. Recovery time also depends on the class of your SD card.This camera has OPTICAL Image Stabilization, accomplished by CCD sensor-shift technology.  As far as manual settings, the settings are: ISO, white balance,  exposure compensation, size, quality (normal/fine), D-range, and film simulation.So far I've shot over 100 pictures and some short movies and the battery is still fully charged.  The charger is included and you can fully charge the battery in a little over an hour. I prefer lithium batteries over AA's as they make the camera lighter in weight. You just have to plan ahead in case you are going somewhere so you have a fully charged battery, or buy a spare.  Speaking of camera weight, the Z700 is slightly heavier than other compact cameras, due to it being metal.Being a pet owner, my favorite feature is the Pet Recognition.  It can recognize the facial features of many dog and cat breeds to optimize the focus.  My cats are mixed breeds and they were recognized too.  However, it will not recognize Persians with smooshed-up faces. I've noticed that when used in the cat (or dog) mode, the camera tends to focus on the face, and not the rest of the body.  Works better as a \"portrait\" shot.  If I'm photographing the entire body, it works better on EXR Auto.There are two movie selections - HD and 640 in the AVI format. The HD video quality is better than my Flip Mino HD camcorder. Optical zoom needs to be set before recording starts, it cannot be changed after the button is pushed. Focus is also set when recording begins, but exposure and white balance are constantly adjusting during the recording.Playing movies on your TV requires an optional A/V cable. Playing HD movies requires an optional HDMI cable. There is also a Model HDP-L1 player available on Fujifilm's web site, which includes an HD card reader and a remote. Since I don't have an HDTV, I didn't purchase this so I can't comment on it.This camera comes with Fuji photo editing software (not a favorite of mine). It's compatible with Windows 7, Vista, XP and Mac. The software is not as good as Picasa, so I don't use it.  I never edit my photos while in the camera, it's easier to use the computer for this.This camera has 30 MB of internal memory, so pick up an SD card with a minimum Class 4 speed.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>THINGS I DON'T LIKE:1.  The screen shows fingerprints so I'm constantly wiping it off with a cloth.  I hate dirty screens!2.  One thing I did not expect is that the touchscreen (and the entire camera) gets very warm if you have it turned on for an extended period of time - 10 minutes or so is all it took for mine to heat up - which wouldn't be an unusually long period of time if you are taking lots of pictures.  I am not sure if the camera could overheat, but it's something to keep in mind.3.  Due to practically the entire back of the camera being a touch-screen, there's not much area to grasp the camera.  I find myself carefully holding the top and bottom.  And I ruined a lot of pictures in the beginning with my fingers getting in the way of the lens.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>WHO WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA FOR?  Not a young child because of the touch-screen - easily broken and this camera isn't cheap.  Not for grandma or grandpa either unless they are somewhat comfortable with digital cameras already.  For everyone else:  Go for it!  It's a cool-looking camera that takes really great pictures. I would definitely choose another Fuji with the Super CCD EXR. Would I buy another touch-screen?  I'm not sure at this point.  It will depend on how long this one lasts before it gives me trouble.  I hope it never does.  To be honest, I didn't much care for the touch-screen at first, but it's growing on me.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>NOTE:  If you need a camera case, this one is perfect for the Z700EXR and it has enough room to carry an extra battery and SD card. Lowepro Volta 20 Camera Case (Black)", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "A solid evolution to a line of lookers", "Author": "THATCH \"RST\"", "ReviewID": "R3MGJ77I8GUPO0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been into small pocket sized Fuji cameras since the Z1 (the beginning).  I've had a few of them since then, and never once have I had a hardware failure or electronics malfunction with a Fuji. They're made of metal, they're durable and they're stylish. This review will be more of a conversation about the camera and its performance instead of a bullet list of features.This model has a touch screen, which was new for me in a Fuji. I found that taking pictures was very easy, the portability and how much grip I could hold on the camera was excellent, and the picture quality was good, but I have a few scenarios I'm going to continue testing. The touch screen is a pleasure to use compared to the touch screen I used on the Nikon S70. The interface on the touch screen is also far superior to the S70 Nikon in my opinion, plus it just feels more durable on this Fuji.I attached some photos for you to take a look at that were taken with the camera-- some text under macro mode in low lighting (excellent), an outdoor photo of a brick building (very good), and an indoor photo of a living room (less good).  The camera has done excellent for me in all scenarios but indoor photos were the least desirable in my opinion. They had some lack of focus, which after some testing seemed to be because I had facial recognition turned on, but there were no faces to recognize. I'm going to do some more testing with this to be sure.The camera is easy to grip, but if you're trying to grip it with one hand and take photos while doing something with the other hand, it may take some adjustment. The adjustment comes in the fact that the screen is so big on the back that I've found myself pressing buttons when I didn't mean to, changing settings on the camera. I think this will just be an issue needing my awareness on how to hold the camera, and when the normal two hands are involved there is no issue. I suspect the grip issue is going to exist on any small camera with a touch screen while trying to use one hand.Fuji has been quick to move some of their higher end features into this tiny pocket sized model. I also have the Fuji HS10, which I absolutely love, but which is far larger and more complicated than this camera-- but some of the nice features have quickly trickled down such as the facial recognition, image stabilization and capturing HD movies.It may seem like a small thing, but one of my favorite improvements over the years and coming with this camera is that the battery charger plugs directly into the wall instead of having a power cable on it.  It's the thought put into that which make a difference for me when travelling with a tiny camera.The camera has a myriad of custom settings and specialized shooting modes if you're into that, and if you want to leave it in auto mode, that worked just as well for me. I enjoy the natural lighting mode, sepia and black & white simulation modes.If you are looking for a pocket sized powerhouse that is also stylish and durable, this may be the camera for you. I have never had a Fuji let me down, and so far this one seems to be no different.I hope to keep updating this review as I get to spend more time with the camera.", "Date": "May 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Review for those who aren't good with high tech gadgets", "Author": "Margaret Thomas \"tygerkittn\"", "ReviewID": "R2TB71N70B2WWR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This takes really great pictures! Or maybe I just have beautiful kids!...Nah, it's the camera. Seriously, I didn't want to just give it five stars, I sat and thought about possible drawbacks, but I haven't found any. My last digital camera was something like 3 megapixels, and the telephoto lens thingy got stuck and never got unstuck. That will never happen with this one, and the pictures are so sharp, and so beautiful, and I love the touchscreen controls.I had a little trouble with the menu, but I'm not good with high tech devices, I buy cell phones that don't do anything but make phone calls because I can't handle the camera and other add ons. I did figure it out, which means it must be really easy!It comes with a large 4 gig SD card, it's easy to charge, it holds the charge a long time, I love the battery life, I haven't tested it with a vacation yet, but based on how often I've had to recharge I think it will be just fine.  It's easy to load the pictures on the computer, I never even installed the software that came with it.It's easy to use, even I figured it out, and I have been very unenthusiastic about digital cameras, I still keep my film camera in easy reach, but it's getting less and less use now. The digital revolution finally embroiled me and forced me to take sides, and I have to admit, the freedom of not using film is exhilarating.I really like this camera. I'm not worthy of it, I don't know what I'm doing, I can't give one of those technical reviews, (except turn the little flat knob on the ring around the button on top right or left for telephoto or wide angle. It's counterintuitive, but that's how it works, and if it's in the wrong mode, hit the other button on top and it switches.)but it works in spite of me. I have taken some fantastic pictures.I dreaded reviewing this, because I like it so much I sound sycophantic, but it would be unfair NOT to review it just because I like it a lot and can't find anything negative to say, no matter how I try.It must be pretty sturdy, because it's held up to family use, we've had it for weeks and had no problems of any sort, even though it's been dropped (hear that, Nikon? Find out what fuji is doing right!) My husband's Nikon didn't survive a small fall onto carpet, but this has been dropped outside and it's fine.Finally, it's red, I always secretly wanted a bright red digital camera. It's easier to keep track of because of that, and it looks very sharp and stylish.So that is a totally non-technical review, from someone who is terrified of menus and buttons and gadgets. If you're like me, don't be scared, it's very easy, and if you have problems, find a small child to help you. That's what I do.", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "I LOVE this camera!", "Author": "Diane Kistner", "ReviewID": "R2CLD4DONU0TVK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am writing this review as a decidedly amateur, sporadic digital photographer. Several years ago, my sister gave me her old Nikon Coolpix 880 (state of the art in 2000) and I had a lot of trouble making myself use it. The pictures she took with it looked so much better than mine, largely because I never could hold the camera stable enough to get good shots. I was also bad about forgetting to take off the lens cover and the lens would strain against it, trying to shwoop out. The Nikon was so big and unwieldy that I just rarely bothered to take it anywhere with me. I'd use it to batch-shoot a bunch of things to put up for sale on eBay or Craig's List when I decided to clear things out, but that was the extent of my photographic exploits. I may have taken 30 photographs the whole time I had it. Let's just say that I did not enjoy digital photography.So it was sheer delight to get my hands on the FinePix Z700EXR! It's about the size of a deck of cards with a detachable wrist strap so you can \"wear it with you\" and not leave it lying on a table somewhere by mistake. There are no lens mishaps to worry about, because the camera is off when the sliding lens cover is closed (unless in the handy closed-cover playback mode) and turns on when the cover is slid open; the lens itself stays in the camera and doesn't poke out. Your choice of auto-off mode can be set in seconds, and if you're actively shooting you can disable auto-off. That's really helpful.When you first get the camera, you'll need to charge the battery. I love how tidy the battery charger is; it plugs directly into the wall outlet. Be sure to follow the insertion instructions for the battery. And whatever you do, don't put the memory card in backwards like I did. (I couldn't tell how it was meant to go in, so I had it turned around so the little notches were facing toward the battery. I thought I would NEVER get that card out! Once I did, and I put it in correctly, it was very easy to pop it in and out.)The camera's view window takes up one full side, and all the camera's settings are touch-accessible/settable right on the screen, beckoning you to explore what the camera can do. You can toggle the settings icons on and off with a touch of the DISP button. There are many settings I know a knowledgeable photographer would use (film-type emulation, the various non-auto modes, etc.) but I don't know enough yet to evaluate how well they work. I plan to experiment with the FinePix's capabilities by taking the same shot several different ways and comparing the photos with the handy compare tool. This feature facilitates taking reference shots so the more fussy among us can ensure they get the perfect shot. For me, it will be a great way, while playing, to learn the finer points of digital photography\u2014almost like having a hands-on photography course right there in my camera!The FinePix Z700EXR does an excellent job of stabilizing shots. The first day I used it, we were traveling about 55 mph along a small-town/country road, and I was just holding the camera (in auto-flash/focus mode with the screen-touch shooting capability turned on) and tapping it indiscriminately as we rode along, not even looking at the view screen. I was very surprised at how well a lot of the pictures turned out. Perhaps 10% of them were blurred; the rest had sharp points of focus with the background looking great. I did get my thumb in some of them until I realized I could just hold the camera with my fingers along the bottom back of the camera, over the slid-back lens cap, instead of trying to daintily dot my non-dainty fingertips around the edges.The most amazing thing to me is that I can frame a shot, tap the point of focus wherever it is in the shot (somebody's face, or a bug on a leaf) and the Z700EXR does its magic to set up the shot for me. I can zoom in easily and get very detailed shots of bugs I find in my garden, then go in and look them up in Garden Insects of North America to find out if they are good or bad before I kill them. I can pinpoint the finer details of the various blights and spots, then investigate online so I'll know exactly how to deal with them. The FinePix Z700EXR: Best. Garden. Tool. Ever.So far, I haven't played around much with the camera's editing and social network-tagging features, but they are there. For now, I've just been renaming and editing the photos with Picasa or Photoshop and uploading them to Facebook using Facebook's tools. Because I design book covers and do production and editorial work for FutureCycle Press (poetry), I'm taking all my shots in Fine mode and resizing/watermarking them using FastStone Image Viewer before putting them on the web because there's no telling when I might want to clip a portion of an original photo out to use in a design. For most people, the Normal setting is probably just fine and takes up far less memory.I have nothing but warm and fuzzy feelings for Fujifilm for giving me the opportunity to review this awesome camera. I might actually turn into one of those people who is really \"into\" digital photography.", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Eh, it's ok", "Author": "A. Albright", "ReviewID": "R3OU3HLOD79OK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We have had digital cameras with the elongating lenses, which we have found to be too sensitive and break easily (one was a Fujifilm, and the other was a Canon). So this time, we wanted a little guy that didn't have a lens that moved in and out to avoid breakage. Since we had owned a Fujifilm camera in the past that took, in our opinion, some of the best pictures we've had yet from a point-and-shoot, we decided to try another one.This one, while being a nice flat, pocket camera, is only ok. First, let's talk about this EXR technology. Fujifilm wants to to think this EXR technology is super great, and, well, it can be, but you have to know what you're doing. The camera allows you to select one of three EXR shooting modes: HR for resolution priority, SN for minimal noise (for nighttime photos this would be best), and DR for D-range priority (as it tells you in the menu, this is for \"preventing washout and captures tonality in bright scenes\"). There is also an option to have the camera automatically select which one of these you use, but so far from my experience, the camera doesn't \"choose wisely,\" particularly in ambiguous lighting situations. I've uploaded a cropped photo I took where the camera was on EXR auto, and you can see a lot of noise and loss of sharpness. In contrast, I've uploaded a few shots where I specifically selected HR, and when I did, it made a world of difference. Likewise, when taking photos inside during the day, I find putting the camera in \"natural light\" mode is the best. So in summation, it can take fine photos, but to get the most out of the shots, make sure you put it in the appropriate mode. This, to me, kinda detracts from its value since what we were really looking for here is a simple point-and-shoot that didn't require fidgeting beforehand in order to get good shots.Additionally, Fujifilm says you can use your finger and push on the part of the screen on the back to focus and take the picture. It works only ok. While there's an expected delay between you pushing on the screen and the photo being taken, it just doesn't do a great, consistent job of it. Thankfully, there is a button on the top of the camera that lets you take photos, so this problem isn't too much of a problem at all.Overall, the Z700EXR isn't a bad pocket camera, but maybe there's a better one out there. I don't know if there is, but I'd probably do more research if I were buying again.", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Overall good performer, small size, unique lens system", "Author": "Jerry Saperstein", "ReviewID": "R3MLFME951ONSV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Fujifilm Finepix Z700EXR must is unique enough to merit being evaluated on its own features and not compared to other cameras. This is a diminutive point `n shoot  that fits easily in any pocket. It is small, thin and light. The camera's front has two unique features: sliding a panel up and down turns the camera off and the 5X optical zoom lens does not extend outward. It is a pretty slick system with a couple of drawbacks. The camera is so small that you have to remember to hold its left-side by the edges, lest you get your fingers in front of the lens. Until you get into the habit of doing that, which doesn't take long, you'll also find that the flush lens face attracts finger oils like a magnet. Depending on how much oil you secrete, it doesn't take much to cover the lens with your own body oil, which acts a diffuser and makes your pictures appear to be out of focus. You definitely want to keep a microfiber cloth with you. This camera requires frequent cleaning not only of the lens, but of the 3.5 inch touch screen on the back. The camera has only three physical controls. The front plate, which slides up and down to turn the camera on and off. A shutter button combined with the zoom control and another top-mounted control to switch between camera functions and playback. A small door on the side hides a USB port. There is a tripod screw on the bottom mounted almost in the center. The sensor is described as a 12 Megapixel  \"1/2-inch Super honeycomb EXR CCD with primary color filter\". In theory, this design should give you more detail and better color rendition. I have no means other than my eye to validate any such claims in detail, so I'll just say that the images are nice. The 3.5\" touch screen is where all the real camera controls are located. In both camera and playback mode, a row of icons on either side of the screen let you choose a variety of functions by touch. These include eight exposure modes, flash, auto-timer, macro mode, a menu button, face recognition switch, display mode and playback. Interestingly the screen touch button make some forms of camera control quick and easy. Choosing the camera mode is a straight forward process: press the main mode button and then choose the desired mode. There are four EXR modes which are supposed to be full auto modes sort of on steroids. There's a full auto EXR mode which is for those who don't want to make any decisions, a resolution priority mode or optimizing detail, a high ISO and low noise setting which is supposed to minimize noise in lo light shots and what they call a \"D-range\" mode that is supposed to keep highlights from blowing out. In practice, the EXR Auto mode simply lets the camera make all the decisions. I personally prefer more direct control and used the Auto setting which the camera manual suggests using in most situations. You can set the maximum ISO to be used in this mode, which is quite handy. There's a somewhat gimmicky, but still useful \"touch `n shoot\" that allows you to touch the subject you want your primary focus on with your fingertip and the camera determines focus and exposure on that object. It is clumsy in some ways, but my prove useful in certain situations. The Scene Position mode provides 15 presets for backlit situations, portraits, landscapes and so on. There is also a very unique pet recognition mode that promises to recognize dogs and cats. I didn't test that one, but I am sure many people will. There's a Natural Light mode that promises to optimize exposure and ISO for natural light photos and it works well. There is also a natural light with flash option that takes two photos, one without flash and one with. It works well. There is also  Manual Exposure mode, but there is nothing in the manual about setting shutter and aperture independently in this mode. I haven't figured this one out yet.Finally there is Movie mode. The 720p resolution from this camera is gorgeous. You can't zoom while using this option. You can also take 640 x 480 videos. The built-in microphone worked  reasonably well. Overall, image quality was pretty good with excellent color saturation and few blown highlights in the sunny summer day outdoors shots I took. I felt that the noise at all ISO levels was a little higher than I am accustomed to in higher end point `n shoots like this one, but that is a personal opinion. On the whole, this is a more than adequate point `n shoot camera. The non-extending lens is a major plus factor. The 5X optical zoom with optical stabilization is more than competent. Flash range is pretty good. The 35mm lens equivalent is 35 - 175mm. However, the lens at wide angle seemed to be wider than 35mm. Macro mode runs from about four inches, which is excellent. SDHC cards up to 32GB may be used. Playback options are many and some are kind of fun, like the gesture control of moving from one image to another. There is a cropping capability along with  a collage feature. All in all, this is a fully featured point `n shoot in  a very small, unobtrusive package. The non-extending lens is a major plus factor. Start up is a bit on the slow side, though shutter lag is pretty short. The only drawbacks I find worth mentioning are that the lens is easily smeared with finger oils and the lens tends to flare when shooting toward the Sun. This can actually be used to good creative effect, such as posing someone in front of a bush with the sun filtering through. The flare adds a nice touch, but you have to compose your scenes carefully. The weakest point of the camera is battery life. The manufacturer says 170 shots - I haven't gotten more than 100. However batteries for this are inexpensive, so just get a spare or two.Overall, this a very stylish and competent point `n shoot. It now has a place in my pocket whenever I go out.

Generous 5x Zoom range, very sharp, clear images.  Very little chromatic aberration (\"purple fringing\").--  Extremely compact, good build quality, well thought out design.--  Nice looking camera, stylish design, clever engineering.--  Includes a printed manual, an excellent battery and charger, USB cable, etc.--  Uses the widely available, inexpensive SD/SDHC memory cards.--  Excellent *natural* color (not \"juiced\" up like many P&S; cams).--  Great Macro Mode!  Easy to use and works well.--  The touchscreen interface actually works very well.--  Has features enthusiast photographers will love (thinking is rewarded).--  Fairly powerful flash (for a built-in).--  Best suited for the enthusiast (in my opinion), more range and capabilities than the average compact camera.Cons:--  Extremely compact - easy to get fingers in the way of lens and flash, but you'll learn. ;)--  No viewfinder.  Sadly becoming the norm.  (I find it much easier to frame and focus using a viewfinder.)--  Lots of noise in high ISO images (but same for every other compact P&S;). At least you get the shot (and have a choice).--  Might take a bit more thought than some other compact cameras (but worth it in my opinion)First off, I am going on a trip tomorrow and had planned to take my long-time favorite compact (another brand) which I truly love, but after using this, I feel confident enough in it to take it with me instead.  It has already proven that it is quite capable of excellent images.  Also, although I was a bit skeptical of the touch screen interface, as it turns out, it actually works quite well and is easy to use.This is a *very* small camera, about the size of a deck of cards.  It has a high rez 3.5\" LCD touch screen that takes up the entire rear of the camera.  It seemed bright enough to me and I had no issues using it in bright light outdoors.  The camera uses Fuji's exclusive EXR Super CCD sensor technology.  Fuji has been going their own way for many years with this tech and I have had earlier Fuji cameras using earlier generations of this sensor and it does have it's special strengths.  The EXR bit is some new tech Fuji has been employing recently.  It used to be camera makers made a choice and you had to live with it.  Fuji got smart and now they let you make the choice.  You can choose whether high resolution, wide dynamic range, or high sensitivity and low noise (relatively speaking), are the most important for the scene you are shooting.  This is a nice development that gives a compact camera more control and is a welcome advancement for enthusiasts.  Of course, they still include the more usual scene and auto modes, and a manual mode for even more control.  All in all, much more advanced than your average compact point and shoot.  The Z700 also includes dual image stabilization and a generous 5X Optical Zoom lens that's a \"periscope\" design which stays internal to the body rather than poking in and out while zooming.  And the Z700 can even shoot HD (720p) video (though it won't replace a proper HD Video Cam by any means).I was surprised at how quickly I adapted to this ultra-compact power house.  I skimmed over the basic printed manual (nice), but really, you can just pick this cam up and figure most everything out fairly quickly.  I had a lot of reservations about the touch screen interface.  I love my big SLR's with buttons galore!  However, I actually found it nice, easy to use, and fairly intuitive.  Although I still prefer using a viewfinder for composition and focusing, I'm somewhat resigned to the fact that they are gone forever on these new compacts.  The fairly large LCD screen helps in this regard, making it easier to see details.  I did not have any problems and was soon snapping merrily away.  The quality of the images is great.  Especially outdoors and in good light.  They put a serious little lens on this thing, it's a marvel.  The macro mode is superb.  The clarity, sharp details, and natural color got my attention right away.  Focusing was quick and accurate.  The camera was very responsive.  The image stabilization works well. I was excited to see how capable this little camera is.  The natural colors and the great lens make a winning combination.  If you are an enthusiast and are serious about photography, you'll be impressed.I have not used the more glitzy stuff much (face recognition, image tagging, etc.) or the video modes -- I'm more interested in image quality and serious photo capabilities, and the Z700 looks like a contender to me in those areas.  I will continue to shoot with it and will come back and update this review as I have more experience with this fine camera.At the original price, it was a great value, at the new lower prices being offered, it's a superb choice.  One of the more exciting models in this price range for sure.", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Point-And-Shoot And So Much More!", "Author": "K.

It comes with a 3.5\" LCD wide screen with touch screen capabilities.  It also has an internal 5X optical zoom lens, video capabilities, and 12 megapixel resolution for clear photos.  Other features include multi-shot capabilities, numerous photo-taking options, and face/pet recognition.While that's all pretty standard for many similar cameras, Fujifilm goes the extra step by loading up this camera with a ton of features and makes them easy to use as well.  One of my favorite features is a with/without flash feature that allows you to take two photos in quick succession, one in natural light and the other with flash, and then have the opportunity to view both on a split screen.  You can then delete one or both pics or save them for later.  You can also turn on an anti-jitter feature that helps prevent blurred photos.  Another nice feature is a slideshow option that lets you view pictures while music quietly plays in the background.  There are a number of other features which you may or may not use, including a feature similar to Kodak's Easyshare button that allows you to quickly download photos to Facebook.Overall use of these features and the accompanying software is relatively easy.  Before even looking at the basic manual, I was able to pick up on a number of the camera's features.  I took a few test shots at home with the family and then took the camera on the road with us as we spent a weekend together in town.  The biggest test so far came during a local science fiction convention where I had the chance to take photos of costumes that ranged from dark-colored Klingons to bright red, white, and blue Captain America.  No matter what the setting, the pictures came out very good.If I have any complaints about this camera, they would have to be the location of lens and the auto shooting mode feature.  The lens is right where you'd normally place your fingers while taking a basic photo.  It took a little time to get used to pulling back my fingers to keep it from getting in the photo.  The auto mode had a tendency to overuse the flash, resulting in some pretty bright photos that would have otherwise looked great in natural lighting.The camera is packaged with a rechargeable battery that remains charged for a very long time.  It also comes with a battery charger, software, a USB cable to connect to your computer, and a basic owner's manual.It has a sleek look to it and can easily fit into your pocket.  I do recommend purchasing a case for the camera in order to product the view screen.

It has a slider cover that serves as lens protector as well as the on and off button.  The first thing to setup is the language, date and time, which is simple and easy.  After that, if you have any experience using a digital camera, you are pretty much set in taking your pictures out of the box.  The first thing to note is that it has the wow factor that you can pretty much shoot, focus, and set the proper exposure by merely using the LCD touchscreen.  Hold the camera, compose, touch your subject on the screen and it will shoot a picture without using the shutter button. Impressive!  Well, nice to have an option, but then in the end, your normal trigger finger is still looking for the usual shutter feel when it comes to cheesy times.  Fuji is well known to take better pictures in low lighting situations and the Z700 is no exception.  ISO can be set up to 3200.LCD.This camera has a 3.5 inches touch screen widescreen LCD - it is huge. I mean huge!  The glass covers the entire back of the camera. Unfortunately, that's the trade off - no viewfinder. It also has an accelerometer similar to the iPod where the image automatically shifts to portrait or landscape depending on how you hold the camera.  You can advance or check the previous photos by sliding your finger forward or back.  The only thing missing is the pinch for zooming in and out of an image.ZOOM:Zoom is 5x optical.HIGH DEFINITION MOVIE:This camera is capable of shooting 1280 x 720 high def movie (in AVI format).  I was pretty excited to try this function as I was hoping with a bigger lens will have better quality than my Flip HD video camera.  Not so, it is quite good on outdoor scenes, but very disappointing in indoor performance.  Result is very grainy in dim light situations.  It also cannot zoom during video shoots.  Mono.  30 frames/sec.  You won't be able to play your HD to your TV directly from the camera.  The camera does not have an HDMI port.  Instead, Fuji has the Fujifilm HDP-L1 HD Player and Remote as an accessory where you can put the SD card and connect to HDTV via HDMI.CHARGER:The included charger is rated for 100-240V, 50/60 Hz, which makes it a great portable travel charger.  Not only it can accommodate the NP-45A battery which this camera uses, it also can charge another type of battery - the NP-50.  Output is 4.2V at 550 mA.  It is very light and is equipped with a folding retractable prongs for easy storage.

You can have up to an 8G SDHC memory card.  The camera has a 30MB (6 photos if you shoot in max resolution) internal memory built-in, but pretty limited in capacity.VERDICT:Overall, the camera takes wonderful photos.  It has tons of presets for every imaginable shooting situation.  You just have to pick the right setting and you'll almost certainly be satisfied.  So small, but feature packed.

Its metal body gives the camera more of a solid heft than many other ones, especially compared to similar Sony, Canon, Olympus, and Kodak digital cameras I have used.  I'm really enjoying it and am grateful to be able to review it.In the box with the camera, you get a rechargeable Li-Ion battery, charging dock (with flip-out prongs that attach the dock directly to the electrical outlet), USB cable, wrist cord, brief setup/instruction manual, and a CD with Fuji's photo software and the complete user manual.  (The manual on the CD comes in 22 languages, and the camera itself will operate in 27 languages.  Your Armenian-born great aunt will be pleased to know that she can not only read the manual but operate the camera, too.)  Note that you will have to buy an SD card separately.To turn the camera on/off, you slide the front panel down/up.  Looking at it from the front, the lens is located in the upper right corner, so it's protected by the sliding panel when the camera is off.  The battery and memory card slide into adjacent slots on the bottom of the camera, protected by a plastic but very stable door with a solid springed hinge.  Next to the battery/memory card door is the tripod mount.The camera features an automatic light- and focus-adjusting mode called Super CCD EXR Auto.  This option allows the camera to select the settings (flash, tonality, range, detail) for each scene.  Other EXR modes include High Resolution (for highly detailed shots), High ISO/Low Noise (for clear shots), and Dynamic-Range Priority (for bright, tonal scenes that would otherwise look washed out).  In addition to the EXR modes, the camera features separate modes for portraits (rich tones and smooth tones), landscapes, action/sports, night landscapes, night still shots (for use with a tripod), fireworks, sunsets, snowy shots, beach shots, indoor events, flowers, page text, dogs, and cats.The lens zooms inside the body of the camera, so it doesn't protrude out for a telescopic shot.  The zoom control feature is a toggle ring around the shutter button; I much prefer this to a separate zoom button because it's where your finger is already positioned, and it saves space.  You can adjust the focus and exposure on any setting by pressing the shutter button halfway down.  It also recognizes faces (and pets too!); automatically reduces/removes red eye; and shoots in color, B/W, and sepia.  One additional feature I like is that I can adjust for time zone differences without changing the original set date/time -- great for vacations and traveling.The touch screen is huge: 3.5\" x 2\" (so it's widescreen), and displays in super high resolution.  I don't know if it qualifies as HD, but it sure looks like it.  The display will auto-rotate (just like an iPhone) depending on which way you hold the camera.  I both love and dislike the touch screen:  It's so fun, and it feels much more interactive than my other digital cameras; but sometimes I accidentally press buttons, and the screen gets greasy/dirty quickly.  Overall, though, the pros outweigh the cons, and I would say that I prefer the touch screen to physical buttons.So what about the shots?  They're crisp and detailed, with vivid colors and fantastic dark/light contrast, thanks in no small part to the 12 megapixel resolution.  Inside shots are clear, outside shots are bright and tonal, portraits are beautifully detailed.  Over the past few days, I have taken about 70 photos and several videos, inside and outside, and my battery still shows a full charge.  I absolutely love how simple it is to charge: you remove the battery from the camera and slide it into the slim wall charger.  When I got the camera, it took about an hour to charge the depleted battery to full capacity.I have just a few gripes with this camera, but they're pretty minor.  The first is the lens location.  I'm not accustomed to my lens being in the upper corner, so a sliver of my finger got in the way of many of my first shots.  Why Fuji couldn't have reversed the positions of the lens and the flash (putting the lens near the middle and the flash in the corner), I don't know.  I do have to make a concerted effort to ensure that my finger is not partially blocking the lens.  My second gripe is how quickly the touch screen gets greasy/dirty.  It would be great if Fuji had included a little microfiber cleaning cloth.  My last gripe is that the only place you can hold onto the camera is on the edges, due to the lens placement and the fact that the touch screen that takes up the entire back of the camera.Cool things you can do with this camera that I wasn't expecting:- Scroll through your pictures by sliding your finger across the screen.- Take movies in either HD or 640p.  (The sound quality is just okay.)- Tag photos and videos for quick and painless uploading to Facebook or YouTube.- Compare two pictures side-by-side while still being able to scroll.- Crop and resize photos (saved as new) before uploading them.Overall, I absolutely love this hot little camera and am so grateful for the opportunity to review it.

The surface of the camera is high-gloss, doesn't pick up normal fingerprints, and seems a bit scratch-resistant. The door for the battery and memory card compartment doesn't close as cleanly as I would prefer, so this worries me. There's a second door which conceals the USB connection, but you'll need to open the battery cover every time you want to charge the battery. However, the door that hides the USB port is only secured with a strip of plastic and could easily break off and get lost. The camera also seems heavier than most others that I've used.Touchscreen: This camera has a touchscreen with no buttons to control menu functions - everything is done via the touchscreen. The screen is large and bright. When using the camera, the image is surrounded on the left and right edges by options - so the image doesn't fill the entire screen while shooting pictures. The touchscreen is somewhat responsive, although this isn't the type of touchscreen you'd find on your phone or music device - you need to apply just a bit of pressure to activate sections of the screen. In other words, it senses pressure, and not the static charge of your finger. There's an orientation sensor in the camera that will sense which way you are holding the camera - landscape of portrait - and it will rotate the menu options right-side-up accordingly. I've noticed, however, that the screen is very fingerprint-prone. I'd also call the touchscreen a bit \"bouncy\" when you touch it. It's not like touching glass, it's like touching a plastic sheet.It probably goes without saying, but this camera deserves a case to protect it, especially the touchscreen.Functionality:To turn the camera on, you have to pull the protective door...\"down\". This is really counter-intuitive, since it's not the way your hands work when you're holding a camera - it's much easier to pull a sliding door to the left or right. Once you do this, it takes at least 4 seconds for the device to be ready to take a picture. As soon as the image appears on the screen, you can press the shutter release and take a picture within 2-3 seconds. If you leave the camera on \"Auto\", then it's almost \"ready-to-go\". The camera will automatically shut-down after a few minutes, and it's not easy to restart it quickly.The lens is at the upper-left (when holding the camera). There's no indentation that prevents your fingers from getting in the way. I've had several shots that included the edge of my fingers. In other words, you have to hold this camera \"just right\" to keep your fingers out of the image. There's no independent viewfinder, so you must do everything through the display.The menu system is simple. Common functions are available while taking pictures. Some options, however, are buried at least two or three levels below the top level, so it's not always quick to get to the setting you need. There is a general setup menu that allows you to choose global settings such as screen brightness, sound levels, etc.Image Quality:In auto-mode, you can definitely see the camera working. It will actively compensate for differences in lighting and will choose an appropriate flash setting. You can, of course, override everything and select specific shooting modes. The camera seems to perform fairly well in low-light situations, but still is incapable of capturing distant objects in dark settings. In other words, you won't be able to sit in the middle of the auditorium and capture your child during a recital.One particularly glaring obstacle is how the camera decides to auto-focus while using \"zoom\". If you center on an object, then zoom-in, the image goes incredibly out-of-focus until you are done zooming and re-center on the object. Unfortunately, it's very easy to lose the subject when this happens.12 megapixels really makes a difference. This camera not only features 12 megapixels, but it also has an \"EXR\" mode which forces the camera to give priority over resolution and noise reduction. All of this is very apparent. I've never been easily impressed with higher-megapixel numbers, but this camera has convinced me otherwise. For example, if I take a picture from across the room of my DVR, and I use the camera's editing features to crop a very small region of image, I can clearly discern the very tiny print on the control buttons of my DVR. What does this mean? Well, if you take pictures without using \"zoom\", you can edit the pictures yourself and zoom-in (crop) without losing any quality. I've been quite impressed with what I can do ON the camera without using a PC.\"Natural light\" pictures are some of the best I've ever taken with this camera. I prefer images without flash, but even when you use the flash, this camera doesn't saturate the image with a ghastly-white glow. In general, the camera does a very good job at detecting lighting levels and compensating accordingly.Videos can be recorded in high-definition. Unfortunately, the focus becomes \"fixed focus\" and you also cannot use the zoom functionality. High-definition capability aside, I feel like the video recording is very \"casual\" in nature and isn't meant as a substitute for a separate video recording device.Battery-life: Battery life is average. The camera uses a proprietary Fuji battery, so if you are traveling and need a \"spare\", you'll need to buy one. The battery must be removed from the camera to be charged in an included wall-charger. You can probably expect to use the camera substantially over the course of a day before requiring a charge. Unfortunately, the battery-level indicator on the camera only has three bars, and it seems once it get to the \"middle\" bar, it heads downward very quickly. It doesn't do a very good job at warning you when the battery is starting to drain. Using higher functions (EXR, flash, face-detection, zoom) only drains the battery even faster. It would be nice if the battery charge indicator had more segments so you could better determine remaining charge. When it turns red, you don't know if you can take 5 more pictures or 100, for example.Overall, I'm very pleased with this camera. I like how it's constructed, and I especially like the touchscreen. The image quality is superb. Unfortunately, everything related to the battery - from the door to the indicator - keeps the product from being perfect. Fortunately, though, I'd recommend not only this camera, but any Fuji camera, based on what I've experienced so far.", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best zoom I've ever had on a camera", "Author": "TrueBlue", "ReviewID": "RJH8TGCGZ8R10", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after spending a long amount of time reading every review on it. It is a good camera, my favorite thing would have to be how well the zoom works. You get an incredible picture of something so far away. I've never had a camera zoom so much and keep the picture so clear. I love the fact that you do not actually need the camera on to view your photos, you leave the cover up and just hit the button to view photos and it works. I got my camera in black and it looks very good. However, I do not like the slide down cover which turns the camera on. It slides so easily that if it is in my pocket or purse the cover slides down and the camera powers on and drains the battery right out.  I also think the battery dies kind of quickly on it's own with normal camera usage. Taking and viewing photos is very easy and all in all, I am very happy with this camera. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty Good but marred by poor software", "Author": "Just Trying to Help", "ReviewID": "R3UGKJNDTZYT7F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using this camera for several months and I am very pleased.  In that time I have taken exactly 956 pictures so I can say that I have a very good working knowledge of how this camera works.  In fact, the idea that I've taken almost 1000 pictures should tell you that I like the camera.Photo quality:  it does an admirable job and most people will be very pleased.  The white balance works better than most cameras and the picture quality is above average.Touchscreen:  The touchscreen is much better than my Sony DSC-G3 which was significantly more expensive (although the G3 has built in wifi)Sony Cybershot DSC-G3 10MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom with Super Steady Shot Image Stabilization.  the touchscreen worked admirably.  One thing I didn't like about the touchscreen is that it seemed that the camera software was not very polished.  I mean, it could have been better.  the \"buttons\" on the touchscreen are all up and down the left and right sides, so its easy to accidentally press one with your finger when you are just trying to hold the camera normally.  Also, when you press the menu button the menu seems very poorly laid out, with black and white buttons.  while it is functional it was very generic feeling.  i felt that the software engineers could have concatenated some features in submenus or made buttons with similar functions have similar colors.  But what I would REALLY like to see is the buttons I've used before rise to the top of the menu, whereas buttons I never use gradually work their way to the bottom.  Or the ability to make some buttons bigger, or move them around like I can on the iphone.  That would harness the true power of a touchscreen.  Its fine, its just easy to see how it could have been better.the flash performed well.Face register:  Face recognition is becoming more and more common in photo programs, with iPhoto and Google Picasa both offering face recognition for after you take the picture.  This is important for people who want to easily find photos out of 1000s they take.  its also important for people who use facebook.  I did not find that the registration feature worked well, and it had too much difficulty telling my daughters apart and sometimes said it could not register the face at all.Face recognition: One thing I did like was that if you take a picture of a person, after you take the picture it will zoom on the face briefly so you can see if they look nice (open eyes, smile, etc).  This was really nice and showed me if I had to take another picture.Facebook: Overall, I would not buy this camera for the touted facebook compatibility.  You can mark certain photos to upload on facebook the next time you attach the camera to your PC, but this doesn't save time, it just transfers the picture selection time to when you're using the camera instead of when you're using your computer.  And you will need to install the fuji software on your PC to do so.  I've tried a lot of these software packages that come with cameras and they aren't as good as dedicated software like Google Picasa, which you know will keep improving over time.  Proprietary software packages that come with these cameras seem to be abandoned quickly and I'm not going to change software each time I buy a camera.  And the Face registration/recognition that this camera has does not actually fix a problem:  it only takes a few seconds to tag people in photos anyway.  I can only see the facebook integration helping if you were uploading hundreds of pictures to facebook without wanting to tag people.So here is a final rundown:1) Its a much better value than the DSC-G3 which I have been using for a long time.2) Don't buy it for the facebook and youtube integration, or the face registration/recognition.3) Its a lipstick-red camera that fits in your shirt pocket and takes good photos.4) To be good at the other functions it really needs to have better/slicker/more intuitive software included.  I mean, both on the camera and for your PC.If I were you, I would buy it.

The Z700EXR features a large touch screen display, excellent photo quality, a sleek looking casing, video recording, excellent zoom, and automatic and manual shooting modes.  There are four different EXR modes (I assume this is an advanced Fuji feature).  Other shooting modes include Auto, Touch & Shoot, Manual, Movie, and 15 different scene modes.  I also like that you can shoot in black & white or sepia.  However this is standard on pretty much all cameras these days.  I haven't played with all the shooting modes yet, but pictures consistenly come out very nicely on this camera!A couple gripes:  Be careful with your fingers; the placement of the lens makes it easy for stray fingers to find their way into pictures.  Also, I'm not a big fan of rechargeable lithium batteries for cameras in general.  I much prefer using AA batteries, so that I don't have to worry about charging in between uses.  This is not as big a deal if you have a spare battery, which can be found here on Amazon and at other retailers for a decent price.  I can appreciate that rechargeable batteries take up less space and weight than AA lithium or alkaline batteries, and this may be a deal maker or breaker to some.

Also, it's almost too technical. It takes quite a bit of playing around with the settings to get something that looks decent, which defeats the point of a point and shoot camera. The outdoor shots are fine, but nothing special. I am not as impressed with the zoom as other reviewers are.  My indoor shots are even worse.

However, my previous experience with a finepix series camera from Fujiflim was very good, so I was naturally expecting good stuff from the FinePix Z700EXR.  And I was right.The Z700EXR is a very pretty camera.  I really like the color of the body and my friends were all fascinated by the look of it.  And the Z700EXR has a huge display screen.  Everything is touch-based, other than the shutter/zoom and the power switch.  If you are a fan of touch interface, you will really like this.  And it has some features that reminds me of apple products like an iPod touch or an iPad.  You can go to the next picutre by swiping the screen horizontally and if you rotate the camera, then the menu/review screen also rotates.  The touch sensitivity is pretty good and I like the feel of it.  I love the clean back (only display, no button) of the Z700EXR.These days, the point-and-shoot camera has so many picture modes for every possible situations.  The Z700EXR is not an exception and it has more picture program modes than I have ever wanted.  The quality of the picture came out from it is pretty decent and I have absolutely no complaint about it (I have a DSLR camera for serious pictures).  I can take some good pictures with the EXR mode, which is default.  The pictures under low light is competitive and I am fine with it.  The optical image stabilization would be very helpful for some people.  Whenever I review the pictures, I am amazed by the size of the display.  The 3.5 inch display for the size of the Z700EXR feels like a huge screen.And the Z700EXR can capture HD video in 720p resolution (1280*720).  It is a suitable size for YouTube HD and the quality is great if you have sufficient light.  I use the Z700EXR with the Eye-fi wireless memory card, so every video I take is automatically uploaded to YouTube wirelessly (FYI, I set the pictures are uploaded to Picasa web album).The construction of the metal body is very sturdy.  I dropped the Z700EXR several times at different places and have not had any major scratches on it.  If you have a chance to touch it, you will know that this guy is a tough cookie.The only one drawback I have is that the Z700EXR is a fingerprint magnet.  Since the entire back side of the Z700EXR is a touchscreen, there is no way you cannot touch it when you take pictures, and the fingerprints remain very visible.  However, I got used to it already and have been OK with it.Overall, this is another fine Z series camera coming from Fujifilm and I can recommend this to anyone who is looking for a casual camera with cool features and nice color body.

The view screen is very large and, compared to all my Kodaks, easier to see in bright sun. The camera handles indoor settings in dim light better than any of my Kodaks. The battery life is comparable to my Kodaks, which isn't fantastic, but gets me through a pretty active day of picture-taking. There are several nice settings--I particularly like the one where you can touch the portion that you want the camera to focus on. It's stylish. The software is nicer than Kodak's.Cons: The camera is a lot less intuitive to use than any of my Kodaks--it took a long time to figure out how to do certain things. Because the camera has on-screen controls, and because the screen takes up most of the back of the camera, I found myself often accidentally touching controls when I didn't want to. To access the port for the USB cord, you have to open a little latch, and it's slightly awkward to get the cord attached just right. Unlike my Kodaks, this camera's battery does not recharge if the camera is plugged into my computer; you have to remove the battery and put it in the charger. That's annoying, and also means when you travel, you need to take both the charger and the cord.Overall, it's a good camera, and I would recommend it for casual use.

Haggard", "ReviewID": "R5ABALLPRMAMZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received the camera and have played with it briefly and am not as thrilled with all the features. Overall it's a god camera, but not a GREAT camera.As one of the other reviewers mentioned this camera shows fingerprints like crazy. Because the touchscreen on the back is designed to touch you'll find that it gets dirty fast. Often times when I take pictures I've been outside, my hands are dirty, etc. I think this is a flaw in the design of this camear. If I always had clean hands when using it then this wouldn't be a problem, but for me it was not good. I could see if you were in a professional environment like a wedding planner or some job where you were always trying to be in a clean environment this would be an exceptional camera. But when you just throw it in your bag or your pocket you will notice all sorts of dirt on it.Also, the screen takes up SO much of the back of the camera that when used for a short period the entire camera actually heats up. It's not hot to the touch, but you can tell the screen is really pulling a lot of power and it seems like they should have designed it better to cool off. I used the camera briefly outdoors in 90 degree weather and it never had any overheating issues, but I could see if it was left in a purse or in a car on a hot day when you turn it on it could easily have issues. Last thing you want is for a camera to overheat at that moment when you want to take a picture.As for the screen's visibility, not bad in sun light. I did experience some instances where I had issues seeing the screen when trying to take a picture and found myself pointing and shooting hoping I had the picture. I really dislke that there is no physical viewfinder on this thing. Indoors it works well, outdoors it works ok, but in bright sunlight when the sun is behind you reflecting on the screen it can be hard to see.I will also add that this camera comes with it's own software... I tried it for a few minutes, didn't like it and deleted it. On my mac I use iPhoto and on a pc i use picasa both which work better in my eyes with a lot smaller footprint in terms of program size. Plus iPhoto has the same facial recognition features that this camera has and I must say works better then the facial recognition of the camera.From a feature standpoint this camera has some slick features that work and they work pretty good. If I was a standard point and shoot consumer I would probably rate this 4 or 5 stars as it really did a good job for the average user. However, in my application of it where most of my picutres are taken outdoors, it really wasn't up to par and for my use it earned only 3 stars. If they would have included a viewfinder that would have easily earned another star.The picture quality however IS GREAT! Yes this camera takes great photos, but it's all the other stuff you have to deal with to get that great photo that I don't much care for.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's good, but is it good enough?", "Author": "Erin Satie", "ReviewID": "R1XTNSWHAGUBH1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had the Fujifilm FinePix for almost a year now.  I actually owned the first model of the FinePix, and I liked enough to think the newer model would be worth a try.  However, between the time I bought my first FinePix and the time the Z700EXR arrived in my mailbox, something very important happened: I got a smartphone.  So when I got the Z700EXR the question for me wasn't just, \"Is this a good camera?\" it was, \"Is this camera good enough that I want to carry it around in addition to the camera on my smartphone?\"The answer turned out to be no.My absolute favorite feature on the camera was the touch-screen LCD, and I love the feature that focuses the camera wherever you touch the screen with your finger.  It works like a charm, it's easy and intuitive, and it's fun, too.But that was the only feature that would make me reach for my FinePix instead of my smartphone.Good manual controls would have made a huge difference to me, but while the Fujifilm is packed with manual options, they don't do much.  I actually remember, back in the stone ages or whatever, carrying around rolls of 100, 200, 400 and 800 speed film so I could get my photos to look exactly right.  Switching between the ISO options on the Fujifilm, however, doesn't make much of a difference.  It certainly never allowed me to take a decent photograph in low light.  Clicking the macro setting didn't really change the quality of my close-ups.  The only manual option that seems to do much good is the one that will change the color filter depending on the exterior lighting, if it's halogen or flourescent or daylight.The other thing that bothered me, and this might be totally my own fault, but I had a hard time charging the camera.  More than once, I'd plug the charger in at night, wait for the little green light to flicker on so I'd know the battery was charging, and then come back the next morning only to find out the battery I'd been charging all night was still empty.  I switched the outlet where I plugged in the charger, I switched rooms and location, but I had this problem fairly frequently.There were times when I assumed I had a charged battery and ventured forth with my camera only to discover that, nope, the battery was dead.  I learned to double check the batteries before I walked away from the socket, but the long and short of it is, if the charger fails me 25% of the time why would I bother with a camera that only takes SLIGHTLY better pictures than my smartphone?  And the answer is: I mostly didn't.If a smartphone isn't an option for you, and you think the touchscreen focus would be fun, and are pretty confident that the charger problem I had was a fluke, this could be the camera for you.
