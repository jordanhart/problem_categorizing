He wanted a digital camera and was constantly asking to use my more expensive Canon.  The other requirement was that the camera be red.I wanted the cheapest camera I could find that would do the job and be red.  This was the cheapest on Amazon.It is actually a pretty nice camera.  The only problem I have noticed is that the thing eats batteries.  The night I gave it to him, he ran them out, and we're talking in about a 2-3 period of use.  I bought him a case of batteries the next day.  When I was over to their house the other day I noticed it was half gone and it's been about 3 weeks.If you want a cheap and nice camera, this one is fine, but be prepared to replace batteries quite a bit.", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "It's not just the price that's cheap.", "Author": "P. Davis", "ReviewID": "RYFF6H96DZH6X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I highly do NOT recommend this camera.  I was assuming with the polaroid name that it would be a good quality camera even thought the price was so low.  I was wrong.  This camera feels like it's going to fall apart in your hands.  The buttons are hard to press and not real responsive.  The worst part though is that the picture quality is so bad it's almost unusable.  I have an old 3 MP camera from several years ago that takes better pictures than this 9MP camera.  My advice, pay $15 - $20 more and get a better camera.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Should have sent it back", "Author": "CamGuy", "ReviewID": "R1IVMCUQM6TNQ9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as a gift wanting a decent, basic digital camera, based on other reviews that it was just that. I find this camera to be solid and an attractive little item. A nice view screen. Apparently all the money was put into appearences. The digital zoom is useless (resolution too degraded), and the flash seems to be unpredictable when it will fire under certain conditions, so you have to take 2 shots forcing the flash and turning it off to see what you get. I offered to return it, but the recipient waited too long to decide maybe I should. I should have spent another $20-$25 and gotten what I was expecting. If you're outdoors in bright light, and shooting a subject more than 10 ft away, and don't zoom, you will get an acceptable photo.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great choice!", "Author": "Karla M. Marcano \"coquitaina\"", "ReviewID": "RYF65M5I3V60A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought a camera for each of my boys (ages 5 and 8 at the time).  I was looking for a good product that wasn't very expensive because I didn't want to suffer too much if they broke it.This turned out to be the perfect choice.  It has provided my boys a great way to explore the art of photography.  Of course now I have to be always on the lookout because they love to catch me off guard with not so flattering pictures.They have been using their cameras for a year now and they still work perfectly.  I don't know if it's what a skilled photographer would use, but it works great for my boys with good picture quality and a great price.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "good little camera", "Author": "Michael E.
