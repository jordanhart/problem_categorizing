for yourself. Pretty impressive!)---I am so excited to be writing this review. At long last I have what I consider to be the *PERFECT* rugged camera.Before I begin my review, here's my background:I'm a wedding photographer by trade, so I have some pretty good experience-based insight about cameras (although more so with DLSR's) AND I have owned two other waterproof cameras. My first was the Canon D10 and I loved the new freedom it gave me to go underwater but it was huge and ugly (like a big bubble). I used this for years until it Nikon came out with their new Nikon COOLPIX AW100. This \"upgrade\" was actually a HUGE mistake as I found it more like a \"downgrade\" in many ways. Perhaps I'll write a review of the Nikon someday, but I'll mention some comparisons between the two below. To add perspective on that, I sold the Nikon at a loss and waited and studied the competition.  Once the new Canon D20 came out, I was about to press `buy' when I saw an article on this Olympus.  I ended up waiting a few more weeks for this bad-boy to release and I am SO GLAD I did.Construction:The camera looks great and feels sturdy. It's not oversized like the Canon, and not hollow-feeling like the Nikon. It just feels like a well-built machine, and this \"feel\" is important to me.The lens is in the center! This is another one of the standout features of this camera. This allows you to hold it from both sides for even steadier shots.  The other cameras lenses were off to the far left. Not only is that hard for lefties, but it makes them much harder to hold successfully with both hands (without blocking something).The strap is thick and adjustable, which you'll want when you take it in the ocean. In comparison, the Nikon DID NOT even come with an underwater strap - only non-waterproof hand strap, which I felt was an odd choice. The instructions even stated the strap was not to be used in the water. Perhaps it's like selling a DVD player without an HDMI cord? I never looked to see how much Nikon was charging for an underwater strap.The buttons are well-placed, logical and were easy for me to use. Some are small, but they're located well so they're easy to push without pushing something else by accident.The battery case and charger ports are protected with doors that have TWO locks on them. You lock the first, and then you need to lock the second. If you want to open them, reverse the order. I appreciate this added security as I am someone that likes to pick at things in my hands and several times on my Canon I had picked open the batter door in the pool (luckily above water).The screen is big (3\") and, because it is OLED, it is visible from almost any viewing angle and even clear in bright sun. With this being an \"outdoorsy\" camera, the benefits of this screen are great.The 25mm lens is really WIDE! This is just what you want for ocean shots. You can really stretch out the underwater scene and add drama. This camera will be your best friend in Hawaii! I also like the wide angle lens in pools as well.The camera supports add-on lenses that screw on OVER the current lens. In other words, there is no extra vulnerable location for water to get in.Menus:The menu system is exceptional and has a lot of similarities with my $3499 Canon 5d Mark III. When you hit the menu button, you get:Camera Menu 1: compression, shadow adjust, AF mode, metering mode, digital zoom, image stabilizerCamera Menu 2: accessory settings, AF illumination, rec. view, pic orientation, icon guide, date stamp, super-res zoomMovie Menu: image size, IS movie mode, mic, wind noise reduction, recording volumePlayback Menu: slideshow, photo surfing, edit, erase, print order, lock, upload orderSettings Menu 1: format, backup, Eye-Fi, custom mode setup, USB connection, power on, sound settingsSettings Menu 2: file name, pixel mapping, monitor brightness, info, tv out, power save, languageSettings Menu 3: time, world time, reset database, beauty settings, tough settings, gps settingsOn the Nikon, I would have to hunt and peck to find what I was looking for. I was maddening sometimes as I tried to find where the GPS settings were. This is such an issue on the Nikon, you can Google it and see how many people need help finding where to turn the GPS on/off.One feature that has really come in handy is that when you stop the cursor on a menu selection, there is scrolling text at the bottom that says exactly what that button does in a complete sentence! This is a HUGE help for anyone who doesn't want to lug around (or memorize) the manual.GPS:Not only does this camera tag the pictures with the GPS location, but you also can turn on a feature where it will track your entire route for you. For example, if you hike the John Muir trail, you might take pictures every few hours and with another GPS camera you would have a general idea of the path you took but with this one you would have an actual line of your every step. This is an incredible keepsake for `off the grid' exploring hikes.Taking pictures:This camera is SMOKING FAST. Without having to lower the resolution of the photos, you can take 6 frames per seconds, which is the same as my Canon 5d mark III. Incredible! In fact, it takes pictures so fast that when you playback in the camera, it shows them in succession like a movie. This was an incredible way to watch my kids dive into the pool and then swim up to me!The picture quality is fantastic. On both the Canon and the Nikon I always felt let-down by my end results. Something about these underwater cameras makes them produce pictures without enough contrast. This means that the pictures would lack the \"POP\" that I love so much in regular photography. Of course you can artificially add this in post-processing, but it's an extra step I don't need. This OLYMPUS doesn't suffer from this problem so the pictures really look great straight out of the camera.Movie Mode:I have only done a little with the movies, but the ones I've done so far are beautiful. There's something amazing about being able to shoot a video underwater. It's a lot of fun. As time goes by, I'll report back to add more about the video capabilities.Fun Modes:In addition to the standard modes (auto, P, action, low light, and scene), there are also \"Magic\" modes which are very fun to play with. They are akin to Instagram pictures in that they apply effects to the picture but what makes them more fun is that you see the effects as you take it! Here are the modes with brief descriptions:Pop art - oversaturated colorsPin hole - vignette, like an old cameraFish eye - simulates a fish-eye lens (really fun!)Line - drawing turns the picture into something like a coloringbook pageSoft focus - like old school wedding photography (eek!)Punk - turns pictures pink and black (actually more fun than you might think)Sparkle - simulates a star filter, which turns any points of light into stars (great for Christmas lights or city lights)Watercolor - mutes the colors, adds line (see `Line' above)Reflection - like a kaleidoscopeMiniature - simulates a tilt-shift lens. If you haven't heard of this style of photography, Google it. Super fun.Fragmented - like a shattered mirrorDramatic - processes pictures with a \"grunge\" lookI am not usually a fan of these types of special effects, but for the review I thought I'd test them out. A few are gimmicky for sure, but some, such as the fish-eye, sparkle, pin-hole, and miniature are actually quite fun and a few of those will be useful for more than just goofing around (i.e. sparkle at Christmas, fish-eye of skateboarding, etc.)Conclusion:I have finally found what I've been looking for in a waterproof camera. Something I don't have to baby that takes GREAT pictures without any of the sacrifices typically associated with \"rugged\" point-and-shoot cameras.I wholeheartedly recommend this camera with no reservations.If you found this review helpful, please let me know! Also, if you have any questions, feel free to post them in the comments and I'll try my best to answer them.---7/3/2012 UPDATE:I continue to enjoy this camera! The amount of fun pictures I've taken this summer that I wouldn't have been able to take on my other camera (because of exposure to water, sand, etc) has been worth the cost of admission alone. Here's something else I love:The mode dial on the camera is a such a useful feature (more than you would think). Recently I had the camera in the middle of a lake at a floating obstacle course with my kids. I was taking pictures of them diving off this platform in 60fps mode and then I wanted to switch back into standard mode and all I had to do was twist the dial. It was hard enough treading water in the choppy lake, so having the ability to switch with ease was such a help. It I had to dig through a complicated menu system, I probably would have sunk to the bottom! ;)Here are the modes available from the dial:iAUTO - Camera chooses the mode based on the sceneProgram Auto (this is what I use mostly) - Like iAUTO, but allows you to make changes to: flash, macro, self-timer (12 sec, 2 sec), exposure compensation, white balance, ISO, sequential (1 fps, 6 fps at 12mp, 60 fps at 3mp), and photo size (megapixels).Low light mode - Again, thanks Olympus for having this just be a dial so my wife, who doesn't like to spend as much time learning the ins-and-outs of my cameras can just switch it over with a twist of the dial when we're indoorsAction mode - Capture fast moving subjects without blur, enables sequential shootingScene mode - Changes modes based on subject. This is a great way to ensure you get the best picture you can without having to rely on auto-mode.The choices are: indoor, candlelight (for birthdays), self-portrait, sunset, fireworks, cuisine, documents, beach and snow, snapshot, underwater wide, underwater action, underwater macro, pet mode - cat (lol), pet mode - dog, snow, panorama, 3d - photo, backlit HDR, portrait, beauty, landscape, night scene, night portrait.If you shoot a lot, it should be pretty easy to speculate what settings each mode makes. For example, sunset mode bumping up the saturation on reds, purples, yellows; fireworks mode using a longer shutter-speed to get light trails; beauty mode using a softer focus, neutral skin-tones, etc.Magic mode - See description above in original reviewC1 and C2 - These custom modes are incredibly useful. If you find yourself dialing in certain settings for situations you encounter often, you can just assign those settings to one of these 2 modes on the dial. For example, my brother-in-law likes to examine my nephews pitching on the 60fps (3mp) mode so he has assigned these settings the the C1 mode and just remembers that C1 mode is \"Zach's Pitching Mode.\" Now when he takes pictures during a game, he can just flip over the C1 from iAUTO mode whenever Zach pitches. Super-useful!", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "great stills, terrible video sound, bad service from Olympus", "Author": "meppel07", "ReviewID": "R3JFTIW3LO0F0Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My TG-1 has a very annoying ticking sound in all the video's that I shot so far (even if I follow the advice from the manual to set the video sound to 'low'). I contacted Olympus, sent them sample vids and they refused the warranty claim because they consider this normal for this camera. Check out this samples to find out what Olympus thinks is \"perfectly normal behaviour\" for this camera:[...][...]These vids were made with one shot AF, IS off, and I can also confirm that this has nothing to do with the sound of the optical zoom (which is hardly noticeable in this camera).Olympus says this sound is a consequence of waterproofing the camera, but they wouldn't tell me why other waterproof camera's apparently don't have this problem.It's a real shame Olympus will not warrant this, because the rest of the camera is really good: great 2.0 lens, fast performance, very good image quality (esp. high iso and macro) for its class and nice, functional body design.You might get lucky with your sample (or maybe not so unlucky as I was,) but be warned that Olympus will not grant any warranty claims if you end up with video sound like this.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Olympus TG-1 iHS: Excellent Rugged Camera", "Author": "Chris Nichols \"Power is nothing without control.\"", "ReviewID": "R8A1UYCVISAUS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a current owner of the Olympus Stylus Tough 6000 for the past several years, I have experienced all the great, and not so great, things about owning a rugged camera.  The Tough 6000 is most certainly a tough little thing.  It has survived many many lake and ocean swims, including long snorkeling trips and pool days, a Vegas bachelor party where it was dropped several times on the ground and had beer poured on it, been on multi-day snow skiing trips in sub zero temperatures, and even survived for over 20 minutes in the blazing heat of the clothes dryer when I forgot it in my shorts pocket (which also means it survived the wash cycle prior to the dryer!).  While its toughness is certainly excellent, there are some things it needs improvement on.  Start up speed, speed between taking pictures, shutter lag, difficulty in finding focus in low light, poor quality in low light, non-HD video, and xD picture cards were all things on my wish list for improvement.  Thankfully, the new TG-1 iHS has resolved all those problems, which I will detail below.- Start up speed: Using a stopwatch, I consistently was able to hold down the shutter button while pressing the power button and get the camera to take a picture in around 1.5 seconds while in Program mode.  This is way faster than the Tough 6000 could ever manage and find it quite satisfactory.- Speed between taking pictures: There really is no lag between taking pictures anymore.  The camera will take pictures as fast as you can repeatedly press the shutter button.  In the dedicated Sport mode the results are even more impressive.  At full 12MP, the camera is taking about 10 frames per second, but if you knock the image size down to 3MP it will capture an insane number of pictures per second.  Olympus rates the highest speed at 60fps, but I have not confirmed this.  I did test it out on my friend doing jumping jacks and it's really pretty nuts.  It is very slow motion on the order of frame by frame video. (I have experience with video editing, so I am not just throwing that term out there blindly.)  The sport mode is really cool for capturing people jumping in to a pool, doing cart wheels, or any other action where a set of high speed sequential shots is desirable.  Olympus really did a good job on improving this aspect from the Tough 6000.  (NOTE: the sequential shooting speed appears to depend somewhat on the speed on the SD card being used as, after a few seconds of taking pictures, the SD card logo on the OLED monitor turns from white to red and the camera stops taking pictures.  The picture counter will catch up to the number of pictures taken and then the SD card symbol will turn back to white.  I am using a 16GB SanDisk Ultra II class 4 card rated at 15MB/s.  I would imagine higher speed cards would enable the camera to take either more pictures per second, take sequential pictures for a longer period of time, or even perhaps both.)- Shutter Lag: Shutter lag is pretty much non-existent.  I have been using film and digital SLRs for years and am used to the instant shutter speed of such cameras and the TG-1 compares quite nicely to them, especially for a \"point and shoot\" style camera.- Focus hunting in low light: I have taken several pictures in low light settings, some with flash and some without, and found the auto focus speed to be vastly improved from the Tough 6000.  You will no longer have to tell a group of people to hold still forever while the camera is attempting to focus on them.- Low light quality: The F2.0 lens really makes a noticeable difference here as low light quality is so much improved over the Tough 6000.  Quality low light pictures can be obtained, even without using the flash.- Video: The HD video, both 1080 and 720, comes out nice considering this is primarily a still camera.  It is certainly not as good as the video from my Canon Vixia HF10, which is a purpose built camcorder, but that is to be expected.  I do like that the video is started and stopped using its own dedicated recording button on the back of the camera.  That way the camera can be set up in whatever still shooting mode you find desirable for the moment, but start shooting a video literally at the press of a button if the moment calls for it.  The camera allows you to zoom during shooting and adjusts exposure on the fly in the middle of recording.  This is very nice as you are able to reframe your videos and not worry about exposure changes while in the middle of shooting a video.  The one main negative I can point to about video is that the zoom motor noise is clearly audible in the recording.  This is unfortunate, but considering the camera's core mission as a rugged still camera, it is acceptable.  The noise is not loud enough to drown out all other sounds, but is certainly noticeable.  The camera records video in the Apple mov file format, which may be good or bad depending on your preference.That pretty much does it for the comparison between the older Tough 6000 and the new TG-1.Other things to note about the TG-1 are:- The strap is quite beefy for a point and shoot strap and is more like the one I have on my camcorder.  I find this to be good though as the traditional point and shoot straps are always so thin it makes me nervous when the camera is dangling by it over a precarious position.- The screen is quite large, has great quality, and has an excellent viewing angle.- I like the lens being in the middle of the camera as it reduces the odds of getting fingers in the shot and is just more natural for framing shots in general.- The mode dial has dedicated spots for Sport, Low Light, and two Custom Setup options allowing you to save custom set ups that are quickly accessible.- The access doors are now double locked, meaning they have a slider that shuts the door, then another slider that keeps the first slider from moving.  This added security is certainly welcomed.I have not tried out the GPS function or the manometer function, so can't really comment on those.  They aren't terribly important to me, so that's why.Finally, some negatives:- As others have stated, the button layout is a little cramped.  I don't have a problem navigating around the button layout, but those with clumsy and/or large fingers may find it a tad challenging perhaps.- Like the Tough 6000, the TG-1 still uses the lame proprietary USB port that Olympus for some reason insists on using.  This forces you to carry around the included proprietary USB cable they provide to hook the camera up to a computer and to charge it.- Speaking of charging, the camera does not come with an external battery charger.  This forces you to keep the battery in the camera to charge it via the aforementioned proprietary USB cable connected to either a computer's USB port or the included AC adapter.  As of right now, 6/28/2012, there is no external charger available for purchase.  This is incredibly lame as it makes it impossible to charge a spare battery and use the camera at the same time; which is something everyone wants to do on a multi-day vacation.  Hopefully Olympus will come out with one soon or perhaps a third party will.Overall I think this is an excellent rugged camera that really nails all the features necessary to excel in this camera segment.  The TG-1 is most certainly a big step forward from the Tough 6000 and I am very glad I purchased it.  Besides the relatively minor negatives mentioned above, this is a sure fire winner for anyone looking for a rugged camera.***UPDATE JULY 6th, 2012***Just got a new SD card and tested out the difference in speed, with emphasis on the sequential sport mode.Before I present the data, here are the cards being used:- OLD: 16GB SanDisk Ultra II Class 4 rated at 15MB/s- NEW: 32GB SanDisk Extreme Class 10 UHS 1 rated at 45MB/sSport mode results:- 12MP Sequential:  - OLD: 100 frames in 30 seconds, 3.33fps (frames per second)  - NEW: 100 frames in 20 seconds, 5fps- 3MP Hi 1 Sequential:  - OLD and NEW: 100 frames in 7 seconds, 14.29fps (no difference between cards)- 3MP Hi 2 Sequential:  - OLD and NEW: 100 frames in 1 second, 100fps; yes one hundred frames per second! (no difference between cards)As you may have noticed, all the tests involved shooting 100 frames.  This was not my choosing, but appears to be the maximum allowable sequential images the camera will take at a time.  For each of the tests I held the shutter button down until the camera stopped taking pictures, so it was not my choice to stop at 100.  You will also notice that the only speed increase is in the 12MP sequential test, whereas the other two modes have the same speed.While not recorded for time, I would like to note that the time it took the camera to process and save the images after each burst mode seemed to me to take less time with the newer card, especially in the Hi 1 and Hi 2 modes.***UPDATE May, 2014***Our TG-1 now exhibits the continuous clicking noise during video recording that many others have reported with the TG-1 and TG-2.  Up until this point, the camera did not have this problem, so am not sure why it just started.  From everything I've read online, it appears it is the autofocus (AF) making this noise.  I believe this to be true because the noise stops if I put the camera in Underwater Wide 2 mode or if I hold down the zoom out button, both of which temporarily stop the AF from working.I was excited to hear that Olympus is coming out with the TG-3 and hoped they would fix this AF clicking noise during video, but it appears not.  In the comments section at the bottom of an article written by William Brawley at imaging-resource.com, he confirms that his sneak peak trial version of the TG-3 has the same AF clicking noise during video.  It is really unfortunate and disappointing that Olympus couldn't resolve this issue by the third generation of this camera line, for it makes any video shot with these cameras almost unwatchable due to the annoying constant clicking noise.  I had actually planned on buying the TG-3 because I figured they would have fixed this glaring defect by the third model version, but now I am strongly considering not doing so because of this.  I'll wait to read some reviews after the camera goes on sale next month to make final judgement though.  Perhaps William just got a faulty pre-release model and the final production versions will not have this issue.Link to article: [...]", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera is Incomplete", "Author": "Kailua Steve", "ReviewID": "R1MGH10NDJICX6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My previous WP camera was a Pansonic which took great video but the images really suffered from pixel packing and over processing. I bought this Oly primarily for its fast, quality lens. Despite its small sensor, I'd hoped that the lens would keep the images decent in low-light situations which are common for this type of camera.It seems to work as described. I bought a fast SD card and the camera is very fast with it. I'm not particularly interested in all of the trick \"filters\" and GPS (I have one), but I did test the auto-stitch panoramas and they were all without artifacts. The fact that the camera is so fast allows taking three images quickly, so that the scene has little time to change between images.With my other cameras, I typically underexpose my images and shoot raw so that the skies aren't blown out. In preliminary shooting with this camera, it seems like the default values are as good as one can get with these JPGs.PLUSES: the doors are double-latched and have a really tight fit. The OLED screen is wonderful. The lens is typical good Oly quality.MINUSES: Because of the large screen, the controls are a little too tightly packed for my fat digits, but I prefer this large screen to having wider spaced controls and a smaller screen. The only real complaint I have is the cheesy in-camera charger. Oly makes an external charger that one can currently only buy on eBay ($40!) but this seems pretty lame in a top-of-the-line model when $100 cameras have the convenience of external chargers. Also, the one-of-a-kind charging connector to the camera requires you to keep yet /another/ special USB cable for each USB device.I assume the charging issues will lessen as soon as decent no name chargers arrive and the real Oly charger becomes more widely available.If it shot raw (no WP cameras do, that I know of) and if it had a grown-up charger, I'd rate it as a \"5\" but none of my complaints with it are very significant. I expect to like it more as I use it more.UPDATE: Today the Oly charger is $84!! on eBay and $60 plus shipping etc. at B&H.;  What must it cost Oly to have these made in China, $5?UPDATED 9/11/12  I recently bought the $40 (!!!) adapter to allow attaching tele and fisheye lenses. It also allows use of 40.5 mm filters and lens caps. Then it dawned on me: THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE CAMERA IN THE FIRST PLACE. As it is shipped, the camera offers no protection for the glass lens cover, which has a special coating to repel water. The plastic do-nothing ring that ships with the camera is useless. The \"$40\" threaded ring is functional and should have been integrated into the camera in the first place. Now I can use a lens cap on the camera like I should have been able to in the first place. To sell a $400 camera that requires another $40 plastic ring to be complete is really poor design. I'll remove one star in my rating.", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "It is what it is", "Author": "now what", "ReviewID": "R139CRCDJOCGDC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The first part of this review is an \"out-of-water\" review; below it is a review of performance in and on the water.Design and controls:--Design: attractive, functional.  Tradeoff between small size and crowded controls worked out OK once you get used to it.--Double-latch doors: good idea.--Other users have reported easily losing the plastic ring around the lens because it has no click latch.  Oly must have fixed this; mine makes a loud click when you put it on, and it requires pushing in on one spot while turning, otherwise it won't come off.* (At least not in the living room--but read on.)  At any rate, if you lose it Oly says it's \"cosmetic\" and doesn't affect waterproof capability.--Menus: OK once you get used to them.  The quick Info menu is good.--Display: the LCD is good, but like most of them virtually useless in bright sunlight.  The onscreen display showing basic shooting settings and other info is good.--The in-camera battery charging is a pointless complication (the camera comes with a plug-in charger, so why not just make it so you can put the battery into it and keep a charged one in the camera, instead of going through the process with an extra cord, etc.).  Luckily there are aftermarket out-of-camera chargers available.--The online manual (which I have downloaded in PDF) is woefully inadequate, poorly organized and tells you almost nothing.  Perhaps they want everyone to just leave the controls alone.  (For a good manual from a competing product, see the Canon D10 manual.)  To compensate, Olympus has posted FAQs on their site; also some informational highlights.Things to watch out for:--This is the only camera I've ever seen in which the battery will slide in both ways (right way and wrong way) so the user has to be sure to check that the terminals are lined up or it won't charge.  Another example of making things easy for the manufacturer instead of for the purchaser.--JPEG default is set at Normal, which generates an image of something over 2mp, meaning that most of the data captured by the sensor is being thrown away.  (If you set to Fine, you preserve about twice as much data--but you're still losing a lot.)--Digital zoom or intelligent superzoom is noisy:  I shot the same picture with full optical zoom and again with full maximum digital zoom.  Then I enlarged both so that the subject had the same dimensions in each.  The digital zoom image was full of noise.  Stick to optical zoom and enlarge, if you want to, with one of the many PP programs available.--Olympus recommends sending the camera in yearly to get the seals replaced.  This will cost you about 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of the camera itself, each year.  So maybe the most cost-effective strategy is to keep the seals clean and lubed with silicon, and gamble that you'll get 3-4 years of life before it dies from leakage.  Just hope this doesn't happen on the first day of that big diving trip you've been looking forward to for years.  (Although you could go online, order a new camera from Amazon with next-day air, and get it in time, maybe.)--Other users have noted that the TCON will create horrible vignetting unless almost fully zoomed.  So when you have the TCON on, you basically have a dedicated lens, with little flexibility.--*The lens ring will fall off (mine did), regardless of the push-and-turn feature.  If you're going in the water, I suggest leaving the ring at home so it doesn't get lost.  According to Olympus, it's merely \"cosmetic\" so you aren't affecting the waterproofing.  Keep the ring in case you want to resell the camera, or send it back.The Good:--Colors are very nice right from the camera at WB Auto setting.--Burst shooting and, just as important, burst depth.  With a class 10 card I got better than 5fps at full resolution, and I got 18 shots before the camera began to  hiccup and slow down.  After this, I still got about 3fps.  This suits my goal of action shooting.--I found that using the P setting, keeping ISO at 100 and EV at -1/3, I could shoot into glare without losing highlights, even though this camera really limits user control.The Bad:--Can't seem to control shutter speed.  I tried the P setting using ISO100 (the idea being that the camera would use a balanced combination of fast shutter speed and smaller aperture); instead, on one shot the EXIF data showed 1/200 sec. and f/18 (still trying to figure out how the TG-1 goes to f/18); on the next shot it was 1/500 sec. and f/11.  I did find that using the P mode, keeping ISO at 100 and EV at -1/3, I could shoot into glare without losing highlights.--Can't shoot RAW, and can't shoot JPEG extra-fine, which limits enlarging and cropping.--Images are very soft and fine detail (leaves, etc.) is often smeared.Many of the positive reviews seem to be based on a different set of expectations--people wanted a toy to play with in the swimming pool or let their 3-year-old play with it.  Or they are going to make prints at under 8inches or post online at 800x600px.  I'm not expecting DSLR quality, but when a 12mp P&S; camera like the FZ150 can take outstanding pix at full zoom, one does hope that a 12mp underwater P&S; would have some decent capabilities.Bottom line:If you want to take pix in a wet or underwater environment, and you want rapid burst, all at a reasonable cost, this is probably your best option.  Other water cams have high leakage/failure rates; for example the Hero has a reported 20% failure rate and they will not guarantee the product (read their rather arrogant warning/disclaimer on their product page on Amazon).  The TG-1 appears to be the most reliable (least unreliable?), fastest burst, brightest lens, and about average image quality.Here's what some professional reviewers had to say after the initial \"gee whiz\" reactions.\"The TG-1 does not offer what we consider to be manual controls--no manual focus, no priority or manual exposure modes. This is typical for a tough-cam, though it's off-putting to some photography enthusiasts who are drawn in by the f/2 lens and excited by the prospect of a more \"serious\" tough cam. This is not that camera--it's a standard tough-cam with a better lens and screen than any of its competitors.\"Another reviewer, talking about IQ: \"At its lowest ISO settings, the TG-1 seems to drift between over-sharpened or soft and smeary when photos are viewed at 100 percent. And really it continues that all the way up to ISO 800; above that things just gets soft and noisy.... Video quality is...basically like the video from a pocket video camera or higher-end smartphone.\"Here's another:  \"We ran into glitchy performance with the TG-1, and it even crashed on us a few times. It typically occurred while we were switching between shooting mode and playback mode. The image on the LCD would hang for at least a few seconds, sometimes completely locking up the camera.\"In-the-water review follows.  Out of the water, it's a solid 3-star performer--average at best.-----------------------Ocean test: I would give this camera 2.5 stars in the water (not good), for the reasons listed below.Before going in the water, I took a couple of hundred shots at the beach.--As mentioned before, color is nice.--I used P mode, ISO 100, EV-1/3 and got very good results in terms of WB and highlight preservation.--Stationary objects came out pretty well, a little soft but acceptable.--Shooting at moving birds (aiming down from a low cliff at pelicans gliding over water) was not so good, because the AF was poor, even though the AF box indicated that the shot was in focus.  I was shooting 10-12 frame bursts at 5fps.  The birds were about 80 feet away, and traveling across the field of vision, so there was little change in distance.  Most of the images in each burst were out of focus,  but every few frames in the same burst one would be in focus.  So the AF is jumping all around and missing most of the time.  (I considered the possibility of camera shake, but at 1/200sec this would be unacceptable IS; P&S; super-zooms at 300mm (450mm equiv) show no camera shake even at 1/125 or slower.)I then paddled out to a small surf break (with the camera in a neoprene belt pouch) and sat beside the break to take pictures of waves and surfers.  I took another 200 shots or so.--Got some very nice and interesting shots over the water toward the shore, focus was good and as usual color was great.  This is basically the same as stationary objects (above).--The good action pictures were very nice; a little soft but acceptable.  The foam of the breaking waves wasn't blown out by overexposure, but at 100% it looked like a collection of small blobs, rather than foamy spray.  My old Canon PowerShot SX100is (8mp P&S;) did a much better job of detail in shots like this (from the shore, of course!).-- Some images had a weird bluish haze on a large part of the image--appears to be from the lens fogging up due to temperature change (water about 67, air about 75 degrees) as the camera was immersed and then out of the water.  This was present in a minority of images, but it was serious; the images that had it were ruined.  (No, it wasn't my hand over the lens.)  I sent samples to Olympus for their analysis; no word back as yet.--Just as with the pelican shots from the cliff, there were more OOF pictures than good ones, even though the AF box indicated that the shot was in focus.  Again, I was shooting 10-12 frame bursts at 5fps.  There was a lower percentage of OOF images. (See comments on possible camera shake, above.)-- The LCD was of little use most of the time due to the bright sun, so it was really hard to see the subject.  (Not unusual with P&S; cameras without a viewfinder, but Olympus has touted the visibility of their LCD.  It seems no better than any other.)  A true \"point and guess\" situation: when I tried to shoot birds flying overhead (using burst), I missed them and got only blue sky.  I got a little better luck with a helicopter;  in a burst of 10 frames I managed to get part of the helicopter in two frames.  The surfers were a bit easier because you could track them by the wake they made going across the wave, but even then (from a distance of about 100 ft.) it was hit and miss.*--Regardless of the push-turn latch on the lens ring, when I got back home and put the camera in fresh water, I noticed that the lens ring had fallen out somehow.  I have ordered a replacement from Olympus.  (It has been several days, and no word on when it will ship.  Olympus Customer Service does not answer emails on this issue.  Overall this is becoming a bad experience and will definitely affect my decisions regarding Olympus products in the future.)  BTW the poorly-attached lens ring is a known issue; Olympus even has it on their Q&A;/Info page online.  Apparently they are in no rush to fix it.I gave this camera one more try today; the results were no different.  Some \"OK\" images, a lot of images with smeared detail and/or a harsh, artificial look (presumably due to in-camera sharpening, since I didn't change the settings from shot to shot in the burst).  I even did some extensive PP with the best images; although with a lot of work I managed to get them quite a bit better, they were still inferior to images from other P&S; cameras I have owned.  With regret, I give up.Bottom line:  the TG-1 is probably very good for close range, stationary objects, swimming pools, water parks, warm water, underwater (no abrupt temperature fluctuations while shooting and no bright sun glaring off the LCD), and many types of still shots.  It's also probably very good if you intend to post images online, email them, view them on a computer, or print them at some size under about 8-10in or so.  For anyone considering this camera for viewing at 100%, larger prints, surf, breaking waves, flying birds and other ocean action shots (especially in the water), I recommend against it.  I have decided to send this one back and wait for further improvements in the product.  The basic concept and design are great, but the above items need work. It's truly a shame, because I love the burst shooting, the color and the handling, and the few reasonably good images make it tempting to keep the camera--but I just don't want to spend time and energy stalking that \"special\" shot, only to find it unusable for one of the reasons mentioned above.------------Later note:  Doing more research, I find that for about $50 more than the TG-1, I can get a camera + housing combination that could well give better results.  The Lumix ZS15 has full controls, has 16x zoom, has gotten good reviews on IQ, and it fits the Panasonic Marine Case.  (There are cheaper cases, little more than a ziplock baggie, but I don't have the nerve to entrust them with a camera costing $200 or more.  Why risk it?)  Both items may be found listed on Amazon; if Olympus ever sends the lens ring so I can return the TG-1, I'll do so and try the Panasonic combination.  I'm also attracted to the Lumix LX7 (not much zoom, but shoots RAW, has good burst), but haven't yet found a housing to fit it.--------------Final update:I finally got the ring from Oly and sent the camera back for refund.  Had the ring been missing, Amazon could have charged me up to 50% restocking fee (\"missing part\")!  For a defective item. I had to pay Oly $7 + shipping for the ring, and Amazon charged me postage since the problem wasn't due to their error. (!)  At least they took it back.I then ordered the ZS15 for $165 new on Amazon. I got it a couple of days ago; in good light it is very good for a small-sensor camera (although not the equal of the FZ150--full details in my 4-star review of the ZS15).I have ordered two underwater housings: the full-dress Pany housing and an \"econo\" version which makes me nervous but which got good reviews and not one \"it leaks!\" complaint. When these arrive, I'll test them in the bathtub with tissue paper, and then brave the waves.It's hard to understand why the underwater camera makers choose to put out these inferior products. My total cost for the ZS15 + housing is a shade over $400--for a package that is far superior to the dedicated underwater models costing almost as much. Why not put a first-rate camera in a waterproof shell and market that? It's really disappointing.", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera with a few shortfalls....", "Author": "JayBird", "ReviewID": "R2TE93PL6U8TED", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start my review by saying that this is my first Olympus camera and I'm pretty impressed at what this \"little\" camera packs in for the money.I'm normally one to buy Canon products and have many years of experience in photography. I've owned a Canon Rebel XT, and XTi and currently shoot with a Canon 7D. I also own two pocket cameras, a Canon SD850is and a Canon SD1400is. I do a lot of mountain biking and other \"rough\" outdoor activities so I've always been hesitant to pack any of my currently owned cameras with me to shoot while on the trail. I was looking for something to suppliment my helmet mount sports cameras that usually go with me for video but just do OK for photos. When I saw that Olympus was releasing the TG-1 I looked into it heavily. What swayed me from Canon or Nikon was the F2.0 lens. While to the average person taking photos this may not have made a selling point but to someone who's shot photos in a vareity of challenging lighting situation the F2.0 is a huge plus. (more on that later) The fact that it was virtually crush proof also made a big selling point as I would be stuffing the camera into my Camelbak along with snacks and other stuff which sometimes gets compressed/crush together to make it more comfortable to ride with it on my back. The more minor selling point was the listing of the water resistant coating on the lens and LCD which causes water to roll off vs beading when say transitioning from under to above water... A problem with my sports video cameras is that I have to blow the drops off or face shots with water droplets in the shots.Ok so as I said I really like this camera. I have been very impressed at the image quality in general both above and below the water. Taking photos at/in the pool as a test I was pleasantly surprised as how awesome they looked. Pretty comparable to my Canon pocket cameras. The iAuto mode though is a bit flaky but I shoot with it mostly in P. The camera also has a variety of sceen modes but I didn't find to much of a difference in them from shooting in P. I'm not one to use the MAGIC modes or special effects modes since I do most of that after shooting in Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop. If you do use them though the few test shots I did with each SCN mode were high quality shots though some additional control over some modes like \"draw\" effect would be nice. What has impressed me the most though is the two 3 megapixel high speed shooting modes. Putting the camera on H2 for 60fps shooting was amazing. Taking photos of my kids running or diving produced some very crisp shots both above and below the water. I've been able to grab some shots I couldn't have done with any of my other cameras. What impressed me more is some of the shots were taken with ISO100 and still produced 1/2000 shutter speeds through the whole range of shots. Get yourself a big memory card though if you use this mode as you will take a ton more photos that you expect. One quick press of the shutter can produce over 100 photos in H2 mode. Unfortunately there are just too many good things to write about this camera and I'm still discovering modes and features that I like. Although I won't ever use the BEAUTY FIX mode I played with it for fun and my jaw dropped at how much can be done inside the camera with certain types of portraits. Get this camera and try if for yourself.There are though a few negative things I have to say that probably aren't really fixable or maybe don't need to be fixed at all but none the less they are things that have frustrated me. They're not game changers though and I still love this camera. The first and biggest negative I have is that the mode dial was very very difficult (almost impossible) to turn when underwater or when my hands were wet. There's just not enough grip on the side of the wheel to turn it. I finally was able to turn it with two fingers, one resting on the flat side of the dial. At first I thought that putting it underwater showed a defect in the one I had because of this but once I dryed it an my hands off I had no problems turning it. The second negative I have is that when you use the high speed shooting modes that dump to the SD card takes FOREVER (which is a bit to be expected when you've shot 100+ photos in two seconds) BUT there's no indication on the camera that it's doing anything and none of the buttons respond during the save operation. I do have it set to only display shot information overlay for 10 seconds and once that 10 seconds is up the SD write indicator isn't visible. They should have a light on the back like most cameras do to show SD activity. It took 20 - 30 seconds in some cases to clear the buffer to SD and the camera wouldn't respond to anything during that time though it did show the \"viewfinder\" image during that time. The menu's are a little confusing as well despite the \"teaching\" mode that shows you in text what each mode does when you set it. There's two digital zoom modes which are still confusing me. Normally I don't like digital zoom but the on Super Zoom mode produced some good results for me without all the normal grain and such you find with digital zoom.Overall though I have to highly recomend this camera. Despite being a Canon guy Olympus has impressed me with this one. Way to many features to put in one review. Excellent image quality. Impressive f2.0 shutter speed. High speed shooting mode that I'm very impressed with and will use time and time again even at 3MP. What else to say other than I'm very happy with my purchase. While my 7D won't be collecting dust because there's still many uses for a DSLR I will have to say that my other two Canon pocket cameras will probably collect dust. This camera will now replace the others as my suppliment to the 7D and will be my primary camera for outdoor adventure photo taking.", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beast of a camera", "Author": "D.P", "ReviewID": "R16YE9KXMEHO8C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all the beautiful oled screen is a joy to look at when composing the shot.

The ultra bright f2 lens coupled with a beautiful oled screen with high resolution is the best combination for a point and shoot in my opinion. The screen resolution higher than some of the most advanced micro four thirds and dslr cameras out there and you will notice that right away. However, i noticed that the colors that appear on the oled screen looks a little bit saturated than the subjects native colors. Nevertheless when you open them on the computer the images you will realize that everything looks 100% accurate on the final file processed via the cameras tru pic engine. I also use the famous s100 from canon and managed to do a side by side file comparison with 100% crop to see how good the lens and the sensor really is. It is obvious that the canon has the edge when you crop the pictures because when fully zoomed in to the picture the olympus looks a bit smudgy vs the picture taken from the canon preserves the sharpness throughout the picture.The build quality of the camera is fantastic. I managed to test it in different conditions and like it says in the body itself, it is tough indeed. This camera has super awesome macro capabilities that i have never seen on a point and shoot. There are three option, macro, super macro and super macro with led. Yes it has a built in led to illuminate ur subject which is extremely useful when you bring the camera inches away from the subject. Loads of scene modes including high dynamic range which is my favorite. Ihave nofera carrying this camera with me all day every day unlike my s100 because its fully weather sealed, and rugged. It may not have all the manual control that canon offers, but if you are a outdoor person like me you will appreciate ur companion who is going to survive under any condition. One good splash of water or some sand on the lens barrel on a fully manual control point and shoot will freeze the lens with an error or fry the electronics inside for good.

It was a pain to carry around both cameras whenever I went somewhere so I wanted to find a camera that was close to a top end Point & Shoot but also had the protection that the waterproof/shockproof cameras provide. I did look at all the high-end waterproof cameras currently out there, and decided on this one. I'm glad I did. This camera met and exceeded my expectations, and I daresay it takes better photos than the Canon did.I will put up some sample photos, but I feel the image quality this camera delivers is great. Between automatic and other settings I've used (night portrait, beach/snow, underwater portrait, HDR) the images I get look fantastic. When we loaded all the photos onto our iPad during the cruise (an iPad 3, if it matters) at first glance it was very difficult to even tell which photos were taken with the DSLR and which were taken with this camera! In fact my wife was jealous of some of the colors I was getting with this Olympus, mainly during the HDR shots I was taking.I carried this camera around with me everywhere on the cruise and always got a reliable shot, whether it be inside the boat, on dock, on shore or in the ocean. Absolutely happy with this purchase. There's a lot more I can do with this camera that I haven't yet (manual settings, etc) but what I have used is great. And the GPS feature, if you like to see where you take photos it's fantastic. I loved loading the pictures on the iPad and having it show me where I took the pictures.That's not to say there are not some nagging issues (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). Those are:- The software on the computer. It's clunky and seems to be the only way to really import photos. I need to find a workaround so I can just pull the photos off the camera. It's slow to start importing and always goes through questions (do you want to add location? Do you want to facial scan?). And it also labels the folders terribly. I think it does a date AND time stamp? I'm not sure. They are long strings of numbers. I was looking for a specific photo earlier today and had a hard time figuring out what folder it was in, even though I knew the day it was taken. For example, photos that were taken on 10/7/12 are in folder 201210713506831. Yeah. If anyone knows how to change the folder names on import I'd love to know.- After about 1500 pictures during the cruise the camera started to load up slower than normal to the point where I could take the first photo. Also it started to not save the GPS coordinates for some reason. A big batch of the last day  is missing GPS, and then there are some, and then it's missing again. Not sure what happened there. It did show it had locked GPS coordinates when I was taking the photos but it didn't save it.- Battery/charging: The battery is good but not great, and it has to be charged with a USB cable connected to the side of the camera. I only hit low battery one day on the cruise, and it was when I took 300 photos and about 10 videos (10 minutes or so total). I will need to purchase a second battery I think, hopefully I can find one with an external charger.- The time it takes to put together HDR, and especially panorama photos, is a pain. We're talking 5-10 seconds per HDR and 10-15 per Panorama after you take it before it will display it and you can use the camera again. And for panoramas it does a slow pan display of the entire photo, and you can't stop it to use the camera during that time from what I can see. Sure you can turn off the option to display the photos you have taken, but there's no way to turn it off only for panoramas.- The screen likes to display \"Check battery cover for foreign objects before using in water\" a lot. It actually did it to me WHILE I was snorkeling with the camera. So far I haven't had any problems with it in water, and I can't tell if that's just a generic safety message or if there are actually sensors in there that think the compartment is not secure.But don't let those neagtives drag you down! I would certainly not go back to my Canon PowerShot camera over this one ever.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ruggedized Camera that can't survive the surf?", "Author": "Fancydive", "ReviewID": "R1KGCZF0WSEDIF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've been using my Olympus TG-1iHS for a little over a month now.

For the last five years I have used a Canon Power Shot digital camera that gave great pictures.  But, the Cannon was not a go anywhere camera as is the Olympus TG-1 that I now have had for about 1 month. Also I have been limited in low light, fast action, and slow responce inside under flash.  I considered all of the major brands and read all that I could find on them as well as reviews like this one.  After about 600 pictures from my TG-1 I can say that I now have the camera I wanted and it meets my needs.There are other reviews that do a very through job of outlining the camera and so I want waste your time on the overall ability of the camera - it does it all while in a crush proof, water proof case. I have always had problems with low light both around water and while riding horse in the evening.  The TG-1 lens is low light and it will catch those sunsets and sunrises that I have been unable to take [only have a few left].  The sports mode works well for my grand children in track meets and when flash pictures are required in  concerts inside of buildings it works there also.  Even thought it has a very good zoom built in, I will be glad when the new longer range len is available.The above benefits are excellent, but I am also impressed with:-the feel when you hold it and the size for it fits on my belt.-the different modes available - I now am a professional by using these modes - the menu will just lead you through to fine the possibilities available and the understandable line that shows on the screen will make anyone comfortable in it's correct use.  These special effects or shooting modes is adding a different and professional look to my picure books. I never thought I would be able to get this type of effect in pictures but the TG-1 makes it easy.-the mode dial is in a place that will not turn when you are using or turn as you pull from you case as my canon camera did.-I have big hands and have had no problems with hand placement.-I like the big view screen that can be seen as well as any in bright sun light.-GPS is a nice addition as use GPS in remote places that I ride.-the picture quality is very good and I am not disappointed.

I specifically wanted a camera with a GPS to replace my existing Panasonic TS-2 because its lack of a GPS plus a clock with a lot of drift meant I was spending too much time in post-production geotagging photos.  I narrowed it down to the TG-1 and TS-4 and decided to try the TG-1 because of:1) Generally positive reviews2) F2.0 lens3) Nostalgia for my first real camera (an Olympus OM-1)I knew that the TG-1 came with no external charger but figured I would address that issue by ordering an accessory kit that came with a charger, spare battery and case.  The battery didn't seat properly in the charger so it failed to charge and the camera barely fit in the case.  One star for the accessory kit and minus half a star for the TG-1 guilt by association/manufacturer's decision to skip the charger in the first place.In terms of ergonomics, the TG-1 has the lens in the center, the shutter on top and the zoom on the back.  I could never get the hang of operating the zoom with my thumb while holding the camera one handed.  By contrast, the TS-2 has the lens offset to one side and the shutter and zoom on the top.  This made it relatively easy to operate both the shutter and zoom while holding the camera in one hand, a huge advantage while kayaking.  With the TS-3/4, Panasonic also moved the zoom controls to the back while leaving the lens offset to one side.  The TG-1 arrangement is probably better if you are left handed or prefer to shoot while holding the camera with two hands but for me, it was another minus half a star. It is also larger/less pocketable than the TS-x, not really a factor in my evaluation.In its favor, the TG-1 did take better sharper pictures that my TS-2 and presumably the TS-4.  I was also very satisfied with the video performance in ambient light and did not notice the clicking and noise that some other reviewers have mentioned.  The TG-1 never leaked in the three weeks I had it.  As I mentioned, I did not purchase it as an underwater camera so its underwater time was limited to:1) A couple of occasions where I accidentally knocked it off the deck.  The tether limited it to a depth of maybe a foot or two for a few seconds.2) A ten minute bath in lukewarm water after each adventure to rinse the salt offWith both the TS-2 and TG-1 I have been meticulous in keeping the seals clean and free of debris through liberal use of a Glottos Rocket-air blower and brush.  The TS-2 hasn't leaked in the two years I've had it, either. The TG-1 also survived an unexpected 2 foot drop onto pavement with no ill effects.On today's kayak trip, the TG-1 froze towards the end of the trip.  The LCD still displayed a picture but the camera would not respond to any controls.  After a few minutes, the picture on the LCD was replaced with an Olympus logo that remained there until got out off the water and power cycled the camera by popping the battery out and back in again.  As expected, this cleared the problem but it was not a maneuver I was willing to make out on the water.  Minus two stars for this episode.  I read on [...] that a firmware patch is available that supposedly addresses the stability issue while GPS is enabled.I've only got a few more days before the end of the 30 day Amazon return policy, not enough time to be fussing around with software updates.  For me, a camera that takes marginally worse pictures is better than a non-functional camera.

But seeing that the D20 lens is even slower than the D10, I passed. The TX20 gained some enhancements such as faster time to start recording video and improved playback, but the sensor and lens and overall operations are essentially the same. So passed on that as well.When I saw the specs on the TG-1, esp. the f2.0 lens and latest processor and tech, it looked like a sure winner.Unfortunately, once I took it to the beach and tried it out for a week, I found some weaknesses/issues that caused me to return the camera and stick with my TX10 and D10 for now.Here are the issues I have with this camera:- Video not as smooth and vibrant as Sony- Definite clicking sound in videos- Zooming during video shooting causes too much focus hunting- Panorama feature sucks ... the result is usually misaligned and takes 10 seconds to process, the Sony sweep panorama is the best in the industry- No A or S mode. Canon and Sony doesn't have this either. Why is it so hard to add A or S mode to the compact underwater cameras?- Camera locked up a few times, it would turn on but none of the controls worked, had to reset it- When I used the flash underwater, I often get flash reflection back to the lensThough the camera was fast and responsive, I wasn't overly impressed with the images and videos.

The pictures were amazing for a point and shoot.  For reference, my normal camera is a Canon 60D.  This replaced a Panasonic Lumix-TS2.  The video is especially good.  Considering this camera can go where DSLR can't (without waterproof housing and bulky), the quality is outstanding.  Underwater snorkeling photos and videos were excellent as were banana boat rides.  This would be very difficult with a DSLR.  The color saturation and focus was excellent as well.  It has lots of modes to take the best pictures based on the situation.  I found the iAuto did a good job of figuring out the scene and applying the right presets.  I liked that you can change various settings easily in P mode without drilling down through menus.  My only concerns were that it froze one day in the ocean and would not turn off or respond in any way.  Once I got to a dry area and pulled the battery out, and reinserted it, it worked fine.  I would also add that the battery seems to last an extremely long time for what I am used to.  One time after laying in the sand and letting the tides wash over me there was sand in the rubber gaskets on the door where you charge it.  Olympus recommends putting it in a bucket of fresh water and shaking it if you know it might have sand on it.  I did that from then on if I knew there was sand on the camera. On the last day of the trip I noticed the housing near the shutter button didn't seem to line up completely with the housing on the other side.  The camera worked correctly, and was still waterproof.  I can't be sure if it came this way and I just noticed it or not.  Because of the frozen screen, Olympus recommended I send the camera in for service.  As I am in the 30 day window I returned it to Amazon for a replacement.  Overall a great camera that did a great job.  Easily beats the Lumix TS2 in terms of quality, especially video.

After taking a variety of photos and video with the Olympus TG-1, I find it compares very well with typical point&shoot; cameras with the notable exception that the zoom range is only 25-100mm, whereas most point&shoots; have twice this range or better.  However, I find 25-100mm covers 99% of the photos I would take, and I am glad that it will shoot at a very wide angle.  While the marketing hype \"DSLR\" image quality is overstated, the image quality is good for a point&shoot; provided that the sun is not shining directly on the lens.  There is no lens hood, but you can solve this by shading the lens with your hand.  The video I have taken thus far is fine, and there is no \"popping\" noise as other reviewers have reported.  You can hear a low whirring sound while zooming the lens, but I think Olympus made the right choice by allowing optical zoom while recording.  Other manufactures \"solve\" the zoom noise problem by disabling optical zoom during video recording. I prefer to be able to zoom during videos, and I can deal with the noise with video editing.  The camera starts up and shoots quickly (under 2 seconds), the display screen is sharp and clear, and the menus and buttons work easily.  The HDR mode deals well with scenes having a wide range from light to dark.  Battery life is good.  This is an auto-everything camera with very little manual control, but the good news is that the auto-exposure, auto-focus, and auto-white-balance work well.  The f2.0 lens helps enormously with low-light conditions, and for close-in video, there is a bright LED light.  The LED light also helps the auto-focus in low-light, and you can manually turn the LED on to use it as a flashlight - very handy for composing pictures in low light.My gripes are relatively minor.  Like too many other cameras, the user manual is awful, explaining very little about what the many features and modes really do.  For example, there are four underwater \"scene\" modes: snapshot, wide1, wide2, and macro.  I can figure out that the macro mode is for focusing on closer objects, but the other 3 underwater modes are a mystery.  What effect do they have for auto-focus, auto-exposure, white-balance, shutter-speed, etc?  If anyone out there learns what the other underwater modes do, please post the answer to this riddle.The TG-1 provides manual exposure compensation, but no auto-bracketing like most other cameras, which can automatically take three photos at different exposure levels.  There is absolutely no way to adjust the f-stop; I wish there were.  However, the depth-of-field is quite wide even at f2.0.The auto-stitch panorama mode is okay for distant subject, but it is not as good as Sony cameras for closer panoramas, such as indoors.I wish there was a manual control for color saturation.  The colors are slightly muted in some photos.  Of course, this can be fixed by post editing.Overall, this rugged underwater camera serves very well as an everyday pocketable camera, and the image quality is surprisingly good for this type of camera.", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Pictures in Bad Situations", "Author": "Reefroamer \"reefroamer\"", "ReviewID": "R142ZQB754F7BA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Until someone figures out how to cram a full-frame digital SLR camera, strobe and fast superzoom lens into a rugged, waterproof body that fits in my pocket ... and do it all for under $400 ... I think the Olympus Tough TG-1 is a great choice for anyone looking to get nice photos at the beach, in the surf, during a downpour or on backpacking trip to the wilderness. This little guy fits in my pocket, is solidly-built, a very FAST shooter and is capable of producing excellent images if you work within its performance envelope (which is quite roomy, especially for a pocketable, tiny-sensor digital camera).I'm a pretty experienced photographer and have used many cameras. I live on an island and wanted a rugged, environmentally-sealed camera to use around the sand and salt water. These elements are hated enemies of the worst kind to most digital cameras and other electronic devices including my Canon 7D digital SLR and my Canon G12 and S90 point-and-shoots. The TG-1 thrives in this nasty environment. And did I mention it's FAST? Five frames per second at full 12MP resolution with virtually NO shutter lag. That's impressive in a small point-and-shoot camera. I've used mostly the P (Program) mode, with occasional tweaks to the exposure compensation, to get excellent, sharp results. As with any camera, I sometimes have to fool around a bit to find the \"sweet spot\" for the best possible image. Compared to the \"rugged\" Canon and Nikon models, I believe the TG-1 is better built, faster and has a better lens. I'm completely satisfied with the TG-1 images, considering its cost and size.I give it five stars for doing what I wanted it do, and more.You can find in other reviews discussing all the \"cons\" for the TG-1 (though they usually apply to other rugged cameras, too). Most of these drawbacks are, in my opinion, pretty small nits for most users. Most of us can live without RAW image capability in most situations. The lack of manual exposure capability is seldom a drawback that can't be worked around with the Program mode. I picked up a $25 accessory kit from Amazon for the TG-1 that included two extra batteries, a small plug-in wall charger, a vehicle adapter, screen protectors and a lens cloth. Highly-recommended if you don't like charging the single included battery in the camera via USB. I've also ordered the ultra-wide Fisheye lens converter and adapter ring just to play with for some more extreme shots. Sure, Olympus could put all this in the box and raise the price, but many people will be completely satisfied as the TG-1 is shipped. There's also an available, inexpensive underwater housing if you plan to go more than a few feet down in the ocean. In my own experience, as a diver, these housings are great underwater but the housing camera controls and added bulk make them clumsy for regular topside use.So I'm completely happy with the TG-1 for my purposes, and recommend it as a good choice if you want to take nice images in places where other cameras are ill-suited. Is it perfect? No camera is for everyone in every situation. Whatever camera you finally buy, shoot lots of images, take the time to experiment and learn its strengths and weaknesses, then use the strengths and avoid the weaknesses. Delete your bad shots (and we all have them!) and keep the good stuff. The TG-1 will get you some good stuff where others fail.", "Date": "October 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "New freedom in photography", "Author": "Amir Ridhwan", "ReviewID": "R1B3UBAFN3VMP6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went for a 2-week trip to Laos recently and was looking for a compact as a back up camera. After heaving digging on reviews I chose the TG-1 as it is the only waterproof camera with an f/2.0 lens. Other desirable specs such as GPS and manometer are equally enticing.What happened during the trip was something unexpected. I ended up using the TG-1 more that my DSLR (which I brought with 4 lenses and a flash). I dipped it into a stream, took shots of waterfall where the water splash and used it at the dusty bus terminal of Vientiane. I was very careful when using DSLR or MILS cameras but with TG-1 I just shoot and shoot without worry. For the first time I tasted the freedom of shooting in such conditions with acceptable toll on image quality.The 25mm wide angle lens is nice albeit some obvious distortion at the edges. Buildings look nicely warped but human head are rather distorted. If you frame it a bit away from the corner (you'll know where exactly after some test shots), it will be a fine wide 25mm perspective.The super macro with LED is simply amazing. First of all I am an avid macro photographer. I own 2 macro lenses and had my works exhibited in several countries. Being rather picky about macro quality I didn't expect this camera to deliver anything acceptable for macro. But how I was surprised! The super macro mode will not fire the flash but can use a small LED to illuminate the subject. If you can just get control the hand vibration, the result is stunning. It's not comparable to DSLR with macro lens and flash but very impressive for a compact. I took quite a number of macro with it just for fun. My favourite shot was a spider portrait sitting static on water surface which I shot with the camera half submerged.I haven't shot a lot of videos with it. I read earlier there are some gripes on it's video capability. The few I shot were just fine- no complaint. I even took some macro videos of wrigglers feeding in a rock pool and those footages are good enough for me.Last week I took it as a third camera when doing a wedding assignment. I didn't shoot a lot with it (DSLR and MILS definitely have significant advantage in this area) but I got some very nice candids using the TG-1. People tend to be less intimidated when you shoot them with a compact that that way I got nice \"hello\" photos on wide angle. I even shot several breathtaking panoramas of the crowd, something I can't do with the other cameras.At the price I am really pleased with the purchase. I got many great images which I have never dreamt of obtaining without a waterproof camera. In the past I dislike waterproof cameras as the image quality is noticibly compromised. This little guy just turned me into something else.Now the TG-1 sticks in a pouch on my belt whenever I go out. The 2 DSLRs and OM-D stays in the drybox, only to be picked up on weekends.

L.\"", "ReviewID": "R2OEH09XQXZBD4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd dedicated waterproof point and shoot and counting cased cameras the 5th waterproof camera I've used.  As far as the dedicated WP cameras I do think this one is the best so far, but there still seems to be a lot of compromisesThere is a great review on CNET that I thought was pretty helpful.  (Can't put in links so would just Google CNET waterproof camera).As far as the Olympus TG-1The Olympus TG-1 is a little bulky but it is very fast and appears very tough.  So far it has survived several surfing trips and a trip to thailand.  There is  very little shutter lag (fastest of any point and shoot I've ever used), so taking pictures of action is very easy.  The burst feature is very good (very fast actually, if it is on burst, it is difficult to take less than 3 pictures).  The photoquality is good, but intermittently the pictures are a bit soft (look a little like 1980's era wedding photos...not great)--especially skin tones, this is intermittent although does happen frequently.  One other issue is that often the pictures are a bit dark and shadows have a lot of contrast.  Often they look better after some reduction of shadows or contrast in photoshop or iPhoto.  The window for the lens is much bigger so the problem with water drops in the field of view when transitioning from water to air is reduced, but still present.  The locking mechanism for the waterproof doors on the TG-1 is very nice.  Having one camera lost to the hatch opening, I really like the double locking mechanism.  I wish there was only one door, but these appear to be very well secured compared to everything else.  There are several manual features, and while a little gimmicky, the preset creative modes are actually fun (I thought I wouldn't like them, but they actually are pretty neat).I haven't used the attachments or the deep water case, and I'm not planning to since this is largely used for shallow water.  Also, I don't shoot video so I haven't run into the commonly cited problems of poor audio.  The lack of a charger and the proprietary cable are big drawbacks.  It is really annoying to have to carry the cable traveling and always worrying about losing it.  The larger aperture is nice for decreasing the need for a slow shutter speed, but one interesting problem is that sometimes it does limit the depth of field, which can make pictures interesting creating nice bokeh in the background, but often in a point and shoot with little control it can make some of the aspects of the photo appear blurry when you don't want it.  It is a little double edged.  Also, the autofocus does frequently focus near (often on water) which is a little bit of a problem when the depth of field is a little more narrow than the usual point and shoot.Also, I'm not sure if this is an apple issue, but I cannot get the GPS to work correctly even after installing the software.  I don't use it, but if I did I'd be pretty upset.  It is not intuitive to get to the data, and is not easy to use.  I find it nearly useless, but potentially I just haven't spent enough time figuring it out (although I feel you really shouldn't have to spend so much time).Overall I do really like the camera, far from perfect, but I do think the best one so far.Pros1. Very fast, almost no shutter lag.2. Great Burst feature.3. Good photoquality to great photoquality  (not excellent, and sometimes bad)4. Appears very tough, and has been so far.5. Larger aperture, faster shutter speedCons1. Big, bulky.2. expensive3. Proprietary cable, no charger.4. Inconsistent photo quality, sometimes too soft, sometimes too much contrast.  Frequent need for correction with post processing software.5. GPS is not intuitive if it really works at all, ends up being not useful.In the end:  While this is the best to date (in my opinion, and at least the best I've used), it still may be better as far as photoquality to buy a regular point an shoot and a waterproof case.  I do have to say that for my hopes for this camera, I am pretty disappointed.  It is very good, but I guess I expected more.  It's not that much better than others, and there are some features of others that are more convenient.  The Sony Cybershot is a very close second so far, and does have some better qualities at least for how I use the camera.  It might be a better deal although has its own problems.Just for information, in comparison with other cameras (just to demonstrate issues with other cameras):Most WP cameras eventually fail.  So far The cameras I have used, have about a 3 year life, with very regular use.  Reading reviews it appears that should probably be the expectation.Previously tried the Olympus Stylus Tough 720, (from 2006) which took very good pictures, but shutter lag was a problem and burst was very slow.  it was difficult to take action shots.  After 3 years of using the camera largely for surfing (which I think is harder than most uses), it did finally leak and fail, but it did survive a long time and made it through a few drops.  I did like it a lot though, and it is why I tried olympus again.Next was the cased Fuji FinePix F200EXR.  Good camera, interesting sensor technology, but while it does sometimes take great pictures, it often takes very noisy pictures even at low ISO.  Too big to fit in a wetsuit sleeve when cased, so not really useful when surfing.  This was largely replaced with DSLR when not in the water, and I had to find another WP camera.  Great point and shoot most of the time, but can have very noisy images.Next the Sony Cybersthot DSC TX10 WP.  This is by far the smallest of the WP cameras and very sleek.  Works great outside of the water, good low light function, great burst feature.  Nearly no shutter lag.  The problem is the photo quality.  It is incredibly variable (the much cheaper canon digital elph is consistently better).  Sometimes just moving the camera, changing the angle will change the metering in the camera and the photo will come out completely different, and there aren't many options for manual settings.  Still, the photo quality is good to very good, it is very handy and easy to use.  Very nice in the water because it is so light, small and easy to put away when waves are coming.  Drawbacks were that it was difficult to get drops of water off the lens in the transition from water to shooting in the air, but this appears to happen with all of them.  The paint came off the front cover after 1.5 years (kind of strange and a bit annoying), and after 3 years the battery compartment sprang open in the water and it died.  I would consider getting the newer version of this camera mainly due to size, ease of use and speed, but variable photoquality was a drawback.Others tried:  Canon digital Elph SD1300, which can be used with a case.  Honestly, while fairly inexpensive, I think this is one of the best point and shoots there is.  Very good quality photos, consistent, and very easy to use.  Minimal manual options, but it's not really used for that anyway.  Cases tend to be very bulky, and they are expensive.  Camera + Case is the same price as most WP cameras if not a little more.I have not tried the Nikon, Canon, Pentax, or Panasonic.  Nikon and Panasonic appear to have good reviews, although variable (especially nikon).  The older Canon WP camera is pretty bulky, and there were a lot of waterproofing failures in the reviews.  The newer one may be better.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "perfect for the adventurous people", "Author": "k_llanto", "ReviewID": "R2N091AAQPHXS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the latest in the Olympus tough series, this is my first weatherproof camera. upon receiving it, i'm off to palm spring to test some of its claimed talents. waterproof - yes, this got some of my family's most funniest pool jump shots, the video and underwater shots are very clear.

Expensive camera, but the memories are priceless.", "Author": "N. Hoang \"Potstickr\"", "ReviewID": "R5XZRU0XUHO45", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We took our Olympus TG-1 on a recent trip to Cancun and it performed admirably both in and out of the water!  We didn't feel comfortable taking our Canon 60D on the trip and needed a new waterproof camera to replace our Kodak PlaySport that stopped charging (a known issue with the PlaySport that couldn't be remedied by any of the solutions I found online).I spent weeks researching cameras and narrowed it down to the Olympus TG-1, Canon D20, and Panasonic TS-4.  The Panny tends to receive a lot of reports of leakage.  Many sites praise the image quality of the Canon D20 and we almost bought it, but I didn't care for its look and design.  The Canon D20 and Olympus TG-1 are not cheap cameras and, for that amount of money, I wanted a camera that we could use at the beach or underwater, as well as at a wedding without looking like we brought a toy camera.  Plus, I really appreciate having a fast lens on the Olympus.  We used to have a Canon SD870is and liked that a lot, but quickly found its lens limiting in low-light environments such as a play, concert, or aquarium.  I didn't want us to make the same mistake with the Canon D20.The Olympus's F2.0 lens is marvelous!  For environments where we couldn't, or don't want to, take our DSLR the TG-1 allowed us to take action shots and great indoor shots without resorting to harsh flash lighting.  Some sites complained about exposure issues with the TG-1, but we found the metering to be accurate and the camera produced sharp and wonderful shots both in and out of the water.In Cancun we used the TG-1 on bright sunny days, under cloudy skies, inside dimly lit dinner stage shows, in the rain, in and out of the pool and ocean, and on a river through caves.  Out of 800 photos, only 3 shots showed a waterdrop on the lens.  In all environments the camera performed beautifully and the P and SCN modes really helped to quickly dial in the correct settings to suit the situation.  I absolutely know we would've missed many great shots of our daughter splashing in the pool if we had the Canon D20 or Panasonic TS-4 that both have slower lenses.  The dedicated movie button is also great and very convenient for immediately starting and stopping recording so you don't miss the moment while trying to switch between modes.  While swimming with stingrays and nurse sharks, I used the \"Underwater 2\" mode to record video underwater and did not notice any \"ticking\" noises reported in other reviews.Out of the box, the Olympus did look a little big but you quickly get used to it.  On our trip, the size of the camera was never an issue and it felt like carrying around any other point-and-shoot.  What I particularly liked is that it didn't scream \"waterproof camera\" and many other tourists cautioned us \"not to get our camera wet\", to our chagrin.The battery life is also amazing compared to the Kodak PlaySport.  Back when our PlaySport was working, it needed to be recharged after 1.5-2.0 hours of use.  The Olympus lasted us the first 3 days of our vacation before needing to be charged.  Even with constant shooting and video recording during an all-day (7am-10pm) tour to Xcaret Eco Park, the Olympus lasted the entire trip and finally ran out of juice just as we were returning to our hotel.  We had backup battery packs so we didn't try to conserve battery life when using the camera.  Still, we were able to take 150 pictures that day in Xcaret and 5GB of video on a single charge with the stock battery!I still think the Olympus is rather expensive, but the camera really did deliver on its toughness and allowed us to capture beautiful memories of our vacation in all situations.

We are replacing a 8010 that we have owned for about 5 years and had an unfortunate trip into the pool with a hatch open.The camera has not dissapointed after a trip to the water park, an amusement park and our pool.  The feature to be able to shoot up to 60 fps at a lower resolution is pretty wild and has given us lots of options for thing like coming down a water slide or jumping into the pool.  Even the sports setting has got a great work out.  I chased around my nephew for a good 20 minutes as he played in the park in a water fountain area and was able to have lots of options.I was able to test out the low light abilities of the camera with the kids while they blew out a birthday cake and played with sparklers over the Fourth of July. While I am not ready to put down my SLR yet, I am impressed with the quality of the pictures and how it has handled a number of different environments.One thing to keep in mind is that the GPS needs to be set up first and you will need a computer with full functionality.  Not a big deal - reading the instructions in the manual will guide you through the process but it is apparently not ready to be used out fo the box.I have also been impressed with the battery life.  I had no issues with the battery running out - my biggest issue with the old 8010.  I intend to have a couple spares but I do not think I will have to swap them out as frequently as I have in the past.I also have tried the camera with the EYEfi and it synched right up without an issue.  This was kind of nice in that I could them pull pictures faster to give to family members before they left.  The camera can automatically tell if I have the card in there or a spare card that I maintain.The modes are very nice for the camera.  I could see using the dramatic filter often as it really brings out the shadows and makes a pretty picture.Also, the panoramic option can do vertical and horizontal which creates additional creative freedom where I was only used to horizontal panoramics.I have ordered the lens attachment and look forward to trying the fisheye lens when it arrives.  Based upon my experience with that one, I will decide if I want the telephoto lens when it becomes available.The only issue I really have is that the carry strap would be more practical if there was a way to cinch it closed.  I solve this with a rubber band to ensure the camera does not come of my hand when I am swimming or taking pictures in a ray tank at the aquarium.Update 8/28/12The camera has been through an extensive test this summer.  I have both the FCON and TCON to provide extra flexibility and my only critique is for the zoom lens.  The unit has to bee almost completely zoomed in or you get significant vignetting.  Since I am using it to expand the zoom, it has not been a huge issue.I was able to test it in low light conditions on the football field last Friday.  Great pictures under the lights.  Normally, I have trouble shooting even with my SLR after half time.  I am hoping that I might have additional flexibility with this camera with the F2 as my long lenses have much higher f-stops.As far as the pool, the camera continues to take wonderful pictures of the family enjoying the summer with our guests, friends and family.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Outdoor, Indoor, Underwater Camera", "Author": "M.

Ruggedized cameras traditionally sacrifice image quality for improved survivability, but the TG-1 manages both with aplomb. The new f/2.0 wide-zoom lens design, BSI sensor, improved low-light performance, and powerful image processor returns better image quality than some mid-range general purpose cameras. I owned the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS3 for about a year, and I used a Fujitsu XP50 for a few rafting trips, and I can say with confidence that the Olympus Tough TG-1 is all around the best tough camera I've come across.While the TG-1 is larger than typical point-and-shoot cameras, it feels good to hold and isn't heavy. In my opinion, it feels lighter than it looks--while it looks like a metal block, the camera is actually constructed of composite materials. Overall, I found the TG-1 easy and unobtrusive to carry, even in jacket or cargo pockets during all-day excursions, and I found that it's easy to handle even with thin gloves. I have big hands, and I appreciate the buttons' distinct profiles and good tactile feedback when pressed.The TG-1's interface shares design elements with recent Olympus cameras, which is a good thing since the menu system looks good and is generally intelligently categorized. Unfortunately, Olympus saw fit to burden the TG-1 with a bunch of unnecessary eye-candy such as full-color graphics, animations, scrolling photos/text, and slide-out menus. While this might impress potential buyers, advanced users will be put off by the extra visualizations since they don't add functional value and ultimately make the interface feel slow. While the menu keeps up with rapid button presses (the previous animation will be stopped when you interrupt it with another key press), I prefer instant-response and plain menus. Actual shooting performance--auto focus and shot-to-shot times are quick, which is essential for this class of camera, though power-on-to-first-shot time could use improvement. Strangely enough, the TG-1 is really slow going into review mode.There was a time even basic point-and-shoot cameras offered PASM modes (Canon PowerShot SX150), and personally, I think it's a tragedy that the TG-1 omits all meaningful forms of manual control. The TG-1 has a capable lens, sensor, and image processor, and it opens a new realm of underwater shooting, though we are unable to fully explore the photographic possibilities. While scene modes give you some \"control\" over your shooting such as the \"Night Snapshot\" favoring slower shutter speeds, you still cannot independently adjust the shutter speed, aperture, or focus. Shame on you, Olympus!Overall, I'm pleased with the Olympus TG-1, though the lack of manual control is really a sore spot. I initially bought the TG-1 to go to places where I wouldn't want to bring my OM-D, though I discovered that I've been using it more than I originally anticipated. There's a saying that the best camera in the world is the one that's with you, and with its waterproof/shockproof qualities, surprisingly long battery life, and good picture quality, it's very likely that the Olympus TG-1 will be that camera.Notes:1) While I say the Olympus TG-1 has great image quality, this is from the perspective of ruggedized cameras. Ruggedized cameras do not deliver the best image quality at a particular price point...for example, the Panasonic DMC-GF3C and Olympus XZ-1 blow it away, but neither is waterproof.2) The camera DOES NOT come with a dedicated battery charger, which is somewhat annoying. The battery is charged in-camera with one of the waterproof doors open which exposes it to dust, etc. External chargers and extra batteries are available.3) The user manual is only given in electronic format. This camera is complex enough to warrant a printed manual.4) The lens is a 25mm to 100mm equivalent, f/2.0 to f/4.9. If you're not careful, it's easy to accidentally slip a finger into the frame due to the recessed design. Zooming is slow, somewhat jerky, and a little noisy. Purple fringing is a bit of an issue, but I can certainly live with it.5)  Super Macro Mode is excellent. It zooms to 89mm equivalent and offers nearly 1:1 magnification and extremely close focus. I could take pictures of my monitor's sub-pixels (red/green/blue dots)!6) The built-in GPS serves primarily to geo-tag photos and is reasonably accurate. It takes a few minutes to lock-on and you won't get information like speed, heading, etc. Log files are recorded in NEMA format. The landmark database works internationally! If you hold the menu button, the camera will jump to the GPS screen with longitude/latitude information. A-GPS is available, though you need to download a tool from Olympus's site and update the camera every 14 days.7) Olympus - More colors please! The DMC-TS3 looked great in orange.8) Underwater, the camera performs well in automatic mode, though the screen's view angles become quite narrow due to reflections. You pretty much need to be behind the screen while shooting underwater. The waterproof doors on the Olympus appear to be more robust than those on my old DMC-TS3.9) High-speed burst mode is impressive - 5 fps at full resolution, up to 60 fps at 3MP.10) Battery Life is Awesome. You can use it all day with the GPS enabled and not really worry about the battery dying. An extra battery would be helpful for all day/all night excursions though.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works great...while it works...", "Author": "Brian F.

Just on a whim, we started looking to see if there was a newer model to get for our upcoming vacation. After research and finding out that the TS3 (and TS4) added features but was a downgrade in some respects, I started looking at other brands.The feature that had me considering this camera over all others regardless of price was the f2.0 lens. That means that when zoomed all the way out, it lets about 1.5x more light into the camera than the other underwater cameras. That's a big deal when shooting underwater in the ocean and getting down around the 20' deep mark. It also helps allot with low-light videos since the flash won't do you any good in that situation.So, did it help? Heck yeah. For comparison, I took a picture in the bedroom with the blinds drawn and no flash with both this TG-1 and our TS2 at the same time. I set both to ISO 400. The TG1 took the shot with a shutter speed of 1/30 but the TS2 had to drop to 1/15 shutter speed! Even more noticeable was just the LCD preview on both cameras. The TS2 had to slow the shutter down to keep the LCD preview bright which resulted in the preview frame rate dropping and looking stutterish. The TG1 still looked silky smooth.This camera feels really good. It's got a good weight to it and the size is about perfect. Having the lens in the middle is an obvious benefit as it results in less fingers over the lens when taking pictures. The LCD is awesome. It's big, high res and bright as heck. With our old TS2, I had to kind of use instinct to keep it centered on a fish when zooming in underwater as the LCD was too low res and dim to use for detail work. With the TG1 it is like night and day. I can use it as good underwater as above in that respect now.The picture quality on this camera is just great. When we bought our TS2 a few years back, its reputation for taking good pictures above water as well as under was the biggest factor in our choice and at the time, it was the best. This Olypus puts it to shame now though. This TG1 takes as good of pictures in all shooting situations as any other point and shoot I have ever used. The faster lens allows a lower ISO to be used which means a sharper picture. We do also own a DSLR but the ability to take just one small camera is important to us.It has some neat gimmicky modes like taking a picture when it sees a dog's face, fish-eye distortion and many more. Some are actually pretty cool and I would use here and there. I was Very impressed with the panorama shot mode. The GPS functions pretty well and is neat. The Macro is pretty darn good and has a mode which will illuminate with a LED while shooting up close. Some complained of the controls being too small. I did not have this complaint and I have very big hands. I will say that I wish the function select dial was raised a little more. It starts up very fast and takes pictures quickly. Except waiting for the flash to recharge, there is no delay between taking shots.The video mode is pretty good. Auto focus likes to jump around too much at times but there may be a setting for that that I haven't found yet. It uses a CMOS sensor and there is some jello-effect but not too bad. It resolves pretty well at 1080p and records to quicktime .mov files in h.264 at about 19Mbps combined (Audio and Video) bitrate. The codec falls apart some with motion but it's bearable.There are only two things I didn't like about this camera. The first is silly and easily remedied but I didn't like the strap that comes with it. It is big and very strong BUT the loop for your wrist is a fixed size. When taking a camera underwater, I prefer a strap that you can adjust to tighten on your wrist after you put it on. That way, I know there's no way it will slip off.The second negative aspect of this camera is that you have to charge the battery while in the camera using the proprietary USB cable provided. I finally found an after market battery and charger combo that claims to be compatible with the TG1 and it should be shipping today. I'm really hoping it works.I haven't had any leaks yet but also haven't used it extensively yet. The seals look robust. I will update this review in a few weeks after our vacation in which it will get much use at depths of 20' and more. I know how to take care of these seals and our old Panasonic is still dry every time on the original seals.As of right now, I cannot recommend this camera enough. It costs a bit more than the others but it's worth it.Edit: We just got back from a 7 day Eastern Caribbean cruise. The camera took very nice underwater photos and decent video. I mentioned that the video codec doesn't do motion very well and that is even more noticeable underwater due to the complexity of a coral floor and the uniform blue of the water background. There are tons of artifacts that pop up under movement untill the next I-Frame. I have no idea what the exact Codec in use is but it must be baseline profile if AVC. I think it is bad enough that even the average person will notice that something isn't right.The deepest I was able to take the camera down was about 27.5 feet as the camera readout reported it. I didn't have any issues with water intrusion. I did have one issue however with sand that I'm not sure is a design flaw, problem with my camera or just the extreme conditions of the particular beach I was at. After spending a few hours at Maho beach in St Maarten, I had sand in every pocket of my swimsuit. It turns out, I also had sand in the outer casing of the camera. Some of the sand got jamed in the shutter button causing it to be permanently half pushed which made no other function buttons work. Eventually, I was able to shake that sand free and the camera works again but you can hear tons of sand rattling around in it if you shake it. The inner waterproof casing has not been compromised to my knowledge however.I will exchange the camera (Hopefully) and see how it goes.Update: We exchanged the camera and have had no issues yet with sand intrusion. We also haven't put it through what it went through at St Martin so who knows. We are still very happy with the camera.Update: As of July 2013, we have used this camera on many beaches, salt water, mud runs and dusty construction sites with no issues. The sand in the outer case problem has not reoccurred either.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Truth Hurts...

The monopod to stabilize is key in low light to help eliminate camrea shake, but when you combine that with the fast lens it did awesome!  Took lots of photos of the Tut exhibit at the Pac science center- dark conditions with well lit exhibits, but the pictures were very sharp considerig a point and shoot. Night and twilight pictures of the space needle were also very good.I havent tested the waterproofing or rugged features, and I dont actually intent to drop it, or take it underwater- but im a klutz, I often want to shoot in the rain, and I need something that wont get smashed in my luggage when I travel and this seems to fit the bill.One word of advice when choosing a rugged/waterproof- many of them have the lens in the upper corner of the camera- you wont beleive how easy it is to get your fingers in the picture until you use one- i know from expereince. This has the lens in the middle of the camera, i strongly urge you to consider a model with this feature. The compartment doors are DOUBLE locked, which feels much more secure than the average, and the doors themselves seem to be stronger than typical- so many of them have cheap plastic doors.The fast lens produced much higher quality pictures than the fujis I tried. no contest. Yes, yes, its not a DSLR. NONE of the rugged P&S; are going to give you that kind of image quality. Its more a factor of using good glass and good technique. If you absolutely MUST have lazer sharp pictures, pony up for a DSLR, good lenses, and classes to learn how to get the most out of them. The shots I got were perfectly acceptable, and I don't regret this purchase at all. Maybe slightly on the expensive side, and difficult to find- but worth it, and the prices may come down after septemer when Photokina 2012 rolls around and the new models are put out.One other really nice feature is the OLED screen on the back- its gorgeous, and easy to see even in bright sunlight which is not true of most LEDs on P&S;'s.For now, this little camera is hard to beat.Again though- spend some time experienmenting, learning some fundamentals of Photography, and invest in a simple inexpensive tripod or monopod and ball head, and you;ll get some great results.One tip for good low light pictures- put the camera on lockdown on a tripod, and use the timer. Press the button and let the vibrations from pressing the button disappate while the timer runs, and the pictures will be just a tiny bit sharper. Its a little thing but it does seem to help.Enjoy!", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Tough handy camera", "Author": "K.

I wanted a smaller camera that I could put in my pocket and take on hikes with my dog, to the dog park, use in the rain of Seattle, take photos of my pet fishes, not worry about it in bars when I go see bands, etc. I researched for a long time and settled on this. I like Canon, and Olympus for cameras. All my analog and digital cameras have been Olympus except for my Canon 20D. I do like this camera a lot, but there is ONE kinda big detriment (in my opinion) and that is that the on/off button is right next to the button used to take photos!! Poor design on Olympus' part in this ONE aspect! I have turned off my camera untold times on accident right when I was trying to get a shot. I have small hands and fingers, too. Part of that may be the fact that I usually use only one hand and am moving the camera around a lot but nonetheless I have never had this issue with any other camera I've had and this is a pricey item to have that kind of basic design flaw. Other than that, the only other issue I've had is that flash doesn't always work when I want it to, but this may indeed be my fault in some way. I have not paid attention to the whole little manual that came with it. It's a FUN camera overall, and you can beat the thing up and nothing will go wrong. It's been wet, dropped, hot, cold, etc. and it did kinda fog up one time but only for a second or two. I like not having to think about being careful with a camera, and I like putting it in my pocket. It's a little big for a shirt pocket, but it fits great in a back pocket when hiking or playing with dogs. It has tons of settings that you can play with plus preset modes which are fun. I've taken many videos with it and it does a good job in low light with live bands, dogs playing, and other videos. The sound isn't great with music, but then again there is always talking going on when I go see bands. It's pretty good otherwise and has a \"wind reduction\" setting that helps. I have never charged the battery since I got it. I have never used a card in it, I just use the internal memory which is a lot.

Furthermore, I used the videography function quite a bit upon purchase and thought that the camera was malfunctioning because of the interference noise and capturing of mechanical sound when using the zoom when taking videos.

It's water proof and shockproof (I dropped it off a rock and into a puddle on my first trial run and it had no problems) and has a lot of cool features on top of that. It has settings to take pictures in low light, great portraits, great landscape pictures (this setting enhances shades of green and blue to make nature pop) and all of the camera settings are easy to get to. Furthermore, there's a turn-wheel navigation to get to the most commonly used settings quickly, and two of the settings are customize-able, so you can save your preferences for quick use.The only gripe I have with this camera(and only reason it didn't get 5 stars) is when playing back a video I recorded, there's a hard to ignore ticking sound in the background.

The camera produces the panoramic internally so that you don't need to worry about post processing.I don't like the fact that the lense doesn't have a lense cover. It supposedly has a protective coating on the lens but I still worry about scratches when it is stored in a case or sack. Also the glass covering the LED screen on the back cracked on my first camera when I put it in a back pack with another camera. For a shock proof camera it didn't hold up very well. But I sent it back to Olympus and they replaced the glass for free!!! In the meantime I bought another camera (this one from Amazon) for my girlfriend.The camera has a great video ability with full 1080p resolution. But this really fills up the SD card fast. So watch out.The underwater ability is really good. The TAP to control feature takes some getting used to and for the most part, unless you are on an actual scuba dive where you can remain steady, I just take the picture normally by pressing the shutter button. Underwater shots are generally really great. I have come across instances where it seems difficult to get a really vibrant underwater shot due to the delay in shutter response, light gathering ability, and differences in water quality. All of this can be overcome with proper picture taking techniques though. It just takes some getting used to.Overall I recommend this camera. In fact I think it seems better than the TG-2.

I took this on a parasailing trip and a boat ride, and my share my thoughts on its practicality below:LIKES:+f2.0 lens+several in-camera creative filters and scene modes+GPS+serious about shock and water resistance, well-built, with some heft+relatively compact size+macro, super macro, and super macro with LED light support+relatively fast auto focus and generally good auto \"point and shoot\" mode+LCD screen was fairly easy to see, except in the most brightest conditions+ability to record 1080i HD video with stereo soundYIKES:-Buttons and dials on the back (especially the right side) way too crowded.  The thumb rest is right below the zoom control, so every time I rested my thumb with some pressure, I ended up activating the zoom.-Small-ish dials have a nice, durable feel, but very small knob and buttons.  Maybe fine for beach and poolside, but if you're wearing ski gloves, \"fuggedaboutit!\".-Picture quality is underwhelming, considering the fast lens.  Perhaps it's not paired with the right processor or sensor?  I have a S90 with a f2,0 and it takes truly remarkable pics.-Menus are too cumbersome to operate, not quite intuitive/user-friendly, particularly considering this is an outdoors enthusiast's point-and-shoot.-Microphone is on the top left, too easily covered by fingers using a natural holding position.-Panorama mode should be easier to use like Sony's \"sweep panorama\", instead it makes you align each shot.  Try aligning a shot while you're climbing a rock or parasailing... It appears that the design team needed to get some real outdoors experiences before going to the design table.-Lack of easily accessible \"quick menus\" to toggle frequently used functions on/off (like GPS, image quality/resolution, burst shot, etc.)VERDICT:I very much wanted to keep it, but the various execution flaws add up to a less than enthusiastic experience with many lost shots and lost opportunities for shots because of the cumbersome menu, buttons that are too close together.  At just over $400, with taxes, it's too many clams to keep an \"almost there\" product, despite being quite without par in the market (but it's a niche market).

At full optical and electronic zoom the PIX are razor sharp while the dual stability system (I have a tremor) isfar superior to my new Sony RX100, HX20V and Canon SX260's. Depth of field is impressive and low light performance at nearly as good as the aforementioned others. Shot a PIX in a totally black outdoors with the flash, it looked like late afternoon lighting. Olympus is noted for their sharp lenses (I have an E-P3) and low light performance, didn't expect this good in a P&S.;The only downside is a 7-10X optical zoom would be nice, but its a great little box anyway.It is a little \"chunky\" but solid in-hand and a nice hold...and built for a thermo-nuke explosion (;-).It must be extremely popular, I searched for two days to find one.

I assumed a GPS camera would do the job, but the coordinates are stored in \"metadata\" and there is no way to incorporate them into the picture or the caption without using complicated third-party software.  It's infuriating.  The camera has so many functions that border on frivolous (i.e. cat-face recognition), but why would anyone want GPS if not to share the coordinates?  (The customer service rep explained that people don't want the option of sharing the coordinates.  If so, why are there so many third party programs- EXIFTool, Gpic Sync etc. designed to do the job?)  Considering the data is stored in the camera, the fact that Olympus didn't bother to allow reasonable access to it seems bewilderingly stupid.

Right out of the box I liked the camera but wanted to wait till after a trip to Disney to really see how it preformed. I shoot almost everything with pro-level Canon bodies and L series lenses but wanted something I could carry around on vacation without the fear of rain on bumps damaging the camera. This thing did great. The first two days we walked around in Hurricane Debbie and the rain never bothered the camera. I even got some cool shots because I did not care about the camera getting wet. On the third day my daughter was in the pool with a bunch of dance friends (They were there to dance in Dance The World for Disney). The kids had a great time taking pictures in the pool. When we got back to the room I dried the outside and checked under the seals and nothing. Completely dry under both doors. We put the pictures on my MacBook and the underwater pictures were great.During the main dance event I did shoot with my high end Canon DSLR. Later in the week they repeated the same number on a different stage so I decided to play with this little gem during that performance. All I can say is WOW. I put the camera in high-speed mode and it froze the dancers. The picture is a bit flat but hay it is a tough camera what do you want.Latter in the night I decided to try the fireworks setting out shooting the show over Cinderella's castle.

When I bought it there was a minor speck. Keep in mind though that I work in a very dusty environment, so that there were only one or two small specks was awesome.I bought this camera for it's weather-sealed feature, but being that it's not keeping the dust out, it's a let down. I'm sure the dust is causing problems in macro, but I don't notice anything yet, but then again I'm not scrutinizing the pics at the moment.It has also become worn quickly, and has a little paint missing now on the left hand upper corner, some faint scratches on the LCD screen and on the protective lens cover.There is also another problem with this camera: it won't focus right often and it must be turned off to refocus correctly. I don't know if that is a software problem or manufacturing defect or refurbishing failure problem. It just stays blurred.I can't say I am impressed with anything about it for the price. I also noticed that in 1080p the motion on the LCD was like a slow motion camera from the 1800's, choppy.I like that for $300 you can get high resistance to dust and that I was able to wipe the dust away with my glove in a dusty desert after maybe ten strokes, but it's a dust magnet at the same time and it just piled on there after the wind gusted a few more times if I held it at the wrong angle (because dust would pile on the black ring around the lens and if the wind blew dust that was on the body somewhere, including the inside of the lens ring where it gathers much, onto the lens). I would like if Olympus coated the lens with some sort of anti-static coating, or pre-installed a screen protector and included a spare if it wasn't put on right or if dust got under it while it was put on or for when it wore out. The LCD was also a dust magnet.Washing it under water caused it no problems.It is a great cheap solution though for horrible environments, defintely something great for kids, who are likely to rough handle and destroy fragile cheap cameras. I dropped this from about 2 feet on a hard floor of some sort, vinyl I think, and there was no apparent exterior damage, but maybe the drop is what caused the focus problems I'm experiencing.The zoom is pathetic, and the \"super zoom\" is not very good, it shows things as a muddy mess.I haven't done much night shooting with it.Best of what I like about this camera is you can just run it under water for a quick washing and how easy it is to adjust the settings. It's the best I've ever used, not hard to figure out. I didn't like that the spot focus setting is buried in the menu though, I would like if that were in what I call the instant menu (the one that shows on the screen while the image is still being displayed).What I like best about this is that I can run it under water for a quick washing away of the dust and dirt and even lather it up and not have to worry about it being damaged inside from that.Update: I've noticed sometimes the camera doesn't remember the last settings you had it on when turning it off, and it resets the AF to face tracking, which is very annoying for me since I don't do many people pics, hardly any, but mainly nature. Also it has poor range for non-macro, making it so you have to put it two feet away to get a clear picture when not in macro mode.

It DID hit the bottom corner first, right near the battery pack. It *seems* cosmetic as well, though I wish there was some sort of rubber bumper that went around this to prevent this from happening.

It is strong enough to hold up to the abuse my 3 year old can throw at it. It gets shots of him doing things I wouldn't dare with a regular camera. I laid this on the water and let my son run to the camera splashing and got some cool shots.Quality of the images is to be expected from a point and shoot. Don't let the low light numbers fool you. This will not do what a SLR will do in low light. The small sensor suffers from the same shortcomings that all others do. If you want the best quality look at the Sony RX100 or equal camera if you are set on a point and shoot. Although artifacts are not too bad even cropped in, I just can't lie and say it is more than it is.There are a million settings in this thing and some of them are really really cool and helpful. Then there are some that I wonder why the heck they even added them. The HDR effect does 1 of 2 things. It either is way over the top or I can't notice it does anything at all. I wish they would have added a better way to bracket so I could do this myself if I wanted. You can bracket but it is very limited.I also wish there was a time lapse feature. In a camera like this it should be a must. Other weather proof cameras do it but sadly not here.There are also lenses you can add to it to either go longer or wider. But sadly you can not easily find the adapter you need to use them. There are ways but it really isn't worth the trouble.Overall I'm happy with the camera and it does 95 percent of what I'd ever want to do.

On rare occasion the lighting would be too \"flat\" because it evened it out a little too much but it was wonderful for correcting the light so you could see in your photo things that normally appear too dark when the light around it is too bright.

The TG-1 photos are crystal clear and beautiful, the other camera's shots can't even be used. Wish I could post the photos.The smaller f stop helped bring in a lot of extra light which is really helpful in underwater shooting.

The photo quality is really fantastic for an auto-only point and shoot. Low light pictures are quite good, with no grainy pictures. Underwater works great with bright clear pictures. Seals look very hardy and should last a long time. Battery life is ok, the only problem with it, is that it does not display battery unless you constantly press the menu button or change functions. When the low battery light starts to blink, it has maybe 30 seconds of charge left before it starts displaying charge battery. Kind of annoying that the battery indicator doesnt display all of the time and come on sooner. Dont really understand the point of GPS tagging your pictures, and runs the battery down twice as fast. Exterior is not very damage-proof for a 400 dollar TOUGH camera. Just plastic and after a few snorkel and kayak trips, the corners have some chips/paint scratches. Should have been aluminum case or at least edges. Have not tested dropping the camera but as far as underwater I have put it though its paces and it has not disappointed. Panarama should be a great feature for me, but auto panarama never lines up the 3 pictures correctly, and takes probably a full minute to process.

Just got back from a backpacking trip and the first chance to use my new camera.  The pictures of the high peaks, snow fields and glaciers, sky, lakes, and trees are very rich in color and quality and generally handled the challenges of over/under exposure of mountain conditions pretty well.The panorama leaves so very much to be desired though, and I have yet to take a series that the camera has stitched perfectly, or even very well for that matter.  The simple reason for this is the major amount of distortion that the three-picture format of the TG-1 creates.  More overlap generally minimizes distortion, but the TG's auto panorama mode has very little overlap and hence produces so much distortion that just about all the pictures I have taken have been a disappointment due to the poor quality stiching the software does.  A bummer having just come out of a stretch of the highest peaks in the Sierra Nevada mountains which should be the perfect setting for such a feature - the camera failed miserably in this category.  The 10 picture feature faired no better, as the software botches the stitching here too.  Unlike other software that came with cameras in the past, Olympus does not offer a manual feature to help supplement the failings of the auto-stitch.  Hopefully the next release will offer such a feature.If panorama is a must-have for you, look elswhere.

First I bought the latest offering of a compact waterproof from Nikon (their first attempt), but was disappointed in its low light performance.  Even my iPhone can take good pictures in bright daylight - I want something that works well at dawn, dusk, and indoors without a flash.Doing more research, I learned that Olympus had just released the TG-1, the first compact with a F2.0 lens for lowlight shooting.  Despite it only being on the market a few weeks, I took a risk and bought it.  I'm really glad I did.  Before returning the Nikon, I took some pictures of my daughter jumping around in low kitchen light with no flash.  The difference in the quality of the pictures is pronounced.  A bit of blur on the Olympus photos, very blurred photos on the other's.I haven't tried the camera underwater or accidentally dropped it yet, but I like the solid feel of the body.  The pictures it takes look great, and the various 'magic' functions are fun to experiment with.  The camera does a really nice job on panoramas by stitching three shots together.  The wide-angle lens has greater span than the 28-70 lens on my DSLR.  In fact,  one minor complaint about the camera is that wide angle is the default when the camera is turned on.  I try to remember to zoom in a bit before taking a picture, to avoid the wide angle curvature that can happen in the corners of some photos.  GPS is another feature that made me buy the camera, but it sucks the battery so fast I don't use it.  The camera can last about a day with heavy use without GPS.  I bought a spare from the Olympus website, and made it through a six day canoe trip with two batteries by not wasting battery looking at photos and no GPS.  Finally, force flash isn't allowed in Auto mode, so I have to use the Program mode and make sure everything else is set to auto.

I was looking for a rugged, waterproof (and sand-proof) camera after killing TWO older cameras directly and indirectly due to saltwater and sand.  So I bought the camera, and love it!  The low light handling and color capture are excellent.  I tested out the camera on a canyoneering trip (i.e., bouncing off rocks, water, and sand).  The camera survived and took awesome video and still photos.  I even (unintentionally) tested it with a five foot drop onto a rock.  Not even a scratch or a dent.One counter-comment:  There was a review commenting on auto focus during video not being perfect.  I only found this to be an issue if/when I zoomed in or out while filming, and it self-corrected in under a second.

It automatically takes a picture whenever a cat or dog's face is detected.

First, there is a ticking noise on all video recordings you cannot eliminate.  Apparently some consumers are lucky not to get such a defective camera but the net is booming with complaints about this issue and my TG1 with the ticking issue was sent back to Olympus with them responding back to me that it was normal.  Other consumers have similar experiences.  Second, service is very poor and non-responsive.  Third, it's ridiculous that you have to send the camera back to Olympus ($$$$) each year to redo the seals to maintain it as waterproof.  You will be better off buying a new camera or just getting a waterproof case where the seals can be maintained cost effectively or just taking your chances.  Fourth, the price is far too high considering these issues.  The camera should be recalled on the video defect.The good is that it takes very nice pictures and has some cool features.  If you dive or snorkel a lot you will need the waterproof case for longevity. That's another few hundred and defeats the purpose of this type of camera.  Also I understand this camera is actually manufactured in China.  This makes me wonder why but then U.S. outsources everything.  It took me 4 months before I got the accessory lens for this camera as their manufacturing process was behind and inventory was low due to very poor planning. To me this raises a big flag on the future viability of the Olympus company.  The company is  experiencing significant financial issues, accounting fraud, and bribery charges and has already paid substantial fines to regulatory authorities. In late 2011, the company fired its newly appointed British president, precipitating a scandal that wiped 75% off the company's stock market valuation. The scandal culminated in admission by the company that some of its board members had engaged in one of the biggest and most durable loss-concealing scams in the history of corporate Japan.Look for another choice until they get this camera at the right price and eliminate the ticking video defect.  If you are lucky enough to get one without the ticking defect than I would rate this camera 3.0 stars and at 4.0 stars if the price went below $250.  The reviews somehow missed these issues.

There is no RAW option so you are always shooting in JPEG.  Video is in MOV format but I had a problem opening the files in my preferred software.  It was easy to find many other apps that opened and edited the video files.  There are a LOT of special settings, like 3 snow settings, 3 underwater settings, and 4 macro settings.  I would have preferred an aperture priority and shutter speed priority setting for better control of depth of field.The body is robust and has a solid feel - a little heavy for a pocket.  The stereo microphone is in a position that can easily covered with a misplaced finger and I doubt the value of stereo that has pickups 1 inch apart.  The camera does a very good job handling colors and handles the flash as well as any on-camera flash (which is horrible) in low light and good as a fill light.Biggest hassle is the LED screen.

Smaller, lighter, tougher (by spec at least, I haven't dropped it or gone swimming with it yet), better looking pictures & videos, better stabalization and zoom (than the uzi!), excellent playback on my 1080p tv's, fantastic battery life...The only thing I miss from my past cameras is manual control and low light (ie, night time DARK) sensitivity.

Kojic", "ReviewID": "RB93XK43IIN6B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "In short, if you need a practical \"tough\" camera which produces images with vibrant colors, and don't care too much about the ultimate fidelity and image quality (sharpness particularly), this could be a good choice for you, but then you can get the same thing for less money. If you are used to excellent image quality, you should pass. There are much better compact cameras out there, get one and buy an under-water housing if you dive a lot.I must say I don't understand all the five-star reviews for this camera. I can understand that some people just want an underwater camera and they are happy to have one, but the reviews quoting good image quality are a total miss.I've had a range of compact cameras and DSLRs, so my impressions come from a solid reference sample. I do not compare this camera with my Nikon D300, nor with the D40 I used to have, and the Canon Rebel I used to play with, that would be unfair. I'm comparing it with some compact cameras I've had and still have, including the Canon PowerShot SD870IS, S90, and ELPH 300 HS, Panasonic FX-33 and Ricoh Caplio RX. This Olympus produces visibly less sharp images than my wife's 5 years old Canon PowerShot SD870IS, which in its day belonged to a lower market bracket. I say visibly less sharp, in plain view, I'm not talking magnifying and comparing at pixel level. If you do that, it becomes embarrassing how poorly TG-1 handles detail. At ISO 100 details are blurred like in an ISO 400 or ISO 800 image from the Canon. I went through two samples, because I really wanted this camera to be good, I liked it a lot for its advertised ruggedness (I destroyed my Canon S90 by taking it to a boat trip; it didn't like all the sea water splashing it for hours). I also still have the film-era Olympus Stylus, which is a great little camera, so I wanted to believe this can be its successor. However, both samples of TG-1 produced the same image quality, so I guess it's by design. I should say that I played with all the available options, trying to keep as much manual setting as possible (not too much is available, though), but there was not much difference. Images otherwise look good on camera's own LCD, deceivingly good. I normally view them on a 24\" calibrated IPS display.Otherwise it's a well-designed camera, with just a couple of glitches. For one, the menu options could be a bit better organised, but there are two useful Custom settings, so that's not a big deal. The major one is that the lens is not protected in any way. It actually is protected by a plexi element in front of it, but that plexi element is not protected in any way, and it is not user-replaceable either. That is a strange design choice for a tough camera that shouldn't be afraid of being bumped around. The only solution is to buy the CLA-T01 conversion lens adapter, which comes with a lens cap. This should have been built in by design.If you have the camera, you may have learned not to use the IS in video mode, it produces an unbelievable amount of rolling shutter effect. You also must have noticed that the camera goes out of focus if you zoom during video shoot, and only hunts it back after a couple of seconds. The panorama mode is useless in comparison with Sony's sweep panorama on an Xperia phone I have.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "a great adventure camera", "Author": "Carryit \"Not much to say\"", "ReviewID": "ROHNE1T6MSXRT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this camera works as advertised... i use it in the pool taking photos and videos of grandkids... i can carry it on my bicycle and i use it to mark where i have been with the gps... i have deducted a star because i found the controls difficult to physically manipulate... you may not have that problem but i have to base the review on my experience...", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Rugged enough", "Author": "Proshopper", "ReviewID": "R22HWH92RKY39N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have owned the panasonic ts2, ts3, and ts4.
