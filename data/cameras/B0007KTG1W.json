With this camera I was up and running in 5 seconds.(great quality photos) At 6.3 megapixel you get photos of amazing quality with extreme detail (sometimes too extreme; skin imperfections are not great at up close)(pre-programmed modes) Basically the pre-programmed mode allows you to set basic camera features (such as shutter speed and flash) all at once with a click of a button. You also get 1 mode to program yourself. This allows you to go from a portrait mode to action mode in a second rather than having to play around with all of the settings 1x1.More on the cons:(slow at the start) From \"Off\" mode to picture mode takes longer then you would expect (especially if you have to use flash). So if you want to take a picture of something quickly, you maybe very disappointed. For me this is not such a huge problem since I pretty much take portrait or landscape photos.(slow to charge flash) I think this is a much bigger problem for this camera than the previous one I mentioned. It takes a while (think like 10 secs or so) between each flash shot. Personally I think this is the biggest flaw that this camera has. This is most annoying when you are taking pictures in a dark environment and the first one you took is not so great so you want to take another quicky, well you're going to have to wait.Overall:I am extremely happy with this camera. For the $ you are paying for it, you are getting a great little camera. And yes it is actually smaller than my last camera (Cannon Elph 2.3 megapixel).", "Date": "July 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great camera, minor flaws", "Author": "N.

If you really want a quick shot, and point and shoot it, even though the subject is right in front of your camera it is too quick to take the snap and your subject could be out of focus.The last one is a killer for me, and I'm surprised others haven't mentioned this.", "Date": "December 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "A great family camera", "Author": "Steven K.

I wanted a camera with a better battery and higher than 3.1 MP, but I loved the HP menus, quality of pics, and general ease of use.  So I chose the R717 and I just wanted to write and say I love the camera, it works great especially for someone who is not an expert with cameras and just wants one to take good pics with.  The review that says Circuit City gives you a free dock is not accurate, they do NOT give you a free dock, it is an error on their webpage and they do not honor errors!

The lens is excellent and the zoom and close-up features work very well.  The body is nicely designed, fits the hand well, and is very sturdy.  I and another family member have taken a number of postcard-quality outdoor photos with it.  The higher-quality image functions and some fo the other digital features, as well as learning to \"tweak\" the printing, add to the serious-photography potential.I took the HP introductory digital photography course, and highly recommend it.  It, along with a lot of picture-taking, helped me understand both the potential and the limitations of the R717.The limitations, from my perspective, are as follows:1.  The flash lights up the foreground too much, making indoor shots look artificial and washed-out.  I haven't yet had the chance to use the \"adaptive lighting\" function, which may help this problem.2.  It doesn't do well in low-light situations where movement is involved, although with more experience I have found that it will take excellent indoor still photos (portraits, for example) using available light.3.  With quite a bit of practice I have found that it will take spectacular sunset photos, although the colors aren't quite true-to-life - the software adds too much yellow, and the prints sometimes have a \"paint-by-numbers\" quality.4.  The view-finder is a bit off and I don't used it very much, instead rely on the \"live-view\" function.  It is sometimes difficult to see the screen, so there is a bit of guess-work involved in certain outdoor conditions.I don't see the need for a docking station, at least for my uses.  Downloading and e-mailing photos is pretty user-friendly with the camera just as it is.  A bigger memory card, a spare battery and charger, and a portable hard drive for storage would be more useful accessories than a dock, in my opinion.  I store my photos on RW CD's.  A quirk of the HP Image Zone software is that it won't record your photos to CD, so I just use the \"My pictures\" program on MS XP, which works just fine.  I think the Adobe Photoshop Starter Edition, version 3.0 (free), will also do that.I have had very good experience with HP customer service, once I got used to the Indian accents.  And HP's online courses are very helpful.For the price this is a great little camera.  Its drawbacks have only one remedy:  Money.  More money will get you a better camera, but I don't think you will get a better camera than this for less money.", "Date": "January 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "This camera gets an A+", "Author": "R. J.

It's just the right size, the video quality is very good, it came with a free memory card... And it looks great!The only way to make this camera would be to make the LCD display bigger and give it a longer battery life - but then those are two things that I'd like to have in unlimited quantities (i.e. I'm never going to be *satisfied* with whatever's on a real camera), and both the screen size and battery life in this camera are actually fine.Above was my original review. Now for the bad stuff. After 2 years of medium use, the battery became a joke. It would charge up fully only to say quarter full after being disconnected.  At one point the camera didnt come on at all so had to do a hard reset. Then there was the image issue. Faint horizontal lines ruining the picture.

I opened the box, and without even reading the instructions, I put in the battery and the 512MB sd card I had purchased and I was ready to go!  The control buttons are a nice size, not too tiny and very easy to figure out.  That's really szying alot too, because some cameras are so complex to master that you miss alot of great shots -- that won't happen here.  The HP Image Zone software is easy to understand and makes it simple to edit the photos on the computer.  My dog is black, and that's a really difficult color to photograph well, so I started using the sport mode which has a really fast shutter speed.  The macro mode is terrific too.  After checking out a bunch of different brands at the store, I settled on this Photosmart R717 and I'm thrilled.  The only thing you might want to check for yourself is if it's a good fit for your hands.  If you have very small hands or if this is for a youngster, I would suggest visiting a store and handling it for yourself -- it's definitely not tiny or cheap feeling.  Also, with the optical zoom, the lense does stick out about 1\" when the camera is on, but I quickly got used to that and it's been smooth sailing.", "Date": "December 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best point-and-shoot I've owned", "Author": "C.

I had had an HP before, so I thought I'd try this one.  My other cameras date stamps were so big and ugly that I gave them away, not a cheap couple of cameras either.  This camera's date stamp is very small and white in color, so it doesn't take away from the photo like the big green colored stamps did or the big white stamp did that didn't even develope completely on the picture.  I'm old, need dates to remember when I took the picture.I was surprised, too, by the quality of the pictures.  Even in dark restaurants, the pictures were clear and colors vivid. I didn't expect such good pictures for the price of the camera.  My friends are impressed.  The battery is great,too, not the regular two AA batteries, being able to re-charge inside the camera itself.  I bought the dock, too, so I have two charged batteries all the time.  I thought I would need the extra battery because the other cameras I've had ate batteries.  I have never had to use the second battery, and I've taken a lot of pictures at one time, like maybe even 100 or more.  The warm up time is slow, as with the processing time between flashes, but those failing points are miniscule compared to all the other good qualities.  I didn't have to read the entire manuel before I got started.  The menu is simple and easy to understand as it is explained by the menu within the camera itself.  This is a great little camera.  The dock is great, too.  When I finish taking pictures, I just plug the camera into the dock, and I am ready to go the next time with two fully charged batteries.  Once, I forgot to plug in the camera and I wanted to take a picture of my dog \"in the moment.\"  I just plugged in the camera and took the pictures on house current with the dead battery in the camera charging.

Since it was under warranty, I sent it back to the manufacturer and got this camera instead - the R717. They gave me a free upgrade.First of all this is a thick camera. It's not one of those super slim ones. You can still fit it in your pocket but you will feel it more. Second it's a family point and shoot. It's not going to take rapid pictures or have quick flashes and like.OK, but here's the important part. It takes REALLY sharp pictures! Currently, I have been using a Nikon CoolPix. You would expect a Nikon 8MP camera to take sharp pictures. Maybe if I put it on a tripod it would (haven't tried it). I just feel the Nikon's pictures are not that sharp, like they are sometimes out of focus. It can be acceptable, but not like this HP R717. This HP camera takes really sharp pictures. That's what I like about it.The HP R717 main draw for me is that the pictures look awesome. 6 MP is more than enough for viewing on screen and for printing 4x6 pictures (probably could do 8x10 easily). It's thick, it may be slow, and the video is very grainy, but if you want SHARP pictures, I found this camera to have that.Unfortunately, my R717 was in my pocket and crushed when I fell off my scooter so the screen is malfunctioning and the camera a bit scratched up... but it still works and takes sharp pictures!

This is good for still pictures and daytime pictures but not for night or when your at an event where you would want to take a quick succession of pictures.Quality:  6.2 Megapixiles used to be a lot, and if you print out the pictures on photo-paper it is.  Computers these days can display more than that and investing in a camera with more megapixles will get you better clarity/quality photos.Ease of use:  well the button that takes the picture is in the same spot as every other camera so its not that hard to start clicking out of the box.  If you want to change settings that is fairly easy keeping in mind that all the changes you make will be erased and default settings take effect after you turn the camera on and off.  It has a few different settings depending on where you are (snow, beach, action, etc...) which make light changes but none that will actually help much.Bottom line:  For me this was reliable, still works after years of having one but the technology is out dated and the camera isn't that great.

I really liked it and thought it was great.  However, 12 months later, the camera bought the farm.  I had a huge event coming up at this time and wanted a camera very quick that I knew how to use, so, stupid me, ordered the same camera, thinking the 1 year lifespan had to have been a fluke.  Guess what?  My 2nd HP R717 lasted for 13 months before it died ! Mind, I was not spilling soda on it or dropping the things either...too bad I can't get my money back - over $400 spent on these things.

This camera is 6.2 mp with 6.4 mp capacity. Its zoom capabilities are unbelievable.  The HP Image Advice and in-camera red-eye removal give you all the editing power you need on the camera!!!!  It has a very good battery life and lasts for about 8 hours.

I was informed it would cost around $200.00 dollars to receive most likely a refurbished replacement camera, with only a 3-month warranty.After trying the replacement camera for 15 days I was then to send my old camera back as partial payment for the replacement camera.I told HP no thanks, because they had already gotten enough money from me.", "Date": "December 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "R717 Camera a Replacement for R707", "Author": "Ralph E.

The On/Off switch broke on the R707 and that left me with a lot of useless accessories.  It was cheaper to purchase the R717 at Amazon than to have HP repair the R707.  The pictures have been good so far, however I keep looking for the On/Off switch to break on this camera.
