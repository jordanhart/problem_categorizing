That being said, this camera was a pain to set up. After setting everything up and getting to the point where it should be working, it didn't. I then spent another 2 hours on the phone with TRENDnet's tech support, only to have them tell me that the camera is not compatible with Internet Explorer 8, and I needed to use a computer that had Internet Explorer 7. It also does not support full motion video when using Firefox, only 1 still picture per second (what's the point?), and will not work with Safari. Needless to say I returned the camera to Amazon for a refund and got a Sharx Security VIPcella-IR SCNC2607 wireless network camera (also from Amazon) and had it up and running within 10 minutes of taking it out of the box. It's a little pricier, but the time saved setting it up, and the video quality (which was much better than I expected) makes it totally worth it!", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "broken item", "Author": "Henry Alfau Rivas \"hbalfau\"", "ReviewID": "R1S5MEU2TLAB3D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the camera arrived broken, and according to the type of damage appears to have been released so by the supplier, so I want the prompt repayment of money paid for the cameras.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000IXQPEE"}}
