{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Comparison to Canon Powershot S40", "Author": "netscorer", "ReviewID": "R3OGOPMVOFX088", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1) Size. Both cameras are small but the crown goes to Olympus, even if only by few cubic points. Olympus is also lighter of the two.2) Resolution. Both cameras feature 4.1Mpixel CCD. What Canon misses and Olympus has is an extrapolation to 3,200 X 2,400 (or 7+Mpixels). By making an extrapolation from a raw image (not even TIFF!) the camera may make a much smarter decision then your average Photoshop program. This is the must if you want to print a poster from your picture.3) Picture quality. Very good and comparable between both cameras. Even the most advanced reviewers have a hard time giving clear advantage to one or the other. Canon has a slightly better rendering algorithm, so the nod goes to Powershot but not by much. ...4) Lenses - for all purposes the same. Not as fast as on any of the bigger cameras but satisfying for most applications.5) Zoom - same.6) Storage media. Olympus uses SmartMedia, while Canon uses CompactFlash (types I and II). Both supply laughable 16Mb out of the box, so you have to purchase larger modules. The prices for memory are comparable but advantage goes to Canon, since Compact Flash is a more advanced format and comes in bigger sizes. Still, 128Mb is more then enough for a day of shooting.7) Batteries. Both cameras are not ideal. Canon pretty much forces you to buy additional module ... since it uses a proprietary format, but Olympus does not supply a rechargeable batteries and does not allow to recharge in camera, so you need to buy NiMh AA batteries and charger, which would cost the same (smart investment). Still I would give an advantage to Olympus because you can always find AA batteries in any store if you ran out of power. I also want to address here the power consumption since a lot of users are giving their thumbs down based on this feature alone. Both cameras are bad. This is a sad reality if you want a subcompact camera. But not make a tragedy out of this. If you use both cameras smartly, it should last you the whole day of shooting quite easily.8) Price. Still too high IMHO for both of cameras. Canon is slightly more expensive but not by much. You can buy any camera now for less [money]. With all accessories (memory, batteries, case, etc.) you should just be able to fit in ... budget.9) Flash. Mediocre at best for both cameras. Canon does a slightly better job at red-eye reduction, but Olympus is slightly better with white-balance adjustment. Still this is probably the weakest point for both cameras.10) Video. Both cameras have built-in video mode with sound recording and speaker for later review. Since I don't care much for this feature I won't discuss it here.11) Supplied software. Olympus ships with camera the Adobe Photoshop Elements - by far the best photo-editing package on the market now.12) Nice extras. Canon comes in a metal casing which gives it a very sophisticated and ruggish look. Olympus casing is more stylish IMHO and is made of very sturdy plastic. Both cameras have auto USB connectivity and optional waterproof cases. Olympus has three unique features that made me buy it. First is a low-light noise reduction that can be activated when you switch camera into night shot option. The special algorithm that Olympus uses allows it to compensate for long-exposure related errors (such as \"hot\" pixels) and results in a much better looking pictures. If you like to make night photos (I do) you can't live without this feature. Second feature is pixel mapping that allows camera to compensate for dead pixels in CCD. Until you have this problem you won't probably think much about it. The third feature is \"User Mode\" which allows you to store your preferable settings and access them by simple switch of the dial. I use it quite often and it saves a lot of preparation time before shot is taken and results in a better quality picture. It is especially useful if you take a series of pictures in challenging lighting conditions (such as twilight time).Overall, I chose Olympus for the above mentioned features, but you can't go wrong with any of these little cameras.", "Date": "April 15, 2002"}, {"Title": "Finally.. a high resolution pocket size digital camera!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2HJD1Q7IACOHS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used Olympus point-and-shoot cameras for years, starting with the XA.  Though my 'main' camera is a Nikon F3, over the years I've opted to carry the small Olympuses for travel. If it can't fit in my pocket or purse, it doesn't go!Finally... there is a pocket-sized digital camera that rivals the resolution of a film:  the Olympus D40Z. It has more bells and whistles than the average photographer will ever need, but it also runs just fine in the 'PHD' AUTO mode. And the quality is fantastic! Another feature I really liked was the drag-and-drop feature that allows you to offload pics direct to a PC hard drive through the USB port makes download a snap.  On a short boat ferry, I powered up my laptop and had the pics downloaded in less than 30 seconds. (One friend uses his Olympus to transfer files from one PC to another at home!)Battery life has not been a problem - I've run several hundred photos through the camera and am still on the original battery. I don't however use the viewer much - I save battery life by downloading photos to the PC rather than viewing and editing them in the camera. Nevertheless, purchasing the rechargeable batteries is recommended in the long run.I was looking at the Nikon CoolPix 990 and 995 before this camera was released. Though the quality and durability is very good, I was put off by the larger body size and weight of the Nikon (if it's not small, it will probably be left in the drawer more often than not). So if you're in the market for a digital camera and need small size, high picture quality with enough features 'headroom' to allow a high degree of control over the image, you should definitely consider the Olympus D40Z.", "Date": "December 30, 2001"}, {"Title": "Tiny camera, many features", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3514NEGW9902Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the second Olympus camera I've owned, and I bought it specifically for travel. It fits easily in a jacket pocket (or shirt pocket without the case) or a briefcase, so there's no excuse to leave it behind. Like all Olympus digital cameras, the D40 optics are excellent, and the resulting pictures have good color fidelity and saturation. The extra pixels also make a big difference in enlargements. 8x10 prints from the D40 are noticeably better than the 8x10s from my two-year old, 1.3 megapixel D620.  Even subtle scenes like sunsets are captured with excellent fidelity - almost as good as film. The camera has a dial that lets you select from several pre-programmed modes for scenes like landscapes, portraits, etc. One really cool pre-programmed mode is a night setting that allows long exposures by cancelling the noise that normally builds up in digital pictures. Of course, there is also an \"auto\" mode for us lazy folks, but if you're ambitious, you can navigate the menus, set everything manually, and save it as a user-defined, custom mode. It also shoots QuickTime/MPEG movies (with sound).While I like the portability, the camera does have a few drawbacks. It uses a LOT of battery power, so the two AA cells run down very fast. Olympus ships the camera with a disposable 3V lithium battery, but get this, it costs about $10 to replace! I use rechargeable NiMh AA cells, and while they only last 1/3 as long as the throw-away lithium battery, over time they will save $$$. Be sure to get the newer 1600 or 1800 ma-hr AA cells, and pack four of them in the camera case.Another potential drawback is the complexity of this camera. I enjoy learning how to operate stuff like this, but if you are intimidated by options and menus, you might want to look at a different model.", "Date": "December 10, 2001"}, {"Title": "Yippie", "Author": "Hugh Barrett Flynn", "ReviewID": "RJW9RXF7V6MJ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 4th Digital Camera. I love photography and know how to take great pictures. Olympus has done it again.  The D-40 is an amazing product. First remember you are buying a point and shoot camera. This camera is tiny and light.  When you put it in your pocket you will not know it is there. The sliding lens cover is great because you can put the camera anywhere with no lens cap to worry about.  It is simple... It is complex.  This is a real plus.  Most of the functions are very simple.  But if you are anal, then you can do whatever you want to create interesting photographs.  They included a dial that allows you to select the type of picture you want.  This is good. However, you need to have your brain alerted to the dial because it is easily moved. They have a view mode when you are taking pictures making it easy to view the picture you took and return quickly to shooting.  When I first picked up the camera it was hard to hold because I have big hands.  Then I noticed the grooves in the camera that allowed my hands to naturally hold the unit.  It stuck like glue to my hands. The zoom is not great but if you have legs you can overcome that problem.The picture quality is amazing.  Colors are extremely accurate and the intensity of the pictures are hard to believe.  You actually get excited when you look at your work. Each picture is a little less than 1 meg.Now I could go on because there is tons more to say... But the reality is, if you like taking pictures of everything, and you want the easiest, smallest way to do that, this is the camera... no questions asked... it is so cool... thank you, thank you, Olympus for giving us this amazing piece of technology.And when you buy this camera, Olympus has great service.

We live in Bermuda so we take lots of outside pictures - beach scenes, foliage, macro shots of exotic flowers etc.  The colours on the photos are clear and rich, and our pictures cannot be distinguished from real film shots. We print on an HP960c printer and use Kodak photo printer paper.  The results are remarkable.For indoor shots the subject needs to be close - typically with digital cameras the flash could do to be a little stronger.When I first started with the camera, the lag between depressing the shutter button and taking the photo was a bit perplexing.  However, I understand this typical of digital cameras (but not a problem on my previous Toshiba digital).  BUT - I learned to set a manual focal distance to take quick shots. Also the burst function which takes several shots in rapid succession helped alot.We purchased a rechargable battery kit with 1700 model batteries.Using the optical viewfinder and occasionally using the LCD to alter commands, I have been able to shoot and download 180 pictures at high quality level.  Since the camera takes only 2 batteries, it's easy to keep two spare charged batteries in the case.  I did go through the original lithium battery very fast because when I first got the camera I tried out every function, including shootin several movies and used the LCD alot.  Re-chargeables are definately the answer.I recommend to get the camera case designed for the camera - it is compact and has a special compartment for the spare batteries. Also a 128 mb Smart Media Card - it will hold 130 pictures at High Quality.All in all, we are thrilled.  We had also considered the later model Canon cameras but read reviews about poor autofocus. I have had yet to have an out of focus picture on this camera!  The manual could be a bit more explicit, but Olympus on-line is very helpful. Next time however, I would like a larger optical zoom.We use Windows XP and everything works fine with it.

Very compact--fits easily in the pocket or a small purse when going out. If the camera is too big to carry around with you, it's worthless--you won't get any pictures if you don't bring the camera2. High resolution--4 megapixels is enough to make a high quality 8 by 10 print. Unless you're a professional photographer, it has all the resolution you need.3. Takes AA batteries--this was key, as the Olympus was the only ultracompact that takes AA's rather than proprietary batteries. The lefetime is a little less but if you buy a set of 4 NiMH batteries you can always have a spare pair handy. Other cameras' proprietary batteries will cost another $50-75 over the base price, if you want a spare. And since it uses AA's you can always buy more if you don't have spare rechargables handy, or if you forget to bring the charger on vacation.4. Optical zoom. Digital zoom is a meaningless number--it's the same thing you can do with photoshop after the fact. Only true optical zoom gives you zoom while keeping the resolution, and the D40 has it.I was looking for all those features, and the D40 was the only digital that provided them. We took it on our 3 week honeymoon and the pics turned out great. A pair of NiMH's last about a day of fairly frequent shooting.All in all, I'd highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "October 22, 2002"}, {"Title": "This camera kicks butt!", "Author": "Newbie digicamer", "ReviewID": "R2RLIJV1G95X2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After much shopping around on the internet, and reading reviews I decided on the Olympus D-40.  It's my first digital camera and so far I'm VERY pleased.  Its compact size makes it easy to take with you.  The biggest selling points were (1) the 4 megapixel capability, (2) the size AND (3) it has a remote!  I love this feature, it means I can take pictures of myself with my family/friends without having to do the run back and forth routine that you do with a timer. (It does have a timer for those that still want that option)  The remote works for a few feet - enough to get a pic of you with that awesome scenery, monument, etc. behind you.  Also, you can manually set all settings - shutter speed, etc.The drawbacks are (1) the zoom and (2) the lag time between the press of the shutter button and the actual picture being taken.  The zoom doesn't go as far as I wanted.  I would have also liked the capability to put an extra zoom lens on.  Sometimes the lag between pressing the button and the photo being taken is enough to miss the shot.  For those reasons I've given the camera 4 stars instead of 5.  Overall, this camera has been a great starter for me and I bet would be good for a repeat digital camera buyer who wants a bunch of features in a small package.P.S.

Simply you cannot tell the difference from a hi-quality film camera.2: If you like the quick \"point and shoot\" photography without tripods and professional settings, the camera is amazing and the zoom is just what you need. It takes clear and sharp pictures. The camera of course has noumerous settings and capabillities but it works fine in auto mode. Just turn it on and shoot.3: The camera is the smallest by far in 4 megapixels. You can have it always with you, everywhere, even in your shirt pocket.4: Real plug and play. Just plug it into a USB port and that's it. No drivers no CDs...Just drag and drop like a hard drive. With the 128 MB SM card you can cary more files than a 100 MB zip drive. Yes I use it to copy and transfer files.5:It gives you for an extra the pixel-maching technology.

The camera takes excellent, clear, vivid pictures and is very small (not as tiny as the Canon digital Elph line, but the small Canons are currently only at 2.1 MP). Although you don't have to be a genius to figure the camera out, ease of use is not the camera's strong point. Icons and menu labels don't make immediate sense; you must read the manual (PDF format on the CD -- no print version!) to understand what the menus and dial-mode positions do. Though the controls are complex, they're also deep and feature-rich. The camera gives an Auto mode, a Program mode, Shutter priority, Aperature priority, and full Manual modes, and automatic scenery, portrait, and people-in-front-of-scenery modes. Macro mode and night-time mode are also on the dial for quick access.Olympus includes an infrared remote control in the package (nice not to have to go buy one separately). The 30-second movie mode works fine, but don't think of it as a substitute for a camcorder--the microphone doesn't work that well. It is a mystery to me why Olympus chose to use a proprietary battery size. The included NON-rechargeable lithium battery is about the same size as two AA batteries, and you can use two AA batteries in place of Olympus-brand lithium batteries... Ni-MH rechargeable AA batteries are the cheapest solution in the long-run; the camera chews up Alkaline batteries like crazy, and lithium AA batteries are about as expensive as the Olympus-brand battery, per picture. Note: you can't recharge your Ni-MH AA batteries inside the camera; you must have a separate charger. Silliness. But not so silly that I wouldn't recommend the camera. I'm happy I bought it.Last item: I use Windows XP Home, and I tried hooking up the camera to my computer via the included USB cable.

I had a chance to use this one for a couple of days and while I certainly liked it, I don't miss not having it.My complaint focuses primarily on its balance of features; it is rather expensive, and a good part of that expense is due to its outstanding 4 megapixel resolution. (\"resolution\" describes the number of digital dots that make up the image; as you enlarge a picture, the dots begin to pull apart and the picture begins to look grainy). For Internet purposes (either emailing pics to family members or for posting pics on websites), about 1 megapixel is fine. For printing standard 4\" x 6\" photos, 1 megapixel is also adequate. The 2+ megapixel cameras (that's a big group) do a fine job with enlargements of 5\" x 7\"; the 3+ megapixel cameras easily handle 8\" x 10\". While this latter group can produce pretty good 11\" x 14\" enlargements, it is at this level that a 4 megapixel camera begins to make sense. But how often will you take a pic you want to enlarge to that size? Pictures taken at higher resolution slow down the camera (\"write time\"), increase battery use, take up much more space on memory cards and on your PC, and email or open on websites more slowly.For my purposes, a powerful zoom lens with good glass optics will always trump resolution. To be sure, other features do matter: size, balance, battery setup, connectivity and the ability to shoot QuickTime movies. Having said all that, I would much prefer to grab the Canon S300 or the Camedia 700 than the D-40, but if someone just gave you a D-40 for the holidays, you still did pretty well.

I got 468 terrific photos ,almost never ran down the batteries in a days shooting and found the carrying case saved my camera from a rain storm(my underwear got soaked in the rain).  When I got home I plugged the camera into my Windows xp computer and did a copy and paste from the camera to the computer  hard drive. The photos were amazingly beautiful and accurate in both bright light and at nite.  So whats is wrong with the camera.  Perhaps the battery situation could be improved as to  battery life, the camera might be better in a metal case and  .5 inch longer, the slight time delay in shooting could be shortened.But realistically this camera is fantastic and fits in you shirt pocket.

Here are my thoughts:1) The D40 takes pictures better than a 35mm because: a) with digital you can instantly see the pictures and take more if needed, b)you tend to take a lot more pictures resulting in a better chance of excellent photos (and you delete the useless ones), c)the small display -- if you shoot with this -- causes you to take lots more closeups than you would with a 35mm and the result is better because of this, d) the print quality on photographic paper is on par with a 35mm (I do notice the \"hot pixels\" sometimes only because I read these reviews, e) I really have not used much of the digital editing using the software -- this would be an extra edge over regular cameras.2) The minimovie mode takes reasonable movies -- better than the reviews would have you think. I have some keepers. Although I have not got the audio to work right.  And the Quicktime format means that if you burn CD's with the movies to send to others you need to also send them the QuickTime program if they don't have high speed internet.3)Why I deducted a star in my rating: no redeye reduction.  I think most digitals don't have this -- why not?  It means that you get lots of redeye shots.  The software takes out most but not all of the redeye and is inconsistent, and its an extra labour that we should not have to do.4) As you do not look down the lense as with my IS-3000 the viewfinder is not so good -- I think a common drawback of digitals. You don't really get what you see.  This is an area where my IS-3000 is superior: framing shots.  I recommend using the LCD to frame shots.  It is more accurate although on bright days it is difficult to see.5) Installation.  I could not get the software to work with 98ME after visits to the website and calls to customer service.  I then upgraded to XP and it worked like a charm.6) I agree with commenters that the owner's guide is not so clear.  It is true that the camera is intuitive on all the basic features and more.  However, there are some features I would like more explanation about.  Shame on you Olympus!  You could put details on the web if you don't want to put them in the owner's guide.7) This camera, probably like all digitals, is a bit slow to fire up compared to a regular camera.  It takes a few seconds to turn on, then two seconds to fire up the LCD.  Also, like all digitals, there is about a second delay between when you press the button and when it takes a shot.8) Zoom is limited.  I may have considered buying extra zoom if available.  9) I was expecting the camera to be a battery eater and it is.

The automatic setting works pretty well.  It supports ISO-400 and has less noise than many newer cameras.  It also takes decent flash photos.  And it does have modest optical zoom.  The settings are pretty easy to use and it gives you a good amount of flexibility, although the full manual mode is clumsy.  It is very small, and it is very durable--I have used mine for four years, and the plastic cover for the ports broke off, and the icons wore off the dial, but it still works like a charm.  The night-setting also takes fabulous long-exposure pictures.The weak points are pretty self-evident.  The viewscreen is tiny, the camera has a very slow startup time, and flash cycling is pretty slow.  And the digital zoom is pretty much useless; modern photo programs can interpolate at least as well.I think this would be an excellent purchase for those wanting a low-end digital camera.  It simply blows away modern models in the below-$100 price range.  I now have a Canon PowerShot A700 (about $300) and I can say with confidence that this old Olympus still wins out over my new camera in some situations.

Maybe part of it is that we've been using higher resolution, more fully-featured digtal cameras and have been unwilling to accept the compromises of their smaller siblings.  But finally, I've found the camera for us - small enough to stay in my wife's purse or clipped to my climbing harness, yet flexible and high quality enough to not make us cringe when the images are printed.The D-40 shares the strengths common to Olympus cameras: excellent optics, flexibility of operation, high quality of manufacture and excellent image quality.  Unfortunately, the major problems common to older Olympus digital cameras are still existant: mediocre software, a non-rechargable battery and a tiny media card.  The D-40 lens is excellent for a camera of this size and price, resulting in superior image sharpness, even at the wide angle limit where most consumer digital cameras suffer.  It's zoom range is equivalent to 35 to 98mm on a 35mm camera and the aperture is f 2.8.  The camera weighs under 7 ounces and it is tiny, easily fitting in a shirt pocket.  Standard AA batteries will work with the D-40 if the standard lithium battery dies and you can't find them locally.  I'm psyched up that we'll be carrying a camera with us to more places.

The D40 suited up perfect. Yes, 4MP may not seem much compared to what's out there now - but I figured, when am I ever going to print anything larger than 8x10 anyway? 4 MP was perfect for me, more would be a waste.As i said, the features are all there. Choose your own shutter speeds and apetures, white balance, video (yes, the vid sux, but that's true of most cameras. Same as digital video cameras take sucky stills. Give it a few more years you might be able to get a really good true hybrid. But i'm not waiting that long.) The only feature I can think of that I've really missed was no hotshoe for a bounce flash. It does have a tripod mount.It's also a great point and shooter, with several pre-sets. So you can use those and if you decide you want to be brave and try out other stuff, that's there too.It takes AAs, which if you get rechargeables and if you don't use the LCD screen can go for quite some time. I was once old school photography, so the viewfinder feels better to me anyway.The one major flaw I heard of before buying was that if you shoot an extremely high contrast shot you might get some violet bleed. In the few years I've had this camera, I've yet to actually see that happen. And even if it does - it's easily corrected in photoshop.My last thing to point out is it IS dated. The memory cards it uses are a thing of the past that you will mostly likely have to hunt for or buy online. I bought myself 4 cards, which will last me several hundred pics, which is more than I exspect to ever have to shot at one time.Oh, another thing I really liked - it's size was perfect for me. The tiny ones always seemed to flimsy and it gets hard to hold the camera right if it's too light or heavy. This is not a wallet or slim shirt pocket camera. But it will fit in a pocket or purse quite nicely.Overall, for the price, it is an excellent little camera.
