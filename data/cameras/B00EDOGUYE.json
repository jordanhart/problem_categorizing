The first day, I took it to the beach when we were splashing around in the waves, and it was just fine.  I took several pictures outside of the water that were just fine as well.  I recharged the battery (using the charge port in the battery compartment, as the camera does not come with a separate battery charger.  I sealed up the compartment.The next day, I took it snorkeling.  The first time in the water (at the surface, so no diving involved), it worked fine.  I did have some difficulties seeing the display, as the sun was shining through the water and I was not able to tell if the camera was on.  I hoped for the best, and took pictures anyway.  I was trying to turn the camera on and off while in the water, as I wasn't certain it was on.  When I changed directions, I  was able to see the view screen, and it was operational.  When I got out of the water, I turned the camera off.  I went to turn it on again to take more pictures and the camera wouldn't boot up.  Shortly thereafter, the view screen fogged up, and when the power button was depressed, water 'squelched' out.  I knew the camera was toast.Fortunately, the pictures that I took seem to be fine on the card.  I removed it from the camera as soon as I got to shore so it wouldn't corrode.  The battery and the camera are done.  Hopefully the warranty will cover this.  I also purchased an additional warranty, so maybe I'll be able to recoup some of my losses.", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Was not told it was used", "Author": "Dawn Lewis", "ReviewID": "R20KSPFRQOD42Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera works great. I was able to take great pics with it and excited to use it more on my adventures. The only complaint I have is that it was used and this was not advertised in the description. There were pictures already on it when I got it. Wouldn't have bought it at the price if I knew because I could have gotten a new one for $10 more.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "everything you need for portable photos", "Author": "T Palmer", "ReviewID": "R1LNKDC43SOX3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This thing is awesome, excellent picture quality, easy to use interface menus and durable for every day use.
