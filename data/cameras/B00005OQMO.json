{"Reviews": [{"Title": "No Nonsense Digital Camera", "Author": "Carole Roberts", "ReviewID": "R3PMPLYA2WISHY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before purchasing the Fuji 2600, I experienced a number of other digital cameras, some costing much more.  Although many of them had more features, none were as reliable.  I finally gave up on the expesive cameras since the extra features (that require the use of the LCD display) are worthless in sunlight anyway.  This is a gadget free camera that takes excellent pictures. I've never missed a shot even when the subjects are in motion.  The fast auto-focus and lack of gadgets makes this camera seemingly foolproof.Sharp, bright and true color (No sign of color aberations, blooming or color saturation) - Quiet fast zoom lense - Downloading pictures is simple and fast - Batteries last longer than any other digital I tried - Camera comes as a complete package (includes rechargeable batteries, compact charger and a reasonable size memory card) - Camera is small & easy to carry (the future of digital cameras) - The F3.8 lens is a bit slow for low light conditions but adequate for most shots and perfect for a camera of this calibre - The optical view finder shows only 80% size of final photo (Most cameras seem to do this and I don't understand why, however, you do learn to compensate).I've had my camera for about 2 weeks.  Already 2 of my friends have purchased the same camera after seeing it.  It's a reliable camera at a great price.  I highly recommend it.", "Date": "November 15, 2001"}, {"Title": "You will love it !", "Author": "superman2k3 \"superman2k3\"", "ReviewID": "RZNK37ZBOFW1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very good camera for its price range and features including true 3X optical zoom lens which retracts very neatly when you shut the camera off. The two step camera shut off (which amazom review sees as a weak point) is actually very useful for viewing pics and keeps the lens shut. So you can see pics in bad weather without worring about your lens.The digital zoom doesn't work with the 2 megapixel resolution, it only works with 1 megapixel or VGA mode. However the digital zoom could be done later on the computer also, so no big problems.The battery charger included is supposed to recharge a fully discharged battery in 5 hrs. The manual refer to any fuji charger for times under 2 hrs.The kit includes excellent accessories: 2 AA 1700mAh NiMH rechargable batteries, recharger (works from 110-240 V), 16MB smartmedia card with cover/label, a hand strap (handy when shooting or otherwise, increases the grip), a USB cable for getting pics on your PC, a CD with software including the finepix viewer, owner's manual and a software manual.Never even needed to go through the software manual while installing the softwares on a Windows 2000 machine. The software to transfer images looks good. The software CD includes 3/4 other softwares which I haven't used till now. One is the movie player for recorded movies (the .avi movies don't play on windows media player). The manuals are easy to read and understand. There's no TV output like Canon Elph and other expensive ones. The movies recorded are not so great but then this isn't a camcorder !Other features include a low battery warning, date/time setting, image size/compression ratio setting, flash mode/white balance settings, camera shake warning and macro setting. The flash setting does come to a good use at many times.One downfall is that the max 1/2 sec shutter time means that night pictures on streets are not good. In case you want to do lots of night photography, nikon coolpix 775 or canon digital elph s110 or s300 are better options. But remember that others come with proprietary batteries which may become unavailable or cost a lot.The other disadvantage in my opinion is the smartmedia card, since most things are swichting over to compact flash. However the fuji rebate solves this problem for now ! As far as the design goes it very good. Yoiu might feel that the camera is slightly thicker given its width/height. The battery/smartmedia card both go in the same compartment and the door to it looks sligthly cheap.The playback mode for movies/pics is very good. You can zoom in and out of pics and erase one/all pics. The software menu on the camera seems pretty good and intelligent.Another recommendation is to buy a big smartemedia card (max that can be used is 128MB). This will make your camera more useful. Finally the manual claims 150-300 frames with one pair of fully charged batteries depending on LCD usage. In case rechartgable batteries run out, you can use normal AA ones. Carrying one or two more pairs of batteries will be great and solves the problem of LCD eating the batteries (you can't do this with camera's that have proprietary ones). After all NiMH AA batteries are so inexpensive ! A Fuji kit for 2600 is also available which includes a cmaera case, lens cleaning kit, tripod, 4 NiMH batteries and one more recharger.", "Date": "December 1, 2001"}, {"Title": "A very impressive camera at a great price", "Author": "Brian Lehman", "ReviewID": "RUCM7H0OJIJ48", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is really an incredible deal.  It has more features for the money that any other camera in its range.  Other cameras that are similarly priced lack the 2-megapixel sensor or optical zoom, but the FinePix 2600 has both.  It takes very nice pictures and is very easy to use.  It comes with a 16MB card that provides more than enough initial storage, and new cards can be purchased up to 128MB.  But even the standard card holds a lot - 60 at the default setting, 10 at the highest setting.  The optical zoom is a great feature to have, and the movie mode is also very useful.  Despite what some specs may read, it has both a macro mode and a self-timer.  Overall, this is the best camera to buy in its range, that is, more than a toy but not high-end.  It is more than adequate for the casual or amateur photographer.  It should serve all your photography needs for quite some time.", "Date": "October 30, 2001"}, {"Title": "Just buy it, you'll love it!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3QO695YX5OIV1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've taken literally about 1000 shots since I bought the camera 1 month ago.  Yes, everyone loves this camera, but it is not perfect.  The LCD cannot be seen well in bright daylight conditions, so I use the view finder and everything is fine.  That's it.  No big deal for such a small, reliable camera that takes great pics.Cool things I especially like:-Included software is VERY helpful at managing lots of photos through helpful automatic pic re-naming and storage options.-Macro mode makes close-ups and EXTREME close-ups (to 10cms!) very crisp, clear and in-focus.-Free Fujifilm.net service is integrated into software allowing you to post !100MBs! of pics online at no charge for up to 30 days for viewing by friends, family, etc., making print orders a snap.Recommendations:-Track down the ($) rebate for combined purchase of Camera and SmartMedia card or digital photo processing.-Get a big SmartMedia card to get up to 166 top res shots onto a 128MB card.", "Date": "November 25, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - easy, fun, FABULOUS prints!", "Author": "Letty Schamp", "ReviewID": "R8XOIUWA27IYS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a fair amount of research prior to deciding on the Fuji FinePix 2600.  Other top contenders were the Canon Powershot A40 and the Sony DSC-P51. I used these reviews to make my decision, so I figured I'd offer my opinion as well.My primary use for a camera is for family photos, vacation shots, etc.  I wanted a camera that was mostly automatic with some minor manual controls.  The camera had to be very user friendly.  And lastly, I wanted a digital camera that was pretty much going to replace my 35 mm camera...I wanted a camera that would produce 4x6 and 5x7 prints with quality as good as (or better than) my existing 35 mm camera.  After using this camera A LOT in the past week, I have to say that I am extremely satisfied with the camera and the 4x6 prints are REMARKABLE.  The prints are very crisp with excellent color, both indoor and out.  The prints do not look grainy at all like you might expect from a digital camera.  I used the highest resolution setting for the photos and had them printed at a local camera shop lab(Cord Camera).  I did not work in unique lighting situations, but for fairly normal lighting, the photos were great.The software was easy to load (Win 98), but it's more of a photo management rather than a photo editing software.  You can dump and save your photos, crop photos, or change the resolution, but the software does not allow you to do black & white, change contract, or other editing features.Movie mode is cool, although no sound.  However, the .AVI files are saved as Windows Media Player files but the loaded media player that is installed with the software would not play them.  I had to watch the movies in the FinePix software or load them into Quicktime which was a bit of a pain.  I think in order for me to  get the Windows Media Player to play the files, I'd have to download a file off the internet.  It would be free but would take forever with my slow dial-up connection...not worth it for me.  I didn't buy this camera for the movie mode, so this slightly annoying way of viewing the movie files wasn't worth me worrying about too much.The camera is very easy to learn to use.  A few possible negatives that I can report is the fact that the camera actually takes the photograph a fraction of a second after you push down the button (which is a bit frustrating when photographing a 3 year old that won't sit still!) and the fact that the LCD screen is tough to see in bright sunlight or dark conditions.  But I think these two factors are issues with most (or all?) digital cameras rather than just this specific FinePix 2600.Things that helped me make my decision over the Canon A40 and the Sony P51:1.  Takes 2 batteries whereas the Canon takes 4.2.  Batteries are rechargeable and a charger is included whereas the Canon and Sony don't include rechargeables/charger.3.  Came with a 16 MB memory card whereas the Canon came with an 8 MB card.I realize that the above items are minor but they are important considerations when it comes down to upfront cost of the camera and supplies.  If the Fuji FinePix had not produced such AWESOME quality photo prints, I probably would have returned it and tried the Sony or tried a 3 MP camera.  But after my first development order and a few days of playing around with the camera, I was totally hooked on the Fuji.  I truly love this camera and would recommend it to anyone.  This camera may motivate me to become more of a camera hobbiest rather than just a casual camera user.", "Date": "July 15, 2002"}, {"Title": "Fuji 2600 well worth the $$$", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RRN3RX1UOQMM8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've looked at a lot of cameras, this is the first camera, in it's price range, which really delivers on it's promise.  The 1.8\" LCD is quite adequate and is much better than on earlier finepix models. Finally, this model comes with video and a 16MB smartcard.  You should buy a larger card if you intend to use the video feature.  This is a great point and shoot camera, which shares the features of other, more expensive competitors.", "Date": "September 27, 2001"}, {"Title": "excellent camera", "Author": "Vincent S. Yeung", "ReviewID": "R3MFGVAHWSVVOQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera early December and have used it throughout the holiday season.  It's my first digital camera and I absolutely love it.The quality of the pictures are very good (my friend using a more expensive Canon camera took same picture as I and mine was significantly clearer; I don't know if it was because of different settings, however).  The LCD display is decent and the controls are very intuitive.  There is also a 10-sec timer mode and a macro mode for close-up pictures.  The included charger works very well (takes about 5 hours for a full charge) and the two included Ni-MH batteries are 1700 mAh, which last fairly long.  One word of precaution though: the first one or two times you use the camera, the batteries will seem to run out very quickly.  This is supposedly due to the \"memory effect\" and the problem is gone after a few full charges.  It also happens if you charge you batteries before they're fully discharged (however, unlike the old Ni-Cad rechargeables, Ni-MH's are not physically harmed--they just seem to run out faster.  After a few full discharges and recharges, they work fine again).  I got 4 backup 1600 mAh recently at an electronics store and now I can go to a trip without worrying about running out while I'm outside (just fyi, the included charger holds two batteries max and is compatible with all voltages, which means you only have to find the proper outlet \"shape\" adapter if you travel outside of the country)With a 64MB card that I got with the Fujifilm rebate (I believe the promotion is over now) I'm able to take 150+ images at the 2M, Normal resolution.  But the provided 16 MB card is quite decent for starters, especially if you use a lower resolution.The optical zoom (which makes the camera totally worth its cost) works really well and the lens are really quiet.The movie function (limited to 20 second intervals with no sound)is quite good.  They are converted to .avi format during upload on a Windows machine (I'm not sure about Mac's though).  However, you cannot use optical zoom while taking movies and there's no flash, which brings us to the major gripe about this product...The flash is exceeding white, which can change the tones of the pictures (making the colors less vibrant, in my opinion).  However, the problem is if you turn the flash off, you must not move your hands *at all* or else the pictures become really blurry.  However, if you use a tripod or put the camera on a steady surface (e.g. table) when you take the picture, it comes out just fine and the colors are really nice.  But usually I'd rather just leave the flash on and have slightly \"whiter\" colors.  This is stated in the camera's included manual.  However, when the environment has enough lighting, if you or the camera's auto-flash mode chooses not to use flash, the pictures come out really nicely, which leads to the conclusion that the camera needs enough light (either from the flash or enough external lighting) to produce clear pictures, or else you'd have to have really steady hands.  One of the reviewers before me mentioned the camera's inability to take pictures with slight movement.  I believe his problem was the one I mentioned.  He probably decided to turn the flash off or something along those lines and so consequently got blurry pictures.The other problem with this camera is that it collects dust and dirt really easily.  Therefore, you should find a case for it ASAP (as I did for mine).  Just one day after I got it, I discovered a scratch/stain-like spot on the lens, which fortunately has not affected the pictures but is still quite frustrating.  Just today I found a small piece of dust collected inside the peek-through viewfinder, which also fortunately does not affect the functioning of the camera.  All in all, I did months of research before finally buying this camera (it came down to this or the Kodak 3600, and I'm happy about my choice--however, Amazon can be a little sketchy in terms of...)In summary,pros-- good picture quality-- good LCD display-- intuitive controls-- included quality rechargeable batteries and charger-- good optical zoom-- movie function-- \"bang for da buck\"cons-- flash too bright; alters colors-- pictures in dark areas get blurry without flash unless a tripod or other steady surface is used to hold the camera-- collects dusts, dirt, grease really easily", "Date": "January 22, 2002"}, {"Title": "An excellent camera/wonderful value.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R236N2C0XVU6XI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a couple of weeks and it really has greatly exceeded my expectations. The following will be random thoughts so far about the product:1. The camera is even smaller than I expected, which is certainly a good thing. For those who do not want to carry around a bulky camera, this is excellent. It fits comfortably in my top shirt pocket.2. The build is fairly strong, although not terrific. As with any piece of equipment, you have to be careful to not drop it.3. The camera takes 2 AA rechargable batteries. The battery life in the camera is impressive. On a recent day, I took 152 pictures (using the LCD screen for some shots, only looking through the viewfinder for others, no flash) and the camera still wasn't showing \"low battery\" at the end of the day. These batteries cost about [$-$]each battery and are available at CompUSA or most speciality camera stores. A battery charger is also included.4. The memory card slot is a little risky. By that I mean you have to be careful when putting it in. The cards are delicate and to put them in and pull them out requires not a huge amount of care, but you can't be walking and change it while you walk.5. The camera is wonderfully user friendly. There is a manual lens cap of sorts (slide it over, it clicks twice and you're ready to shoot, turn off the camera and then slide it back). The LCD screen offers bright, easy-to-read options. You can control the flash (red-eye control, etc.) and adjust things like white level/EV. The camera is a max of 2 megapixels, but the user can adjust the levels - 2 megapixel fine, normal, basic and then 1 megapixel normal/basic and finally, VGA (which is something like 120k, I think) The LCD screen is also a very nice size. While it's not easy to take the memory card out on-the-fly, it's very simple to quickly change up quality, effects, etc.6. The camera can take 20 seconds of video. These files are about 3 megabytes in size and you can take multiple little videos, depending on the memory card.7. The camera includes a 16 megabyte memory card, which is very nice to start off, although I highly recommend at least a 64 meg. card. (at the lowest resolution, the camera can take over 400 pictures on a 64mb card)8. The LCD screen offers how many images are left, even when you switch to another resolution.9. The camera only takes SmartMedia cards. Still, amazon.com, for example, has plenty of these cards to choose from and they're not terribly expensive.10. Overall, an excellent camera.

(as if the subject is bathed in flourescent lighting even when there is natural light in the room)  be warned, however, that i have heard this is a problem with many digital flashes.  the resulting color problem can be corrected by turning off the flash or using the supressed flash, however, you must be very good at holding the camera ABSOLUTELY still or you'll get a blurry picture (quite often for me).  another major problem i have found is that when used at certain angles or distances, the lense tends to add a slight curvature to otherwise straight objects, sometimes lending a slight \"fish-eye\" effect.  another annoying feature is that there is no battery meter so that you are only aware you have little battery power left right before you run out.  also, be forewarned when you're budgeting that after purchasing this camera, i ended up having to purchase another smart media card with more memory, a nicer printer and photopaper, and a cd burner to store all of my images somewhere other than my hard drive.  of coures, with newer computers, these things may not be as much of an issue.  all in all, i would have to say that given the chance to go back, i would have spent more money and bought a nicer camera (with a better lense!) since i really do love using a digital now.", "Date": "August 12, 2002"}, {"Title": "Overall of very good camera", "Author": "flyingclimber", "ReviewID": "RZNIJC5M65ZUB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would have to say that this one of the best digital cameras i have seen in this price range.

Two things that bug me are, that if you use the supressed flashmode (no flash) then you really need to hold it very still because you can get a blurry shot very easily.

We discovered that the biggest problem with digital cameras besides the fact that they all eat alkaline batteries is educating yourself before you buy so you don't get one that you'll regret later. If you are like my wife and I you don't want to do a lot of thinking or reading to get going with taking pictures once you buy. This camera took all of a minute to master the functions and we did that in the store before buying it. It is as simple as pointing and clicking. I am amazed at how good the pictures come out everytime. The 16 mb smart media card that comes with it has proven to be plenty of storage space for us. I upload to the computer every 20 shots and thats a lot of pictures for us. ( We've never been big picture takers til now) For the money this is a best buy. You'll need to call Fuji for the AC adapter because we found out that its hard to find. Like us, you'll notice you put nose prints on the display screen but all that we looked at had this same problem. My HP 1115 photosmart printer and this 2600Zoom Finepix get along great and the quality of the prints are excellent. I haven't had any problmes with the camera matching up to windows 98se on my computer. The camera has a quality feel to it and its small enough that it fits in my wifes purse easily. You won't regret this camera if you purchase it. Its great. The first charge got us over 275 Pictures before needing recharged.

Storing pictures to a floppy is a breeze and to a CD is slightly harder but it can also be done easily. The resolution of the 20 second video mode is a bit disappointing but I found this to be true with all of the digital cameras.

They come in all shapes and sizes, with an assortment of different features, and various types of memory media and associated software.  For the thoughtful consumer, the whole task can become an exercise in information overload.Traditional photography is a hobby of mine, and I own several 35mm single lens reflex (SLR) type cameras, and a couple of point and shoots.  My intention is to purchase a pro level digital SLR, when the prices come down a bit.  In the meantime, I was looking for an inexpensive digital point and shoot.  My main consideration was price, and I wanted the most camera I could get for around $200.  It seemed that a 2 megapixel camera would be the most I could afford.  Reading numerous reviews, I quickly became overloaded with data, and bounced around between several brands and models before finally choosing the Fuji 2600Z.  This solid entry level, digital point and shoot camera has a 3X optical zoom lens, which provides performance, equivalent to a 38-114mm lens in a regular film camera.  Autofocus is crisp, and Image quality is excellent throughout the focal range.The camera has very basic features.  The flash mode has five options, auto flash, forced flash, suppressed flash, red-eye reduction and slow synchro flash (for night shooting).  For most indoor applications, using flash is typically recommended, and unit has so far produced excellent results indoors when flash is used.  There is a macro mode, which also produces great images.  Range is listed as from 4 to 30 inches from the lens.  In timer mode, the camera operates after the standard 10 second delay.  All options are accessed via the menu, which is displayed on the rear 1.8\" LCD screen.  Other options include image quality (image file size), power save option, and setting the date and time.  The LCD like those for most digital cameras, is difficult to see in bright daylight, so changing settings can be difficult in that situation.The 2600Z has three modes, \"still image\" (camera), \"playback\" (image display and video playback), and \"movie\" mode.  These are pretty self-explanatory.  In movie mode, the camera will capture up to 20 seconds of video.  In playback mode, you may watch your video, or view the images retained in the camera's memory.  Still images can be viewed either one by one, full screen, or up to a maximum of nine mini images at once, on a three by three array on the LCD.  Even at the reduced size, images are easily recognizable, and the colors are true.  When in full screen viewing mode, you can also zoom in, and then pan the image.  Unwanted images can of course be erased. That is about it for the features.  The camera comes with a 16MB smart media card, two 1700mAh AA size NiMH batteries and a charger, special USB cord, strap, and a CD with software for downloading images from the camera.  The software takes a while to install, but if all goes well, then your camera will download your images very quickly.  You will probably want a larger size card, but 16MB is not bad for a starter, and will hold about 45 medium quality images.  Supposedly the camera will accept cards up to a maximum of 128MB.  The rechargeable batteries, are a nice addition to the package, and the battery life of the NiMH's has been very good so far.  There is also abundant documentation for both the camera, and software provided with the product.As this is the first digital I've owned, I don't have a lot to compare it to.  I have been using it for only around three weeks, but so far I have no major complaints, and have been pleasantly surprised at the image quality.  It does what I need, and is so simple to operate.  Most users should have no major problems.  Within the limitations of its design, the camera delivers on all counts, and provides value for the money, that equals or surpasses most other cameras in its class.  The camera is a bit thicker than some other models, so pick one up and handle it to see if it feels comfortable in your hands.  Because of its thickness, the camera may not slide smoothly into some tight pockets.This model has been on the market for a while, and may become available at bargain prices as it is phased out.  If you're not seeking the newest model, and want a basic point and shoot, at a reasonable price, my recommendation would be to wait for a sale and pick one up.  Then go and have some fun, taking photos you never dreamed of taking before.", "Date": "November 12, 2002"}, {"Title": "FinePix Takes Fine Pix!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3H0Y4Y9OVK5FO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the first time I have written an on-line review of a product.  They have been helpful to me though so hopefully this will assist others in their research as well.This is a great digital camera for those wanting a point and shoot type that takes fantastic shots.  I was stunned by the clarity of the photos in nearly all shooting environments.  I have been mainly using the lowest res. setting (VGA)and still find the picture quality superb.  I would recommend this setting if you are wanting to get more shots out of the Smart Media card you are using.  With the 16MB card that comes with it you can get up to 122 shots using the VGA setting.  This is best for e-mail & web pages.  As others have mentioned though, you can set for a higher quality and always reduce later for this.  If you use the 1M setting (default)you can shoot 49 pix, 2M setting 39.  My purchase came with a 64MB card as well.  Having a 64MB will give you the following:  VGA - 497 shots, 1M - 198 shots, 2M - 159 shots.  These are just some guidelines however as the quality size can also be changed from Fine, Normal & Basic.  Above counts are at Normal mode.I am using XP and did not have to download any add'l drivers or updates as an earlier review had mentioned.  Perhaps they have updated the included software.  Installation was a breeze.  Battery life seems to last quite a while after the first initial use and recharge, even with LCD on.  Comes with two batteries & charger.  I bought four more though so battery life isn't a problem.  I also bought a SmartMedia card reader but I actually took this back.  I found that the supplied USB cable works fine.  Downloads are fast and really don't seem to put any add'l strain on the batteries.I have yet to use the movie mode so I can't comment on this.  I didn't purchase the camera for this however.The menu on the LCD is quite easily navigated for any setting changes, picture deletions, etc.Why only 4 out of 5 stars?  Flash.  As others have mentioned it is quite brite and does sometimes change flesh tones in auto mode.  I have found this to be more of a problem the closer you are to your subject though.  Majority of the time the flash actually helps in an indoor environment.In closing I'll say this.  I had also been considering a higher end camera for around $[money].  I found this camera to have many of the same features + a 16MB card included rather than an 8MB.  Initially I was a bit hesitant to purchase this camera due to the lower cost.  After about two weeks of use I can say I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend it.

The regular batteries died in about 5 minutes though.  After the rechargables were charged, I put them in and I played with the camera all day.  I must have taken over 200 shots yesterday (deleting alot, and transfering to computer) and the rechargables didnt die until about 11pm last night!  The pictures are VERY VERY VERY clear, and sharp.  I was able to hold about 45 pictures in the default settings, and Im off to the store now for a 128 meg card!  This camera is my first digital camera and I am so pleased with it.

It's wonderful for taking pictures of our newborn and posting them immediately to the web, which is a big deal to the grandparents.  It's nice to just click away and not worry about the cost (film+processing=alot).Weaknesses would be a weak flash, past 10ft is pointless.  And, what seems like a slow write time, (maybe its all digitals though) sometimes takes 3 or 4 seconds before you can take another picture.  I really like my Canon(film) for taking up to 10 shots per second.Strengths would be it takes really good pictures.  The Macro feature is awesome.  Great for taking close-up face pictures of the baby.  The included software is great for picture organization, poor for editing, but I have photoshop for that.  The optical zoom is also handy, sometimes \"moving your feet\" ruins the shot.

Yeah, sure you can use the regular viewhole, which is alright...but one reason to go digital is for the LCD when taking pictures. Along with this problem that people tend to forget is that if the LCD screen is too dark (or light), that means the videos you shoot with the camera are also too dark. That's okay if you don't use the video option, which I rarely do, but with those special occasions, I was unable to capture the moments due to the dark (light) conditions. There is a LCD brightness adjuster, but it tends to be not very effective...I've seen other cameras do a MUCH better job in these types of conditions...-a bit chunky...though I put it in my purse or backpack, so I don't notice that much.

The only real problem I have with the 2600 is its low light capabilities.  It doesn't like to autofocus in less than bright conditions.  In anything less than bright light, pictures come out grainy and faded.  The flash doesn't help a whole lot, either.  I'd say the effective range is probably 5 or 6 feet.Overall, it's a GREAT camera for the money.

I settled on this camera because it had the features I had decided I needed and I happened into a great deal price-wise. I'm not one to read every word of a manual,( only when absolutely necessary!) but this camera was easy to figure out with a little input from the manual and a knowledgeable salesman. The software however, was another story! Once I actually took my first picture and was able to get the software working though, I was really impressed! The self timer was easy to master- the options are easily applied and work! -and the battery life is surprisingly good compared to the horror stories told in most reveiws for digital cameras! The camera has an automatic feature that allows picture taking in low light to be as easy as in full light;  and since I'm still new at this, I'm certain it will become old hat in no time to use the other features (I've tried them all with the help of the manual, but I'm sure the manual will collect dust soon!). The software was a challenge, but as I write this review I have to admit most software that proclaims to be Windows XP compatible is a challenge, so I can't say with any certainty if the problem lies with Fuji or Windows XP. All in all, I'm more than satisfied with my purchase, to date. The camera itself is small yet sturdy and the results are beyond what I expected after the all of the comparisons between 2 and 3 mp's I was subjected to by the various salespeople. The pictures are sharp, clean and the color is great! (and it's easily enhanced right on the LCD screen if you don't like it!) Fuji is definitely a viable product for this price! I would highly recommend this camera as a first time camera to those who are somewhat knowledgeable in the tech-field, however if you're like the woman standing next me when I bought mine who was ...'loooking for a camera for her husband that had no difficulty in using with his computer...' look to one of the cameras with a docking station and single button load to the pc. This isn't technologically challenging (or I for one would've returned mine!) but it does require some knowledge and experience with installing and running (expecially with the windows XP version!)programs and connecting hardware properly.

First, the viewfinder is positioned right on top of the LCD screen, resulting in a lot of nose-print smudges on the screen.  Secondly, this camera is geared more towards people who want true \"point and shoot\" photography - it gives you very little manual control over settings such as aperture, shutter speed, etc.  If you're looking for more control, you'll probably want to look elsewhere.

What I really like about the 2600 is the easy to read menu (much easier than previous models with larger print and most things are color coded)and the positive double snap of the clamshell lens cover which lets you know positively when it is open and shut. I have always liked Fuji's quality and reliability.As you know, the 2800 is hard to see thru the viewfinder in anything but bright light. I tried it at a camera store. I liked that they are trying to get to a digital version of an SLR, but the 2800 is not it. Get the 2600, it is like an updated version of the 1400. The Fuji lens is I think the best of all brands. It is really sharp in all compression ratios. For those who are picky about scratches on the plastic body, I am told there is a polyester soft type cover available for the body to help with this.

The features are impressive for this price range. This camera can do quite a lot (stills, short movies, and be a webcam). The basic picture quality (1M) is fantastic. The quality is FAR better than scanning a regular photograph if you intend on using this for the internet. In fact, the photographic quality is far superior to some 35mm cameras (e.g. my olympus infinity), but nowhere near as good as a medium format camera.The memory isn't very large and I would agree with the suggestions about getting a viking memory card. The larger Viking memory cards will allow you to save around 166 pictures in high quality mode. You can see your photos immediately after, which means deleting any goof ups. The batteries that come with the camera need charging, but will allow you to take a few pics. The AC adapter for this camera is a necessity since you can use it as a webcamera.

Not only because it was the very first digital camera I ever owned and bought, but because of the great quality pictures it always rendered. I didn't know that, however, until I stupidly gave the camera away to a friend. I automatically believed any future camera I were to buy would give the same outstanding results, and indeed, most of the many cameras that were to follow that one did give me outstanding results. However, like I said, there was something \"unique\" in the pics this one captured. It always produced the brightest and richest colors and details. Nothing ever seemed to be \"off\" in the pics. Its macro capability always impressed me as well. I feel its macro capability was always underrated. Of course, this camera 'is' limited in that it is only a meager 2 megapixels and has no real manual capabilities to speak of, but you don't really need them if you are satisfied to take pictures in good lighting. Personally, I have taken really good pics indoors in dim situations using the flash and have been satisfied. Each photographic situation may vary of course. Outdoors though, on any bright sunny day is when this camera really shines with the pics it renders. I know that this camera is almost impossible to find now, but if you happen upon one (used or otherwise) and you can trust the seller you definitely should buy it.By the way, my friend would not give back the camera even when I offered to pay him a good amount.

I have also found that the white balance in shots taken under florescent lights can be less than perfect.  It also bothers me you can't view photos on the LCD unless the lens cover is open.The pictures are good,  but I found I was tweaking every one by adjusting the brightness and contrast. My previous camera (Olympus D-360L) never required this.  OK, I am picky. I admit it. In addition, using the zoom allows you to be further from your subject- but remember the flash may not be able to cover that distance.  This isn't specific to the 2600- but keep it in mind.  Based on the average review I've seen here, this is one HOT camera.

I did my research, read reviews, and checked out the prices of all the other 2MP cameras. I had thought about buying a Canon Digital Elph, but a number of factors pointed me to this camera. The very first thing I noticed is that it holds well and is comfortable to hold. Many of the other \"boxy\" type cameras almost made my hand cramp they were poorly ergonomically designed. Then as I played with the camera more I noticed the features it had for a relatively reasonable price. I could get a 2MP camera for about the same price as a high-end 1MP, and without all the customization features that an amateur photographer like me isn't going to use very often, if at all. In the 2 months that I've used this camera, I have been pleasantly surprised. Sure this camera has its drawbacks, but what camera is perfect? Some of the biggest complaints I have are: the display is almost impossible to see in direct sunlight, the flash can be overpowering in certain situations, and you will get massive blur if you're not careful in non-flash situations.  Given all that, I found the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks of this great camera.

I managed to find a refurbished one for quite a bit less, and I still use it. It's developed some problems over 10 years, but just last week for Easter, I took a photo of my daughters after their Easter Egg hunt, and the resulting photo was so eye-poppingly gorgeous and crisp that we printed it at 8x10, which is about the limit of its 2MP CCD. My wife and I have framed it and are sending 5x7's to our parents. It's THAT GOOD.Several members of my family have acquired digital cameras since then, all advertising higher megapixels or whatever, but their image quality was consistently poor from the start, often looking washed out even after processing on a computer (the GIMP is a great tool). Their menus also tended to be confusing and hard to use; the 2600's was direct and simple, and the manual mode was truly manual -- the only thing you lost was the self-timer. (Crap.)From what I see, it's now available for $25-40.

Using the 2M-N quality configuration (that's two megapixels with normal resolution), I get very nice 1600 X 1200 pictures that are just the right size for printing on 8\u00bd X 11 photo paper. The colors are usually good in automatic configuration, though I had to adjust the White Balance when shooting indoor with neon light to prevent the skin tones from looking greenish. Plus the shots are about 300-350k each and I can store 153 shots on my 64Mb SmartMedia card.The flash is decent for such a small camera and the red-eye reduction works most of the time, but not if the subject is not looking straight at the camera. You can also take pictures without flash (if it's dark and the object you're shooting is too far for the flash to be effective for example), but I've had lots of problems doing so. Since there is no manual shutter speed setting, you have to rely on the camera for adjsting its speed. This results in very blurry images since it is impossible to stop your hands from shaking for a whole 2 seconds while the shot is being taken. So use a tripod (which I don't have) for pictures without flash.The LCD screen is pretty good, but when you use it indoor or in dark conditions it is hard to see what your shot will look like. The brightness setting will just make things look awful. The viewfinder is a good replacement, but the fact that the LCD screen is raised on the back of the camera results in your nose touching the screen when you take a picture which is annoying since you have to clean it all the time.The movie mode (without sound) is a nice addition, but the 3Mb / 10 frames/second avi files are far from perfect. I prefer to use it only for a nice 360 degrees view of the surrondings.Battery life is good, I took 179 shots with the viewfinder plus the LCD to check if my pictures were OK before the batteries died.As for the software bundled with the camera, I haven't tried it out, since I just have to take the SmartMedia card right into my Toshiba Laptop to view my pictures.I would recommend this camera to any amateur photograph (like me!) who is on a budget, wants a camera with excellent picture quality and dosen't plan to do lots of night or very dark shots.An easy 4 out of 5 stars.", "Date": "June 10, 2002"}, {"Title": "One overlooked feature", "Author": "J.

The lens cover needs an extra push to get it in place to take a picture.  Have said that, the camera image is wonderful outdoors, and the LCD is big and beatiful.

Tried two others including the Finepix 2400 and decided to keep this one.  Wanted a point and shoot that I could print up to 8 x 10's with and this camera does just that.  Very easy to use and setup. Find the rechargable batteries lasting a long time compared with the alkaline (they must be used and recharged to get full benefit). Color is very true to life.  Not finding much motion blur at all which was a problem with the 2400. I did buy Adobe's Photoshop Elements program to go with the camera.  Printed a great 8 x 10 of my son at the piano during his recital before Christmas and relatives thought it was professionally done.  Have a good photo printer which helps. Macro mode works great.

We truly had a wonderful time with it over the holidays. There is nothing like telling your 7-year old's, \"Go take some pictures!\" This camera is that easy to use. The images it produces are great and the flash works wonderfully. The colors are very nice, and the viewing software for the PC is very simple to use. Fuji even provided 1700 mAh batteries (which are state-of-the-art). Make sure that you get something close to that, and get several sets. The only dissapointments are that only compressed images are available, and that there is no lens filter to protect the lens from kids fingers and accidents while shooting pictures.

I would recommend it for it's wonderful image quality and ease of use. I know those who read these reviews like to hear the downsides, so I'll say them, but realize that they are puny in comparison.It works as a WebCam as well, but the resulting video is WAY to dark. I have 2 100Watt lights shining directly on me from 2 feet away and it's finally bright enough. Don't expect to use it heavily for webcamming.Like most digital cameras, it's flash is VERY white. What I mean by that is that the resulting pictures are not very colorful because the flash has to be so bright. This is probably because of the same reason the webcam is dim: The component that receives the light and converts it to a digital image requires a LOT of light to make a good image. The camera has a cool feature that allows you to increase the exposure time. This is great for absolutely still shots, but, of course not good for action shots.That's about it.

It's original raison d'etre it has fulfilled well - in transitioning my wife from 35mm to digital.  it's small, reasonably light and as a 'point and shoot', obtains reasonable pictures.However to diverge from automatic control is fiddly and slightly masked by an iconic menu system - where a word would save several pictures.  The manufacturer's offering of 16Mb card + 2 alkaline batteries is woefully inadequate - I'd prefer it came with no card and save a few pennies.  32Mb is adequate; 64 is good.Realistically, it has to be used with rechargeable batteries - a charging circuit in the camera would be a good start.The software is abysmal - both Mac and PC.  The Webcam mode is useless and not available for Mac (no mention of this on the manufacturer's site); the 'fine pix' photoeditor is slow and painful (tip for mac users, just plug it in, copy the files over and use iphoto or graphics converter) - again save some money and don't even bother with the CD.  Also the Mac version refused to load until a lot of weird tricks were done.The xD cards are small and fast but are yet another standard which is incompatible with Smart Media, Sony Memory Stick, Compact Flash etc...  Price seems reasonable.Low light or indoor photographs are problematic using the automatic settings.Overall not bad and an excellent 'starter' camera albeit with anoying limitations.", "Date": "April 12, 2003"}, {"Title": "Well pleased!", "Author": "Mitchel G. \"Granday\"", "ReviewID": "R1SBAM45MSEI82", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little camera was a very wise purchase. ....

Each and every one of them were out of stock for this item.  I even called and emailed Fuji about the 2600s lack of availability.  Here I am ready to spend about $400 on this camera and accessories and no one will even call me back or reply mail me about it.  The rebate was good until 1-31-02.  A few days after the rebate expired, I am notified that this item is now in stock and for sale.  I may be splitting hairs here or just plain frugal, but I cannot help but notice the timing.  I was ready to buy this item ASAP for over a month but now will not do so because of what I percieve to be shady business practices.  Perhaps if a rep. from Fuji lets me know that they will extend the rebate time due to this item's inavailability I will consider purchasing this product.
