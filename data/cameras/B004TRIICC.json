{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good pen once you figure it out!", "Author": "ajeoae", "ReviewID": "R39B7DK3EQYI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There's a few of these on Amazon under different names, but it is the same pen depicted in the product's picture.  Where to start...  The pen itself is of medium quality, and does write well out of the box.  Mine came in a nice box, but the pen itself was a little sticky at the top as if it has a sticker on it at some point.  The instruction manual is primarily why I'm giving this pen 3 stars instead of 4.  It is primarily in Chinese, and the English translation is very VERY hard to understand...nearly maddening.  I almost wish I got a text version of the Chinese manual so I could run it through Google Translate.  But for anyone that's bought this pen or thinking of getting one, here's what to keep in mind:1. You'll need to get a miniSD card separately.  The pen does not seem to have any internal storage.2. You have to put the pen into \"standby\" mode to get things going..this is iniated by holding the button for a second or two to get the light solid blue3. Once the light is blue you can either a) breifly tap the button to take snapshots or b) hold in the button for 3 seconds/release and it'll start recording4. When recording, there's no light indication.  To stop recording, hold in the button for a few seconds to get it back to \"standby\" blue5. Hold in the button for about 10 seconds to shut it off completely (it'll flash blue and red then turn off)The quality is fairly decent for a low cost camera pen and the battery so far does seem to hold up well under a full charge (atleast an hour while recording).  Once you get past the manual and initial expirimenting, it's not bad at all.  I didn't get a chance to use it as a webcam (after plugging it in, hold the button for a few seconds and the removable storage disappears as it goes into webcam mode).  I probably wouldn't recommend it unless you have gamma/contrast correction within your webcam software.  By default, it struggles a little under low lighting...and the quality is what you'd expect from a mid grade smartphone.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "peekee boo", "Author": "truthbtold", "ReviewID": "R1C2N3IB04GWRL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "wont stay on, it comes on but then it goes right back off, and the pictures and videos it does take are real clear and nice.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "sucks", "Author": "chris", "ReviewID": "R3T4X2QNO3VLJP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This pen blows for many reasons1.
