{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Comparing to NV10", "Author": "C. Murray", "ReviewID": "R1FGXRVAKY3A1G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the upgrade to my old camera (the NV10) because I was excited about all the new features.  I believe the file quality is better, the noise is less apparent, the ISO has a better range, and the flash is no longer a pop-up, which is great, because I used to always put my finger over it!  There are a few changes that I don't care for.  One being they changed the location of the charger/usb port to the side--it is harder to insert the cable and likely that I'll break off the rubber part they include to cover the port.  With the old version, I never noticed the flash going off twice before taking the picture (which I assume is for focus or red eye), but now the delay is a hassle and when taking pictures of people, they assume the shot is taken and move before the shutter actually captures the image.  I do like the new modes, they make it a little bit easier for beginners to use the program modes.  I don't like that the black and white option is on the dial--it took me a few minutes while at an event to figure out why it was in black and white, when I had never set it to do that, and it's because the dial had accidently been turned while in my bag.  So I would suggest getting to know the camera pretty well before taking it to something important (always a good plan anyway) because not all of the settings are ultra obvious to turn off or on.  Overall, I think it's a very nice camera for a very reasonable price, there are just a few things that I'm not sure why they changed them from the original.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Retractble lens is easily damaged", "Author": "Scott Salley", "ReviewID": "R2NOUC2RDQN25R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought one of these for my wife and within two weeks it was no longer functioning because the lens could not 'open' and 'close' properly.
