An optical zoom is so standard on cameras that I didn't even notice that this camera didn't have one.  It does have a digital zoom but on this camera, it's useless.  If you use the digital zoom at all you loose resolution... and not just a little.  The picture is severly compromised.

Actually, because it does not have a zoom lens it starts up fast, has a slim design and is less expensive than comparable models with a zoom. I rarely have a need for a zoom lens anyway. Also, It makes a great second or backup camera when your rechargeable battery camera is dead and you don't have 1 or 2 hours to recharge batteries for it. The A503 uses AAs. You can use any AAs from real cheap ones to the more expensive AA lithiums. (The new AA NiOX batteries promise to be exceptional for the price.)

The price was right, in fact better than what I thought for a 5 megapixel camera, and all the previous reviews pointed to a really good product.Based on that, I purchased one, and so far I have to say I have not really been disappointed. The battery life is very good for a digital camera, and the picture quality is well above par. It is a very easy camera to use, and it comes with features that can make an average photographer such as myself take better than average pictures.For all its pros however there are a couple cons which I have found. The first is the onboard memory. In 5 megapixel mode, only 10 pictures can be stored, and that seems on the low end. The purchase of a memory card though solves that problem rather easily.The other thing is that it only has digital zoom. Granted, the digital zoom works well and the pictures turn out great. However as one other commentor pointed out, analog zoom is pretty much a standard feature in digital cameras, and to not have it is somewhat of a disappointment, though one I can live with. It's just having a sundae without the cherry on top.Overall, I cannot say I am unhappy with the product. There are certainly better digital cameras on the market, but not for the price this one lists at.
