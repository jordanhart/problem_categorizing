{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This is the camera for me, I love it!", "Author": "Scott T.", "ReviewID": "R3PUFKNJ372OXF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera is Awesome! Has Tons of features I love, and will use!The package:1.The kit comes with 2 lenses, One has a pouch, the other does not. but that is ok. Both Lenses are great!2.The SD card reader is not what was shown, But I like the one I got better. Its smaller, more compact, I do wish there was a USB cap over the USB port, but all in all I like it alot. It came self packaged in a hard plastic case and it also has a slot for a mini SD card.3. The Tripod is great, I dont care for the mounting piece though, its plastic and feels Cheap, but it works great. I love it. I will be using this a lot.4. The package came with 2 UV filters, Love them, The moment i opened everything up I put the Filters right on, and they work great5. The Remote: I actually already have one of these, and although its great, im not really impressed by it. I have used it several times and its really not practical. You have to point it right at the camera, the only thing it can do is trigger to take the picture, it cant focus, or anything else for that matter, and it is hit and miss.6. SD card Holder, This is great, not to big, not to small, wish I had 2-3 more of these. It holds 8 SD chips, or 6 SD chips and it has 2 inserts to hold Mini SD chips. Great product, with I had more of them.7. The flash. Is a Cheap Manual, non-digital Flash. Its the difference between having a modern day cell phone and a Rotary Phone, and if you dont know what a Rotary phone is, its that phone that your great grand parents or grand parents had that you put your finger in each on of the numbers, turn the number back to zero, then move on to your next number to dial. LOL8. Battery: Great, always good to have these. works great no issues.9. Cleaning Kit: Always great to have, but its more of a filler product to make it seem like your getting alot.10. LCD protector sheets: again, great to have, filler product11. Camera Case. Way to small for my taste. It will hold everything in this kit, other then the Tripod of course, but nothing else. If you have other lenses, gear, flashes, etc. buy a new bag. you will need it.12. 64g Card. Awesome to have, wish the kit gave you 2 of these since the Camera holds 2 memory cards. they should change out the 64g card for 2 32g cards or add in a big perk and give 2 64g cards.Here is what you get but you dont see in this kit! The camera Comes with a Battery (so you will get 2 in the kit), a battery charger, 2 types of plug ins for the charger, a strap for the camera, a USB cable for transferring images from camera to computer (I dont recommend using this, because if there is a short in your computer, or the cable itself, it may blow your computer and your camera, since they give you the importer, use it.Overall great package, I do wish the package was a little better. i wish they would have 2 memory cards instead of 1, a grip should come with it, a better flash, and a better bag.All in all, great kit, you have a great start!", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good kit.  Camera works great", "Author": "WoodWiz", "ReviewID": "R2V87I3NHRXZS7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We just got back from Hawaii and the camera and pictures were awesome!  I took over 1000 pictures of whales, dolphins, zip lining, landscape, sunsets, fireworks. helicopter ride etc.  It worked great.The case is perfect and is actually made by Nikon (not some aftermarket garbage).  The off brand battery worked as good as the Nikon battery.  The Polarizing lens filters are good quality.  I've used both lenses with great success.  The SD card performed well.I have not used the external LED flash unit, tripod. lens cleaning kit or the remote control so I can't comment on them.The only problem I had is with the USB/SD card reader.  It quit working after a week.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Everything in one purchase", "Author": "split", "ReviewID": "R1SXVAKLCJITAZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I gave this a five star rating because the kit is perfect for someone wishing to move up to a semi professional set of photographic hardware. I purchased this for a friend in Croatia. He wanted a kit with all the accessories needed to get started right out of the box. This was a fantastic price when you start to add up the prices of the individual components. Everything was there as advertised. It arrived on time and the packaging to protect the shipment was best I have ever seen and I have ordered many electronic items from Amazon. I would highly recommend this vendor for photographic items.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Must buy for the serious up and coming Pro.", "Author": "Jacqueline L.

So far I like using it, even though it can be confusing at times. I am optimistic that I will get the \"hang\" of using a DSLR camera and eventually get the great pictures I want.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "GREAT camera!", "Author": "coucab", "ReviewID": "R2DIJBRQ81VEP9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am SO happy with this new camera and lenses!  I moved up from the D3100 (which is a perfectly fine entry level DSLR) but this D7100 is WORLDS apart!  I love the dual card slot, for one, and EVERYTHING is fingertip adjustable!  Love the 51 point focus system, too!  And, FYI, this kit DOES come with two batteries - one Nikon and one \"off\" brand.  There is a flash unit (not TTL) and UV filters for both lenses.  The tripod may work well for holding a smaller camera or a flash unit, but I wouldn't trust my D7100 on there - it's a little too lightweight for me!", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,699.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 15 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D7100 Digital SLR Camera Body + <2> Nikon 18-140mm VR DX AF-S Lens + <3> Nikon 55-300mm VR DX AF-S Lens +\n<4> Nikon Digital SLR Camera Case + <5> Transcend 64GB SDXC 10 Card + <6> Spare EN-EL15 Battery + <7> Precision Design DSLR300 Flash +\n<8> 58mm UV Filter + <9> 67mm UV Filter + <10> Precision Design ML-L3 Remote + <11> Precision Design 58\" Tripod +\n<12> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <13> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <14> PD 8 SD Card Memory Card Case + <15> LCD Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon D7100 Digital SLR Camera Body with 18-140mm & 55-300mm VR Lens + 64GB Card + Case + LED Flash + Battery + Tripod Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61%2BX8wZX3ZL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GGX3DLS"}}
