SQUAT!  Camera does not do anything.  You cannot tell if you have taken a picture or video.  It doesn't make a noise... you can hold button down on a cool  picture but doesn't take that image.  I think both have been tossed already.  Got a blue and pink one, for each kid.  They go digital picture frames so thought cool get them digital cameras.. not.. they get more out of the \"disposable\" ones... Just load them into the computer and pop the images onto their memory cards so they can view them on their digital picture frames..  do NOT waste your money.", "Date": "June 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Terrible company to deal with!", "Author": "C.

From the moment we opened the package, it did not work. I contacted the company by email several times and have never heard back from them. I couldn't ever find a phone number or any other way to contact them. Don't waste your money on this!", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000RO7GRE"}}
