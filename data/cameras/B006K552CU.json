The case is simple but nice (and can store an extra memory card) and the 4GB card saves some money.The camera itself has a tremendous amount of features, and takes very sharp pictures, even at extreme high zoom. The automatic setting is very clever, and makes smart decisions about lighting and flash--smarter than my 2-year-old Canon. Note: it's strange that a \"force-flash\" option is not allowed under full automatic mode, but hardly a deal-breaker as you can switch to partial-auto mode. The image stabilization is quite good.The main con is the pop-up flash, which is annoying because my fingers tend to want to grip the camera there. Even 5 millimeters to the right and would have been no problem, but I suppose it was a compactness issue. The flash is quite powerful for a consumer camera.Another silly issue is the included manual, which is horribly inadequate. Fortunately you can find a real manual online. The manual is needed because the camera has a lot of hidden complexity, especially if you want to use the top features.Still, all and all, I'm quite happy with the value for the money, and to get 16x zoom in such a compact form.", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product with some flaws", "Author": "HMelara", "ReviewID": "RJJMXXNPPZZ1V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Feb-2012I want to tell you somethings about this model:What I like the most- Resolution- Smart Mode very simple and useful for no tech people- Great movie resolution- Did I mention the amazing Zoom resolution?- All the characteristics are according to they said!What I dislike- Flash position, usually I put my left finger where the flash come out. It's a little bit annoying taking pictures using the flash. The publicity didn't mention where the flash is located, neither the specs. :S- Battery: I cannot take more than 15 flash photos. The flash run out the power very fast. (Nov. 2012: it seems that it only happens during the first discharge, after that you can take more photos using the flash, I would say 50 or 60).- Storage: Its SD Card cannot be read on a PC (Windows 7) It gives a message error, something like Couldn't read file format, and if I would like to format the SD Card. I have to use the camara to read the photos, and I need to use battery power, If the battery is discharged I cannot see the pictures.Nov-2012So far I had no problems with the camera! it has been a great investment!!!!Dic-2012No more SD Card problems.

I own the DSC H20 which takes some really great shots and pretty good videos.  In fact it was the video quality that sold me on both of these cameras.  What I don't like about either and maybe all Sony's are like this or maybe I just haven't figured out how to conquer this gremlin, the face recognition has to be reset to \"off\" every time I turn the camera back on.  When I'm taking pictures constantly of my grand children I don't want to have to worry about that.  I'm always forgetting and then can't take a picture because the camera is trying to focus on a face.  I would think I could set it to \"off\" and it would stay there like everything else I set to \"off\".  Other than that, this is a really great little camera!  The Zoom is a blast to use, the 16.1 mps make for some very crisp photos and as I've said, I love the video quality.

I shoot with a Sony Alpha DLSR so I like to think I have down the basics for focusing an auto-focus camera, and I had a very difficult time getting anything properly in focus.

Simply incredible pictures. I read in other reviews about the flash pooing on the left side where the index finger tends to be which can be a little weird at first but in a week you get use to move your finger 10 mm back or front.

I've used their products for decades. Typically I always found them to be the highest quality, last forever and really enjoyed them. From the Walkman, to the Discman to Sony TVs, DVD players, Video cameras, and of course cameras.My last 3 Sony Cybershot cameras I've purchased have ALL had problems with them. 2 of them had the same exact problem and Sony did cover them under the 1 year warranty. Fortunately they all happened within the 1 year warranty.When I pressed a manager he admitted there were some motherboard problems at the factory in Japan and they were working on it. So I was on my 3rd camera (DSCH90/B) and I only bought it a few months ago. It too had problems. It would often times say \"reindexing\" and take forever to load every time I turned it on. Also, sometimes it would just be black and not turn on. (same type of problems with the other 2 Cybershots I sent in).I just sent it to the service center (as the previous 2 times) to the Laredo, Texas repair center and I get an email saying that I needed to pay $270 plus tax for the repair. Keep in mind I only paid $250 for the camera brand new!I immediately called in and they told me to disregard the email and someone would email me. Rather than wait, I emailed the manager that was so helpful the previous 2 times on the broken cybershots. He told me that there was \"corrosion\" and they couldn't cover it under warranty. HUH??I've never done anything at all that isn't normal. I've always used the original battery and we have always kept the camera indoors, never exposed to harsh weather conditions, temperatures, etc. I complained and the manager said the best they can do is send a new one for $125.06 plus tax. I guess I'll be forced to accept it but honestly I don't think this is fair as the camera is only a few months old. I see on Amazon it's only $137 plus tax now so it's not even like they are offering some great deal.When I go to replace these, I probably won't buy another Sony Cybershot since they won't even honor their 1 year warranty and make claims of \"corrosion damage\".", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm not happy with this camera.", "Author": "James C.

I purchased the red.  Very attractive look...darker crimson red, not bright red.  I love the help screen feature where you can press the question mark when on a specific feature and it will give details.  Lots of features including blink detection. Rechargeable battery is also a plus.Cons:  The flash location is absolutely irritating.  It may be worse for me though because I'm left-handed.  When I take pics it pops up exactly where I am holding the camera.  I am afraid it's going to cause me to drop it.  The zoom feature is really neat but the part where you move it is on the front of the camera and not the back.  It's kind of difficult to zoom.  Verryyyy slow to save and then immediately view pictures.  I'm also concerned about the tiny lever that holds the battery in. It looks like its about to break when I try to put the battery in.  Removing the battery is unavoidable because you have to charge it.Overall:  Overall I like the picture quality better than my last cyber shot.  I would purchase again.  Maybe in time I will get used to some of the cons. Most of the functions were the same as my last cyber shot which makes it easier to maneuver around the menu of features on the screen.

Meaning, if you're at a NASCAR event, you only get one shot of the cars going by.  The photo processing to the memory card is frustratingly slow. (1 image per second is what it \"cranks\" out.)You can turn off the flash, but you cannot force the flash to fire (in Automatic mode.  But you can in \"P\" mode).  I'm very dependent on fill light from the flash, so this pi**ed me off.It's pretty compact and you will need to train yourself to not have your finger sitting over the pop-up flash.It's slow to crank up, so not great for quickie pics.  (Slower than I'm accustomed to)There's no infinity setting.But wow, the zoom feature and the amount of incredible levels of detail at super zoom is breath taking!So it's a LOVE/sort of hate relationship, like dog training.You may love dogs, and trying to train one to be \"perfect\" can drive you insane with frustration.

The full list of all the thought I have come up with on the primary points will be listed in the next section and wrapped up with an overview. This is from the perspective of a former Professional Photographer so it may go over some people's heads. Read it till the end if possible.Packaging:I purchased this camera used so I cannot give a review on the packaging.Positive:Price is king and this camera not only works but has features I wouldn't expect of something in this price range.Resolution is great.Lens goes to f/3.3 (remember the price).Manual modeSupport for Memory Stick Pro-Duo and SDSolid buildIt's a Sony!Negative:One Frame Per Second, probably due to cheap buffer memoryManual controls are clunkyNo RAWNeutral:Charger is white?Impressions:For a budget, current generation, camera I don't think the H90 can be beat. Simple as that. The initial introduction price at $250 was far to expensive but now that it's fallen to $150, that is more than fair for this piece of technology. I will be comparing this to the Canon S105 which is not fair to do, but I just want to put the differences between being able to buy two of these for the price of one S105. If I use terminology that is unfamiliar, please Google the term so I don't make this review too much of a study guide. The S105 has an f/2.0 lens compared to the H90 which is f/3.3, at minimum zoom, and both increase to f/5.9 at maximum zoom which is x5 for the S105 and x16 for the H90. This means the S105 is much better at low light than the H90. I don't personally use zoom but if you do like zoom, then the H90 has a the upper hand. I have not personally pixel peeped the comparison of the lenses of both cameras but I'd bet pretty good money that the S105 has much better clarity and consistency than the H90. The S105 also shoots in RAW, a file type that stores the image in a form that is more readily edited on the computer. The S105 also has 1080P while the H90 only has 720P. But the H90 shoots at 16.1MP resolution compared to the 12.1MP on the S105.I've blown up the review above with technical terms to make a clear distinction. If you as a consumer, didn't understand what I was talking about, just buy the H90 and use the extra money on a good tripod, case, and extra SD cards (always have 2 or 3, always, they do break... Or get lost... Or forgotten). If you're the inquisitive type and start to do research about what I talked about then you may choose to go with the S105. If you have oodles of money and just want the best point and shoot, get the S105. But no matter what, realize that in a camera, megapixels are not everything. Light is passing through a piece of glass and hitting \"film\" that is the same size on both these cameras and  getting a camera with more MP does not automatically mean a better picture. The H90 is meant to be a cheap camera that has some great features for people who don't want or need the best.Conclusion:I've gotten many compliments about my photos with this camera, no one knows it's a point-and-shoot, it is very good for the price. If you don't use the pictures from this camera to print 8x10s, no one will be able to tell the difference between a picture from this or the S105 or even a multiple thousand dollar camera in most cases (not including low-light, no flash). There is a National Geographic *cover* from the early 2000s that was shot are around 4-6MP.

I've had few problems with them, so each has been a slightly better model based on my needs and budget.  For this DSC-H90, I was looking for a substantial optical zoom and decent image quality, for under $150.  It may sound stupid, but I also wanted a more \"DSLR look,\" rather than just a pocket point-and-shoot.  But finding a camera, without regard to brands, with these specifications in my price range with a rechargeable battery, NOT AA's, proved difficult.  But this camera has it!  The zoom is definitely worth it for the price.  With such high megapixels, I can crop a photo down some and not have to worry about image fuzziness.My Pros:- The price!  I was able to grab this for only $134 on Amazon with free shipping, while every other site and store had it for $148+.  A good price leaves more to spend on a good memory card and other accessories.- It shipped in only 3 days (excluding New Years Day), and for free with super saver shipping.- The zoom and image quality - impressive for under $150 and still can fit into a larger pocket.The Cons:- The battery cover of the camera and especially the lens cover are made of cheap plastic.  The lens cover doesn't even fit together quite right because the pieces are set in so loosely - concerning since the glass lens is so important!- The place where the flash pops up.  Definitely not the end of the world, but as many other reviews say, oh so annoying because a place for your finger is nice.- The camera box was not well-shipped.  It is a quite small box, but came shipped inside of a box about eight times its volume with not enough air pillows, allowing the camera box to slide around inside.And in case you're wondering what all you get with this camera (I was concerned but bought it anyway...), here's what the camera box comes with:CameraHand strap to attach to cameraUSB to camera cordrechargeable  battery in plastic caseoutlet chargermanualsThe only two things missing that most people will need are a carrying bag and a memory card.

Takes amazing pictures and has a wide variety of settings to optimize your picture. Most important thing to note is that pictures turn out great if there in no movement. Even in low light, if there in no movement and you are able to keep the camera still with a tripod you will get great 16MP pictures. If there is movement, there will be motion blur unless you are out in full sunlight. Still there are times where you will get motion blur. Another thing that is great about this camera in you can take continuous shots at the rate of about 2FPS. This is enough to get sweeping panoramas and also capture moving subjects in full sunlight. So this camera is great for landscape or portrait shots but for moving subjects and in low light this camera lacks and requires some tinkering with exposure, aperture and brightness. Video is captured at 720p at 30FPS, which for me is perfect quality for my computer and TV's resolution. Video mode in very smooth in all aspects. Optical stabilization works well and prevents shakiness of the camera. While panning the brightness adjusts quickly. When zooming the focus adjusts quickly but not quickly enough that you cant tell when watching the video. Overall I am very impressed with the video this camera is able to take especially because it is really meant for pictures. The camera's battery life is good and lasts about 3 hours of continuous use. When I was on vacation in Yosemite National Park one battery would last me the entire day and I took pictures constantly provided I power the camera off when not in use. One last all important point is that this camera is durable. Very solid with a metal face plate and zoom. I dropped this camera down a granite slope and it bounced down 15 feet in front of me to hit a stone wall. The only damage to the camera was cosmetic with a small crack in the side. Everything still works and all buttons have the same functionality. Great camera for a beginner and through my research it is the forth best cameras in its price range.

Personally, I'm lazy, would rather let the camera do all the work. It will adjust to pretty much any scene, and also has some advanced White-balance features that are great when you need to adjust for the lighting your working in. It takes a little while to learn all the features and understand what each one does, and how to use it.

The battery lift isn't that great if you are taking lots of pictures like I do. 3. Don't like the fact that you can't charge the rechargeable battery with the usb. You have to remove the battery and insert it into the wall charger. 4. The usb plug is on the bottom of the camera so you have to lay it down to plug it in. 5. does not have internal memory you have to purchase a seperate SD card..Overall for the price of $70 it is a good little camera and takes great looking pictures..It is a good first camera but compaired to my Kodak I would have to pick the Kodak.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "This camera has not good picture quality", "Author": "hari pandey", "ReviewID": "R1AFYF2T989N6J", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera is not that much good, I did not found that much good what I expected.

I shot some video but no more, to download it you have to install the included PlayMemories software which grabbed all of My Pictures files.  Had I not backed up regularly I would have lost all of those files,  I strongly recommend not using that software, if you need to shoot video get another brand camera.  This is my fifth Sony, I had no trouble with the other four, why they changed I'll never know but this will be my last!  The other four are still in use, W80, (2) W120 and an DSC F 828.  The processing time takes way too long and you can miss shots. This P&S; was to replace an older (but working fine) one, as carrying one of my DSLRs is out of the question.
