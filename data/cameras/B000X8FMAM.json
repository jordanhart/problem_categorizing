{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Value.  Exceeded Expectations!", "Author": "C. Rose", "ReviewID": "R1J6TRJZ5QYSUT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was hesitant to buy this system instead of a complete setup with DVR due to compatibility/driver issues, but I was pleasantly suprised. The instructions in the setup software were a little unclear at times, but the user manual filled in any gaps along the way. I was also impressed to find that the features of the program for recording, motion sensor, network connectivity, etc. were powerful and easy to navigate.I would recommend this unit to anyone who wants to use their PC and save the cost of adding a new DVR. In fact, I was able to buy a new PC with 500G storage for less than a DVR with the same size hard drive!I only wish the cameras had a smoked glass cover so nobody could tell which direction the lens is pointed. These have a plastic cover with a clear slit through which the lens looks. That said, they do a great job and the motion detection is helpful for recording and monitoring.", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,999.95", "Features": "Monitoring Supports up to 16 Cameras ( Additional hardware required) ,1, 4, 7, 9, 13, 16 screen split selection\nAverage files size under medium compression rate: 2~4KB (320X240); Independent event setup for each camera\nAudio 1 Channel Audio Input, Two-way audio communication; Replay and search easy of use search function\nRemote control using network Remote replay; record and control via LAN, ADSL, PSTN, ISD\nSelf-checking & recovery Watch-Dog function, Log file; free 1 larger surveillance warning sticker", "Name": "VideoSecu 8 Channel PCI DVR Video Capture Card CCTV Surveillance including 8 x CCD Security Cameras and Power Supplies, Extension Cables 1G1", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K4ygIcfvL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000X8FMAM"}}
