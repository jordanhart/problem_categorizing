{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This Is actually a upgrade from my D5100, annd My D90 in many aspects !!", "Author": "joshua fortini", "ReviewID": "R2T9WB50WZ7ZP4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have Been a hobby photographer for the last 25 years and a professional for the last 3 years, and the D3100 has a great array of all of the professional (options) to fine tune the perfect shot with Active D-Lighting (d=dynamic) it literally shoots with active d lighting or can be edited with D-Lighting in the camera pre transfer. Also this camera has an auto, and auto guide mode for beginners to help an amatuer work their way to learning how to use all of those fancy ( P, S, A, M ) modes and how to use them Highly reccomended for the beginer that wants to get more than just a point and shoot, with the ability to be also just a point and shoot and MUCH MUCH more, as a avid NIKON shooter I have more experience with Nikons than most I also carry a coolpix s6000 around to light test. My only Must have with a D3100 is a SDHC memory card with a rating of 8-10 for the 1080 HD video and a tripod. and when using the camera for video leave it on the tripod !! if in video mode it can have a wabbly look if it is panned to fast or moved a bit too quickly !! a tripod is the 1 of 2 must haves #2 again a SDHC memory card with a 8-10 rating (the rating on a memory card is a small # in a circle) it has nothing to do with size. It affects how quickly information can be written on the card !!", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great camera for DSLR beginners", "Author": "erik b. prestbury", "ReviewID": "R1U2ISG2UG3K6U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is very effective. Photos are razor sharp and crystal clear, and the guide mode is perfect for beginner to intermediate photographers.

Initially I used the automatic settings a lot which produces a very nice photo, but I took a very quick course (2 hrs) from a local photographer and I'm able to take VERY good photos now. I still use my iPhone5 for the quick stuff and for video, but for high quality pictures this is my go-to. It's very easy to use once you get a good idea about what you're doing with it. The red color is very pretty too.I liked that this offered a video option but at this point I have yet to capture a decent video on it... I recently messed with some settings so it might be better now, but I haven't checked. Prior to changing settings, my iPhone took better video. Note that the factory settings aren't really as good as what you can set it up as with a little photography knowledge so it's worth taking a course ASAP so you can improve your photo quality.I ended up purchasing this refurbished off a vendor on Ebay for a slightly lower price, but Amazon had the lowest price otherwise.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Looks great, fits perfectly into handbag", "Author": "Nureen Hanisah Mohamad Zaki", "ReviewID": "R32HEY3IDKWL2M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Perfect DSLR for starters or just to get nice pictures!

I am not a professional photographer nor am I a beginner. That said let me say this camera makes me feel like a pro. The shots are crisp, clear and true to color. I am still learning all the different functions so I will have to return to update after I learn more about my new camera. I would recomend this camera to all who want to learn how to take beautiful pictures. If it's just a point and shoot you want, well this one is good for that but it would be a shame not to learn how to take advantage of all it's feature. So I say buy and learn. You will love the pictures you can capture with this camera. The body is easy to hold and the lenses go on and off with ease.  So get yourself this camera and head out to grab some great shots!!", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love my Nikon", "Author": "Kerry Wagner", "ReviewID": "R2B01986BVC7I5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes awesome pictures.
