{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An absolutely incredible little camera", "Author": "Mack Lee Sullivan", "ReviewID": "R6D82XBVAJLU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the S330 3 days before leaving for Moscow & St. Petersburg. Based on reviews read here and at other sites I also bought a 256MB memory card and an extra battery. The basics of operation took about 20 minutes and 15-20 photos of the backyard, by the second day of my trip operation was effortless. The zoom is quite impressive and most pictures were flawless; whether from a boat, through glass, from a moving car, whatever, even an amateur like myself got some truly special photos. I had a 128MB card from another camera and took it with me, a bonus, the memory cards aren't specific to the camera and you can get real cheap memory on-line from secondary distributers or borrow the cards from freinds with other digital cameras. The batteries charge very quickly, and with two I was able to leave one charging at the hotel and the other in the camera, but I could've easily carried both all day - full charge takes less than an hour. I never had any power problems, I also got in the habit of turning the camera off between shots however. Which brings me to my only real complaint, the on/off switch requires sustained pressure for 2-4 seconds, its not usually problem getting the shot you want but it could be - and it was a little annoying. Since I had so much memory I used 1600x1200 and the finest detail for every shot, and I still took over 350 photos and had room for about 75 more. Now that I'm home its giving me all kinds of options for re-sizing and zooming into whatever details I like most in the picture. The picture review setting on this camera is one of its best features, you can actually zoom into the photo you just took to be sure you've got the level of detail or particular aspect of a subject that you might've wanted. I ended-up retaking several photos and getting precisely the picture I was hoping for. I own an older Sony and one of the original Kodaks, and I can't recommend this camera enough.

It has the following positives,1. Excellent looks, build quality.2. Great night shots, not found on any other compact 250gms camera, new long shutter feature in manual mode for upto 15 secs.3. Very reliable and tons of features like charger works all over the worls, PAL/NTSC video out, all cables included (unlike Sony).4. Accepts cheaper Compact Flash cards which are easily available in sizes upto 256MB. Not expensive 64MB sticks here :)5. Very much pocketable. Easily goes into the trouser pockets. Slightly tough to fit into jeans pocket though. Look at S200 if you want even smaller camera.6. 2.1 MP may looks low compared to other 3/4 MP cameras but this one offers more features without sticking you with any sticks ! Don't just use MPixels as your sole criteria when selecting camera. If you won't print them bigger than 8x10\" then 2MP should be enough for now unless you have that extra cash :)7. 3x zoom very faster to start and fold back. Works smoothly. You can turn the digital zoom off permanently.8  LCD is superb, pictures look great on the 1.5\" LCD. (a bigger 1.8\" LCD on other need not neccessarily mean better quality, my last years Fuji had 1.8\" and comes no where near this 1.5\")9. Great user interface... think of these Elph's as Nokia's of digicams. Other cheaper camera's out there might not have same reliability, features, user interface and picture quality.Problems,1. Battery... lasts on 120 shots or so...  you WILL have to buy a second one for extra [money].2. The battery/CF doors feel flimsy. There are not made of metal but of plastic which looks like silver colored metal. But this much better than an all plastic one !3. Canon's ZoomBrowser EX software is very unstable. It keeps crashing every few mins on Windows XP. Canon needs to iron out the problems in this. After buying an expensive camera atleast its SW should be reliable ! (Atlhough I haven't encountered any problems downloading pics till now, I don't see any reason to buy a CF card reader, this works fine with the cable, took just 3 mins for 100 big pictures)4. Price is still high for a 2MP camera, although its become much more affordable than last year.5. Movie mode is almost useless because of 5 sec limit on decent sized clip. Its just a marketing thing. Same with the audio/mic on camera.6. Included CF card is just 8MB ! (it costs [money] to get a 32MB card for bulk purchases). Someone has to start including these necessary things like a decent 64MB card along with new cameras.Spend few extra bucks on this cool camera and you won't regret !", "Date": "May 5, 2002"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Digital P&S; Camera", "Author": "A Customer", "ReviewID": "R12ZCTKTETD684", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Cannon PowerShot S330 is my first digital camera. I had it for about six weeks so far and I just love it. As a result of getting this camera, in the past six weeks I've taken more pictures at family events then probably the last 6 years combined using conventional cameras. To me, the best thing about digital photography is the instant feedback. You can see your picture as soon as you take it. And if you don't mind wasting some battery, you can use the LCD screen to frame your shots so every picture comes out exactly the way you like it. And downloading the pictures also makes things easy. Basic FeaturesThe camera is capable of 2.0-mega pixel resolutions and it has a 3x optical zoom lens and 2.5 digital zoom. The camera is small, I would say a little bigger then a cigarette box and fits in your hands or pickets easily. Both the front and the back of the camera are finished in metal so it weights a little more then other cameras but not to the point where it is heavy to carry. The S330 also comes with a very bright 2.5\" LCD screen in the back. Even in direct sunlight you should still have no problem seeing the screen. With the LCD screen on all the time, I estimate that you should be able to get about 100 to 150 pictures depending how much flash you use. The S330 doesn't come with an AC adapter kit so when you need to recharge, you have to take out the battery and put it in the special battery charger that plugs directly to the wall jack. I thought this was kind of awkward but has since gotten use to it. Advance FeaturesThe PowerShot S330 is very easy to use as a point-and-shoot camera but it also has a number of advance features like shutter speed and ISO settings if you need it. It also has a number of white balance controls which helps compensate the different lighting conditions such as fluorescent, cloudy and etc. I've tried to use this features a couple of times but haven't quite master it. I would imagine that most people would never need this feature but if you are a tweaker, there should be enough options in this camera to keep you satisfied. Besides the regular camera like features, it also has a movie mode and stitch assist mode that are interesting. The stitch assist mode is for panoramic shots and it's best to do this with a tripod so at the points where the pictures are stitched together, the object wouldn't look warped. The camera does not stitch the pictures, that process is done separately when you connect the camera to the computer. The stitched pictures will have a stitch line linking them together indicating that these pictures were shot in stitch mode. Clicking on the stitch line would launch the software program to for the panoramic picture. And you can stitch as many pictures together as you want. The movie mode is something I've only used a couple of time. The camera stores short film clips and it limits how long you can shoot depending on the resolution of the film. The clips are limited from 10 to 30 seconds and in 640x480 resolution (which is the largest), it would only record for 10 seconds and not 30. PicturesIn terms of the quality of the picture, I am pretty satisfied with it. Sometimes the picture is a little soft around the edges or kind of fuzzy but that's not every single time. The color of the photo is decent but IMHO, not 100% true to life. There are quit a few pictures I've taken the found it to be too red or yellow. But most outdoor shots in daylight that looks just wonderful. The flashlight packs a big punch for something so small. Anything within 8 feet is no problem at all in dark situations. The focus light has a slightly shorter effective distance so sometimes the camera can't focus so when you push the shutter and nothing happens. This is kind of frustrating but just try to take a few steps closer to your subject and it should be fine. Just about every picture I take with this camera, I take it in 1600x1400 resolution and in fine mode. This way, any pictures that I like I can have it developed and look just like it was taken from a conventional camera. In this largest format, the photo is about 1MB each. So with a 128MB compact flash card, you can still store plenty of pictures. Unfortunately, Canon only provides a 8MB CF card with the camera so make sure you buy a CF card if you don't already have it. Also, because of S330's small size, it is only capable of accepting Type I CF cards and not Type II. So like IBM's 1 GB MicroDrive is not compatible with this camera. IssuesMaybe I've missed this in the user's manual but I have yet to find a battery meter that shows me how much juice is left in the battery. When the power is running low, the camera would just shut down with very little warning. I guess Canon just didn't think this is a critical issue since the pictures are all already saved in the memory so advance warnings on the battery running low is pretty useless. But just be prepared and the best solution is to have a second battery so you can just switch it when one runs out. For such a well build camera it's very disappointing to see the cheesy flap it uses to cover the USB and video ports on the side of the camera. Not a major issue though. Canon did not include any bag or pouch for the storage of this camera. Even though the camera is small enough to fit just about anywhere, the metal finishing is brushed and can be easily scratched. A soft pouch would be perfect to protect the surface but not included so protect your investment and get one on your own. I am not going to complain about the 2-mega-pixel limit because it's more then enough for an average user. A well taken 2-mega-pix pictures developed on 4x6 film would look no different than if it's taken on a 35mm camera. So don't buy more then you need because the higher the resolution, the more memory it needs and more time it takes to save a picture. So take a closer look at the Canon PowerShot S330 because it might be just what you're looking for....", "Date": "December 10, 2002"}, {"Title": "Lightweight Portable Killer", "Author": "Joseph M.

Including Olympus, Sony and Kodak.  None of them offered the portability and durabilty and yet maintained the picture quality I needed.  When I saw the s330, I finally realized what I had been searching for... Great picture quality, digital/zoom, extremely portable and durable.  Not to mention 2 megapix is way more than enough unless your thinking of starting a professional photo career.  The pictures come out spotless everytime... Just shoot and put it back in your pocket.  Another great feature is the battery charger... completely foldable in one piece.  No cord involved, just plug directly into the wall.  This is the ultimate travel package!

My first camera was the s300 and I thought that I was never going to get another one as good, but the s330 excelled all my expectations. It is cheaper than the s300 and have more features and a better ISO, a problem that really frustrated me in the past with my S300. Overall both of them have the same specs but the additional speaker and the better menu made the s330 #1 in my list. Please remember that this is not a pro camera, but the photo quality is outstanding even at large formats like 8x11. The colors are better than the sony and olympus. I do recomend an extra battery if traveling and a way larger flash card. Newegg.com sell mr. flash 128mb for less than 60 bucks. I have bought 2 and have them for over 6 months and never had a problem with them. I did a lot of research before purchasing this camera and let me assure that this is the best digital camera for every day and even semi pro users. There is no need to follow the crazy trend of the more mega pixels the better. 2.1 is more than enough. I get the same or even better results than normal film.

At first glance [it] seemed a lot to spend on a 2 megapixel digital camera but being my first digital purchase I decided to try it out.At first i just took pictures using the automatic function figuring that the manual controls would be too dificult but within the first day I was shooting pictures in manual mode, adjusting white balance and lighting and such, and printing them. I was very surprised by the quality that my two year old inkjet print the pictures at (as long as you don't look too close or print them over 8x10 which your not supposed to do anyways) on glossy photo paper. I was also concerned because indoor shots came out very dark but I soon realized that the brightness could be adjusted with the included software which was very basic yet helpful. The movie quality is low but that's not what a camera is for so it's a nice little extra. Overall I have had no problems with the camera and I am very pleased with my purchase. This would be an excellent camera for anyone looking for an easy camera for a novice with some advanced functions.

Personally, I like tiny little cameras that I can carry around evey day and Canon Digital ELPH is the best for this function. Since there had been so many reviews, let me just point out what I like this camera most and some of the downsides.Pro1. 3X optical zoom. DON'T purchase a camera with an optical zoom less than 3X, it's useless. This is one of the camera with the highest optical zoom availble. Not even the new ELPH 230 have this capability.2. Very bright LCD and long battery life. I have tried at least 10 different digital cameras and this LCD is one of the brightest. Easily seem even under sunlight. And I can fill up my 128MB card withought recharging with normal LCD usage.3. All metal!4. Great manual functions for a small camera. I can easily take night and indoor pictures by increasing the exposure time. Con1. the macro mode is limited compare to other camera in the same price range. You cannot to close to the object.2. comes with 8MB card!! Can you believe that?!3. only 2MP. It is plenty for my need but 3MP seems to become the main stream these days.All in all, I have taking a few hundred pictures with my S330 and the quality is excellent.

After months of research and deciding on buying a Canon S300, I was pleased to discover that they had released an updated model, the S330.  Its resolution is 0.1 megapixle lower than the S300, but it includes many refined features.I've used the camera for a little over a week now and have taken nearly 500 pictures and am still on my second battery charge (about 2/3 of the pictures I've taken have been with the LCD off).  The included 8 MB compact flash card limits the number of hi-res, hi-quality pics you can take, but you can buy a 128 MB card for a little over 50 bucks (I recommend one from SimpleTech) and be able to hold from 128 to over 1000 pictures, depending on resolution & quality.The camera has lots of options and is especially versatile in its \"manual\" mode where you have a little more control than you do in the full auto mode.  It gives you freedom to lock the AE, focus and other settings, as well as apply special effects/enhancements.  I leave the camera in manual mode most of the time, since it retains its point-and-shoot simplicity; that way there's one less step to take (turning the selector dial) when I want to change how the camera's taking pictures.It also has a video mode and photostitch mode.  In the photostitch mode the camera helps you line up multiple shots so you can merge them into a single panoramic shot using software on your PC (included).If you're considering this camera but fear it may be too small to easily hold, don't worry.  I have larger than average hands and have no problems at all with manipulating the buttons and taking pictures (although, as with all things, it takes some practice).Enough rambling, the bottom line is....This is definitely the BEST 2 MP, 3 x zoom, compact digital camera available at this time.", "Date": "April 16, 2002"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera!", "Author": "Christian", "ReviewID": "R3FFY2N3GCWX43", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would like to rate this camera with 5 stars, but there are a few features that I miss. 1)No battery status.

Camera does not come with a case of any kind. I would like to protect the nice finish on the camera.3)Problems to transfer the MPEG (the less than 30 second movies) to the computer. The MPEG movies did not automatically transfer to the computer with the rest of the images, not sure if you have to change the settings to do so??4)No power cord. The camera does not come with a power cord, so you constantly have to run the camera on batteries, even when you have it hooked up to the computer.However, I did a lot of research before buying this camera.

The battery included in the S330 has 30% more capacity then the previous models in the powershot series.

Was able to unpack and start shooting pictures right out of the box without using the manual (and I'm not even an engineer!).  Pics at a butterfly festival came out unbelieveable, and inside shots have been excellent.  Wonderful people shots with excellent skin tones.  So far I've only used \"auto\", and haven't tried the \"movie\" mode yet, but am looking forward to trying out all the bells and whistles.  I bought an extra NB-1LH battery, a Card reader (which is a must, in my book), and a 128 card.

I was on the point of buying the G2, until I read so many reviews about the camera freezing up -- decided not to take the risk.  I do wish this was 3 megapixels, as the name sort of implies, and that it had a higher optical zoom -- but I can't cut my rating for those options as I knew what was offered when I bought the camera.  The Zoom Browser software has worked well, tho I have hardly had to touch any of the editing features as the colors have been wonderful.  I'm very happy with this camera and highly recommend it.

It was not, however, a perfect camera, and the S300 attempted to address its major shortcomings. First of all, the  zoom jumped to 3:1 rather than the old 2:1, yielding a big improvement in utility. The S300 also added a 30 second movie function, which once you mastered the download process, really added zip to Internet photo apps. Lastly, the control wheel with embedded power switch worked far better than the old recessed power button, which in my mind was a real problem with the S100. Now, the new S330 updates the S300 with better battery management and higher amperage, and adds several new user controls. It does *not* add the anticipated 3 megapixel resolution, nor improve upon the optical zoom. The question now is whether the digital Elph series is worth the premium one pays for its compactness. For considerably less money, one can buy other digicams that are only modestly larger but rather better equipped.

Picture quality is without equal among similarly priced 2 to 4 megapixel cameras.Don't fret about it only having 2 megapixels - when's the last time you had anything enlarged beyond an 8x10, anyway (never, right?).  2 megapixels will give you fantastic results, will allow you to take subsequent shots quicker, will let you store more photos on your compact flash card, and cost less than the 3+ megapixel cameras.  For 99% of you, worrying about 2 megapixels not being enough is kind of like worrying your car's top speed - you'll never take your car that fast, and with the camera, you'll never notice the difference between 2 megapixels and 3 or 4 megapixels.The most important things to me are picture quality and portability - you cannot take great pictures if your camera is left at home.

Levine", "ReviewID": "R8F40LQQNMOU7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was my first digital, and a wonderful introduction to the world of digital photography.  I'm sure I've taken more than 10,000 pictures sinceI got my S330 last spring, and I've recommended it to three friends who have bought the same camera.  I routinely put my travel photographs on line, and the reviews have been very positive.  The camera has proven to be durable and reliable, and I'm totally hooked on digital photography.  I kept my old point-and-shoot film camera for the first few months after I went digital, but have since given it away and never missed it.  It's all digital, all the time for me.On the plus size, the camera is very compact (easily fits into a pocket), easy to use, and takes good quality pictures.  It also has a very wide range of manual adjustments to increase the flexibility of your picture-taking, and the controls are very well thought out.  The LCD display is very high quality, bright and sharp.  I carry it with me everywhere, and wind up taking many pictures I would have missed with a larger camera.There are some quirks and weaknesses I do need to point out for this camera.  Color reproduction is uneven, depending on the quality of the light and weather, and on the color and type of subject.  Many of my outdoor photos, particularly those taken on overcast or cloudy days, have a noticeable \"cast\" to them ... bluish or greenish.  This is despite fiddling with the manual settings for \"overcast.\"  The camera loves red (you should see my pictures of the barns of coastal Maine) but hates green.  I have never been able to take a picture of a lawn or tree that is anything near true to life, again despite attempts to adjust the manual settings.  On bright days, again despite working with the manual settings, highlights are inevitably blown out (although I hear this is a problem with most digital camera).  In addition, the flash is no more than could be expected from a compact camera.  Flash pictures always look ... well ... flashy!When taking digital photographs, you'll tend to take many more pictures than you would with a film camera, and erase the ones you don't like in the camera.  So I'd recommend at least one additional battery (I have two) and 256 MB memory card if you're going to be doing travel photography without access to a computer to download the photos as you go.  (I get about 360 pictures at highest resolution from a 256 MB card,)  More tips:  digital photography is MUCH easier if you have a Mac (it really is as easy as they claim in their ads to download and edit pictures); Adobe's Photoshop Elements 2.0 is incredible (and an incredible bargain), and Shutterfly.com is a great site for ordering prints.I've got my eye on a 5 Megapixel 8x zoom for early next year, but I'll keep my S330 for its compact size and ease of use.", "Date": "December 15, 2002"}, {"Title": "I couldn't be any more impressed...", "Author": "\"bookman1216\"", "ReviewID": "R2H1CKS25E2JW7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "with this camera or its abilities.

The automatic camera settings are very realistic, and the advanced (manual) settings are much more numerous than similar cameras in this price range/megapixels.  Manual settings don't take very long to learn, and give the user just enought freedom so as not to totally blow any important shots you may be taking.  The LCD is bright and clear, and the function buttons and menus are very easily navigated.  If you do however have to look in the owner's manual for some guidance, Canon leads the way as far as simplicity and explainations go. All the descriptions are accompanied by photos representing what buttons the user is to press to reach the desired result.For me, the most impressive part of this package are the solid construction of the camera body (all metal and easily gripped with one hand,)and the advanced editing software that accompanies the imageviewing software for your computer.

A battery meter would help a lot..I do suggest getting a second battery if you plan to use it for long periods of time.This camera may not be the best for everyone, but for someone who needs nice quality pictures (but not the best), in a nice looking, easily caried form, this works great.I have never seen another camera that looks and feels so nice.

One of my friends has a PowerShot from last year and like the repositioning of the buttons on the S330.  It feels like a 35 mm camera without the film.  For quality, manual control, and lens selection, nothing beats an SLR.  For your everyday shooting (including quick videos), this is a great camera.  Every review I read for this camera was excellent ).  The only thing I wish it had was a 3.1 megapixel resolution and a bigger card (I would recommend the 128 MB).

Not only does it take unbelievable pictures, but there are so many options. I recently took it on a trip to some glacier caves in New Hampshire and shot some great photos. Neat part is, there's a sound feature that lets you record about 30 seconds of sound and attach to each photo. So you can really explain just what each photo is and save it as a .wav file. There's also a movie feature that lets you record about 30 seconds of moving action with sound. What's really amazing to me is the quality of pictures in a completely dark room.

I say this is a great camera at a great price. Sure there are other 2mp cameras that are a little cheaper but after using this one and its predecessor the S300, the others don't compare in overall ease of use, speed of use and quality of construction.Although this camera can still give you better results with a little tweaking, the automatic settings are better than almost all others in this price range. And of course this is one of the most Pocketable cameras out there. Don't get me wrong there are some very cool manual features on this great little camera. My favorite is the slow shutter control. You can set the shutter to several speeds from 1 second to 15 seconds. And the camera comes with built in processing to eliminate hot pixels (those bright spots that appear on most long exposure digital pics). I have used this several times always with good results.Overall there is little to complain about with this package. It comes with a good battery for general use, good software, all the cabling you need to get going and even a fairly well written manual. If you are planning on using this on long trips where you will not have access to an electrical outlet very often, then you will want to get the extra battery. And I highly recomend the Canon PSC-300 Case, it is perfectly sized for this camera and still has room for extra memory and battery.Do yourself a favor and get a Viking 128MB compact flash card.

Automatic and manual controls allow for photography in most lighting situations.  The camera even can record short digital videos including sound, and the camera's user interface is customizable with new sound \"themes\" and a start-up image.Highly recommended accessories include a larger compact flash memory card or two; the 8-mb card included simply doesn't cut it unless you want to only take low-res pictures.

The media is easy to swap out with the PC or you can connect it directly to your PC with an optional PCMCIA adaptor.  You can also do a slide show on your PC or TV.  It comes with all the cables.  The camera is rugged and well built.  I like the stainless steel case and it has both a LCD and viewfinder for framing your subject.  The maual mode allows for some control of flash and exposure, but you have to learn the menus.  It's basically point and shoot. The flash, red eye reduction and self timer works well.  Autofocus is accurate, but sometimes has to think about it awhile before shoooting depending on subject and background. The battery life is excellent, but recharging takes some time.  Among the drawbacks:There are a lot of menu choices that you need to learn if you want to get really fancy with all of the modes.  Navigation is fairly simple, but you have a lot of choices. The AVI \"best\" mode will only do a few seconds of AVI at a time.  This isn't very clear by just reading the manual. Don't expect to shoot family videos though.  Just short snippets with audio.

It is an excellent 2MP camera! Minolta had an ultraslim 2MP, but avid digital camera viewers have said that the shape does not compensate for the poor image quality. As I have come across other 2MP contendors, the ELPH shape is by far the best. Shortly after I bought the camera, Konica came out with a slightly smaller 3.34MP (Konica KD-300Z) for about the same price. However there are few reviews and little product information available... The s330 has the cool Elph shape, is slightly thicker than its predecessors, but has a solid feel to it.A few items of note to guide the (first-time) shopper based on 2 months of use:1. BATTERY. Battery life is very good. I also bought a generic NB-1LH as a back up from SterlingTek; it is purportedly 800mAH, versus the Canon brand 840mAH and previous Canon NB-1L (680mAH)that first came with the s330.2. MEDIA. Bought a 256MB TypeI CF card, and can now get ~256 photos at the highest resolution (vs. the 8MB that comes with the camera). I rarely take that many pictures at a time before a download, so there is also much room for video clips. Being the TypeA that I am, I also bought an extra 128MB at a good price that may come in handy when traveling for tourist-type photos.3. MOVIES. The movie clip quality is as others have remarked, only satisfactory even at the highest resolution setting. (I almost do not notice a difference between settings). However, the clips do include SOUND and provide a TON of ENTERTAINMENT! The files are already at about 3MB size. It would be difficult to share larger files. (For better quality, one should consider a video camera.) The clips are best viewed at about the size of the 1.5\" LCD screen. *DO* remember to record in landscape format (!) as you cannot rotate the clip for viewing.4. DOWNLOADING. The software and USB cable method appear to work well. Although downloading directly from the camera will consume batter power, I don't feel compelled to by a CF reader or an AC adapter since I have the extra battery. Others have remarked on the flimsy rubber cover over the A/V out and digital out and speculate that it may not last the life of the camera.5. IMAGES. The images are excellent. If they turn out substandard, you may be able to clean them up w/the accompanying software. If you're good with the manual settings, you can probably get the quality you are looking for. Definitely comparable to my old 35mm; and I don't see a huge difference from a friend's 3MP (Canon Powershot S30).6. LIGHTING/OTHER. The camera has excellent compensation for different lighting (natural, cloudy, flourescent, tungsten, etc.) Alternatively, you can adjust this manually.  The Elph line appears to have problems with red-eye reduction.  Others have remarked that the red-eye reduction setting is less than satisfactory.  Thank goodness for software editing (on CD that comes with camera).7. ZOOM. I think a 3x optical zoom is a MUST for a 2MP camera. Turned off the digital zoom, as I don't want false hope of having quality zoom at the purported ~7.5x total zoom. The zoom is actually slightly better than my old 35mm.8. OTHER MANUAL FEATURES. I've always been a point-and-shoot user, however, there appear to be many manual features that offer a lot of flexibility. I suggest practicing with these features, e.g. exposure, white balance, shutter speed, iso.9. CASE. Doesn't come with camera. I bought the Canon PSC-300 case which has a small hole for the wrist stap to pass though and may be worn on your belt. I tried the PSC-20 case.  It was just too large for me, I could also stick the USB connector in the bottom.  I picked up a cheap case (under ten dollars) by Lowerpro which fits like a glove!  It has a zipper pouch without the annoying velcro flap-over of the PSC-300 and PSC20 that would stick to my wrist strap.I have to admit a bit of \"pixel envy\", but the 2MP and seems adequate for most of my cropping/enlargement needs, and printing 4x6s to 5x7s, possibly 8x10s. 3MP will likely provide more cropping/enlargement options considering the current optical zoom limits. My criteria were size and image quality for approximately three- to four-hundred US$. When canon comes out with a 3MP I will consider upgrading when the price comes down to current s330 prices.  (Since my original writing Canon came out with the s230--I'm not totally sure which I would buy at this point.)If you're looking for a compact 2MP camera, the s330 is the ONE for you!Update... i just bought the s400.

I was using a point and shoot 35 mm Nikon with a zoom and I wanted to go digital. To me, the S330 takes just as good pictures.

So far my impression of the camera is very positive. In the sub-compact catagory, the S330 probably have the best image quality (in my opinion). There are some issues under low light conditions. I think you should take this into consideration if you are looking at this camera.1. For example, the auto-focus have a hard time locking under low light conditions. The picture is actually in focus, but the indictator says otherwise. As long as you hold the camera still for long shutter speeds the camera should take a well focused picture under low light conditions. The focus assist light is not that great either, but most other models in this catagory don't even have this feature.2. Not a good camera to take distant objects at night. The flash is too small and weak, but that is a trade off for having a small camera.3. The biggest issue with this camera is probably the auto white balance. If you use the auto mode under artificial light, the AWB feature doesn't work well at all!!! But this can be corrected under manual mode. I hope Canon will have a firmware fix for this.Overall, it's hard for you to go wrong buying this little camera. The image quality is above average. Its size and construction is top of the class. My only real big complain is the camera is too pricy for 2MP. Oh... In addition, 50 bucks for another battery is not that cheap either (you should get one for long trips). 8MB compact flash card is so somewhat useless (only 10-32 max shots depending on the quality). So you probably to have spend another 150 dollars to make the camera \"complete\".If you haven't looked at other subcompacts, I recommend Nikon Coolpix 2500 and Minolta DiMage X. Those are great cameras too, but S330 filled my needs betters than those two.

As much as I enjoy the S110, (I take it everwhere) I needed more features that the  S330 offers. I am willing to trade off extra  features for the S110's smaller size. The menus are easier to navigate and the red eye reduction seems to be more effective. The price for the S330...at Amazon is comparable to what I paid for the S110. The zoom feature during playback has a higher magnification and you have the ability to zoom in at all areas of the photos. The built-in speaker is an added bonus during video and memo playback. An extra battery (NB-1LH), higher capacity compact flash cards (32M, 64M and 128M) and soft case  go a long way towards making this excellent camera more useful and mobile.

Couldn't find some of my needed features, however, in the lesser models so I guess I can live with these unused luxuries and maybe learn them too... I do find it a bit slow on getting ready to take a flash picture in the dark as it has to adjust, in an almost \"automatic\" way that you wish you could more readily override, thus making your subjects wait a bit longer than they'd expect. (Hold that smile, everyone!) You have to almost hold down--as if to force--the button in order to finally get it to take a shot. I have had to re-press the button at times, and could miss action that a simpler point-and-shoot digital might have gotten. I have often decided to turn on the camera, instantly click certain settings to turn off the flash, and snap pictures without. I can often adjust them using Photoshop on my home system. In skiing, I like to try to get friends doing jumps or other active shots, and so since this is mostly in the daytime, you dont need a flash and the cam does not start up forcing you to use it. In order to now get those \"perfectly timed\" shots, you can, with the S330, teach yourself to carefully \"half-press\" and the camera is now, in contrast to the above, sooo itchin' to take an instant shot that any jiggle at all could do just that, so be ready! (the little lights will flash as you stand alert...) Now when you finish pushing down the button , it snaps on command which is awesome because you can say, \"I got you jumping in mid-air!\" Bought online a second battery (definitely recommended) but it was made by Optex (NOT recommended) because it empties in no time! I will buy another Canon --only. To save power, I also often instantly turn off the display (although you get a more centered shot when using it to frame subject) which comes on as the default (I like cameras that it does not come on as the default). seems as though the cumbersome software CD does not work with windows 2000ME, but maybe I should try reinstall a 4th time...or go with USB cards and reader. (that would give me more ease in travel) In the end, it is the compact size, pic quality and style of this cam I like best. I can live with having to work around the other things and so it is great, but not as easy as say, an Olympus, to hand to someone else and say, \"Can you just take a picture of me?\" I guess I gotta do a lot of stuff at home with Photoshop to many of my pictures later.", "Date": "October 9, 2002"}, {"Title": "Best compact digital on the market", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R207B6DIMMDI00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelent value for the money, great image quality, solid build quality, and many features not found on other cameras.

I recommend it to all my friends. This is my first digital camera and I did A LOT of research before I bought one because I knew NOTHING when I started. Before this camera, I had/have a Pentax Zoom 105R (film) which I absolutely loved and still love. but, I'd been wanting a digital and one main reason was to take it on a ghost hunting tour. (The orbs and ectoplasm show up much better on digitals rather than film for some reason, and you get to see them instantly with a digital). :-) Anyway, the tour takes place primarily at night, and in some dark areas (dark pubs and graveyards) and I'd read that a lot of the digitals don't do well in low light situations. I bought this model because it had automatic settings as well as manual settings so I could adjust for low light. Well, the Canon took FANTASTIC pictures in almost complete darkness! And the pics I took on the tour in Sepia and Black and White turned out really cool!  I didn't think I'd need a huge zoom since my film camera has such a huge zoom. I figured I could just use the Pentax when I needed a big zoom and the digital zoom on the Canon is generally sufficient. I don't use the Optical zoom at all because it starts looking grainy and fuzzy. I think if I was going to buy another digital, I'd go ahead and invest in this same type of Canon but with larger zoom because I've found I never take my film camera with me anymore and sometimes it would be nice to have a little more zoom capability. Generally this camera takes AWESOME pictures in almost every situation. I've compared ease of use and quality of pictures to my friends'cameras and I think my Canon blows them away. It is also small, so it actually fits in my jeans' back pocket. The LCD monitor is a nice size so I use it almost exclusively vs. the viewfinder. The movie/sound function is pretty cool too. I've taken movies of friends skiing, puppies running around and my cat flying thru the air chasing a bug, and they all turned out great. I do have to be careful about what I say as I am filming because the microphone is pointed toward the filmer not the subject, for some bizarre reason. For instance, I've got recordings of \"me\" saying \"Oh crap\" when I goofed up something while shooting a movie. :-) ---- I really like the brushed, silver metal body. I thought it might scratch easily, but 6 months later and there isn't a scratch on it. And it feels solid, so I don't worry about it breaking easily. ----- The software that comes with this camera is excellent!! You just plug one end of the cable to the side of the camera and one end to your USB port and the software automatically comes up on your screen! Once you've programmed it the first time to the folder you want to download to, about the only thing you have to do is hit \"Next\". It is so unbelievably simple! Much easier than what my friends have said theirs are.  --------  The only things that are a little annoying are: 1) the battery cover is on the bottom of the camera directly below the shutter button which means your thumb is usually there to hold the camera. I've found that the cover slides off too easily and when it does, the power goes off. Several times, I've thought my battery was dead only to discover the cover was open. (Luckily it is attached so it won't fall off - and the battery has a little hinge over it so it won't fall out either). ---- 2) The Optical zoom is pretty much worthless because it gets so fuzzy when you get to it. (the zoom automaticaly goes thru the digital zoom settings, THEN to Optical). I just stop zooming when it digital zoom gets to the maximum. --- 3) There is a delay between when you first press the shutter button and when it actually takes the picture. I frequently take pictures of squirming puppies for my mother's website. As you can imagine, I've missed some shots because of the delay. Luckily, it's digital so I can just delete and keep snapping away. Go to [a website] if you want to see examples of pictures this camera has taken. Every picture on this site was taken with this Canon. Note: the pics that appear \"blurry\" around the edges were done that way on purpose with editing software. **** One helpful hint, as everyone else says, go ahead and invest in a backup battery. They are rechargable and the recharger comes with the camera so it's easy to be recharging a battery while using the other. I also bought a 128MB memory card. The camera comes with an 8MB, but believe me, once you start snapping pictures with this camera, that won't be enough.
