I was very pleased by the quality and ease of use the camera has.Setting up the camera was very easy and I had no problems.The camera's clarity is incredible for its price range, considering that it also pans and scans (with great range of motion).Speaking to clarity, when the camera moves in any direction, the motors makes a little noise...  Not obnoxious or anything, but curious cats had to come check it out each time we moved it while away.  Using the snapshot ability on the camera, we got some of the best pictures of the 'kids' we've gotten from any camera when we were there in person.The camera worked flawlessly - what a great way to ease your mind if you have good internet access where the camera is and where you'll be.Highly recommended... I'm writing this review because I'm back to order another for different part of the house. :-)", "Date": "November 3, 2004"}, {"Title": "Works great with Mac OS", "Author": "B. Moraes", "ReviewID": "R2R5Z6N8PTNA6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review was originally posted by JC for the Wireless version of this camera. I'm adapting here his suggestions for the wired version.Don't be fooled by the documentation that states \"Windows Required\". It will work fine on your Mac OS X. Here are step-by-step instructions for setting it up using a Mac (don't worry, the steps go by quickly!):1) Plug-in camera to AC and hold down the \"reset\" pin with a pen. My computer would not recognize the camera until I physically reset it.2) Connect the camera via Cross Over Ethernet cable to you Mac.3) Temporarily give your Mac the manual IP address 192.168.0.5 and subnet 255.255.255.0 in the Network Prefs.4) Connect to the camera using Safari at address 192.168.0.253 - you should be able to see the settings page now. Choose username and preferences, but say \"No\" when it asks if you want to \"access from the internet\". This will make it try to find your router (which is not on the network) so don't do it.5) Enter 192.168.0.253 in Safari once again and it should take you to the Network Camera page. You should have access to the camera controls after you click the \"Single\" tab at the top of the page. But we're not done yet.6) Click the Setup tab on right side of the tabbed toobar.7) Click Static IP to load the static ip address page for the camera8) Uncheck the \"Enable\" checkbox at the top. This is for Windows setup.9) Enter an IP address in your wireless network. My network is 192.168.2.x so I gave my camera 192.168.2.253.10) Enter your router's address in the Default Gateway field. Example: 192.168.2.1. If you don't do this, your camera will not be accessible from outside your wireless network!11) Enter  your ISP DNS server address, otherwise you won't be able to send automatic e-mails when trigger events occur nor use the viewnetcam service from Panasonic12) Click Save.13) Disconnect the ethernet cable from your computer and connect the camera to the router using a REGULAR network card (not the same cross over).14) Unplug the camera power, replug camera power (to restart it)15) The camera should now go through it's blinking light procedure and if all is well you'll get a solid green light.16) Go to your Network Prefs and set your computer back to connecting to the internet17) You should now be able to access your camera at the address 192.168.2.25318) Your router blocks traffic from the internet to your camera so you cannot view the camera from outside your network. To access your camera from the internet you'll neet to open a port on your router that maps to your camera. This can be done by setting up a \"Virtual Server\" (aka port forwarding) on the router. See your router's instructions for mapping a virtual server to your camera's IP and port.19) Configure the remaining settings (date & time, email triggers, etc)Happy viewing...", "Date": "December 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not too shabby...", "Author": "Plank", "ReviewID": "R1Q7WCUKD3JNB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not an expert on webcams but I have done a lot of research.  My main computer is a Windows XP machine but I wanted to view webcam images on my Mac Powerbook and cell phone.  First of all, the price is right, about half the cost of a Toshiba camera I was thinking about.  Set up was automatic with my Linksys router.  Image quality is good and has several settings.  It has some nice features that are easy to use.  You have to play with the confusing buffer/transfer/email settings for a while so you don't get overloaded with email.  Motion is often blurry.  For Mac users, Safari and IE will not work on your free Panasonic web page.  Firefox will.  On my i500 Palm Smartphone, WebPro browser doesn't work but Blazer will.  It works great with Snappermail too.

I too am very pleased. The camera pretty much sets itself up with the installation CD, after it's connected to the power and the network (Cat-5 cable not included!). For streaming video available on the internet, outside of the LAN firewall, certain network configurations are necessary and would be automatic with a router with UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) capability. My router is the current SBC DSL Modem/Router (the OfficePortal 1800HG) and it doesn't seem to have UPnP. I thought I was in trouble. But the camera immediately appeared on my network device list with its own IP address, and I was able to make its firewall settings open for a web server. I could then reach the camera over the internet using the IP address, even without using Panasonic's free viewnetcam.com service. But at that point viewnetcam.com started to recognize the camera and I was able to use viewnetcam.com to rename the IP address.I can allow full internet access, or restrict access to specific users. And the pan and tilt can be controlled from anywhere on the web. It's really possible to keep an eye on things from anywhere. The control page allows for watching and controlling multiple cameras -- from anywhere! I'm thinking of buying a couple more of these.", "Date": "October 22, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very impressive Network Camera", "Author": "A.

Setup was a breeze and so far they've performed very well.For my application, I had to find & purchase outdoor weatherproof housings that would fit, wire my own PoE (Power over Ethernet) adaptors, and set up a recording software & web access tool.  Individually, you can log into each camera directly from the internet.  But using a separate software tool makes the task much simpler.  The free software panasonic provides for the cameras may work, but it is severly lacking in features.  I like Netcam Watcher Pro, and WebcamXP for multi-camera setups.  Neither is free, but both work very well.I'm successfully running 2 of the cameras on approx 150'-200' of Cat5 cable carying power along the same line.  Supprisingly, it was able to boot up and operate without moving to a larger power supply.

I wanted a system that would record when my PC was turned off, so I bought one of the \"all-in-one\" systems.  The software on that system is abysmal, which gave me newfound appreciation for the tools bundled with this Panasonic.  First is the built-in web server, which allows you to view and control (pan and tilt) the camera over the Internet, if you have your network configured correctly.  Plus, there is an included utility, \"Network Camera Recorder\" which lets you schedule and review video recorded to a Windows PC.  You can slow down and speed up while you are looking for the miserable yahoos attempting to steal something from your property.The camera can also upload JPEGs to an FTP server, which can provide a backup source of data.Finally, the clarity of the image on this camera is far superior to the cameras that came with my security system, although they are both advertised to be 640x480.The only real drawback is that this camera cannot be installed outdoors.", "Date": "March 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "A great buy!", "Author": "J. Justice", "ReviewID": "RY7VNJITWJ0T3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now when I first was searching for internet cameras, I looked at different options from different vendors and narrowed down a list of features: quality of the video, internet accessible, home security, and of course the price.  Before purchasing any products I like to read the user reviews because the end users are the best critics.  This camera defiantly meets all of these qualities and more.  The video quality is great for a lower end internet camera and very happy that I got a one that you can control.  This camera offers a WIDE range of viewing.  Setting it up on the internet was a breeze.  I could launch the camera from any location that was internet accessible (however never tested over dial up).  The email features and motion detection is a great way to keep informed of activity when your away from home as well you can setup an ftp connections to upload snapshots at a specified time.  One of the greatest features is you don't have to your home PC running to use the camera.  It has its own built in web server and connects directly to your home network.I use cable internet and Linksys router and was very easy to setup.  You can use UPnP or setup your own port forwarding.  Most residential ISP will block port 80, but this camera can be set up using a different port to allow access from the internet.  Using Panasonics netviewcam.com is a nice way to personalize your camera on the internet using DNS and it's FREE!The only con about the camera is the manual could be a little more informative, but you can always go online and find out what you need to know.  My friends who seen the camera and controls are considering purchasing one for themselves.  Now since this is my first internet camera, I can't really compare to others but if you're looking for a good buy, this is the camera for you.", "Date": "August 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "Luis H.

Setup was a breeze.I have not yet used the Dynamic IP service from Panasonic, but I think it will work fine as any other service of this type.The automatic PnP function did not work trying to configure my Linksys router. A minor nuance if you do not know how to setup your router.Image quality is very good, but not excelent. The camera has a little trouble working on the white balance, but the provided controls on the browser application let you adjust, so no problem here either. Again, image quality is way above webcams, better that other network cams on the price range, but below than higher ticket net cams.A nice feature is that you can set up to 4 positions (there are five already preset: camera corners and home position), so you can easly go from checking the door to the desk, etc. in one single mouse click.Althoug it is designed to be set on a fixed position, on my tests I hooked up to a mini-tripod. By accident, I pull the network cord making the camera fell to the hard floor from about 5 feet.

Best of all, you don't have to use IE to view the image. Works with Firefox as well. The only thing I didn't like was the weak ethernet/power port cover. They even add a slip of paper warning you about the ease with which it will break. I didn't see the slip until it was too late. When you remove the little cover to access the ethernet and power ports, be *very* careful. Otherwise, it's a great camera.

I use it on a home network and any computer can monitor the video - even laptops on my wireless 802.11g network (connected to a router and a WAP). With the free \"viewnetcam\" DNS service I can access it while away on travel. Fairly easy to set up but like all networking equipment some knowledge of IP's and ports is necessary. I recommend changing the default port.Motion detection does not work when pointing the camera though a window, like you might do to monitor your front porch. And their \"Network Camera Recorder\" software is rudimentary at best.If you want true software Motion Detection, there is shareware available that works well with this camera.

It moves up, down, and side to side.  It does adjust for light, which worked well from dim to bright light, but it does not have any night vision, so once it's dark and your lights are off (mine were on a timer), you can't see anything.  Also, it doesn't shoot tasers at anyone trying to rob the house, so if you do catch someone inside, all you can do is call the police and take a snapshot (assuming they didn't already find and unplug the camera).The only warning I would give is that you need to make sure you have a router within an ethernet cable's distance of where you want to put it.  If you're not sure, it's probably worth springing the extra $50 and getting the wireless version.Update 1/31/10: I now have 4 various cameras in this series, and I've run into a frustrating issue multiple times that I wanted people to be aware of.  Access to these cameras seems to randomly stop working every now and then.  You just have to redo part of the setup and they work fine again, but it is frustrating when you are away from home for long periods of time and are counting on using the cameras to be able to monitor your house.

User manual is too simplistic to be of much use if you need to manually configure your router for port forwarding.  I learned more about routing tables, forwarding ports, static NAT and a host of other things than I ever wanted, or should have needed, to learn in order to get this working.  This despite the fact that my router supposedly supported uPnP (plug and play).  I split the blame across Panasonic (poor manual / instructions), Westell (horrific wireless router) and Verizon (my DSL provider who told me they don't support, and can't help me figure out, port forwarding using my Westell router).  Where did I get this router?  Verizon of course!  I didn't have a choice.So all in all, I'd give 5 stars for the camera, 0 stars for Verizon, 1 star for the panasonic manual and 0 stars for Westell.
