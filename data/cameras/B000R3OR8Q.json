{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great little point and shoot camera", "Author": "Nameless Faceless User", "ReviewID": "R2JLVEEJ1PB2S0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great little point and shoot camera for candid shots.  It's tiny, easy to clip onto your belt and carry it around all day.  Large LCD screen, easy to navigate menus which gives you what you're looking for fairly quickly.  It has many features not found on other similar models, some of which include a separate setting for brightness, contrast, and color saturation, manual focus, excellent white balance selection and easy to use manual white balance, auto ISO selection, and anti-shake.  It has a collection of \"Best Shot\" images which are presets for the most common situations, including night shots, backlit, fireworks, and portraits - which have helpful comments to let you know what each preset does.For close-up and indoor photos, this is a wonderful camera under a variety of lighting.  Outdoor shots and landscape images do not quite sparkle as well as a high-end digital SLR, but only a professional photographer would be able to tell the difference.  It blows away the built-in camera in your cell phone at any rate and is a must-have camera for vacation snapshots.The USB charging cradle I'm not that crazy about.  But, it's a simple matter to open battery/card slot and use a card reader to bring the images into a computer.  It uses ordinary SD/MMC(+) cards.  For making movies, the manual recommends high speeds memory cards at 10mb/sec or better to avoid dropouts.  The movie quality and audio recording just blew me away when I played the movie on my computer.  I purchased extra batteries and a charger from Impact, rather than using the cradle to charge the camera - but, that's a matter of personal preference.  The camera allows you to quickly swap out the battery or the memory card if either becomes used up.I found the outdoor images a bit flat, so am I still tweaking the contrast and saturation settings for the best images.  I also have a rule to never use software which comes on the CD.  My only complaint is that the full manual comes on the CD, but it can also be downloaded from Casio's website.  Casio's customer service was quick and responsive when I asked them the maximum memory size for their flash cards.  The manual mentions 1gig cards, but the latest model cameras can handle up to 4gig.  Then again, 1gig cards will be faster for better quality movies.I am using the camera for indoor candid shots and it's better than my professional digital camera in many respects for this type of photography.  I can carry it on my belt since it's smaller than my cell phone.  While it will not replace my professional digital camera, it has the ability to grab images which the big, heavy camera cannot.  And while its not a professional camera, it has enough features to keep a professional photographer happy.", "Date": "November 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Extremely pleased with the Casio Exilim line", "Author": "Gina B. \"It's a dry heat!\"", "ReviewID": "R3S82N2HS87NFC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am extremely pleased with the Casio Exilim line of cameras.  This is the third I've owned and I am nothing short of thrilled.  I had tried a top of the line Sony prior to this, and the image quality was nothing like the quality with the Casios - even one that was 3 years old.  The case is sleek and the LCD screen is large.  The features are all easy to use and the battery life is long.  I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "October 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Amazing little camera!", "Author": "Joshua Davy \"J. Davy\"", "ReviewID": "RGL2THXGYYTQ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a small camera that I could just pop in my pocket, to take pictures while I was out. This camera is not the smallest, but fits well in most any pocket. It blew my mind when I started playing with all the functions. I previously had a Canon A-series which has a lot of useful settings. Well this little camera blows that out of the water. It has what is called the BS(Best Shot) mode. Lets you select from many, many different scenerios(water, sunset, night, portrait, pets, etc.) and automatically adjust the light aperture. You can also manual set them for a custom look. The 12.1MP are amazing, and help to also take quality video! Widescreen and fullscreen. With the editing software it comes with you can make some pretty polished films. Excellent camera definitely worth it!Cons for me:Small internal memory. Bought a 4GB SD card. Way more than enough. 400+ pics in full 12.1MP, and more than an hour of HQ wide video.Like most new cameras saving space to make them smaller, you can only connect it to a PC with a docking station. It comes with it and works well. Even plays elevator music, if you want, while looking at the pics!", "Date": "December 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Cerius Photobug \"serious\"", "ReviewID": "R24EEJSN0LRRNY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Combine the tested fun and easy Casio interface with a high resolution sensor and usual solid build with quick handling and voila! EX Z1200. New shake reduction was a nice feature! I use it for snaps and close-ups like it's predecessor the Z60 which was slightly smaller and 6 mp. Better battery life and anti-shake make up for the extra weight...besides it stll fits the same tiny case! It is what it is - a compact, beautifully finished camera that will never be my Nikon D200 (that's good and bad, but still a rediculous comparison)", "Date": "August 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great compact camera", "Author": "Nersi Pouya \"Nersi\"", "ReviewID": "R1CCPGJZMQK46N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a 5M pixel camera before and it was 5 years old.  My new Casio camera takes great pictures and you can control a lot of setting.  Great battery life.  Obviously the quality of the pictures will not be close to SLR cameras. As far as reviewing it on big screen or printing up to A4 size paper they are clear.  I did not have any problems. It can take pictures in low light compared to my previous digital 5M camera.But I wanted a camera with underwater capability too.  I bought the underwater casing.  The pictures taken underwater are great too.  I had to buy a strobe.  To take the pictures underwater.  Then took a course to get better and get some of my questions answered.  I would buy this camera again.", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sweet Camera", "Author": "Dattucha", "ReviewID": "R3A2OAQL18EW1N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I generally am a fan of the casio cameras...for quality, practicality, and the usb cradles (as opposed to the ones where you have to physically take out the battery and charge it separately...pretty lame).And this one is no exception.  The only thing I wish was that instead of the 2.8\" lcd screen, they'd gone with the full 3\" one (like Canon SD750).  The reason it makes a difference is because when you take standard size pictures you end up with two blacked out bars on the sides...which essentially is equivalant to a 2.5\" screen.  True, you can resize to 3x2 or 16x9 format and also the cropping only happens when you're in a shooting and not the viewing mode...but none of this would be a problem if they'd just made the screen 3\".But hey...I've given up on finding a perfect camera...none of them have all the right features in any single package.
