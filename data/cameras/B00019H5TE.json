I have a husband & 2 daughters and I take pictures all the time-My film developing bill was high! Now I can pick and choose the shots I want to print. I can also create family albums on the computer - to eventually be put onto CD's & set to music!They have the 5 megapixel camera's out, but I really don't think that I see that much of a difference with this 4 megapixel. I get Great photos-sharp & clear. And the zoom lets me be flexible with my shots. The color is awesome!-These pictures turn out beautiful!!This is a smaller camera than any I saw. I like the sleek design.You can also shoot 2 minutes of QVGA video. I haven't done enuf with this feature yet, but I know it's longer than some camera's on the market allow for video time.I have used the Auto mode quite a bit while getting used to the camera, but it also has portait, close-up, night, sport, snow, & many other modes! It has flash, & red-eye reduction.  You can even store email addresses in the camera & hit the \"share\" button to share special photos with your contacts. It comes with a rechargable lithium-ion battery and a sleek charger that you can plug into an outlet.This camera is simple to learn & the pictures are amazing! I highly recommend this camera!1smileycat :-)", "Date": "June 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "Wicked happy!", "Author": "shutter bug \"soccer & band mom\"", "ReviewID": "RTBGOLF2JW5EC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera through Amazon and received it a day or two before my sister-in-law's wedding.  I charged the battery the preceding night, took a ton of wedding shots (in and outside) and many other shots throughout the next month.  After nearly 30 days, well over 100 shots, lots of downloading, a wedding and a visit to my daughter at college the battery finally went out.  Wow!Detail?  I was in my kayak and had a dragonfly land on my lap.  I took the shot and the detail is so good you can see the individual threads in the rip-stop nylon pants I was wearing and the detail of the web in it's wings!Indoors?  I took a shot of my daughter and 2 friends (nighttime, incandescent light) ... she liked the photo so much that we cropped out her friends and edited it and its the photo she's going to use for her senior picture in her yearbook!Video?  My other daughter is in the UMass Marching Band ... so I took 12 short (5-12 sec) videos of the Band and Colorguard at the UMass/Richmond game and the sound, with headphones, is quite good (better than regular TV sound).  The video was best if I didn't pan with the camera. The end of that day is when the battery ran out (one month after a full wedding, all the inbetween photos and 12 marching band short videos!).I did buy an SD card reader at Office Max (...) so now I don't run the battery to download pictures, erase my card, etc.I like the other reviewer's comment that it's like being married to a handsome prince ... it really IS an attractive camera.  After using my daughters Casio Exilim (nearly credit card sized) I knew I wanted a small camera.  I'm a high school administrator and it's very convenient to slip it over my head with the neckstrap and wander around \"capturing the moment.\"I did a lot of internet camera shopping over the summer, waited for just the features I wanted, this camera was released, and I'm very happy with it.I do have an old, outstanding Canon AE-1Program with the huge telephoto lens, etc, so I did not buy this camera intending for it to do everything.  This is my general purpose, get some GREAT shots, have some versatility, digital.  Took my (just what I selected, multiples of some, wallets of another) for a little over $5.0little SD card to Wal-Mart today (I carry it and the reader in an old hardshell glasses case!), got 21 prints 0 ... no waste on bad shots and no going back for reprints after seeing how they came out!I did buy a \"Digital Promaster\" camera case at my local camera shop and when I dropped the camera (in the case) onto pavement from the 10th or so level of the bleachers at a soccer game, the camera was fine!As you can see, I'm a very busy person ... and this camera keeps up with me. Way fun!", "Date": "October 3, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Ditigal Camera!", "Author": "DigiMom", "ReviewID": "R3G357WM4HGXCR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this Kodak LS743 camera after purchasing 2 other digital cameras and returning them. I started with the Nikon CoolPix 3100 which was a 3-megapixel for $179. I took it to the zoo and took some really good pictures, but wasn't entirely pleased with the zoom quality and it had a purplish tinge to the prints so I decided to try a higher megapixel camera. I found the Gateway D510 which was a 5-megapixel for only $199. I was excited to try it out. I was extremely disappointed. The print quality was worse than my old Olympus 2-megapixel and the camera got so hot in my hand while taking just a few pictures and even just reviewing the pix. I took it back the next day and had an extremely difficult time trying to find a good camera.I really wanted the digital camera to take action photos of my son and pets at home. Since I didn't want to make another mistake purchasing a bad camera and having to pay a 15% restocking fee, I took my time playing around with all the cameras at the store. I had the camera associate move around so I could practice taking shots using the sport/action mode. I tested a few Fujis and also a few Canons and they were blurry. I tested the Kodaks and they came out great! I didn't want to pay too much for the camera (I paid $299), but I didn't want to risk buying another cheap one, so I bought the LS743. Right out of the box, it was so easy to use! It did not come with a SecureDigital card, but lucklily I had bought one for the Gateway camera.I practiced taking action shots on the way home by pointing the camera out the window while I was driving and randomly taking pictures. I reveiwd them later and was amazed at the quality. Homes in the background were super crisp and the detail on the cars which were moving at over 30mph were as if they were not moving at all. I couldn't believe it! Little did I know that this camera also has video with audio capability with no time limit (only limited to your SD card memory). The quality of the video is as good as my digital camcorder if not better! I am so happy I went with Kodak.This camera is nicely sized and takes great pix! The ONLY flaw I have found so far is taking pictures in low light - the LCD display is very dark and I can't seem to adjust the brightness. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting an easy-to-use point-and-shoot digital camera with great picture quality. The camera also comes with Kodak software which lets you create digital photo albums and burn them to CDs as slide shows.", "Date": "August 20, 2004"}, {"Title": "WOW !  You can't go wrong with this camera", "Author": "The Guy", "ReviewID": "R2QH84EMXZO250", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are a DP Pro, then please dont read this review. But, if you are like the majority who wants an easy, reliable Digital camera and 'MOST OF THE TIME USE BASIC FEATURES ONLY' person you must read on.I bought this camera after doing lot of research in the net and feedback from my peers. When I got this, I was amazed to see the picture quality and easiness in using it. I was shooting with in 3 hrs after the Fedex guy left. (You've to charge the battery for ~3 hours before first use). I still have to invent all the advanced features and modes of the camera. But, if all DEFAULT and AUTO modes are this good, then I am sure it will be BETTER with advanced features. The battery life time is pretty good too.Only concern is, the door for the output terminals (USB/Adapter),that looks bit shaky!After my initial research, things got filterd in to just three items: One Sony model and two Kodak model, CX7430 and LS743. Sony may be great but it was not good for me because1)Seen pathetic remarks about their customer service2)It has only 90 days warranty.If you combine both(1) and (2) above, its risky to buy their product. I dont beleive in buying extended waranty for electronic stuff because the technology changes rapidly and, in another 2 years, you'll find yourself in a situation to buy a new camera than paying for Extended warranty. Since Kodak has one year warranty and my 'platinum' credit card has another one year free extended warranty, I had to decide between CX7430 and LS743. It was a tough decison, because both cameras are good. But the LS743 is the one that got PCMAG's Editors choice award (...)

BIRD \"SoTex junkie\"", "ReviewID": "R2GC61PUPA8OKI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I decided to purchase this camera for my daughter for Christmas.  I have been encouraging her to take pictures since she was five, and I was, frankly, tired of buying disposables.  Since she is 10, I felt she was old enough to appreciate a camera that she wouldn't abuse, yet would let her share her vision of her world with me.  At a little over $200, I wasn't worried if she dropped it in a pool or a toilet; I gave her the camera with the caveat: it's yours, treat it with care and make it last.If you have children (8-15), you know that they are more technically competent than we were at their age; just as we were more technically competent than our parents during our formative years (think TRS-80, Commodore 64...).My daughter opened the camera, charged the battery, and took digipics within the first 4 hours.  Combined with the printer dock, she was printing digipics of Cliff, our cat, Toby, our dog, and a great group digipic (using the timer function and tripod) with no help from me or the instruction manual.Online services certainly offer more inexpensive per print costs, but how can you compare instant Kodak-quality prints with wait-a-week-save-fifty-cents for slumber parties and last minute science projects.The LS743 certainly is not the most advanced camera in the world, which is why I rate it 4 stars.  However, Kodak has made a camera that is as simple to use as a disposable, and coupled with the printer dock, is a rock-solid introduction to digital photography for your 10 year old daughter or your 70 year old mother.", "Date": "January 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "very happy", "Author": "Adam J.

But I was also kind of camera snob.  A Kodak digital camera?  I thought I wanted something with more snob appeal.  After reading everything I could and going to every store imaginable, I settled on this one.  I liked the size, the weight, and the battery situation. I travel overseas a lot and the charger is a lot more reasonable in size than the other cameras I looked at.  And it's a simple use camera which is exactly what I wanted. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. My pictures are great, the color and clarity outstanding.

Kodak's general ease-of-use was a definite draw to me.I bought the LS743 yesterday, and it was very easy to set up and begin using.  Battery life is excellent, and the battery is rechargeable (I bought a 2nd battery for only $20 to have a spare, too).  The camera is compact but seems very well-put-together.  My in-laws have a 6000 dock, and this camera will work on it, too.The lens is an upscale lens that is supposed to be a bit better than Kodak's lower-end models - I haven't taken enough pictures yet to notice the difference.I'd say the camera is excellent for beginners, but also there are plenty of features in the system for someone who wants to be able to adjust the shots on their own for a more-customized photo.

I'm pleased with it. You can carry it anywhere and it's surprisingly good at wide-range photos of landscapes and buildings as well as group photos at parties and other gatherings.My only problem with it is the flash: it's not very good for inside scenes, unless you are very close to your subject. However, if the room is brightly lit, the photo should be OK. If there is dark furniture or walls, you'll get a black background.It's definitely not good for concerts or stage performances.There is also a half-second latency which could present problems when trying to photograph sports, races, etc.Nonetheless, I've had a lot of fun with this little box.

It takes nice pictures without red-eye. The only issue with it is that it takes so long to reset between pictures that the subjects start to walk away after the first shot. Because of that, I am switching to a new camera soon. The Kodak software is good for uploading images to the Kodak website for sharing pictures easily and ordering photos. But, the software tends to be very buggy and takes forever to install and update.  The Kodak printer dock makes very nice prints -- when it works.

The camera is very beautiful, compact and stylist. On the web, it doesn't look too glamorous but when I saw it at the Bestbuy, I fell in love with it. This camera stands out among all the other cameras. It is even more beautiful than canon s410. The solid construction and ultra compact size allows this camera to be truly pocketable. The blue power button looks very cool and prevents accidental turn on which can damage the lens.The interface is also very user friendly. The zoom dial allows the user to quickly zoom in or out. When needed, you can turn off/on the LCD screen with just one button to save battery life. After you have taken the pictures, you can review and delete them easily without going through the menu. Battery life is excellent. I took more than 150 shots with LCD on one recharge.Performance is very good: Quick start up time (~4 sec) and average shutter lag (<1 sec). Picture processing time (\"shot to shot time\") is also good at only 5/6 sec. There is virtually no red eye. (Only 1 out of 300+ pictures had red eye.) I think it was possible because the camera's long body allowed Kodak to put some distance between the lens and the flash unit. If the indoor light is low, the camera fires two successive flashes - one to contract people's pupil and second one to light up the scene.There are some good extras such as the orientation sensor which automatically shows the pictures in upright position, multispot focus which allows automatic focus even if the subject is not at the center, a TV output which allows you to see pictures and videos on the TV and the video mode with no length restriction (but do NOT expect this camera or any digital camera to replace your miniDV camcorder).BUT Kodak ls743 faults at its main objective - taking good pictures. The jpeg compression is quite strong; it causes loss of details which is quite evident for complex objects such as trees and flower garden. In most cases, the picture doesn't quite look \"sharp.\" Other complaint is the slight tendency toward reddish hue which produces inaccurate flesh tone for moderately dark skin people (Mexicans, Indians, mixed ethnicities, etc.) But for Whites, Asians (Orientals), and African Americans, the pictures are okay.The main problem I have with this camera is dark indoor images... maybe something wrong with the light metering sensor... I tried changing the EV setting, bringing table lamp to add more light in the room and even holding the camera in different ways, but alas, nothing helped. Right now, I am using Paint Shop Pro's \"One Step Photo Fix\" to tweak the pictures into acceptable quality.After reading all the good reviews about this camera, I think I am poor person who had the luck of getting a defective camera.

Since I have bought this product, I know that digital cameras have changed and improved dramatically. Even with that understanding, I LOVE this camera. I originally bought a sony cybershot and spent $200 more than this Kodak camera. After trying to figure out how to take good pictures with the expensive cybershot, I returned the sony and bought the kodak instead.I am pleased with this camera because it is EASY to use. My wife hates electronics and can still take remarkable pictures with the easy share. After 2 years, I have not even looked at the manual or used the kodak software--that's how easy it is. I use the automatic setting and the camera takes wonderful, colorful, bright and crisp pictures. The video recording aspect is good, but who would buy a digital camera to take videos anyway? It is small enough to fit in your pants pocket, but there are smaller cameras out there. The optical zoom could be a bit better and it takes several seconds to take a repeat picture because the lcd screen is a bit slow to refresh.
