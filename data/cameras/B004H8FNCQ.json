There isn't nearly the level of ghosting that I would have expected given it was a 250$ 3D recording device.  I went in thinking I wouldn't get that level of 3D.  Non 3D movies shot in HD end up looking very nice as well.  I've had a flip and two kodaks of this class type in the past and this was the best quality out of all of them.  Also, one thing most of the compact devices lack is any sort of light/flash, it's nice to have a little help in low light situations with the built in led light.  The menus are easy enuf to navigate thru and I love have seperate dedicated buttons for pics or video.  I like the integrated usb slide out dongle.  The unit itself seems to have a good quality build to it.Cons :  No optical zoom in any mode, no zooming digital or optical in 3D mode.  The optical I get, I don't think anything in this class does but the 3d no digital zoom is dissapointing.  Also, it is supposed to have some image stabilization but I found this part of it to be poor too, videos in the upper hd modes can get very jittery.  In playback mode, there is no slideshow or auto play feature I can find which is a shame.  If you have a bunch of mini clips recorded and are trying to watch on the tv, you will have to get up and manually play each clip. Also, I wish, especially with this device having two lenses, there was some lens cover implementation.  The led light is not of the quality of lets say the iphone 4 one, it's nice to have but it does not make this a flash camera or flash video device.  As stated in the other review, the 3d screen is very, very poor, almost unusable in 3D mode.  The 3DS screens in video mode are just as bad though in my opinion.  Battery life does seem to be poor in 3D mode, average in non 3d use.  Quite a bit of my cons I can understand given the class of device it is, hence only the one star ding.  I just wanted to portray all the negatives I had come up against so far.Not con nor pro :  Stills are average per class usual, software provided is averageI didn't test out the sharing options although it seems to have a wealth of them.  Also, in non U.S. territories, there is also a package sold with a panaramic 360 degree view add on device.  The manual talks about it.  As far as I can tell, this device is not sold seperately anywhere yet, and the combo package is not offered natively in the U.S.End of the day, content and 3D integration is still pretty limited for 3DTV users and in that scenario, I reccomend it to 3DTV purchasers as another way to get some bang for their buck from their 3dTV purchase.  That said, would I buy this if I didn't have a 3dTV?  No way, the 3d screen is too poor for that to be the only method of your 3d watching of your content and sans the 3d, all the rest of the features are offered on their lesser costing versions of the bloggie.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good 3D video - Poor 3D LCD", "Author": "jjRobotek", "ReviewID": "R1B3I0P4BR4HEU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sony's first 3D camera makes a good impression but leaves room for improvement.

But its high price tag and lack of accessories earn it only 3 stars.On the positive side, the camera does seem to take pretty decent 3D videos. As advertised, its twin camera lenses enable you to take both still shots and full-motion video in 3D. (It's also possible to take traditional 2D photos and videos). The camera can even snap still shots while simultaneously recording a video.Videos can be played back on a 3D TV, through the YouTube 3D Channel, or right on your Bloggie screen without glasses (though this requires you to look at the little screen from a certain distance and angle, and tires the eyes quickly).As the name \"Bloggie\" suggests, this camera is all about social networking. It's a breeze to make your video, plug it into your computer, trim the length, and then with the click of a button you can upload it to sites like Facebook or YouTube.Nevertheless, this camera has some real shortcomings. It has no optical zoom and takes very poor still shots. Even in good outdoor lighting, I was disappointed. It does not have a flash, though it does come with a mediocre LED light. You will definitely want to buy a separate digital camera if you plan to take a lot of still shots.The design of the back of the camera also makes it difficult to hold with one hand. When taking a video, my thumb keeps wanting to bump into the directional key, which causes the lens to zoom in or out. Another big drawback is that the Bloggie does not have RCA jacks to plug into a traditional TV, nor does it have an AC Adapter (you have to charge it using the USB cable, which means you'd better have your computer with you if you plan to do very much recording).If you want to dabble into 3D movie-making, then the Bloggie might be right for you. It's not a bad camera, but at a retail price of $250, I expected more from Sony than this.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Oh, m'gosh!  A must-have if you have a 3D TV (5- stars)", "Author": "Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "ReviewID": "R1DCLLEAQO0G2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was skeptical of this little camera that purported to shoot digital video in 3D, mostly because I couldn't imagine that it would translate well to my 55\" Samsung 3D TV.  First, I wasn't sure of the compatibility between the Sony Bloggie and Samsung technology.  Second, bad quality video always looks worse when enlarged to 55\".  And last, I read some reviews that said the LCD screen on the back made video look like those old style trading cards that you flipped back and forth to get \"action,\" and I didn't want cheesy fake 3D.  But I'll tell you right now:  you will not care about the pixelated false 3D on the viewing screen once you see it on your TV.  The Sony Bloggie 3D is not perfect, and it does have its cons; however, I haven't had such fun with a video camera since I got my first generation Flip camera.  Although it can also shoot 2D, I see no reason to get this if that's your primary purpose since there are less expensive options.  You'd be better off with Kodak PlaySport HD Waterproof Pocket Video Camera (Black) or, if you can find one, Flip UltraHD Video Camera.The Bloggie comes with a short USB extender (in case you can't plug it into your computer directly using the Flip-like USB arm) and a wrist strap.  If you want to view this on your 3D TV, you'll have to also get a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable.  I bought AmazonBasics High-Speed Mini-HDMI to HDMI Cable with Ethernet (6.5 Feet/2 Meters) but any length or brand will do, as long is one end is mini-HDMI (for the camera) and HDMI for the TV AND high-speed.  (Older HDMI cables might not support the greater demands of 3D.) The camera does not come with a case or even a pouch, so you might want to get something to protect the lenses.  The Bloggie does not have a removable battery and must be charged via USB.The camera itself has two lenses, side by side, to shoot stereoscopic video.  The body is much more slender than the Flip UltraHD -- and that's a feat.  The record button has just the right amount of sensitivity.The 4x zoom can only be used in 2D mode; although the zoom is more powerful than the Flip UltraHD's, the results are more grainy.  The on-screen menu takes some getting used to, although with use it gets easier.  Changing between 3D and 2D modes requires pressing only one button, and for that, I'm thankful.  The no-glasses-required LCD screen, while not showing you how good the video will be on your 3D TV, certainly gives you an idea of what you have.  The tripod attachment hole is on the short end of the camera, requiring a vertical positioning of the camera; unfortunately, you can shoot 3D ONLY in a horizontal orientation.  The camera is smart enough to know the orientation, so it both warns you if you can't take 3D that way and adjusts the on-screen menu so you can read it.The software that comes with the Bloggie is bare-bones.  Even trimming the ends of a video is not intuitive.  And weeks after receiving the Bloggie, I'm still trying to install a firmware update on my iMac.  You cannot view or edit the 3D video using a regular video editing program because the camera shoots two separate images that are merged in a file with a .thm suffix, although you can convert any 3D video to 2D MP4 format, which then can be edited.  Fortunately, the Bloggie software allows you to move 3D video from your computer, where it is saved in your Bloggie library, back to the camera for playback on your 3D TV.  Unless you have the necessary software and DVD burner, you cannot save the 3D video to a DVD for later playback.  Everything must be replayed through the Bloggie, making that mini-HDMI cable crucial to your enjoyment of your 3D home video.  It's easy to share videos shot with it, albeit in 2D, with the Facebook, YouTube, and special circles icons at the top of the software window.  I don't understand why the software won't allow me to combine clips into a single movie that I can then play back through my Bloggie.  To me, that's a major omission. Only 3- stars for the software.The drawbacks are not enough to take away the wow-factor of this camera.  When I sat my husband down with Samsung 3D glasses and started up the video, his first comment was, \"Holy cow!\"  Then, he said, \"This is the real reason to get a 3D TV.\"  The depth of the video is awesome.  I recorded birds on a feeder, and they hopped into the foreground, underneath the swaying flowers that seemed to reach out of the screen, but perhaps even more impressive was the baseball game I recorded, with rows of people in front of me and the game unfolding beyond them.  It felt as though I was there again.  Wow.  This camera is perfect for recording family get-togethers, sports events, nature (as long as it's close up), and special occasions.  It makes home movies seem more real.  5+ stars for how it looks on my 3D TV.Don't bother purchasing this camera if you do not have a 3D set because playback on the no-glasses LCD screen is not satisfying enough.  And unless you have the right equipment, don't expect to burn DVDs to share among 3D sets.  The best thing you can hope for is to save the video to your computer now so you can create 3D movies and DVDs in the future when 3D technology has gotten more prevalent.For now, though, my whole family is in love with the Sony Bloggie 3D.  Although it makes me yearn for better software and playback options, I wouldn't give it up for anything.  5 stars for the sheer fun of seeing home video in 3D.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "excellent 3d camera", "Author": "Elizabeth J.

It takes 5mp stills and full hd movies, as well as the option for 3d. The depth effect is very good. Also, I wanted to say that even though some other reviewers said there isn't any good software for it, there is plenty of great PC and mac software for processing and viewing 3d photos and videos, some of which is free. For creating red/cyan anaglyphs as well as many other formats, I recommend StereoPhotoMaker ([...]). If you prefer the ColorCode (yellow-blue) anaglyph format and want automatic ghost and retinal rivalry reduction, you probably want ColorCode 3-D Editor (48euros at time of writing, [...]). For creating videos, you can use VLMC, a free, open source video maker by VideoLan, the makers of VLC Media Player (free, [...]). For editing the 3d effect in 3d videos, get StereoMovieMaker (free, [...]).

I would recommend all of this software, although it seems as though there is a pretty strong trend towards the higher priced products being better.The only cons I have noticed when using the camera is that there is no zoom in 3d mode.

(Lets be honest at less than $200 it really is a bargain compared to most Video Cameras)The truth is I haven't been disappointed. OK It's not a pro camera like many of my others, and it doesn't have the best features. But you're not buying it for that.

Operation is simple, but in some cases a bit too simple, for example, when I connect an HDMI cable (Sony A-C) the camera automatically reverts to 2D output. I can manually switch the 3D TV to any of three types of 3D, (SBS should work in this case) but whether the camera is connected to the TV or not, just plugging in the HDMI makes the camera go into 2D mode, and there is no 'switch' to make it change to 3D. I have concluded that there is either a very specific Sony A-C HDMI cable for this application (unlikely) or that the Sony Bloggie 3D camera is made to be proprietary - that is, it will only work with Sony 3D systems and other manufacturers with which they have a relation. It appears that there may be some communication between the TV and camera that is not there as it's not a Sony. I'm not sure of this, and I hope I'm mistaken, but given that I was unable to get an answer from Sony support, it's looking that way. They suggested I contact the TV manufacturer. Bottom line is, it's not the TV manufacturer's issue. This Sony camera either works with *any* (or most) 3D capable TV's though the 3D standard HDMI connection or it does not, and if so, it should be clearly stated in the marketing and advertising or it's intentionally misleading. The TV itself is excellent, and I've had no other problems with 3D playback of Blu-ray content or even over the network connection.For anyone experiencing this issue (and I cannot actually find that it is an issue yet) I have been able to play all video and stills on the same 46\" 3D HDTV by connecting the Bloggie to a Sony Blu-Ray player via the USB and finding the files individually. This generally works on files stored on the hard drive of the computer, but in some cases they are not reliably displayed identified as 3D files. This might work with a computer and network connection that is fast enough to support HD video, and at some point you need to get the content out of the camera and store it somewhere anyway. Just as well to be able to play it right from a storage disk. Alternatively it would seem that files could be burned to DVD and played that way to but again, throughput would have to be capable for the task.Aside from the work-arounds, I will need to be able to connect this camera to my current, (new) 3D HDTV or the Sony Bloggie will be returned. HDMI is supposed to be a universal connection, in agreement with a consortium, but there can and have been those companies that try for exclusivity by making products that are compatible with only their own components. Again, I hope this is incorrect, but maybe it will save someone the trouble and wasted time if they are aware up front that there may be problems. I am still trying, and may see if anyone at Sony support has anything useful to offer on this, which could include simply admitting that it is programmed not to work with my particular TV with HDMI.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for Videos and Sharing, Still Shots Function Needs Work", "Author": "VeraP", "ReviewID": "R3P5GCQVT7J5QK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera arrived in a cute little black box - I took it out, attached the cord, and was ready to shoot.

I bought this with the plan to edit the 3D videos I shoot for projects, and I don't know if it's gonna happen.  So far the 3D video files created have not opened in any of the editing programs I've tried, even after trying to convert them into other file types.  I've tried scanning the files for Codecs and the program would not recognize them.

I don't like the fact that it doesn't come with an AC adapter, thankfully my phone charger works for it.There's no zoom (this has been said over and over again, and it's understandable).The price reflects what this camera is to be used for; as a hobby and recreationally.

It may be better CMOS as Sony claims, but there will be grains at low light conditions.  And you don't even have a flash light.  In normal operating conditions and lighting, I have no complain.As the name suggest, it is really for people who blog all the time and share their pictures and short clips.  It has 3D and a little more convenient than a good camera phone, which would cost you two bloggies if you lost it.The max video resolution is full HD at 1080p.  This is necessary (to find viewers) to share your video's on youtube, through 3D TV's.  My $600 3DTV looks quite impressive.  Previously you won't notice the sand on the foreground on the beach, but now it's interesting and on your face.  Really you got to have a 3DTV or a 3D monitor, or going to get one soon, otherwise there's no point to it.The LCD screen is much poorer than a high resolution smart phone in 2D (it cost a fraction too).  In 3D it's only purpose is to give you a better idea what you are shooting.  My kids always switch to 2D mode, worrying that the picture taken will be as bad as the screen!  The Nintendo 3DS is better.The maximum 5MP is only available when in 2D mode and in conventional \"square\" mode.  In 3D mode and in wide screen mode you have less resolution.  So resolution wise, it's not even comparable to cheaper cameras.  But since we mostly watch videos and pictures on the HDTV, it's not a problem.I'm used to downgrading quality in exchange for price and features.  I remember my first analog camcorder can shoot under candle lights with beautiful videos.  It was expensive.  When I changed to DV camorders, they shrink the lens and the quality isn't that good.  My last point and shoot has better lens and higher resolution than this.  But my daughter lost it.  We are used to taking shaking video and pictures with the phone so we know we will be satisfied with the bloggie.  It's perfect for touring and family pictures.  Looking back, it's not the resolution, color, fidelity that counts, it's what's in the pictures.  Though when I have thousands to spend I will get a better one that's easy to carry.The distance between the two lens is less than the eyes.  This is not lesser 3D. The 3D video and pictures look natural.  My first estimate is that for shorter lens distance, the 3D effect is \"more\" for nearer objects.  It's not a problem as a normal picture has objects in all distances.  Actually it's a good feature for close up objects, as eye-distance 3D lens have trouble shooting them.When you have two lens, they have to be matched.  So it's understandable that once calibrated in factory, it's expensive to let them move, and even let them zoom digitally.  It's no point to zoom digitally if you have and know how to use an editor, thought it takes time to recode the picture.Once you are used to smart phones and the cams on it, it's a step backwards to use the buttons on the Bloggie.  But you can get use to it.The integrated USB connector is a nice touch.  You can charge, upload anywhere with a USB connector.  You will never forget the wire.  Also, you can just plug it in your TV or Bluray player to be used as a USB drive.The Bloggie use two file types that is not universal - .MPO for 3D pictures and .THM for thumnails of videos.  So your best bet is to use the included Windows software to import (upload) your videos and pictures.  In Linux, you need to batch change these extensions to .jpg in order to upload them standard packages.  MPO is an extra jpg image on a jpg file.  THM has no difference from jpg, just small.The 3D video format is mp4, half side-by-side, compatible with almost all latest 3DTV's.  Few 3DTV's will understand MPO pictures.  To display 3D pictures, I have to convert the pictures to top-bottom (better than side-by-side for passive 3DTV's), and read them via the USB port of the blu-ray player, and set the TV to 3D video mode.  I don't know if the bundled software have something for this.  Though every MPO pictures comes with a separate 2D picture, which is just a copy of the left image.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Neat 3D effect, but just so-so 2D image quality.", "Author": "J.

Martin \"Jeff Punk Rock Martin\"", "ReviewID": "R25NZ1MYM3O01C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say, I'm a little surprised at some of the criticisms of this camera. The name itself - Bloggie - suggests that this little camera is going to have some limits in functionality. It's not going to do everything.But what it CAN do, it does surprisingly well. Most importantly, it shoots very impressive 3D with great resolution...under the right conditions. The 'right conditions' in this case have to do with lighting. Your Bloggie 3D will give you a great picture when you shoot outdoors during the day. It will very good picture shooting indoors with ample light. If you shoot in lower light, you're going to lose resolution. The Bloggie 3D also records sound very well; I've even recorded bands in clubs with great clarity...and a good picture when there's plenty of light on the stage.Of course, the 3D itself is the main selling point of this camera, and it doesn't disappoint. You may notice that the 3D effect is better for objects \"popping\" off the screen than for creating the illusion of objects in the background 'laying back.' I assume that this is because the twin lenses are positioned so close together. Some folks have criticized this, but I see it as a good call on Sony's part. (If you want to shoot 3D for home video, after all, you probably prefer the fun of showing things flying off your TV screen over a more realistic recreation of depth.) I'd rank the 'popping' 3D effect at least on par with that found in current theatrical films. And when watching your 3D videos on a 3D television, you get the added benefit of experiencing 3D with enough light to properly showcase the effect. It also takes nice 3D stills, though the LED light offers only limited lighting for shooting in a dim setting.The videos you shoot on this cam are also (impressively) compatible with YouTube. You can upload your 3D videos via the included Bloggie Software, and YouTube will actually convert them to anaglyph (red/blue) 3D for viewing by friends and relatives. Better still, if you watch Bloggie-created videos through YouTube on an HD 3D TV, the format will be converted to whatever type 3D your TV offers. AMAZING!! You WILL lose some resolution, but...very impressive!UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW!! I mentioned when I first wrote this that my only complaint about this camera was that I hadn't found a way to edit footage in iMovie then get it properly formatted in 3D when uploaded to YouTube. PROBLEM SOLVED! If YouTube doesn't automatically format your 'side-by-side' images, there's a bit of YouTube code you can copy and paste into the \"tags\" box when you upload your video. (This can easily be found in tags from other users' Bloggie 3D videos...and I'm sure you can find it by searching around on YouTube as well.) I have to say, I was happy with this camera even when I thought that, for most users, only raw footage would work in 3D on YouTube. Obviously, this really expands the camera's functionality. You can edit your footage, add music and make your own little 3D movies.Once more, in looking over some of the reviews of this camera, I'm surprised by some of the things other folks have called out as faults. I think any device such as this needs to be looked at for what it's supposed to do...not what you might wish it could do. (Hey, I don't expect it to get up in the morning and make me breakfast!) I can't claim to be a filmmaker of any sort, but I'm an advertising guy and have spent a lot of time in production, working on shooting and editing ads, etc. One thing I've learned is that even with the best equipment, great crew and solid budget, there are ALWAYS limits. Whether you're working with a $100,000 camera or the Sony Bloggie 3D, you have to deal with certain parameters. You have to problem solve, use your imagination and learn to see ANY piece of equipment \"for what it is.\" The bottom line, for me, is that this thing cost me just $250, and I love it! So, as a lifelong 3D fan, I'm going to give it an \"A\" for Amazing.

Whenever I try to open the Bloggie software, I get a message that \"Oops! Google Chrome could not connect to localhost:2468.\" This happens every single time, even if I make my default browser Firefox or try with IE. This seems to be a common problem; search for that message online and you'll come up with some hits for other people with the same problem. What seems to be the official solution is to either a) install it from a different browser, or 2) uninstall Chrome entirely and then install the software. I tried the first, downloading the software utility from the Sony website through Firefox, where I could definitely change my default browser and hope that it would work. Nope, same problem. Still opens up Chrome and gives me the same error message every time I try to open the Bloggie software. That means that my only solution left is to uninstall Chrome entirely to make this software work. Sorry, Sony, but Chrome is my default browser (and it is synced with my Android devices) and uninstalling it would cause me yet another headache just to make your software work. It is unacceptable to have the only solution to installing your software correctly to be that the user has to uninstall his or her browser. What about people with Chromebooks? They can't use this at all? There should be a disclaimer on the packaging that the software does not work with Chrome, or Sony should get its act together and make its software actually work.The camera itself is okay. The 3D is hard to look at on the small screen just because the screen isn't very good quality or maybe it's too small or something, and unfortunately I have no idea what it looks like on the computer since it won't work. For people like me who can't use the Bloggie software, it's possible to get to the camera files by using Windows Explorer; however, if you open up the 3D files they come up as two splitscreen videos, rather than meshing it into one. I can only guess that if the Bloggie software worked it would properly display these so that I could watch them in 3D. You also cannot zoom in 3D; you are stuck with the default zoom level. However, you can zoom in 2D (but not that much) and this works fine. Videos shot in 2D come out normally and are much easier to view on the LCD (and work fine on the computer). The camera can also take still shots by pressing a shutter button along the side (or along the top if the camera is being held sideways). The camera can also zoom in (again, not that much), and the quality is not that great if you zoom in too much. Navigating the \"playback\" area on the camera itself is fairly easy. The files get stored by date, which is actually kind of nice since if you know when a file was taken it makes it really easy to find it quickly. I could not get any videos, even the 2D, to work on my television (which isn't 3D; I just expected that at least the 2D videos would work). The photos displayed fine, but the huge screen only magnified the poor quality.I suppose if you aren't as attached to Chrome or Google as I am then this might be a good choice for you. The 2D camera seems to work okay, but why pay for a 3D camera if you can only use 2D? The 3D, as I said, seems to work fine; it's just not very easy to view it on the LCD screen. If Sony decides to make this compatible with Chrome then I would probably be able to give it a higher rating, as then I presume the 3D would actually be viewable on my computer through the Bloggie software.

Unless you can find a Stereoscopic player on the internet, you are out of luck. I tried playing it with QuickTime and VLC. What I got was a side by side movie of the same thing. No overlapping for the 3D effect.I scoured the Internet for Mac stereoscopic players and came up empty. Maybe you will be more successful in your search. I suggest you find a player before buying this camera if this is your intended purpose.But if you want to send your movie to YouTube or to your 3D TV, then that's another matter. Do a search on YouTube for Bloggie 3D to see examples of the Bloggie 3D output (be sure to have red/blue glasses to get the full effect).What I liked:* Compact size. It is small enough to fit in your pocket.* You can quickly switch between 2D & 3D with a single click of a button.* It works perfectly with my Macintosh computer's Image Capture (so I didn't need to install the software that came with the camera).* It has a black finish that has some texture to it which makes it less likely to slip out of your hand (verses the Bloggy Duo's slick white finish).* It takes really good close-up pictures. I was able to get crystal clear pictures of flowers when the camera was only 4 inches away.* You can record your 2D movies in both landscape and portrait (3D can only be filmed in landscape mode).* You can take a still photo at the same time as recording a 2D video.What I didn't like:* The internal battery. For the occasional or light picture taking, it would be fine. But if you want to take it on a vacation and take a lot of photos - the battery won't last long enough. I take 300 to 500 photos a day and go through 2 sets of AA batteries with my small Samsung camera. There is no way to replace the Bloggie's battery pack if it runs out of power.* The light is just that-a light that you can turn on - not a flash.* Everything is automatic. This could be a plus for those who want to just take a picture, but if you want to do any manual adjustments - you're out of luck, e.g. no setting the ISO, etc.* Limited storage. The Bloggie does not use flash cards. It is all internal flash memory. Once the internal flash memory is full you must stop taking pictures. If you are like me who takes 4000+ photos on vacation - this wouldn't hold everything. The only way around this is to download the photos to a portable computer, erase the Bloggie, and then start again. Doable, but not optimal.BTW: For those that had a problem updating the firmware (taken from an email from Sony): connect the camera to your computer> Two drives appear: BLOGGIE and BLOGGIE_SW> Double-click the icon of the BLOGGIE drive. This is the camera's internal memory> Copy the MHS-FS2.bin file to the camera's internal memory> Drag and drop the icon of the BLOGGIE drive to the Trash icon, and then disconnect the camera from the computer.Sony could have improved this experience by providing the software download or link for a stereographic player so the 3D effect could be observed on a computer.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "3 Years Later Still My Go-To Camera for Concerts", "Author": "L.Gildart", "ReviewID": "R3YNJF99UFL8Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has better sound than anything I've used to shoot outdoor concerts, including my husband's ZOOM.  Period.  Three years later, I am still using it, the battery still holds a charge forever, and there's maybe one scratch in the viewer.Here's the review from 3 years ago:I have (and love) a regular Bloggie. For the price, this camera is definitely a worthwhile upgrade.Set up is super easy. I had the camera up and running in under a minute without looking at the instructions. The one thing that isn't completely intuitive is that you have to turn it on before you hook it up to your computer in order to get your images and movies off it. This is a good feature, because you can plug it in to charge it without having your image software launch all by itself. The timer feature was very easy to figure out - just hit the right side of the rocker and then push the still trigger to start the countdown.The Bloggie Software is okay, not too bloated, and quicker than the Flipshare software I used to use with my Flip camera.The sound quality is excellent. I have recorded a live band (outside) without any clipping. I will update the review as soon as I get a chance to test it indoors. Unlike my other Bloggie, the Bloggie 3D records in stereo, which means that I do not have to use another device to record sound when I shoot video with this one. The high end is not as bright as it could be, and the low end is a smidge muddy, but compared to the iPhone camera videos and most other casual video recorders that get posted to youtube, this sounds pretty good.Image stabilization is just okay. I recommend a tripod, especially if you like to shoot stills while recording video. Otherwise, you'll escape some but definitely not all of the jittery stuff typical of small cameras at this price point, and you'll definitely get swoops and lurches when you hit the still camera trigger. Stills are 5mp - same as an iPhone 4 - probably not professional quality unless you're some kind of wizard, but definitely good enough to document events and what the people you love look like at a given moment in time.The 3d quality is better than you would expect from a camera at this price point. Playback is excellent and hooking it up to a tv is a breeze with the HDMI connector. You can also upload it to youtube and watch it on a regular tv if you have red blue glasses.For me, this device is perfect. I'm a mom, married to a musician, and I need something I can carry in a small purse and use to document school plays, outdoor concerts, and pub gigs. This does everything I need it to do and then some. In one day, I used it to shoot my son's string concert, his karate graduation, and some cool 3D stuff outside an urban fire station. The battery was still going at the end of the day (i'm not sure how long it was on altogether, but battery life was definitely adequate for my purposes.Overall I give the Bloggie 4.5 stars:Ease of set up 5 starsImage quality 4 stars (more like five for the price)Image stabilization 4 starsSound quality 5 starsValue for money 4 stars (I would have given it 5 if they'd included an SD slot)", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "fun camera - some good, some ok", "Author": "M.

At any rate, it took me a little while to figure out how to zoom, play back pictures, etc.  Not a huge thing, but a thing nonetheless.I think overtime 3D cameras will get better as technology improves.

It's tiny- smaller than most point-and-shoot digital cameras- and yet capable of recording up to 4 hours of 1080p 3D video. That's pretty amazing, and says a lot about how both digital video and 3D technology have advanced in the last few years. I've been having great fun with mine, running around the house and the yard, trying to find the most vertigo-inducing images I can, and viewing them- in 3D!- on the built-in LCD.True, the images on the built-in LCD are not exactly HDTV, but it's still pretty impressive to see the images pop out without the need for special viewing glasses, and it's a useful quick check to see what kinds of shots produce the best effects. For real viewing you need to transfer the videos to a TV, a computer, or a web viewing service, like YouTube's experimental 3D viewer. I don't have a 3D HDTV, and don't expect to until prices drop a lot more. Uploading to YouTube takes time. Most of us will do the majority of our viewing on our computers. To this end, Sony provides what looks like an excellent editing and video management program called \"Bloggie\" that loads automatically the first time you plug your camera in to your computer. At least, it's supposed to.According to the supplied documentation, software for both Windows and OSX is installed on the camera as delivered. But when I plugged my camera in to my iMac.... nothing happened. I opened the data folders on the camera, and found Windows software, manuals in a dozen languages, and a sample video- but no OSX software. NO problem, I thought, I'll go to Sony's website. There I found the OSX version of Bloggie as well as updated firmware for the camera. I downloaded both, and updated the firmware with no difficulty. Then I launched the Bloggie installation software.The installer program downloaded updates to the program- odd, as I'd just downloaded it, installed itself, and launched the program. I played with it for a few minutes, shut it down, and went off to shoot some test video. When I returned, and launched \"Bloggie\", it produced an empty window. I played around with it for a while, and then uninstalled and reinstalled it. Same thing- blank window. I again uninstalled it, removed all traces of the program from my machine, downloaded a fresh copy, and ran install again... and still got a blank window.After wasting an hour trying to get Bloggie to work, I tried uploading to YouTube directly from the camera, and that went off without a hitch. YouTube produced a formatting warning message, but the data uploaded perfectly. A quick Google search revealed how to activate the 3D viewer- you add simply add the tag \"yt3d:enable=true\" in the editor. That's it. I dug out my cardboard 3D glasses and was impressed with the quality of the video and the 3D effect. The image stabilization works well, too, though it's not like mounting it on a Steadicam. I'm still hoping I can get the Bloggie program to install and run properly- maybe there's an issue with OSX 10.7- but for the moment I'll be uploading directly to YouTube.For those of you running Windows looking for a cheap way to get started doing 3D video, this little camera is not a bad choice. The Bloggie software is a bit limited in its editing capabilities, but it can do simple cutting and mixing. I'm told there are some hacks for linux coming, too. If, like me, you're running OSX, you have to do more of the work yourself, at least until the software gets sorted out. You can edit using any MP4 compatible  editor; you just won't be able to view your videos until you upload them to YouTube or some other compatible viewer.

It comes with a sample video of a 3D video installed and it's pretty impressive, the colors and the 3D images are outstanding but the ones that I take don't look like that at all. I can tell that it's not your normal video, there is an aspect of depth to the images but nothing like the pre-recorded video. I find myself saying yes, oh, I think I can tell it's 3D and not being blown away by it like I expected after viewing the installed sample. If you don't have another 3D viewing device such as a TV or other then you will be stuck  only being able to view the 3D technology on the recorder itself. I'm not sold on 3D technology, I just read an article that said that 3D TVs have just been a fad and are on their way out the door so buy with caution, you don't want to spend alot of money on an item that you may not be able to view the videos on anything.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simple entry into 3D video and 3D photography.  A fun toy, at a very fair price.", "Author": "S. Power", "ReviewID": "R1J5B2MFKDCZZI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Now that cell phones have such good cameras in them, and high quality compact cameras and SLRs have come down in price so much, there isn't really a need for this camera.  Only its 3D capability differentiates it from what most cell phones can now do, and its performance is well short of an SLR or modern compact.  That said, its ability to record 3D video is impressive, and the novelty of 3D is a lot of fun.  Putting videos up on YouTube3D is more fun than I ever imagined.Pros:- High quality 3D recording that looks great on a 3D HDTV or computer.- Very simple and easy to use interface.- Solid battery life and simple charging over USB (though not removable).- 3D screen that isn't great, but does the job.- Tripod attachment.- Very fair price considering how well it performs.- 8GB of memory (though not user removable or upgradeable).-Cons:- Screen quality is lacking.- No image stabilization.  Plan to use a tripod or set the camera on a hard surface.- Not as simple to share pictures and videos as other devices.  You have to be willing to take some time with the files.- Doesn't include 3D glasses.  You should order some red/blue glasses when you order these, to view 3D on your computer, unless you have an 3DTV with active shutter glasses already.- Microphones are slightly muddy.  Not terrible, but not as good as on most cameras.I recommend this camera if you are looking for a cheap and easy way to experiment with 3D.  I you just want a \"Flip\" style camera and don't care about 3D, I would look into upgrading your cell phone or getting an iPod Touch, since the cameras on those types of devices that you have with you anyway are as good as what is in this.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "An Expensive Toy", "Author": "Brenda Frank \"Eclectic Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R3QFOT8N0NTZ05", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Bloggie 3d is a neat idea and a fun novelty but not a serious camera. At first glance, this camera is small, light and feels sturdy. These are big bonuses for a camera, especially if it is intended for kids.You absolutely shouldn't get this if you do not have a 3d TV, glasses and supporting HDMI cables.  The 3D LCD screen is just about useless due to its tiny size and the ability to provide headaches in 3D mode. The 3D thing gets pretty old within the first few uses. It just isn't practical.The regular HD videos have come out nicely, though. I have shot several and had no problems using the sharing features provided with the bloggie software.  The programs allow for very simple sharing across a multitude of social media programs. They also look decent on a larger screen. As far a low light shooting goes, don't bother trying it. There are no settings to adjust to allow for this and no flash of any kind.  This is a huge deterrent to buying any camera in my mind since 99% of cell phones now come with LEDs. There are a few other things about this camera that bother me including the non-removable battery, internalized memory and the dedicated sharing/charging USB port. In my opinion, these limit this camera to a toy and definitely not something you should buy for serious recording. If you are purchasing this for a kid, I could see it being a great first video camera and it getting a lot of use.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor Video In Both 2D/3D", "Author": "Chadman88", "ReviewID": "RIX1U9R49XLZY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This video camera was a great concept and turned out to be just that.  The 2D and 3D video was very poor.  The video is very grainy in lower light situations and you must hold very still in order to capture video that is not jittery, jerky and blurry.  While I feel the 3D video (ghosting was seen during playback on 2 different 3D TV's) was far better than the 2D video, it does not live up to the CES 2011 hype.  My Droid phone takes better video.

The 2D HD video is however a little better, the video image is ok. The 2D image is clear and bright but be aware, this camera has no features such as image stabilazation so with any movement, the video quality decreases tremendously. Although there was a lack of features with this camera the only purpose form me buying this camera was for 3D. There is still virtually no 3D content available for 3D hdtv so I bought this camera just to be able to watch some 3d content... the 3D performance of this Camera was good...(for the 3weeks that it worked).... yes i bought this camera as soon as it became availabe and i only owned if for 3 weeks and now it will not power on.. i contacted customer support and they do not have a resolution for this. I told the support tech the camera does not power and then to troubleshoot, the tech asked to try powering on the camera...(retarded)lol... once it didnt turn on they decided it needs to be serviced, which means i need to mail the phone to Texas for who knows how long.... not worth the headache, returning this piece of garbage is easier.
