{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One fantastic camera", "Author": "R. Dege", "ReviewID": "R1245U0OUUC2RI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: image quality, shutter speed, amazing zoom, fast power on, lots of advanced features, etc. etc.  The technical specs, and performance of this camera far exceeded any expectations that I could have expected from a pocket-sized camera.Cons (All minor):1) Charging requires the removal of the battery from the camera, and it being inserted into a separate battery charger.  I'm accustomed to my old sony camera, where it charges in it's own cradle.2) The power button itself requires some precision to activate.  It's not difficult, or annoying to use, but again, I'm comparing it to my older sony camera, where it was a quick, simple flip.3) The menuing system can be somewhat daunting to a new or novice user.  Depending what mode your camera is in will change what menu options you're presented with.  Using the camera && reading the manual will help with the familiarity process.4) The spin dial (or whatever it's called).  I have yet to see what benefit this dial has over the conventional directional pad.  It's almost like a double-edged sword.  On the one hand, it's quite helpful when you want to quickly flip through photos you've taken on the camera.  On the other hand, it becomes challenging when trying to change scenes in scene mode, or when changing functions in the manual mode.Overall, I love this camera.  I bought it just before going on vacation, and was continually amazed by the quality of the photos and shutter speed performance throughout the trip.  While traveling on a tour bus, I was able to take crystal clear photos of the countryside landscape, while the bus was traveling at about 60mph.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very nice", "Author": "BED \"BED\"", "ReviewID": "RAFSGJ9TASHFV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a Big fan of Canon products-(own a Canon Powershot Pro S5 and 20D), so you can understand why I was a bit shy about this purchase-wanting convenience without risking quality.  I elected to try the Canon SD890IS because of the 10M with 5X Optical.  Some talk about the surface getting \"dinged\" up but what's happening to mark their equipment so badly?  This small but wonderful camera has all the quality and capability of  my Canon Powershot Pro S5, with the exception of shooting as well in low light, but even that is not bad.  And remember the reasons you purchased an elph. Others brands may have higher mega pixels, but comparing this camera with it's one slight short fall that I noticed, it out shines the other brands in low light shooting capability, does better with noise problems, and macro capability!

If you are looking for quality, ease of use, than consider the Canon SD890IS.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Comparing Canon PowerShot Digital ELPH cameras", "Author": "Julie Neal", "ReviewID": "R4JTMYQKEPU6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a travel writer I spend a lot of time at Walt Disney World, and Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs are the most common cameras I see. Families seem to love them, because they're so easy to carry and operate. About the size of a deck of playing cards, each of these \"pocket cameras\" really do slip right into a pants pocket, and their rectangular designs make them easy to grip. Best of all, they all take good photos. (How do I know? Because I've actually gotten to use every one of these models. Nearly every day guests ask me to take photos of them with their own cameras, which most often are Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs.)Here's my breakdown of the ten bestselling Digital Elph models. Any of the first six are superb choices:1ST PLACE: SD1100 ISAn update to the SD1000 (see below), this 2008 8MP beauty adds image stabilization, a slightly longer zoom (38-114 mm), another MP of photo size and a small indent on the right side for a better grip. Plus it comes in colors! My daughter has a blue one and uses it every single day. During school days the image stabilization made a real difference in her on-the-bus shots. With that heavy of use hers has gotten scratched up a bit, but the marks are small and hardly noticeable.2ND PLACE: SD870 ISThe ELPH to buy if you want a wide-angle lens. Slightly thicker than the SD1100 IS, this 8MP model doesn't have an optical viewfinder which makes it tough to use in bright sunlight, otherwise there's little not to love. My husband uses one as a comp camera, to compose shots for the travel guide \"The Complete Guide to Walt Disney World.\"3RD PLACE: SD770 ISJust released in May, this 10 MP model is, in a way, an update of the SD1100 IS (see above). I rate it lower because it costs about $50 more and doesn't come in colors. On the other hand, it has a longer battery life than the 1100 and features an improved LCD screen that is very easy to view. As for photo quality, I can't tell the difference.4TH PLACE: SD950 ISThere's a lot to like in this 12.1 MP camera. First off, it's gorgeous. The body, though a little thick, is titanium. An upgrade to the SD850 IS (see below), it has a 3.7x zoom lens and adds manual controls as well as the ability to stitch together panoramic images. The only reason I don't rate it higher is the price.5TH PLACE: SD890 IS (The camera on this page)Want a long zoom lens? Here's your baby, a 2008 10 MP model with a 5x zoom. Also has the new bright LCD screen and all the other 2008 Canon goodies. The most expensive Canon PowerShot ELPH.6TH PLACE: SD790 ISWith the same 10 MP image sensor and 3x zoom lens as the SD770 IS, this 2008 model stands out only for its larger 3-inch LCD display and, as a result, lack of optical viewfinder. The rear controls are different, too, with a flatter design that uses fewer buttons.7TH PLACE: SD1000In my opinion there's no reason to buy this 7.1 MP model. Released in 2007, it's been replaced by the SD1100 IS (see above). The SD1000 is a fine camera but it doesn't have image stabilization, a key feature of the 2008 lineup.8TH PLACE: SD850 ISThe ancestor to the SD890 IS, this 8 MP Elph combines a 4x zoom and 8 MP photo size with an image stabilizer. Every button, dial and switch has a quality feel. Slighter larger than the other models here, it is a little tougher to pop in and out of your pocket, but if you have larger hands it may be just what you are looking for.9TH PLACE: SD800 ISThis 7.1 MP predecessor to the 870 doesn't focus well at its edges when set at its widest angle. Unless it's priced really cheap, get the 870 instead.10TH PLACE: SD750The 2007 PowerShot flagship offers a light meter that adjusts for facial brightness, 17 shooting modes, some first-rate movie features and red-eye correction -- features that were innovative a year ago but are common in Canon's latest models. No image stabilization; no optical viewfinder. Choose a 2008 model instead.", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Two significant problems with an otherwise nice camera!", "Author": "D.

I agree with most of the rave reviews about this camera, but I have TWO IMPORTANT CAVEATS that don't seem to appear.1st: The orientation of the LCD polarization on the screen is such that when using the camera with polarized sunglasses, you can't see an image on the LCD (in the standard,  horizontal position). For every other LCD camera I've used the screen is 100% viewable with polarized sunglasses. The blanking out of the screen only occurs when you rotate the camera 90 degrees (to the vertical orientation).2nd: There is CONSIDERABLE \"Barrel distortion\" when using this long 5x optical zoom lens in the standard mode.Please note: I've contacted Canon Customer Service and they say both issues are not fixable and expected given the design of the camera (UGH!)", "Date": "July 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good little camera packed with great features", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R273JP8YAM2XLE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before I picked this camera; every site recommended cannon. Sony, casio all had picture problems. I picked this camera because it has a 5x optical zoom, low light feature, compactness, and the buttons are not close to one another so easy to use if you have big fingers.Camera is loaded with features but not all are easy to get to if you have big hands that is my one downside of this camera. Changing to some manual setting can be a challenge and finding where to review pictures as well.  Did not think I would like the face detection feature but I was pleasntly surprized, it does a great job find the face except if you have sunglasses on. The faces come out great in the picture; 10 MP may be an overkill but I like sometimes like to crop and enlarge  certain parts of the picture and hanve 10 MP makes sure the picture is not grainy.  Lastly night pictures without the flash come out good not excellent but very good;although it does take a min to change all of the settings for low light mode.

I have a Canon XT also and multiple lenses and do a lot of amateur photography. We have been really happy with our Canon equipment. It's not as flashy with all the bells and whistles of some of the other manufacturers but the quality is good and the firm reliable.We were going to Italy and France for two weeks and I didn't want to lug around all the XT lenses.  We were determined to both carry laptops but NOT check luggage and so really needed to minimize the camera equipment. We would be on planes, trains, buses and partly on foot (we stayed three nights in Careno, Italy, a pedestrian only village in Lake Como).I searched through the various Elphs and picked this one for the 5x zoom and image stabilization features. We carried along the camera's USB cord to download photos to the laptop, an extra battery and the battery charger and that was it. Oh, a little plug adapter for European wall plugs (the battery charger works in Europe so you don't need a converter, just the wall adapter). The setup is much like earlier Elphs so the learning curve was easy. I didn't discover until quite late that there was a wide-angle option on the camera and wished I had realized that earlier.We took almost 1,000 photos with in on the trip. The quality of the photos is great, and the ability to slip the camera into a pocket such a plus. We'll be carrying this little baby along on other trips and I'll save the big one for stationary visits.", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased with Camera and Amazon", "Author": "G.

I found out about the new SD890IS but couldn't find anyone who had it available online or in a retail store within 120 miles of me. Google pointed me to Amazon who I would not have thought of for buying a camera, and not only did they have it in stock, but for less than the cost of gas, plus not having to waste a day traveling, I had the camera within 24 hours. It was also $50 cheaper than the online sites who had it on back order. I'm very pleased with the camera which has all the features of my old one, plus 5X optical and 10MP which is an upgrade from the 4X & 6MP of the SD700IS. Both Macro and Telephoto images are very impressive for a camera small enough to be constantly carried around with me on my belt. It has a large enough selections of modes to handle most situations. I also like it's movie capabilities. At a commencement exercise a couple of weeks ago I was able to get some surprisingly decent pictures under the circumstances without using a flash, because I was able to use a very high ISO and could match the type of available indoor lighting.

I have taken pictures that are just as good as some top SLR cameras.  The on-off button is a little small and it makes a scratching noise when you zoom, but those are minor problems.

The zoom function RADICALLY loses focus the farther you zoom.  The manual does address both these issues, but doesn't solve them, just states they are there.  My basic photos of family turned out very nicely, but my close up foliage shots, zoomed shots, sunsets, etc were not as good as would be expected, especially since I was using a tripod for many of these shots.

After reading a few reviews on Amazon and other camera websites, I took the plunge and paid $349.99 for it.  It went down to about $306 within the first 30 days of purchase, and Amazon refunded me the difference from the $349.99.This camera takes EXCELLENT photos!  There is a bit of a learning curve, but the book is very helpful.  The 5X zoom is great, and the macro is superb.  I bought the high-power flash to accompany it, and I feel like I'm set for any situation.  The image stabilization is also fantastic.  I took photos of a train moving south while we drove north and still got great pics.  You know how hard it is with kids sometimes, but this camera captures them well.People have complained a bit about the on/off button, but it's just a matter of getting used to.

Much heavier than the SD700, same zoom, buttons not as convenient, very good picture quality... basically as close to the SD 700 as you can get with all the Elphs that are out there.

BURNHAM \"Still Stitching\"", "ReviewID": "R2EF395GOLEE7E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using this camera for about 4 months. This is the 4th (digital) Canon I have purchased, preceded by a rebel and two elph models for family members. The two features that led me to select this are the 5x zoom and the viewfinder. I don't find the viewfinder to be particularly accurate for framing the picture. On the other hand, I don't find the screen to be a particularly accurate rendering of colors or focus. You usually don't have time to fiddle back and forth, after fiddling with the other scene, flash, etc. Go with one and just keep taking pics until you find the balance and focus you like. It's not like you are wasting film.There are two things that really annoy me about this camera and prevented me from giving it 5 stars. One is the long delay between pushing the button and actually taking the picture. For example, a child or animal will probably move before the camera actually takes the shot, unless they are asleep or focused on something else. Part of it is red eye reduction, but even when you turn off flash, it is still way too long. Kind of like make an appointment to snap the shutter. The other frustration is the outer ring on the navigation control (not the top wheel, the one that changes scene or selects flash). I find I have to spin that thing around a lot before it actually changes the selection and then it may change by 1, 2 or even three options. So you are spinning the stupid wheel back and forth back and forth just to -- say -- turn off the flash so the cat won't turn it's head while you are waiting for the camera to actually take the picture. Cat gets up and leaves. So you need to make those changes in advance before you even start framing. And that means you need to learn the camera quirks so you know it's limits in advance.The general setting minus flash is good for most pics. The night and indoor options are pretty good as well, minus flash. The flash is what you would expect, pretty short distance, so it is nice that the camera can still take many pictures without it, given adequate ambient light.There is substantial barrel distortion at 5x, but I expect that with a camera this small. With the good resolution, cropping is an option.It does have a rather odd algorithm for selecting what it wants to focus on when people are not the subject or there are a lot of other subjects around. It seems to want to find something in the foreground - anything, instead of using the obvious high contrast horizon.  An old fashioned \"infinity\" setting would be nice then you could use the older canon feature of using one area to represent light, contrast balance and then changing the view to something else. When it doesn't find a match in those little boxes, it isn't happy.My camera makes some really weird almost grinding sounds and the lens spends a lot of time trying to find focus when I am in the 4 to 5x range. Makes the same sound when I turn it off, too. Not sure if that is normal. Again, the time to set up the shot and actually take the shot is too long for a point and shoot camera. More like shoot and point, if you get my drift. In that respect, I like the SD600 more.Nice camera, generally a decent balance of features, function and the physical constraints of the design.

It is very simple to use and has a LOT of features that you can play with to create great creative images.I like the fact that it has an optical viewfinder.  The optical viewfinder is very useful when you are outdoor and the sun is bright.  It will be very hard to view ANY LCD screen in this condition.  Because it has the optical viewfinder, the LCD screen is slightly smaller than most of its competitors; it only has 2.5\" compared to 3\" on some other cameras.The slight UI issue that I have is the LAG that the wheel has.  If you turn it too slow, it does not change the option or change the option VERY slowly.  But, if you turn the wheel too fast, there is a LAG before the option changes.  So, sometimes, you need to go back and forth a few times to get to the option that you want.Oh yeah...  The multiple frames shot is only available WITHOUT flash.

Unlike every other canons I've owned and worked with, this one is a loser.Yes, I can coax reasonable pictures if I use the non-auto modes and force the iso settings to be something appropriate, but for something which should be able to take a good pic of grandma when you flip it on, it misses the mark.As of 2/2/2009, canon doesn't list firmware updates, so I'm stuck with this thing being near uselesss indoors for the time being.", "Date": "February 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "A Significant Flaw", "Author": "Bruce C.

But public sentiment didn't support the pricing, and consequently the 890 is going for less than the SD880, which came out at a hundred less than the 890 but is now commanding 50 more.  The reason? The 890 uses an entirely plastic body, which makes it stand out in shape and style from the rest of the Canon SD line, giving it a plumpish, \"squat-like\" appearance compared to the classic Canon box-like design.  The 880 costs more and has a less powerful zoom, but its key components are metal.  If the 880 is still too pricey for you, Steve's Cameras recommends the SD770 over the 890, remarking that the LCD screen of the latter proved scratch-prone, but don't expect to find a 5-power zoom for less than the current asking price for the 890.", "Date": "February 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Out of the box AMAZING!", "Author": "Richard Sarno", "ReviewID": "R3JABX0W5J3DYU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a 20D as well, but i like to keep a pocket camra for quick and easy use.

It has a handful of modes to play around with (the color swap is my personal favorite). Very nice, clean looking finish. Its compact, yet for its size, it doesn't feel flimsy at all. Its a bit heavier than it looks, which is better for maintaining a steady hand while shooting. However this really isn't an issue with this camera since it has image stabilization, a must for Starbucks fanatics. It also comes with the tried, tested, and true optical view-finder, handy when in a battery pinch. The shutter speed is fine, hardly any delay at all. Once you turn it on, you'll never miss a moment. The main appeal of this camera however is its 5X zoom function. Of course it is still a compact point-and-shoot, but the function works better than expected from a camera of this price range, i.e. crisp zoom shots, although occasionally a bit blurry at max. Well, I don't mean to cheapen it, it really provides some amazing results. On a side note, for some reason I can't help but feel a bit more macho every time I zoom in to take a shot and my lens protrudes more than any other camera around...I don't know why.The only major flaw this camera has, which is far from fatal, is its generic looking/feeling on/off button. Yes, this minor imperfection still deserves its own paragraph and a star as well. First of all, for a button that holds such great importance, it is quite illusive. It took me fifteen seconds to find it, and once I did, I sort of wish I hadn't. Its made of cheap plastic that illuminates a hideous green when powered on. It really stands out as the only blemish on this fine piece of technology. Interesting choice for Canon to do such a thing on a camera this high up in their point-and-shoot ranks. Maybe they should have included some sort of stylus type thingy for us to poke around with. Sometimes I fear that I won't be able to turn the camera on in time for that classic shot, and that when I do manage to maneuver my pinky just right, I might not be able to ever power it off again.

It takes great pictures and is easy to use once you do a little exploration of the menu system.  It has one minor problem, mentioned by others, and that is the polarization of the LCD screen.  You can't see it with polarized sunglasses on in some orientations (at first I thought the screen had gone dead until I figured out what was going on).  However, unlike some other models this one has an optical viewfinder, which is often easier to use in bright sun (when you have your sunglasses on) than the LCD.  To me that is a must-have item.  I've also found that in some cases the best use of your polarized sunglasses is to take them off your head and hold them in front of the lens.  I got some great shots of manatees at Blue Springs SP in Florida that way.  Without the sunglasses in front of the lens the reflection off the water partially obscured the subject.

Anyone using this camera mainly for snap shots will not see a difference between 12 megapixel and 10 megapixel photos because 10 is already really great quality.Picture quality is very crisp on any mode (auto or manual). I've taken lots of action shots both in daylight and night time on auto mode and I never get blurry pictures. If you compare with a Nikon coolpix, you will get blurry action shots on auto mode. So if you want a point and shoot camera that will get every shot with no fuss, then this is the camera for you.  It's also got a lot of advanced features and I do find myself tinkering around in the manual modes.Camera is fairly light weight and the 5x optical zoom is fantastic. Digital zoom is amazing for a camera this size and price point. I also like that this has an optical view finder for times when you want to save the battery or if you just like to use this feature. But battery life is very long (I've taken pictures all afternoon and then all evening until 2am and the battery didn't even go into the low zone). Takes 2 hours or less to fully recharge the battery and the charger is very portable/light weight. I did buy a spare battery from a generic brand (just make sure that you match the specs of the canon battery instead of getting a generic with less \"juice\").Here are the only CONS that I see with this camera:- Many reviewers have noted this, so I must repeat that the power on/off button is a bit difficult to finess if you don't have nails or nimble fingers (ie, probably not the best for a man). I don't have an issue with it, but if you think that you might, then all the other canon models have the traditional power button on the top of the camera. Personally, a slightly difficult power button is a small trade off for the perks of this camera and how superior it is to others in the same price point.- Small size and rounded edge is a bit hard for a man to handle comfortably without needing to be conscious of where his fingers are (not over flash, etc.)- Can't see LCD screen when wearing polarized sunglasses; however, there is an optical view finder. I've taken pics all summer with this camera, all the while wearing polarized sunglasses, and I haven't found this to be a hassle, but you might.- In general, Canon's menus and features are not the most intuitive. I've had 2 previous canon digital cameras so I'm familiar with the layout and workings of it. Manual is decent at walking you through what the icons mean and how to adjust things. But if you are a digital camera novice or want something very straight-forward and intuitive, then don't get a Canon. Look for a less expensive camera from Nikon - you will sacrifice a bit on picture quality, but the menus will be more user friendly.", "Date": "July 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "John H.

Lakdawalla", "ReviewID": "R35AXKSMZMDMBU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently had to upgrade from my Canon Powershot SD550 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Beige) after subjecting it to more abuse than any electronic device should be expected to survive.  (Amazingly, it was only the flash that failed after I dropped the camera on a hard floor for the Nth time; everything else on the camera continued to work just fine.)  I did call Canon to see if repair was a possibility.  Although they would repair it, it would cost me at least a hundred bucks, and when I remarked that that was nearly the price of a new one, they informed me that I could use their customer loyalty program, in which you trade in your old camera for a new model at a price much lower than the same model is sold at on Amazon (I got the 890IS for $150).  These are factory refurbished cameras, from returns or mis-orders, but I've always had good experiences buying factory refurbished computers and thought it was worth a shot.  The new camera arrived by FedEx 2-day delivery -- just as quick as Amazon Prime -- and included a prepaid label for me to ship back the broken 550.  So I was never without a camera, which was great, since this all unfolded the day my daughter was born.  The 890 did arrive with an absurdly tiny SD card but I was able just to use the card I'd had in my 550, fortunately.The 890 IS has a nearly unchanged interface from the 550, which is good because the interface on these Canon cameras is very intuitive and easy to use.  The one major change is this: on the 550, there was a dial to turn to select auto mode, manual mode, camera mode, or photo playback.  On the 890, the photo playback feature has been removed from that dial, and is now toggled via a separate button on the back of the camera.  The advantage to this change is that you don't lose any settings you may have set up in manual mode if you want to review your photos, which is very nice.  It took me a while to figure out that if the camera is powered off, you can press and hold the playback button for a few seconds and it'll just power on the screen without extending the barrel, so you can review shots quietly.Another noticeable improvement over the 550 is the warmup time -- it's incredibly quick, ready for action as soon as you've turned it on and positioned it to shoot.All in all, the 890 is just another in a long line of Canon's fantastic little cameras -- very small, easy to use, producing crisp, beautiful images, allowing the user a decent amount of control over features like flash, focus, and continuous shuttering.

Finally my S50 got stolen, so I had to find a new one.I spent a lot of time looking around at different options (mostly focused on Canon).  The other brands I looked at did not have the combination of greater than 4x optical zoom and a viewfinder (for when it is too sunny to see the LCD).  Also the other Canon models did not fit what I wanted.I needed a small camera that would easily fit in my pants pocket (so I could have it with me almost all the time).  I needed something with better than average optical zoom.  I'm often wanting to take pictures of animals, waves, surfing, etc that require more than 3x optical zoom.As always the more megapixels the better.  So after much searching, this was the obvious choice for the camera that I needed.  I had found the camera at a number of shops in Peru while I had been traveling and looking at options.  But when I came back to the US to make my purchase, I couldn't find the camera anywhere.  I checked Circuit City, Best Buy, Walmart, Sam's, and many other local shops.  They all had the typical 3x zoom standard models, but never the SD890IS.I had to travel the next day so there was no time for me to order online.  I finally ended up driving an hour to Sam's Club in another city to get it.  What a pain.Since getting the camera I have been nothing but pleased.  We just took it to the Bahamas and took over 625 shots with it.  I am so impressed with the Image Stabilizing (IS) feature.  Many times I was moving (on a boat or something) or got bumped (in a crowd) right as the picture went off, but the pictures all came out just perfectly!  I didn't really consider this feature much when searching for cameras, but it has become one of my favorite things out this camera.The zoom is exactly what I needed.  I was able to capture so many more great shots with it.  Also the IS feature makes the digital zoom actually usable.  My old S50 had to be on a tripod (or rock) to take a decent photo with the digital zoom.I was able to get some crazy pictures with the combo of these features.  Things like the bar code numbers off of a soda can from someone across the park.  I was even able to read them on the LCD of the camera.I couldn't have chosen a better camera.

I have not been disappointed with the results. The 10 meg picture quality is very good and I really have no need for higher resolution since I no longer print pictures at home. I have had some printed on line through both Walgreen's and Shutterfly. Both services report I could print well over the 8 by 10 print sizes I have had done. The print quality in both 5 by 7 and 8 by 10 are equal. The Image stability seems to work well since I have taken a lot fewer blurry pictures with this camera.The camera has a nice feel and the shape makes it easy to hold. I prefer using a view finder so the capability to turn off the view screen played a big part in my choice. Camera came with a nice \"printed\" instruction book besides the stuff on the included cd. books seem to pretty rare these days with electronic cameras. The camera does take some learning and having an instruction with you in the field can't be understated. I am sure once the camera is fully learned the book wont seem as important. I do usually travel with more than one camera so this certainly helps me.I am very satisfied with the battery life and picture capacity. I bought a spare battery and two Transcend 4 GB SDHC cards when I bought the camera.My only gripe about the camera is the Power on/off button. Not only is it hard to operate correctly it seems to take a while for the camera to turn on. Fortunately there is an alternate way to power up the camera so I find I use the Power button mostly to turn the camera off.This camera was on sale when I bought it and a newer version was also available.

It takes great pictures and has an amazing range of options to make perfect picture taking easy.  I previously had a Sony camera which also took really good pictures, but had a long delay before it actually took a picture.  It also would flash twice if you were taking a picture that required flash.  I suppose it had to do with the auto focus and red eye reduction, but nevertheless it was really annoying.  Because I mostly use my camera to take pictures of my children, I felt I was losing a lot of great moments due to this delay.  Also when I was taking pictures of adults they would often move after they saw the first flash because they thought the picture had been taken.  But this Canon camera does not do either of these things and it makes taking great pictures so easy!  I've also taken some terrific videos.

I've had a couple of Canon Powershot cameras before and always been pleased, but this time I was looking for something with a little more zoom power.  The 5x Optical Zoom on this pocket-size camera makes a BIG difference from my former 3x zooms!  Now, when I want to take a picture of that sailboat way out on the ocean with the sun setting behind it... you can actually see the sailboat in nice, crisp detail!  My pictures have come out fantastic with good clarity and color.Another feature I really appreciate about this camera is the viewfinder.  A lot of the pocket-size cameras are now getting rid of the viewfinder feature as they enlarge the size of their screen.  I have found that it is still a huge plus to have a viewfinder on those sunny days when your screen is whited out from the sun.Two negatives (and neither are dealbreakers):1) The camera has oddly rounded edges which makes it a little bit tippy if you are trying to do a hands-free 10-second timer picture.  It also makes the camera a little bit slippery to hang onto, so I always use the provided wrist strap.2) The on/off button is tiny and inset, making it difficult to turn on and off.  I have little fingers so it's not much of a problem for me, but I would imagine this could be a struggle for someone with large fingers!Altogether , I highly recommend this camera.  It is compact to fit in your pocket, takes great pictures with good zoom & color.  Except for in that weird half-lit indoor lighting, the shutter speed is fast.  What more to say?

Because of the tough economic times, we now have only two full-time photographers and we cover a big area. The real photogs, of course, use these $5,000 cameras. But using my Canon Powershot, about 1/25 of that price, I'm also able to shoot photos that not only can run as the main package but get great shots. It even does well with baseball, where often you have to focus on the batter when the big play happens at second base. With the Powershot, you can whisk the camera from home to second and it'll autofocus in that instant and get you that shot. With a dense-photo setting (M or L), you can be zoomed way out and still get a quality shot because then you can crop in on that dense photo and it won't be grainy. Just keep the telephoto lens clean -- otherwise it can get stuck easily -- and don't be tempted to throw the sleek little camera in your pocket without a case.

Well, point-and-shoot seems to be obvious choice. SD890 IS is not the best looking one, but it's a save choice. We have another SDxxx that my wife gave it to her mother. It works well after 5 years. So, in this sample space, Canon is reliable. And this is the main reason I bought this SD890 IS.Issue with len: problem shows up after one and half years, when it's out of warranty. Reverse motor doesn't work so len can't be draw back. So long for Canon reliability to me. I don't want to blame Canon specifically for that. Just one lesson on product perception.Things I like: Compact, good battery life, picture is clear (a little subjective here), and use SD card (can't believe some vendors refuse to use SD, my laptop has SD slot).Things I don't like: outlooking, key button feeling, and small LCD.Suggestion for future buyers: It's still a save choice, relatively since I don't see much complain online on SD890 IS len issue.

I come from the old school where you didn't hold the camera away and use the LCD panel, but looked through a viewfinder.  I've always felt that that gave you steadier shots.  I also think it preserves battery life. Plus, I'm getting at that age where I have to move things further from my eyes to be able to see them.

The flash setting in automatic mode are only flash and no flash.  To have the camera flash all the time, which is nice on sunny days for fill, you need to have the camera in manual setting.  Not to great.  I really dislike the control dial, in manual settings.  You need to go slow the have the dial stop where you wish.  It also takes way too long to get it to move at all. I like the 10mp and 5 x optical zoom.  The camera takes great pictures, but some of the Manuel functions are easier to use in my SD800IS.  If you are never going to take the camera off automatic, this is a great camera. The red eye in camera removal.  In my opinion, that is a waste.  It is easy to do in any free software, example, Picasa.This camera uses the same batteries as my SD800IS.  Nice, since my husband will use the SD800IS.I wish Canon would ask what customers like and don't like.  That is why I am writing this review.  This is my 3rd point and shoot Canon.

Caroe \"Ed\"", "ReviewID": "R2KDHH6Z6I0D4G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I shot only Canon cameras for business for 40+ years. Now retired, when not carrying my Rebel SLR digital bodies & various IS lenses for max. capability but loads of weight, I hang my SD890IS and SD800IS in belt-cases and leave the big stuff home. Both are great, but best for different type shots. IS and optical eye viewer are essential. Both shoot far better short movies than any camera-phone too.The 7.1 mega pixels (on SD800IS) are far more than needed, even for 5-foot blow-ups from \"raw files\" or extreme cropping; 10 mega pixels (on SD890IS) is over-kill even for slow night shots, but doesn't cost extra.Differences: SD890IS has the longest available (on PowerShot) 6.6 to 33.0 mm zoom, 5X optical zoom; 15X w. digital zoom. Best for birds, critters, shots you will spoil by getting close, like your little kids playing who don't see you, and action you can't get close to like field sports; also people head shots from across the room.SD800IS has an unusually wide 4.6 to 17.3 mm zoom, 3.8 optical zoom, plus digital zoom to 15X - which I try never to use on any digital camera; better to shoot \"larger file settings\" and crop later. So the wider angle SD800IS is far better for quick, casual group shots at crowded parties, as well as where max. depth of field is needed to get sharp near distance plus sharp way-off subjects. BEST advantage: both have the same multi-settings, so by learning settings on the 890 you know the 800 settings. Both use the same type battery/charger & flash card. (Both now have been replaced by newer, not better, models.) Wide ranging picture opportunities happen fast. With both 890 & 800 I can grab the one that's best for that shot.CAUTION: \"Point & Shoot\" mentality is wrong. Each model Canon PowerShot camera really is at least a dozen fantastic, different-special-purpose, computer-controlled cameras. It is almost criminal not to allow for a 3 to 4+ hour study session with camera-&-user guide. Then take a lot of practice shots to learn and evaluate; do it again a few more times over 6-months when you don't absolutely need the pics. To really utilize these tiny Canon gems well, YOU must learn well past the \"full auto point-&-shoot\" setting that yields very good, but far from best possible, pictures.", "Date": "August 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "penngal03 \"penngal03\"", "ReviewID": "R2KGOG1II0AV35", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes great pictures and is really easy to use.
