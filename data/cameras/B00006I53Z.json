Put a fast lens on it and I seriously doubt any of today's camera will focus any faster. Just a touch on the shutter button and 45 points come into action and in AI SERVO MODE it is impossible to loose your subject.

Yes the MP is low, however the image quality is superb. This camera surpasses any rebel out there and still out performs other high end models in many ways. If you are starting to get serious about photography, do your homework and you will realize that there is much more to photography than MP. Let's face it, if you are looking at anything less than a 5D, then you probably aren't making any real money on your photos. And if you don't plan on printing any posters, take a chance on a camera which can show you what performance is really about. Otherwise, keep taking your generic pictures and enjoy your 100 gigs of useless photos filling up your hard drive. If you are looking for some sample images taken with the 1D, check out the Canon EOS 1D group on Flickr.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for a backup camera!", "Author": "MARC Schwartz \"shutter bug\"", "ReviewID": "R1JXWROFR3IXEO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own an EOS  50D and I bought the EOS-1D as a backup for it. While the 50D has many features not incorporated into the 1D, its solid body and ruggedness make it purfect as a backup. The newer EF-S lenses will not work with the 1D, however, the rest do.

Is it worth $1,500 probably not, but then I paid $450 for my G9.  This is one awesome camera and you need to experience it to know how great it is.

It has features that no other camera can beat, even today (2013).First of all, it has only 4 MP spread across an APS-H sensor.  Which means that this camera has clean low noise from ISO 200-1600.  It also focuses very quickly and shoots at 8 frames per second in raw (tiff) format.I have a Canon 20D and after using this baby for a couple of hours there is no way I can go back.  I'm too spoiled.  The professional controls, the extra large, bright viewfinder...this is like driving a Rolls Royce and my 20D is a Camry.The quality of the images off this camera can only be described as \"special\".  Maybe it's the low pixel ratio to the size the sensor, I don't know.  As I was learning the camera and messing around in my kitchen I took two awesome portraits that just blew people's minds when I posted them on Facebook.  The depth, color rendition and three dimensionality of the images are just classic.Okay a few pet peeves.  This camera is heavy.  After a few days I developed the strength to heave it around.  The battery life is surprisingly good when you think it can take 300-500 photos off the equivalent power of one AA battery.  However the batteries are huge and the charger is an absolute tank.If your looking for a \"pro\" level camera and aren't interested in being caught up in \"megapixel madness\" then this is the camera for you.  The only camera that could replace this one would be a Canon pro level full frame, but right now they are WAAY too expensive.  Maybe in five years time I can get a full frame used for $300.  On the other hand, I just might shoot with this cam for the rest of my life :)", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "Douglas P. Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R327H2KES9BPL8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Disclaimer: I did not buy mine through Amazon.I was in high school when I first saw this camera, but I could not afford it back then. Fast forward to now and I was able to purchase one secondhand, with the charger and battery, for $230. I put on a 40mm lens and started taking pictures with it. Coming from a 20D (which I still use), the controls of this camera felt a bit 'awkward' but besides that I love the fast, accurate AF and the images it produces. I'll post some pictures when I get the chance to, but I swear the noise reminds me of film grain.Would I recommend this camera to anyone? Absolutely not! I'd only recommend it to individuals who are aware of its limitations and know how to take picture besides using the \"auto\" mode.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R1UN047RO75UUV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this used for $450 and am VERY impressed with it. It only has 4.2MP which is fine because if I ever need images above 2464 x 1648 I can just use interpolation. This is a very solid body, I love the 8fps, and for a 10 year old camera this still blows away the Canon rebel series. I also own a T2i which is great for the video, high iso, & high MP but the build quality of the 1D is far superior as well as the fps, & af points.I highly recommend this, or if you have some extra cash then get the mark ii", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "I don't like it", "Author": "khaitran", "ReviewID": "R3ONMCXHD296DS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought Canon EOS-1D 4.15MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) . but That's Item too old. so I hate it", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Old but Amazing", "Author": "Andre Hayward", "ReviewID": "R3UF52RIP744ZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK so its low in Piks,but for general and close up,I find this camera unbeatable,it also adds to my Canon collection,next will be the 1d-MK111 (Yes I am a BIG Canon fan)", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "terrible experience", "Author": "carbine_san", "ReviewID": "R2VLYBU12YY3N1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's disappointed to find an \"error 99\" when I try this equipment\uff0chow should I do\uff1fby the way,it's difficult to find the accessories", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera, but too low resolution.", "Author": "SeeAndSay", "ReviewID": "RNVSQCGEFDS0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good camera, but too low resolution.
