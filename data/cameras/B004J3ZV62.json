{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wonderful compact camera with hd video", "Author": "J. Gebauer", "ReviewID": "RQ9HPD3JV6JGJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a DSLR photographer who shoots professionally and has managed a camera store in the past. I wanted something I can take with me everywhere but still produces good quality shots. I also wanted a camera that could shoot good looking videos. I researched several models and after much deliberation decided on the Canon 300 HS. I'm very happy I did.Image Quality:I tested cameras and lenses all the time while managing the camera store so whenever I purchase a new camera or lens I always test it. The Canon 300 HS doesn't produce the quality of images my Nikon D7000 does but I didn't expect it to. The edges get a little soft with the 300 HS when looking at the image at 100% whereas the D7000 images are almost tact sharp.Comparing the 300 HS to the Canon Powershot SD1000 from a few years ago, the 300 HS blows it out of the water. The SD1000 is a 7 MP camera. Shooting the same shots on a tripod with the same focal length on the lens the 300 HS uses its extra MPs well. When looking at the images from each camera at 100%, at the wide angle zoom setting and normal zoom setting both cameras have about the same relative slight softness on the edges. However the 300 HS has more MP so it actually produces much more detail in the image. I think it was smart for Canon to keep the MP at 12 because last years models while being 14 MP (SD1400) didn't give any extra detail from what I could tell than the 12 MP version (SD1300). The SD1400 was basically just creating larger files. When zooming in the telephoto setting the 300 HS clearly produced a sharper image than the SD1000. Often cameras have sweet spots in the zoom range in which it will produce crisper images. The 300 HS has consistently good sharpness throughout it's zoom range.HS system and ISO:The image processing with the HS system truly works to reduce noise at higher ISOs enabling people to produce better quality images in low light. The improvement in image quality gets more and more visible the greater and greater the ISO. ISO 400 with the 300 HS was almost as good as ISO 200 on the SD1000. ISO 800 on the 300 HS was a tad better than ISO 400 on the SD1000. ISO 1600 on the 300 HS was between ISO 400 and 800 on the SD1000. ISO 3200 on the 300 HS produced the same quality of image (noise) as ISO 800 on the SD1000. A 2 stop in film speed improvement is big.1080p video and slow motion:With good light, the 300 HS produces wonderful smooth 1080 videos. If you look at a lot of HD videos from compact cameras the video often looks jumpy. From what I've seen it wasn't until you got to the Canon G12 or Panasonic LX5 that the video looked smooth. Both of those cameras only shoot 720p whereas this camera shoots 1080p. The video also very good detail. It truly looks HD.If you are wanting zoom and continuous AF with your video this camera is the one you want compared to the 100 HS which doesn't allow you to zoom. The continuous AF with face recognition is stellar with this camera in video mode. I was videoing my wife while she was driving. It focused on her face. I switched to the scenery outside. It immediately focused on that. I then went back to my wife and it found her face and focused on it right away. I even videoed her reflection in the rear view mirror and it found her face in the mirror no problem and focused on it. AMAZING!!!!Commenting on a complaint I've read about the zoom being slow in video mode. If you like getting motion sickness whenever someone rapidly zooms in or out during their video this is not your camera. As smooth looking as the video is, the zoom is also. The smooth zoom creates nice looking transitions instead of warp speed ahead looks.The slow motion is a fun feature that works well. You need to have good lighting though. In low light even with high ISO's it produced very dark videos. In a review someone commented that it should have sound with the slow motion video. I honestly don't know how that could work unless you want to listen to everything at 1/5 it's normal speed. I think it's a good thing that it doesn't have sound with the slow motion videos.AF:I commented on AF partially in the video portion of the review. It does have several AF modes for various situations. The face detection works great. If you have a person in the picture but want something other than the person to be in focus you will need to change AF modes from face detection. The reviewer that had the problem with the 300 HS focusing on things he didn't want the camera to focus on likely didn't have the correct AF mode for the shooting situations. The 300 HS does have a center AF if you prefer that.Areas for Canon to improve on with the 300 HS:The camera is so well thought out that I'm surprised Canon let this slip. I love having a wide angle zoom go down to 24mm. It's great for scenery and photojournalist type shots. If you shoot at the widest angle zoom and use the flash, the lens on the 300 HS blocks the flash's exposure on the bottom right corner of the image. The corner is completely black. If you zoom in a bit so you aren't at the widest angle setting when using the flash you will be fine. Still all Canon had to do is not put the flash so close to the lens.When shooting video in lower light situations the video does start to get noisy and grainy quicker than some other cameras.Conclusion:All in all this is a wonderfully thought out camera with great image quality and image processing and it shoots stellar videos for it's compact size.", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Point and Shoot", "Author": "Keith Corbin", "ReviewID": "R148IRCXCOAV53", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a point and shoot class camera, if you understand that going in, you are going to be more than impressed with it. I'm going from an SD630 and hands down, this beats it. I even had an SX210IS and these images are on par with it, if not better. I had to return my SX210IS as it had issues with dust on the image sensor and I've been waiting for a new P&S; class to come out. I bit the bullet on this, well, the black version Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS 12 MP CMOS Digital Camera with Full 1080p HD Video (Black) and what can I say - I am happy!300HS vs 500HS:There is a 500HS version of the camera, which is approx $50 more. To this point, the only differences I can tell are the LCD on the back as well as aperture priority and shutter priority, while the 300hs does not. The touch screen on the 500hs can also be used to focus on a particular subject. The 500hs also has a wider aperture at 2.0, the 300hs has 2.7.Form Factor/Display:Small. Awesome. There is a texture on the camera, I really like this as it seems like it will help if you hands are wet (sweat, snow, etc). Easy to operate one hand and if using both hands, flash isn't in a horrible place. Display is very bright and button seem intuitive as with other Canon cameras. Battery and SD are on the bottom door, USB and HDMI are in a covered side port. Comes with a wrist strap if you desire a little extra security.Boot Time/Software:Camera is ready to take photos very fast. From the time you press the button, it's pretty much set to catch the action. Time between photos wasn't terrible (about 1.5 seconds) and if you need it, there is continuous shot mode. Had no problem with the Canon software on Windows 7. I've used the Canon Photo Window import for a while, does a good job of getting photos off the camera without duplicates. I use Picasa to then manage my photo library (I skip the Zoom Browser, but it's really not bad if you want to use it, I'm just a slave to Google/gmail)Computer Connectivity:I didn't find this anywhere in the specs, so if you're looking, the camera uses mini-USB, similar to all Canon's that have come out over the last few years.Optical Zoom:You're going to be impressed with the form factor of this camera and it's 5x OPTICAL zoom. I immediately disabled digital zoom as 12.1MP + 5x Optical will get you very close to the action. You're better off digitally enhancing the photos later on.Battery + Memory Card:This uses the NBL-4 (again, I found confusion on this and accessories) - so if you have some of those laying around keep them as they'll work just fine in this camera. This is nice as my SD630 uses the NBL-4 so now I have 2 chargers + 3 batteries. It took my 32GB SDHC without any issues and holds thousands of images. Images have tended to be between 2 and 3mb on the highest settings.Image Quality:Look, I'm no photo fanatic, I don't expect the people buying this camera are. I am looking for solid images and this camera delivers. There are a ton a feature you can delve into and I'm sure they are good. It has manual mode, so if you fancy that, you can go down that path. But I'm the type of person that knows when something looks good, OK or great. This camera consistently delivers GREAT photos. I'm happy with the low light and images aren't blurry or grainy (within reasonable expectations).Video:FINALLY! Optical zoom on a Canon during video! 1080p brings this camera up to par with others in its class and it does a decent job. I didn't notice any major noise when zooming in and out while recording video. I know this is the excuse Canon has used in the past as to why they never had this feature. It shoots nice clips for those quick moments. This will NOT replace a true DV cam, but hey, for a few minute clips here and there, you will simply not be dissapointed.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Another great Canon product!", "Author": "sojo", "ReviewID": "R1PK4PVTQ5GKA1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I currently own a 5D Mark II and was looking to replace my Canon S80 which is now 6 yrs old. While I love the S80 and the quality pics it captured, the bulkiness of this point-and-shoot (P&S;) became inconvenient. My wife was adamant she wanted a more compact P&S; this time around.In addition to great pics, I was looking for a P&S; with 1080p video capability so I wouldn't have to get a separate camcorder. Let me say that the 300 HS is a quality camera packed into a sleek body that I can easily slip into any pocket on the run.Most Canon cameras (I am a Canon loyalist) take great shots. But what most impresses me about this camera are its low-light capabilities.  It obviously can not match the image quality of a DSLR, but for a P&S;, I was impressed!  Indoor night shots of my kids WITHOUT flash (incandescent lighting only) come out amazingly crisp with minimal noise. Autofocus is quite impressive as it tracks faces in the frame further enhancing ease of use. Menu functions are quite intuitive (if you've owned previous Canon models). It's got plenty of preset shooting modes. And it's quick between shots for a P&S; (a couple seconds with flash photography).I also compared the 1080p video vs Flip Ultra HD which shoots in 720p. The video quality is like night-and-day with the 300 HS finishing ahead by a mile. Low-light video is grainy but still watchable (unwatchable on Flip). In daylight, video looks beautiful. Video is easily imported into both iphoto and imovie.  Just make sure you have a large memory card as 1080p takes up 16GB/hour of video.  I bought a 32GB card.I did purchase an extra battery after reading battery life can be short. I've had the camera a week and have used it for 15-30 minutes daily (including video capture) and I have not needed to recharge yet.I'd also recommend the black body as it has a textured housing that makes holding this small camera much easier.Also purchased a Caselogic TBC - 302 compact camera case which fits this camera perfectly.  It has a small side pocket that I slip the extra battery in.Overall, considering the excellent quality of the camera, easy portability, and great price, this camera is worth every penny.", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera if it's what you're looking for", "Author": "Force2BRW", "ReviewID": "RS5GGALTNXXXY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had it for a couple days now, but I can honestly say this camera was worth every penny so far. It has a lot of interesting features, and is the only camera I have found that hits all the strong points I was looking for (120 fps @ 640x480 resolution, full 1080 hd video, optical zoom and auto focus during movie recording, strong low-light performance, good image stabilization, and small form factor [very small. much smaller than other cameras like it that I was considering])Other things of note: I have Photoshop, and use it regularly, so I wasn't looking for a camera that can do everything by itself. This camera cannot shoot hdr pictures by itself like the Exilim ZR-10 or 100 can, nor can it take panoramic pictures all by itself. It does have a \"panorama helper\" kind of application, which will help you line up the shots, but you must then use software later to merge them (it comes with software, compatible with both mac and pc, that will help you merge photos, as well as sort through them and manage them, but I find that Photoshop does a much better job than the packaged software does at creating panoramas. I also use the HDR toning option on Photoshop to simulate an actual HDR picture. As long as all the details are there (not blown out or too dark to brighten), PS can create a very convincing HDR picture, and this camera does a good job at getting all the detail in pictures.It also doesn't take the fastest pictures (around 3 per second) on continuous mode, but I rarely (if ever) take more than 1 picture at a time. I may take pictures in succession, but I generally set each one up, rather than just shotgunning a bunch of pictures.The pictures are very sharp. I haven't had much time with video or sound yet, but the little that I have played around with it produced pretty good results. (altho sound can get very distorted with windy sound in a windy environment, as many camera's microphones can. still thinking about/searching for a remedy...)Also, just a little side note, the finish on the camera is left a bit rough. This is a good thing, as it gives the camera more grip, and makes it less likely to slip out of your hand. I have used cameras that were shiny and slippery before, and it make taking pictures with one hand much more difficult and risky. The rough texture keep this camera more firm in your hand. This also makes the camera less prone to finger prints, altho the screen will collect plenty of those (but that has never really bothered me much)Just a couple knocks against it that I have found so far, but they are not deal breakers for me. It says that it can take pictures with shutter speeds between 1/2000s and 15s. This may be true, but it is not user choosable. You cannot set the shutter speed of the camera. It has options for \"Longer Exposure\" (or something named like that), but does not let you choose the speed. I have not gotten it to hit a 15 second exposure yet. I was thinking of trying a city scene on a tripod where you set the exposure long so that the car lights look like streaks, but it doesn't seem to stay open long enough.Also, the zoom doesn't seem to be variable, it goes at one speed, and it's pretty fast, so sometimes it can be hard to hit that sweet spot if you are trying to get a shot somewhere in the middle (5x zoom, which I think is very reasonable for it's size), and optical zoom is pretty slow while recording video, but still an option, which is more than many cameras of this type can say. The battery may also be a tad short (especially if doing a lot of video and/or zooming in and out, but that will shorten the life all camera batteries), but they are pretty small, and you can get extra, generic batteries for very cheap.There is no way to plug in the camera to a wall for continuous shooting/video, so you need to replace the battery when it dies. However, I have seen the option of having a battery stand-in that sits in the battery slot and runs a line down to an adapter that plugs into the wall, but this will require you to leave the battery door open while using it)For everything your getting, I think this camera is well worth $250. It takes sharp, accurately colored pictures look great on their own, as well as with Photoshop. If you do not own any imaging editing software, this camera still produces great pictures, has a ton of very cool, very interesting modes (some of which I've never seen on any camera before), and comes with some simple editing software (mainly for merging panorama shots. there is also other, free image editing software out there on the internet if you are so inclined)Edit:You CAN choose the shutter speed, it's just not as simple to find as some of the other options. You have to go into program mode, choose the Long Shutter option. Exit program mode. When you're back to the normal screen, press the up button (+/-). From there, you can choose the shutter speed by pressing right and left. Glad to find the option!", "Date": "March 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best quality you can get for under $200", "Author": "fisharefriends", "ReviewID": "R1RH342FSM4JAA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall, this is the best under $200 camera you will find. My simple advice is: there is power in reviews. I looked at a dozen professional reviews for this camera and after 3 weeks of owning this camera, I am completely satisfied with my purchase. I will just list a few quick points about this camera rather than pro's and cons because there are a ton of other reviews doing that. If you don't have the time (or commitment) to read through this entire review, the first sentence of each bullet will summarize the point. Also do remember that out of cameras within 5 years old, this is the only one I've owned so I suppose you can take the review with a grain of salt. When it comes to me comparing it to other cameras out there, I am simply re-hashing what I read on other professional reviews. Think of it as me doing your shopping research for you. Bottom line, I highly recommend this camera.-I am not a professional, I am not an amateur, I am a casual user. I don't take photos for fun, I take them for the memories. I believe if you don't have the camera with you, it is worthless. But..if they are low-quality pictures, you will regret it in the future when you look back.-I bought this for $150, and you will not find another camera for a better value in my opinion! The other camera I was looking at was the Sony WX-9, but my bias towards Canon won out and I'm glad it did.-If you are shopping for a camera, shop by price. I know it shouldn't boil down to money, but the truth is it is all about money when it comes to electronic purchases. If you are willing to spend more, you will always find a better camera. Pick your budget and stick to it. In the under $100 range, I have no suggestions because I did not want to spend that little on a camera that I expect to last at least 5 years. If you are in the $200-300 range, I would suggest ignoring the basic point-and-shoot altogether. Get a Canon S95 (the newer version is the S100, but it is $120 more), it is a borderline DSLR while still being a compact. It has manual controls, control rings to adjust focus and aperture and ISO settings, and altogether is in a whole different class of cameras. Do note though that the S95 only has 720p video (although the new S100 has full 1080p video). I would not suggest the elph 500/510, because those are up near $300 and there is no reason to get a basic point-and-shoot that costs as much as cameras with decent manual controls and settings, not to mention much higher photo quality. Unless you must have a touch screen.. The pro's are a better user interface, a larger screen in general (because you don't have to place buttons on the layout), and the ability to select your focus point with a simple touch. The downsides are not being able to use it with gloves on, and a significantly lower battery life (the reason I didn't want one.)-The black camera has a sandpaper-like finish, while the silver and red versions have the traditional, somewhat slick finish. The black camera has the sandpaper finish that owners have either praised because it give more grip, or loathed because it felt cheap or picked up lint and dust too easily. I actually originally bought the black version because it was cheaper (also $150 at the time..but the silver was $180) and I knew about the texture going into it. When I got it, I thought I liked the sandpaper texture because it provided more grip, but after owning it for about a week, I didn't like it anymore because of said reasons. I bought the silver version for my brother because he was also in need of a camera, and lo and behold, it was a sleek, traditional finish. I liked it enough to return the black one i bought and get a silver one for myself.-There are indeed versions of this camera that are made in china, and others made in Japan. My thoughts (albeit just speculation) is that all these cameras were originally made in Japan, but considering the tsunami and the fact that there is a newer version (elph 310) out, production was shifted to China. There are others saying that only the Made in Japan versions are worth it because of the zoom 'knock' around 3.8x zoom in the China versions, but I will say that both of the cameras that my brother and I own do not have this problem. They both will have a motor zoom noise, but whether it has the knock or not I suppose it's just the specific camera you receive. Yes, traditionally Japan will have higher quality products than China, but in this case I did not notice a difference. I actually read another review (this one a professional one) that said the China versions had a quieter motor zoom noise, but that just depends on the specific one you receive. I actually was planning on returning mine to look for a Made in Japan one, but after playing around with it for a few weeks, I decided not to. Since the 'knock' isn't present, I figured they aren't going to get any quieter than what I have. If you are paranoid about it (as I was for a little while), good luck on your search.-turn off the \"AF-assist beam\" setting for taking macros. In general, Infrared rangefinders are very inaccurate in short distances (under 6 inches), it will make it impossible to focus on close shots. The only time you need this setting on is when it is very dark (almost no light), but you want to take a shot with no flash. Then it will be able to properly find a focal length. But if there is light present, this camera will auto-focus without it. Also, when using flash, there is another setting in the camera that will allow you to use this infrared rangefinder only when you use flash.-there is a newer version of this camera, the Elph 310. The basic differences are: 310 has a 3\" screen vs 2.7\" and a higher resolution at 461k vs. 230k pixels, 310 has a macro rating down to 1cm vs. 3 cm, 310 has 8x zoom vs. 5x, but it has a worse sensor in it (maximum f3.0 aperture vs. f2.7..the smaller number actually means a better aperture on cameras). I don't know why a newer version would have a downgrade on it..but it does in this sense. This mostly only affect low-light shots without flash, but that is something that deterred me from upgrading. Professional reviews that I read said the overall picture quality of the 310 was slightly worse than the 300. The 310 also costs $200 while the 300 is $150 (assuming you find decent, albeit somewhat common sales on them).-The startup time is very quick (under 1 sec) and delay between pictures is also quick, assuming you turn review off. There is also almost negligent shutter delay. It focuses in under a second. Overall, a very fast camera. There are also high-speed burst modes (~8shots/sec, but at a lower, 3MP quality) and continuous shot mode (~3shots/sec, but full quality). Do note that the speeds of these shots is dependent on the memory card speed (see below). Also, their focus is dependent on the first shot's focus, so you won't be able to change subjects in the burst (same as any camera)-This camera has one of the best auto modes out there. If you are buying a point-and-shoot, I'm assuming you are not an avid photographer that is going to go through menus and settings to find a good photo, you just want to have the camera do it for you. I am a fan of not having to use flash if possible, so this camera was perfect for me. It has the best low-light pictures out of others in its price range. But in reality, the only difference between a camera with good picture quality and a camera with bad picture quality is its ability to take low-light pictures. Cameras from 8 years ago already had fantastic pictures in good lighting, but they were grainy and soft in low lighting. This camera is fantastic in low lighting settings. Reviews I read said it will be completely crisp up to about an ISO of 800, but even at 1600 I found it to be ok. High ISO settings require a longer exposure, so if you are very steady of hand or have a tripod, that will vary your 1600 and higher ISO photos (for the better or worse). But if you are taking pictures in that low of light, you'd probably be better off using flash.-Like other reviews have said, I am quite surprised that Canon did not prevent this, but there is a shadow in the bottom right-hand corner of pictures when you use flash, due to the flash area not being wide enough and it being too close to the lens. However..what isn't stated in most reviews is that the problem is dependent on the distance of the photos. At macro range (within 6 inches), the shadow covers almost an 1/8\" of the corner, which is unacceptable as a photo, but that shadow gets much smaller as you get further away from your subject (somewhat common sense, but I might as well say it). at around a foot, the shadow is nearly gone, but still faint and present. Anything past 1 foot away there is no shadow. To be honest, 95% of your pictures that require flash are going to be taken from further than a foot away. I don't know anyone that takes macro shots in very low lighting that requires flash..they're all taken in good lighting. So..it is a big problem that you will most likely never encounter (making it a small problem?).-The image stabilization is very good in my mind. It isn't going to completely eliminate large vibrations from a very unsteady hand, but any regular shakes in you or the subject will not appear in the photo. Unlike almost all cameras in the under $200 range, this camera has true lens optical stabilization rather than a digital stabilization.-the video does cut off at 10min (or when you run out of memory), but you can always start taking videos again once it cuts off. I will admit, that can get annoying, but I suppose you don't really take long videos on a P&S;, get a camcorder for that. I know other P&S; cameras have limits up to 30min (the Sony Cybershots in particular), but that was just a minor irk for me.-Put a class 10 memory card in there. For 1080p video, anything less than class 6 will have your video cutting short because it cannot keep up with the filesize. But class 10 cards truly maximize the speed of the camera, going from being dependent on the card to the maximum limit of the camera's processor. This is useful in terms of the delay between shots, the speed of rapid shot bursts, and the speed of continuous shots. I would recommend Sandisk Extreme disks. I bought my 16gb class 10 for $24, but that was a black friday sale. Normal prices are 8gb for ~$20, 16gb for ~$35, and 4gb for ~$12. Class ratings for memory cards denote their minimum speeds: class 4 at 4mb/s, class 6 at 6mb/s, and class 10 at 10mb/s. However, the average speed for cards is not noted in class ratings. The sandisk cards have ratings of 'up to 30mb/s', and reviews I read on the cards have sandisk cards being almost twice as fast as other class 10 cards. 4gb translates to 15 min of 1080p video, 8gb as 30min, and 16gb as 60 min of 1080p. You will get well over 1000 pictures (the highest quality..largest size) with a 4gb card, so if you don't plan on taking any video, 4gb should be sufficient.-this camera has plenty of toys to it, but my favorites are the long exposures (up to 15s) and the slow-motion (high fps) movie modes. I live in Salt Lake City where the Christmas lights are absolutely beautiful, and to have a little fun, long exposures let you create effects with lights. You can write words with a flashlight, etc etc. This is also the same setting you use to get that motion-blur effect. Just make sure you are very steady of hand or have a tripod when using it, or your final subject will be blurry too. The slow motion video can be taken at 320*230@240 fps, or 640*480@120 fps. I prefer the slightly higher quality, but both these are somewhat low qualities. It's good for a laugh and entertainment though. There is no sound with the slow-motion movies though.I also wrote this as a reply to Stephan Krasner's review, but i figured it had good info in it so i will put it in a product review: ([...])I also purchased the elph 300 semi-recently, and I did not have the same problems you had with indoor and outdoor shots, sorry to hear that. You have to remember by default, this camera in auto mode will pick up an aperture/exposure from the entire shot's lighting (with the ability to change that in manual mode..but to be honest that isn't what people buy this camera for). This camera by far had the best auto-scene selection out of under $200 cameras out there in my opinion.As far as the screen goes, you might want to give the elph 310 (the new version of this camera) a shot if that is bugging you, it has nearly twice the resolution and a 3\" screen vs. this camera's 2.7\" screen. It is ~$200 rather than $150 though, assuming you do a little shopping to find a decent price (these were the most common prices I saw leading up to and during Thanksgiving). That was also one key concern when I bought this camera, but after playing with it in-stores, I found it to be decent enough for my liking. Do remember that there is an option in the menu called \"AF-Point Zoom\" that magnifies the focus subjects on the screen, both while taking and reviewing photos (they're 2 separate settings). It's enough for me to tell if I got a good picture or not. But yes..it would be nice to have a Sony-quality screen on there. Just not essential.Concerning macro, I did notice that when you have the auto-focus assist beam (from the menu) on, macro shots have a very hard time focusing. Simple solution, turn this setting off. The only time the camera really benefits from having this setting on is in really really (near black) low light. With any reasonable light present, even semi-low lighting, the camera does a fantastic job range-finding a focal point in my opinion. This camera is rated at a 3cm macro distance (that is from the tip of the lens at 1x zoom, remember..), but I found it able to focus well down to almost 2cm. I really believe that auto-focus infrared lamp was what was making your images so blurry. The simple truth is infrared rangefinders cannot correctly read distances at that close of a distance, but they work really well at mid-to long distances (anywhere past 6in). That is the truth about infrared rangefinding, in this camera and any application. I got beautiful shots from macro, and i suggested the Elph 310 to you earlier, that camera is rated down to 1cm macro. Since you said you were a huge fan of macro shots, that seems like a high recommendation to you. I can post or send some macro shots I took, they look fantastic to my eyes. The thing I love about this camera is the quick-key tracking auto-focus by simply pressing the up button. As long as you have a steady hand and basic knowledge of maintaining distance to keep the focal length, the center-focus allows me to focus on the subject I want and then offset and reposition the shot I want after focusing. Works wonderfully.I am glad you have found a P&S; you are satisfied with, but personally i find a difference of opinion when it comes to picture quality. I will admit, Sony Cybershots on average have much more bells and whistles, most notably their screen quality (most of them i shopped around for had 921k screens, vs. the 230k on this camera, or the 461k on the elph 310), but when it comes to picture quality (and with the elph 300/310's case, video), the Canon P&S; camera's blow them out of the water. Canon puts the goodies where it counts, in the actual sensor and camera rather than its toys and trinkets. It's nice to have a nice screen, but this one was decent enough for me (esp with the af-point zoom setting on) considering pictures are taken to be shared on a large screen or printed rather than on the camera.I am by no means a professional photographer, but I don't think this phone was marketed to professionals. I wouldn't even call myself an amateur, simply a casual user that takes photos for memories, not hobby. If you want a compact but slightly more 'advanced' manual control camera, I would suggest the s95 ($300) or s100 (the newer version, albeit $120 more), but this completely satisfies me. It looks like Canon's marketing scheme is working..after buying this camera, which in my opinion is way above its pricerange and is the best value you can find on the market today, I am really enjoying photography and just might take it up as a hobby. One of these days I might fork over the big bucks for a borderline DSLR camera, but my philosophy still stands that if you don't have the camera with you, it is worth nothing. But you do have to remember that value is the entire judge of a products quality..if you are willing to fork over more money, there are always more competitors that are higher quality.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Video shaking zooming in at around 3.8x and 4.8x", "Author": "T.

Sandisk Extreme Pro 32gb memory card and started to play with the video functions of the camera. I found that when I was zooming in from 1x, the video was very smooth until it hited around 3.8x, it was shaking twice, and when I continued to zoom in to around 4.8x, it shaking once a little more, no matter what resolutions I used (1280, 1920, 640). Please take a look at the video. I zoomed in all the way from 1x to 5x, and zoomed out and in several times between 3x and 5x. Zooming out was no shaking at all, but zooming in was shaking at around 3.8x and 4.8x. Does anybody have this kind of problem? I don't know if I got a defective one or it is normal. Please let me know and appreciate any comment. Thanks!![Update (4/23/2011)]: Finally I returned it because I thought it is defective and just received the replacement one this afternoon. The only difference I noticed at first is the returned one is \"Made in Japan\", and the new one is \"Made in China\". I tried to record video by zooming-in with the new camera and very happy to find out the video got perfect zooming-in without any shaking. But later I played that video file on my computer, and heard some very loud knocking sounds when the zooming-in almost reaching to the end (5x). I tried several times and the results were the same. I listened very carefully when I recorded video by zooming-in the camera, and found out the knocking sounds came from the lens' motor. That didn't happan with the returned camera!! I think Canon must have some quality assurance problems. I bought this camera to replace my two and half years old Creative Labs Vado HD 720p Pocket Video Camcorder that only has poor digital zoom function, so I wanted to use this camera to record video mostly and expected much from its 5x optical zoom. I don't know if I would return this replacement one too. :([Update (4/25/2011)]: Found another person has the similar problem - clicking noise when zooming-in during video mode. Because Amazon doesn't allow to post the link directly. Please go to YouTube and put \"Unboxing Canon Elph 300 HS\" in the Search field. Go to the movie page posted by \"whynot7891\", and see the comments just below that movie.[Updated (5/2/2011)]: Finally I returned my replacement camera. Before I did that, I went to the local BestBuy, and bought another one that is made in Japan. I was happy to find out that one is free of problems. Though I still can hear the lens noise when zooming, but it is hardly audible. I am glad I didn't give up, because I really love this camera. It is very compact, fast to function, and creates great picture and video even in low light. I particularly love its 24mm wide and 5x lens. I would like to give it a 4 and a half stars if I can. Good luck to get your one![Updated (10/4/2011)]: For your information, there is a new model coming out - Canon PowerShot ELPH 310 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with Full 1080p HD Video (Silver). Price is $60 more as today, with same 12.1 MP, same DIGIC 4 processor, but higher 8x Optical Zoom (a plus), larger 3\" LCD display (another plus), narrower 28mm lens (a minus), and with more body color options (no black though).", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great \"Burst Mode\" for Action Shots", "Author": "rc \"Adopt a shelter pet PetFinder.\"", "ReviewID": "R3CBELPNE50TCU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had this camera for a month or two now from a previous purchase. But saw the great price just now and decided to get another. This camera meets all of the needs I have in taking photos of dogs at the local animal shelter to help get them adopted. What I needed was something great in low lighting without flash due to the shiny reflection off of dogs' eyes with flash, as well as a super fast burst mode to try to capture that just right pose when the dog smiles, but without having to guess when the dog will smile.  So I just start pressing and it takes like 8-10 shots in a second or so.  Fantastic!  And the HD video of course is great, which I use to make videos of the dogs playing with toys or with other dogs to show off they energy levels or socialability with other dogs of various personalities.Don't shop, adopt a shelter pet! :O)", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "great camera, with a few caveats", "Author": "davbol", "ReviewID": "R2I3GHJ8BPWZCH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Quickly:  very pleased with this camera, good for indoor kid shots and such.Longer (much!) version for those interested...Background  We've been looking for a replacement for our dear SD870IS which died of the dreaded lens error.  We've been using a SD4000IS in the interim, which is acceptable, but hasn't quite lived up to the 870's shooting performance or image quality.  We've been through (and returned) countless P&S;'s from various mfr's, and this 300HS is the closest we've come to an adequate replacement.(Aside:  I found it interesting that I'm not the only SD870IS user that has ended up here, see other reviews -- pretty sure we're all seeking something similar.  I'd have bought another 870, but they're now going for 2X original price, yikes, and I know from trying some refurbs hands-on that it's a big gamble on whether it ever fully recovers from the surgery)The particular niche that we're in, and is one that I think this camera suits, is indoor shooting, kids and such, without flash.  For us, a camera either does a good job in that situation or it's a failure.  This is a job best left for our DSLR, of course, but when away from home (birthday parties, etc) we want a P&S; that can at least come close.  I'd say my expectations are high, but not unreasonable - the SD870IS met our needs.So this review is targeted in that direction.  Outdoor shots in full sun aren't nearly as challenging, and this camera does a fine job at those, so it's not worth much comment from me.  Instead I'll focus solely on the \"is it good for indoors\" aspects.Short answer:  Yes!  (but, see \"But...\" below)The sensor is quite sensitive.  The lens is (can be) quite fast.  The autofocus is (can be) quite responsive.We're about 1000 shots into this camera.  Maybe 100 of those are \"careful\" shots, and another 900 or so that were taken haphazardly just playing with the camera in various ways.  The vast majority of careful shots were \"keepers\", and quite a number of the haphazard shots turned out as well.  (By \"careful\" I mean that, at the very least, time was taken to frame and half-press prefocus in anticipation of the right moment;  by \"haphazard\" I mean just point and full-press, cross fingers, and hope something interesting happens when the shutter opens)Images are of low noise, not overly softened, and (for the most part) have proper tone/balance/color/etc, JPG artifacts seem minimal (using best setting), etc - overall quite pleased with image quality.BTW, I'm not a megapixel junky, 12 is plenty, don't fall for the hype.  Canon is (partially) headed in the right direction by (partially) reversing this trend.  I say (partially) because they have other models that are still chasing that megapixel marketing monster with 1/2.3\" CCD sensors, which seems ridiculous to me.  The A3300IS, for example, would not at all be appropriate _for me_.Heck, I'd be fine if this had been a 10Mpx sensor in the hopes of getting yet one more stop of sensitivity.  That's a tradeoff I'd gladly make.  (SD870IS is only 8, SD4000IS is only 10, both are adequate for our use)  I say this only so you get a sense of where I'm coming from, what's important to me in this review - maybe it is/isn't important to you.  That tiny sensor DOES appear to have enough sensitivity to support (most of) Canon's HS hype at 12Mpx.The 24-105mm f2.7-5.9 is very nearly same as 870's 28-205 f2.8-5.8 on paper.  Just a tiny smidge wider and faster at full wide.  Though my sense is that the 870 might have had a bit better glass overall.But... to get the most out of the low light sensitivity of this camera you'll have to live within it's sweet spot.  It's not AS fast, with just ANY settings.Some caveats:  The lens is only fast at it's widest setting, and gets noticeably slower quite rapidly with any amount of zoom.  That's fine for our use, as we zoom with our feet, and in fact I just treat it as a 28mm prime lens.  (if you're outdoors in sun, f5.9 at full tele is plenty fast, so full range of lens is usable)  Problem with wide angle is (as mentioned by others) the flash is too close to lens and bottom-right will be shadowed.  Again, that's fine for our use, as I despise flash, and force it off.  I'd rather have an underexposed picture in natural light than a properly exposed picture using any P&S-caliber; flash, so I'm willing to ignore this flaw.  Auto mode isn't always that smart, and it does seem to slow down shooting performance noticeably.  Some of this is apparently the continuous AF, which, while would be a handy feature, seems to be a performance penalty rather than benefit, and is only available in Auto mode.  The remainder is probably the \"scene detector\", you can often witness it \"change its mind\" as to what it thinks you're shooting if there activity in the scene.  Program mode, even with everything left at defaults, is far better, and is definately my favored mode of operation.  Auto white balance can be fooled, though it's more often ok than not.  A small gripe, and is the case with most P&S;'s, so I'm not overly faulting this camera.  Again, though, if you're inside and can set it to tungsten (or as appropriate, or manual) specifically, you'll get better consistency.  (and tho I can't confirm it rigorously, i have the feeling that this too, like auto-scene detect, makes the camera ever-so-slightly less responsive in full auto mode - so set it yourself and solve two problems at once)  BTW, if you can accept the reduced resolution, the 3Mpx modes (high speed burst & low light) offer opportunities to capture some photos that I'd never expect a camera of this size to get.  I've tried similar modes on current Nikon/Sony/etc, though none were as effective imo.  For the most part, I don't intend this review to cover the other \"effect\" modes, as I myself will never use them, but these two modes seemed worth mentioning.Other issues:  I do miss the 3\" screen of the 870IS.  I sort of wish there were a \"400HS\" model that used the (nice) screen from the Sx230HS.  (am personally NOT a fan of 500HS's touchscreen)  Of course it'd have to be a bit bigger, but that's ok, it's so tiny right now there's some room to grow and still be pocketable, and they could probably then fix the flash location too.  My dream imaginary \"400HS\" would also have the remaining PSAM modes (shutter/aperature/manual missing here) of the Sx230HS.  I'd particularly like to have a shutter priority mode (or at least a \"sports\" type scene mode that strongly favors fast shutter in its overall solution).  But I don't need the 230's GPS, don't like it's flash, don't need all that zoom, don't like the lens speed tradeoff you make for that zoom, autofocus seems a bit laggier with that lens, etc -- in short, the Sx230HS wasn't a good fit for me overall, so that extra bit of control was something I had to gave up to get a better overall fit with the 300.A note on the texture of the black model:  It's subtle, and I personally like it, makes it feel like a camera.  No, it's not sleek like your cell phone, but you can get the red or silver model if you'd rather have a camera that's more likely to slip out of your hands.Summary:  If you're doing well-lit shots, then no problem recommending this camera, it's as good if not better than others in this price range.  If you're doing poorly lit shots, particularly if you don't need zoom, then I'd highly recommend this camera, as it's currently better than any other that I'm aware of in this price range.  Same for all the current \"HS\" line (Elph 100/300/500 HS, Sx20HS), I've tried all of them, though this is the one that best suited me, so I know it best -- check out the other model specs and see which best suits you.  I'd give this camera 4.5 stars if I could - as I more than \"like it\", but fall short of \"loving it\".  It's really just about as good as it can be for what it is and what it costs, but Amazon calls their stars \"like/love\", so 4 is more appropriate.  I'd have to reserve 5 stars for the ficticious \"400HS\" as described above - come on Canon, build it!! :D", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beware of the lens", "Author": "Samsen", "ReviewID": "R3BSWG4ZRJGE5R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am a total believer in Canon over many years and though not buying this camera from amazon, I thought of adding this review as many look for the reviews on amazon no mater where they buy the product.

In my research I see this as a common problem of this model and if you run a search for eg on ebay, you see many are sold for part for the same reason. I am not sure if this is the result of camera's sensitivity to fall or minor hit on the lens side or a defect of model but this is not something expected from a Canon Built. I wish Canon could address the issue and finds a remedy for the users specially those left without warranty and in any case you need to be very careful with handling of this camera or better, look for some other model.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Pocket Camera", "Author": "Jiunjr Feng \"Robert\"", "ReviewID": "R3GGJTYALWDVQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this camera from my Japanese friend as a birthday gift, which is IXY 410F.  I found out that camera name in USA is ELPH 300 HS.  After open the box and play couple days, the weight is super light as my old school Canon SD1000 and the indoor picture quality is not bad comparing with my current S95, so it catched my eyes right away after we received it.  Even it's SD1400 replacement from canon point of view, I have to say this tiny camera with S95 quality.ELPH 300 HS vs S95ELPH 300 HS wins on 1080P movie, weight (70% of S95), CMOS sensor, 24mm, 5x zoom, shooting speed (2 time faster than S95), cost (62.5% of S95)S95 is better on the sensor size (1/1.7\" as G12), Aperture F/2.0, RAW.I would say...For sure S95 won on manual setting, but I used my Canon Rebel XS most of the time when looking for quality pictures, and S95 didn't provide more point-and-shoot advantages than ELPH 300 HS to me. CMOS sensor is more sensertive comparing with CCD, so I cannot tell huge difference between bigger size CCD and smaller size CMOS sensors even from those indoor low light pictures.  End out, I traded the manual settings to small size, light weight, and fast shooting speed.So, my S95 moved on eBay...... and IXY 410F (ELPH 300 HS) is in my wife's bag......

Keep in mind that this review is only to help those of you out there who have already decided that the functionality of this camera satisfies you, but you are struggling with which color to get, as I was.Long story short, I've had both a black one and a silver one in my hand over the course of the last week (black returned due to a manufacturing problem that Amazon, as always, handled in an A+ manner - I chose to replace with the silver).  Now I'm the type of guy that always gets everything in black - clothes, furniture, and especially gadgets, so naturally I gravitated toward the black model.  That being said, get the silver one - period.  The black one does look cool, but the sandpaper texture, while providing good grip, absolutely detracts from the overall value of this camera. It makes it a pain to pull out of your pocket, picks up dirt and lint like a magnet, and just has an overall cheap feel to it.  I couldn't even wipe the screen off with a microfiber cloth without it catching and nearly tearing on the housing.  When I received the silver one, the first thing I thought when I opened it was, \"You've got to be kidding me. How can a color change alone constitute such a vast difference in satisfaction?\"  The answer is because I now feel like I have a quality camera I can actually use instead of something I have to constantly worry about catching on things and wiping lint off of.  Everything about the silver one blows the black out of the water; smooth finish feels very nice, looks nice, doesn't act like a lint brush, and the entire camera has a much sturdier, more solid feel to it in general.  In fact, one of the first huge things I noticed was the quality of the battery door.  I've owned many Canon P&S; cameras over the years, and when I first saw the door to the black camera, it immediately struck me as something way more low budget than I'm accustomed to seeing with Canon cameras.  When I received the silver one, instantly noticed the quality was back up to par.One final consideration that always manifests apprehension in the back of my mind when considering black cameras is that black, as everyone knows, absorbs sunlight, while lighter colors reflect it.  if you're going to use it mainly indoors or at night then no problem, but if you plan on using it the sun a lot like at the beach, on vacations, heavy daylight use in general, then it only makes sense to me that black cameras in these cases would be more prone to overheating and/or accelerated mechanical wear and tear.  If it's really enough to make a significant difference in the life cycle of the product is questionable, but that's just one of those things that, unlike with phones, handheld video game systems, etc, keeps me from automatically defaulting to the black model.In summary, great camera no matter what color you get, but for the price I just feel like the silver one gives me so much more value.  I can't speak of the red one as I've not seen it, but I've heard the texture is the same as the silver, and with regards to the advantages over the black one, most of the above would still apply.  Red is more of a girly color than silver though, so please keep that in mind if you're a guy.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love(d) Canon, but this has broken on me twice in 6 mo!!", "Author": "jessicaj", "ReviewID": "R2WI8J733HI9W2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am a long time Canon owner. Have owned multiple PowerShot cameras now (this is my 3rd) and also two Canon SLRs. So, obviously I like Canon products.This camera, however, has given me so many problems that I feel compelled to share. I've also been so frustrated with Canon and the warranty process that I wonder if I should stick with Canon in the future.I bought this camera in April of this year. In May, the lens got stuck in the extended position. I called Canon, sent the camera in, and a few weeks later they sent a new (refurbished) one. Now, the camera has broken again - exact same issue, lens stuck in the out position. They say this is rare - but given that it's happened twice, on two different cameras, I doubt that. I'm leaving for a 3 week international trip and customer service basically said that there's nothing they can do. I can send it in, wait a few weeks, and *maybe* get it fixed (only limited cases are covered under warranty apparently). If I want to take photos on my trip, I'll just have to just buy a new camera. They were also rude and insulting, suggesting it was my fault. It was definitely one of the worst customer services experiences I've had to date.Canon does make good camera products, but given the awful warranty/customer service support, I'd definitely think

Since she lives in the same household, I've had a chance to play with it too and thought I would do a video review here so you can have some idea of how the pictures and video look and some of the nice features. Although my sister has a Flip video camera, she really likes being able to take still photo and movies with the same camera.  We were amazed at how good the videos look.  The other great thing about this camera is how well it takes photos without a flash in low light setting.  Several of the photos included in the video are in low light so you can see what I mean.  The video of the storefronts actually looked darker in person as the sun was going down, but in the video it looks fairly bright.  It's difficult to see how nice the resolution is on a video since I had to save it as a small file that would fit on the review site, but it will give you some idea. Isn't that zoom amazing for such a small camera?If you have an optional HTC-100 HDMI cable you can view your videos directly on your HDTV.  This is a great feature at parties or family gatherings where everyone can see themselves on TV right after the pictures are taken.The image stabilization works well on the video, but when you zoom way in on an object, you do notice the shakiness as you'll see in my videos.  I think most cameras amplify any movements when you try to zoom. (I should have used a tripod). Anyway, I hope you enjoy the video and I hope it helps you to make a decision about the camera.

I'm going from an SD630 and hands down, this beats it. I even had an SX210IS and these images are on par with it, if not better. I had to return my SX210IS as it had issues with dust on the image sensor and I've been waiting for a new P&S; class to come out. I bit the bullet on this, well, the black version Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS 12 MP CMOS Digital Camera with Full 1080p HD Video (Black) and what can I say - I am happy!300HS vs 500HS:There is a 500HS version of the camera, which is approx $50 more. To this point, the only differences I can tell are the LCD on the back as well as aperture priority and shutter priority, while the 300hs does not. The touch screen on the 500hs can also be used to focus on a particular subject. The 500hs also has a wider aperture at 2.0, the 300hs has 2.7.Form Factor/Display:Small. Awesome. There is a texture on the camera, I really like this as it seems like it will help if you hands are wet (sweat, snow, etc). Easy to operate one hand and if using both hands, flash isn't in a horrible place. Display is very bright and button seem intuitive as with other Canon cameras. Battery and SD are on the bottom door, USB and HDMI are in a covered side port. Comes with a wrist strap if you desire a little extra security.Boot Time/Software:Camera is ready to take photos very fast. From the time you press the button, it's pretty much set to catch the action. Time between photos wasn't terrible (about 1.5 seconds) and if you need it, there is continuous shot mode. Had no problem with the Canon software on Windows 7. I've used the Canon Photo Window import for a while, does a good job of getting photos off the camera without duplicates. I use Picasa to then manage my photo library (I skip the Zoom Browser, but it's really not bad if you want to use it, I'm just a slave to Google/gmail)Computer Connectivity:I didn't find this anywhere in the specs, so if you're looking, the camera uses mini-USB, similar to all Canon's that have come out over the last few years.Optical Zoom:You're going to be impressed with the form factor of this camera and it's 5x OPTICAL zoom. I immediately disabled digital zoom as 12.1MP + 5x Optical will get you very close to the action. You're better off digitally enhancing the photos later on.Battery + Memory Card:This uses the NBL-4 (again, I found confusion on this and accessories) - so if you have some of those laying around keep them as they'll work just fine in this camera. This is nice as my SD630 uses the NBL-4 so now I have 2 chargers + 3 batteries. It took my 32GB SDHC without any issues and holds thousands of images. Images have tended to be between 2 and 3mb on the highest settings.Image Quality:Look, I'm no photo fanatic, I don't expect the people buying this camera are. I am looking for solid images and this camera delivers. There are a ton a feature you can delve into and I'm sure they are good. It has manual mode, so if you fancy that, you can go down that path. But I'm the type of person that knows when something looks good, OK or great. This camera consistently delivers GREAT photos. I'm happy with the low light and images aren't blurry or grainy (within reasonable expectations).Video:FINALLY! Optical zoom on a Canon during video! 1080p brings this camera up to par with others in its class and it does a decent job. I didn't notice any major noise when zooming in and out while recording video. I know this is the excuse Canon has used in the past as to why they never had this feature. It shoots nice clips for those quick moments. This will NOT replace a true DV cam, but hey, for a few minute clips here and there, you will simply not be dissapointed.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "shutter lens broke", "Author": "pawspa", "ReviewID": "R348YG2JDHCTU7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "the shutter lens would not open/close after a week, I had to send it back.

I settled on the Elph 300HS because I wanted a reliable and solid point and shoot camera, where the Auto feature would do all the work.  I admit I'm no photography pro, and I certainly don't have the time, patience, or inclination to fiddle with all the interminable and esoteric photographic settings, nor did I want a bulky camera to lug around.The video looks very good, especially on a hi-def monitor but tends to blur very slightly when zooming in too fast.  And I have to admit that having a zoom feature on hi-def video was a strong selling point for me.  The tiny stereo microphone works fine, and like all other similar cameras, picks up the ubiquitous wind sounds.  You should also be aware that these hi-def videos take up a lot more file space on your SD cards than \"mere\" DVD quality.I compared one or two pics on the Elph to the same shots taken at the same time on my older Canon Powershot A710IS (12 vs. 7 megapixels) and there was a slight discernable increase in the quality of the still shots.  I had hoped that the Elph photos would be much sharper and clearer because of the newer technology and the additional 5 megapixels, but the increase in quality, while noticeable, was minimal.  In all fairness, however, I did not print the photos, I only viewed them on my hi-def monitor.  With the price of ink cartridges these days, I'm very selective about printing color photos on my printer, but I am certain that the Elph photos, if printed, would look much better than those of my older camera.As claimed, the Elph does indeed take great shots in lower light, but the tradeoff for this is that the resulting photos seem to be a little softer than the shots taken in normal light.Another slight disappointment, as pointed out in another review, is that the videos are saved as .mov files rather than .avi or .wmv files.  Windows Movie Player will play them, but only by expanding the file types to \"any file\".  Fortunately, there are several programs out there which will convert these .mov files.  The one I use, Prism Video File Converter, can convert these .mov files to .wmv files (among others), and the .mov file sizes are reduced by an astonishing factor of one fifth, without a noticeable decrease in quality.  If you plan to edit or combine your Elph videos by using Windows Movie Maker, it will happily handle .wmv files, but not .mov files.The really surprising thing about the Elph is its very tiny size, a worthy example of the art and science of miniaturization.  Yet, it still feels quite heavy in the hand, no doubt due to all the electronic components packed into its tiny but solid metal frame which provide all its many features.  Bottom line?  It ain't perfect, but it's one hell of a sweet point and shoot camera.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a bad little camera but some things need improving", "Author": "Matt \"scupking\"", "ReviewID": "R391BOLU29XYXH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace my old A590IS. I also have a good canon HD video camera and a Nikon D40 dslr. I'm going to Florida in a week and wanted a great point and shoot that could do it all. I was going to only use the 300 HS and keep my video camera and DSLR at home. I did a lot of research and bought the ELPH 300 HS. I'm impressed with the features and the speed it can take photos. However I'm disappointed at the size of the videos, audio and very short battery life. I set the camera to 720P and recorded myself playing guitar for 10 minutes. I then loaded it onto my computer and noticed it took up 1.62GB of space. I compared this to a 10 minute 1080 video from my canon HD video camera and that only took up 800mb. There is no excuse why the 300 HS has to take up twice as much space on a ten minute video. For example the new flip video HD will record 2 Hours of HD video on only 8GB. If you recorded 2 hours on the 300HS at 720P (not even the highest setting) your looking at about 20GBs.  Also there should not be a time limit of ten minutes for the videos. It should let you continue recording until the memory card is full (I have a 32GB card in the camera). On the plus side the video looks great, the camera focuses great and I like the slow zoom when recording. Now the thing that bothers me more then the size of the video is the static sound. It actually picks up sound very good with no distortions but there is what I can only describe as a water fall sound in the background during my videos (and there was no other sounds in the room that would cause this). I can not use this camera to record my guitar lessons or demos seeing as the water fall sound just kills it. I also only got about 150 pictures and just a few videos before the battery went dead. I do have another one I keep with me but this seems a little fast. If canon could fix the static/waterfall sound during recording, bring down the file size of the videos and kick up the battyer life a little this would be a perfect little camera.", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Small and takes great pictures but doesn't last more than a week", "Author": "Brad M.

Really liked the SD870 for the manual controls, quality of low light pics, ISO good thru 800, manual controls and the sound on video (especially for concerts, sound is not distorted).So when I saw the ELPH 300HS was promising quality low light pics, HD video and the size (very small), not to mention the 5x Optical Zoom (who needs digital zoom), I thought now was a good time to buy next camera. Size and weight of camera are great, dont even know its in my pocket. Also the look and texture are great. The low light pics using one of Canon pre-set settings like Night Scene are pretty decent (Noise very limited). The HD video chews up memory and sound is very distorted. After couple uses I already lowered the Video Quality from 1920x1080, to 1280x720 or 640x480 just to save room on memory card. Believe 8gb of memory using 1920x1280 is about 15-20 min of video. I wont be using the video much anyway for what I would normal be using it for (Videos at clubs) cause sound is just unusable. For videoing Niece/Nephew/Family events etc sound is fine. Lastly battery life, i dont think the battery on my 870 ever died on me, unlike here where battery died on me twice in 1 w/e.

The Powershot 300 HS has surpassed my expectations. My other camera is a 7D and have a nice collection of flashes and lenses, but I got tired of lugging it around everywhere. With my son being born I knew I would be taking lots of photos but wanted to be able to take pictures at a moments notice and not have to set a bunch of equipment up all the time. Well this was the answer to all my needs. Being an intermediate/advanced level photographer I couldn't settle to have some cheap little point and shoot. So I researched and went with the top of the line canon. In a nutshell this thing is a pocket sized version of my 7D, no lens changing of course. It lets you set up everything manually if you want to, or it will do everything for you! I was very impressed to see the addition of 1080p at 24fps video as I didnt think these things had that capability. It also can do 240fps at 320x240 and 120fps at 640x480 which is a blast to play with. There are so many features in this thing its ridiculous, there's more then the websites will even tell you. It has lots of cool creative modes, some of my favorites are 1.Panorama Assist - which guides you in taking the pictures and will stitch them together with the packaged software when you load it to your computer. 2. color isolation mode - Lets you select a color and grey every other color out. 3. Smart Shutter Detection - You can set it to take a picture when it detects a smile, wink, or when a new face enters the frame. 4. High Speed Video mode - as mentioned earlier. 5. Miniature Mode - Maybe the most fun to play with, lets you pick your area of focus and blur the rest. Also lets you record movies that play back at fast speed (smaller video size but small file size too!). Other great features you'll notice right away are its slim design (wont even know its in your pocket), fast start up speed - ready to go in under about 1 second (just disable start up screen, and incredibly easy menu navigation. The greatest part of this camera is that I dont have miss another photo opportunity because I either didn't lug my camera with or couldn't get it out in time. This thing is always on me and ready to go. Being ready for the moment is half the battle:) Don't waste your money on some cheap camera, this thing will do you proud.

The SD400 is nearing its end, so I wanted a new small point and shoot to replace it.  I would never expect a new P&S; to even approximate the quality of my 7D, but I'd certainly expect more out of a couple generations of PowerShots.Unfortunately, I'm disappointed and will be sending the ELPH 300 back.The good: It's very small, sturdy, and constructed well.  The handling is quite nice with a powder-coated metal frame.  It powers on quickly and the menus are fairly easy to navigate.  The video modes are nice, too, with the 120fps 640x480 mode and 240fps 320x240 mode.  I'd probably never use them, but they're cool.  The newer PowerShots also support SDHC, so they work great with my 8GB Eye-Fi SD card.  The SD400, unfortunately, doesn't support over 2GB.The bad: A new camera isn't worth it if it doesn't exceed the quality of my old 5Mpixel SD400 and this one doesn't.  The auto white balance is poor and doesn't compare the SD400 in either flash or no-flash modes.  With my EOS 7D, I'll shoot in RAW and do post processing in Lightroom, but the point of a P&S; is to avoid those hassles.  I'd need to properly balance every picture taken so far with the ELPH 300.With 12 Mpixels, you'd expect pretty good images, but the problem is that the ELPH 300 compression is turned up so high that the sensor's acuity gets lost (softened) in compression.  Without a \"super-fine\" mode or at least a higher-quality fine mode, the best simply isn't good enough.  The 5 Mpixel images from the SD400 come pretty close to the acuity of the ELPH's images and are 1/3 the size.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "(4.5 stars) A very good point-and-shoot camera, available at a good price", "Author": "Snap, Crackle and Pop", "ReviewID": "R2MN4I1Q6U6VFD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THE QUICK TAKE:  The Canon ELPH 300 is a very good point-and-shoot camera.  The size makes it easy to carry, which means you're more likely to have it when you need it.  The 5x, almost-wide-angle optical lens provides flexibility while maintaining quality.  And while small cameras like this involve a number of compromises, Canon has made the right compromises.CARRY A REAL CAMERA:  Some people would argue that the camera on their phone means they don't need a point and shoot camera.  Ummmmm .... sort of.  It is great to always have a \"camera\" with you, so a phone does let you catch some photos you might miss.  But if you know you're traveling or going to an event - give yourself a chance to get some good pictures, carry a real camera (such as this one).  The photo quality is so much better than any phone, and it provides much more flexibility - to zoom, use flash, etc.THIS IS A VERY GOOD SMALL CAMERA:  The Canon ELPH 300 is a very small camera, about as small as a camera needs to be.  It's reasonably quick (except when you're taking a series of flash photos - but it's not unusual to need some time for the flash to recharge).  The photos generally have good exposure, focus and color balance.  The Auto selections are generally well made, though it doesn't seem to pick up on backlit subjects and force the flash on or otherwise adjust.  The flash works well enough for something this size.  HDMI output is nice to have.THE USUAL COMPROMISES, WELL BALANCED:  Small cameras have small lenses and small sensors.  Small lenses and small sensors capture less light, so perform best in bright light.  The processing and shooting modes help somewhat to address that.  (If you learn to use the Scene shooting modes in Program mode, that should help as well.)  Small lenses also don't have the sharpness of large lenses.  The extra megapixels of this sensor help a little with the sharpness - you're probably not printing 16x20 photos from these.  Overall, Canon has done a good job of balancing the inevitable compromises that come with a point and shoot camera.THINK ABOUT THE VIDEO SIZE:  While it's really cool to shoot 1080-line video, I'm not sure what I'd be able to do with that.  To reduce the file size and processing complexity, I've mostly been shooting 720-line.  That's still better than DVD-quality (480-line).By the way, the microphones seem to work well given the limitations of this type of camera.SOME ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT:  There are a couple areas that Canon could improve:- The biggest problem, and it is significant, is that sometimes highlights are washed out or lost altogether.  The dynamic range of the camera seems surprisingly limited.  So the face of a child laying in dark grass will lose a lot of detail.  So I'll be taking a more capable camera some of the time, to get better picture quality.- Mostly an annoyance, but an unnecessary one - you can choose to set the Review feature (how long a photo stays on the screen) for 2, 3, 4, etc seconds.  All are too long in real life shooting situations with any action.  How about half a second, or one second?- It seems you can't force the flash to fire, or force the camera into Macro mode (for close ups), unless you switch to Program mode.  That's an unnecessary extra step for very commonly used features.As far as the other reviewers disappointed by this camera, I can only think of three reasons:(1) They paid full list price.  It wasn't worth that, but at current prices (not much more than half that, look for a deal), it's a very good value.(2) They got a defective camera.  It does happen.(3) They're just not realistic about what to expect from a small camera.This is a very good, and in some ways remarkable camera, given what's possible with current technology.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera with a rough finish", "Author": "CDNAmazon", "ReviewID": "R16KIWFOE8OFN7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have not had the camera for long (2 weeks) but so far it's great.Pros:-Very compact.-Great video and photo quality.-Wide angle lens is the best and now a must in all my future point and shoot cameras.-Miniurature scene mode is fun to use-Slow motion video is also great.-Compact battery charger is genius when you compare to the charger I have for my Nikon (bulky charger with a 3 foot cord/ a pain in the rump to pack when travelling light).-Power on and ready to shoot is super fastCons:-getting to a scene mode in a hurry is difficult.

I'm going to start with the design.  I was glad they've added black in their color variation, but on this particular model the black is dull.  Not sure if it's matte black, but there's a texture on it that I don't quite like.  It feels alright when you've got slippery hands but the texture attracts dust like a moth to a flame.  I wish Canon would adopt some design ideas from Sony or Samsung.  The LCD screen feels like it's not secure, and if you look closely you can see the spaces between the lcd and the camera.  The bottom right of the screen kind of pops up and i dont really feel good about it.  I actually got a replacement because I thought the first one i had was a bad one, but the second one is just the same.  I'm in the process of returning the replacement for a refund.What I liked about this camera was the ease of use and how fast it operated.  The new HS system is really nice indeed.  I don't think i liked the CMOS sensor though.  It caused overexposure often, and colors were off and flat looking.  I always had to use Vivid color mode which on my previous Canon Powershot was extremely vivid and saturated but on the 300 HS it's normal colors.  I own a Canon T2i and a Panasonic LX3, i've tried numerous cameras in the past so I can say i know a thing or two about IQ. I am by no means a \"pro\" photog. I don't do \"portraits\" or those studio-like pictures but I am into still life and street photography.  The Elph 300 HS is good for snapshots.  Clear images with very minimal to no noise at all.  It does smear a bit but isn't as bad.  I wouldn't go above ISO800 though.  And the i-Contrast is just horrible, don't use it you wont need it.  The HD video is AMAZING, though the mic is super sensitive to wind so it's a little downside.  I don't record video anyway.  Most people who are getting this probably want it for low-light pictures.  I'd have to say the low light performance is better than a regular Canon Powershot SD but don't expect wonders because it still has a small sensor and an aperture that isnt wide enough. If you want anything close to dSLR quality images, you'll be better with any of the advanced p&s; like the Canon S95, Panasonic LX5, Olympus XZ1, Samsung EX1 etc.  All of those have a sensor of 1/1.7\" or bigger, and the Oly and Samsung have an aperture of 1.8!  Another thing i want to bring up is the inconsistency of the images.  The focus on this camera doesn't seem to be as effective as older models, so trying to shoot macro is a little bothersome because it takes several times for it to find the subject.  I think for the price, it should perform a little better.  My advice is to get the 100 HS and save $50, or spend a little more and get the SX210.  If you're looking for best image quality as an alternative to a dSLR then  you might want to get the advanced p&s; that i mentioned.  if you just want a camera to take snapshots and want decent IQ, you would be fine with any of the Canon A series, even the SD1300 and SD1400.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS 12 MP CMOS Digital Camera with Full 1080p HD Video (Black)", "Author": "Twanger", "ReviewID": "RFX04A99PKFNV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the money this is a good point-and-shoot camera with some great features.

Anything in the midground to background looks great* Great quality video* lots of fun settings for those not trained in photoshop (color editing, fisheye effect, vintage/toybox camera effect, etc etc)* delivers that rich, sometimes oversaturated quality of image that canon point-and-shoots are famous for.

I found the auto setting to be rather cumbersome and annoying at times.* The 300HS has some serious auto-focus problems, especially with the macro setting. Compared to my previous SD1100IS the 300HS is just plain bad. Even unmoving subjects go in and out of focus.

For shots that are difficult you can switch to manual mode and pick one of several presets for different conditions, or go fully manual and set the exposure, etc. directly. Every shot you'd expect a point & shoot to take, the 300HS takes well. As light levels go down, image quality degrades gracefully -- there are no surprises.

The 300HS is just a minor step up on paper, but everything works so much better -- the images are much sharper, the colors are better, no focusing problems, you can zoom during a video, and it refocuses as the subject moves during a video.Like all Canon Elphs, the camera easily fits in a shirt pocket. The 300HS has a textured finish that makes it less likely to slip out of said pocket.One nice feature is separate buttons for taking a still photo vs. recording a video, so you don't accidentally start a video when you think you're taking a photo and vice versa. A cool feature is slow motion video -- great for analyzing a runner's stride, a golf swing, or just for fun.Minor complaints: You can trim a video clip but there's no way to join two adjacent video clips. The microphones are on the top edge of the camera so I often accidentally cover them with my finger. The 10-minute HD recording limit may prevent you from videoing your kid's school play (though 640x480 records up to an hour).

There was a high volume of overwhelmingly positive reviews, and my previous camera was a 6-year-old Canon Powershot A620. Any new camera would be an improvement, right? While the low-light photos definitely came out better than with my A620 (not great, but better), I felt that, on a whole, my old camera took photos that were much more clear and crisp. While I loved that the ELPH 300's size and weight made it easy for me to tote around, and I found the camera itself easy to use and navigate, I was very disappointed in the quality of the photos. I tested the camera out in multiple environments and on multiple settings, but around 90% of the photos were unsatisfactory. The photos looked great on the screen, but as soon as I uploaded them to the computer I saw that none of them were actually crisp. To be fair, many of my photos were taken in low-light settings and without flash which already makes for less crisp photos. However, for a camera that boasted being able to take better photos in low-light settings, I don't feel like it delivered. I did play around with many of the settings: changing the iso, utilizing the tungsten or fluorescent light setting, etc. and while on the camera screen the photos appeared great, again, as soon as I uploaded the photos to the computer I saw that I was mislead. FYI, my camera/card was set to the largest size and highest quality photos so that wasn't the issue.I am unsure as to why I couldn't get more than a few good (not great) photos with this camera, since there are so many positive reviews (not to mention great photos uploaded by users) for this camera. I might have received a lemon, or it might be error on my part; but seeing as how I have already spent a great deal of time and effort trying to get the best out of this camera (which is supposed to already take good photos without ANY effort), I think there is a problem here.I originally intended to purchase the ELPH 100, but opted for the 300 instead because so many more people had [positively] reviewed it, and because even though I was paying more, I was saving more off of the original price. However, $150 for a camera that I do not love is more than I am willing to pay. While I would love to only pay $100 for a camera, it doesn't seem like there is a great option in that price range (if the ELPH 300 failed me, I am assuming the ELPH 100 will as well). I would rather pay more for a camera I love. After almost 4 weeks of trying to work with this camera, I have decided to return it. I have since ordered the Canon Powershot sx230 (as high as I'm willing to pay for a point-and-shoot at this time, otherwise I would have gone for the Canon Powershot sd90 which seems like a safe bet) and after only a few hours of toying around with it, I am already much more impressed. Even with the 14x zoom (which is a definite perk), the photos have been coming out more crisp than the ones I took with the ELPH 300. I find it most helpful to read reviews for comparable items left by the same person, so once I decide for sure whether or not I am happy with the sx230, I will leave a review for it, as well as modify my review here.*update 1/5/12I still have only had the Canon sx230 for a few weeks, but I will absolutely not be returning it!! It has lived up to, and exceeded my expectations. I see that the most recent reviews for the elph300 are positive so I'm not sure where the disconnect is between their experiences and mine. If you bought the elph300 and are happy with it, great; but if not, I highly recommend the sx230!", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not the smallest but the biggest in value", "Author": "Samuel Chell", "ReviewID": "R2SPC0LVC9ICOF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon's pronouncements for this camera practically holler out that it's the \"thinnest in the world!\"  Sorry, but Canon's SD-780, which is now out of production but still selling on Amazon, takes honors as the company's smallest in height, width, and breadth.  So if bragging rights are important to you, be prepared to pony up twice as much for the SD-780 (which has become an \"appreciating asset\").  I loved my 780 before I lost it but was not about to pay twice as much to replace it.  The Canon Elph 300 marks a return on the part of the company to the qualities that made their Canon SD 1000-1200 subcompacts as well as the SD-780 the runaway favorites, if not only choice, among \"casual\" consumers looking for a convenient but capable point-and-shoot subcompact.To my eyes, the 300's photos are every bit as good as the SD-780's, while the 5X-power lens makes it more flexible and useful than the 3X-power lens of the SD-780, which didn't qualify as having either a wide-angle or a telephoto lens.  I see some reviewers expressing regret that the 300 doesn't boast even more megapixels than 12. But the enthusiasts and pros (or serious photographers who insist on a genuine SLR monster) are demanding fewer megapixels, not more.  16 mps won't necessarily get you better resolution or sharper pictures but it will eat up all the space on your memory card in a hurry, especially if you use the very good video capabilities of either of these cameras.  As a result, the higher-end \"bigger\" cameras are now likely to compromise at 10 megapixels rather than chase a popular consumer market obsessed with higher numbers.The 300 has few manual over-rides and is unlikely to satisfy someone hoping to win top honors in a photo-shoot.  But it's a dependable yet versatile little thing (with 1080p video and a stereo mic!) that's user-friendly, intuitive, and a quick read (some of the manuals with the bigger cameras require months of studying).  If you need further assurance, pick up Consumer Reports Buying Guide for 2012.  Out of 139 sub-compact cameras, the Canon Elph 300 comes in 9th place.  (The Canon S95 places 2nd out of the 139, but it'll cost you at least twice the price of the Canon Elph 300.  On the other hand, the Leica V-Lux 20 will cost you more than 4 X more than the Canon 300, yet it's rated lower by CR, which places it in the 10th spot.)There are those who will pay these inflated premiums in order to claim that they own the world's smallest camera (the Elph 780) or that theirs is a, gasp, \"Leica\"!  I'm happy to give them that advantage and simply enjoy the shots I'm getting from this pocket rocket (definitely superior to my wife's iPhone).  If you're a \"serious\" photographer looking for a \"side-kick\" accessory camera, or if you're looking for a camera that will last for a good while under adverse conditions, the Canon S95 subcompact may be the better choice if you can afford it.  It has a lens of \"only\" 10 megapixels, and video resolution of \"only\" 780 pixels.  But fastidious photographers know that those numbers are merely manufacturer's consumer \"bait.\"  The S95 would definitely appear to be the better-built camera with more user-accessible, manual features than the fully automated, lightweight, slightly smaller 300.  There are copious examples of shots taken from both cameras on the web--dpreview, steves-digicams, cnet, etc.  I've studied them and frankly don't see consistently superior image quality from the S95 when comparing it to the 300. So the S95 represents an \"investment\" in a more rugged, hobbyist camera, for someone who shoots RAW and fusses around in Photoshop.Since photography is no longer my main focus in life, I'm content with the performance of the 300 and am simply hoping it holds up as well as an S95.  As for the world's thinnest camera, the 300 is .8\" thin; the discontinued SD-780 was/is .7\" thin.  Not enough of a difference to motivate me to replace my prodigal, long-lost, once-lamented Elph 780.  The 300 has already erased lingering regrets over its absence.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good price nice cam.", "Author": "J. E.

Plus, portable point and shoot with fun modes built in. The video quality is comprable to the pocket HD cams, and it is smaller than the pocket HD cam I had before.  I am still surprised at the size.  It is smaller than my smartphone.I'm having trouble in lower light settings with all functions of the camera, but I'm still learning it.  The camera isn't as intuitive as I hoped, but as soon as I figured out where all the menus were I was more or less good to go and play around.Currently the amazon info says it has creative light \"Creative Light Effect Transform background bright spots to stars, hearts, music motes and more.\" I was looking forward to this, but I haven't been able to find it, and it isn't listed as a shooting mode on the canon site.  That makes me a little bit sad.  One of the other things that isn't clear from the camera info is that you cannot shoot slow motion in HD (240fps is 320 and 120fps shoots at 640) and there is no audio.  Not the end of the world given all the other things the camera does, but again, something I was hoping to play with that I won't be able to.Overall the quality is what I would expect given the price.  I am still in awe of the tiny size and weight.  It really does fit in my pocket.

I become more and more disappointed in this camera as time goes by. Just reviewed loads of photos from this summer/fall and I hate to say it, but -- they suck! My former Canon AS1100 (vintage 2008) took photos soooooo much better than thing. Interior shots are especially bad, whether flash is used or not. I figured to take this camera on a long international journey, but forget it. The photos are that disappointing. I did take the AS1100 on a long international journey (six months in Africa) and its photos were awesome. One even won a photo contest. The AS1100 hd a CCD sensor and the Elph 300 a CMOS -- that's the thing.So, I guess I'll be shopping for a new camera in the next few months. :(EDIT: I originally gave this 5 stars. Well, after shooting many photos under a variety of conditions during a recent vacation, I have to drop it to 4 stars. Using the camera's Auto mode, on many shots, the image quality is poor to mediocre. I assumed Auto mode image quality would be superior to the last two (and less expensive) Nikon and Canon point and shoots I have owned, but that is definitely not the case. Auto mode images tend to be soft and faint and not realistic, e.g., grass is a faint green, not the rich green of healthy grass. Pretty disappointing! To get the most from this camera, you have to use Program mode and set ISO at 100 or 200, and experiment with the manual white balance settings. Then photos come out much better, with improved quality and richness and color accuracy. Unfortunately, the camera doesn't allow you to apply custom ISO and WB settings to various scene modes, like Foliage or Fisheye.ORIGINAL: One of the best things about this camera is its 24 mm wide angle lens. This is wider than the 28mm lens that is standard on most pocket-sized point and shoots (and the Elph 100, a step down from the Elph 300) and it is very cool. If you're not familiar with how 24 mm vs. 28 mm compares, do a little Googling. It's outstanding for landscape shots and group shots and makes photos more engaging and descriptive, with no downside. Great move, Canon!The small size of the camera is fantastic. Pocketability and performance are very nicely balanced in this well built and well designed camera. It was good to see Canon back out of the megapixel war and reduce the megapixels on this model to 12.1, from 14 in its predecessor (the SD 1400). With the 5x optical zoom, CMOS sensor (vs. CCD), HD video and an impressive palette of shooting options, there's a lot to like in this little gem.One peculiarity is that the volume on video playback on the camera is extremely low. It's difficult to hear if you're playing back videos on the camera. It's a lot lower than another Canon point and shoot that I used for a few years. I think I have it adjusted to the max, though I have to take a closer look at the manual. Which leads me to ...Raspberries to Canon for not including a full user manual booklet. Since when has it become acceptable to sell a product without providing the customer with an easy means of learning how to use it? (I know, lots of mfr's do it but still). I travel extensively for months on end with a point and shoot and refer to the manual fairly often. If I want to look up some detail or just browse, I could just grab the manual from my pack over a cup of coffee. Does Canon expect me to lug around a printout of the full PDF manual? It's not always convenient to have a netbook running and use the manual on it. Nor is it as enjoyable or instructive as flipping through a book.Though I can see some logic in not providing a full booklet and am all for not wasting paper, I would be happy if Canon made available for purchase a proper user manual for $10 or $12 or whatever.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Trade up to this very nice camera", "Author": "Jackerson", "ReviewID": "RBT1T37SQNOZB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There were five things that attracted me to replace my ELPH 1100IS (which I consider one of the best of the point-and-shoots at its time) with the 300 HS: 12 MP, 24mm wide angle, 5x zoom, Image Stabilization, and new High Sensitivity CMOS sensor.  Lesser features were the HD movie mode and burst still shots.  The camera delivers all these very well except the 12MP, which I'll get to later.  The controls are slightly different from the traditional ELPH cameras.  The 300 HS has a dedicated movie button (so you don't accidentally take a movie in the middle of the old slide control), and a dedicated Review button (which allows you to switch back and forth between the Shooting and Review mods much more easily).  There is a mode 'switch' to select between AUTO, and Manual.Strangely, I get higher resolution pictures with the AUTO mode than any of the (MANY) Manual modes.  For example, in the Best Image Selection mode, I get a resolution of 900 Line Widths per Picture Height, where in the AUTO mode I get 2,000 LW/PH.  This is due manly to the Best Image Selection pictures being shot at 1984 x 1488 instead of 4000 x 3000 pixels.  However, with the 1100 IS I got 1,800 LW/PH.  Mathematically, the 12MP 300HS should have gotten 22% better resolution than the 8MP 1100IS, but only gets about 11% better resolution.  Maybe this is because the relatively small lens of the point-and-shoot cannot resolve the pixels on the chip.Image Stabilization seems to be improved over the 1100, and the CMOS sensor is noticeably more sensitive than the 1100IS.  This (and the improved IS) result in sharper pictures in low light, because they are taken at higher shutter speeds and ISO levels.There a few 'gotchas'.  The rocker switch is slightly recessed and harder to operate.  To select ISO Lock (for taking panorama pictures) one must first select the Manual switch, activate the Function Set, and select the Program mode.  All this was not required in the 1100IS.

It takes decent pictures and video and the zoom feature works while taking video. I bought this as an upgrade for the Canon SD730IS which I have used a lot over the last few years. I would simply carry it around in my pocket and even on my bike rides.  I even dropped the 780IS once while on the bike and, while it got scratched up a bit, it still works to this day.  There are some scratches on the back...However, the 300HS (Black) has really soft metal on the front face as part of the lens structure -- those 3 outer rings you see which are part of the mechanism that allows the lens to extend outward.  After one short trip where I put this camera in my pocket along with my Droid Incredible phone, the camera now has a bunch of dents in these surfaces.  The lens still extends outward as needed, but I'm sickened to see it all messed up so quickly. It looks as it has been badly abused.  The front face of my 780IS is still in tact with several places of missing paint on the rear side.So, I'm NOT a happy camper here. Beware of this camera.  Don't put it in your pocket or purse, or let it make contact with anything. It needs a case which, IMO, takes away the advantage of its small size.

I bought this and returned it a couple weeks later; I found the image quality to not be very good, images (even taken outside in good light) were noisy, washed out looking, bad colors, not sharp. It would really be great to be able to buy a compact, pocketable camera that takes good photos; you can't expect dSLR quality, but hopefully decent, acceptable quality. Unfortunately, I don't think this is possible. Basically, from my investigations, the key ingredient to getting good photo quality is to have a large sensor (e.g. read here: [...]). And in considering previous cameras I have owned and liked the photo quality of (e.g. Kodak V1073, Kodak C875, HP PhotoSmart 945), they all had larger than average sensors (not dSLR sized, but bigger than the 1/2\"3 that is used on this camera and many other compact cameras and it made a noticeable difference in quality to me). Anyway, I still don't really want to have to buy a huge dSLR and have to lug it around. There are some intermediate level cameras that have large sensors but aren't so big as dSLRS (but bigger than compacts like this one). For example, the Sony NEX line looks promising. Also, the Samsung NX100 looks good too (and seems very reasonably priced). You can easily find the image sensor size of cameras at the web site dpreview.Another, separate gripe I had about this camera is that, while you can take panoramic photos (i.e. take multiple snapshots and have them stitched together into a larger panorama photo), the stitching is NOT done in the camera --- you have to upload the separate photos to your computer and use an external piece of software to do the stitching. What a hassle! Digicams have been doing in-camera stitching of panoramas for years, why can't this camera?Also note that while you can take full HD video with this, it is only 24 frames per second and you are limited to about a max of 10 minutes per clip. By contrast the Sony DSC-WX9 (which I also was considering) can take 60 frames per second full HD video and there is no time limit.

I've had it for two days now so I'm giving my first impressions. As time goes by, I'll flesh out my review. And this point of view is from someone who has only used point and shoot cameras, by the way. :)Why I bought it - I wanted a more powerful point and shoot camera. I'm still very much a novice photographer but I do like having quality shots, especially for such events as weddings, graduations, bdays, and everyday outings. Originally I wanted the S95 but saw that the new PS ELPH 300 HS had comparable specs and was powerful but still had a simple design. $250 is the most I've paid for a camera but also cheaper than the S95. Nonetheless, I saw this purchase a long term investment of sorts!Design layout - the black model looks sleek, is thin and very pocketable. It doesn't weigh down my purse at all. It has a rougher material design rather than the smooth metal surface I'm used to, which is a nice change. I feel like a get a better grip on the camera which is already so small. Overall, I like the design.Button layout - Having owned two digital cameras in the past (Sony and Fujifilm) I didn't have a hard time figuring out what buttons do and the menu system. Low learning curve overall. And nothing reading through the manual can't help. :)Image/video quality - I've been playing with the different effects (fisheye and miniature are cool), video shooting (1080p HD and you can zoom during filming), macro mode, different aspect ratios (square mode, 16:9), indoor, outdoor, flash, etc. Very happy/impressed with the quality. Shots turn out very clear and crisp and you can see a lot of detail in the photographs- even in macro mode, which has been terrible in my old cameras!To be continued.

The camera arrived quickly (at the early end of the expected delivery window) and was carefully packaged. I charged up the battery and 45 minutes later got to work.I got the black finish option. It isn't a smooth finish, but a little rough, like fine-grit sandpaper. I really like it because the camera is quite small in stature, and the finish allows for a sure grip at all times. After a brief initial set-up (set date/time and select language) I started snapping some shots in auto-mode. Wow, what a clean picture. I came from a 6 mega-pixel point and shoot, so 12 mega-pixel unit is a healthy upgrade. Pictures are sharp, balanced and vibrant, even in the low lighting around my place. I stepped outside and snapped a few more in the sunlight and found more of the same.Having mastered auto-mode (and who can't really?) I opened up the menu and started playing with some of the features. I've seen some reviews complain that putting the camera into a particular mode is too cumbersome, and I have a couple thoughts on that. Number one, the menu is optimally set up, easy to read and navigate. Icons illustrate the various modes, with text alongside to explain what each mode is and what it does. Selecting a mode was simple. Number two, as far as selecting a mode on the fly, any pro photographer will tell you one of the secrets to taking great pictures is planning ahead. I really don't know what Canon could do to make it any faster, other than assigning individual buttons on the camera for each mode, and that's not exactly feasible. Several features are included, so unleash your creativity! Video mode is nice as well, easy to use and shoots great video.Only two negatives I can think of for this purchase is something that plagues too many electronics when buying online. I want to know exactly what's in the box, and I couldn't find that anywhere in the product description. I ordered an SD card along with my purchase and I'm glad I did, because one is not included with the camera (that may very well be standard procedures these days, but I'm pretty sure my old Canon came with a card). So I will tell you what IS in the box: camera, manuals, cd-rom, RCA cable to connect with a tv, USB cable, one battery, and one wall-charger. The second drawback is that the LCD display screen is a bit exposed. In this small package space is a premium and it seems like the screen is pushed outward a little to compensate. I'm looking forward to the arrival of my protective case.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. Tons of features, easy to use, excellent pictures and a great price.

Wide angle starts at 24mm for 300 HS, whereas, it's 28mm for 310 HS/510 HS.

Otherwise, it has same excellent Digic 4 processor and fabulous 1080 HD video and same excellent CMOS sensor that does better in low light.The camera is fast, responsive, focuses quickly and very portable.  People with big hands may not like this model since it is tiny.  You can zoom while shooting video, which is a plus. Pictures are fine compared to other small sensored P&S; cameras.

I'm going from an SD630 and hands down, this beats it. I even had an SX210IS and these images are on par with it, if not better. I had to return my SX210IS as it had issues with dust on the image sensor and I've been waiting for a new P&S; class to come out. I bit the bullet on this camera and what can I say - I am happy!300HS vs 500HS:There is a 500HS version of the camera, which is approx $50 more. To this point, the only differences I can tell are the LCD on the back as well as aperture priority and shutter priority, while the 300hs does not. The touch screen on the 500hs can also be used to focus on a particular subject. The 500hs also has a wider aperture at 2.0, the 300hs has 2.7.Form Factor/Display:Small. Awesome. There is a texture on the camera, I really like this as it seems like it will help if you hands are wet (sweat, snow, etc). Easy to operate one hand and if using both hands, flash isn't in a horrible place. Display is very bright and button seem intuitive as with other Canon cameras. Battery and SD are on the bottom door, USB and HDMI are in a covered side port. Comes with a wrist strap if you desire a little extra security.Boot Time/Software:Camera is ready to take photos very fast. From the time you press the button, it's pretty much set to catch the action. Time between photos wasn't terrible (about 1.5 seconds) and if you need it, there is continuous shot mode. Had no problem with the Canon software on Windows 7. I've used the Canon Photo Window import for a while, does a good job of getting photos off the camera without duplicates. I use Picasa to then manage my photo library (I skip the Zoom Browser, but it's really not bad if you want to use it, I'm just a slave to Google/gmail)Computer Connectivity:I didn't find this anywhere in the specs, so if you're looking, the camera uses mini-USB, similar to all Canon's that have come out over the last few years.Optical Zoom:You're going to be impressed with the form factor of this camera and it's 5x OPTICAL zoom. I immediately disabled digital zoom as 12.1MP + 5x Optical will get you very close to the action. You're better off digitally enhancing the photos later on.Battery + Memory Card:This uses the NBL-4 (again, I found confusion on this and accessories) - so if you have some of those laying around keep them as they'll work just fine in this camera. This is nice as my SD630 uses the NBL-4 so now I have 2 chargers + 3 batteries. It took my 16GB SDHC (Sandisk Ultra) without any issues and holds thousands of images. Images have tended to be between 2 and 3mb on the highest settings.Image Quality:Look, I'm no photo fanatic, I don't expect the people buying this camera are. I am looking for solid images and this camera delivers. There are a ton a feature you can delve into and I'm sure they are good. It has manual mode, so if you fancy that, you can go down that path. But I'm the type of person that knows when something looks good, OK or great. This camera consistently delivers GREAT photos. I'm happy with the low light and images aren't blurry or grainy (within reasonable expectations).Video:FINALLY! Optical zoom on a Canon during video! 1080p brings this camera up to par with others in its class and it does a decent job. I didn't notice any major noise when zooming in and out while recording video. I know this is the excuse Canon has used in the past as to why they never had this feature. It shoots nice clips for those quick moments. This will NOT replace a true DV cam, but hey, for a few minute clips here and there, you will simply not be dissapointed.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera with a slight quirk", "Author": "R. Cheney", "ReviewID": "R3UWC7OAPLJGRT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for a recent vacation trip, and it worked quite well.  Found that some pictures taken without the flash in low light conditions actually came out a great deal better than when using the flash.  Not sure how it works that way, but definitely a plus.  Less use of the flash means more battery time.  The fully charged Canon battery would last for about 250 pictures before needing replacing.For those who have had problems with the lens shutters not closing completely, here is your probable problem and solution, as I encountered the same issue.  The metal that covers the lens shutter assembly is very thin, and very easily bent.  If the camera is set face down on a non-flat surface, or pushed up against something, it could easily tweak the metal lens cover.  When the lens shutters on my camera suddenly stopped closing completely, I took a closer look at the camera.  With the camera on, and looking down at the lens from the top of the camera, I could see that the metal covering the lens shutter assembly was slightly pushed in.  This was causing the lens shutters to catch, and not close completely.What I did was to grab a miniature flathead screwdriver, and carefully slide it between the lens and the metal cover.  Do not slide the screwdriver head across the lens, as this could scratch the lens.  With a minimal amount of upward pressure, I was able to straighten out the bent section of the metal.  Do NOT leverage the screwdriver against the lens, as this could scratch it as well.  Just gently lift the screwdriver with a slight pressure applied.  Since doing this quick and easy fix, I have had absolutely no problem with the lens shutters, and both repeatedly close completely.It took a few minutes to get used to how the camera functions were laid out in the menu, but once accustomed, making changes is quick and easy.  Pictures came out great, focusing happens quite quickly.  If Canon would use a slightly thicker metal over the lens assembly, I think that that would resolve many of the lens shutter issues, and they would have many more happy customers.In spite of this one quirk, I am very happy with this camera, and would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends and family.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Way over rated!", "Author": "David M Dodson", "ReviewID": "R3JJERIH21PPNU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My trusty Canon SD630 starting to get a little worn so I decided to upgrade to a similar sub-compact point and shoot. The Elph 300Hs is almost identical in size to the older SD630 with a few more rounded edges.  Right away it felt a little slippery in my hands but I liked the fact I could use the same case, battery charger, and battery as my old camera.  The menu system has been revised from older Canons but all things considered if felt pretty familiar.My first use was in a trip in the mountains.  The outdoor shots in Auto mode were just ok and frankly I was a little disappointed with the sharpness and detail. Everything had a washed out appearance (which I recognized as overexposure later) The real problems started when I took the camera to my son's wedding. The auto mode produced horrible pictures. Overexposure (noted by some reviews) was present in almost all shots. In some cases I took shots within a second of each other with the same scene and the Auto setting drastically changed.  ISO, aperture, speed was all over the place.  I ended up switching to program settings to fix the ISO at 100, keep the flash on, changed to vivid, and fiddled with the exposure.  This helped a little but I still was not happy, especially since I expect a point and shoot to work well in Auto. I then tried some more fixed settings with higher ISO and no flash to take advantage of the sensitivity.  I can honestly say the results were worse than my cell phone camera.  Giving up I switched back to Auto for the rest of the wedding and ended up taking many bad pictures with motion artifacts, overexposure, out of focus, you name it.This camera may have been defective but I don't think so. After doing some more research it seems that these CMOS sensors my not quite be ready for prime time.  I sent the camera back and upgraded to the Canon S95. I could not be happier!  The S95 takes amazing pictures in auto mode and is a lot of fun to try out some of the manual options.Do not get fooled by all the positive 300HS reviews. This camera is not worth the high price.  You would be much better off going more high end with the S95 or just buying a cheaper point and shoot and saving some money.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon ELPH 300HS or the Canon SX40HS? What are you using the camera for?", "Author": "Ethan Winning \"Ethan Winning\"", "ReviewID": "R3U82N295AA5W5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Someone recently asked whether they should get the SX40 for shooting pictures of the family, kids at play, and spur of the moment fun happenings. Since I have the SX40, and use it exclusively and almost always for nature photography, I don't usually like to give advice on what someone SHOULD buy. However, I also have the Canon PS Elph 300 HS and the older Canon PowerShot SD1100IS (Elph), and for parties and quick grab-and-shoot photography, I can whole-heartedly recommend the Elph 300 HS.My advice (and now I've been asked 7 times about a comparison of the two cameras):People aren't my forte. I much prefer bugs, bunnies, bees, bear, butterflies, and birds. For spur of the moment shots of family - from parties to candid shots of the kids (grandkids) - I prefer the ELPH 300 HS which also has 1080p HD Video. It's the kind of camera that you can just take with you or have in your pocket, and it's also small enough to have just lying around the house and to grab quickly.The SX40HS is also good for family activities, but I think it may be more camera than you need or would want. It weighs 24 ounces (including battery) and is just slightly less bulky than a DSLR. You can use it for high definition videos, but unlike the Elph, it's unwieldy and I suggest a tripod. I don't think a tripod is necessary for vids with the Elph: it's so light (5 ounces!), all you need is a relatively steady hand.If you are going to take videos, get an extra battery.IF you want to get into nature photography (see my noncommercial nature photo site), but don't want a DSLR, and if you're willing to go through the learning curve, then I might suggest the SX40. But we have two Elphs and for a quick grab and shoot, it's the one I'd recommend. Btw, it has a fantastic lens. The pix are sharp and all you have to learn is composition (which eludes some people).I can't make the decision for you, but from what you've described, the SX40 is just more camera than what you'll need and it might just lie around because it's too much trouble. The Elph has a lot of capability, but the great thing is that it will fit into any pocket and it will give you great pictures. And, btw, some of my landscapes and a few of my butterflies were taken with my wife's Elph. At times I actually prefer it for macros.And you'd be saving about $150.EW", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quickly became my favorite camera/pocket camcorder.", "Author": "Optopreneur", "ReviewID": "R221QZR6RJJ8SG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera about 6 months ago to take pictures and video of my 2 little girls.  I have a glutton of point-and-shoot cameras and pocket camcorders, however, this camera quickly became my favorite.  In fact I hardly use anything else and have gotten rid of all my pocket camcorders (flip mino, kodak Zi8 and playsport).  I would characterize myself as an amateur photographer and take mostly family pictures and videos.  To my eyes, the picture quality is very good and close to the quality of my Canon S95 (auto mode).  I actually prefer this camera to my S95 because it is more portable and a lot faster.  The S95 takes longer to start up and the lag between shots are longer, which is not advantages when you are trying to take pictures of kids.  It also has a dedicated video button making it as convenient as any pocket camcorder.  The features I enjoy most about the 300HS sre the wide angle lens and the HD video mode.  It captures great video with stereo sound.  The quality is definitely better than my Kodaks and Flip.  I also like the fact that with the wide angle lens I am able to capture more the action which comes in handy when filming clips of my daughters.Now for the cons: 1) Price.  At retail price it cost more than most point-and-shoots but I would say it is still a good value. If you are like me and like to take pictures and videos, it is worth the cost not to have to manage the battery, the memory and carry around multiple devices.  2) Heat. It does get a bit hot after 10 minutes of recording videos. I do take a lot of video clips so I am a bit concern about whether this will shorten the life of the camera.  3) Battery life.  It is decent if you are just taking pictures but if you are taking videos, you have to remember to charge it after each outing.I would recommend this camera for the casual photographer who is also likes to take short video clips.", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Blurry", "Author": "Koa", "ReviewID": "R20USRFV94UM6P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera was purchased to shoot snowboarding jumps and Hawaiian vacation trips.

The matte black finish is stylish and makes holding the camera very comfortable. As always, the menus on the Canon cameras are easy to navigate and get in and out of. The HD video capability of the camera is fantastic--it blows my HD Flip camera out of the water. It is a nice looking, easy to use camera.Cons:The auto-focus AI on this camera is the worst I have ever used, and is the reason for the 2 star rating. Even in full sunlight, with center-focus selected as the focus mode, the camera will rarely produce a crisp, well-focused image. The intelligent focusing modes are even worse, rarely detecting faces or relevant focal points. The battery life is also very poor. A fully charged battery will last about a day of hiking and photo taking. If you are traveling, don't forget your charger. Low expectations are a given for a point and shoot camera, but it should at least be able to focus properly.I have had several point and shoot digital cameras over the last decade or so, and this is bar far the least satisfying of them all.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "As Good As It Gets", "Author": "true review", "ReviewID": "RW9IAMYANW9TX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is awesome, especially for the price I got it for ($110 including shipping, not from Amazon), but even for a buck-fifty, it'd be worth it.It's fantastically small; the first camera I feel OK about putting into my pocket with my phone, as long as the camera has some protection.  The thing is a camera, not a phone - it's not designed to take as much abuse - if you carry it with no covering, you do so at your own self-inflicted peril.  It's not Canon's fault so many people don't know that dropping a camera on the ground can break it.  I thought that was pretty common knowledge since the 19th century.The look and feel is awesome.  Mine is black, and I love how it feels like it's coated in fine-grit sandpaper.  It looks slick without being shiny and has a great grip compared to other point-and-shoots where you are left gripping with four fingers.  The texture is really an added bonus to this camera; they did it right.  I've had people pick it up and say it feels like it's made of \"cheap plastic,\" but I think it's because of the small size and light weight, combined with the foreign feel of the camera, itself.  I've never felt a piece of electronic equipment made to feel like sandpaper before.  I love it.Being small, it still has a sizable screen, and I love the 24mm lens; I compared it, side-by-side, to my Canon SD1200IS, and the depth is really amazing.  The field of view is significantly closer to the actual viewpoint (your eyes have a serious wide-angle on them).  At the same time, the zoom gives it the capability to bring it closer, as long as you don't push it too far - pushing beyond the 5x point (it will digitally enhance up to 20x) results in pretty noisy images.  The video is fantastic, other than the Full HD; the camera just doesn't have the capability to record it smoothly enough.  720p is perfectly smooth but if you move the camera at all in 1080p, the video will be distractingly choppy.  But, in Auto mode, within the standard zoom range, in anything other than 1080p, this camera is smarter than I am.  There is almost no reason to leave Auto mode, which was not the case with my SD1200IS (I was never in Auto on that camera) - you can use this camera touching only two buttons: the shutter and the video button.  However, there is a flaw to this camera...The Program mode is an absolute nightmare.  This marks the first time I have ever had to read a user manual for a camera, in 25 years of using pocket cameras.  They really shouldn't be this hard to figure out.  If you want to do anything other than point, shoot, and adjust ISO/lighting/resolution, you'd better get ready to learn an entirely new interface.  It's like an electronic maze.  Changing shooting modes (other than the basic macro/landscape) or changing video (like the slow motion and \"4 second video capture\" whenever you take a picture) is truly so challenging that it took me hours to get it all right and days before I could do it without checking the manual.  And I'm a techno junkie.  So, that's a place where Canon really dropped the ball.  The included hard-copy manual is pathetic but the one on the included CD is fantastic, with a hotlinked TOC - why they couldn't make the camera as user-friendly as their manual, I do not know.Overall, you're not going to do better than this camera, for less than $200.  It's a year old and it still beats 2012 cameras that are priced at $300.  Bottom line is this: if you like taking pictures/video enough so that your smartphone makes you angry, this is the perfect camera for you, as long as you never take it out of Auto.", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Product improvement...", "Author": "D.

I always have bought and recommended canon to anyone from an expert to a newbee to the photography. The product didn't come with memory card to buy any size over 4GB and makes sure class 10 for sure. The product has everything else that you need in the box.Let's begin with Quality of Product coz a lot say it look cheap and blah blah blah.... I bought Silver color of this Model. I opened the box and It was well packed in a foam bag. I slide it out.... and WOOOOWWWW!!!! I took a deep breath and wanted to yell. It had AMAZINGLY UNBELIVEBLY EXCELLENT FINISHING. The camera looked really good and great. In no way/aspect it looks cheaper. The size is so compact and thin. My friend was with me when I opened it and she was like WOW so cute small camera. She also bought it. So imagine if a person can just buy the camera looking at it, it's got to look great and good finishing.Now let's go to the photography part: I clubbed it with my Transcend 8GB class 10 memory which I bought separately with it. I have to say the memory is sufficient and photos that I took and transferred were great. The ZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM is like I have written. You can see clear things from a distance without any distortion (but don't try to shoot moon from this camera). Anyways the Video part wow I was spell bounded by the stability feature no pixilation of any part and yes FULL HD 1080p. I connected it to see it on a projector through an HDMI cable. I saw it on 105 inch screen and then in my conference hall HD projector and no pixilation anywhere. It comes with Video zoom to good and stabilized level with a great video output. The camera offers a zoom of 5X and if you push further it offers 20X zoom and NO PIXILATION at all. Stabilty factor remains true and yes I can read and see everything clearly.So I would say forget this camera looking Cheap or plastic. It looks CLEAN, EXCELLENT, EXPENSIVE AND GREAT VALUE.The usage of menu is very easy and simple just like previous canons. Has been updated and looks better and easy to move and select options. No messing around and getting confused with the touch options. I have tried touching camera menu on different camera and believing me every time clicked something else so this is good with buttons to press and manage. Only I wish it had Panoramic Photo click ability.Comes with feature rich in it I didn't even have had time to use all but wanted to write this review to make sure if someone is planning to buy this and drops out thinking looks cheap may be give it another thought.

On line I found the red and gray, and they are smooth textured, much better.  I ordered the red from another retailer as they had a free case with purchase.Very nice, well built camera, made in Japan which usually indicates more quality.  Auto is great for quick shots and most use, many settings also available for more experienced photographers.  The auto focus can focus on something other than what you want, if that happens, switch the button on the back from auto down to the camera icon, choose P mode and set the focus to Center (check owner's manual for full instructions).  It will stay that way so anytime you want to better control focus all you'll have to do is switch the button down.Nice clear, colorful pictures.

I liked having a single device that took good photos and video, but I wanted to start recording home videos in HD.  I also didn't like a couple limitations of the SD1100's video recording (no zoom, fixed focal length).  I considered an upgrade to the SD1400, but it doesn't support full HD and still has the same basic video limitations (focal length is fixed for duration of recording although digital zoom is enabled).  The 10 minute limit on video files doesn't bother me much because most of our home movies are recorded in small increments.After watching some sample videos other users posted online, we decided to step up to the 300 HS.  I bought 2 16 GB memory cards and took the camera on our trip to Orlando.  We recorded about 45 minutes of full HD video and about 250 pictures on a single 16 GB card.  The battery life was OK, but we certainly needed to recharge several times on the trip.  After getting home, I took a look at what we got.  The video is very good.  The image and sound are both very clear.  I don't hear any camera noises in any of the video although there was plenty of ambient sound which could have covered it up.  Occassionaly the video has a tendency to \"jump\" when the camera is panning or zooming but it wasn't frequent (panning/zooming slowly seems to help).  I'm so glad we swtiched to this camera for the sake of the improved video quality we got.As for the pictures, I'm a tad disappointed.  I thought the images from my SD1100 were great (images were sharp, well exposed, and had good color).  For the most part, the pictures from my 300 HS looked good.  They're very sharp and bright.  On the negative side, many of the pictures had very oversatured colors.  In particular, green grass and pink skirts looked unnaturally bright.  Fortunately, I could tone them down a little with picture editing software.  I'm assuming the switch from a CCD to a CMOS sensor is partly to blame.My other minor nitpick with the camera is the tendency of the LCD to scratch easily.  This was a problem on our SD1100 too.  I'd recommend a scratch protection film.Otherwise, I'm quite happy.

The buttons feel great to press and the pictures are as snappy as ever. However, with that said, there are a few concerning flaws of this camera that anyone considering purchasing it should know.First of all, it should be noted that the dual microphones are on top of the camera instead of the front. What this means is that when filming the camera will catch the camera holder's voice more than anyone else's. This is great for people who are trying to narrate a story, but not so great when you're trying to film others. It will be very difficult to catch the voices of those who speak in soft voices unless they're right next to you. All the other HS models as well as the s95 have the microphones in the front and so it's very peculiar that Canon decided to choose to put them on top for this particular model...Second, the lens is definitely too close to the flash. I would've been fine if this camera was just a little bit wider to accommodate the new wider lens. How the design team missed this is beyond me. If you're ever in a dark room using flash you'll notice a black spot in the bottom right corner which is very noticeable. You can correct this by zooming in a little bit which will bring the lens in, but this should've been considered from the start. While you may not need flash as much with the new HS system, it stops this camera from being the best that it can be.Last, but not least, it definitely should be noted that Canon took out the quick erase button and instead stored it inside the function menu which can be a little annoying at times when trying to delete multiple pictures.I'll probably still keep this camera since there isn't a better one with this form and size... but if the 500 hs didn't have the touch screen and was in more supply, I would have probably gone with that one.UPDATE: My previous review was on the Black version. However, I've also had the chance to try out the the silver version, and I have to say that the design looks decently sharp, but it doesn't really differentiate itself from the other versions of the canon powershots as it doesn't come with the same rough texture the black one does. It's actually a fairly glossy coating and I'm much more scared of scratching or smudging this casing than I was with the black one. However, this means I'm also not as scared of scratching other things with my camera. I guess it depends on what things you value more. Also, this could just be a manufacturing difference, but the battery housing seems a little more fragile to me.I didn't really notice this with the black version, but on the silver one some photos of our group indoors on \"auto\" came out slightly plastic looking. I'll keep everyone updated if it continues in the future.UPDATE 2: When zooming out on the silver 300 hs, I noticed a crackling noise when using video mode (480p). I'm not sure if this is normal or not, but it'd be nice to have to the option to change to digital zoom.", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nothing amazing here... just ok image quality", "Author": "Sergei Bobyr", "ReviewID": "RL6HXR5PLAC1O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Either people have lower expectations in terms of image quality or I got a lemon. I'm comparing mine to Canon S410 that I also own.Issues with this camera:1. Camera keeps switching 'scenes' in Auto mode and it's often choosing incorrectly:  a) It tries to do tracking when no tracking is required  b) It often fails to detect macro mode2. Focusing algorithm in Auto mode often refuses to choose a subject that I'm actually interested in. Example: it would often ignore people in the foreground and focus on some background instead.=> 1 and 2 make Auto mode unusable for me...3. Focus is soft most of the time (S410 didn't have this problem). Focus is especially soft in image corners. Changing \"Sharpness\" in Custom Colors in Program mode does help a bit.4. In macro mode it's often impossible to make it focus on the feature you want even using Program mode with center focusing with small frame size (S410 didn't have this problem). It would either not focus at all or claim it focused producing an image that is visibly out of focus. I had many flowers that 300 HS would refuse to focus on while S410 focused just fine.5. Noticeable chromatic aberrations in high contrast photos: anything bright will have an aura around it.6. Noticeable barrel distortion at widest angle: don't photograph people unless they are in the center of the shot.7. It tends to overexpose outdoor pictures.8. It likes to set aperture to f/8.0 (and sometimes above) instead of staying at f/2.7. This adds to image softness.What I do like:1. It's small and light.2. It shoots surprisingly good movies.3. It performs reasonably well under low light conditions (CMOS sensor vs. CCD in S410).I use mine in Program mode only, center focus, with sharpness tuned all the way up.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon 300 HS - A Good, but not Great, P&S;", "Author": "Artemaria", "ReviewID": "R31TRW1PHII9IG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good, but not great P&S.;  If you have realistic expectations, you'll probably be happy with it.  If you think you are getting a DSLR type photo quality in this package, you should think again.We bought this camera when we had lost our Canon SD 800 IS, which, at the time it came out was one of Canon's top of the line cameras.  Because we had a graduation, I went to a store with a reasonable return policy (in case we found the SD 800, which we did later).  I ended up taking about 200 pictures with this camera.  Here are some thoughts:Size - this camera is incredible small.  About the size of a Blackberry phone.  Easily pocketable.Zoom - one of the most useful zoom ranges in any pocket camera 24-120 is a sweet sweet zoom spot.Grip - we had the black with the textured feel.  I liked it, but my wife didn't much care for it.  Try before you buy.Photo quality - while the pictures were generally pretty good, I thought that this camera would blow away the 7 MP SD 800s photos, but for the most part, it did not.The amazing thing about this camera is that on Auto mode, which is how most people would use it, there were a couple of outside shots that were unbelievably amazing and remained sharp no matter how much I blew them up.  There were about 2 such pictures out of 100.  The lens needs alot of light to be at its best, and I really could not duplicate the sharpness on Auto no matter what I did.  I guess sometimes the camera's IQ is good, and sometimes, it isn't as good.Indoor shots are okay, but there was marginal, if any improvement from SD 800 indoor pictures and that camera came out about 6 years ago, that's two sensor generations and one lens generation (although I think the quality of Canon's glass was better then and the sensors are better now).  As I mentioned above, we actually found the SD 800 after the graduation and I took a couple of test shots to make a comparison (because I was thinking of keeping the 300 HS).  Generally speaking, there was not that big a difference in the pictures to bother with the upgrade.Thus, for a P&S; it is a good camera, but will not blow you away with the results.  However, if you are buying it just to print out 4x6, which is what we do with our SD 800, you likely will be satisfied, but if you are thinking of upgrading from a prior generation Canon P&S; the difference in photo quality may not be enough to make the switch worthwhile.Best of luck in your purchasing decision!", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Canon shame on you - disappointed 300HS owner", "Author": "SB", "ReviewID": "RW1PZYE8P6N51", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "To start with, I am Canadian from Quebec and I didn't buy this camera on Amazon.com site. I appreciate Amazon's principles to let people express their opinion about products and I always use this site as a reference before buying anything - thank you Amazon for this.I bought camera online based on positive reviews (note: I had several Canon ELPHs in the past and Canon DSLR, I like photography and I understand it). I still use Canon SD880 and SD1100, older ELPHs with CCD sensor. This camera is exactly what I wanted, small, wide 24mm angle, 5x optical zoom and HD movie. Camera size is very important to me and my DSLR is always home..When I received camera I really liked it, kudos to Canon engineering team! This is beautiful P&S; camera with nice spec.I was disappointed with a first picture taken in Auto mode and I immediately spotted that camera was selecting very high ISO (note, this cam is having small CMOS sensor so high ISO means digital noise, soft/blurry images - possible to print 4x6 pictures but that's it and I guess majority of people are doing exactly this). I am not 'pixel peeper' but images are not sharp at all. High ISO for this camera is 640 and above (400 is acceptable), and this cam goes easily to ISO 1000 and over which is horrible  (still possible to make small 4x6 print but images are soft, full of noise, missing detail etc --> very bad).I selected Program mode and lowered ISO to min which is 100. Pictures were dark even I had enough light and using flash didn't help. Increasing ISO to 400 in P mode resolved issue but it also introduced additional 'softness' into image - which is normal for such small sensor. I didn't investigate further but it make me think that Canon is using some ND filter which is causing darker images in lower ISO (because of CMOS sensor?). This was still much better since in Auto mode camera was selecting ISO 800 and 1600 (just because of the high contrast situation - this was indoor with daylight).My all older ELPHs (with CCD sensor) are limiting ISO to 250 max in Auto mode which assured clean images (these are cameras with small CCD sensor, with their limitations so lower ISO is recommended and I could trust Auto mode).Another issue with 300HS is that camera is using high F (aperture) when zooming in (it's normal but not to this extent). Again, I never saw this on any of my older Canons... I would suggest to disable iContrast from menu, it will not eliminate problem but it will help a bit.Even some professional reviews are mentioning these issues.For example read: [...]---------------Auto flash produced dark results with our Indoor Portrait scene when set to ISO 100, and the camera selected 1/60 second shutter speed. However, switching over to the Slow-Sync mode results in a much brighter exposure, though shutter speed is a very slow 1/4 second. You'll definitely need a tripod at this setting to prevent blurring from camera movement. Shot taken at ~5 feet (~1.5m) on a stable tripod.---------------------Note that he is stating that that he could NOT take a clean ISO 100 image without using TRIPOD and Slow-Sync flash mode in this shot, which is indoor. It's same situation I experienced with daylight-indoor shot.He could do it with almost any other camera, in same situation, and since this is P&S;, who will use tripod in real life? We buy these cameras not to use tripod and to rely on Auto mode or moment is gone.In his conclusion he also mentioned that images are soft,not sharp, but he recommended camera. By comparing pictures on the same site you can judge it by yourself and note that camera will ALWAYS use high ISO in Auto mode except in bright daylight outside.My initial thought was that I received 'dude' (something was wrong with a camera - and it was made in China). I went to closest Best Buy and Future Shop store and guess what, all other 300 HS and 100 HS were behaving same way, made in Japan or China, so nothing is wrong with a camera.Conclusion:This camera is having totally different, unwanted/bad, behavior from all older ELPHs I used which is affecting image quality. In Auto mode pictures are BAD majority of time as explained above.This can be done on purpose by Canon to make a difference between higher P&S; model as S100. In my opinion Firmware is culprit. In any case, shame on you Canon for ruining such a nice device.We deserve better and these issues can be fixed in Firmware (which Canon will never do and I assume that's why camera went on sale for a half price).People owning this camera should email Canon and complain about it !I do NOT recommend this model because of poor image quality in Auto mode (which majority of people will use).If you don't believe me test it, I can guaranty you that cam will select high ISO even with wide open lens (f2.7). Check image - see that noise, softness and blown highlights if you had any bright spot?There are several 300HS owners that experienced same issues I described so read reviews with one and two stars.For me, this is so far nicest ELPH (looking into camera spec) and at the same time it produces worst images due to the bad firmware (lens could be better but I am happy with it).", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Dissappointed", "Author": "AZ Desert Rat \"movie buff\"", "ReviewID": "R10BODZ51W83XH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have a Canon SD1100is and was very pleased with the picture quality.

The quality of this camera has not been surpassed in the P&S; field nor has features. I rarely if ever take photos with this camera but the photo quality is on par with similar 12MP P&S; cameras.Pros:- Stereo mics are located ON TOP of the camera. This records voice evenly when filmed in front or behind the camera. Most other cameras put the mics on front, which means switching from narrating a scene from behind and vlogging to the camera from the front have vastly different audio levels including ambient noise.- Compact size and smooth corners makes this camera fit comfortably in a men's pocket, and not take up too much space in a woman's purse.- Physical video recording button makes it easy to quickly and easily start and stop filming, especially when pointing the camera at yourself. New cameras all come with touch screens with virtual recording buttons which are clumsy and easy to miss or accidentally press.- 24mm wide angle captures a large scene and is 5x optical zoom is great for capturing near and far. The newer model (330HS) has a 12x zoom however video will become very unstable and suffer lots of shake past 5x if handheld.Cons:- The Amazon description INCORRECTLY states this product can film 1920x1080 @ 30fps. It can only film at 24fps @ 1080p. At 720p it will do 30fps.- The autofocus system is fairly quick and accurate in normal lighting conditions EXCEPT when filming. If you hit record before it focuses, it takes FOREVER to correct the focus (it eventually gets it) compared to the very fast focus it will perform when not recording.- It can take a beating however after pro-longed use the lens covers may jam and no longer close when the lens retracts.- I've experienced issues with the audio cutting out on the mics intermittently (right channel drops out momentarily) but it's hard to reproduce.- Low light performance is acceptable but not amazing. Maybe I'm just spoiled by my hdSLR...Overall this is THE BEST camera currently in existence for easy portable video.

After previously owning the Canon PowerShot SD750 and using it consistently for 4 years, I decided to upgrade to another Canon and I have not been disappointed. The 5X optical zoom is great, and the wide angle lens has been a huge help for shooting from a closer distance and still being able to capture the scene that I want. The start-up time is very quick, which is great for capturing those spur-of-the-moment candid shots/videos you always wished you could catch.I debated between the 300 HS and the 500 HS for a while but ended up choosing the 300 for a few reasons. In terms of actual hardware differences related to camera function (as opposed to just the interface), the only advantage of the 500 HS is that it has a larger aperture, meaning it can capture more light. Besides that, the differences are that the 500 HS has a larger, higher-resolution screen and uses touch-screen technology, which lessens the number of physical buttons needed. However, I figured that the larger screen might drain the battery more quickly, and I actually prefer physical buttons since in my opinion, they are more reliable than a touch screen. In addition, the 300 HS is smaller, lighter, thinner, cheaper, and has a faster shutter speed.Perhaps the only minor complaint I would comment on is that the camera might be a little too small for my hands. However, I would say that my hands are larger than average so I would imagine that most people would not find this to be an issue.

I do not write reviews, EVER, so this is a very compelling product that you should buy because it brought me to write one :).I bought this camera two days ago, and got to \"break it in\" that very night when I got it. My sister in law had her baby, and boy did it ever perform. I was taking pictures in a very low lit room. It was medium sized with only one lamp on. (REMEMBER, you are not supposed to use flash with newborns, so I did not, and this served as a real world test for this camera. I feel that the only way to see how powerful a camera really is, is to see what it can do without a flash) I was scared to look at the pictures when i got home, because, after all this is one of the worlds smallest cameras, and a point and shoot at that. I plugged in my memory card into my computer and what I saw still shocks me. The pictures taken in a dark room,without a flash, were clear, and were even brighter than the real life room itself, and no noticable noise showed. Beings I used no flash, this is stunning. There was minimal to NO noise at all in the pictures! This camera is treading on the grounds of both of my sisters DSLRs and taking it by storm.I saw one revewer saying that the build quality of these were bad. That is the biggest load I have ever heard. This camera is rock solid, and feels quite literally like a very solid block of iron, it seriously feels that rigid. Absolutely no sense of plastic-ness feel here. It even has a rough (that isnt quite the right word, it is textured) but in any case makes you feel like you will never drop it. All in all it just adds to the feel and performance of this device that, if i had the money, would pay double price for.As for the flash, it is very bright. dont let the small flash lens fool you, this sucker packs a punch. I took a pic of a dark room with flash, and it illuminated the whole room in the picture to appear like it had full lighting on. this was not a small room either.It has absolutely stunning 1080, plus you have the ability to zoom in while taking video. That in and of itself is one selling point for this camera. Only select few allow you to do 1080, that is all on top of the zoom while taking video which isnt in 97 percent other point and shoots. lots dont even give you 1080 either. Colors were ABSOLUTELY awesome.Need i mention the CMOS sensor? that is what is allowing me to take the great low light photos. Paired with canon's software, these low light photos are grain free (with very very minor exceptions, only noticable when pictures are blown up HUGE!)As you can see, i could go on, and on, all night about this, but you will never experience it until you get one. Go and buy one. Trust me, you will not be dissapointed. Please disregaurd these people that are badmouthing it! Many people hate canon because they are simply being biased and want a different camera company to be better. Reguardless of what they say, i can tell you that if you can stand still at all, even remotely, for just one second, you can a great photo, even without flash in dark situations. with flash, I could quite literally be dancing around, and get a good pic.

You could also select the Macro and Normal modes even in the Auto mode.  Not anymore with 300HS.Try to take a picture from within the car through a window?  Blurred, thanks Canon.Try to take a picture in the dark with poor lighting?  Blurred, thanks Canon.  So much for the excellent BI CMOS sensor, Canon found a way to make it useless!Try to get into the manual mode, and select the Infinity focus mode, then turn the camera off, then back on?  Guess what?  The picture will again be blurred, since your focus setting gets lost!  Thanks, Canon!Try to have the camera by yourself at all times to always be ready to take a good shot?  Guess what, with the macro mode always being considered in the auto mode, you'll likely miss all the action before it finds a good focus, focus times are very noticeable slower than SD1000 or SD300.  Thanks for letting me down again, Canon.Try to disable the Macro mode from Auto?  No way to do so with 300HS.This is the worst upgrade ever, and I'm very disappointed that I didn't realise it in time.  If Canon continues with such poor innovation, then it remains to be seen why would anyone be buying these broken point-and-shoot cameras when even the iPhone can make much better pictures and in much less time.Below is my original review from 2011-08-18; I bought the camera on 2011-08-03.====Original Rating: 4*Original Title: No more competitive advantage to know the configuration rules!Original Review:For me, this 300HS camera comes as an upgrade from SD1000, which in turn was an upgrade from SD300.  From my prior recollection, I was not all that impressed with SD1000 iteration, but this one seems to be a very nice upgrade.First thing you notice, is that there's no longer any shortcuts to change ISO levels or use the micro mode.  That's because there's no need!  Now micro focus is activated automagically, and ISO can go quite high automatically as well, without any HIGH ISO options as was the case with SD1000.Night vision of the sensor seems very impressive, too; I'm totally sold on this BI CMOS!  The contrast as it appears in the viewfinder is often better than what you see with your own eyes as is, and you don't even have to change any settings from AUTO!  Impressive.  The only thing that appears to still be missing is HDR, I guess. :-)A nice thing in my upgrade path, from SD300 (Dig!c II processor) to SD1000 (Dig!c III) to 300HS (Dig!c 4), is that the battery format remains the same, and all the batteries are still compatible, in cameras of entirely different generations!However, I came across a few annoyances (I'll update this list as I go on):* it is not possible to use digital zoom at all if you change the aspect ratio from the default of 4:3, only optical zoom is available.  This is especially annoying if you like to reduce the size at which the pictures are saved, and use digital zoom to specifically crop only the objects in which you're explicitly interested in.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Point-n-Shoot I've owned", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3C1XQSPUZIQR2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I consider myself a avid photographer and although I mainly work with DSLRS, I've had my fair share of point-n-shoots as well.This is the best point-n-shoot camera I've ever owned.

So, I anticipated going in that this is a great little camera and have not been disappointed since it arrived about a month ago. About a day after receiving the camera, I mounted it to my helmet and took it on a favorite mountain biking trail here in southern California. Here's a short video the camera captured on that ride. The video I took is 720 HD, but this youtube video was bumped way down in resolution for ease of playback. Note, the last two clips of a water crossing are slow-motion, which is just as it was shot by the camera, which also shoots nice slow-motion (but, by design, the slo-mo it shoots is much lower resolution, which you'll notice). Oh, and the music is composed and played by my son! :)[...]I won't get technical, here, because lots of surrounding reviews do that nicely. This camera is loaded with features, many of which I'll likely never use. Things I like most: I can easily tailor it to my needs with a very intuitive onscreen menu, it'll shoot with or without a flash, it takes amazing photos, it's SILENT, so can be used on location for production stills during television shoots, it's SMALL, which makes it very easy to take along on any excursion, and it's easy to use.

The only feature I really wish my A75 had is opticalimage stabilization.  Unfortunately, while this camera has lotsof features the image quality leaves a lot to be desired.  Thepictures look washed-out and lack detail.The main reason for the poor image quality is the small (1/2.7\")image sensor.  This size sensor is used in almost all compactcameras and they simply can't produce good quality images at lowlight levels.Note that although the 12 Megapixel 300HS has 4 times a manypixels as my previous 3 MP camera, the sensor is the same sizeand so each pixels gets 4 times less light.  This makes for morenoisy images.  The camera processes the image to try to hide thenoise but a side-effect is that the picture gets fuzzer.I tried to filter out the luminance noise in a raw image savedusing the CHDK firmware.  The result had less noise but also lostdetail. The result was arguably no better than the camera's JPEGoutput.  My conclusion is that, not surprisingly, the cameraalready does the best possible job at removing image noise.There may be specific situations where you could do a better jobmanually, it would quickly get tedious if you tried to do it forevery photo.You can find many examples of photos taken with this camera usingflickr.com's \"Camera Finder\" feature.  The image noise is clearlyvisible in full-size (3000x4000) images shot at high ISO.  Butmost of these pictures look just fine when reduced to fit thescreen which is why most reviewers are happy with the imagequality.Going to a 1/1.7\" sensor as used in the better compact cameras(S95 or LX5) would help a bit (about 1 f-stop), and so would awider lens (another f-stop for an f2 lens).  But more improvementwould require a larger sensor.  Unfortunately, a larger sensoralso means a larger lens.  Interchangeable-lens cameras areeither too large to fit in a pocket or their lenses leave outimportant features such as zoom and image stabilization.I spent some time trying to get the best image quality. Here'ssome guidelines I found useful:- White Balance: set the white balance manually or use the nifty  custom white balance feature.  The AWB setting often fails;  perhaps it gets confused if it can't find something in the  picture to calibrate itself with.- Saturation & Contrast: set custom color to \"Positive Film\" or  use a custom color setting with increased RGB levels and  contrast - the default modes are under-saturated and have too  little contrast- ISO:  for stationary objects: set a fixed ISO that is as low as  possible while keeping an the shutter speed at 1/8s or faster.  This assumes you can hold the camera steady enough for the  image stabilization to do its job.  The automatic ISO settings  are too aggressive and set needlessly high ISO values.  Once  the ISO climbs above about 400 it's probably worth using the  \"Handheld Night Scene\" which reduces noise significantly by  automatically taking four shots and combining them.  for people and other things that move: set the ISO to Auto.  The camera may choose very high ISOs and produce noisy images  but at least you'll get your picture.Note that the sample photos for the ELPH 300HS on Canon's website use manual white balance and ISO 50 (which is strange sinceISO 100 is the lowest manual setting).There is an alpha version of CHDK available for this camera andperhaps the HDR and raw modes could, with post-processing, beused to compensate somewhat for the limitations of this camera.I had also expected the smaller size of the 300 HS to be anadvantage but, actually, it's too small!  The smaller size makesit harder to handle and operate the controls and yet doesn't makeit any more likely that I'll bring it along with me.The camera does take excellent HD videos and has lots ofinteresting modes if you're into tinkering.

Friedman", "ReviewID": "RBQON8ULPROK4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After reading most of the reviews, I decided that this would be a great gift for my sisters birthday. The price was affordable and there did not seem to be much of a huge difference upgrading to the newer models. In addition, I was looking for a simple point and shoot camera that would take quick shots, to avoid that \"oh please take that damn shot\" moment, as you wait. The specs state 1.5 seconds, which is very respectable... until you use the flash. More on this below.This camera is very compact and easy to store in your pocket. The video is pretty clear and easy to record. The buttons are located in good locations and the color Red was very well received, making it easy to locate.Now for the problems:1) IMAGE BRIGHTNESS ON LCD SCREEN: The major problem, at least with the camera we received, is that the image brightness displayed on the screen does not match to those you will see on your computer. Of course, this is not a surprise, since the lcd on the camera only shows a small amount of pixels but the problem is not the clarity or color, but that of brightness. Photo's taken in low light situations with no flash will look bright enough on the camera's display but once you transfer to your computer, they are very completely dark and extremely grainy. Likewise, photo's taken with a flash look washed out on the screen but once transferred, look not as bright. Decreasing the screen brightness on the camera did nothing to elevate this issue. Defective screen?2) FLASH TOO BRIGHT:The flash is too bright and not controllable in either automatic or manual modes. This results in photo's that look too flash exposed and too many highlights in the face. Luckily, if the ISO setting is low enough, the photo's can be corrected in any photo editing software.3) AUTO ISO TOO HIGH & GRAINY: Although automatic mode is indeed handy for people who do not want to or know how to adjust settings. The flaw here is that the Auto mode decides which ISO setting to use, which in most situations is exceptionally high (i.e ISO 400 with Flash, ISO 1600 without). The higher the ISO the more grainy the images will be and the less pixel brightness information you have for photo retouching or correcting.The fix for this is to use manual mode and change the auto ISO to a value of 100 or 200. Make sure that your flash is set to auto or OFF, and this should result in a much better quality looking image with no pixel grain. When the flash goes off, you might get an overexposed image that is too bright, but since you have a lot of pixel information, you will most likely be able to adjust that in any photo editing software.4) TOO SLOW WITH FLASH: Although photo's taken without a flash are taken at an impressive 1.5 seconds, once you include the flash, that time dramatically increases to 3-4 seconds, where your models have to wait patiently with there frozen smiles that turn to grins.IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED (likely by purchasing another model):1) ISO Max, this way you can guarantee that the camera won't select such a high setting of ISO 1600. ISO 400 should really be the high limit.2) Flash brightness control. This would eliminate the need to correct for this in a photo editor. Auto Flash brightness based on ISO would be ideal.3) Ability to reuse last auto setting for next photo. This way, the camera does not need to recalculate focus, red eye, settings, etc all over again.4) An LCD that displays correct brightness of photo's taken (if my camera is not a defect).NOTE: In my defense, I should have been more aware that taking photo's in low lighting would result in a high AUTO ISO setting of 1600. I actually didn't notice that ISO until the day after. However, when I viewed this through the camera's lcd screen, they looked quite bright (even the darks were bright enough) and overexposed when using a Flash. Being very impressed with the low lighting photo's, I decided to avoid using the flash for more than half the photo's.....

Don't worry about all of the different reviews you read that try and point out flaws in the pictures, the picture quality is excellent (I am displaying on a brand new 27\" MAC) and I really see no issues.  It does have a lot of cool features that are kind of buried in the menu system, but I don't think I have used anything except the auto mode to this point.  Also, I was able to get it on sale on here for $120.

My last camera was a 6 and did the job just fine.  It is several years old and showing some loss of quality, so I wanted to upgrade a little.  I use my camera for general grandma snapshots, simple scenic photos and at work to record visitors for Facebook.  I am really happy with the results.  Work is particularly challenging because the lighting is very bad.  Photos were excellent if I turned off the auto flash.  The size and weight are perfect for me.

Which explains why it tops the charts.An additional consideration:  If grip is important, then the black textured finish may be a better option. However I have also read that the textured finish tends to pick up lint along the way and may be difficult to keep clean, plus tends to get snared in one's pockets (the good out of this is that it doesn't drop out nor gets pick-pocketed as easily).  It is interesting that colour choice could have such large implications. Perhaps the product description should state the textural differences as I'm sure it was intentionally different to provide choice in taste & functionality.I, OTOH buy most things in silver, in this case I was beginning to wonder if I had made the right choice as I had bought it for an elderly person with a little arthritis - she had found it rather slippery and I had subsequently read about the black casing providing better grip.  Well ... at least this clears it up. I would loathe having to try and remove lint from its sandpaperish surface.

I did a lot of research as I always do when considering purchasing anything and this was no exception. After selling my Canon 40d, I wanted a simpler camera that I could take everywhere. I boiled it down between the 300, 310 and 510. I pretty much crossed off the 510 after seeing it had only an f3.4 lens coupled with the potential short battery life with the touch screen and the fact that someone said \"this is not like your iPhone screen\". So it was between the 300 and 310. I bought the black 300 that a major yellow tag big box store had in a package with an battery, case and card for a great price. After getting it home and doing a little follow up research regarding possible issues of these that were made in China, I found that mine was made in China so I went back and bought a red one made in Japan. So far so good. And I love the red over the black. I couldn't get used to the texture on the black one plus after seeing how bad the floor model look of the black one, I could just imagine how bad mine would be after continued use.So after using it for a week and loving it, I had the chance to check out the 310 in person when it arrived in the stores and decide if I should return the 300 or not and get the 310. The screen was bigger on the 310 and of slightly better quality but what made the final decision for me on which camera to keep was the placement and moreover the size of the menu and auto/program buttons on the side. Why they did this I have NO idea. If you have fingers bigger than that of a 5 year old then good luck manipulating the switches; especially the top one (I think it's the auto mode one). That alone sealed the deal. As I mentioned in a comment to one of the reviews on the 310, I would have to carry a paper clip or toothpick with me at all times to flip that switch--and I have narrow fingers. So all in all I am VERY happy with the 300 and love the many features it has. I was too much of a pixel peeper and that's why I bought the 40d but after hardly using it and taking so-so photos because I was not too savvy with it, I just gave up and sold it. I wanted a pocket camera that took good pictures that was easy enough for my wife to use and small enough to take anywhere. I found it in the Canon 300HS.

It is almost like the size of a credit card, and almost as thin as a smartphone. It is very light and very pocketable.Build:I bought the black unit. It has this anti-slip, gritty feel to it. I appreciate this tiny nuance to avoid accidental slippage. The camera body is metal and not plastic. It feels good in your hands and it looks pricy rather than cheap. It looks very stylish and hip too.Features:I'm amazed how Canon was able to squeeze tremendous features into a camera this tiny. It has features available only to more expensive and larger digital cameras.Price:This camera is way *UNDERPRICED* ... but don't tell Canon about it. BTW, I got mine on sale at BB for $20 off retail.Performance:I ordered two 8-gigs SDcard from Amazon which has not arrived yet. So, I used an old Sandisk 2-gigs, class 2 SDcard. I used the Smart AUTO function and took pictures in low light (only the light from my computer monitor in a darkened room). The quality of the pics was very good. I took a few seconds of 1080p video hoping that my Canon won't choke. I was amazed that the Canon took a 1080p video although the quality was a little bit grainy (in very low light). I took several pics underneath flourescent lighting in the gym, and the pics were excellent. Flesh tones were true and not saturated.One of my favorite features so far, is the Movie Digest. If you select this feature, this little Canon will take a few seconds of video before it takes a picture. So at the end of the day, you can stitch together a full-length video show out of the few seconds of video snippets. Simpy amazing !!!!!I'm still exploring the various features of my tiny Canon. I'm like a kid playing with a new toy I just unwrapped under my Christmas tree.

It is small enough to carry around anywhere and not have any excuse not to bring it with you when you go places and it takes good quality pictures that dont look like they were taken with a cheap consumer camera right away if framed properly.  Not only that but the video quality of the camera is as good as if not better then most consumer HD camcorders out there.  Now at first you may think well such camera would be useless for good videos because it being so small there is no way to really keep the video steady. Thanks to optical image stabization the camera stays very steady even handheld.  Its image stabilization is actually superior to my Canon HD camcorder which i paid 3 times as much for.  This is wonderful as it means you can have one device thats small enough to take anywhere that can take good pictures and excellent video and the video is at 24 frames per second which is rare for a consumer small camera that is the same rate as film so you can get a nice cinematic look.The camera has a very nice wide angle lens that really stands out as you can get more stuff in the shot like people and enviroments (is also great for taking pictures of indoor things like rooms in your house or places you visit) compared to my mothers kodak easyshare camera the view that it capture is significantly more.  It also is great for video too as was the problem with my older camcorder i felt i had to back up most times to get things in the shot.I have used a Digital SLR and dedicated HD Camcoder (that used tape) and i must say this is a real joy to have. I had not been using my SLR and Camcorder that much as having an ipad now i just didnt feel like carrying them all around and switching back and forth.  (the Powershot also has better auto white balance then the SLR i used) for a pro you might want a more advanced camera but for the average user this is a wonderful camera to havethe only downside i saw is that sometimes apparently the battery cover may come off, but thankfully you just snap it back into place with no problem. Also battery life is a bit on the low side as if you are out on a trip or out and about for like a day and taking a lot of video and pictures the battery will not last all day , my suggetion would be to to get a spare battery from amazon and then have both so you are set!a 16 gig memory card will net you about 1 hour of HD video or about 6,000 photos (photos are only around 1 meg each ish so dont take up a ton of space which is nice)If this thing was out 6 years ago at the price it is now i would have gotten this instead of paying $2,000 for the camera and camcorder i got.  It really is a great little camera (it also does non-HD slow motion video which is a neat bonus too!)  the video quality is superb and picture quality is very good as well.a great camera expecally for around christmas.  Yeah most cell phones have cameras now days but most cell phone cameras are so so at best this wuold easily in my opinion beat any cell phone camera and the video expecally would beat any cell phone video (or even the iphone/ipad2 video)and this in my opinion also beats the flip video devices you can get. as this camera offers more steady shots (which in my opinion is absolutely essential with HD video the steadier the video the better it is)great product!

Both are great options and besides price, nearly identical so you can't go wrong with either one. My decision to go with the 300HS came down to a few things that might help others choose a camera.- The sony wx9 captures 1080i AVCHD video @60fps which looks great...until I read that that file format is difficult to edit. I planned on making a lot of videos for youtube/facebook and didn't want to hassle with having tons of videos in a difficult file format to edit and share. To test this, I downloaded several AVCHD videos from torrents and sure enough, it took me a while to find a video player that would consistently play it smoothly without crashing. The canon 300HS uses .mov files which are easy to edit with just about any video editing software. This was the biggest deal breaker for me.- Although the canon 300HS's video quality is 24fps and not 60, for my non-professional use, I think it looks fantastic! I have recorded videos @ 1080i, uploaded them to youtube, and watched them through an internet connected TV at a best buy store that has 120hz or 240hz motion plus enabled and the video is EVEN BETTER! Smooth as butter! That made me realize I didn't need 60fps. Go to youtube and search for 'canon 300HS test video' and see for yourself. Then watch the same video on high end TV or monitor. You see? You don't REALLY need the extra FPS and bigger file size for your boring video :)- I was worried that limited maximum video length would be annoying, but honestly, I never record anything longer than 10 minutes. Moreover, stopping recording, and starting to record a new video takes 3 seconds. After buying the camera, missing 3 seconds is not a deal breaker as I once thought it would be.- About the camera and windows XP: My only gripe is that when I have the camera connected to XP, I can't browse the content of the memory card through 'My Computer'. I have to browse through it via the canon software. However, using the canon software is FASTER than through windows XP! If I have a folder with hundreds of pictures and hundreds of .mov files, the canon software FLIES while browsing it and it even shows thumbnails of videos. XP only shows a generic icon. Finding a video and switching between one video and the next is INSTANT in the canon software, but takes AGES thru XP! My PC is no slouch either.- About the canon software: I honestly had zero expectations. I thought it would be slow, bloated, sluggish, featureless, and painful to use, but I was actually impressed! I found it to have everything I needed to handle hundreds of pictures and videos, browse, sort, delete, rename, and have them ready to share with friends without pulling my hair out. In fact, the built-in option to upload straight to youtube was a nice surprise, because that's what I intended to do A LOT and made me glad I made this purchase. Sidenote, there is no option to upload to facebook or twitter with the canon software. I didn't read this in other reviews.- Here's my biggest retrospective point and lesson learned. I obsessed over which camera to buy based on specs and reviews and sample images and recordings. It got to the point where I was scared to buy ANYTHING. In the end, I realized, I just needed a simple point and shoot camera to take pictures of my friends and I hanging out and occasional video that only WE would care about. This camera met and exceeded my expectations. I am 100% satisfied with my purchase and I get compliments about my camera and my pictures all the time and I don't even try. The camera does all the work for me!- Canon sells a waterproof cover for this camera on their website. I have not tried or tested it. Canon does not make these housings for all their models. I did not read this is in other reviews.- I bought a $10 plastic shield for the LCD screen like the types you would put on an iPhone and used a blade to trim to size. Now I'm not afraid to put the camera down on the LCD side on rough surfaces like rocks or wooden picnic tables. I didn't think of this for a while when I first bought it, but glad I did before I incurred any damage to the screen. Did not read this in other reviews either lol.- You can edit your videos straight from the camera! Trim the begging, trim the end, or both, then save the slimmed down video as a NEW file straight to your camera, or overwrite the existing file! This is an AWESOME time saver when you are on the go! It frees up memory too! I use this ALL THE TIME and didn't think about looking for it as an option in a camera. I'm glad its there!- The automatic panoramic picture mode in Sony's camera is impressive and EASY to use. You just shoot and turn the camera and you're done. With the canon camera, you have to go through a confusing and complex set of steps that its faster and less stressful just to take sequential pictures yourself than to try and use the canon's menu system. I honestly couldn't figure out how to take panoramic pictures with this camera. It's very confusing, but I don't care. I never take panoramic pictures.- When I plug in my camera with an HDMI cable to my TV, I can use my TV remote to control the camera menu on my TV! I can browse, edit videos, and more sitting on my couch across the room! Did not read this in other reviews and an AWESOME way to share videos and pictures at your friend's house. I don't know if only certain TVs let you do this, but for what its worth, I have a Samsung LED TV from 2010. Way cool! Wish I figured this out sooner hehe!- Battery life: Kinda sucks if you take a lot of video (because you forget how many times you re-watch it and fail to take that into account). However, lots of my friends have canon cameras and they (not all) have the exact same battery so I often borrow theirs instead of buying a spare. Like asking around for a phone charger in a clutch. Whodathunk? Not me, until I realized tons of ppl have canon cameras. :)- I love the slow-mo capture mode! The quality is crappy but the effect is always fun! My friends always want to play with this! I wasn't expecting to use this as much as I do! Kind of an unexpected ROI!- Cliff notes: Excellent camera for daily use!!

Since I am not a professional photographer and can not currently see dropping > $700 for a good SLR, I was in the market for a camara that would take better quality pictures than what you get with cell phone while not being overly complicated to use and being reasonably priced. This camara has fit that bill very well so far.Picture quality has proven excellent, a definitely step up from what you typically get with a cell phone. The camara does a good job managing lighting in AUTO mode and making simple mode changes has proven reasonably easy. This does bring me to one sticking point: the camara menu takes practice to get used to finding everything quickly. It is not as intuitive as it should be. However, it is still reasonable. The LED screen works fairly well. It can get overwhelmed a bit in heavy, direct sunlight. However, even then, it tends to do a better job than most any other portable electronic device I have owned with an LED screen. It would be nice if it had a seperate view finder for those circumstances. However, no one seems to be doing that in this price range anymore.Canon's image stabilization system in its recent camaras has proven very effective. We have had previous versions of Canon, Olympus, Kodak, Samsung, and Sony point-and-shoot camaras (yes, I have had some relability issues with some of these in the past, especially Olympus, Samsung, and Sony - not with this camara so far!), but this one provides us with consistently better, clearer shots. The camara works very well (for the price range) in low light, much better than any previous point-and-shoot I have owned. The camara out performs our smart phone picture quality as well, which is really the whole point of owning a seperate point-and-shoot.Batterly life has proven good for this camara as well; we seem to get between 250 - 400 pictures (many using the flash) before needing to switch battaries. I purchased two third party batteries and routinely swap them out so that battery life is not an issue. The third party batteries do not last quite as long, but still allow us to manage the camara very well.Finally, file transfer to a computer is very easy with the Canon software provided. Can move 1000+ pictures (purchased an 8 MB flash card when I bought the camara) to my PC in about a minute or less through the included USB cable.Bottom Line: great little camara for the price. Definitely step up from using cell phone camaras. Nice filler camara between the cell phone and a good SLR, especially for the price. Could use a better menu layout and a seperate view finder.

For what it's worth, mine is made in China and thus far exhibits no evidence of the zoom motor noise that other reviewers have reported. Recording in a silent room the sound of the motor was nearly imperceptible throughout the optical zoom range.I will update this review as time goes on. For the time being I just wanted to add my own experience to the Made in Japan vs. Made in China debate.Given some of the reliability problems documented by reviewers (e.g., lens errors, LCDs going blank), I do plan on buying a Square Trade 2-year warranty; I consider it a fairly inexpensive insurance policy.June 20, 2012After a week of taking photos and videos I can offer some additional observations:* The camera is very small, which I love. It will fit into any pants pocket and you don't even know it's there. But with its small size comes the likelihood of inadvertently pressing the on/off button, which is not something you want to do when trying to stuff it into a case as I did at Best Buy when looking at a Lowepro Sorrento 10 case. The case was a snug fit and I mistakenly pressed the on button with the camera in the case and got a \"lens error\" which scared the daylights out of me. Bottom line: Small is good, way good, but be careful!* Some pieces of the camera seem cheaply made, like the battery door for instance. It's made from flimsy plastic. As one who appreciates engineering, I think that using plastic for this piece was unavoidable, but some people may be put off by how cheap the door feels and looks. The auto/program auto switch is another example. The switch wobbles a bit; but every camera I looked at in the store had a switch that did the same thing. Bottom line: It's not built like a Leica or a Breitling watch.* Regarding the texture: Calling the finish \"like sandpaper\" is, to me, an exaggeration. To anyone who is familiar with it, it feels smoother than 1000 grit wet/dry sandpaper. I like it myself. It helps make the camera feel good in the hand.* The photo and video quality are great for a point and shoot. In photos taken in my first week, the colors seemed nicely saturated and the white balance seemed largely on target, although most shots were taken outside. To take advantage of the camera's speed during continuous shooting, it seems you do need a class 10 45 mb/s SD card. I've been using a class 6 Transcend SD card and it seems to make the camera lag a bit during continuous shooting. Bottom line: It takes great photos and videos, but consider using a high speed SD card to optimize the camera's features. I plan on buying a new high speed card soon.More thoughts to come. After my first week with the camera, I'm thrilled with it. It takes great pictures, great video, is a pleasure to use and is an example of great industrial design. I'm coming from a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35, which I sold to KEH, that was bothersome to lug around. This Elph 300 HS seems to take photos and videos that are as good if not better and is much, much easier to carry. Granted, it doesn't have the 18X zoom that the Lumix had, but the wide angle on this camera is remarkable and seems as though it will offer me some compositional choices not possible with the Lumix.

The controls and menus just make sense.  I would think even without much photography background you could master these quickly.  Latter reading the manual in detail I was pleasantly surprised to see a lack of overly sophisticated controls on a simple camera.  Just enough flexibility to let you use the camera to its limits.I don't take many flash shots or use the video feature other than to test them out.  Both seemed very good but again that is not my area of expertise.Minor thing of note.  This camera is not small it is tiny.  If you have large fingers the controls can be a little tough to avoid hitting multiple controls at once but no big deal.Additional plus-  my black one has a textured, rough finish.  I love this.  Much easier to grip and none of that hockey puck problem on slick services.In summary- for the $149 I paid this is a great second camera, outdoor camera or even a first camera if you don't have extreme demands.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Auto focus?

You can tweak the settings, force infinity mode - but nonetheless, after my smart Panny the performance is extremely frustrating (keep in mind that they are selling for almost the same price nowadays).  Macro shots - look decent, but the ones coming out of Panny still have more details and are more sharp.I also feel that there is a lack of scene settings: they have added some \"extra\" modes - like miniature effect and fisheye - but i really think it's pure BS - wish they have concentrated on features that are truly usable.After playing with this cam and comparing pictures to my old one, i'm returning this one - dont want to wait until it becomes totally unusable.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Compact, Clear pictures, nice video, good manual functions", "Author": "Sgrigs", "ReviewID": "R1QFWCEYNF6JEF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera so i could have something to carry in my pocket on hikes and skateboarding and just whenever.  The quality of the picture is really good for a compact camera and the HD video is very clear.

I also like the grippy texture on the outside, it makes it easier to handle.  I haven't owned it for long so I can't say anything about the durability but definitely a nice camera. I initially had issues with the video not saving right, so make sure you have an SD card class 6 or higher for the HD video and that you format the card (settings then format on camera).  The only downfall is the very wild angle lens.  I like the wide andle for some shots but sometimes it makes close up images a little weird (people have big heads and little feet)  This is not usually a problem and can provide cool effects and widen the shot which is good for indoors.

MY mom owns a Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III and between her and i using it, we have filled up almost 50gigs of just pictures on my computer. The only problem is it is big and heavy, and we need a backpack just to carry it and its lenses around. That's exactly why i wanted just a simple point and shoot that i could take anywhere with me, so i went ahead and bought this camera, and here's what it's about.This camera does EXACTLY what i want it to do and what it should do. I didn't buy this camera for the purpose of the best shots possible, at a relatively low cost, and in a small camera that I can take anywhere with me. For the purpose of my review, I'll be relating the quality of this camera to what you payed for it, not to the Quality of the EOS-1Ds Mark III. That being said, i couldn't ask for more out of this. This camera has plenty of features, takes great pictures, especially at low light, takes good quality video, and is really fun to mess around with the high speed video mode. Although the high speed may not be the best quality, and requires a good amount of light, it is fun and interesting to use. Anyways, im not going to get into the technical stuff with this camera, but i will say that it has gone beyond my expectations. I didn't really research many cameras before i bought this one, i just went to a camera store and asked them to hook me up with a decent point and shoot, and this is what i got, and man can i say I am so happy that this was the camera that they gave me.To address some issues about this camera that other people had, the black paint is textured... SLIGHTLY. Its not bad and is never irritating to touch. At least for me, i like the feel of the paint. And as for the sound in the high speed video mode, you dont need sound. When was the  last time you saw an extremely slow motion recording with the sound? and if there was sound, there's some really high tech stuff that has to go into that.And for the only con that i can find about this camera... would be battery life?? its not that bad, but iv had other cameras that last longer. And the only other bad thing about this camera is that i just dont find myself taking my EOS-1Ds Mark III anywhere because this camera is so simple, and so great.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little camera for vacation", "Author": "William Cunningham \"Reggie\"", "ReviewID": "R28BRDQQDAKUM8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera so that I wouldn't have to lug my Canon Powershot SX100 around.

I finally decided to get something that was small, inexpensive, and could take really good pictures and video.  The ELPH 300 was highly recommended by a camera buff who I worked with.  Another thing I really liked about the camera is that the battery lasts a long time.  I have only charged it once and have used it several times taking video and pictures.

It takes amazingly vivid and detailed pictures outdoors, low light, and even no light! Test it out in a completely darkened room, and you will be shocked at the resulting image. I purchased the black model, and I have to say that the people who describe the finish as being like sandpaper are exagerating a bit. Most big box stores carry this model now, so you can finger it yourself before you buy it there or here on Amazon. I think it adds a solid grip to this camera and makes it a little more rugged looking and feeling. As of this month,Jan. 2012, The Canon Elph 110HS is now out, with all the features of this Canon Elph 300HS and more, so on paper, The Elph 110 is a better camera, as it has Digic 5 sensors and this one has Digic 4, It is 16.1 Megpxl.s and this has 12.1 and unlike it's predesesor, The Elph 100, can zoom while in 1080p video. Oh, and it's $20 dollars cheaper! Amazon has it, but you will have to directly type it into the search. Bigger LCD screen, as well. I would also point you to Youtube, as there are many video reviews of The Elph 300HS and 310HS posted there. The 310HS is essentially very simmilar to The 300HS, but has a larger LCD, and 8X's zoom and The 300HS only has 5X's zoom but utillizes it well and does pretty good a little beyond optical zoom, but this time there is a $55 dollar increase with The 310HS. As I said, The Powershot Elph110 is a better camera on paper, but it is so new, there are not any reviews on it yet, so I would still stick with The 300 HS or 310 HS or even The SX230... if a little more size isn't an issue, because it has 14X's zoom and that's finaminal. My girlfriend has The SX230HS and it takes SLR quality shots, almost. Each 1x increment in zoom is a huge improvement in flexabillity and quality. More megapixles really dosn't mean much, most times. I hope I haven't overwhelmed you guys, but just stick with The Canon HS models and you won't go wrong! Update: Purchased some cool goodies last week for this camera. They include: The Case Logic TBC-302 case, The Pedco Ultrapod tripod, The Amazon Basic A to C Type HDMI Cable(\"Mini\" to HDMI), and a $5.00 twin pack of spare batteries from Eforcity, and a 16gb Class 10 SD Card.

I'm not a professional photographer, I was just looking for something to replace my older, bulky digital camera, and this thing is a joy to use.  It's slim when not in use, and takes exactly the type of pictures I want.  The video feature is nice, easy to use, though the microphone on it isn't great.  Keep that in mind; if you're planning on taking lots of video, it's heard to hear people if they're speaking in a normal voice when they're more than 4 feet away.  It isn't a problem for me, as that wasn't my primary purpose, but I can see the advantages in having it as a feature.  Might look into whether there is an exterior microphone option if we use it more in the future.  Take a look at the sample photos.

I don't expect anything near perfect from a compact camera (that's what my dSLR and arsenal of lenses is for), but this camera takes pretty good pictures and is quite fun to play with. I find the menu to be fairly intuitive (I never even opened the instruction book). I received the red version of the camera, which I wasn't crazy about at first, but guess what I haven't misplaced  yet! It is also very light and compact, which offers a bit of a catch-22: it's easy to carry around anywhere, but I'm constantly afraid I'm going to drop it if I don't have the wrist strap on simply because there's no curve or girth to hold on to.The only two things that drive me somewhat nuts about this camera:1) The flash is located right above the lens, which creates a shadow in almost any picture you take up-close while using the flash. Also, as a lefty I normally have my left index finger on top of the camera to steady it; however, the flash is so close to the top of the camera that my finger sometimes cuts off part of the flash - and I have tiny fingers!2) There's no view-finder (although I've found this to be a problem with most recently made compacts). Personally, I don't always like holding my camera more than a foot away from my face and looking at an lcd screen. Sometime's it's nice to put my eye up to a camera to take a picture.

I read through the Nikon manual over 6 times and I still can not get the hang of the camera (I consider my self a Techie and very savvy with mechanical or electronic things.)

Durand", "ReviewID": "R2088O1NEL2T8B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for work so top specs were not a major consideration but it needed to be decent. However after using for a little while and looking at the pictures on screen at 100%, I must say that this is a surprisingly good camera. The camera is very small and portable and the fantastic rough texture of the black paint makes it very easy to hold on to.  The camera is also made out of metal and is very sturdy. There is no noticeable flex or deflection on any surface even if pressed or gripped strongly.  The lens barrel and surround also appear to be metal and look like top quality parts.  Overall I was really surprised at how \"quality\" the camera appeared and felt in terms of construction at this price point. Especially when you compare it to comparable PS cameras in the same price range that are made mostly out of plastic.The menu system is easy to use but it does have the new \"rolling\" menu interface. I prefer the old Canon menu style but this one is easy to get used to after a while. I use the camera mainly on Program and not on Auto. The auto function seems fine but it is constantly \"searching\" for the right setting and updating its choices on screen. I found it to be \"busy\" and slow down the camera.  I will only use it on Program mode.  It has a lot of the usual Canon camera settings including the popular \"miniature setting\".  Picture quality, considering the size of the sensor, is also surprisingly good. I compared pictures from this camera to the same pictures taken by a Panasonic LX5, which has a larger sensor and brighter lens, and unless you are pixel peeping and looking at things very critically, the pictures taken by this Canon can hold their own.  Sure the Canon has to go to higher ISO settings due to its slower lens (not F2.0) and the pictures are not as tack sharp and color saturated as the Panasonic but noise is extremely well controlled for a camera in this price range. Color noise was particularly well controlled and, although some may disagree with me, at times better controlled than the LX5. Also color is typical Canon, in its rendering, which in some cases was better than the Panasonic.So if you consider that this camera is now around $150 and less than half the cost of the LX5 (remember the LX5 was originally close to $500 at one point) and a heck of a lot more portable, it is a very good performer and in my opinion one of the best camera values I have seen. Other reviewers have opined that unless you need the manual controls of the Canon S95 that this Elph would be all that one would need.  I do not have the S95 so I can't back that statement up personally but based on what I have seen so far I can see why they would say that.  The flash is small and typical of an ultra compact so I would not expect it to be a top performer but the camera does well without a flash so it's not that big of a problem. I have not used it for video and will probably not often so this is not a consideration for me.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Small and Very Good", "Author": "Travinsky", "ReviewID": "R6KCD2ET1827R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazon had a sale and I could not resist getting this camera.

The biggest down side for me is when you are shooting video the zoom is agonizingly slow so if your subject starts to move after you have zoomed in for a shot its best to just stop filming otherwise you will get a good 10 seconds of background while you try to zoom out and find it again.

Of course a tripod screw is on the underside, so timer shots, night photography at high resolution are possible.The 3MB burst mode is great for photography at parties or for candids as the kids play; you just need the discipline to ditch those pictures that actually aren't any good, and the pictures are a decent resolution.  Optical zoom is also flexible and quick; AF performance is quick and markers on screen show what the camera has focussed on to avoid those out of focus foregrounds discovered later in picasa.The higher resolution modes give great quality and allow close cropping without the images appearing pixcelated at decent size, or decent looking enlargements that aren't embarrassing when you get them back.All in all, a well specced truly compact camera with a quality feel and good ergonomics.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Silver over Black for the ELPH 300 HS", "Author": "paul", "ReviewID": "R1E6R6L3CK7UEE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I, too, have a black Canon Elph 300HS (for 8 months) and now a new silver Elph 300HS.

The ELPH 310 HS came out and it regressed to a 28mm lens.  No good.  So...Pros:1) It has the super wide angle 24mm lens.  I could care less what the \"1 Billion X\" zoom is on a camera.  You can almost always move closer to a subject.  Indoors, you can rarely move farther away.2) Great video modes.  I don't need 1080P, but I do like 720P and I really love the high speed 240FPS option.  I can take really neat videos when I want them.3) It does have PANORAMA ASSIST.  I looked through spec after spec and ended up seeing a you tube video that showed the panarama stitch assist mode.  It made me happy.4) Decent low light capabilities.Cons:1) I had to return it because it had a defective AF system.  The camera was constantly hunting during AF.  It would go in and out for about 5-10 seconds and then stop usually out of focus.  I thought this might be a \"feature\" (something I'd have to live with), but I stopped by the local big-box store and their camera performed just fine.2) The buttons on the back of the camera were NOT tactile.  You had to actually LOOK at the buttons to see what you were hitting.  Of course, I use the camera indoors and in low light and I was CONSTANTLY fighting with the buttons.\"Features\" (items that may annoy you, but aren't really bad or good):1) Sandpaper finish.  Yeah, it's very rough.  It makes the camera easy to grip, but it just doesnt' feel right to me.  I would prefer a matte finsh and a wrist strap.2) Microphone location is on the TOP of the camera which makes it easy to cover with your left hand.  If you shoot one handed or on a tripod, I guess it would be okay.3) Wind noise was HORRENDOUS outside.  This is common in these tiny cameras, but you would think somebody would have figured out a better way.This camera (not the broken one I got but a functional one) would be GREAT for indoor blogging, family pictures, etc.  I can't use it for what I bought it for, though.

The Sony has a few features that I like like the ability to use SDXC cards now (not just Memory Schtick), in-camera panorama stitch, Hand-Held Twilight, and good low-light functionality.  For that, I trade the high-speed mode and better (IMHO) optics of the Canon, and about $50.

You will probably never fill it up, however, once you start using the video capabilities you will probably start taking more videos that you have before.

There was just no room in the one already overstuffed carry-on I decided was the only thing I would be taking...  Just about the time I was doing the TSA security thing before boarding here in the States, I realized that, in my haste to get to the airport, I had left my trusty PowerShot SD550 at home.  What followed was a 10 hour flight trying to figure out what I was going to do for a camera once I landed, since I knew I would need one...While frantically searching through one of the gargantuan electronic mega-malls in downtown Tokyo for ANYTHING, I came upon the IXY 410F, which is the branding used in Japan for the PowerShot 300HS.  I bought it mainly because, A). I happen to like Canon products and B). It hit my price point.  Boy, am I glad I did.  What a great camera!  After stumbling through the user's manual with my awesome grade-school level command of Japanese (and pushing a lot of buttons), I was stunned by the features Canon was able to pack into such a small camera.Now, I'm far from a professional photographer and only have the barest inkling of ISO, shutter speeds and the like.  That said, in side-by-side comparisons of photos taken with the SD550 and the 300HS, the 300HS wins hands down in picture clarity, which you might expect, since the SD550 is 7.1 MP and the 300HS is 12 MP.  Where the 300HS really shines is in taking pictures in low light.  The pictures I was able to capture the first night I got it were stunning...  Videos (using a Transcend 32 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS32GSDHC10E) are smooth, and while the sound quality is nowhere near what I can achieve with the aforementioned VIXIA, the 300HS is a fifth the size and weight.  Not bad for a camera that will fit in a shirt pocket...  The face recognition feature, combined with the AF/IS, make the 300HS super-easy to use when photographing people and 5X optical/20X digital zooms are great for distant shots.  I was also impressed by the clarity of the rear LCD.  Even in bright sunlight, I found I could easily see to frame shots, even with the camera held above my head.The only downsides I've found on the PowerShot 300HS are associated with one of its chief selling features; its small size.  For someone with big hands (like me), the camera often seems to get lost.  While the rear controls are well laid out and the grainy case texture has a nice feel, when I'm in a hurry to get a shot, I sometimes find myself mashing the on/off button instead of the shutter.  This isn't as much of a problem on the SD550, since the shutter button/focus ring is physically raised, so it's easy to find when holding the camera and focusing on your subject.  Also, it just seems to me that the 300HS is just a little more cheaply made than the SD550.  The SD550 has a beefy, solid feel to it, whereas the 300HS is much lighter and physically much smaller.  The battery/SD card door on the SD550 is spring operated and is well made, while the battery/card door on the 300HS is a slider that I always feel is on the verge of busting off when I don't line it up just right.These nit-picky minuses aside, the 300HS is a super point-and-shoot.  While it won't be replacing my XSi for heavy lift photography or my HF 200 for videos, I will be gifting my SD550 to my wife.  When combined with the two Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS Digital Camera Battery - Premium TechFuel\u00ae NB-4L Battery's I bought through Amazon, the Canon ELPH 300HS will be certainly accompanying me on future \"travel light\" trips (if I remember to pack it)!", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just Right", "Author": "Pharia \"Alex\"", "ReviewID": "R12PZNQMLI7UAC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my boyfriend who never had a camera before.

I was really happy with the picture quality and videos, carried the camera in my pocket (in a case) all the time. Suddenly I saw that the shutter cover is not opening any more and I had to use my hand to open/close it for the whole duration of my trip (it was damaged maybe 10 days into my trip, no obvious hit that I felt that could damage the camera). After I returned, Canon estimated the damage to be $170. Needles, to say, I am not having it repaired and I seriously doubt I will continue buying Canon powershot cameras due to poor build quality.

Although the Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS maintains the sleek and compact size of its ancestor, this product has more features to offer to its users.The Thinner, The BetterWith a weight that is below 5 ounces and depth of less than one inch, PowerShot ELPH 300 HS can fit snugly inside your pocket while ensuring you that it has lots of power hidden beneath its sleek point and shoot body. It has an ultra wide angle lens of 24mm that comes with a remarkable optical zoom of 5x that can give you your needed versatility for shooting in whatever situation you might be in. If you ever got zoomed in pretty tight, there is also no need to be worried about things getting extra shaky because it has an optical image stabilizer. Canon believes that style should never be sacrificed for power because PowerShot ELPH 300 HS is perfect for an effortless capturing of great photos, whether you are just taking some walk around town or you have a night-long party.Say Goodbye to Dark PhotosThe HS SYSTEM of Canon has greatly improved shooting even in situations with low light with no need for flash and it can also lower the noise levels for the higher settings of ISO.The HS System being used by Canon will surely take away all the frustration that users might feel during low-lighting shooting as it can deliver you clear and blur-free shoots with every single ambiance still intact so that you will be completely freed from the commonly unwanted effects brought by utilizing the flash. Stunning low light shots have now been made at high and low ISO speeds, with dynamic range expanded in order to preserve the maximum detail in shadow and highlight areas.The Advantage of an HS MegapixelMegapixels have so much more to offer. The HS System incorporated by Canon in Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS can offer a dramatically better sensitivity that the average camera that has a greater or identical megapixel counts. This only means that you no longer require excessive megapixels just to attain the spectacular images that you have been looking for with reduced noise plus you will be getting equally remarkable results with the help of 12.1 megapixel ELPH 300 HS.Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS Features and SpecificationsThinnest digital camera of the world with optical image stabilizer, 5x optical zoom, and 24 mm ultra wide angle lensColor: BlackFull HD video of 1080p for outstanding quality together with a stereo sound, and access made easy by the allotted movie buttonHS System of Canon with DIGIC 4 Image Processor and 12.1 MP CMOS that can greatly improve shooting photos even with no flash in the low light instancesHigh speed shooting at its best with a unique point-and-shoot camera with an AUTO that can intelligently choose the correct camera settings based on its 32 predefined situations for shooting.Lowers the noise levels at the higher settings of ISODynamic IS keeps footage stabilized and optical zoom can be done while shooting a video.Super Slow Motion Movie allows video recording at high speed to offer a playback of slow motion.ProsGiven the features and specifications of Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS, you can already deduce all the advantages that you can get out of using this compact yet powerful camera. It boasts of excellent ergonomics, high quality videos as well as an instant startup.ConsAll devices and electronic products comes with some cons, and in the case of Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS, its flash is a bit inconveniently located, with a rare overexposure and a port cover that is not that properly attached. However, these are very minor disadvantages that can be easily overshadowed by the fact that the flash is not really required in most situations because it can remarkably shoot pictures even in situations with low light.If you are currently looking for a sleek digital camera that is fully-loaded with all the power that you need but will fit perfectly in your pocket, Canon PowerShot ELPH 300 HS is certainly your best choice.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "I got this baby to replace my SD750.", "Author": "lizzy2pink", "ReviewID": "R12AXQY3RIHU6Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Honestly, I have no complaints, works fast, flash is great, low light pictures are amazing.

I found myself fumbling around on the camera because I would accidentally touch the screen and change things I didn't want to change.I am not saying it was not a good camera, it just was not as user friendly for me personally as compared to the 300hs.I did purchase a 3yr warranty that includes Mechanical and Electrical and Drop and Spill coverage as well.This camera seems to have some really mixed reviews.I purchased this camera because the camera I had before (Kodak) worked one day and was dead the next.I only had it for 2yrs. I wanted a camera that was a little more than what the Kodak had to offer and I feel I made a good choice.I also have a larger Olympus camera, but I wanted a little point and shoot camera for trips on the motorcycle and for taking pics of items to sell.I would have never thought that a camera this little would be capable of taking such great photos and video!!I purchased the red elph and it is a great color with a nice satin finish. The 510hs had a high shine and showed fingerprints.If you are trying to make a decision between the 300hs and the 310hs, from what I can tell, between reviews and videos on youtube and other internet sources, the 300hs has a wider view angle and the 310hs has a longer view angle. So, if you like to take pictures at a distance, you may want to purchase the 310hs. Although, the 300hs has a 5x optical zoom and that is plenty of zoom for my needs.

There were some times it was slow on the second shot and i found the display a little small for my middle aged eyes to tell if i was in focus, but most of the shots i took (on auto) were in focus and quite adequate for what i wanted, which was to preserve the memories of my trip.

I'd say it is just a little bigger than a credit card. It is very light weight. The body has a sand paper like texture to it which makes it easier to grip. The view screen is very nice. I like the different ways you can customize your settings. It's pretty standard. It has tons of effects, if you like that sort of thing, like fisheye, toy cam, color swap, color accent, b&w;, etc. As well as, various modes of shooting in different conditions. To access the effects takes a second. It takes great pictures! Really really great pictures! I have been playing around with it since I got it and I am pleasantly surprised every time.

I tried a few Sony point and shoots, and didn't like their pictures; specifically, their night and low light pictures. Interestingly, some of them--like the waterproof TX100--had CMOS sensors, but their quality was not in par with this Canon. For a point and shoot, this camera delivers high quality pictures in day light and very good pictures in dim lighting. It also gives you a good video with anti-shake and image stabilization in a small sized form factor.When I first touched the camera in the store, I didn't like the grainy finish. It was really dirty, and I thought it catches dust easily. However, I was surprised at how clean the brand new one looked when I got mine. After one year of use, it is still as clean as the day one. Its grainy metal finish has several advantages. For one, it doesn't get scratches too easily, and it doesn't slip from your hands. Just remember, the black version come in grainy finish, but the red and silver ones are smooth.If you are just buying this camera, remember that Canon has released a new version called 320HS with same 24-120mm focal length lens. It is 1.5 times more in price, but it has built in Wi-Fi, bigger LCD screen, higher resolution, and many predefined automatic shooting modes. You can find it here: Canon PowerShot ELPH 320 HS 16.1 MP Wi-Fi Enabled CMOS Digital Camera with 5x Zoom 24mm Wide-Angle Lens with 1080p Full HD Video and 3.2-Inch Touch Panel LCD (Black).I am very satisfied with my purchase and Canon point and shoot camera line in general.

I took more videos than photos on this one and the video quality was great when viewed on a HDTV. It was obviously not good when zoomed or under low light. I liked the photo quality as well, especially when taken in low light. Once, we couldn't use the flash as it was misty and the flash was reflecting on the water droplets.

My old camera is a Kodak EasyShare C513 5MP Zoom Digital Camera - Silver (mine is pink). It was good for what it was, but I decided it was time to upgrade to something better. I went camera shopping 2 weeks ago. I was looking for something that was really small, but took great pictures and could zoom while recording videos with sound. This is it. I wandered into Radioshack and they were having a sale. After viewing this camera and the Nikon COOLPIX S4100 14 MP Digital Camera with 5x NIKKOR Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and 3-Inch Touch-Panel LCD (Plum), I bought the Nikon because it was $80 less.That was a mistake! The Nikon feels cheap out of the box and the touch screen is not responsive. It is supposed to be a 14MP camera, but I don't think the pictures looked that much better than the Kodak. I didn't check reviews online before because I was never going to be able to pick a camera without touching it first. I saw that the Nikon only got 3 stars on this site. The reviews are terrible. Once I saw that CNET did not even bother to review it, I drove back to Radioshack and exchanged the Nikon for the Canon.In the two weeks I have had it, I have taken photos and videos at a national park and a state park. Fantastic! The camera has a million settings, but so far I have only used the Auto setting. It adjusts for the light, has great facial recognition, and takes so fast. When shooting videos of birds, I can actually catch them before they fly away. When following a tour guide, I don't have to miss portions of their story because I am waiting for my camera to take a picture. If you need a great point and shoot, this is it.

Of course, it has been very slow for birds--no pictures of small, fast-moving birds.  The main problem with it has been the bulk and size.I bought this little Canon Powershot Elf 300 HS to have a camera that I could always have with me. It has been a delight to use and enjoy.  I can always have it in my jeans pocket.  I put it in a little pouch to give it extra protection inside my pocket.  During Christmas week, my wife and I went to dinner with a couple who are friends.  I took a picture of the couple at the table and then the waiter took a picture of all four of us.  The camera is so simple, automatic and easy to use, it required no instructions to the waiter about how to use the camera.  My picture and his picture were both excellent.  The Christmas lights shinning through the glass behind the table was beautiful background.  The little flash did a great job of giving even lighting to each person.  The skin tones and colors were beautiful.The macro shots of wildflowers are excellent with very appealing colors.  And macros are extremely easy to take.I have been using the little camera to take digiscope pictures of birds.  I take the pictures through a Nikon Fieldscope 82MM.  I zoom the little camera to nearly full zoom and place the camera lens in line with the eyepiece of the scope.  It is easy and takes great pictures.  The image is a little soft compared to an expensive DSLR with long telephoto lens.  But, the softness gives the picture a romantic look.I took digiscope pictures this week of Great Blue Herons and Snowy white Egrets.  Both of these birds are photogenic--the pictures captured their beauty and elegance.I try to remember to put my little camera in my pocket each time I leave the house.

Also the extra wide angle lens makes movies feel more like one of the bigger expensive cameras out there. Image stabilization makes it more user friendly than a t2i. Here is an example of what a 1080p movie can look like -[...]There are some gripes though. The lens protector seems a little flimsy. I dented mine inward and it would not close properly until I 'undented' it back. Night shots can be tricky. I would also prefer the old way of deleting pictures on the old Elphs.

I haven't taken a lot of pictures, but I'm happy with the results....the pictures are sharp and skin tones are good.  The low-light capability is so good, I turn off the flash most of the time.  My photos have little noise at higher ISO settings.  As a side note, I read a review of the Canon ELPH 100  on dcresource (DCPR) site.  He said Continuous Mode activates the OIS system as soon as you halfway press the shutter release, which helps to compose the photos w/o camera shake.  The \"shoot only\" option doesn't turn it on until the photo is actually taken, which improves the performance of the OIS sytem.

Baker", "ReviewID": "R30Y9JYS7OR93E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was kind of an impusle buy for me to replace my Canon Elph S110.  It has served me well for almost a decade, but the 2MP was limiting, and the batteries wore out and the aftermarket ones were only OK, and it had a max memory of 2GB as it used FAT.  It worked for 10 years (and still does), so I was sold on another Canon.Back in 2001, I had thought the S110 was impossibly small, but this is half the thickness.  There aren't many comments on the red model, but I think it's very sharp-looking and definitely not feminine.  I saw the black at Best Buy, and I don't think it felt all that nice...seems there's a reason the silver and red cost more; they put more money into the finish it seems.The pictures this takes are very nice, resolution is up to 4000*3000, or 12MP.  I thought my ancient S110 took good pics, but this is great.  Also, when I had bought this I thought the video would be a gimmick...but it does a GREAT job at that, too.I gave the menu a 3, because...I dunno.  It's not really easy to navigate and not too hard, but it's also a digital camera.  It is better than my S110, though.  It uses SD cards, but I chose to instead use MicroSD-in-the-adapter as it can be used in far more devices...SD-only devices are quite rare now. And to think SD was impossibly small 10 years ago!As for the camera, the screen is huge, and very nice.  I would advise putting a protective film on it, though...I had spare PDA screen protectors and I cut one to fit.  The camera is made of metal, just like my S110.  I'm not sure on the battery life, but it's probably sufficient.  I got a spare for use on day trips where I would take lots of pictures.  I find it amazing that the camera could be half the thickness of the (state of the art in 2001) S110, but the screen is 4 times larger, and the lens is also much larger.  The camera is Japanese-made, which is probably a good thing, considering most everything is made in China now.  US-made would be nice, but this is a Japanese company.I have not explored what the camera can do with manual settings, but the Auto settings work very well.  I'm not a photography-buff, and wanted something that would work well, and this delivered!", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Extremely happy", "Author": "R. Harry", "ReviewID": "R2V7VG77VOXUS6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got this as a replacement for an old sony cybershot.  I do a ton of research before I purchase and this was the best thing I could find in the price range.  The closest thing to it is the *panasonic* DMC-FH27 but I decided on this after looking at the interfaces and menus at the store.  The canon simply is much more straight forward and I was willing to sacrifice some zoom power and megapixels for something that didn't require hours with a manual and training session for my spouse.  Additionally, people have posted some youtube samples of the kind of video this takes and it is far superior to anything in its price range. This is important for me because we can't afford to go out and buy a specialized video camera and this will do a great job.Menu layout is intuitive.  The scene modes are AWESOME.  Very well done and despite being an amatuer I feel like this thing actually improves the quality of pictures I take. I have three picky critiques:1.  If you are going through the preview function to look at old pictures there is a quirky thing about getting back to taking pictures.  If you haven't done it long enough so that the lens retracts, you can hit the preview button again and it goes back to camera mode.  If you do it so long that the lens retracts, if you hit the preview button, the camera turns off.  This was very confusing for the first day and half of ownership.  It took a while to figure out exactly why hitting the same button would not do the same thing all the time.  So, if the lens retracts, you have to hit the capture button toget back to camera mode.  This was the only part about the interface that I thought was extremely dumb and not user friendly.2.  I was disappointed that some scenes and features in the manual set up could not be combines.  For example, you cannot do sepia and the miniatures scene simultaneously.  There are some sub functions as well that are not as intuitive as I would like.  For example, in the color highlight scene (takes black and white pic with one color retained), I have no idea how to choose which color I would like to keep and I'm not sure if I even can.  I tried this scene the other day and it chose what it felt was appropriate but it was not what I wanted.  I have yet to check the manual on that but it would be nice if it were self explanatory.3.  Battery life is a little short but recharge is only about 2 hrs. which is a third of the time it took on my last camera.  It looks like this camera would accept a power cord but it would require an adapter to put into the battery slot.4.  HD video is limited to 10 minute segments.  I know I have seen it said some places that this is to prevent the CMOS sensor from overheating.  But riddle me this Batman, if that is the case why does the camera allow me to immediately start another 10 minute HD video right after I have recorded for 10 minutes.  Would this not also overheat the CMOS sensor?  If the answer to that is yes, then canon failed to put an additional safety feature requiring you to wait for the sensor to cool down before recording in HD again.  Either way you slice it, there is an error in their design.Overall, however, this is a great and versitile camera and amatuer photographers will have little to no complaints.

I was sold by the ELPH / Digic 4 Processor on my SD770IS and after having this newer model for a little while now it has only improved.PROS:-Size: Being the thinnest point-and-shoot camera with a wide-angle lens I've ever seen this camera easily fits into a pocket (I prefer cargo shorts) and is easily forgotten that it is there.-Image Quality: While only being a 12.1MP camera the image quality is still far superior to some of the 14MP P&S; cameras on the market (including from Canon).  I routinely compare pictures from this and my Canon EOS Rebel T1i 15.1 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-Inch LCD and EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens and depending on what the picture is there can be minimal differences (That being said, I still highly recommend using a Digital SLR for nicer pictures).-Zoom: 5x = AMAZING....nothing more needs said.  Less reliant on digital zoom which makes much better images.-Scenes: While I do not typically use any specific scene, the full auto feature does a great job of selecting the approriate image settings (aperture, shutter speed, even ISO) to give you a great picture.  This is even true in lower light situations which, in my experience, most P&S; cameras usually \"crash.\"-Manual Settings: Pretty standard on most P&S; cameras today but the manual settings available on this model are excellent.  For those that do not want to utilize a scene mode for every picture (as I mentioned above) you can manually set everything you would need to take a potentially nicer photograph.NEUTRAL:-Video: I'm one of the \"old-school\" people who say that if you want to shoot video, get a video camera....but that being said this camera does a very nice job of shooting HD footage in a pinch.  The reason I remained neutral on this is that the advertised 1080p video quality is limited to 20 fps but the 720p does just fine at 30fps.-Battery Life: With all of the features this camera has it can definitely go through a battery in a few hours.  However, Canon has nicely mitigated this problem by providing a rechargeable Li-Ion battery to save you cash.CONS:-Menu: I debated not even mentioning this but it seems as though Canon has made some changes to the menu interface on this camera.  I would prefer the menu's from my other camera better but the new setup is easy to learn and very usable.  I only listed it as a CON because if you are already familiar with a Canon interface you may need a little bit of time to get used to the new layout.OVERALL:  I would recommend this camera to anyone on the market who is willing to cough up a few extra bucks to get a \"Tier II\" P&S; camera with plenty of features / perks that can shoot in almost any condition.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic tiny little Camera!!", "Author": "Great Cook", "ReviewID": "R279771TX9KDBL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE IT!!!!!

That auto F-stop always gets it wrong, if you want a side-view of whatever you're shooting, expect it to be blurry.

I find the photos from the 300HS are over-saturated and macro close-ups are very difficult to take. White balance is poor. Focus is different than my SD870IS so there's a bit of a learning curve to this 'new' processor.This is an Automatic Point and Shoot. Turn it on and take a snapshot.The settings menu is not as easy to navigate as previous Powershots and for space-saving they moved the Scenes from a dial to the menu which is a bit more effort to select night scene or pets or fireworks.. etc. There is a single switch to shift between fully AUTO and whatever you've set the scene, via the menu, to be.SUPER SLOW MOTION VIDEO is awesome!~ As are a few of the other scene options. The camera works great for the point and shoot and it's just the right size for my intended purpose. I need to have a camera with me at all times and this fits the bill.A screen protector on the LCD allows me to toss this in a bag or leave it lying in my vehicle console without worry. I'm on the fence about wether I would purchase this exact camera again, leaning toward no since I have grown accustomed to a Panasonic's impeccable focus (since my 870 died) and I definitely prefer the white balance of a Sony I have for Macro work - i.e., taking pics for eBay or product shots.Seems the 300HS is better suited for 'general' photography, like catching the sunset, taking pics of houses for work or catching your friends doing silly things. As with most of these little cameras, there is no telephoto and the 3-5x zoom doesn't do much at all.I vote middle of the road on this.. what was my favorite camera in the world and my 6th Canon Powershot.Update: I should have given this camera another star simply for the fact it can take pictures in incredibly low light without a flash.

I bought this on the 4th of this month, so I've been using it everyday. I love the pictures and videos.

I also bought the 100HS (6th Elph :-)) to replace my wife's SD1100IS.  I generally replace my point-and-shoot cameras (P/S) about every three years.Like many other reviewers have mentioned, Canon does make very good P/S cameras.  I bought these cameras for the HD (720p/30fps and 1080p/24fps) video capabilities.  There are plenty of good reviews on the video capability of this camera so I will not mention it here.I am a \"tech-y,\" and researched beyond just the number of mega-pixels.  Truth be told, MP does not mean anything to me if the image captured isn't sharp or useable.  I am a super fan of the Canon Elph series for their overall quality, image quality, size, weight, battery life and the response time between pressing the button to take a photo to the time the camera's shutter is released.  (This has been the number one factor (for me) in not taking blurry pictures.)  To me, an imaged captured is worth more than not getting anything at all.I generally do not write reviews on products that I would assume would \"stand on their own.\"  However, the 300 HS has me a bit perplexed, and here's my assessment:Image quality:  Less sharp than any of my previous Elphs.  This is most noticeable at the wide angle (4.3mm/24mm equiv to 35mm).  The sharpness improves as you step up the zoom but still less sharp as any of my previous Elph models.  However, the depth of color and contrast is the best of all my previous Elphs thanks to the 1/2.3\" (6.17 x 4.55 mm) CMOS sensor and the DIGiC 4 processor.  The softness is very noticeable on images taken at wide angle.  The center of the image is very soft and gets progressively worse away from the center.  If you take a landscape picture, this it isn't as noticeable.  However, if you take pics of your kids three feet away, you will notice it.  These pics are useable especially for small prints (3x5) and of course online publishing on social media sites.  The sharpness improves on pics taken zoomed-in (tele), but they still are NOT as sharp as my other Elph models.  The softness can be seen viewed even at 30% zoom on a normal computer screen.  On the flip-side, the 24mm equiv is a nice feature to get those wide shots.  For a P/S, this is very wide.  The widest angle my other Elphs models were 28mm and 35mm (of course 35mm equiv).  (My Nikon dSLR only gets 26mm equiv with a 17mm lens.  Of note:  for those wanting more \"tech-y\" info: the image quality in 24mm focal length is far worse than my other Elphs in terms of sharpness, chromatic aberration, pincushion, and other distortions.  However, 300 HS favors f/2.7 (95%+ of 1500 pics taken thus far both indoor and out) which would certainly explain CA and sharpness!)(Sorry for a long review, I didn't intend it to be so long but I know someone hopefully at Canon will read this?)Picture taking modes: First of all, this isn't a dSLR.  It isn't meant to be.  That said, it does not take as sharp focused pics compared to older Elphs.  I use the \"Children & Pets\" mode and the fastest the shutter will take is 1/60th of a second.  Really?  However, the fastest the shutter will go is 1/2000 of a second!  I think this is a programming issue that Canon can easily fix.  The shutter speed for Children & Pets should be higher like 1/80 to about 1/250.  Certainly 1/60 is insufficient for kids.  1/20 to 1/60 is a great range for indoor non-moving subjects.  The rest of the modes are adequate, scenery and hand held night shots are very nice, although don't expect sharp focused pictures.  Later, I will post on Flickr some of these samples with the modes and all the meta-data (i.e. shutter, ISO, and aperture info).The CMOS sensor (the \"HS\" name on the model) allows the camera to use super high ISO (\"film\" sensitivity to light) speeds without the pics being grainy or \"noisy.\"  This means you can take fairly decent indoor shots with or without the use of a flash.  I noticed \"jump\" in the image quality immediately compared to my other older Elph models.  Yes, this is a nice indoor scenery camera.  The 300 HS does very well at controlling noise at high ISO levels.Tech-y note: Overall the 300 HS favors open aperture, higher ISO, and then shutter in compensation in that order.  While this is super for portraits, this does very little for taking pics of children and pets, or any moving subjects.Bottom line: This 300 HS will get the image for remembrance sakes.  It'll get the \"job\" done.Recommendations?  If you can, wait for v2 of this model.  As for recommendations on competitive products?

If you like scrutinizing the image pixel by pixel, this is not the camera for you. However, someone who's a non-photographer and wants good-looking photos from a small camera in \"Auto\" mode will almost definitely love it.Likes:--------------1) Image quality is good for a camera in this price range. Yes, there is some mild corner softness at 100% magnification, and there are some chromatic aberrations in high contrast areas, but looking at the whole photo at any reasonable magnification, I'd be hard pressed to criticize the quality. The noise is well controlled, and there is enough fine detail to avoid the dreaded \"water color painting\" effect of some other popular cameras. Auto white balance does a good job under a variety of lighting, exposure is generally spot-on, and low-light images are better than I expected. ISO 1600 is usable for small prints in low light.2) Video quality is very good. It uses a high bitrate compression, which eats memory fast, but I can see details in the video that other cameras simply smudge over. My only complaint is that the 1080p video is recorded at 24fps, and is somewhat choppy in motion. Switching to 720p or lower resolution results in 30fps video, which produces noticeably smoother motion. The stereo sound quality is decent, and the mics are plenty sensitive. When zooming during video recording, there is some motor buzz that's picked up by the mics, but it's only noticeable in a quiet environment.3) I like the 24mm wide angle lens, and prefer that over some 100x mega-zoom. It lends itself well to landscape shots, interior shots, close-ups, and other creative photography scenes.4) The camera is pretty quick to power on, and the controls have good response. It focuses in under 1 second, there is minimal shutter lag, and shot-to-shot times are about 2 seconds.5) The controls are intuitive, well-organized, and the buttons are plenty big for such a small camera. I had most functions figured out in a few minutes without having to resort to the manual. The mode switch provides a convenient thumb rest when holding the camera.6) Construction and build quality seems solid. I bought mine at a local store and made sure to get the version made in Japan. I haven't observed the problems mentioned by other reviews, like shaky video zoom or easily scratched finish. The battery door seems somewhat fragile, though.Dislikes:--------------1) When completely zoomed out, the lens casts a shadow from the flash in the lower right corner.2) Video mode is mostly automatic, you can't even adjust exposure compensation. I have older compact cameras which can do this, it would have been nice to have that feature here.3) The quick-set menu is somewhat slow to operate because it does not present as much information at once as other cameras, for example Panasonic's Q-menu. It's a vertical layout with vertical submenus, whereas a horizontal layout with vertical submenus would have been better.4) There is no wind-cut option for the microphones.I'm not taking points off because these are relatively minor issues, considering the camera is aimed at a novice user. It's not perfect by any means, and it's missing some toys found in other cameras, like a high resolution screen, auto HDR, or auto-stitching panorama. However, if your priority is the end result - the quality of images or video coming out of the camera - this one stands above the competition.

I've had good experiences with Canon quality before, so I was already leaning in that direction. I also didn't want to spend more than $200.This camera has exceeded all my expectations. It is truly lightweight, I have no problem taking it with me on everyday excursions, just in case I see something I think would be worth shooting (my camera phone is woefully inadequate). It is also VERY durable. I have dropped this camera twice (not in its case), both times from about four feet above the ground. Once it landed on concrete, the other time on a wood floor. As a result, the black casing is slightly scuffed up now, although it's not hugely noticeable. AND, the camera has continued to work perfectly. Considering we live in an age where so many things are made withough much regard to quality, since it is expected that we'll re-buy/upgrade our possessions constantly, I am truly gratified to see that Canon obviously made this camera intending for it to last.As to image quality, I am an amatuer, not really even at enthusiast level yet, but I think the image quality is really great. I also appreciate all the different scene modes and filters, and it's been so interesting working with them, that this camera actually inspired me to pursue photography again more seriously. I have a Nikon DSLR, but it was too much to lug everywhere, so I kind of just abandoned photography in general. But the Elph 300 has been so much fun to use, it inspired me to buy another digicam with shutter and aperture priority modes, so I can get back to exploring photography more fully yet still conveniently (and maybe even put my Nikon to full use someday).Speaking of manual controls, that's really the only thing this camera lacks (it does have Program mode, so you do have a bit of control over white balance and ISO). The Elph 500 does have the manual controls the 300 lacks, but I despised the touch screen, which I found was not nearly as responsive as, for example, an iPhone. But, keep in mind, this camera was never intended to be targeted to people who want full manual control. It's a small, take anywhere point and shoot that takes great pictures without you having to fiddle with it or think much about it. And as I said, there is some increased flexibility with the filters and scene modes provided (and there are quite a few of them).There may be a learning curve with the menu system for non-Canon users, but nothing that a little bit of time and the manual (in PDF form, it's not printed) wouldn't take care of. Current Canon owners will find it very familiar and easy to use.I would recommend this camera whole-heartedly for anyone who wants a lightweight P&S; with great image quality, that's also simple to use and still provides a good number of creative options. This would be a wonderful intro camera to those completely new to digital photography. I gave this camera 5 stars because, for the audience it's intended for, it's an oustanding choice, and one which I can't find any fault with. People who want full manual controls will need to look elsewhere (e.g. higher-end digicams and DSLRs), but for a well-built, no-fuss camera you can take anywhere and have a lot of fun with, this is an excellent choice.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "An amazing small camera", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "RBUC2KZ6PRED3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this on Amazon because I read a bunch of reviews on other websites (cnet, ect.) and they all recommend it.

Many pictures looked sharp on the LCD even when zoomed in, but they were blurry on the computer screen.  I do not have this problem with my similarly priced Sony WX9 which has a super high resolution LCD.  2) Rounded, curved, bubbly design maybe cute but it is slippery in the hand, increasing the chance of you dropping it. Also it will not stand upright easily, it is very tippy.  Which means if you set it on top of something to snap a timed picture or a night shot, there is good chance it will tip over, drop, and get heavily damaged.  3) All images are VERY SOFT even at the finest compression setting. There is no way to crank up the sharpness inside the camera. Expect to use software to crank up the sharpness on EVERY image  you decide to keep, which is a tedious and time-consuming task.  4) The HD video is limited to only 10 minutes which is stupid and just short enough to piss you off. On the Sony WX9 recording time is limited as well, but at 29 minutes, it is decent and just  long enough to be satisfying because usually the battery will expire before the cut off time. It also gobbles up a HUGE amount of memory as well!  5) Battery cover looks and feels EXTREMELY flimsy. Opening the cover shuts off the camera, which means hot swapping memory cards is not possible. It takes quite a bit of force with your thumb  to close the slippery cover, and it feels very unrefined, coarse and cheap with no positive tactile sensation at all.

I am not comparing this to a 2700.00 Canon 5D Mark II, and neither should you.I have another inexpensive, HD video camera, the Sanyo CG20( a dedicated video camera) and the Canon blows it away in both High Def video, and still photography.You can consider me a semi pro, in reference to still photography, and I can tell you the still images that this little camera produces, are quite good.  Again, not comparing it to a DSLR.The camera is very small and light, and will make an excellent backpacking camera.  I haven't been taking a lot of still images, because I didn't want to pack one of my DSLRs, and carry an extra 5 or 6 lbs, plus the hassle of trying to fit it into an already over stuffed pack(40lbs), and then unpack it quickly, when a deer, or bear or something steps across the trail.Sound:This camera has two little stereo microphones, and the audio quality is quite good when it is in your hand. I haven't tried it on a tripod yet, and will update this review when I do.  After recording a video, and upon playback you can barely hear the audio in the field, but don't worry, it sounds fine when you play it back on your computer.Video Quality:Excellent for the cost and size of this camera, and quite good in general.  Good color balance, good exposure(when using Exposure Compensation) and good definition, and detailPhoto Quality:Again very good in the point and shoot realm, and good in general across the board, taking all camera styles into account.  I have 2 DSLRs for reference, and taking those into account, this is very good for what it is.Controls:Very good for a point and shoot.  It has a dedicated video recording button that works well, with the exception that when you push it upon stopping video, you will get a little shimey in the very last segment of your video.  Not a big deal, just trim it out.Advanced video, and Photo control:There are only two things this camera is missing as far as advanced controls.  One is manual focus capabilities, and the other is manual shutter capabilities for still photos.  With those two added, or even manual focus added, this would blow me away.Shutter Lag:From the reviews I read before hand, if you prefocus(push the shutter button down half way) it is one of the fastest point and shoot cameras, if you don't(and just push the button when you want to take a picture) it is one of the slowest...  .1 second if you prefocus, and .49 seconds if you don't.  In my experience, the camera definitely has some lag, but I expected this, and it isn't an issue for me.  It is MUCH faster than my mother in-laws older Sony, which has lag to a point that it is an issue.  I think advanced focusing algorithms slow the process down. I recommend that if you have the camera, try prefocusing, while you are waiting for the shot.Important outputs:Of course, USB to download to the computer, and a mini HDMI port to play directly on your High Def television.The not so nice:As I said, lack of manual focus, a slight tendency to overexpose(easily fixed with exposure compensation through the dedicated button), and you can barely hear the sound track when you play back videos in the field.For the cost, I bet this is one of the very best!  I am very pleased!For samples of video, and still pictures, go to my website at markdfellows. c o m and look at the very bottom of the \"Mark's Hiking page\" link.A great camera!UPDATE AT OF OCTOBER 7TH, 2011:I wrote Canon an email and despite what the manual says about \"Exposure Shift\" in movie mode, there is no manual settings for this.  Must be something the camera does internally.I found out that putting the camera in \"Aquarium, or Underwater mode\"(the mode with a fish)gives you really vibrant, well saturated colors with good highlights, so try using that mode, for vibrant videos.  Be warned though, it can trash skin tones.I have just started playing around with aspect ratios, which you can set in this camera from 1:1 to 16:9(wide screen) which should give me hours of enjoyment.  I think I am going to try shooting in 16:9 mode.  I like the look.I definitely recommend you experiment with all the modes, it gives you some nice options, and in my case, led to me finding out that if I use that mode with the fish as the indicator, you will have well saturated colors and better highlights.  I have also tried a low light video with just a campfire that I am pretty pleased with the results.More videos are available by going to youtube, and typing in \" the suburban hippie experimentalist\" in the search field.  I hope this helps!

Something to fit in the pocket, good build and reliable brand.2. Good quality pictures, for a compact, but didn't need to compete with SLR quality. Not keen on supersaturation or over-sharpening.3. At least 28mm wide angle, with zoom of 4x or more. f2.8 or better is also good.4. Flash available, but lower-light capability is a plus and something I generally prefer.5. Prepared to go without RAW, aperture/speed priority in order to keep the cost and size down. Exposure compensation is needed though.6. Video capability, with zoom and continuous focus available while shooting.7. The ergonomics need to be good. Core functionality done well trumps number of features.So after much reading and some handling, the Canon ELPH 300HS seemed to be the sweet spot and I bought one in June. Two months later, and 1,200 photos have confirmed that it meets these criteria without excessive expense. I like the 24mm wide angle and 5x zoom, and it has better than expected capability in low light - presumably helped by them keeping to 12MP - a good move. Videos are very nice to watch, surprisingly good really, and it's a great fit for the pocket.I like the coarser feel of the black model rather than the smooth metal silver version - it's a personal preference but I feel less likely to drop it as I don't have a strap attached. The screen is good, even at 2.7\" and with mediocre eyes.The battery lasts a reasonable time, but unfortunately seems to give only a dozen or so shots warning before it stops. Have a spare available.I bought a small soft rooCASE Neoprene Sleeve (Grey) Carrying Case for it and its very satisfactory. It has a side pocket for the spare battery but that does make it a bit bulkier so I now leave it out. Bit of a shame but want to keep things slim so I do carry it.Yes, I could spend more and get a larger sensor, a bigger zoom, RAW, more control, etc., but size starts increasing and the whole idea was to have it with me without having to think about bulk play-offs every time you go out. It can't match my SLR's quality, but the pictures sure beat opportunities missed by having no camera (or just phone camera) there at all. It's not perfect, but quality and feel are good, it's well set out, and I expect this will do as my little camera for a good number of years.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Camera!!!", "Author": "CaffeinatedCajun", "ReviewID": "R2W045YET9R02S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The image quality is outstanding!  let me list some of the things i love the most about this camera:- Low light pictures without a flash look INCREDIBLE- Start-up time before able to take a picture is almost instant- Picture to picture shot time is so fast its like using a DSLR- the lighting in pictures look outstanding, and i get asked frequently \"What kind of camera do you have?!\"- Its so tiny it fits in my pocket and doesn't look like i'm excited to meet youIts an amazing camera for $200 and gives the Canon S90 a run for its money!

A 240k LCD may have been good 3 years ago but my cell phone has had a better LCD for years, it's definitely an important part of the camera so you can see what you have shot in the field. They should have stepped it up a little more here. The form factor on the other hand is VERY good. It's the best looking small camera I have ever owned. The controls on the 300 hs are better than my old Canon.Despite having a back-lit CMOS chip, pictures indoors were washed out, blurry and extremely grainy. My old canon had this problem too, in fact ALL Canon compacts have this problem. They cannot seem to perform well indoors. The photos were either washed out so you could not see any detail, or they were grainy and blurred. Think night time security camera.Outdoors, the performance improves significantly, but still not enough to replace my old Canon. Bright light will completely blow out objects. Distortion is harsh outside around the edges of the photo. Trees for example become silhouetted by light lines. Outdoors on a sunny day is usually where canon compacts shine, but the 300sh is a big disappointment here. The colors however were extremely accurate, but if you are looking for a camera to take to the slopes, look elsewhere. I took it to a football game expecting to get some good action shots and almost every shot was blurred and hazy IN BROAD DAYLIGHT!The macro was the biggest disappointment of them all. This is usually another point where canon compacts shine, but with this one, I had a very hard time focusing on what I wanted, shots also blur a lot easier than my old camera. I am a big fan of macro sots. this is one point that has inspired me to return the camera. Honestly my Blackberry torch does smoother macro than this one...At one time cheap canon compacts were my instant go-to solution for a carry around. This camera felt like an old camera.

Going by the specs I don't dive too deep because I've never been unhappy with Canon.  I breeze past low-ball ratings because people can't figure it out or don't like a feature. I've found a few fundamental problems with this camera.The focus on the camera in general is great but the speed between you pressing the button and it shooting is way too long.  Low or high light.The flash takes literally 10 seconds before you can take another photo.  I understand this is a point and shoot, but thats insane.  I've used a lot of cameras and 10 seconds is way too long.  Tell a one year old to hold that pose.  Good luck.  You just missed it.The battery is weak.  I've taken great care to properly charge this battery and have cycled through it about 10x and it's gotten a bit better.  You'll need to buy a few more so you can use this camera like a normal one.  Shooting video kills it as expected but 15 minutes of 1080 will fully kill this battery.  15 Minutes.  I've played with the auto focus and the focus settings but it's still a battery killer.  I'm fully aware that video will kill these but seriously 15 minutes.  So take video out of the mix and you'll still get hopefully 50-75 photos.  Flash also throws a wrench into the battery of course so cut that number by 50%.  I have 3 batteries so this isn't a bad battery I got from Canon.It's a bad design or bad firmware because if this is how it's supposed to work this is my last Canon.  That said, when it works it looks really nice.  I'm even happy with the video.  Canon still has a chance to fix this camera with firmware and I sure hope they do.  The size is perfect but can we all agree it's thin enough?  Can we make some/any advance in battery life?  This camera went backwards.

I decided on Canon because I had one years ago and really liked it.  The quality seems to have gone downhill. The best feature is the compact size.  I find the \"smart auto\" not to be so smart.  The images are usually over-exposed and at times out of focus.  It's as if the camera can't figure out what I want to photograph and instead picks some detail I'm not interested in.  The menus are not obvious and I have to keep running to the computer to read the manual, which is not very handy if I'm away from the computer.  I got this to replace an old HP digital camera that took great photos.  The image quality of the Canon is much worse.  I suspect that the HP had a much better quality lens.  The battery needs to be recharged after about 170 photos.  I haven't tried the video yet, but I suspect that will shorten the battery life even more.  I was used to taking 250-300 photos with my previous camera before changing the battery.  I read some reviews that said not to even bother with the smart auto mode and I think they are right.  I need to experiment with the \"P\" mode to see if I can get some decent photos with this camera.  I had considered getting a cheaper model of the Canon powershot camera but opted for this more expensive one because of the extra feature.  I think the extra money was not well spent since the Canon ELPH 300 performs about as well as a camera costing half as much.  To be fair, I've only had the camera a week and there is a steep learning curve.  If things improve over the next few weeks, I'll add an update and may give this camera a higher rating.  At this time I'm feeling disappointed.Addendum (6/5/11): I've now had several more days to play with the camera and after trying all kinds of settings the picture quality is not much better.  I finally made some videos, which looked nice, but the microphones picked up a lot of extraneous noise even indoors in a quiet room and introduced a kind of background hum into the audio.  If the quality of sound doesn't matter to you, the videos are quite nice.  I've decided to keep the camera because it's so compact and I plan to take it on trips.  The photos are passable but nothing spectacular.  The problems with focusing and overexposure have continued.  I think the lens is just not as good quality as in previous cameras I've owned, including an old Canon.  Maybe the fault lies in me since I'm not an expert on photography. A friend who is a serious photographer offered to go over the camera with me, so after we get together I'll have a better idea.Addendum (6/24/11):  I had this camera for over 3 weeks now and have taken hundreds of photos with it.  My original impression has not changed.  It takes decent photos in general.  The AUTO feature is useless and needs to be avoided outdoors because it totally over-exposes the photos.  It's kind of ludicrous that you can't use the AUTO feature outdoors on a point and shoot camera.  Indoors the AUTO function is acceptable.  The Programable mode does a better job, and it's all that I use now.  Generally I'm disappointed with the quality of the images and It think this has to do with the cheap lens this camera uses.  As I said previously, it is nowhere near the quality of previous Canon cameras I have owned.

Fits very easily in my shirt pocket and really lightweight.2. Picture clarity: This is really good. Took about 30-40 pictures near the lake and experimented with the different scene settings [foliage] - I can see the difference clearly.Cons:The LCD screen is quite large [compared to the A95] and is always open.

It took reasonably great photos with a few exceptions. I half expected the Canon to be on par since it is 12.1 Mp with similar features, knowing that the technology had improved over the last 5 years, even though it cost half as much. The Sony was fully \"touch screen\" while the Canon is not. I just received it today and after charging the battery, took a variety of indoor & outdoor pictures, with and without flash, wide angle and zoomed. I did not test the video feature as I use a good Sony HD video camera and a GoPro HD video camera as well. I didn't buy the Canon for the video feature even though it got good reviews for the 1080 video quality.These are my initial positive impressions:1) better than average (compared to the Sony) in low-light (no flash) conditions.2) about the same weight as the Sony digital although thinner which makes it possible to store in a shirt pocket.3) turns on and is ready to shoot in half the time that the older Sony took.4) without reading the manual, I went through all the set ups successfully in 5 minutes easily (very intuitive UI).5) happy to see that it can shoot in 16:9 aspect ratio as this makes it easier to import into video presentations at the same ratio.6) at the mid brightness setting, the LCD screen is much brighter than the Sony at full brightness setting.7) with a SDHC card with a 4 Rating (not high), I was surprised at the rapid transfer rate. Slightly better than the Sony with the more expensive proprietory Duo-Pro card.Why only 4 stars ?  I reserve all 5 star ratings exclusively for products that exceed my expectations. 4 Stars means that it met all my expectations.Side note: I replaced the Sony because it developed an issue that I was surprised to see in a camera in that range. It was meticulously handled, never abused, carried in it's own case, inside another camera case. It developed a problem with either the CMOS or the image stabilization. When shooting indoors with excellent lighting, it produced blurry pictures while flashing an icon which interprets as \"either insufficient light or camera is not held steady enough\". Even on a tripod, with the camera set to use the timer, it still produced the flashing icon and blurry pictures. A very negative ordeal with Sony CR convinced me that Sony was no longer the brand to have ... in my opinion.One Year Later ..... after using the camera extensively for 1 year now, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this camera. With decent lighting the camera takes beautiful pictures. Every now and then a few don't turn out as expected but they are probably in a less than 1% occurance ratio. The 1080p video function requires better light than the photo mode but when it's sufficient, the video is totally gorgeous. I would probably bump this up to FIVE STARS if the edit function allowed it.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "If you are a laymen to point and shoot cameras, here's an easy review if this is for you.", "Author": "Desert Rabbit", "ReviewID": "R2EUQ1CJQHDGIL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A great camera, ranked 3rd among snapshot.com base on pricing, compact, sensors, etc against all the other point and shoot competitors that were even $499-$599 in retail price. I bought this during Black Friday on Amazon and it was $149. Its a great deal considering its one of the smallest to have a 24mm lens, shoots 1080 HD video (high quality). Its macro (shooting in close up) lets you close in on your subject up to 3cm in distance, something the Canon s95 (priced $299) couldn't even do. The one big thing that I couldn't stand is the sandpaper body. I have a sensitive touch and every time I pick up the camera, I have goosebumps. My girlfriend on the other hand, doesn't get any of this. I still give the camera a 5 star because the pros really out weight the cons. However, if you don't like the touch of really rough sandpaper, this will really get in your way. The low light of this camera is decently acceptable with canon's HS technology even though its sensor is a 1/2.3 meaning to say if you're shooting photos indoor, this camera will give you better results than most of the others competitors. But of course you can't compare this to a DSLR or higher end proconsumer camera because those sensors costs way more than this camera itself.If you're a casual photographer, this camera is decent enough to get you through most photo and video shoot. Lots of folks I know talk about camera lens, sensors, low light, af, noise, color of a particular camera saying the picture quality is bad or whatsoever without even realizing that even professional photographers have to depend on 3rd party flash light, great daylight and software manipulation to attain that stunning photo. The canon elph 300 HS is by far the best bargain for the cheapest and smallest point and shoot camera.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Makes you fall in love with photography all over again", "Author": "Espy", "ReviewID": "R3CY0V17JG3RQN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always updated my digital camera every couple years, but this is the first time in a long time that a device has made it \"fun\" to shoot photos again.

Therefore, it takes a a few shots to get used to not getting your fingers in the way of the flash, lens and microphone.  The microphone is located on the top panel, with two small holes.One strategy of getting to know the camera prior to your purchase is to go to a local electronics store and seeing the camera (or a similar one) first hand.As with any camera or electronic purchase, it's best to find one that fits your needs.Remember this camera will take high-quality pictures and videos, which will translate to increased power consumption (consider one or two back-up batteries (size/type: NB-4L) and mandate high-capacity memory cards.Our fellow reviewers have gone into much greater depth and all have done a fantastic job at thorough explanation.I hope this review serves as a validation to the quality and value of the Canon ELPH 300hs.

Overall, I can say that I'm kinda satisfied given that I wanted a small pocket-sized camera that takes good video WITH optical zoom. I wasnt really looking for or expecting great photos.PROS :1. It fits into my purse beautifully, is light and doesnt weigh down my purse (with all the other junk inside it), and form factor is wonderfully portable. Moms : you will love this! :-)2. Video with optical zoom on a small point and shoot!! Yoohoo! This is the main reason I bought it. Of course, you have to hold the camera very steady otherwise there is video-shake, but that is to be expected since this is such a tiny camera. I like the slow 5X optical zoom, because it doesnt cause jumpy video. So far, I've taken lots of video of my kid using this, and quality is very acceptable for my standards (which are not very high).CONS :1. The photos that I've taken so far are really disappointing. I have read other reviews saying they got very good pics, so that is leading me to wonder if I'm doing something wrong here. I cant beleive that a Canon would take grainy pics (even in broad daylight, shooting in Auto mode with largest resolution). Not that I'm expecting DSLR quality, mind you, but I was really surprised at the lack of color richness and sharpness. Can someone please let me know if I'm missing something here? I've owned a Nikon Coolpix point and shoot in the past which took way better photos than this one.Overall, since it meets my specific needs, I'm keeping this camera.

HOWEVER, my main beef with it is that, while it's advertised as a pocket camera, my experience is that keeping it in your pocket will ruin it.I shoot pictures all the time with many different cameras-SLRs, DSLRs, one-time film, Polaroid, and this one.  I always have a camera ready, but this camera that fits in my pocket is one that I take almost everywhere.  The problem is that the lens cover can be easily opened when rubbing on the liner of the pocket, which it has to do when going in and out of the pocket.  I have taken it out many times to find one of the two halves open and that allows dust inside.  Over many months, dust has gotten into the workings of the lens and now when I zoom, a constellation of grey splotches appear all over the image.  Now it's at the point where dust won't allow one of the halves to close at all with some prodding from my finger. Yes, it is my fault for not take the best care of it, but having the camera at the ready in my pocket lets me take a picture in 2 seconds from taking it out and pushing the power button while bringing it up to look at.  No lost pictures, which would happen if I always kept it in a case.So, it's something to consider, even though this model is now obsolete.  It takes fantastic photos like I said and I think I'll buy another model just like it.  I like the quality of the camera and the photos it takes and I also like that it's NOT touch screen and it's NOT WI-FI (I don't always want to be connected).  I'll just take better care of it.

This little gem can take the best photos, and I absolutely love the new sensor for low lighting shots.  The wide angle lens really makes every shot you take seem more realistic as well.  I haven't had time to try out the video quality yet, but I can only imagine it will be great, as other reviewers have commented on.  I bought this one to take the place of a three year old Nikon Coolpix touchscreen camera.  The battery doors on them had a common problem which mine eventually succumbed to,  so I decided to trade up for this Canon.  The Elph 300 HS did not disappoint me.  It is so small, I can put it in an old cell phone case that I had, or even inside a Fossil wristlet that I carry sometimes.  I'm taking it on vacation in two weeks to Europe for a river cruise there.  I plan to take lots of shots as it will be with me at all times.  That's what is so great about the size of it.  No weight to lug, not big or bulky at all, and you still get awesome photos.  The software cd that comes with it makes transfer of photos a breeze.  Even that is much better than the Nikon transfer software.  For the price range of around $150-200, this one is a definite contender.  You should consider it if you don't want your smartphone battery dying on you in the middle of a great vacation.  The battery lasts quite a long time so I plan to get through each day without any problems.

I can put this bad boy in my pocket and think it's a phone.When I hold on to the camera itself, it doesn't feel fragil - but rather, sturdy and \"Tight\". No loose parts or thin wall feeling.I like the slow motion camera recording - but it can't do it for long periods though as it heats up and uses a lot of battery in the process!Pictures turn out great most all the time. Inside pictures take a little more time to focus (half pressing the shutter button and then letting go, and then half pressing again till it focuses correctly). Outdoor pictures are great! I just wish there was a way to stop all camera pre-processing of the pictures I take and allow me to modify the color if it needs it.I've had this camera for almost 2 years now and the only things that have gone wrong are: The shutter for the lens wouldn't shut all the way, leaving the lens exposed. The other problem that happened was that it records a motor noise when I record video when zooming. The first problem was resolved with Cannon itself due to it being within the one year warranty period (they gave me a refurbished camera + all the original stuff that came with the camera in the first place! From the battery to the charger and cables! Lovin' it!... and just a note, 10 months after ownership, I had that problem with the lens shutter not working correctly). The second problem is in the middle of being resolved with the company I got the added insurance from.It doesn't take long for it to turn on, resulting in me taking pictures at work of people doing things they'd not want reminded of later (Like running in a field / sleeping on the job / goofing off...).

It is ready to snap in less than a secondNumber of images per battery charge:  I took over 200 images without flash and the battery charge indicator had not gone down.  I am sure flash will affect that, but for outdoors and low light pics in museums, etc. it will be great.Picture quality:  excellent.  The 12mp make the images very detailed especially compared to my older 5mp camera.Low Light:  very good.  I have taken many pictures of paintings and prints inside my house with no light and they are all very good.  It should be excellent in museums this summer.Image focus:  excellent.  The focus boxes come up quickly when the shutter button is pressed half way down and I have had no pictures out of focus once I get the focus boxes to show.Rough Texture:  I bought the black 330 HS. A lot has been made of the \"new\" texture but it is only slightly textured and very easy to hold.  I think it is a big improvement.Among things that I have not read in other reviews:Zoom setting: There is a setting that disables digital zoom so that when you zoom it is only within the optical zoom.  This is a lot better than my old camera with which I had to be careful not to \"enter\" the digital zoom as the picture became pixelated when you did.  This may be standard in all cameras now, but I didn't have it on my old camera.Charger weight:  Is only 2oz.  I was slightly concerned that it would weigh more.  It is only 7/8\" x 3.5\" x 2 1/8\" and will be very handy to carry when traveling. It plugs directly into the wall and handles 100-240v so can be plugged into foreign plugs with only the simple adapters.  We may not have to take our \"brick\" transformer this year.Flash turn off:  This is on the main function setting on the back of the camera and is very easy to switch quickly when entering a museum that does not allow flash pictures.  A nice big icon that is always present indicates flash on or off.Auto Setting:  So far it seems that I can take all my pictures with this setting with the ability to turn the flash on and off.  My old camera required me to go into the \"special\" pictures and choose \"museum\" to turn the flash off and get low light pictures which were often pixelated.Video:  I have not used a lot of video before, but this camera is very easy to use for video.  Push one button on the back and you are taking video.

I have yet to make prints from this camera, although they look great after uploading to iPhoto.I bought this for backpacking trips and other outdoor endeavors where an iPhone doesn't come close to achieving the desired effect.  The startup time on this ELPH is very fast.  It definitely handles low light very well, although it does try to \"think\" too much.  It is often necessary to point the lens at a brighter or darker area to achieve the desired lighting effect while in Auto.  The alternative would be to try each of the many programmable settings for each shot, although this somewhat defeats the purpose of using a point and shoot to capture transient moments.  The macro mode turns out some spectacular images, although it is not always easy to focus on the appropriate object.  I had to give up on several shots after the camera continued to focus on the background instead of the object in the foreground.Bottom line, the Auto mode is inconsistent, but when it \"chooses\" correctly, the images are beautiful.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Go-To Camera for Home and Travel", "Author": "Darby", "ReviewID": "R3KCOXZIP33X2C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We already have the same camera, which is why we ordered this one.The camera is compact and light, takes great pictures of scenery, people, nature.

You can also easily turn the flash off, this is also nice. The final thing about this camera is the large view screen.

The silver one is sharper looking than the black one.  The brown lettering is cool, people say.  Anyway.This is a far superior camera to an Nikon S01 that I have briefly and is barely bigger.

It was out of the warranty period and was not worth the cost of paying Canon to repair it.  The 300HS was less expensive but I believe that it is substantially better than the 1400. The pictures are much more clear and the color is much better.  Indoor shots are better and if one uses the program mode, adjusting the white balance yields much better color reproduction, especially under tungsten lighting.  It is often unnecessary to turn on the flash when a normal amount of lighting is present but hold the camera steady.  The video is clear and sharp but when using the zoom while capturing video, you can hear the whir of the motor as it moves the lens housing in or out, however, it is a minimal intrusion.

Just a regular guy who likes to play at taking pictures.This camera is simple to use and produces good images decently quickly.  Personally, I don't see much of a difference between the quality level of the major manufacturers at this price point, so I say it's a good idea to head to some place where you can put your hands on each model, see which one feels right to you, and has a user interface you prefer.The form factor is great.  It's no big deal to keep this camera on you all the time, slides in and out of pockets fairly easily since the only real protrusion is the zoom toggle, which also acts as a bezel for the shutter button, and it is nicely rounded so it does not catch easily.  The available buttons are easy to find by feel, with a small exception being the the Func. Set button, but that generally happens when you put a button in the middle of a circular pad.The interface is greatly simplified.  For the most part, you're trusting Canon's engineers to figure out and apply the proper variables to your pictures.  This is even true of the Program mode where you have more control, but many features for more fine control are locked away from the user.  For example, there are over a dozen different modes (such as \"landscape\", \"fireworks\", \"portrait\", etc.)  installed on this camera, and  you can only manually select a fraction of them.  Generally, this is no problem as the automated systems do a good job of selecting the proper settings, but generally does not equal always.For those of you who want more control, there is a firmware extension you can get called \"CHDK\" that will give you much more detailed control and does work on the Elph300HS.The video function, I can't really speak on because aside from one test video, I haven't bothered with it.  Obviously, I think it bears pointing out that if you plan on taking a decent amount of video at full 1080p, you need as large and as fast of a memory card as you can afford.  1080p video is *huge*.I'm perfectly happy with the image quality so far.  Most all of my bad pictures have been because I was playing with CHDK and did something wrong myself.  I've taken around 1,000 shots so far with this camera and have yet to come across anything that even gets me slightly annoyed at it.  It's not perfect, but no piece of technology is.  It gives good image quality, but not great image quality; however, that's a function of giving less than $200 for a camera.  For what this camera is, at the price it is, I'm satisfied.All of that said, to address some of the points frequently brought up about this camera:Textured casing--personally, I like it.  People refer to it as a sandpaper like consistency, which I guess is true if you're talking about an extremely fine grit sandpaper.Camera Breaking--I'll update my review if this happens and change the score accordingly. From reading on the internet, the issues with it physically breaking seem to happen much more with the Chinese made models than the Japanese ones.

You get severe pin-cushioning on this small camera.Nonetheless, I think I'll keep both and perhaps use this one on my outdoor trips since it will get more abuse. It's definitely much slimmer, and more pocketable, though, I'd get a case for it. You really only have two choices from the canon line which is the psc-55 and the psc-1000. Do not get the psc-1050 as it will not fit. You may also want to go cheaper and just get a sleeve. You can purchase something like this from the palm pre line. It's a soft cloth that fits this camera perfectly. It also acts as cloth to polish your camera too.[...]I will say though, with this camera, you better have a steady hand for your indoor shots, still, a better value currently than compared to the newer 310HS which doesn't provide much more in my opinion.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera For the Price - Beware of Amazon incentives, though", "Author": "T.

Ya know, give the \"FUNC.SET\" group of buttons some texture or something, so you can feel them in low light conditions. I'm thinking canon could add to budget to have the text raised to give the buttons some relief with the profit they are making on this great camera.

The Nikon did cost me $135 , so I cannot bash it too much just because of the  price.  The biggest quality is the clarity of the HD video, every detail can be seen ,  and yes you can optically zoom while  recording.  Not  like the Nikon which could only digitally zoomed.  Unlike the Nikon, the footage didn't loose quality  while zooming. ( Digital zoom decrease quality on both , pictures and videos )It also  takes great pictures , I know , Isn't that supposed to be the  priority lolMy biggest issue is that it takes a lot of memory for the full HD.  If you don't have at least a 16 GB, you might reconsider  recording in full HD.  I am talking about 555 MB for a 2:07 seconds videos. Yes , you read that right, 555 Megabytes for a two minutes and seven seconds full HD video.  I have two Sandisks SDHC class 10 , one 4GB and one 16GB, the 4GB was almost full before I knew it .  For  Those of you who  are wondering, yes it is fast , nowhere near like a rapid shooting SLR  camera, but with the class 10 , you will get the best for your  money. I was getting  2 second lag between shots.  It was perfect for me although some people might consider that as very slow . Compared to the Nikon I returned , that was a great improvement just in that area,  the Nikon was Slower.Also a little advice, not all SDHC class 10 are the same. From my researches (please forgive me if I am wrong) I could only find one brand that could do 30 MB/S maximum and it was Sandisk.  At least on Amazon .Update: If you turn the preview off, it will take up to a second for the camera to be ready between shots.  It now feels like a rapid fire SLR.

I originally wanted a silver model, but the store didn't have it in stock. I would NEVER buy a black camera again, the re-sale value from the chipped paint would be zero, I think.4)  Picture quality is not up to par with bigger-lens point and shoots or SLRs. But again, unless you have a camera on you, you can't take a pic.5)  The focus accuracy is good in pic mode. In video mode, it's poor, for the lens will seek out the correct focus and go in and out of focus. If you're taking an important video, leave this camera at home. I have an older Canon point and shoot (A620) and the focus is excellent in video mode. If video focus is important, don't buy this camera. The focus problem exists whether recording or simply using it as a live monitor feed.6)  Dust gets inside the lens and you'll get dark spots on every image, more so when you zoom in. Since the camera is now out of warranty, I opened the camera up, moved the LCD upwards, unscrewed the image sensor, and cleaned the clear plastic that covers the lens with a Q-tip. The big spots are gone now, but little ones remain. My A620 has no spots at all, and it's many years old. I had a Sony point and shoot years ago and that too had a dust problem. I might buy the Sony with the fixed lens (the one where the cover slides upwards and downwards) to help avoid dust problems.7)  The 24 mm (if memory serves) equiv. zoom gives nice wide-angle shoots, but there is distortion. That was to be expected.So would I buy it again?

Easy to hold with very good grips. However, it was unable to withstand our trip. After the trip, the camera rotating knob that allows you to select different mode works. It is now forever stuck on Auto mode, luckily.Overall, great product.

However, after the second Canon PowerShot to die the same death with potentially dirt or fragile guide pins in the automatically retracting/extending lens...I have determined that this type of lens in general is a serious design flaw and should be avoided.With a camera at this price range, it's really not worth sending back for repairs, as it will be at least 1/2 the cost of the camera to repair.I would highly recommend people consider more ruggedized versions, or a \"sealed\" lens that does not have fully automatic extension/retraction. This may be available in some of the higher-end waterproof digital cameras out there on the market that do not have the concentric lens barrels that can get small dirt or sand particles stuck in them causing this error.

This camera cannot handle macro mode very well. More times than not, the photo ends up blurry. It also likes to not use the flash in situations that probably call for it. There is no way to force the flash that I can see. Its too bad when you have just enough light for the camera to think it doesn't need a flash, but you feel it needs one. Ultimately the photo suffers. And speaking of the photos. There is something very wonky with the color profile. When I adjust the tone, brightness and contrast of the photo in photoshop it always pushes the photo into a darker range and the colors are always a little bit off of what they should be. Its not a horrible camera. I'm sure it works much better doing outdoor photos in daylight, or photos from several feet away. Its just horrible for close up photos with indoor lighting (even in macro mode).

Yes, the bottom flap (over the battery casing) feels a bit cheap, but not when it's closed, only when it's open, and that's hardly ever.My main concern/issue with the camera isn't its construction, but rather in its photos. In indoor lighting conditions, especially the type of overhead poor lighting you see in offices and schools, it takes poor photos of people. How so? Well, on automatic, the color balance tends to make it appear as if everybody is wearing cake makeup. I also find the auto-white balance, when inside, to be rather too warm. In addition, on occasion the noise levels seem outrageously high (to be fair, I've also noticed the reverse, so that might just be on me.) You can overcome it by fiddling around on manual, but I just want to take decent photos of my classmates as soon as I turn my camera on. I also noticed it has a tendency to lack focus. So if you're lazy and take a lot of this type of photo, I'm not sure I'd recommend the camera. It does wonderfully in better lighting by windows and outside.The second issue I have with the photos it takes is the amount of fringing, which is more than I've ever experienced before. Granted, I've only shot with SLRs and my last two point-and-shoots, but it is significant and annoying. Still, it's hardly crippling.Otherwise, I found the camera to take very pleasing photos in decent lighting, retain very high amounts of detail in it's crisp macro shots, and be an improvement over my last Canon point-and-shoot. The images it makes are large and detailed, it does a good job of identifying faces (though it will see them where they don't exist, it finds them 90+% of the time when they are in the photo). Granted, I'm not sure how useful that is. It's good at preserving non-skintone colors, and I found that I can crop the images it takes about 50% and still have a usable photo. I never need the digital zoom, but I have played with it, and it's better than Canon's digital zoom used to be.The menus are not difficult to use, but their layout is inefficient, especially in manual mode. If you're buying a point-and-shoot to use in manual, (1) you have some introspection to do, and (2) this isn't your camera.I found it needs some urging to focus on the correct area of the photo, but what point-and-shoot doesn't? I also noticed distinctly lesser ISO noise in low lighting than in previous cameras I've owned, though more than you'd see in an SLR (of course).Overall, I'm happy I got the camera. It's inexpensive for the quality it delivers. It's lightweight, responsive and where lighting is passable, retains colors very well. It's not perfect, and its photos will never knock me off my feet, but I would have been foolish to expect a camera in this price range to be stunning.

A problem that can be expected for an older camera that's been everywhere with me.What I've found that really separates these types of cameras is how intuitive and functional the many options are. Getting around the camera's menu options takes lots of practice, and I've found other brands to be very difficult to learn.

If you're not someone that has been shooting for years you really should peruse the manual and get a grasp on what your options are. If you're old enough to have shot actual film, these cameras simply blow away your imagination.This model offers a 'tilt-shift' shooting option (referred to as \"miniature\") and fish-eye lens option. Both very useful and fun to make your images stand out.I always tell people the most critical component to getting a good pictures is to first, have a camera with you. If you own a large SLR with extra lenses you'll get some great pictures no doubt, but are you going to bring that camping or vacationing? Maybe, but it won't be with you all the time.

I thought I'd have to go with a bulky Four-Thirds camera or an SLR.  But the CMOS sensor in the 300HS does a nice job in low light.  It would be interesting if someone could do a side-by-side test to see how close this camera comes to, say, the Panasonic DMC-GH1K in this respect.  I also like the multiple-frames-per-second stills (even faster at 3 megabytes).  The 24mm (equivalent) lens is free of fish-eye distortion (except in extreme close-ups where you might actually want it), perhaps due to computed correction within the camera.It is a bit inconvenient to switch between functions because the buttons and the screen icons are small.  Although a rotating function dial like the ones that Panasonic and Fuji use would make switching easier, clearly there isn't room for one on a camera this small.  If the camera is to fit in a pocket this is one of the necessary trade-offs.I had been concerned that the 300HS would be significantly larger than the SD780IS it replaced, but no worries.  The difference in thickness, the most important dimension for me in a pocket camera, is not significant.

Now I got my first camera at the age of 6 (a Kodak Brownie). I have used almost all types since then from compact film cameras through SLR's and plate cameras.Even with loading my own film into the cassettes I had to take care when photographing any thing since the most shots you had on a roll would be about 45.  Then along came the digital camera at around 1.3mp. Fun, but not good pictures. The 5mp was very good for small prints. You might even get a 5x7 out of them. When the 10mp's came along I was very happy. Getting the Panasonic LX10 was quite a pleasant time for me since I was able to print an 11x8.5 that really looked great! Camera manufacturers could not leave well enough alone.  1: Increase the megapixel count for sharper pictures. More megapixels do NOT guarantee sharper pictures.  2: Add more processing for better color. You get oversaturated incorrect colors.  3: Use the same tiny sensor.Even a modest increase in mp count would add say 2 million pixels.  So what happened to this Canon? The test pictures I ran showed the following faults.  1: Oversaturation and unacceptable purple fringing at the corners in all modes.  2: Barrel distortion more noticeable at the edges.  3: Unsharpness across the entire photo even on 4x6 prints.  4: Bleeding of colors in bright sunshine.  So my conclusion must be that for uncritical vacation shots and people who just want to be able to recognize Uncle Chuck, this camera might just do.

I was looking for a small and light camera that I could take anywhere.  While my old powershot A620 still takes great pictures, I wanted a camera with newer features such as hd video and better low light performance.  My experience with the elph 300 hs has disappointed me in several ways.  Compared with my trusty A620, pictures taken with the elph 300 hs do not look nearly as crisp - almost soft, especially toward the corners and edges. I've played with settings and typically use P mode.  I just cannot seem to get decent pictures with this camera.  Other complaints I have are the autofocus speed, barrel distortion with wide angle, inconsistent exposure, weak flash, and horrible lens flare.  The bottom line is that the image quality simply isn't there with this camera.  While I would love to have a camera I can slip in a pocket, I am not willing to compromise image quality enough to use this camera when I want to take halfway decent pictures.  I will grab my A620 every time - even if it doesn't fit in a pocket. Of course, I am not expecting dslr performance from this little camera.  My basis for comparison is my experience with my A620, my kid's A590is, and my dad's sd1100is. This little camera has many features in a very small package & might be a fun little toy for someone who isn't picky about image quality.Pros:small, yet comfortable to hold and operateexcellent battery lifemany featuresexcellent burst modebuild qualitycolor is typically goodCons:image quality / softness, even when sharpness setting is adjustedblurring of corners and edgeslens flare - much worse than other point & shoot cameras I have used, makes pictures look washed out (vs. attractive flare)autofocus speed, autofocus in video modesound quality could be better - perhaps something to do with mic placement?

I can take this camera anywhere.  Sure, I'd get better pictures with my A620 or an slr, but there are some times when I wouldn't have a larger camera with me.  A larger camera certainly wouldn't fit in the pocket of my life jacket for a kayak trip or in the pocket of my \"skinny jeans\" when I am running around a park with my kids.

I've tested the slo-mo function and that was really cool, too.6) Size: this camera was quite slim and fits in pocket nicely7) Price: Bought it for 149 from AMZNCONS:Well, there wasn't any, really.  I was so tempted to purchase the S90 mainly because I heard it takes closer to DSLR quality photos, but I'm satisfied with my Elph300 purchase mainly because of size and price factors.  Plus, the Elph300 received quite a lot of good reviews and has been in many hands that will vouch for it.If I had to list some CONS, I'd probably say1) It didn't include an HDMI cable - since camera takes full 1080p, it would have been great to actually see this quality displayed on a TV screen2) On my ski trip, the camera fogged up on me most of the time, but I don't think that would have been avoided with any camera due to the quick change in temperature causing humidity to fog up the insides of the camera.All in all, great purchase!

The photo quality is great, auto focus is as fast as any other point and shoot camera, the menus are easy to navigate and the video quality top notch.  The one button video recording is the best feature and one of the reasons the camera was purchased.  It makes capturing the moment a snap without having to change settings on the camera.  There are a couplrpe things that could be improved.  1) The flash is where you naturally put your finger so it blocks the flash and ruins the picture in lower light settings.  You just have to be a little careful how you hold the camera. 2)  The zoom in and out seems a little slower than other cameras I have used.  It is adequate but ther have been a couple instances where the slower zoom lead to a lost picture.  3) It is almost too small.  It is easy to stash in your pocket but also very easy to drop.

My only (minor) complaints are that the switching of modes is all done via a menu, which can be a bit of a pain. Instead of having some sort of dial with some of the modes you might want to bring up quickly (like high speed mode).

It was a nice camera, but rather bulky for many occasions. I'd long wanted a super compact and this seemed to fit the bill, especially when it was on major sale at another establishment. Due to the price I paid, I almost gave this three stars, but found I couldn't recommend it at any price.On the plus side, the camera is very compact, very well built and has a very nice wide angle lens. I haven't used the HD video often, but it is much better than my old Lumix, though still has problems (see below). I actually like the simplicity of the settings, though the inability to easily override the basic settings has occasionally been a problem.On the negative side; the white balance is horrid. It will change even between consecutive pictures, especially in bright sunlight or low light. This happens with the HD video as well. It is quite annoying to be shooting a video of my granddaughter, shift the camera slightly and have the picture go yellow.(By comparison the Lumix was grainy and had poor color in low light, but in medium light and bright sunlight, the color was dead on. I miss that, especially at pools, the beach or the like.)The delay between pictures is excruciating at times. Sometimes it simply won't take a picture. I press the button, nothing happens, press it again, nothing happens, moment passes. Finally I can take a picture. Granted, this is common with digital cameras, but with Elph 300 HS seems worse than any I've used in this regard.The auto-focus is just plain weird. It's supposed to identify faces and focus on them. That works maybe half the time; the other half, it focuses on the most random things. On the other hand, you can force the focus point and it will track it correctly.I'm neutral on the flash. I've actually found it to be better than many other digital cameras I've used and I have fewer red-eye problems than with my Lumix (which also tended to overexpose a lot more.)* * *Update: Since I wrote this review, I've taken dozens of pictures, including some from a family vacation. Almost every picture is over saturated, has heavy yellowing and is soft. In several pictures with high contrast, the brights are completely blown out and the shadows over-exposed. I've had to color correct and sharpen almost every picture.This is a dreadfully bad camera where it counts--picture quality.* * *3/2/2014After returning from a vacation to Hawaii, I thought I'd lost all my pictures. Turns out they are still there and can be read by an SD card reader, but for some reason, the camera refuses to recognize them as valid. I suspect this is done in case one SD card is used in multiple cameras. Very disconcerting though.Another point is that while I'm still unimpressed with still images, the video it takes is quite good.

Seemed odd ... but i would push the shutter button and if would bring it back.  I checked my energy saving settings and the display was to stay on for 10 secs.  So, not sure what was going on.  Then, the camera would freeze up, with the green light on the back panel flashing, and no button/function working.  The only way to do anything, including turning off the camera, would be to remove the battery.  Would re-insert the battery and re-start the camera, but the camera would freeze up after any attempt to do anything (including viewing photos).So, hard to say much more about the camera since it is now useless.

One of the reasons I use my camera is to shoot some short videos at concerts. Each generation of Canon camera has been better than the previous one, until now.The biggest failure is that video is handled via a button, and not a setting. That means focusing is no longer an option. In a concert setting, with flashing lights and so much movement, the camera does a poor job of auto-focusing, leaving you with bad results.On top of that, the microphone seems to be of worse quality than previous models.Yes, we can zoom in now (a welcome feature) but if the video starts out blurry, zooming makes things worse. You need to stop filming and try again.And finally, the location of the button is hard to push, so most video start out shaky, because pushing the button moves the camera.Aside from the video mode, there has been a bad change in the camera mode. \"Micro\" is not handled the same as it was before, and especially in Auto mode, this camera always defaults to Micro before focusing on what's actually happening. So if you want to quickly pull out the camera and take a shot...don't.

Sometimes if ur taking a video the battery will blink but wen u stop recording & switch to camera mode it says u have 2 bars left, found that kinda weird, but the batt can die on u.

It's rough, it feels bad coming in an out of your pocket, a case, whatever.  Cleaning the screen is almost impossible because the \"texture\" grabs hold of most soft cloths that you would use.  I could easily see this snagging a sweater, etc.  The only thing I could imagine this texture would be for is improved grip, but honestly, I don't think that's ever been a problem for anyone.  These things are so light that it takes almost no effort to hold on to them.  The texture also collects any dirt or other particles around it.  After 5 minutes in my pocket (this is a pocket camera, after all) with what appeared to be a completely clean/empty hard candy wrapper, the camera came out covered in pink mess.  Also, the wrist strap on this model wasn't soft and flexible, but instead very stiff.  If I wasn't wearing it, but just grabbed the camera for a quick snapshot, I had to be very careful that the strap didn't stick straight out into the picture.  That should never be a problem one has to worry about.The picture quality on this camera isn't quite as good as it was on my previous model (SD770IS).  The quality isn't quite as sharp, the colors aren't quite as good, etc.  I can only hope that my particular camera was a fluke, both in the quality of the pictures and the roughness of the textures.

But it fails where it matters most - producing quality images in auto mode.Pictures are coming out soft, non-contrast, underlighted.

Big way falling. Pisa tower falling. Get your cropping skills polished.I bought this camera as a replacement for SD1400, which had another big problem - \"soapy\" corners on most pictures. So far I don't see how the new camera is better - it's still a lot of cropping, with even less contrast.I think, Canon got too carried away with adding new features and forgot about the most important thing - quality of the picture.The last reliable Elph I had was SD1200. With less pixels, less macros it was producing far better quality pictures than anything that came from Canon after it.Something tells me it's my last point-and-shoot from Canon.

Such a quality pictures, minimal distortion on a wide shots, and 14x zoom is simply unbeatable for the size.

I had just bought a different brand of compact P&S;, but returned it after I saw all the great ratings and reviews for the Elph 300HS from professional reviewers and customers. After having the Elph 300 HS camera for a month I am really surprised that so many reviews are positive, which have fooled me and others into going with this mediocre camera.  Yes, it looks nice and is small, but the image quality is very disappointing and there is no way to directly drag and drop the photos from the camera onto your computer.Image quality - This camera is touted as being good in low light due to Canon's update to better sensor technology in this model.  Far from being better in low light, it is much worse than my previous compact point and shoot.  Indoor images are blurred when anyone in them makes even the slightest of motion during the shot.  And they are not just a little blurred; they are significantly blurred even when the lighting in the room is good.  I also have experienced an excessive yellowness to images taken without the flash indoors.  With most cameras there is usually a nice warmness to photos taken indoors without flash, but the Elph 300 HS goes way beyond a nice warmness to excessive yellowing.Downloading photos - I am surprised that I read nothing about the lack of direct download capability in all my research on this camera.  I went on a weekend trip and afterward went to download my photos to my Mac like usual with all my prior cameras.  I have always dragged and dropped the photos onto my hard drive into folders, and only import them into software programs when I want to edit them.  When I connected the camera to several different computers, none of them show the camera as an external drive.  As a result, this camera does not allow dragging and dropping; you must use a software program just to get the photos to your computer.  You have to install and use the software from Canon's CD, or use iTunes or iPhoto or similar to get the photos from the camera to a computer.  This is a hassle and a waste of time.  After then searching specifically for this problem online, I found that some others have experienced the same issue and it appears to be the camera design and not a unique problem with my camera or computer.  Why doesn't Canon allow drag and drop?  I wonder if Canon could not get the camera to be so conveniently small if it had included whatever was needed to allow drag and drop, and thus it traded a capability that ever other digital camera I've had came with in order to try to appear so attractively small to buyers.  I never imagined I wouldn't be able to just drag and drop the photos because I've never known anyone who couldn't from their digital camera.With these major flaws already apparent after only a few weeks of use, I would not recommend the Elph 300 HS.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Please Don't buy!", "Author": "airmanxx", "ReviewID": "R15BYD2JDPAOJK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The 1 star reviews are not kidding!

The lens may be better in the older models as well, but that's just a hunch.As to another owners favorable review, I would disagree as to the concept of requiring a DSLR for \"professional pictures\" (the suggestion being that if you wanted great images you had to buy a DSLR -- you couldn't get them in a compact camera). I think many of the earlier Elph models are outstanding cameras and so does Ken Rockwell and most of the other camera review sites. The SD850, for example, shoots superlative images. Indeed, some so good that when looking at various images shot on holiday, with the Elph or with my Lumix (with Leica lens) I sometimes can't tell which camera shot which image.  On Ken Rockwell's site, photos taken with the Canon PowerShot S95 are absolutely DSLR quality.Another issue:  for those who plan to buy the black color version of this camera: the exterior finish is very rough, bordering on uncomfortable. The texture is almost prickly sharp to the touch. I hated it (in the store) and bought the smooth, silver model instead.DO YOURSELF A FAVOR: Read through the 2 star and 1 star reviews. Read the \"Comments\" too. There are too many reviews and comments reporting similar problem issues to be dismissed.

Three months later, however, the lens would not extend and the camera would immediately switch off (dreaded \"Lens Error\"). From a variety of news postings, it seems that this is not an uncommon problem in the ELPH because sand or dirt (you know, things that might end up in small amounts in your pocket) can get into the zoom assembly and cause it to jam. I sent in the camera, paperwork, and warranty to Canon. Canon then sent an email informing me that (1) they don't fix this camera, ever and (2) because of the unrelated damage, they won't offer a replacement (they would be happy to replace it with a refurbished unit for full price!). I then called the service number and spoke with two incredibly unknowledgeable and unhelpful customer \"service\" representatives who read to me from a script and who continued to refuse to honor the warranty.

LACK OF DETAIL in laments terms and for others the compression and more so I feel the digic 4 processor makes the camera for those who will need to take photos and edit USELESS.  HOWEVER, if you want a simple point and shoot and will never edit your photos then get it.  If you want something that allows you to lets say take shot where someone has closed their eyes and edit their eyes from another photo where they are open THIS IS NOT THE CAMERA FOR YOU!  (or me as I have done this with my Canon PowerShot 890 IS for a photo from a bridal shower of a friend)The video zoom is great, grainy but better then my 890IS my SLR does not have video which makes me peeved but the fact that it has a digic III processor every photo comes out fantastic.I want to keep this camera because the build is great and it does take web posting worthiness photos when there is good lighting aka indoors in a kitchen but with the lights on and natural light from outside HOWEVER the loss of detail is there on zoom and not suitable for large prints or editing only for \"as is\" shots etc.I am a Canon user/fan for years and upgraded and upgraded from one Canon to the next and after trying theCanon PowerShot Elph 1400 and SD1300 and now this model....I think I am going to have to abandon a brand I loved for over a decade.  I am so sad that despite consistent complaints that canon has not rectified the compression issue.  My 10 megapixel old Canon PowerShot takes better photos then this and the other aforementioned NEW models then there is a problem.  I had my Peterbald sit in his bed in low light conditions using flash and full auto on both this model the 300 and my old model the 890 and the loss of detail on this model was abysmal compared to my 890 using same subject same lighting conditions and same distance and same sd card.So I am back on the hunt for replacement still and every camera that has the digic 4 and regardless of cmos or ccd because they have such a high pixel count the cameras just do not cut the mustard and this issue is I need a point and shoot that has video for when I am taking pictures of my Peterbalds or my baby cousins or anything to have to lug my slr and my video cam (which is a canon btw which is great) is ridiculous.signed really ticked and hoping Canon comes out with something better...:(", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very rough finish to touch", "Author": "Ganesh", "ReviewID": "R3CTM01B4FPUJP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Features wise - this is a very nice camera but when you touch the camera - its not that good.
