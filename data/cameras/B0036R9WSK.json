Soto", "ReviewID": "R3S9TOHH6CFYGB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research on camera's in the price range and this camera offered more features than the others. I really love the camera. It is easy to use and takes nice pictures. I love the video feature and that it has a built in speaker. You must get a memory card because internal memory will only store one photo. There is no shutter delay. It also has different modes to take pictures in. The 5x optical zoom is super clear at any zoom level.Huge lcd screen display and the camera is ultra light. Not that it really matters but I also like the rubber buttons.", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "I LOVE IT!", "Author": "mrsdbrock", "ReviewID": "RR5BU66JBKXJ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the cheapest camera's I've ever gotten and its one of the BEST seriously.

I've adjusted all settings many times in all lighting situations, but the images always seem hazy or slightly out of focus. However, the video capture is nice quality. Overall not bad for a cheap point and shoot to capture quick images. I'll stick with my DSLR for the quality pics.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "WOW!

M. Taylor", "ReviewID": "R2EIHVAILYL9D9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera fairly cheap at a going out of business sale from some online store. I was taking a trip, and my older Kodak digital is a bit bulky. This camera is great for portability, battery life, ease of connection and charging via USB, and it has a nice, large LCD screen. That's about where it stops being great.Unless the lighting is perfect, the pics tend to come out dark. And any slight motion occurring while the picture is being taken results in blurring of those objects (the movement could be subtle and it still shows up). There also appears to be a lot of 'noise' in the pictures, mostly visible in the darker-to-black range. Finally, I find the zoom function to be sloppy. When you press the button to zoom in, it takes a split second to go. It also takes a split second to stop when you release the button. And it is difficult to zoom in at variable speeds. It operates on extremes.When I saw this was 12.2 mp, I was excited. I have since learned that a good camera is not just about the megapixels. For example, my 2005 Kodak 5mp camera takes incredibly crisp and clear pictures. It has a lens on it that is considered higher end (at least compared to this Samsung). I mostly use the Samsung as a quick picture taker when I place items for sale on eBay. Perhaps I should place this camera there as well.I should mention that I only use the default settings as a point-and-shoot camera. I haven't delved into the settings on this thing.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's ok, but a little disappointing..", "Author": "Amberrr", "ReviewID": "R1CDN9XKA1BAAG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like this camera except for 3 things. When you take pictures, if it isn't in direct sunlight, or in REALLY  bright lighting, the pics turn out really dark..so I have to end up turning the night mode on and the pics still look odd. Secondly, a lot of the pictures turn out blurry so you have to keep retaking the shot till you get a decent one. Lastly, the button sucks. You have to press it a few times to get the shot, and usually by then, the \"kodak moment\" is gone. But for the pictures that actually do turn out, they look good. I like the editing options (the b&w; is really intese, love it!) It's ok, but definitely not worth $80..works like a $40 camera IMO. I'm sticking with Kodak from now on, they never disappoint.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "AMAZING PHOTOS AN VIDEOS!", "Author": "khaque6", "ReviewID": "R15YROCWLS0MKB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before buying this camera. I searched and compared nearly every brand and I have to say I that I extremely satisfied by this purchase! The Samsing SL605 is light and durable (I took take it everywhere with me!) and that was something that a traveler like me really needed. The added features really makes this camera a cut above the rest, even considering my last camera (which broke nearly in half the second I dropped it on carpet) was a Nikon Coolpix. The 12.2 megapixels is a terrific deal considering the price. Every picture I took during a concert I went to last night came out in the same quality as a camera priced 5 times more. It takes nearly the same quality pictures as my friend's $900 camera! You're able to capture action in dim lighting and take brilliant videos while still retaining the best picture quality. The only complaint I have is that it takes a while to learn how to properly adjust the features to exactly the right setting, and believe it is totally worth it.  And it's really quite a lovely red color. This is a deal you should not miss out on!", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Camera Great Price", "Author": "D. C.

The scratch protector is a bit cheap, and I hope the lens will take the inevitable beating the little ones in the house are likely to give it over time, but all in all we are quite please.
