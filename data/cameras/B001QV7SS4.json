You can delete unwanted photos from memory. The SD HC memory card can be removed to print selected photos at some stores. If you expect to take many pictures keep extra batteries handy. Batteries too weak for this camera can still be used for flashlights, remote control devices, etc. Always use the top-grade batteries made for digital cameras.
