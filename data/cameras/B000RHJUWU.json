It comes with a rechargable Li-ion battery and charger.  I've had the camera a couple weeks and haven't had to recharge.  I have taken some nice pictures and a few movie clips with good quality.  This camera is easy to use, with the different settings displayed as you turn the dial, so you know what you're getting without trying to remember the visual cues.  Only problem I've had is it takes my computer a lot longer to edit pictures with this many mpix.  Quite a change from my old 2 mpix camera.  I purchased this bundled with a 7\" digital frame for $170 at Best Buy.  I think this camera is an excellent value for the $$.", "Date": "June 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the pricw", "Author": "Michael K.

I know that there is a lot of anti-Kodak bias out there.  I have several digital camera (Nikon D50, Nikon D40, Sony W7, Sony W80, Panasonic DMC-FZ50, Nikon S200 and a few more) and this one holds it own.  Don't get me wrong, it won't match the speed of the DSLR but if you want a simple camera or a basic second camera when you don't want to take your more expensive one, consider this or the similar Kodak M753.", "Date": "November 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera For the Price", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RZGCL9FOG8XL9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great pictures, easy to operate.

My major complaint is that it gets severe red eye. I love how the menu is easy to use and how the camera works overall.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R2YYF2FMF78B1D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have the kodak easyshare c763. It takes ok pictures in the day time with proper lighting. Night shots are horrible. This camera has no optical view finder so it is very hard to see your subjects when there is low light. The differnt shooting features like, party, beach, etc are completely useless. There is no red-eye reduction. I owned this camera for only a year and the external zoom lens gets stuck all the time and won't retract back! This is the second kodak digital camera I have owned withthin the last 3 yrs. I will pay a higher price to get better quality and a better brand next time.", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Kodak EASYSHARE C763 - Digital camera - Great Camera", "Author": "Drum 247", "ReviewID": "R3757VZLOU461T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ive owned this camera for several years.  It takes very good pictures.  Very high definition.It will take more than 1,800 pictures with a 2GB sd card.Im sure there are other digital cameras out with more features, but this one works great for most applications.  Like I said its very high resolution.  Always works great for me.You can also record video with it!  Although I have a Sony Camcorder for that... but you do have the option to record video as well.  Works pretty good as well.  I almost only use mine for taking pictures, and for that it works great.I also purchased two more batteries that came with a charger as well, because I lost my charger in Las Vegas several years back.  Now I have 3 batteries, and a great charger as well.I bought the charger and two batteries here on Amazon for around $9.Great price... yes I know this review is supposed to be for the Kodak EASYSHARE C763 - Digital camera, but FYI, you can also get TWO MORE BATTERIES AND A CHARGER for this camera for under $10 as well!Like I said, it will take more than 1,800 pictures with a 2GB sd card.  Three batteries and 1,800+ pictures to take, you can take pictures all day long!  If I want to get a great picture of a specific scene / thing, Ill take like 30 or more for slightly different angles, then find the best few and delete the rest once Ive downloaded them on my computer.Also, downloading to your computer is EASY, no software required, just insert the SD card into your computers card reader and drag and drop them on to your desktop, or into a folder youve created.easy easy easyI really like my camera, it has never failed me or let me down.  It takes great pictures with no lack of quality.  I am not a pro photographer, but for everything Ive used it for it works GREAT!Two thumbs up!If you can purchase one still, do it, it works great!hope this helps, happy picture taking", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "KODAK CAMERA", "Author": "MEP", "ReviewID": "R3AZ1333ID1BND", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "WHILE THIS LOOKS LIKE A NICE CAMERA AND IT DOES WORK. i AM ASSUMING IT IS WORKING AS WELL AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO. IT TAKES PICTURES TOO SLOWLY FOR ME. I HAVE A NEW BABY AND BY THE TIME CAMERA HAS ACTUALLY CAPTURED THE EVENT, THE BABY HAS MOVED OR CHANGED FACIAL EXPRESSION OR CHANGED WHATEVER HE WAS DOING. FOR ME, IT WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY AND I AM GIVING IT AWAY ALONG WITH ITS PRINTING DOCK THAT BOUGHT. AT LEAST IT DID NOT COST ME THAT MUCH, THEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN PIST", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good for the price, but not without flaws", "Author": "Joe Ellis", "ReviewID": "R1V3JBDNDGAKKT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera two years ago and it's still working just like the day I got it.  It was already pretty inexpensive at the time, and I was just looking for a pretty basic point and shoot that I could bring around to family events because my brother and sister-in-law had just had their first child, the first of a new generation for our family.On the plus side, in addition to the price it is also somewhat compact.  It's not the smallest out there but it's definitely smaller and slimmer than many other cameras I was looking at.  It has plenty of different settings (though I rarely find myself using them) for movement, portraits, etc.  The screen on the back displays very clearly and is of a good size considering the overall size of the camera.  It takes pictures at high resolutions but it's a bit lacking when you see them full size on a computer.  It's at its best when you're taking pictures outside, the times are very few and far between that I have taken a picture outdoors and been disappointed with them in the slightest.  Surprisingly to me, the videos that it takes are of very good quality for a camera in this price range and the microphone picks up on noises and voices very well.  The rechargeable battery and SD card are very easy to get to and are easy to get in and out, though it is far too easy to put the battery back in facing the wrong direction if you're not paying attention.On the negative side, the camera really falls flat when it comes to indoor pictures.  I often find myself not using the flash because of the children (we have several in this age group now) and I don't want to distract them from what they're doing or annoy everyone with flashes every 5 seconds when I'm trying to get pictures of them playing.  Even when the rooms are well lit by natural light, pictures invariably show up a bit blurry or grainy (grain in this instance being akin to the kind of colored fuzz or snow you find in lesser cell phone cameras) and I have taken many pictures which are nice to look at only because of the subject matter.  Even with the flash on, any picture inside seems to end up this way.  It's really odd because videos that I take inside turn out just fine.  If you plan to take a lot of pictures inside, choose a different camera.  It also seems to take its time focusing, if it can even decide where to focus, and when there's any sort of action the pictures come out blurry.  So I have a lot of very blurry pictures of toddlers.  The macro setting is also very poor, even at the closest you can get to an object it will not pick up on details and it will hardly look any different than pictures taken with any other settings.Overall, I am fairly pleased with this camera.  It seems well built, the rechargeable battery functions well and was a huge selling point for me at this price range, and it does take very nice videos and great pictures when outside.  If you're looking for something to carry around with you when you go do outdoor activities I would recommend this camera.  Otherwise, you can probably get something better these days for a similar price.", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Decent", "Author": "parkca01", "ReviewID": "RFVO6DAFF5RVL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So, this camera survived travels, bar trips, being a college student, beaches, and beyond. Its durability is amazing and I could go an entire weekend without charging it once and taking hundreds of pictures.After 2.5 years of owning it, it has started freezing up and become blurry.The low-light/night pictures are useless. It doesn't capture things in motion very well. It has some other quirks that bugged me. I likely wouldn't buy a Kodak again. No zoom on the movie feature but the sound quality on the movies was great (I recorded a song at a concert on it).Flash works great though, and a 2GB memory card would hold 45 minutes of movie or 2000 pictures on it.It's a quality camera for simple use.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Kodak C763 Digital Camera", "Author": "D.

I had previously owned a Kodak EasyShare CX4230, so Iwas in bad need of an upgrade and this little camera hit the spot. I can doso much more with this camera than the old one.

About 85 percent of the pictures I took were blurry.  I have a steady hand.  I took pictures in a variety of lighting conditions, both inside and outside.2) The Kodak software is so buggy!  Argh.  It makes me angry.  I had to uninstall it.3) No view finder.  I knew this going in, but still found it annoying.4) I also got the digital frame in a package deal.  It sucks too! There is no random feature so when you turn it on you have to see the same pictures, in exactly the same order over and over again.Plus, Best Buy charged me 33.00 as an open box fee just to return this junk.

Nice shape product, nice LCD size to preview pictures in the camera, but to slow from one picture to the other, once you take a picture, you have to wait more than in other similar cameras to take the next one.
