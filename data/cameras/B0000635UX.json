I wanted to buy a camera that can work in an easy to use automatic mode for point & click situations like parties, casual travel; and also provides manual mode for experimenting & control. My choice was mainly between Coolpix 2500, Coolpix 995 & Canon Elph Series. I just fell for the cool styling of 2500 and the ability to carry it in my shirt pocket. I just took it out to Australia for a week long trip. It has performed well under different lighting conditions.  All I needed to do was change the \"SCENE\".The camera allows me to identify the type of scene I am going to photograph. It has a bunch of \"SCENE\"  that I can select from. Some of them are - Beach, Landscape, Party, Portrait, Night Landscape, Backlight to name a few. I was also able to take night shots of the Opera house & the Harbor Bridge in the \"night landscape\" mode. They came out pretty well. I was happy to see the result in about 2 seconds - the duration of the exposure. Pictures taken in bright daylight like that on a beach also came of well. What disappointed was the photgraphs that I took at a night Bar-be-Q party. In most photographs, the people close to the camera looked bright and those away by more than 7-8 feet away from the camera looked dark. Another \"scene\" that I found useful was \"Close Up\". I wanted to note down a recepie from a local magazine. Instead of taking notes I just photographed the page in the \"Close Up\" mode. Now, I do not have to write them down ! I just read the recepie off the picture stored on my computer. It is not much of a \"Manual\" camera. So if you want to control everything, I recommend look else where.I found the controls easy to use. There are a bunch of on-screen menu items, buttons & knobs. They are well layed out and are intitutive to use. Let me add - I am a techie. I can handle complexity. I had my first picture in about 10 minutes opening the box and charging the batteries. It took me about 1 hour to understand all the controls & install the software. You got to buy a memory card unless you intend to save your pictures in a very basic picture format (like 640 X??). I bought a 128 MB card. It stores about 140 pictures in best quality mode (called \"FINE\"). The camera can be put on a tripod. That is a big plus for night photography.  It is very easy to put my fingers on the lens. So I have to worry about it all the time, specially while opening or closing the lens. A price for this cool design! In a nutshell I find Nikon Coolpix 2500 a fun, easy to use camera for easy going photography.", "Date": "April 21, 2002"}, {"Title": "Nice Compact Point and Shoot", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3M904WIZVQZ7G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because I needed a point and shoot for an upcoming cruise. I already have a Sony Cybershot DCS-S30 that I am very happy with. I didn't want to bring my Sony on the cruise in fear that the elements (salt air and sand) would ruin it as well as be too awkward to carry around. When I saw this little Nikon it was love at first site. Not only was this camera stylish but its compact and has a lens that can swivel in (perfect for protection from the elements).While I am satisfied with my purchase there are a few drawbacks to this camera. None of the drawbacks are too serious but for a spoiled gadget use such as myself they are inconvenient. I was disappointed that the battery was not pre-charged and I had to wait 2 hours to actually play with my new toy. After the battery was charged and I was putting it in place I noticed that the battery has to actually be removed from the camera to charge it in its charger (again a spoiled issue but still inconvenient). The operations (menus) of the camera are a bit clunky to get used to but I am sure in time I will get used to it. My last gripe would be the amount of time between hitting the shutter release and the time it takes to actually take the picture, its not very quick, actually pretty slow.Enough moaning about the faults, what's so good about this little camera? Well it's little! It comes with some handy software. And it has an incredible lens (should you expect less from Nikon?). My Sony can't touch the quality of this lens. The digital zoom shows minimal amounts of pixalation.If you are looking for a digital point and shoot camera I would definitely recommend this.", "Date": "March 29, 2002"}, {"Title": "Compact and Powerful, a good combination", "Author": "Zolla Michalak", "ReviewID": "R2D1S1HPIGW303", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched several cameras, including the Canon PowerShot and greater and lesser Nikon Coolpix, before deciding on the Coolpix 2500.Things I like about it: 1. The size is great. I carry it in my purse or around my neck at all times. You can't get the shot unless the camera is with you! This is one camera you CAN have with you all the time. The swivel lens helps make it more compact because there are no protruding parts once you close the lens, no lens cap to worry about, and the lens is totally protected. I slide mine in an inexpensive zippered makeup bag and throw the strap around my neck. Wha-la! - instant [inexpensive] camera bag.2. The quality of the pictures is amazing! The resolution is fantastic, much better than I needed or expected. It does a good job in low light situations too, which was something I was looking for.3. Scene modes: These are very useful for someone like me who wants to be creative and get good shots, but doesn't have the time or patience to figure out the correct shutter speed and what-not. I don't have any negatives that are bad enough that I would take the camera back, but just so you know...Things I don't like:1. People have complained that the flash is too bright. For this reason, I usually rely on natural lighting when photographing people. Fortunately, the camera is usually able to handle this. You have to hold it steady because the shutter speed is slower. I'm usually able to get one that is clear if I snap several. The nice thing is that it is digital, so you can see what you are getting, and retake if necessary.2. Buy a 128 MB or at least 64 MB memery card the same day you buy the camera. I have not even messed with the starter card they give you. Way too small.3. This is just an oddity, not really a problem. When you are in close-up mode, the lens is constantly refocusing and/or resetting the lighting, not quite sure. Consequently, it makes a lot of clicking and buzzing sounds. Not so great if you are trying to sneak up on a butterfly or something. Hasn't really bothered me, except that I thought my camera was broken. I decided it wasn't when my replacement camera did the same thing.4. If you can afford it, buy a second battery. It lasts a decent amount of time, but it would be nice to have an extra.So, these are minor problems, with solutions. I'm very pleased with the camera. It's great to have a digital. My photographic skills have improved just by buying this camera because 1. I can take as many pictures as I want, without worrying about wasting film 2. I can re-take until I get the shot. 3. I always have it with me, so I rarely miss that awesome photo-op. 4. It's a Nikon!", "Date": "November 7, 2002"}, {"Title": "Cute little camera", "Author": "DianaMo \"diana_mo\"", "ReviewID": "R2OWQ377DGYCBF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a Coolpix 950 and had the chance to borrow a 2500 over the weekend.  This is a kewl little digital camera!  It does take some reading to understand all of its features, but you can start taking pictures without knowing all that stuff.  Just set it on automatic and shoot away!Features I really liked:Camera lens that could swivel up and down - this is really handy for when you need to photograph something holding the camera over your head.  You can see what you're getting on the monitor while pointing the camera where you want.USB connections!  No need for a card reader.  Woohoo!Small size - its more likely to come with to everyday places - where you might find something very worthy to photograph.  (Note: Nikon should've included a small case with it.  I found most camera cases too large for this camera, but a cloth eyeglass case worked great.  A way to protect the lens would've been nice too.  (Filters are not usable on this camera.)Specialty settings:  Camera offers settings for parties (red eye reduction) copies (I think it was in black in white), close ups and so on.  Battery didn't need to be connected to camera to recharge.  If you purchase a second battery, you can charge one while using the other.  Some camcorders charge the battery only on the camera - which doesn't work well for long events.  I'm glad that Nikon chose the separate charging method.  I haven't found an additional battery for it - so I have no idea what they run.Didn't like:Like most point and shoot cameras, the flash doesn't travel far and the focus in low light rooms where the subject is over 20 feet away is not good.  But that seems to be normal for this kind of camera.Battery/memory cover fell off and was tricky to replace.Lens in likely place for fingerprints - would've preferred a replaceable lens filter for it.Camera comes with a starter compact flash memory card.  Nowhere does it state how much memory is on it.  The package recommends 128mb, but I don't think that's what was included.  My best guess is that it was an 8mb card.  I filled it up the first day I had the camera and then switched to a 64mb that I had available.---------Overall, if I didn't already have a digital camera, I would love to have this one.", "Date": "April 2, 2002"}, {"Title": "A Little Camera That Can", "Author": "David Wright", "ReviewID": "R2DVMHHLBICXSP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the 2500 as a point & shoot for work and light/fast travel, to let my son learn photography without running up a huge film tab, because I've been impressed with a different Coolpix I use at work, because it received special mention in a recent CU test despite not being top rated, and based on consistently strong web review.Let me preface my comments with a recommendation/requirement:  read the manual carefully cover-to-cover, practice to become facile with the many functions, and take the time to understand how each \"scene\" makes the camera behave.  Sometimes the \"scenes\" are useful for more than their intended purpose.  Skip this step and it's just a point & shoot.  Take a few hours to figure it out and you can capture great images in most shooting situations.  Nikon has worked very hard to provide quick access to the full range of functions through a small set of controls.Man, was I in for a surprise after getting this camera!  My aging but beloved SLR gear will get very little use in the future.  We shot several hundred images over the Christmas/New Year break, most of which was spent sightseeing in DC.  Indoors & out.  Day & night.  Museums, fireworks shows, parties, set shots, grab shots, painting with light on street corners at night, riding the Metro, and so on.  The images are sharp, vivid and true to color, and distortion-free.  I can't remember ever coming home from a trip with a better set of images.There have been plenty of thorough reviews of this camera, so I'll just tick off a few things I find special about it:--  IMHO it is the most pocketable/capable digital camera on the market today.  Some are smaller, but they don't have the 2500's capabilities.--  The Best Shot Selector is an amazing and vital feature.  You can capture hassle-free and surprisingly crisp images at night and in flash-prohibited museums.--  The rotating lens is a major plus.  Excellent lens protection with no cap to lose.  The 1.2\" camera thickness (lens stowed) is a lot easier on the pocket than the 1.5\" standard digital camera thickness.  In a crowd?  Tilt the lens 45 degrees down and hold the camera overhead.  Working a camera-shy crowd?  Tilt the lens 45 degrees up and shoot with the camera in your lap.  People think you're scrolling through stored images instead of shooting new ones.  Unlike some previous reviewers, I have no problem deploying the lens and keeping my fingers off it.--  The white adjustment feature is very useful and powerful.  White correction is a common post-shoot task, and a sad one since it sucks color and range out of the image.  The 2500's white adjustment takes care of that.  Add the 2500's exposure control and you can land images that are ready to be printed and framed.No honest review can be gripe-free, so these are mine:--  Yes, there are a limited number of times when a conventional viewfinder would be handy.  IMO those few times wouldn't be worth the added bulk and cost.  Nikon, if you're listening, stick with the current design.--  I would like a faster minimum shutter speed on the \"party/indoor\" scene.  This would lose a little background and make the flash more evident, but would produce many more sharp images.Thanks for reading, if you made it this far.  I highly recommend the Coolpix 2500.  The strongest testimonial might come from my wife, who was shocked at the images when I printed a few test sheets.  She's practically stopping strangers on the street and telling them to buy this camera.", "Date": "January 4, 2003"}, {"Title": "\"I have to admit--I was pleasantly surprised!\"", "Author": "Jerry Parks \"USAToday All-American Teacher; N...", "ReviewID": "R1SQS3XITU835H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This isn't my first digital camera, but I am certainly no expert.To be honest, I bought a Canon S-45, but it was WAY more than I need for school photos of my middle schoolers. I had school funds, so I went to Wal Mart, and got this 2-mega pixel (really cool!) camera for $297.My first impression was that it was tad expensive for a 2 mega pixel, but on school $$$, who cares? My second impression was \"there's no viewfinder!\". But the bright LCD is great (you can increase the brightness too!), and after the initial 'getting used to it', I have never missed the viewfinder!OK--here's the scoop. First the POSITIVES:1. It is small, SLEEK, and ultra-cool style-wise. GREAT here!!!!!2. The images touched up just a bit in photo-editing software, FAR exceeded my expectations for a 2-mega pixel camera! I had them printed at Wal Mart in a half-hour for 30 cents each, and they are BETTER than my 35 mm photos (at 4X6 or smaller in FINE mode).3. The swivel lens is cool and sharp!! (Though I'm not sure how necessary). It does protect the lens, but you WILL smudge it OFTEN!!4. The one touch transfer from camera to computer is easy (can you say EASY?)!5. The lithium battery (in its charger) lasts me all day with no problem!6. The twelve scene modes cover just about any shooting situation you could imagine--as does plain ol' automatic. The close-up mode focuses down to 2 inches--I practiced on a salt packet at McDonalds!!7. Nikon really IS more than just the name. They provide everything you need including the USB cable. I would upgrade the CF card, though, to 64 or 128 MB. A quality camera.8. It comes with an OK manual, and is reasonably easy to learn.And now for the NOT so positives:1. The cool case is sturdy, but will scratch if bumped hard. Not a biggie here.2. The flash washes out the picture when you get TOO close, (forgivable), and is worthless altogether beyond about 10 feet (not forgivable).3. The buttons are a  bit small, so good eyes are required.4. You get no sound in your 15 seconds of 'movie', but this isn\ufffdt great to start with. Get a camcorder!5. The 3x optical zoom is great, but the 4x digital zoom increases the graininess--true in all cameras not just this one.Bottom line:Am I satisfied with this camera at $297 of school $$$? You bet!! It is all any teacher would need, and 60% of the human race too. Would I pay MY $$$ for it? Nope. I'd pay a little more for a 3-4 mega pixel. This camera does everything it is SUPPOSED to, WELL!The pictures are OUTSTANDING!!This is a FUN, cool, QUALITY, and slightly overpriced digital camera, that understanding these attributes, you will enjoy if you buy it!", "Date": "March 30, 2003"}, {"Title": "Best camera for the money", "Author": "\"thepotatocar\"", "ReviewID": "R2N386VVCE7N3K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Nikon Coolpix 2500 is a great camera. It may only be 2 megapixels, but unless you decide to print photos larger than 4x6, maybe even 8x10, then 2 MP is fine. I use this camera for web pictures and just showing pictures on a computer screen, so 2MP is more than enough.The camera comes with 12 scenic modes that you can choose from, or just choose either manual or automatic mode. The 12 scenic modes are for diffrent situations, like snow, indoor/party, portrait, nightscape, night portrait, and (one that still seems strange to me) fireworks. Basically, the scenic modes adjust the camera's setting to adapt it to work better in a certain situation. I find that I use manual the most, cause I like to play with settings. The auto mode works quite well too. The LCD monitor is the only way to take pictures on the camera. Nikon, probably for lack of space and the design of the camera, decided that they wouldn't include a optical viewfinder. What does that mean? It makes it a little harder to take pictures in direct sunlight, but the LCD is still decently visible when compared to other LCDs, like my Nikon Coolpix 990.And now, picture quality. Pictures on average, very good quality. On a computer screen, its difficult to notice the diffrence between my Coolpix 990, which has 3.34 MP, and the Coolpix 2500. I did notice a little \"noise\" when taking a picture in lowlight, especially on wooden color things, on the LCD, but they don't seem to show up in the final print. The optical zoom is very good, and the camera lets you know when you've started using the dreaded \"digital zoom\". The digital zoom produces a horrible amount of noise on the LCD. I recommend avoiding the digital zoom. The size of the camera is one of the best parts of it. Its small enough to fit conviently in a cargo pocket or in the palm of your hand. The size doesn't detract from the feel of the camera though. My hands seem almost perfectly fitted to the camera, even though my hands are on the larger side. The styling of the body also stands out, and makes it prettier to look at then the usual boring camera. When searching for a digital camera, I ended up with two finalists; the Coolpix 2500 and the Digital Elph s200. I chose the Coolpix in the end for a few reasons:Price-The found the Coolpix at a much cheaper price on another website than I could find the ElphCompactness-The Elph is about an inch shorter, but I was more worried about width than length. Styling- I liked the look of the Coolpix more than the Elph.And the final, biggest reason:The swivel lens! This feature took the cake. Swivel lenses make getting shots so much easier, as well as allowing for more creativity. With the Swivel lens, you can shoot in almost any directiong without moving the main body of teh camera. Also, the swivel lens allows the lens to be protected with it is inside the body.The coolpix 2500 is my favorite digital camera of the ones i've tried, including the Elph. Always research for yourself, though, as the best camera for one is the worst camera for another.", "Date": "September 21, 2002"}, {"Title": "Very good but not the best", "Author": "A Customer", "ReviewID": "R3IVNGMG4TYIQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'll get one thing out of the way. I bought this camera mainly because it looked cool. I was shopping for a digital camera in an electronics market (I live in Asia) and was looking for something in the 2.0 megapixel range. I ran across the CoolPix 2500 and the design of it definitely caught my eye. I looked at it for a while, toyed around and decided I wanted to buy it. While it's definitely a good camera, it's not the best. On the whole, I thought this camera was pretty good. One thing that sets the Nikon CoolPix line of cameras apart from everything else is its swivel lens design. This is clever because when you're not using it, it covers the lens. No need to worry about broken lens covers or scratched lenses anymore. Plus it helps getting angled shots much easier. No more craning your neck to get a shot above of below you, just tilt the lens. It's a whole lot more useful than you'd think. The picture quality of this in general is pretty good. The colors come out accurately and the pictures are clear. However, the night exposure could be better, although it's good enough to pass without any qualms. A big problem that's related to night time shots however is red eye. It's always there and it never seems to go away. I managed to minimize it using the different scene settings, but it just never completely leaves. It gets sort of annoying after a while, but it's something most people can live with. Also, the camera tends to feel on the fragile side. Whenever I put it in my pocket, I always feel like it's going to break any second. Of course it's never happened and I realize that it'll take quite a bit to knock it out of commission, but it does have that light easily breakable feeling that I can never seem to shrug off. Some other minor complaints is that there is no video output straight to a TV and there is no optical viewfinder, although the optical viewfinder part isn't really too big of a problem. Also, there is no protection for the LCD screen. Something along the lines of what Sony does with their cameras would have been a good protective measure to take with the screen. With all these negative aspects to it, you would think that I wouldn't like it, but that isn't the case. It still is a good camera and it's a blast to use. The visual quality is still fairly good and has a bunch of nifty features to it, namely the swivel lens. And besides, whenever you pull it out in front of other people and you swing the lens, everyone will go \"ooohhhhhh.\"", "Date": "November 11, 2002"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect for my novice needs", "Author": "Darin Kalpakoff", "ReviewID": "R1FAS4AN95R3PO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a total novice to photography and wanted a camera for web posting and editing fun.  The Coolpix 2500 is almost a perfect 5/5 stars except for a couple minor (very minor) drawbacks.  I have had the camera for 4 days and taken over 300 pics.  All pictures come out great in auto mode and I have experimented with the different scene modes--no problems at all.  The menu is very easy to use, bright and easy to see under most conditions  which brings the first drawback.  Being an lcd screen only without a viewfinder is a problem out in sunlight.  The screen becomes very washed out and difficult to see.  You can make out the general shapes and object positions but details are not identifiable when framing your photo in sunlight.  This as frustrating as it sounds really hasn't bothered me and I have just adapted to it tho there is a \"hood\" for the screen that I will probably give a try.  The battery life seems to last a long time especially since the lcd screen is always on.  I haven't yet needed to buy a second battery but will anyway.  Charging the battery is stated to take about 2 hours but doesn't seem to go over 1 hour for me to get a full charge.  The camera is very small ( like a pack of 100's cigarettes) and lightweight.  Even with my big hands I don't have any problem using all the buttons which are spaced nicely.  Now the second drawback for me--The Nikon 5 software--.  WARNING before you buy just know that the software for downloading from the camera and editing WILL NOT WORK on Windows 98 First Edition.  In small print it says Win 98 SE, Win ME and XP.  It would be nice if they made an attempt to warn you that 1 version of Win 98 works and the other doesn't.  This may not be a problem for most people but since my PC's have all worked fine I opted to bypass 98SE, ME and XP until now.  Well rather than let all the software goto waste I went and upgraded to XP and I'm glad I did.  Downloading from camera to PC is flawless and from there you can upload to the web or start editing with a button click.  The editing software gets a novice 5/5 stars.  It is VERY easy to use and has all of the best tools I could want in a very concise and clean format.  Photoshop 6.0 for example has wayy too many buttons and menus for me to keep track of.  Cheers to Arcsoft for their fine product IMHO.  The camera comes with a 16mb CF card but I opted to get the 128mb because Amazon.com had such a great deal when I bought it.

It's features are also among the best in it's class allowing the user the ability to change most settings. The 16MB starter card is just that, and depending on camera settings will get you a limited number of pictures, but if you plan to take alot of pic's w/out downloading you will need a bigger card.

Hold the camera still until it's done, or it will take blurry pictures.  The slowness also means that you have to anticipate action shots, such as a child in motion, or you'll miss the subject.  (This is true mainly when the subject is within a couple of yards.  It's fine with longshots.)2) The flash unit really does create some nasty red-eye.3) It takes practice to use the swivel lens.  Early on, you might miss some great shots because you're fumbling with it.Despite these problems, I have grown to appreciate the Nikon 2500's simplicity and excellent optics.

It's not quite film quality, but it's fun.  The swivel design, movie mode, and adequate included storage make it easy to capture much more of an event than traditional film cameras. The included 16-meg compactflash card is fairly big, holding anywhere from about 15 to over 200 pictures, depending on the size and compression options which are accessed through an intuitive menu system.The design of the camera is very smooth--when the lens is rotated back into the body, there are no protrusions, making it nice for carrying in a pocket.As others have noted, the lag time before the camera actually takes the picture can be annoying, but choosing the right \"scene\" (a preset of various camera settings) or using a tripod eliminate much of the problem.  The \"Museum\" scene is pretty impressive, and does a good job of capturing vivid colors in indoor situations without the use of the flash.All in all, it's a great camera.  It manages to retain some of the high-end features found in the more expensive Coolpix models--although shutter speed, focus, etc. aren't accessible through menus, there are enough \"scenes\" to cover most situations.  And it's unlikely that the average user would be able to do a better job of adjusting these settings anyway.One thing it's missing is a video out for connection to a TV--which the Sony camera in this price range does have.  But no camera in this price range has the Nikon's quality feel or graceful design.Finally, the included software is great.  I've used the software bundled with Sony products before, and it's just awful.  The software Nikon gives you is unobtrusive--connect the camera via USB or compactflash reader, and a little window pops up, transfers the pictures, and leaves you alone.  Also, a panorama maker takes a collection of pictures and makes great 360 degree views (viewable in QuickTime), as well as APS-like panoramic shots.Pros:-Swivel lens is fun and protects the lens when not in use-Many \"Scenes\" which allow for professional camera settings at the touch of a button-Intuitive menu system-Great softwareCons:-No video out-Small delay before shot is taken", "Date": "July 22, 2002"}, {"Title": "Another rugged Nikon", "Author": "PJB", "ReviewID": "R1QVMF2RW8BA13", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just returned from a trip to Alaska where I took 450 images with a new Nikon Coolpix 2500.

What do I mean?  Well, my number ONE priority was the ongoing search for a compact pocket \"point and shoot\" camera for the least money (of course not compromising quality!) that I can carry anywhere like I carry my cell phone, period.  Since then, that is exactly what happened.  I've used it just about everywhere and anywhere without feeling I had to treat it with \"kid-gloves\" and worry about its well being whenever taking it out for any type of use.  All of you who have owned expensive cameras will appreciate THIS priceless feeling.  It takes great pictures and is LOADED with user-friendly features which at one time or another are all incredibly useful... and best of all?  It remains a pocket camera!If you are the creative and resourceful type, you will notice the swiveling inner zoom lens is useful to capture photos from just about any angle.  In fact, I've used it many times to take a close-up picture of a friend and myself if there is no one to take the photo for you.  Not to mention, you have a timer feature also.  Given the professional field I'm in, I also use it for close ups to capture telephone numbers and names on signs, billboards, and magazine pages with any writing or information on it.ONE negative (or else I would have given it 5 1/2 stars)...the 8 MB CompactFlash card that it comes with...well,... It's useless (for the 15 images it holds at default settings).  Upgrade to at least a 128 MB CompactFlash Memory Card, hence add an approximate [$$]-[$$] to your original purchase price - well worth it.  At default settings (which is GOOD quality) I've taken over 300+ pictures without worrying of running out of film,.. umm, I mean memory, before docking the Coolpix2500 to my PC for download.  Speaking of, once you connect via USB port, in only ONE click, you are downloading your pics...and as for the proprietary lithium-ion rechargeable battery which is included? Very nice.Ironically, I never read any reviews at the time of my purchase in the early part of the year.  In fact, as I later found out it was the first few days the Coolpix 2500 was out on the market.  Therefore for me, it was three and a half-hours of in-store experimenting with ALL the digital cams priced nywhere from [$$$]-[$$$].Therefore unlike many people, the \"cool\" factor never did blur my analysis in arriving to my final decision.

Cheng", "ReviewID": "R1MEJNFQ46R2JX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after reading a multitude of reviews on the internet, and I have to say it's lived up to my expectations.  The first thing you'll notice is its compact size, which means you'll conveniently be able to take it with you anywhere.  Despite it's small size, it's surprisingly easy to hold and use(and I have big hands).The rotating camera lens is as useful as it is innovative.  It enables you to aim your camera without having to compromise your view of the LCD screen on the back.  Speaking of the LCD display, it's very bright and pleasing to look at.Use of the camera is not tricky at all.  I found myself zipping through the various menus and settings with ease after only a few uses.  And I think you'll really appreciate the 12 different scene modes it has to offer (particular \"indoor\", \"close-up\", and \"museum\" mode).  I thought the different modes were just a marketing strategy, but I use them all the time!Despite all this, the most important thing the camera has to offer is its clarity and ability to capture rich colors.  At 2 MP's, it produces pictures that are 1600x1200, which makes great 4x6 photos, and adequate 8x10's.  Since most of us can't print pictures larger than that, there's not much need to spend [money] more for a 3-4 MP camera.  For outdoor photos, the colors and sharpness of the images are outstanding.  Sometimes, pictures taken in dimly-lit settings tend to have more \"noise\" sometimes, so I'm still trying to find the right camera setting to compensate.  But of course, it's always harder to take good pictures in dimly-lit environments, despite what camera you use.Another nice feature is the ability to capture up to 15 seconds of video.  My only gripes:  why the 15 second limit? and why not the ability to capture sound?Finally, the battery:  trust me, you'll appreciate not having to use 4 AA batteries (which drain quickly and add lots of weight to a camera).  The rechargeable battery is small, light, and lasts surprisingly long.  Charging only takes 2 hrs (about the time it takes for me to upload pictures and play around with them anyways!).With all this in mind, I can say that for this price, the camera is a great deal.

I come from a 35mm SLR background (two college photography classes).  I've been waiting for Nikon to create a form factor that utilized much of the features of their higher end cameras, but more compact.  This camera is perfect in that regard, so I made the plunge into digital.I've taken over 1000 photos with this camera and overall I'm very happy with it.  I don't have much to add to what others have posted, but I'll point out what I consider a major design flaw:  the LCD screen used as a viewfinder scratches VERY easily -- in the next iteration of this product, Nikon needs to add a sliding door to protect this LCD panel.  Even with a camera case, this thing will get scuffed up -- I liked to keep my camera at my ready, sometimes in a pocket or nylon bag with other solid objects -- if they rub against the LCD, forget it -- Scuff City.On a positive note, I wanted to point out something a lot of other reviewers have neglected to mention:  the ability to capture motion video in Quicktime format.  If you use digital editing software you can string these together, add a music track and make some cool little movies to post online or email friends and family  Very cool.  Wish the camera could capture sound, but I suppose that's not the market Nikon is addressing with the Coolpix.  It's still a very cool little extra you should explore if you buy this camera.Otherwise,  the menus -- once you've used them for a few days -- are quite intuitive and easy to access.  However, you should play around with the different presets as well as the manual exposure adjustment to get a feel for what kind of results you'll get.  The presets will probably fit most needs, but it's nice to be able to \"open\" and \"close\" the aperture for darker or lighter exposure  (okay, it's a CCD chip, not a mechanical lens and aperture!).One minor interface gripe:  I wish the camera remembered its last settings (like extra sharpening) between powering off and on.POST-SCRIPT JUNE 2005:So several years later I come back and find that I can't stand by what I originally wrote.  I still like the form factor of this camera, but generally agree with what many have said about terrible indoors photos and red-eye: I've tried every setting possible with this camera, but in darker indoor settings  I can NEVER get a clear shot with this camera.  So I'm looking to get a Canon PowerShot probably -- I've tried a friend's and it flat out performs better.

It was lightweight, compact and easily fit in various pockets. When I came home, I found the photos of scenes in the outdoors with decent natural sunlight came out fine. Outdoor night photos results were typical for digital cameras - usually a little blurry (I think this is because the auto exposure keeps the shutter open longer to capture more light, but the tradeoff is blur). I was disappointed by the quality of indoor photos where the Nikon flash was used. I found most of the indoor photos with flash had annoying \"flash spots\" that seem to be a result of unwanted reflections. Another small annoyance was the battery-life - I seem to need to recharge after 200 or so shots.

I think Nikon could have moved the Flash to the part of the case were the red-eye light is and put a small viewfinder on the swivel lense.  I don't really miss the viewfinder now, however.

The shots were sharp and the color was very good... even on runners sprinting over the finish line.  The swivel lense was great for getting shots over the crowd on the sidelines.

Additionally, red-eye is a MAJOR problem with this camera, and the proximity of the flash to the lens creates a series of mysterious light \"bubbles\" on the pictures.The scene selections are nice, but often incorrectly labeled. I find myself using the Backlight setting for pictures that aren't backlight, and the Snow/Beach setting for the pictures that are neither snowy nor at the beach.Also, the LCD is easily scratched, and the small pixel count on it makes your pictures look much nicer than they are. Nothing is more frustrating that snapping a picture, okaying it via the LCD screen, and then finding it to be awful upon uploading. On the topic of the LCD screen, there is no option to turn off the screen because it has no viewfinder, which is a major drain on the battery life on the camera.On the upside, the software the comes with the camera is nice and the swivel lens is handy for getting pictures at angles that you normally would be unable to see.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3J9N9Y19Z3HFG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this as my first digital camera five months ago, largely on the strength of the Amazon reviews.  I intended to use it for routine snapshots. I can't state how well it stacks up against other digital cameras, of which I know nothing.  But I can say I was surprised by deficiencies it has, when compared against my $100 Olympus 35mm film camera.First, the indoor exposure quality is pretty poor.  Its sensitivity reminds me of ASA 100 speed film.  A flash is always required indoors.  The flash is quite anemic: anything 8 feet or more away will be dark.  In photographing a kids' soccer team two rows deep, the front row was slightly overexposed while the rear was underexposed.  The line was about 3 feet deep total.  There is very little exposure latitude with the flash.Second, I have never seen such red eye in my life!  The flash is about 3/4\" from the lens in the same horizontal plane.  I have to spend a couple minutes in Photoshop to clean up every single shot.  I'm used to seeing eyes like this on flash photos of cats, not humans. Third, the battery is tiny, proprietary and very expensive.  This probably explains the weak flash - there's very little power and Nikon needs to preserve it.  Plus, after about 30 seconds idle time, the camera hibernates to save the battery.  One has to press the shutter and wait about 5 seconds for it to revive each time.Fourth, while outdoor exposure has been good, the LED screen is too weakly backlit to view at the beach or ski slope.  And there's no optical viewfinder, so you often can't see what you're photographing in these circumstances.Fifth, one must swivel the lens assembly open in order to use the camera.  When doing this, it's very easy to put a fingerprint over the fixed transparent lens cover.  And a little bit of smudge on that cover gives plenty of artifact on the pictures.Finally, while I shoot at the unit's maximum resolution, it's still not acceptable to press the shutter button and wait two seconds before it takes the shot - and then wait another 3 or 4 seconds for it to be ready for the next. And if the flash is involved, that adds another 2 seconds before the picture is taken. Like I said, I was looking for family snapshots; but far too many pictures have the subject moved out of the frame because of these delays.So, this camera is okay for some things - especially outdoor daylight shots that are not too bright.  But my 35mm performs a lot better in many circumstances.  And its Costco-developed pictures are about 30% the cost of those from a digital camera.  And I don't have to spend hours engineering Photoshop corrections, or burning the images to archival CD.If I had it to do over again, I'd be more fussy about cycle time, battery capacity, flash distance from lens and exposure latitude.

It takes pictures with practically no lag. You press the button it takes the picture. The people who complained about the speed might have been having problems focusing the image.2] Colors come out PerfectSome people mentioned a problem with the colors of the pictures. NOT TRUE. pictures look very realistic and are great quality.these 2 issues were making me very insecure about the purchase. i was afraid this nikon would be a waste of money.

I have been several times and have always just had a regular point and shoot type camera.  At the end of trips I always ended up with things I wished I could have framed better or pictures that weren't quite lit-up enough.  So, I shopped around for a digital camera and my requirements were simple:  something small and discreet, easy to use, and came with easy to understand software.  I was not disappointed when this camera arrived!  It is everything I wanted and more.  One of my favorite features of this camera is that it comes with a rechargable battery and the charger.  Not only does it charge up relatively quickly (60-90 minutes) but it held the charge through 2+ days of pictures for me!  This was a great upgrade for me and in the long run it will save me money because I don't have to develop film any more!  Plus, I can \"discard\" pictures I don't like and take them again before it's too late.

The too-clever signature Coolpix \"twist\" to expose the lens takes just that much longer and is just that much more fiddly than simply removing a lens cap--and one misses too many photos as a result. A sliding cover would have served much better, especially one that also turns the camera on. (The twist doesn't turn the camera on, that's a distinct step.) Controls, menus, and features are generally good, as is the LCD, but the power switch is easy to leave in the wrong state and is poorly constructed. Sadly, the real failing of this camera is its image quality. Maybe I'm comparing apples to oranges, but when I bought this as an easier to carry substitute for my Olympus C-3040Z I was prepared to loose some quality for the sake of convenience. However I was not prepared for the glaring failings I encountered. First off, Nikon compresses its highest quality images more than is necessary. Far worse are the strange washed-out or saturated colors I get with this camera. In side by side comparisons between my two digital cameras, where the Olympus produces striking results, the Nikon's are consistently over-saturated and blurry. I have taken both cameras on several trips, and find myself discarding almost every shot taken with the Nikon, even when I have no equivalent from my Olympus.Overall, a convenience not worth the disappointment.", "Date": "May 6, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great product for everyday use", "Author": "\"cryzjb2002@hotmail.com\"", "ReviewID": "RWBNX5JV2WP31", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera!

Oh, and the video mode on this camera... forget it. Sure it will shoot video, but there is no sound and if you don't have day light and a lot of it, its no good.
