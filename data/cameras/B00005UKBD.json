{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Investment in Digital Photography", "Author": "EgusHdus", "ReviewID": "R1DL25N10T9LYA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Frankly, this IS an investment...you spending $1000+ for this camera plus some needed accessories.  Few people will ever shoot 5 Mega Pixels (MP) shots every time, but serious (and serious amateur) photographers will certainly appreciate being able to produce stunning detail when the need arises.  Look at images shot on your friends' 2 or 3 MP cameras...this level of quality is amazing...but you WILL want to exceed this occasionally, and (...) is the price you pay to get the technology NOW.  A 5 MP head shot will allow you to EASILY discern individual hairs on life-size prints (as in 11x14)...it's truely amazing.I looked at the Minolta Dimage 7...the auto focus zooms past the subject and back...it seems irritatiingly \"loose\", for lack of a better term.  The Sony is a bit crisper in it's approach to auto focus, though not perfect.Low-light shots are a challenge, but the viewfinder does have a tremendous amount of information available, including exposure \"F\" stops, shutter speed, low light warnings, etc.  The true genius is that you can essentially operate the camera in a manual mode, quickly overriding the meter to compensate for the light in any situation...backlight, contrasty light, reflections, etc.If you ever used a 35mm in manual in the old days (when you really had to KNOW photography), you'll love the control available.  And younger photographers will find a whole new world in being able to make this camera do what most digitals will still not do...take the unusual shot.The camera is well balanced, and rather sturdy.  You will get used to the shooting position...give it time.  My biggest complaint is that the zoom selection switch operates \"backwards\" to my taste.  Intuitively, I want to zoom \"in\" pressing the \"out\" button (!)...You have an adequate built-in pop-up flash...PLUS a PC connection for external flash AND a flash shoe!  Slavery, anyone?The memory stick is a bit of a hassle, but extremely convenient once you get over the struggle.  Buy a small USB reader to use at work or home...I use the \"Zio\".  And buy the 128 MB memory stick...nothing smaller.There were early problems with \"White Balance\", as recently as Nov 01.  Current cameras should be shipping with the factory fix, but Sony, to it's shame, STILL has no information on it's website detailing same, even though it required early owners to send the camera for a \"free\" repair.  Not exactly good thinking for a $1000 camera.The images are good, but I do have to compensate a bit in low-light.  Based on shooting several thousand \"test\" shots with another camera, I'm happy with this one.  It does the job and can satisfy both consumer and professional.  Note that I do not plan to replace this camera for several years. Why?  Because printer technology has not caught up to the resolution of the camera (at least for the home user) and no one really needs much more in a camera.  Five Mega Pixels will generate a poster-size image with very nice quality...you won't be doing it often, but you'll be glad you did when you do.I like it, and I shopped hard to ensure the most features with the best price. As with all electronics, find a cheap extended warranty.  (...) .  Cameras DO break.Shop carefully for a CASE to put it in...the unique shape requires some thinking.  I have 3.  One for everything including cords and cables, one for the camera plus memory sticks, and a Sony brand \"ever-ready\" case.  Depends on how long you're out and how fast you want to access the camera..at what level of protection.  Think.You'll want an extra battery.  Perhaps a travel charger, otherwise you charge the battery by plugging the CAMERA in the wall (!)...thanks Sony.  :-(Buy a UV filter (58mm) to protect the lens. This camera is expensive, and generally reliable - it's a Sony.  Many features I have not detailed, and it has a superb 10x OPTICAL zoom (and a 2x digital).  If you are thinking digital and want to not have to trade-up for a while, I suggest the Sony DSC-F707.  If you love photography, do not buy a smaller CCD chip than 5 MP...even if you buy another brand.  But I certainly recommend the Sony DSC-F707 camera for people to whom the image is important.", "Date": "December 6, 2001"}, {"Title": "Best camera on the market", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3NXVAYS0GT4YK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My previous camera was a Sony DSC-505V. An excellent camera. I am agoldsmith and gemcutter and use a digital camera to photgraph my work for use in portfolio and advertising items for sale. It is some of the most difficult photography there is. But with this camera it has become. I am finished with hiring a professional photgrapher.  Most of my work is done in macro mode. The DSC-F707 is incredible in this way. Focus is always perfect. Just as important is true to life color. When photographing gemstones the color must be exact. Big problem with other cameras that I have used. No problem now. White balance and spot metering are much better than expected and the automatic functions are flawless. In the past I would have to take a dozen photos of each item and then pick the best. I get the perfect shot first time almost always with this camera.  The 5 megapixels is a dream come true. I can take a close up photo of a diamond or gemstone, then crop out an inclusion and enlarge it while still keeping a nice, sharp picture. My customers know exactly what they are getting. It is almost like photography through a microscope. I plugged the camera into a 57 inch digital television and enlarged a small diamond inclusion to fill up almost all of the screen and still had a sharp image. That had me convinved.  Of course this camera will be used for vacations and such also. I am a skydiver and travel all around the country looking for fun. Its common to see the small digital camcorders mounted on helmets. They will get kicked and banged around in the air and get hit with wind up to 300 mph. You will rarely see anything but a Sony mounted on a helmet. It is about the only brand that makes a camera that will stand up to the abuse. So Sony is the only choice.  On skydiving trips the fun does not end when the sun goes down. Take lots of photos after dark. The nightframe feature will see lots of use. In low light conditions the LCD screen on digital cameras is usually black and you have no idea what is in the frame. With the nightframe you can set up the shot under night vision then take photo in true color with the flash. Great feature.  The viewfinder is a great feature lacking in the DSC-505V. In bright light the view screens on digital camera become invisible. With the viewfinder it is easy to see what you are photographing.  This camera has every feature and adjustment that I have seen on any 35mm or digital camera. With a good printer the prints surpass anything that a 35mm can do. 35mm just became obsolete. The included 16MB memory stick is useless. Have to get a 128MB. Also bought the optional wide angle lens. Only complaint is that I have not yet been able to find a wide angle converter lens yet.", "Date": "December 11, 2001"}, {"Title": "Best Digital Camera at this Price!", "Author": "E. B.

I looked at the Olympus models, but the DSC-F707 has a better resolution than the E-10.(...) The lens is great, and it takes great pictures in low light situations.There is a problem with the white balance on some of these cameras, but I believe it has been fixed. If you find that you are having problems while taking low light pictures, with a flash, you can get a flash upgrade for the camera from Sony. You may have some trouble getting into customer support, but that is my only issue with Sony.Don't let that stop you from getting this camera. The quality is phenomenal. I am a photographer, and you can't find a better camera for the price. The quality rivals an SLR film camera. I can get a 6.4\" by 8.5\" picture at 300 DPI picture out of the DSC-F707. For Graphic Designers, that is not quite magazine quality, but it's getting close. This camera can be used for a lot of professional work, and I am looking forward to using it in the field.I have one more problem with this camera. The 16mb card that comes with it is useless. You'll have to get a 128mb card if you're going to take pictures at the highest resolution. The 16mb card gives you only 6 pictures!!!! The 128mb card gives you 48 pictures. I have two of them, but will need more if I go on a long hike. It depends on what you use it for. (...) The battery seems to be OK. It doesn't go out as fast as other cameras I've had, but it can always get better. If I were you, I'd get this camera, a 128mb memory stick, and an extra battery. Then, you'll be set. (...)All in all, this is a fantastic camera. Other than a few minor quirks, it will make you very happy until the new model comes out. Buy it!", "Date": "December 16, 2001"}, {"Title": "We Call This Camera \"Big Eye\"", "Author": "Jake \"JakeSpider@hotmail.com\"", "ReviewID": "R39VWFG3NKPYOX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in May of 2002 and found that I can take better pictures with it than I could with a film camera.  It has all the major features of a high quality Nikon SLR that I own and still use for slides.  The Zeiss lens is outstanding and has a big aperture, f2.0, impressive for a digital.  On a vacation to Maui recently, I took over 400 pictures, and there ain't a bad one in the bunch.  Maui continues to be a vibrant memory to me through these pictures.  Because there is so much published about what this camera has and can do, I will offer only a few tips from my 1000 or so picture-taking experience with this camera.  1. Don't try to focus on anything less than 1 meter away.  I had a dickens of a time trying to photograph a small frog one night, with flashlight in one had and camera in the other.  I could get within inches of the rascal, but the camera would not focus even a couple of feet away.  I eventually figured out to go beyond a meter and zoomed in on him and that worked fine.  There is a macro lens mode for anything under 1 foot away, which may have worked if I had thought about it!2. Forget TIFF mode, this takes forever to capture a picture and takes up 15 meg of memory.  The JPEG \"fine\" mode will capture pictures more than adequate to serve 99% of your needs, and you can get hundreds of these on a memory stick.  Now, if you have real need for TIFF, then disregard this comment.3. Get the SONY bag, LCS-FX, made especially for this camera.  You will not regret.  It is a fine and durable leather and the camera fits in there like a hand in glove, and holds and extra stick or two and spare battery.  You will carry the camera with confidence and style in this compact case.  Handy for taking out and putting back in - great for tourists.I got it... because the camera comes with a coupon for Sony extras...The best investment I've made recently.4. Get an extra battery, but don't waste money on a charger.  You can charge your batteries in the camera overnight, and these batteries last a good long time.  This camera's battery life is a true innovation by Sony, unbelievable!5. Don't waste your money on external flashes.  The built in flash has three power settings possible, and is the most powerful flash I've ever had in a camera, even when I've used externals before.  6. Get a few extra 128 MB memory sticks for your trips to Hawaii or the far east.  You will be taking hundreds of pictures, so don't be caught short.7. Get the Sony USB memory stick reader for your computer.  You won't have to keep plugging and unplugging your camera in there.  This is like a little disk drive, and I've found it to be incredibly compatible with my computer.  8. Get Adobe Photoshop Elements to make corrections to your pictures.  You will spend a lot of money and a lot of time to take your pictures.  This little software package will make very good photos into fantastic photos.  Adjust contrast and brighten those darker than desired faces.  Well worth the hundred bucks to underwrite your investment.  9. Learn how to use the Manual, Aperture and Shutter priority modes.  Doing this will allow you to capture sunsets, darker scenes, sporting events, moving objects and anything unusual that automatic mode simply will not do.  10.  Get a UV filter for your lens.  This is just a lens protector as the filter itself does virtually nothing.Forget about other lens attachments such as wide angle or telephoto.  I've got these for my old camcorder and I can tell you that these are just clumsy extras you have to lug around and seldom use.  They also degrade picture quality.In short, this camera still amazes and delights me.  It is an amateur photographers dream.Frankly, I don't understand the whining so many reviewers do about the Sony memory stick.  People need to get over their childish bias towards flash cards and smart media. Who cares what other cameras use if you have a Sony?  Sony's memory stick works just fine, and is a highly reliable and compact medium.  Sony is to digital photography as Disney is to entertainment.  They set the standard, and everybody else just tries to copy, change something simple to be \"different\", and keep up.  My recommendation is for those imitators using flash cards and other gimmicks, to get smart, get on board, and start using the industry standard, Sony memory sticks, like the rest of the world.", "Date": "August 2, 2002"}, {"Title": "Moved up from F505 model to F707", "Author": "B. Schultz \"SAIII\"", "ReviewID": "R2BFOE03ZQXMMD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned a Sony DSC F505 2.1mp camera for past 2 years of which I really liked [which had no viewfinder but the LCD to set up the shot with]. Taken 10,000 + images w/it. Now I have the Sony DSC F707 w/view finder [much nicer to use over LCD]\u2026 Battery life was not that good w/F505, but I have not use up a battery on the F707 model even after 4 hours of shooting [turning it on and off between shots] in temps as low as 0*f/-18*c temps. I bought a 2nd battery, [have not needed it yet] but good idea to have in case you forget or do not have the time to charge the one in camera. The only thing I do dislike about it is the fact you have to charge the battery while it is in camera [F505 had separate charger].  A separate charger is an optional accessory w/F707\u2026 This is a full function camera compared to the F505. It has a lot of new features on it that I'm still learning about\u2026 After having it for 2 weeks now Im glad I bought it, was going to wait and get it next spring. This is an outstanding camera for the money. If you buy it, makes sure to get a few 128mb memory sticks. You will need it if you shot in large format images [on average 2mb+ jpg files]... One of the best things I like about the F505 and F707 is the form-factor, were the lens rotates up/down on the body. Has come in handy many times the past few years w/F505 and they have kept it w/F707 [if you really want a shot close to the ground from ground level or over a fence/people/etc., this camera can do it by using the LCD.  As far as pictures, the F707 takes outstanding image in most lighting. I shot a lot of images w/snow in background, does not seem to effect it in normal mode.

The picture quality rivals even the best consumer 35mm SLRs, the feature set is robust and the zoom lens (optical only) is equivalent to a 28mm to 194mm 35mm SLR lens.  (You can turn the digital zoom off, and I do!)Picture quality is excellent, whether shooting sunsets or portraits.  The color saturation and accuracy are astounding.  The robust feature set gives you as much control as you want -- just like any good 35mm SLR.  Full auto or full manual, with everything in between.  A great feature is the easy to use exposure adjustment just above the shutter trigger.  You can adjust your exposure and see the results of the new settings in the view finder or on the LCD before you even take the picture. Finally, the lens not only has an impressive zoom range (28mm to 194mm is, like, perfect!), but is fast as well, with a maximum aperature of f2.2.  Too often zoom lenses with such a wide range suffer from extreme slowness, even at full aperature.  By contrast, I have been amazed at how well this Carl Zeiss lens does in low light situations.Other features include an array of great focusing systems, including infrared in low light and 'night vision' focus for shooting in the dark; the ability to lock focus on your target when surrounded by competing auto-focus possibilities; the shutter sound that the camera makes (digitally reproduced, of course); the swivel body that allows you to shoot level while holding the camera over your head - and still see your subject on the LCD screen - or shoot from the waist looking down onto the now-tilted-up LCD screen; the various burst modes; the easy-to-use menu system; and so on... All add up to making the F707 a treat for the photo enthusiast.Personally, I wish Sony would have given the F707 more white balance pre-sets and a black and white option rather than the solarization and sepia options the camera offers.  And I find the placement of the zoom buttons on the lens an awkward arrangement; one I have yet to get used to.  But these are minor complaints.In addition to the F707, I also have a Sony VAIO Digital Studio PC with a Memory Stick drive, so using Sony's Memory Stick media is a breeze for me.  I also have a MindStor portable hard drive with Memory Stick adaptor for storing thousands of 5MP photos while in the field.  This way I get by with having only 4 128MB Memory Sticks.  The MindStor has a rechargeable battery so if I'm really cranking the shots I can download the Sticks right in the bush and keep right on shooting.Finally, a word about the battery.  Sony has long been a leader in lithium ion batteries and the InfoLithium line that the F707 uses is the best of their best!  It truly does last longer than other comparably sized Li Ion batteries, and the fuel gauge is a very useful and much appreciated bonus.  I have three batteries and have yet to find myself wishing I had a fourth.For accessories I added the Sony cold-shoe flash (it's connected to the camera by a cord).  It does a nice job of providing easy-to-use bounce flash, and with the offset extension, eliminates red eye naturally, without distracting multiple flashes.  I also use my full range of Cokin filters that I have from my 35mm SLR days.  All I needed to do was buy the correct-size lens ring for the Cokin filter holder.  If you want a camera that gives you all the convenience and flexibility of a high-end digital camera, while at the same time feeling and acting like a 35mm SLR, the Sony F707 is the camera for you.  If you want exceptional picture quality, a quick and precise auto focus system, and exposure control at your fingertips, this is the camera for you.  If you have a thousand bucks to spend on a camera you will love, then buy the Sony F707 and get on with the picture taking!

We started putting all the photos on our website, no need to scan, they were already .jpg images. A few people started visiting the site, and even wrote asking what camera we used.Over the years, we upgraded, more and more people visited our site, and the cameras took larger and larger pictures.The 707 is, at this writing, the top of the Sony line, producing huge 2600 X 1900 (i think) images. The image quality compares favoribly to high speed 35MM film, in large blowups it is still less sharp than 100-speed.The battery is much improved, with longer life, and a new fast charger makes it easy to keep the power ready.Be sure to buy two extra batteries and some memory sticks.

I love this camera.  I am going to list a few shortcomings, but trust me this is what technology should be and while our pair of Nikon 6006s have a few advantages over digital, the ease of use and instant gratification carry the day for the 707.It is slow as the dickens, don't expect to have much luck with action shots, this is the only reason the 717 has my attention.  If you do need to shoot action, hit menu and one of the record modes is \"burst 3\" three rapid shots one after another, you might get lucky that way.The \"A\" and \"S\" settings to enhance depth of field and shutter speed do not seem to give good results.  These days I just put it on the green camera icon, that seems to perform the best.Like many digitals it doesn't work so well in intense light situations, if you are going to shoot in snow or at the beach, think about getting the lens hood and ND filter accessories. It also doesn't score a homerrun on subtle transparent sky light, a muted sunset, or rainbow can be lost.  I was shooting a double rainbow over Nawiliwilli harbor, I could see both, it could only see one of them.I wish the buttons on the side of lens were in a deeper indent, I keep hitting buttons like white balance when I do not mean to.The auto popup flash is really noisy and vigorous and it has caused me to miss a few shots as it slams into place.Moving to some of the really positive features:The macro mode for closeups is a marvel.  Kathy, my wife loves shooting bees on flowers and such and it comes through every time.The way it handles light on water is just spectacular.  It can also handle shooting the sky through trees and similar shots that confound simple cameras.The movable lens, and ability to work with finder or lcd screen really gives you flexability when shooting things taller than you are.  I got a Senators Only parking sign on Parliament Hill Ottawa that was about 8' up by holding the camera above my head and aiming through the lcd.The range of the zoom is all you can ask of a single lens, yes you do lose a bit of resolution at full digital zoom, but it can still nail a seaplane landing in Vancouver harbor and has enough pixels left to print a nice 8.5 x 11.It interfaces with both my Mac 10.2 and Windows XP Pro with no problem in either case.  The XP software is actually a bit more efficient than iPhoto.I will close with some final tips:My wife got me this little nylon Ex Officio bag to tie to the strap.  That is a much more efficient in an active shoot than the memory stick wallet.If the subject moves, as soon as you start framing, teach yourself to push the shutter button half way down, that cuts a lot of the delay out of a shot.Don't buy a memory stick less than 128M, I think my wife's 707 came with a 16M, now *that* is funny.If you have never tried one of these web based photo storage and printers like Amazon.com's photo services or Image station, they are great for situations like shooting a family reunion.  Just send the URL to everyone and they can order all the prints they want.  Remember the days of looking for the negative with picture 5 on roll 9?

Unfortunately (but fortunate in a way), this camera was stolen. I was dissapointed wtih it from the start. The colors were nowhere near as vibrant and clear as the Kodak DC290. I often found outdoor pictures to be yellow saturated and distant objects to be far from clear especially if they are bright like a snow capped mountain. Indoor pictures were terrible, colors were way off and half the time the light sensor did not sense correctly leading to half the pictures being blurry. The optics are also a joke and the menu options far from intuitive. Now the Sony F707, on the other hand, brings back the beautiful clear vibrant pictures of my Kodak DC290 and much more. For starters, the F707 is noticeably more solidly built. The menu system is far more intuitive than the nikon. I didn't have to read any of the manual to start playing around with advanced features. The optics are awesome blowing away the Nikon. Indoor pictures are crisp and clear and can be taken faster than the Nikon which has a terrible lag in low light.

As a high end consumer camera, the DSC-F707 rates at the top.  Given adequate illumination, the 707 will produce very sharp images, capable of being printed up to about 14\" on the long axis.  Of perhaps more utility, one can digitally crop images from the 707, for example tossing out 75% of the image and still enlarge to, say 4 x 6\" and get a very good quality print.The camera has a variety of operating modes (such as shutter priority) to allow the user to optimize the exposure for a specific situation.  Exposure compensation is also available and easy to use.  The optics are made by Zeiss, one of the leaders in professional optics.  The combination of large image size, exposure flexibility and excellent quality of optical elements allows one to bring out finer contrast elements in their photos.  You may think that ~1,000 dollars is pricey, but to go beyond what this camera offers, be prepared to spend quite a bit more.Now, to the minor nits that must be picked.  Like most consumer digital cameras, this model does not provide wide angle capabilities ( I think 38 or 39mm as a 35mm equivalent is the widest).  Sony offers screw-on wide angle and telephoto adapters, but I can't find anyone local that stocks them so I can check them out before purchasing.  In most cases, the screw-on wide angle lenses do not couple well with the camera flash, but I have not evaluated this rig with an adapter yet.  And, about the flash on the 707 - it is a flip-up device that pops up when the camera decides that it needs a flash.  This can be distracting.  Also, realize that working with large images can be tedious.  You need more memory stick capacity, a computer capable of manipulating large images quickly and you need to be able to archive huge quantities of data.  By the way, this camera has some video capability, but I haven't piddled with it enough to know much about it.

I am continually amazed at the picture quality, both in night and day shots.  Just as a primer, I went 10 days straight shooting off around 400mb worth of images per day.  And each day, the lowest my battery ever came was 30 minutes.  At the end of each day, i'd unload the pictures to my laptop and recharge the camera and start all over again the next day.  I intermixed using the LCD display, flash/no flash, etc - and i never worried about the battery power.Honestly, I'm an amateur photographer at best, but the images it produced were amazing - makes you feel much better than you actually are.I even dropped it accidentally, at 3 feet onto concrete and with the exception of a few scratches, it works just like new.It's not all good.  If I had to find some negatives, I'd say, the bulkiness isn't always the best thing.  Having this huge \"L\" shaped camera hanging off your neck can be a bit imposing.  I won't get into that whole propietary argument with the memory sticks - they're afforably priced now and so what if there's five different standards?  The thing with it that I don't like is that 128 mb is the biggest they've got.  At 5mp, at full resolution, it's 51-55 shots max per card.

That's how I felt when I got one of these in my hands. The look and feel is a bit different but becomes very natural very quickly. Don't let that deter you from looking closely at this camera, its output is tremendous and is top rated by almost all reviewers and is on all the recommended lists I've found.For starters, this is my 4th digital camera, my last being the highly rated Kodak DC4800.  What this brings to the party is more pixels (more pixels = higher quality output), a longer optical zoom (digital zoom is practically useless) and low light capability.  Oh, and it also has an unbelievable Carl Ziess-built lens system that is optically superior to most others out there.  Did I mention the quality output? I was extremely happy with my Kodak but this one beats it hands down for any indoor and/or low light scenes.  The color saturation is on the high side (which is what I like anyway) and isn't adjustable in-camera.  There is a sharpness setting and I found this camera likes a +1 setting as the standard setting is just a bit too soft for my tastes. The end output matches the true SLR professional cameras that are out there (digital), and even beats some of the old \"pro\" digitals.But I haven't got to my favorite gain with this camera. Specifically, I've always grieved over digital cameras poor performance in low light. I've tried most every brand out there and found they all lack in this scenario.  Sony addressed this by taking some of their electronic wizardry from their broadcast and consumer video camera world and adapting it for a \"still\" camera. It has Night Shot and Night Framing capability and delivers low digital noise on the final product to boot! This is the answer I've been waiting for!On the downside, EVF's (electronic as opposed to glass view finders) aren't perfect yet. Sony has done a good job here but it still can't fully match SLR capability, except for one exception; it can actually lighten (enhance) detail in very dark scenes that the naked eye can't even see.  It's also a bit hard to store and carry due to the HUGE lens system. Don't get me wrong, for what this camera delivers, I'm willing to adapt to the size and weight. Also, although not difficult to learn what all those buttons do, you'll still need to refer to the owners manual for a while until you memorize all the features.If you're not sure about this camera, my opinion is that if you splurge, you won't be sorry. Yes there are similar and smaller cameras on the market with better memory cards (read larger), but Sony has a real winner here and I'm glad I looked beyond some of Sony's quirkiness with using proprietary batteries and memory!

This camera is easy to use and it takes awesome pictures.  As an amateur photographer, what more could you want in a camera?I extensively researched this purchase and found a great website for you to compare specs.  Check the forums out on this site and find out what owners of various cameras say about their purchases.

If you're comparing the Sony 707 to the Nikon Coolpix or Minolta Dimage you'll get plenty of side by side comparisons at the above site.OK...here's what I love about the Sony DSC F-707.  1) Memory Stick prices have come down and are now comparable to other brands of memory. 2) With 5.0 +/- megapixels YOU have the choice of how detailed you want the resolution.  I use lower resolutions for candid family shots and higher settings for my \"Art-y\" pictures. 3)Many professional photographers are stuck on the Nikon or Canon brand names and don't take the Sony seriously.

Dunlap", "ReviewID": "R14KKRA6K8YSP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm out shopping for a new camcorder and am leaning towards a Sony model. This brought to mind my Sony F707.**ON THE UP SIDE**I bought it in 2001 and paid a lot. I think with all the stuff I got with it, it came to about $1300. Best money I ever spent on an electronic device.First off - if you have this camera or are picking one up, drop $10 on an appropriately sized UV lens attachment. It doesn't really change your pictures, at all (it's a clear lens). What it does do, however, is protect your precious and expensive Zeiss lens underneath. Over the years, my UV lens - in place ALL THE TIME - has saved me from trashing the *REAL* lens multiple times. I've had to replace the UV lens twice - at a cost of 20 more dollars. That, my friends, is a bargain compared to the alternative. The fact that you can attach any number of aftermarket things to the lens (because it is standard sized) is just plain awesome.I got a 128MB stick with the camera. Sounds sort of laughable now, but I've operated that camera at the highest resolution for every picture from day ONE. No problem. It still fits 60 or so pictures. Have a laptop handy with a USB stick reader and you've got plenty of storage.I've taken this camera everywhere. From the Mayan ruins in Mexico to the top of the CN Tower in Toronto - the pictures I have taken as a rank amateur have impressed many people. Most recently, I used it at the Philadelphia Phillies World Series Victory Parade in Philly (DUH!). With the way the camera twists, I was easily able to hold it HIGH up over my head and still get exactly the shot I wanted. People see the pictures and think I was in the front row when, in fact, I was about 5 rows people deep into the crowd. The sea of red hats/shirts contrasted against the buildings in a mixed light environment (buildings/shadows/bright spots) looks awesome.There are LOTS of settings to play with if you want to experiment. Some of my coolest shots where nighttime long-exposure pictures of the illuminated Niagara Falls. And I pulled it off without a tripod on hand (hold camera VERY still...LOL).I take a lot of pictures of my kid's sports activities.  While there is a delay on the initial click-to-picture process, it doesn't take long to get used to.  In any event, I find the built-in \"Burst-3\" mode to be very useful for sports.  I've gotten more sweet shots that way - Bursting \"around\" the moment I want to photograph...outstanding.**ON THE DOWNSIDE**In 2004 or so, I suffered the very common \"loose focus ring\" problem. This was followed in 2005 by the [very related] \"front part of camera falls off\" problem and it \"now rattles inside\" problem (loose screws). It seems there are a few screws that hold that whole mess together on the inside that have a tendency to come loose. Fortunately, at the time, I found a forum on a website that included a posting of the nature of the problem and the steps (step-by-step screenshots/descriptions) to repair it without having to take it to Sony. It is very particular about how it comes apart and (of course) goes back together. If you have the \"loose focus ring problem\" - or the more advanced stage of that, the \"lens falls off front of camera problem\", let me know. I saved it and will send you the repair guide in .PDF format. thedunlapfamilyATcomcastDOTnet.EDIT:  At this time (April 2009), this repair guide to which I just referred is still on the Internet.  Find it here:  [...]BTW - I came to realize the common problem(s) described above are caused by the relatively \"violent\" spring action of the pop-up flash. Over the years after hundreds (thousands?) of \"POP!\"s from the flash, the screws in question get slowly rattled looser and looser.  Finally, they fall out, but stay contained within the camera.Once I performed that repair, though, everything was fine. I used Loctite on the screws so they'll never fall out again.The motion pictures (low quality video) it takes are, especially by 2008 standards, a complete joke - many (most?) cell phones take better video, now. But I found it handy from time to time. Most recently, I used it to have some woman tell me her contact information so I could send her the pictures I had taken. Far easier than writing it down, you know?  The sound, at least, is pretty impressive, considering.**IN THE END**My camera still works like a champ. I see no reason to upgrade until Sony (or somebody else) essentially re-releases the same camera with updated electronic guts. The physical camera, itself, is just about flawless.I'm the first to rip a product if it sucks, so I figured I'd take a moment to praise this item that has been worth every penny.**FINAL WORD**If you can pick up this camera used and in good condition (especially the Zeiss lens), do it. Get that UV lens/filter I told you about. If nothing else, give it to your teenage aspiring photographer. Let their imaginations run wild with all the cool settings - settings that STILL don't exist on 90% of the cameras being put out today.

Some of the great features are the manual controls like focusing and lighting. Another big plus is the Nightframing mode which allows you to use infra red to view and focus on your subject in total darkness and then the flash pops up as you take the picture for a perfect color shot. The Nightshot mode is also pretty neat if you want to take pictures in the dark with infra red like results.Overall this is a great camera with only one negative comment and that being on the red eye reduction feature. Once you press the shutter button you no longer see your subject through the viewfinder/LCD screen because it goes blank for the second or so while the red eye strobing occurs. If you're not careful, this can result in your moving the camera off of the subject during the strobing... or your subject themselves decided to move and you won't know that until after the picture is taken and the viewfinder/LCD picture comes back.I recommend this camera to anyone wanting a great 5M pixel camera at a very reasonable price (compared to others) with exceptional features.", "Date": "November 6, 2002"}, {"Title": "Great features, easy to use, and seamless w/ Mac OSX", "Author": "Mountain Meister \"MtnMeister\"", "ReviewID": "R39JHU1TMD0WLR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a terrific camera - worth the price.

The first was stolen when I was mugged on the steps of the St. Deny Basilica in Paris. I had already fallen in love with the camera by then.

I only use the optical zoom on this camera and I was particularly impressed with the focus that allowed me to zoom into and blow up a small portion of photos I'd already taken with the zoom lens at its maximum length. I also like the feel of the camera. I know that many people rave about pocket-size cameras, but I'm used to a larger SLR and like the heft of this camera. This past spring as we set out on a two month vacation in Spain and Ireland, my F707 failed me. The card reader stopped working and I had to fall back on a pocket-size Nikon. While it did a credible job, I could definitely see the difference in focus and clarity of the photos that came from it as compared to my Sony F707. When we returned to the states, I inquired about having the Sony repaired and found that it was less expensive to purchase a used F707 than to have mine fixed.

Not having been an interested photographer in the past, I think that the above fact speaks volumes for how good the camera is and how cost effective it is over film (this is true for most digital cameras) and how interested it can get you to start photographing. I can vouch for this fact because, a friend who picked up another one of these beauties is doing pretty much the same. This camera has an effective 5 Meg pixels and knows how to use them. The pictures are absolutely razor sharp. This does not mean that you cannot take soft portrait. With a lot of manual settings at your disposal you can get the picture just the way you want it. Now, the lens. Oh! What a lens. This is a lens which if various reviews and friends whose hobby is photography are to be believed would cost atleast 2 to 3 grand to get film SLR equivalents. Think about it! You get an aperture of 2.0 at a 5x zoom at full wide angle. That is a really fast lens. To go with it does extremely well in low light conditions as well! The auto focus is not the fastest but for most shots you do not even notice it. Now the controls, full aperture control (from f/2 to f/8) and full shutter control from 1/1000 sec to 30 secs gives you enough freedom to capture the most unusual shots! White balance options are not as expansive though, you get to choose between 3 auto, outdoor or indoor. If none of these are close enough, you have a one-touch white balance. But this requires that you have a white object exposed to the same light that the object you want to photograph is exposed to. Not always feasible for landscapes in tricky light conditions or for people and portraits outside or in mixed lighting. Even though to be fair, the auto does a pretty good job of calculating white balance. Auto Exposure Lock and a choice of 3 metering modes allow you to adjust exposure to any part of the photo and shoot images with consistent exposure. This is very important if you want to stitch landscapes together. Also, you have the option of either manually focussing if need be. Pretty good versatility.

The F-707 is the first digital camera I've owned and I've been very happy with it. I will say that low-light (for any CCD) can be a challenge, with longer exposure times in low-light needed for good prints, but a tripod solves the problem for stationary subjects. I've taken some long-exposure night photos and have been really impressed with the results: no noise whatsoever!Since I'm certainly not an expert nor a reviewer of electronics in general, I can't tell you how this camera stacks up against the competition. But on its own I've found no glaring shortcomings with it bar one well-reported one, and that is that it exhibits some \"barrel distortion\" when taking pictures at minimum zoom. I also purchased the wide angle conversion lense, which, while bulky, definitely has it's place and has allowed me to take some dramatic photos I'd otherwise have been unable to.Hope this helps.", "Date": "May 19, 2002"}, {"Title": "Super Camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2FA0Q4KGNZQO3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i am very pleased with the results from this camera.

In this respect, the F707 exceeds low-end SLRs like the Olympus E-10, and is only matched by digital cameras costing over $3000.My only criticism is that the F707 looks and feels more like a digital consumer device than a professional camera. So far, I have been working with a Canon-A1, a traditional film camera. The A1, manufactured over 20 years ago, is a testament to the legendary craftsmanship with which professional film cameras are built. By contrast, Sony designed the F707 like a digital toy. The camera has little girth, and the annoying, obtuse LCD viewfinder makes one yearn for an SLR. When you're holding the F707, you feel like a yuppie with a palm-sized camcorder, not someone well-versed in photography.These are but trifles, though.
