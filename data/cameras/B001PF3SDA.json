{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Aaron Frankel", "ReviewID": "R1DHDSXILDBS31", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have tried a bunch of network cameras and unfortuantely most don't work very well Macintosh. Under $400 most don't work that great period. The Axis cameras on the other hand do. The web interface was pretty straight forward. Setup was a little technical, but easy enough.Few of really great things about this camera if you are using a Mac. First, they automatically show up in the Bonjour menu of Safari so locating them and administrating them over the network is easy. Second, Quicktime automatically finds them through Bonjour too!!! You can actually very the video streams straight from Quicktime. Go to File/Open Url/ then click on the menu button to the far right of the screen that pops up and towards the bottom of the list you will see the camera(s) list themselves. You can also change the name that appears in Bonjour lists from a IPv4 address to a recognizable name by going into the web admin of the camera System Options/Network/Bonjour and renaming the camera in the field called \"Friendly Name\" and hitting save.Now for the bad. The password set up does not work over just a few characters. This took me several tries of setting up the password (10 characters) and then not being able to get in to the camera and having to do a factory reset (small button on the back of the camera. Unplug the power. Hold the small button on the back. Continue holding it for 20 seconds as the camera powers back up. Once done the green LED on the front turns amber. Goes green again when process is complete.) I finally just put in a three character password and called it a day rather than pushing for a good one of any length. Fortunately this is something the could easily be corrected in the firmware and probably will be in the future.All in all the cameras benefits WAY outweigh the short comings. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good network camera in the price range whether you are looking for compatibility with Mac or PC.", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera - worth the money", "Author": "Paul O'Hanlon \"mac81\"", "ReviewID": "R11CYG916A8AHF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an iMac, and I wanted to find a quality camera that would play nice with my Mac.I spent - a lot - of time online looking at different cameras before I bought this.First thing: The CD that comes with the camera is for PCs.Okay, so, if you have a Mac, look at the manual that comes with the camera.Then, unless you are a wizard at networking, call the support line at axis.They are very, very helpful. That is part of where you get the value for the cost of the camera.I called them twice, first to help set up the wired side of the camera, and then, two weeks later, to help set up the wireless side.Each time, they were polite and helpful. They actually know something about networking in Macs, which is great, since I never set up anything wireless on a mac before.I am using the built-in Airport card on my iMac to create a wireless network. I do not have a wireless router or Airport base station.Now I have my camera set up, and am using securityspy as my software. The quality of the video is very good, if you have enough light.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good in very low light but...", "Author": "Fifty One \"Thought Out\"", "ReviewID": "R3DKVWZFN1DORX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good in very low light but does drop to 6 frames per second and grainy, however the competitors show completely black video and are useless.

I have owned Toshiba, DLink, Cisco, IBM, Phillips and more, but Axis is the best brand by far! I like the quality, ease of use, programability and setup of the camera I have bought form them. I own 4 Axis cameras currently (3 were sold off when I bought new models) and I JUST ordered a 2nd of this one on Amazon and hope to have it soon! Just cannot go wrong with AXIS", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "apharc", "ReviewID": "R1L0CC5QGVF3V4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for basic home surveillance. I was very impressed with the camera. Quality of the images is great for 640X480 and the sensor is better on movement and other cameras such as (hoo-too $70 cams). You can make out movement fairly good under normal light conditions. Low light conditions might be problematic if you need to pick up movement and unfortunately this camera doesn't have PIR (infrared sensor). You would have to get a different model such as M1034 for PIR, which is a very nice feature.Setup Software - Fairly technical, which I feel is a needed. Allows you to adjust your camera settings based on your environment and reduces a lot of noise/blur and adjust to a nice clear image.Overall, if you have enough light, this is really a great camera and I would recommend it. Axis cameras seem to be well-built.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Meh.", "Author": "Jerald Barker", "ReviewID": "R2LWM010I151KC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is OK for the price.At a distance of 25 feet, I can recognize someone if I know them real well but you'd never be able to pick someone out of a lineup based on the grainy result.I actually have two M1011-Ws,  one wired and one wireless.  The wired may work slightly better, but they both seem to do OK.  The one problem I am having lots of issues with is dropouts.  In a 5 minute period, there are probably 20 or so dropouts where the picture goes black for a few seconds.  Not optimal.At night, these are totally worthless.  I have a street light in my front yard and still can't make out anything except a pair of headlights as they pass by.  In closer ranges 10-15 feet, I can make out blurry shapes of objects in a dark room as long as a computer screen or equivalent is going.  Without that, nothing.So if you need something for daytime and you don't need HD quality, this camera is okay.  It's one of the few in this price range that are wireless, so that is a plus.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice lil Wireless IP Camera", "Author": "Johnny \"Johnny\"", "ReviewID": "R2ABYN1Y44IN3W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "just plug her into your router with cat5, connect to it's IP address from your web browser to configure it if needed, or at minimum just enter your wifi password so you can unplug it from the Ethernet and set it up in any room of your house fed via wifi and powered by a small power plug.640 x 480 max resolution.

I have quite a bit of wireless experience and tools to troubleshoot with and was unable to resolve the huge amount of frame drops and retries.  I'm testing using cisco 1252 and 3500 APs, and cannot resolve a greater than 30% packet loss situation.  I'm sure its something specific to our deployment, but I just don't have the time to waste on this cheap thing.  My need is only temporary, but I had to resort to deploying an even cheaper Foscam.  At least it works.On a better note, the wired video quality is superb.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent daylight picture.  Wireless drops more frames than it should", "Author": "electriccafe", "ReviewID": "R2NLDYTUYOU9QY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm very impressed with what they have squeezed into this unit.. in a tiny form factor it is a virtual mini-computer running its video server software.  Extremely configurable and very good daylight picture.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have a robust connection over wireless.  I'm extremely familiar with wireless networking and can only attribute this to the camera, possibly due to its tiny internal antenna.  Because of this we do lose a couple of frames here and there, sometimes enough to miss a person walking by.", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Bad. Just bad.", "Author": "J.

This thing requires a degree in computer science to set up, however, but the reason for that is the unlimited control that the interface offers!  If you can think of it, this thing can do it!  You can set different motion sensor boxes/sensitivity and have them programmed to work at different times of day, making different sensitivities possible for night/day.  And lots of other features the other guys haven't thought about.  If you're not computer/network saavy, you may need help to set up.

The live viewing of the video worked well, however the motion detection feature that has the ability to email you images when motion is detected did not work.
