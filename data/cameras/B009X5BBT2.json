{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good For the Price", "Author": "William A. Smyly", "ReviewID": "R3O4WXVV5WNZGM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "SHORT VERSION:Working Pocket Camera for a low price, I would recommend this camera (especially if you are looking for a cheap digital camera). I would not purchase this camera to take on your honeymoon or a spring break adventure. It is not waterproof and doesn't seem very durable compared to other pocket cameras.Still the camera works great.LONG VERSION:I've owned around 30 digital cameras from all different brands including: Nikon, Canon, Sony , Panasonic, Konica-Minolta. I use the Canon rebel series cameras the most, but like to have a pocket camera from time to time. I have stuck with mostly Canon cameras over the last 7 years. Nothing against any other company, I just have liked using Cannon. I take daily photographs for a children's summer camp for 11 weeks out of the year. I'm rough on cameras and usually get around 3 years or less out of most of my Canon Rebel Series cameras... but that is not what I am reviewing today....I haven't bought a Sony camera in about 7 years or so - the last one was a Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-H5, which is 7.2 Mega pixel camera and not really a true pocket camera due to it's size....Sony Cybershot DSC-H5 7.2MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilization ZoomAnyway, I wasn't expecting much from this lightning deal camera, but for the price I decided to give it a try. I've only played around with this for a day, so I may update this review later on. (If I don't, assume I'm still pleased with this camera)FIRST IMPRESSION:When I first held the DSC-W670 I thought I had gotten what I paid for in a cheap camera. The plastic seems a little thinner than most cameras and it didn't feel very solid. When you press on the case you can hear the plastic \"creak\" as it bends and flexes. (Not saying this is flimsy - just slightly less solid than most) So I don't know how well this will hold up, given my track record of being rough on cameras.WHAT IS SO GREAT ABOUT POCKET CAMERAS?The one thing that can make or break a pocket camera is all the \"bells & whistles\" Some of these cameras have come up with cool gimmicks and even some useful tools so that any \"idiot\" can get some great shots.I played around with a few of the features of the DSC-W670 I haven't really used much before on a pocket camera. The 1st was the panorama picture setting - this feature has been out for a while on a lot of the pocket cams and is a cool gimmick. I guess I won't have to use the auto-stitch feature in Photoshop as much now.... The panorama setting works well on the DSC-W670. There are 3 settings: 360 degree photo, wide (which seems to be a little over 180 degrees) and standard panorama (which seems to be a little greater than 90 to 100 degrees).To take a panoramic photo, just toggle the camera to that setting using a 3 position switch on the side - use the menu button to select the size and then follow the on screen instructions to show you how to sweep your camera to the right. It tells you when to stop...The other feature that I thought was cool, that I had not used before, was the `Smile Shutter\" option. To activate this setting while in normal photo mode, press the button with the smiley face. The camera places a box around any detected faces. When the subject smiles, you will see a meter bar fill up on the left side of the LCD screen, and when the bar reaches the set level the camera automatically takes a photo for you (You never have to press any buttons). The default level is mid range and the subject needs to show some teeth in the smile to activate the camera to take the picture. So if you are trying to use this on someone who gives you a half smile, you will need to adjust the settings or be good at telling jokes....This feature is a true gimmick feature - I don't know that I would actually use this feature a lot myself. We did test it as an alternative to using a timer for group shots. It took a few tries to get it to go off, but it did work.Everyone was laughing at me as we tested this. I said, \"Ok everyone, come over here and don't smile at the camera, I want to get a group shot.\" Once everyone was set finally I said, \"One, two, three ... SMILE\" and we waited and nothing happened... \"Ok try again, normal faces everyone... ok now 1,2,3 Smile!\" The camera snapped a photo on that attempt.I remember every Christmas growing up, we got a great shot of my uncle walking to get in the picture and was caught by the timer going off before he was set in place.... Might give this a try this year. I have a large family and this feature seems to work better when a little closer to the subject and when fewer people are in the frame... So I'm not going to expect too much, but if it works I'll come back and let you know.ONE PROBLEM:The only problem I have had with this camera is in the door to the battery and memory card compartment. It is spring-loaded like most of these cameras and has a lock that you slide to allow the door to open. In order to open my camera's battery compartment, I have to move the switch to the open position and then tap the camera in my palm to get the door to swing open. I think it is designed to open automatically, yet mine gets hung up almost every time. I've only had it pop open (like it should) a handful of times while testing it. There is nothing to grip to pull the door open, you just have to tap and shake it until it opens. I might just have a defective door. It was a cheap camera and I can live with this, so I'm not going to waste any time calling customer service or returning the camera. Although, this leads me to believe that the door may be the first thing to break on this camera. (remember, I said I'm rough on cameras...)The battery has it's own lock inside the compartment, so it isn't pushing against the door like some of the other pocket cameras I've had. (Which I think is a good thing!) If you've bought and used several pocket cameras over the last few years, I'm sure you've had at least one with a battery door issue. I've got another camera that has the battery compartment held closed with a piece of duct tape.FINAL THOUGHT:A good pocket camera for the price. I wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised at how well this camera works. Sometimes when a deal is too good to be true, there is a reason. I think this camera is truly a good deal. It is not as good as any of the $200+ pocket cameras, but I would have still been satisfied with this camera if I had paid as much as $140 for it.If you are thinking about buying one of these cameras and you have any question or things you want me to test out first - just let me know and I'll try to help.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Photos from this little baby!", "Author": "Reads on Planes", "ReviewID": "R3SAQGZQ7EE2XM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera specifically to replace an old one and in anticipation of an international trip that would take us out of the country for three weeks ..... thru Greece, Turkey and Cyprus.  Yes, very historical and photo worthy places!  This was the ONLY camera we used and we shot over 800 photos.  All but two were perfect - and the two that weren't were not the fault of the camera but of the operators......The battery held up well - we charged it only once a day and only with heavy use.  The videos also came out well - better if you have a tripod but there is decent stabilization built in.  Get extra memory cards if you want to take a lot of photos (over 1000) and can't download and reformat between shootings.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not the greatest...not the worst", "Author": "Lynn", "ReviewID": "RY4Z2HU799DEA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm not a camera geek & prefer to use point & shoot cameras. I've been using my daughter's Cybershot DSC-W50, but she'll be moving out soon so I decided to purchase this Cybershot for myself. It was a $79 lightning deal. So for the price point this is a good camera.I haven't printed any photos yet, but have added them to my laptop & the web. The LCD screen is grainy & bothers me, but the photos have been okay. The flash seems to be overly bright, but does a great job of taking pics in a low light area. Most of my early pics were taken at night with low lighting. (update-I just discovered that the LCD screen is grainy because it's the default setting which saves battery life. To change Disp. Resolution, choose MENU, scroll to the Toolbox icon)A few settings are easy to access, many more are accessed by using the menu button & scrolling through the various options.Several memory cards can be used. Here's a list of the ones that will take still images, as well as, video:Memory Stick PRO Duo Mark2Memory Stick PRO-HG DuoMemory Stick Micro (M2) Mark2each of these need to be Class 4 or faster: SD memory card, SDHC memory card, microSD memory card, & microSDHC memory cardThere is approx. 56MB on internal memoryThere is an on-screen help manual.This camera does not have the Carl Zeiss lens.I uploaded a few photos that were taken in low light situations using the automatic setting.I purchased the Case Logic DCB-302 Compact  Case for Camera - Black which has room for the camera, USB cord, battery & extra memory card.  One thing I've noticed is that my camera has turned on a couple times while in this case. I searched for a hard case, but wanted more room so I decided on this one.Battery life doesn't seem to be as good as my daughter's Cybershot. I haven't used my camera much and fully charged it after I took the first few pics - the battery appears to be down by 1/2 already.I will update my review when I try the Panorama feature & as I continue to use the camera.UPDATE:Macro seems to be part of the auto setting. From what I can tell, it can't be set manually. I did a little research on macro and learned that the minimum distance macro kicks in will vary by camera. The auto macro setting for this camera is designated by a flower icon & doesn't appear when I think it should & it blinks off easily. I have to experiment with minimum distance until the flower icon shows up. This frustrates me.  Remember I'm not a camera geek so maybe it's user error on my part.I also want to mention that this camera seems to take longer to focus than I'm used to.And, finally, I suggest that you purchase at least one spare battery because the battery doesn't hold its charge very long.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheap Camera", "Author": "JamesB", "ReviewID": "R3EB77QX6L62X6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "You get what you pay for!

The camera wouldn't even power on.  I tested it the night before, and the battery showed half charge, so i just let it go thinking it would be enough.So, after the hike, i tried to charge it up.  With the battery in the wall charger, the light kept blinking orange.  After finessing it for awhile, i finally got it to stay lit (which means it's charging)I put the battery back in the camera and tried a few still shots.  It would only take about every 5th time i pressed the button.  I tried video mode, when i hit the record button, the camera would cycle like it was doing something, then the screen would just go black and power down without retracting the lens.  I'd have to power it back on, then power it off to get the lens to close.A little disappointed, i've never had problems with sony items before.

I did not want to give him mine nor did I want to spend too much money.  This one seemed like a good deal for $80.  This camera has features found on more expensive cameras.  Its compact size makes it easy to carry around.  The ability to take pictures as well as HD video, in most cases, eliminates the need to also carry a video camera. The camera has several shooting modes to select from; however, he mainly leaves it in Auto mode to let the camera figure out the best settings.  The Sweep Panorama mode is cool, you press the shutter button and sweep the camera from left to right of vice verse and the camera creates a panoramic picture; he uses this to take close up pictures of the board in his classes. Overall, pictures are clear with good color.  The image stabilization helps take sharper photos; I found this especially useful when zooming.  This is a good day to day camera for around town.  It also makes a nice gift as someones first camera.  As for a camera to take on vacation eliminating the need to take an additional video camera, I would look for one with minimum 16 optical zoom and a 1080P HD video(CMOS).", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Buy!", "Author": "Betty E.
