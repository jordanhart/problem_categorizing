{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love the Lumix lineup!", "Author": "Brian Kerecz", "ReviewID": "R1JZBDADB9G7ZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera last year, and returned it because it did not have a Leica lens, which I wanted. However, after a family member bought a Lumix camera sans Leica lens, I was a convert. For the money, you simply cannot beat it!What makes this camera special for the price is the 6x optical zoom (up to 24X in conjunction with the digital zoom, though that causes degradation), and the Mega-OIS, or more precisely Optical Image Stabilization. This feature adjusts the camera to compensate for imperceptible hand shakes which occur inevitably on every push of the button. I believe that in the future, all cameras will have this function as it is the single most common cause of blurred photos. I have a Panasonic LC80 with a Leica lens, but one of the reasons I went looking for another camera was the blurred photos I got, even though I was as steady as I could be. I cannot overstate the importance of this feature.The burst mode is a very nice aspect of this camera too, one mode allowing sequential shots until the entire card is filled. There is absolutely no excuse not to \"get that shot\" with this camera.Also nice is the ability to use AA batteries instead of proprietary batteries which cost $60 or more.  A power supply which can be easily replenished is a necessity if you plan on being out of touch with civilization for any length of time.If you want a \"Con\" to go with the \"Pros\" it would have to be battery life....battery life is very low and even  moreso in colder weather. But this should come as no surprise as this camera does not use a viewfinder; instead it uses a 2 inch LCD screen to compose pictures. Because of this, battery life will necessarily be much lower than with a camera which uses a viewfinder for composition.Batterly life per manual under normal conditions:Panasonic Oxyride: 250 pictures or 125 minutesAlkaline batteries: 155 pictures or 77 minutesNi-MH batteries: 400 pictures or 200 minutesWhen the temperature is 32F:Panasonic Oxyride: 45 pictures or 22 minutesAlkaline batteries: 35 pictures or 17 minutesNi-MH batteries: 360 pictures or 180 minutesOne other thing I would change is the On/Off switch....it can too easily be hit sideways which would open it in the case. If this happens, it could all too easily damage the motor of the zoom lens.  To obviate this potential danger, simply keep the dial mode at \"play\" when the camera is off, and the lens will not open.And it should be noted that this camera does NOT have a microphone for recording in video mode;  if this is what you want look at the DMC-LZ5.  Because I did not plan on using this feature very often, it did not present an issue for me.For picture taking, this is a 5 star camera. For design, there are a few possible improvements which give it 4 stars.4 1/2 stars overall.", "Date": "May 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Overall great camera that takes beautiful photos!", "Author": "M.

Sherman", "ReviewID": "RH18J2UZMG1C8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been playing with this camera for about a month.  My previous camera was an Olympus Camedia 720, which I decided to replace because of its frustratingly slow lag time between shots and its expensive CR-V3 batteries (it was a battery hog).The LZ3 is much faster (even has a 3- or 5-shot burst mode). In good light, without the flash, lag time has been barely noticeable.  And it uses less expensive rechargeable AA batteries.Another poster, Brian Kerecz on May 3, 2006, has a good analysis of battery usage.This is my first camera without an eyepiece; it only has an LCD screen.Two problems with the lack of an eyepiece:1) I wear reading glasses.  With an eyepiece, there's no problem focusing on the subject; however, with an LCD screen, you'll need to put on your reading glasses.2)On a bright sunny day out in the open (on a veranda overlooking a field), there was so much glare on the LCD screen that I could barely see the subject.  To work around this, I'm buying a \"Delkin 2.0\" Universal Pop-Up Shade\", and I'll update this post after I've used it.**UPDATE**The pop-up shade helps a little bit, but I really miss having an old-fashion optical viewfinder.The camera itself fits into cargo pants pockets.  The controls and LCD screen menus are easy to follow.  And being able to hold the camera up high, using the 'high angle' feature on the lcd screen, allowed me to get some pretty good photos at crowded family gatherings.**2nd Update, 1/25/07**I'm giving this camera to a family member and looking for one with a viewfinder.  It's become way too inconvenient, especially while skiing or hiking or at parties, to put on my reading glasses every time I want to snap a shot.Also (and this may apply to all digital cameras with a \"movie\" function), I love the movie function, but I couldn't adjust the zoom during the movie shot. This was a problem with I started a shot of my son skiing towards me down a hill, and as he got closer I couldn't pull the shot back, so by the end all that filled the screen was his smile.

It was more than I asked for when I walked into the store.I bought an Olympus D-460 for $450 a long time ago. 1.3 MP & 3x optical zoom. Then I bought this, a 5MP 6x optical zoom *with stabilization* for a quarter of the cost of the other one.I went in looking for a 5MP w/3x optical zoom and removable storage with the expectation of dropping $200. I did...but I also walked out with a 1GB SD card and an in-store repair plan. I've had enough experience with digital cameras to know that some type of plan is a virtual necessity.No, this is not a high end camera, nor does it pretend to be. But if you want something with decent resolution, with a bunch of presets, yet still allows you to customize your own shot, then this is your camera.I've been snapping pictures ever since I got home with it...taking some really difficult shots...the TV...the computer. Stuff in a dark closet.

We have also not seen a single blurry photo due to the image stabilization.It also takes wonderful pictures in low light situations.What a buy for such a great price!!!!", "Date": "August 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Alicia Johnston", "ReviewID": "RH2RWGLT1ZB3J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally bought this camera because of my job, now I use it for almost all of my picture taking. I have a 35mm canon rebel G EOS but I was always running to have film developed. I bought this camera so that I could get my pictures easier (and cheaper).It is a really easy camera to use. Mostly point and shoot, but it does allow you to control many options.We do a lot of horticultural diagnostics at work and are always getting calls to come out and figure out what is wrong with a plant or id an insect, plant etc. In macro mode this camera takes the best pictures of insects and small items. Our diagnostic clinic has been able to id mushrooms and diseases from this camera's pictures (which says a lot for this camera's quality).The size of the camera is awesome. It's small and lightweight and can fit in a purse or pocket. I was able to go out into an extremely muddy horse pasture yesterday to do diagnostic work and I was able to not worry about my camera because it was tucked away safely in my pocket. This is not something I could have done with my 35mm.I also use this camera outside of work. It does really well in low light. I have been able to take pictures in a dark auditorium during a choir concert without the flash on and the pictures come out great. It takes great landscape pictures.The software to download the pictures into the computer is really easy to use. Its set up to automatically download the photos as soon as you plug it into the USB port using the cable that comes with the camera. No special docks required.  The only drawbacks to it are:  1- you really need a SD card to supplement storage. Without it you can only store 4-7 pictures.  2- I also recommend getting rechargeable batteries. These have saved me numerous times because you can tend to go through the batteries pretty fast when you use it as much as I do.  Overall I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "January 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "My new camera", "Author": "Amanda Deuel", "ReviewID": "R3PIBA9M5W1K3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since I have only had this camera for a month, I'm still learning how we fit together, but I'll review the best I can! There are a few cons that I'd like to point out first.-The flash sometimes works funny. It'll make the picture weird colors if I let it do automatic sometimes. And then I'll take it off completely so that I can get a better picture, and it's too dark, or poorly lit. So I'm reading the manual again to find out if there is a way to fix that, but so far I haven't.-The on/off switch is very easy to slide over so if you aren't very careful when putting the camera in it's case, it will slide to on and waste battery power. I wish that it had a button instead of a switch, but oh well.-Lastly is the batteries. I loved the batteries that it came with. They lasted a whole week of constant picture taking (I was on vacation) and viewing. But I can't find them anywhere. So I have been using duracell and energizer AA's, and they work, but the camera goes into power saver mode all the time and so the screen turns off in the middle of setting up for a picture. It gets annoying. I'm going to try the rechargable ones next since I can't find the kind it came with and hope that it solves this problem. Well, it's not really a problem per say, but an annoyance for sure.Overall, so far I love this camera and the things that it is capabale of doing. One suggestion would be to get a screen protector. Where some camera's have the screen that is sunken in some, this one kind of sticks out. So it will get easily scratched if not looked well after, and then sometimes it will anyways.

Fujifilm has a model that seems to beat out the Panasonic in reviews, for roughly $240 (after rebate).  I didn't want to wait on a rebate, especially when I found the Panasonic new for approximately $156, with free shipping.  I also preferred the idea of using standard rechargeable AA batteries, compared to a proprietary battery that would be expensive to replace. As of of this writing I recommend that you either spend a little extra money on the popularly reviewed Fujifilm, or else go with this Panasonic.  This is an excellent entry level digital camera in terms of image resolution and battery life, as long as you don't expect miracles under low light conditions.  For approximately $20 more you can also find a small two battery charger, and a 1.0 GB SD card that comes with a portable USB card reader.  With shipping and a pack of rechargeable AA batteries bought locally all of it should come in right aound $190, depending on the retailer that you use.  You don't absolutely need the card reader to transfer photos, but it helps to save the batteries, and also lets you use the SD card as a flash drive for other data.  Windows XP doesn't need any of the included software to fetch the pictures off of the camera, or off of a card reader.  The movie mode is effectively useless because it drains the batteries within seconds, but I didn't buy it for shooting video.  The color LCD display has a relatively low resolution (compared to the Fuji), but it isn't anything that affects the final image quality.  Battery life for outside shots without flash is impressive, and pretty good with flash.  Cycle time between shots is a much better than some of the cheaper competition.  A fitted case would've been nice.  Panasonic makes hard and soft cases for this model but they aren't included.

There are alot of features to play around with and that can be overwhelming to some people.I like all the features, I find them fun to see which way to get the best picture; the food setting actually takes great pictures under fluorescent lights :) As for blurry pictures, the image stabilizer works great and we have only gotten blurred pics if someone moved after i hit the shutter button, and i didn't have a setting selected that accounts for that (like high sens).The shipping was great; Amazon gave us an accurate delivery date, it was in December even and I think it was even early if i'm recalling correctly :) I can't really comment on the battery life because we use rechargeable batteries, and they are kinda screwy.The other digital camera we used was a kodak easy share 650 and it cost about double and gets about half the results.  We got more blurry pictures, the resolution was lower, and I could go on and on as to how much I dislike the kodak one, but suffice to say the one we bought is much easier to use and to work with (downloading, settings, etc)This camera is also very durable, we have 3 kids and it has been dropped a few times with out its case, still kicking and didn't miss a beat :) I'm very happy with this camera, and feel i got my money's worth.

Easy to learn, can take very good photos in well-lighted areas but you DO need to use the flash for dimmer environments - its low-light capabilities are horrible. Very fast readiness time from the moment you switch on the camera - slow to recharge from a flash, though, and there's a bit of a lag when you press the shutter button to when the photo is actually taken (not so great for fast action shots, even though it touts a \"sports\" mode). However, its focusing at full zoom is extremely poor, and it does not benefit in the slightest from the image stabilization - I've ruined more shots than I care to mention because it's impossible to hold steady enough (even when braced). Also, its photos have an extreme amount of grain in the shadow areas under slightly unfavorable lighting conditions (in the shadows of leaves on a bright sunny day, for example), and it does not capture an acceptable amount of detail for a camera that takes five-megapixel photos. Having spent some considerable amount of time with this camera now, if I could reduce the amount of stars I first gave it I certainly would.

If it was still working I'd give it a higher rating. It took good pictures, was fairly small for a 6x optical zoom camera (by early 2005 standards). The different modes were good, though red-eye was a bit of an issue (though I suppose that's going to be an issue with most small form-factor cameras).I would have preferred to have an optical view finder and audio playback of videos on the camera (the camera video mode DOES record audio - but when you playback on the camera, you can't hear the audio) - not a huge deal.I won't be buying another one of these to replace the broken one. We're going to keep our Canon A60 as our primary camera, then probably look into buying a newer Canon when our A60 breaks or we need two cameras again.", "Date": "October 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ3S 5MP Digital Camera", "Author": "Lynn R.
