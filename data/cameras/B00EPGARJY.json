[the accessories are a bonus, but frankly, i really didn't need a small tri-pod or carry case.]  everyone who sees my pictures, LOVE what it can do.  in fact, at least 2 friends bought the same camera via amazon because of the amazing price and quality!", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great deal!", "Author": "simone", "ReviewID": "R2GFFUR8CHAIC4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love that this comes with so many accessories because buying those individually would be more expensive and a pain. I like the wifi option and I use that fairly frequently. Setup is fairly painless. I did encounter one thing I didn't understand with the setup so I called the customer service and the guy was helpful and solved the problem quickly.This is easy to use and small enough that I can take it with me all the time in case I happen to encounter something I want to capture. I think this would be a great gift.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC low light camera!", "Author": "jamie", "ReviewID": "R31NX1FROHYP89", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because the other ones I have do horrible in a low light, indoor setting.  No matter how steady I would get my camera(s) without the flash, I would get a blurry photo every time.  I just had a baby and all his pictures turned out fuzzy!  I did my research and was surprised to see how well this camera was rated especially at this low price.  The second I received my amazon package in the mail, I ripped open the box to check it out.  First off, I love how small it is.  It fits in my purse or pocket, no problem.  It's lightweight but doesn't feel cheap.  I took a few pictures in my somewhat dim lit living room and they turned out phenomenal!  Crystal clear photo, true color, just fantastic.  I played with the zoom (which is not really a feature I care about since I'll be primarily taking up close pictures with this camera) and it even impressed me.  My other cameras were far more expensive than this one, but the quality of the low light photo can't be beat.  In the bright sunlight, it washes people out a little bit, but that's not what I bought this camera for.  The other features are of no importance to me.  Didn't check out the software or the Wi-Fi, so I can't give any review over that.  It's a good basic camera, definitely worth the purchase.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Really great camera", "Author": "I.M. \"Hiroak\"", "ReviewID": "R31442XCS5BY81", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this package because it was cheaper than just getting the camera alone.  The camera is great it does everything I want it to and more.  There is really only one con about the camera that's the wifi is a bit hard to get working but Youtube help with that.  The rest of the stuff is OK I guess we already have so much camera stuff that my kid just ran away with it all.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Met my expectations!", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R3HNFIE2NKCQCS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the whole bundle!! Thought the Memory card would suck, cuz it's really not a brand, but it works perfectly. Took about 100 pics and Five 5 min videos and it worked perfectly, clear picture. Just as i was expecting!!I consider an amature photographer, but I have my moments, this camera works wonders! clear picture, great Stabilization, and i found that adjusting the ISO setting to 700, made everything seem so vivid!Would definitely recommend this product", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice camera", "Author": "Jay J.

Better balance on depth of field. Flash/natural lighting settings are superior.All-in-all, a nice value.

Perfect to tuck in my purse to capture moments on the go. I used to have a larger camera so this feels very small in my hand. Almost awkward but its size is good for taking places instead of lugging a larger one around. I am more likely to use it. Shots have been pretty clear a couple were blurry but i think it was a user error. I havent read the manual but havent been easily able to figure out wifi everything else was instinctive.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12.1 MP DIGIC 5 CMOS Sensor\n10x Optical Zoom 24mm Wide-Angle lens\nSmart AUTO, Intelligent IS, and 1080p Full HD video recording\nHigh Speed AF and High-Speed Burst up to 6.2 frames\nNew ECO Mode to reduce power consumption", "Name": "Canon PowerShot ELPH 330 HS 12.1 MP Wi-Fi Enabled CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom 24mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full HD Video (Black) + 8GB Memory Card + Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514ggFJivkL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EPGARJY"}}
