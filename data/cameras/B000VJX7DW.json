{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incredible color, tone, highlights/shadow rendition: this Nikon is best of breed!", "Author": "Scooter \"SRD\"", "ReviewID": "R35ZMUOTC2BREU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since 2006 I have owned a D200 for serious shooting situations and I got a D40 in early '07 for everyday shots (an awesome camera - I give it SIX stars! - a whole separate review is needed!), and after hearing about the D300 release in late 2007 I debated over whether to get one.  I was really happy with my D200, which I took on some overseas trips and it performed perfectly.  After demo-ing a D300 in stores and reading some online reviews, I decided to take the plunge.  It was a big investment but now I have no regrets - if not for the entire package, then for one thing: COLOR!  Or one more thing: what Nikon calls 'Active D-Lighting' (translation: a significant change in the processor's realistic rendition of contrast, highlights, shadows, etc. - the entire package of \"TONE\").  Also - can an LCD rear-screen get any better than this??  In Jim Cramer-parlance I have to say that this model is definitely \"best of breed\".Pluses and minuses: (note: edited every once in a while since I've used it for almost 6 months now and thousands of captures - last edit was done on 4/9/08)PLUSES:- Incredibly vivid, pleasingly, really surprisingly saturated color reminiscent of Velvia (high-saturation Fuji film used in slides, etc.) is now made possible by selecting the \"Vivid\" option in the \"Picture Control\" menu and cranking up the \"Saturation\" option - there are three levels beyond the default \"0\" - which sets it just about at the highest possible saturation that could be set in the D200.  Even boring photos of things around the home, outside, etc. seem interesting and... well, exciting and vivid... with it set at +2 or +3 (although the +3 setting is a bit extreme for people photos, and renders their skin color a bit more intense than appears naturally).  At the +3 setting even blase photos of ordinary things approach purposely-understated \"art\" in a MoMA-like way.  For people I am finding Vivid+1 or Vivid+2 a bit more natural indoors with natural light, as the Vivid+3 saturates just a bit more than I prefer.  Just like Velvia, these settings also do not warm the cool colors - one of the minuses of other cameras' 'vivid' settings - this is what's best (your cool blues, greys, greens, etc. stay cool, while the reds, yellows, oranges, bright blues/greens/etc. - watch out!)  (Edited note: after about 3,000 shots I saw that indoors it might be best to do a manual white balance preset off a white wall or carpet or something and then shoot in vivid mode, since in the automatic WB mode the reds tend to get boosted quite a bit under typical indoor light and some of my subjects looked like they had a very dark suntan, or even a sunburn, in the middle of December!  Careful with this... also tried standard - i.e. not vivid - color settings with +1 or +2 saturation, and these were very realistic, although the backgrounds can be dull if you're intent on vivid colors all-around.  Maybe best to use those on portraits only.  Try them all out and see what works best.)- On-board so-called \"Active D-Lighting\" renders shadows and highlights in an very realistic manner, with no raising up of delicate shadow tones to mid-levels (as my outstanding, near-perfect-in-its-class Nikon D40 tends to do) - this really must be seen to be believed.  Coupled with the color quality (and deep saturation noted above), the detail in the highlights is excellent.  The D40/D200 have this feature in post-capture (i.e. you adjust the captured image yourself) but this seemed rather crude; here it is said that the Nikon actually computes the needed adjustment and does it specifically for the scene you've captured.  No more blown or off-color highlights in those 'rare' occasions when overexposure seeps into a shot in a very contrasty frame.- The new LCD screen is 3\" in size and has a whopping 920,000 pixels (versus 230,000 for the D200, D80, D40, etc.) of resolution - which means image review to check focus, color, etc. is impossibly accurate and well beyond the already very high quality of Nikon's 2.5 inch screens and way, way beyond that of the Canons with the greenish-greyish-tinted LCDs even on expensive models like the much-venerated full-frame 5D.  Doesn't even come with a LCD protector cover like the D200 did because it's made with tempered glass and is super resistant to scratching, damage, etc.  No more looking through plastic - however transparent - when reviewing shots or setting colors, lighting, etc.  (Kind of always bothered me, that.)- 100% coverage viewfinder - excellent, and not cluttered up, making composition cleaner; nothing engraved in the viewfinder to get in the way (although you can optionally set the horizon-level grid to be on all the time, which I do, since it leaves an open space in the middle anyway, and those off-balance shots are a pain to fix).- 51-points of autofocus available - at first I didn't really care much as I tend to do the old-school method of using one point for focus, then recomposing - but I started using the 51-point AF mode (the full-rectange setting that uses all sensors) and found that I don't need to do this as the D300 always seems to pick the object I wanted to focus on - making things much, much easier - although for really unusual shots with a subject in focus and others way out of focus, I move to the manual mode; the AF system is excellent in speed and accurate tracking of the object of focus as well (i.e. a running child, etc.)  The 51 points make this very easy to do.  Fiddling around in the store I saw on the big $5k D3 the points are better looking (little red spots) and less intrusive when composing than these large-ish black rectangles on the D300, but I can live with that (although it reminds me \"hey, you don't have a D3!...\").- There were issues about firmware and exposure on the D40, D80, where they tended to expose too brightly, and we had to set it manually to -0.3 or -0.7 to get back to normal exposure.  Not on the D300.  Perfect all-around.  Still, adjusting WB and exposure can make or break the shot.  Especially nice is the cloudy or 'shadow' setting for indoor shots in bright sunlight; everything looks pleasingly warm, even if just a tinge more than natural.  Give it a try if you like warm colors.  Interesting shots can be had using 'tungsten' outside in the snow - a blue-grey monochromatic world.  (If you have snow, that is.)  Manual WB setting is easy off of a wall, or carpet, or napkin, etc. as usual with the Nikons in this range, and makes quite a bit of difference in odd-lighting situations (i.e. very dim room, etc.) where the automatic presets, although excellent, don't work well (especially that 'tungsten' - in normal home incandescent lighting in the evening everything is medium-blued-out - who uses this?  Or am I using it incorrectly?  I set WB in that situation off the wall or rug.)- other than the full-frame sensor (no small difference, that is) and high FPS, there appears, from what I am reading, to be no major differences (unless you're a sports or news shooter) from the highly-lauded D3, which costs 3x what the D300 costs; the D3's awesome high ISO performance can be mimicked by turning off the high ISO noise reduction set \"on\" in the default mode in the D300 (see below)  Of course, the D3 has many other features that make it best for pro sports shooters, etc. who need that size and power, and of course, full-frame has no comparison - but I have a bag full of DX lenses (and some non-DX primes) and not ready to put out $10k+ for a D3 plus a 14-24, the new 24-70 and the 70-200, etc. that I'd want.  The differences in picture quality due to the full-frame sensor (and other features I wouldn't need as I don't shoot sports or news) are outweighed by the cost involved and the marginal nature of the difference overall.  Image quality is essentially the same - except for the pluses of the full-frame, especially noticeable in really big prints.  Also the usual full-frame focal length versus DX issue remains alive here - yes, that \"35mm on a DX is equivalent to a...\" continues, and probably will as long as DX lenses remain in our bags.  Edit: I have tried the D3 for a shooting session and it does focus incredibly fast, much faster than the D300 in some cases.  The speed of the focusing and the shutter itself are unbelievable; that camera is the Ferrari or Lamborghini of Nikons.  The D300 may be the Porsche - hey, not a bad compromise - it's unlikely that the average pro-sumer will need the power of the D3 (or of a Ferrari - ever try to do 140mph on the NJ Turnpike?).These were my big main pluses which justified the transition from the D200, but there are a few more which don't really appeal to me but will for some:- Live View (you can see the image on the LCD screen) - perhaps this might appeal to a tripod-user setting up a photo, but I doubt I'll ever use it.  Smacks of \"point-and-shoot\", I think, but could be handy in some cases where it is hard to position the eye at the viewfinder (behind the sofa?...)  (Edited note: should not have panned this - gave the camera to my 21 year old niece, who tried to take a Christmas portrait of my family and I together - and got half of us in the bottom of the frame, and an empty top half of the frame! - for those who basically grew up using live view digital cameras, this feature is very useful - just set it and let them shoot - I think the weight of the D300 and the fact that she had to use a (gasp!) viewfinder (as opposed to the RAZR internal cellphone camera) threw her off.  Some creative cropping may save the shot, anyway.)- Ultrasonic Sensor Cleaner - like the Canons and Pentaxes, Sonys, etc., Nikon finally offers a sensor cleaner (which is user-operated, not constantly running at each power-up if you set it that way).  Might be useful after hard shooting in dusty or otherwise camera-unfriendly environments, but I never had the need for it on any camera I ever had up to now.  Just one more thing to possibly go wrong someday?- HDMI output (if you're lucky enough to have one of those big-screen HDTVs and want to show your photos to all on the screen; I don't and won't)- 12MP versus 10MP (for the D200) - great marketing material but MP beyond 6-8MP or so has only marginal effect on the quality of the image and doesn't really matter ultimately since all it does it highlight the limitations of the lenses or the technique of the shooter; I suppose it is nice to have that much more information recorded ultimately if you choose (via the size/compression settings) but I shoot with \"large normal\" JPG and don't want 10MB+ file sizes when I'm making 5x7 or 8X10 prints at most (or way, way more MB for RAW files) - I am reminded by a post/commentor that the higher MP will be beneficial when cropping a photo considerably for printing - good point - if you're taking 25% of that shot and cropping it, printing it out to 8x10, those 12MP will keep your image nice and sharp even at such extreme crops (provided, of course, you're using the big filesize settings and have lots of storage space in the form of CF cards, hard disk space, etc.)  I don't do a lot of cropping and prefer to create in-camera since I have practically no time to fiddle with Photoshop and the rest.- the new grip (sold separately, of course) that goes with it doesn't stick far up into the camera, so you can use the camera's battery as well as those in the grip as well, and decide which to drain first, etc.  With the grip you get more FPS for action photography but I don't do much of that, and for me the grip makes the whole package too big to fit in my current Lowepro bag (trivial but hey, it's one more thing).- if you've had any Nikon DSLR before, especially a D200, you will feel immediately at home, with no ramp-up period; you don't even need to open the sealed manual, since the new features are so easily located and adjusted that all you do is adjust your settings and start shooting; what won't feel immediately familiar is the super-bold color you'll notice on the intricately detailed 3\" LCD.  Of course, ergonomics are nearly perfect; this camera is like a brick wrapped watertight in rough-textured rubber, perfect to grip and hold for long periods of time.- Capture NX software is included - get this - free! - in a selected number of initial sales of the D300.  It's panned by some but, if you don't have another software package, it's not a bad thing to get a reasonably pro-quality image software package for free.  The easy-to-use three-point pinpoint adjustment tool is excellent.  Edit update - there is a Mac Leopard (OS 10.5) version now available - yeah! - so all computing formats are supported.MINUSES- Quite a bit more expensive than the D200 - naturally, since it's a new model, but is it worth it? - for me it was for the top two reasons; for others, the D200 (or the D80, or the D40) will be way more camera than is enough - also still appears to be hard to get at the right price initially; some supply issues reminiscent of the D200 were being seen but appear to have levelled off; now it's hard, I hear, to get the D3.- When I initially got it I thought that for some reason the highest ISO settings (i.e. 6,400) seemed to lead to somewhat hazier shots, likely due to high ISO noise reduction that is set ON to 'Normal' in the factory default - but who shoots up to ISO 6,400 anyway, unless you're shooting hand-held at faster shutter speeds in very dark environments?  I had my D200 set for maximum 1,600 in Auto ISO and that was always more than enough.  You can always turn the high ISO noise reduction completely off (or set it to low for just a touch of clean-up) and get back to the D200's, and close to the D3's, level of quality.  I did this and had no more issues that initially concerned me, but a side-by-side comparison of a very magnified crop might yield otherwise.  The ISO settings are also odd in that there is no stated ISO 100 but the camera does have ISO options which Nikon calls various degrees of \"LO\", confusingly; just need to learn the terminology and adapt.  High ISO noise is also really only visible, however, if you make 3-foot-wide prints, mural-size images or crop and magnify on your computer screen to unrealistic levels and look really, really closely.  You won't even notice on a 5X7 or 8X10, or bigger, print in normal circumstances.  The fact that there is Auto ISO at all (versus not having it in the Canons) makes shooting a breeze; no fiddling around with ISO settings when you're trying to capture an image.  (Edited note: lots of high ISO shots without NR on have been excellent throughout the holidays, including plenty of dark, candlelit tables, Christmas trees with onboard lights only on, outdoor shots of decor, etc.  Not sure how noisy these would look blown up to big poster or mural-sized prints but for 8X10 or less, I am sure these are perfectly fine.)- Wish the flip-up flash would have a rotating bulb enclosure which you could point upward and get a bounce-flash for indoor people photographs; fairly sure no other DLSRs have this but it would eliminate me having to (buy first and) carry around a Speedlight for indoor shots (i.e. Christmas present-opening by the tree in low light, etc.) lest I get the white-ghost effect of direct flash from the onboard unit.  I rarely use the onboard flash except for fill-flash outdoors, so it is somewhat less useful than I would like.  Then again, Nikon needs to sell Speedlights, so... the SB-600 is a perfect match.  The SB-400 is also a nice one if you're not doing shots with far-off subjects, and it fits nicely on the D40 as well.- I don't know if it's my imagination but it feels like the two spinning dials (on the front and back, for setting aperture, shutter speed, etc.) are a bit more recessed into the camera body than those on the D200; when I spin them I get memories of cheap 1970s electronics when I would push a button, and it would wind up moving itself inside the radio (or whatever) and getting stuck in there - I sampled other demos on the store floor and they felt the same as mine - maybe this is to prevent accidental movement when shooting?  It's as if they are not at exact 90 degree angles to the camera body.  Nice feel on the fingers, but I get memories of those \"stuck buttons\" when I use them sometimes.- it probably would be nice to be able to stuff a CF card and an SD card in the camera for memory options; I prefer CF cards for their durability, but dislike having to invest in two types of cards - CF and SD - for the D300 and the D40, respectively.  Don't know who could possibly shoot so much to fill a full 8GB card (maybe if you shoot RAW+JPG, etc. for sports) but a two-card capacity would also be nice just to know it's there.- It's still not full-frame - I know, it's not supposed to be, and most DSLRs aren't, but I might have paid another $500 (maybe $750?) if they'd made it full-frame.  However, that means another $5Gs+ on 2 or 3 aforementioned full-frame wide-zooms (and effectively making obsolete my big 12-24mm wide, awesomely versatile 18-200mm, and sharp 70-300mm DX VRs) so probably better for the wallet that it's not.- No PC button: The new D3 pro version only available to select press members (the D3P, they're calling it) has a \"PC\" button for \"Picture Control\" - that is, you can quickly switch between your own custom settings you set up in the menu for different picture parameters - say, for landscapes, a high-saturation setting (i.e. \"Vivid\" with saturation cranked up), and for people, a medium-color setting (\"Normal\" with moderate saturation), etc. - but on the D300 (and the normal D3, for that matter) you have to fiddle around with the menu.  A button to be able to switch between picture settings would be a godsend for this camera; otherwise you might miss a shot switching from, say, a high-saturation, white-balance adjusted setting for a beach landscape, then trying to quickly capture your kids on that same beach - which would give them instant sunburns (on the image!) due to the oversaturation and WB adjustment - unless you go pressing buttons to get into the menus (with the sandy fingers) and fiddle around, making the change.  I believe Canons have a button dedicated to this, which makes me wonder why Nikon isn't thinking ahead and, in typical Japanese fashion, copying the best ideas and features from its competitors.Other than these few minor (for me) minuses, this camera's new color capabilities, wildly improved highlight-renditioning and other features more than justified my investment in it.  I'm getting great captures from it.  Naturally a lot of that is subjective - best to try it out yourself and judge before taking the plunge.  One look at the images, the LCD, and the other features, and this one might be the one that makes all the Canon owners squirm in their chairs and wonder what to do with all those expensive \"white lenses\" now that they will want this Nikon!  (Not that I myself wouldn't mind having a 5D and a few of those white-bodied Canon L-series teles, of course!...)Disclaimer: for quick shots around the house of my kids, etc., I still grab my D40 - soon to have a new 18-55mm VR lens shortly shipping from Nikon! - and capture away - it's got to be the best camera in its class, and the images rival the D300 under normal conditions.  It's when things get a little complex (low light, action, the saturated colors, high ISO situations, etc.) that the D300 excels.  Especially the saturated colors!  Never seen anything like this in a DSLR and I've had 'em all (Nikons) or tried 'em all (Canon, Pentax, Sony, Olympus...).", "Date": "November 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "The camera I waited for", "Author": "Tom Iancu \"from east\"", "ReviewID": "R2EX4XM4NLVNPK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Until recently I had a D80 and I also wrote a review about it. So I think it would be useful for you, D80 owners and D300 prospect buyers, to have some clues about what this D300 is about from a former D80 user. I will update my review as I'll be getting into more and more of this camera.First noticeable difference is the size. The D300 is bigger and heavier than the D80, but the size it is not a problem for mid-sized hands like mine are. About weight: I bought a neoprene strap some time ago for my D80. I use it also on the D300. The strap which is included with the camera is a bit too rough for my skin and the weight of camera can be a real pain if you carry it on too long. Any neoprene strap will do, just choose one which is a bit more elastic and has a smooth internal layer (touch it, it is important to do that BEFORE you buy it).You won't notice any important difference in the feeling of the grip size, although it is a bit bulkier, because the body has been reshaped in the back of the camera so it is easy to hold it even with one hand. On the back, there is a handy AF-ON button which is completely in the reach of your thumb and the AE-L/ AF-L button is not far from it either. The body has a rubbery feel which is different than the D80 (more plastic) and lays comfortable in your hands giving you the sensation of a good grip.Controls: One thing that annoys most photographers is to have to lower the camera from their eyes very often when they change some settings. You will not have a mode dial, like in D80, just a button and only 4 modes that will be displayed in the viewfinder; this is a pro camera, the amateur-like modes (portrait, night etc) are gone. It will be very nice for you to know that you don't have to change white balance, ISO and picture quality settings by looking at the back of the camera (like on the D80) to find the buttons. They are on the top, like on D200, which I think it is very convenient because they are arranged in a triangle shape and you can get to your needed button without removing the camera from your eye, because you will remember quite quickly the location of each button: front the quality, left the white balance, right the ISO. Moreover, ISO setting is displayed in the viewfinder and you'll be quite amazed to find how useful this little feature is ! On the D80 I had to use and push the custom function button to see this or to look on top, on the LCD display. On top right are only two buttons: to the left is the mode, to the right is the exposure compensation (use this with caution with matrix metering). Voila, with four buttons you control the most important settings for taking pictures, and, best of all, you know their location without having to look at them. What needs special attention is the release mode dial, is the one you have to look at when changing modes. The rest of lever controls have only three positions so it's very easy to know which one position is which.The build quality is outstanding, it looks and feels like a tank. Remember that, with camera, you are getting an environmental sealing which is not the case for the D80/40/40x. Combine that with a sealed lens like the 17-55DX f/2.8 and you'll gone have a very nice combo even in bad weather. Is that important ? Yes, it is. Otherwise you have to take care all the time and protect your camera from water drops, dust and snowflakes. The sound of the shutter is softer (more silent) than on the D80, probably because of some other materials were used for building the mirror holder and the shutter.ISO, noise: The noise at high ISO is outstanding. When I purchased the D80 I found myself very often wanting to shoot in lowlight conditions and I got a  Nikon SB800 for that. However, using flash to some extent annoys people and high ISO was mandatory in such situations. Now you can use ISO 3200 with 100% confidence and getting low noise, well-detailed photos with good saturated colors will be a rule. ISO 1600 is almost noise free, you can see it at pixel peeping but for prints it is non-existent. More important than low noise is detail preservation at high ISO. The 2 more megapixels also help. What helps most on the field is the Auto ISO feature, something that I have never used on the D80. I took shots using a minimum shutter speed of 1/50 s and ISO as high as 2000. That gives you a very wide range of exposure options without being afraid of noise and lost details. One advice, though: be sure to set high ISO noise reduction to low or none (in the menus). You can always remove any noise with a software but never can recover lost details. For noise removal I strongly recommend Nik Software Dfine 2.0 plugin for Adobe Photoshop or Imagenomics Noiseware. In my opinion, the ISO 3200 is a blessing. That means you can take photos in rooms lit with 60W light bulbs without having to cry for blotchy images. If on the D80 ISO 3200 was good (in my opinion) for 6x4 prints and black and white larger images, with D300 you can go far beyond that. Image quality wise, ISO 6400 on the D300 is almost on par with ISO 1600 on the D80, and, more important, using a noise reduction software you can get very good looking images out of ISO 6400 pictures.Metering: no more complaints for \"matrix overexposure\" fans, although I always felt that this \"overexposure\" is more related to poor usage of this metering mode on the D80. On D300, the matrix is spot on, and you'll like it as much as I do, on sunny, cloudy, evening and artificial light, including the TTL mode on flash.Focus: this will hit you. Actually nobody could understand (neither did I) what a pro-level focusing system means until you'll be using one. No more hit and miss, no more problems on portrait compositions, no more problems of focusing with AF points other than the central one. The settings menu will give you a plethora of possible focus combinations, and memory banks to save your settings for quick selection. When you'll get your D300, do this test: on continuous servo high speed, track a car. You could make a movie with those sharp images.Colors: I have a habbit, I always shoot in Adobe RGB mode. It is the best way to do when you are after the most color information from one scene. Moreover, even if you have aRGB jpegs, you can always assign a different lower-gamut profile in Adobe Photoshop CS3 or other image editing software. The colors ARE different than the D80's: closer to the warm side of the spectrum, gone is the sometime-magenta cast that you once noticed on your D80 especially under bright sun. The colors ARE PERFECT. So perfect that you can distinguish between subtle tonalities on flowers, skin tones and complexions, to a much better extent than with the D80. The shadows won't have any bluish creep anymore, dark is dark, black is black, maroon is maroon etc. Even at high ISO, the noise is more luminance than bluish. Again, you have a entire army of in-camera settings for colors, brilliance, contrast, hue ... you can customize your preferences for image rendition, you can save more than neutral-vivid-black and white modes personal settings for color and luminance settings. There is only one single exception to this perfection which you have to consider: when using dynamic D-lighting mode, colors tend to get more saturated as high as you get with your D-lightings settings. On RAWs (NEFs) this is easily corrected in your raw processing software, but on jpegs and tiffs, quite difficult.RAW mode: Please, please use Nikon Capture NX Software for Windows and Mac or ACR from Adobe Photoshop CS3. The results with Lightroom are horrendous in terms of noise reduction. I don't know why, it should have the same RAW engine as Photoshop CS3. UPDATE: These problems seem to come from preproduction firmware NEFs. I found no more problems opening NEFs in Lightroom with a production firmware camera.Please remember that the first 300.000 D300 sold also have a license for Capture NX included in the box (I also got it) so you won't have to spend on licenss. I like the way this software renders colors and noise even if it does not have the most impressive interface one ever built. One more advantage with Capture NX 1.3: you have a new \"Picture Control\" menu under \"Camera Settings\" which you can use to add custom picture settings to the D300 (and name them as you want \"less vivid\", \"more neutral\" etc) and a custom-curve editor that you can use to add more control to your custom picture preset. Moreover, the 1.3 version of NX picture control options come with some D2x-image-like presets that are great for rendering skin tones in portraits.Memory Card: if you shoot in 14-bit mode (recommended if you shoot RAW or TIFF and have to shoot high dynamic scenes), please remember that the RAW files, uncompressed, are somewhere around 25 MB each. Get a fast card. I bought a SanDisk 4 GB Extreme IV CompactFlash Card, that supports 40MB/s transfer. It runs smoothly, the camera buffer will not clog. Take care: 25 MB NEF file will stress your computer out and squeeze all resources from it. You need at least 2 GB of RAM (I have 4), and a fast processor. I have a Core2Duo 6300 plus win XP 64 bit edition to avoid RAM limitation. Update May 7, 2008: I bought also a 8GB 300x UDMA Lexar CF card to have another CF card for my camera and it seems to me that the write and read speed on the Lexar is inferior to the Sandisk Ultra IV. So my advice is to stick with Sandisk.I won't go into details, but I just want you to know that I have this camera for less than 24 hours, I already shot >100 photos (Update May 7, 2008: >3,000 photos; no hotspots, dead pixels, nada), and I love all of them. It is a perfect upgrade for my needs.Promise to come back with further news.Update (22 Jan 2008 - after two months of use):No problems whatsoever. The camera works like a charm. I'm delighted.Update (7 May 2008):No problems encountered. Meanwhile I purchased a Voigtlander APO Lanthar 90mm f/3.5 for Nikon which is an amazing lens - manual focusing - for its price, and a Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 EX DC HSM Lens which is quite a fun to use a get photos with it. Is nice to have the added possibility of using metering with an AIS-like lens.", "Date": "November 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "POW!", "Author": "Stephen Green \"VodkaPundit.com\"", "ReviewID": "R3EMWXWXE5YQ4R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before the D300 (and, sooner rather than later, the D3) I'd been giving serious thought to switching to Canon gear.  I'd seen what the Canon 5D could do with sharpness and color--results I just couldn't get out of my Nikon D200.  When Nikon announced the D300 and D3, I was skeptical.  The D3 looked great, but is out of my price range for now.  And the D300 seemed, at best, an evolutionary improvement over the D200.But I have an awful lot of money invested in Nikon gear, so I figured I'd give the D300 a shot.  After all, I could always return it to Amazon for a full refund.First impression?  The D300 is anything but evolutionary--it's a full-scale revolution for Nikon, and it's forever banished thoughts of Canon from my mind.Just shooting around the house, I find that the D300 can render colors, even true-looking, vibrant reds, like nothing short of Fuji's super-best Velvia film.  Soon I'l turn it loose at Garden of the Gods and we'll see what it can really do.  Best of all, the D300 can produce wild colors *and* natural skin tones--in the same shot!  I don't understand how that's possible, since jacking up a camera's color vibrancy usually ruins people's skin.  But Nikon has done it.I'm especially fond of Nikon's menus and user controls.  They're much more intuitive than Canon, at least to me.  And even though there is a wealth of new features compared to the D200, I've managed to discover them all--and learn them all--without ever once cracking open the user's manual.  Talk about intuitive!About those new features... wow!  Multi-level zoom on the back screen, so you'll never doubt whether your shots are in focus or not.  The screen itself is huge, and features the highest pixel density of any LCD screen anywhere.  Your shots will look amazing, even before you get prints made.  Dozens of other features with varying degrees of usefulness, I'll let more involved reviewers tell you about those.What counts for me is bold colors, great looking skin, and a camera that won't ever distract me from my shot, by forcing me to think about *how* to make the shot.  The D300 delivers on all three counts.", "Date": "December 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "One small step for Nikon... one giant step for mankind!", "Author": "Gerald Khoo", "ReviewID": "R2R9XMK4JG1VEA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been holding back from buying the D300 since the launch because I own a D200, but when my wife came home and surprised me with one... not only was I surprised by her gift, but also by what Nikon has packed inside this camera.  I will try not to write on what others have already said, but I'll point us to some areas which are new and may not have gotten enough attention towards.1. AF Fine Tuning - this is a great feature that puts in the user's hands the power to calibrate a lens to the camera body.  In the past, if you have a great prime lens (e.g. 85mm f/1.4) and want to calibrate it to work optimally to the camera body, you would need to send it to teh Nikon Service Center to do that.  With AF Fine Tuning, you can now do it yourself.  Because there will be a slight degree of inaccurarcy in AF systems, i.e. front or backward focusing, you can now fine tune that lens (with +/- 20) to the camera body so that it works optimally.  It recognizes Nikon lenses without a problem but 3rd party lenses would have to catch up.  It can store up to 12 lenses' fine tuning information, so that when you plug back that lens, it would know the fine tune data to use.2. Monochrome Picture Control - The monochrone picture control now comes with filter effects or yellow, orange, red, and green... so gone are the days of carrying these filters when taking black and white shots. You can also adjust the toning from black and white, sepia, cyanotype, and also a range of red, yellow, green, blue green, blue, purple blue, and red purple.3. Improved Picture Control for colors - the settings now are sharpening, contrast, brightness, saturation and hue.  You can also download from the internet D2XMODE picture controls (there are 3 modes) and load it in to emulate these modes from the D2X bodies.4. White balance fine tuning - The Canon 5D had long since had this feature in the white balance tuning where you can shift the white balance in a grid, and finally, this is now incorporated in this camera.  Even the other white balance fine tuning is much improved, e.g. for flourascent, it hast a list of different florescent lights to choose from for fine tuning.  For the present white balance, you can save up to 4 presets.5. In camera picture editing made easier - Once you take a picture, when you press the \"ok\" button, a list of in camera picture editing tools come up (where you can trim the pic, change to monochrone, use filter effects of skylight or warm filter, or edit the color balance).  The color balance feature here is great because you can shift the color balance of the picture to the desire effect you like.6. Help button - at anytime when you need some help as to what that feature is about, you only need to press the \"?\" button and it brings up a page explaing that feature.  This is like the D40/x and the menu layout also looks like that of the D40/x.The D300 is without a doubt leaps and bounds ahead of the D200 and their competitors.  The high ISO is great, and auto white balance more accurate.  It is without a doubt the best semi-pro camera Nikon has produced.-----After 2 months of using the D300, and shooting some events, this is what I have discovered about it. I thought it was going to be easy to move from a D200 to D300, but realized there is a learning curve as well. I was frustrated at not being able to capture a shot like I did with the D200, but as I discovered along the way while using the D300, that it gives you more flexibility and adjustments, which means more control in your hands... but that also means that just out of the box may not get you what you used to have almost out of the box for the D200.When shooting in a well-lit outdoor scenario, the D300 performs very well. Focusing is fast, sharp, and auto-ISO works well too. Most of my issue arise when shooting indoors with difficult lighting... and the following points have all to do with indoor shooting.- When shooting an indoor concert with a fast lens and no flash and using auto-ISO with different metering modes, the camera tends to over expose the shots, and some were very over exposed. The overexposure come from the inability of the D300 to decide what ISO to use, and in some scenarios, it went to ISO 1600 when ISO 200 or 400 in that lighting condition would do. Advise is to forget about auto-ISO with indoor shooting.- When shooting indoors without flash, the camera tends to overexpose the shot by 1/3 to 2/3 with matrix metering. This is easily resolved by adjusting the exposure compensation.  Another way is to use center-weighted average, which is more consistent in the metering.- The default sharpening for the D300 is less than the D200. Hence, the pictures may look a little soft, so would need to bump up the sharpening by maybe +3 in your picture control. This is more for shooting in jpegs, but some people prefer to leave the sharpening to post processing.- With a 12MP camera, my shooting flaws + lens sharpness is more evident. This is where breathing techniques, how to hold the camera, etc. becomes more evident with the pictures taken. Also, I have found the AF fine tuning useful to adjust the front or back focusing of the lenses... and even Nikon lenses needs some adjustments.- The LCD is too bright and does not reflect the true exposure of the picture.  The picture may look alright on the LCD but when downloaded onto a computer, it looked underexposed.  You would need to decrease the LCD brightness by -1 or -2.", "Date": "January 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "D300- Beautiful low light photography and blazing fast auto focus", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RRT9MMFJ2JH1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I couldn't resist the temptation to purchase the D300 as a upgrade for my D200. However, I told myself that I would return the D300 if I felt it wasn't a huge improvement over the D200. I was able to make that determination within minutes of opening the box. As soon as the D300 arrived I opened the box and inserted a freshly charged battery, a high speed CF card, and screwed on my Sigma 10-20 mm lens. Since this is a relatively slow lens (F4 to F5.6) I cranked up the ISO to 1600 and started shooting indoors. My impressions within 5 minutes of using the D300:1. Low light auto focusing and overall capability is a significant improvement over the D200. With ISO at 1600 and using no flash, my Sigma 10-20 mm lens focused very quickly. My D200 would often hunt in low light, resulting in blurry shots. The contrast between light and dark areas is stunning!2. Tremendous improvement over the D200 in overall noise. ISO 1600 is usable. I viewed images on my 20\" Imac at full screen and noise was very minimal.  My D200 maxes out at a noisy 800. I can now take usable flash free pics indoors and not have to worry about using flash3. 3\" LCD- Finally, an LCD lens that actually big enough and clear enough to display pics.4. Viewfinder- A definite improvement over the D200. I love having a 100% viewfinder5. Colors- Even without messing with any of the custom controls, colors are more vivid. The D200 is a bit washed out in comparison.6. Build quality- I had no complaints w/ my D200 and it is nice to see that Nikon did not skimp with the D300.Conclusion: The D300 is a remarkable improvement over the D200. Is it worth the price? For $1,799, I don't think the D300 has any competition. Is it worth upgrading from to the D300 from the D200? To me, the blazing quick auto focus and outstanding low light capability alone are worth the price. The LCD screen and 100% viewfinder are icing on the cake.

Being primarily a Canon photographer I always wondered what shooting with Nikon would be like.Let me just say, this Nikon is an absolute gem and pleasure to shoot with. The technology packed into this product is definitely a jump in quality making it worthy of being called a \"next generation\" DSLR.I could tell you about all the fancy specs, its abilities, and why people think it's better than Canon, but the other reviews pretty much say it all. Otherwise, this camera does deliver what it promises.I feel that both Canon and Nikon DSLR's are fantastic for people wanting to learn and/or continue their photography. Sure, right now I'd say Nikon absolutely has the lead in technology, but historically these two companies have been going back and forth all along so eventually Canon will take the crown back.My advice for anyone seriously considering buying this camera or any DSLR (since it'll put a nice size whole in your pocket) is go to the store and test out the camera that is right for you. See what best fits in your hand, build quality, weight, etc... because I guarantee 8/10 people buying these cameras won't notice any difference in image quality. Both Canon's and Nikon's are fully capable cameras so it's really the photographer who makes ANY difference.(Last bit of advice would be to buy your gear online cause stores tend to mark up their stuff to a nice inflated price. Also, when buying these DSLR's, the glass you have (i.e LENSES) make more difference than the camera you're using (especially after >8.0MP).Good luck and just have fun with your camera!

Nikon has made an excellent product. I won't bother writing about the various technical features. Those are already amply detailed in the camera description.

Very useful.There are many playback features such as zooming in close on an image and navigating around in it. A big improvement over previous models.The new playback screen is much bigger and has an awesome resolution. You can live preview on it. Very cool!There are several focus options, including the 51 point focus.You can press help on any menu item and it will explain what that item is clearly and easy to read.The menu is easy to navigate and easy to use. The 421 page User's Manual may seem daunting at first, but it's very clearly written and has several ways to cross-reference what you are looking forThe camera is comfortable to hold, has a solid feel and all of the controls are within easy reach. Shooting mode, ISO and most other controls can be easily changed without going into the menu.All the above are features, but the most important benefit is excellent and sharp images.If you would like to see some samples, email me and I will send you a link so you can check them out. I am very satisfied and I am glad I bought this camera. I may add to this review as I use this camera more. I just wanted to write a review to express how satisfied I am.Note November 29: After 300 shots the battery indicator is on half empty. If correct, then battery life much shorter than D50.

Not many of us can afford to replace a $5,000- $8,000 camera annually.I have used Nikon Cameras since the NIKON F was introduced.  We use multiple photographers in my wedding business and I have never been happy with our photo sharpness and quality since we migrated from the medium format Hasselblad film cameras to the Nikon D100, D70, D200; Fuji S2, S3; and Canon 20D, 30D, XT, XTi cameras.  With the advent of the D300 we see a major improvement in linearity of the image quality at both ends of the characteristic curve, there is much better control of the shoulder (highlights), and we see more detail more faithful color reproduction and much less noise  in the toe, (dark areas) and picture to picture variation minimization.  It has been difficult to get matching exposures when taking multiple flash photos of the same subject taken seconds apart.  Finally, we have a camera that reliably an repeatedly reproduces the subject we are photographing brides, grooms or the Gymnast portraits we shoot!Our on photo-journalistic bridal photographs are much more controlled, with improved control of the detail in the whites of the gown.  The Fuji S3, and the Nikon D200 showed improvement in this area, but the D300 is a big step up from it's look-a-like the D200.Focus is another area that Nikon has improved tremendously with the adoption of 51 focus points.  This was my chief reason for changing back to NIKONs from the my Canon Cameras.  I purchased Canon's best quality lenses, yet I still had to take additional photos with my Canon cameras to assure that my focus was where I want it.  Formal Groups in churches can be difficult, as the camera wants to focus on the background instead of the group.  One other interesting note, is that we get many more closed eyes with the Canon 580 strobes than we do with the Nikon SB800. I wonder if the infrared frequency of the Canon autofocus system is more visible to some people than is the Nikon infrared system.  I do know that we get less closed eye shots with the Nikon than we do with the Canons which my assistants use.Prevention of over exposure of mens faces, causing a Pillsbury dough boy look due to camera metering subject failure when using available light or flash wedding to take pre-wedding portraits is another area that Nikon has trumped Canon with the D3 and D300 metering improvements.The Nikon D300 is a great wedding camera which has improved my available light ceremony photography, at ISO 3200.... with minimal sensor noise.I love using this camera, and highly recommend the D300.", "Date": "May 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent workhorse", "Author": "Guari", "ReviewID": "R13T83SRPZI6HU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an amateur with experience (meaning I don't pay my bills through photography). I previously owned a D70 and an EOS for 35mm film.Thing is, I wanted to upgrade the digital system I had with the D300 and, in summary, the camera is SO BEAUTIFUL, SO RELIABLE, INCREDIBLE PICTURES, etc etc... it's a dead-on choice for a digital SLR!!This camera has many pluses:-Many pro's says 12Mpx for an APS sensor (= sensor with a conversion factor, smaller than a 35mm film's frame size) is too much for such a small sensor, since the image's will be quality-restricted because the pixels are too small... My response is that after shooting for a couple years with a 6 Mpx D70, the quality difference IS GREAT... There IS a leap in resolving power with the 12Mpx sensor in the D300.. It blew my mind away. More on this at the end of the review.- The D300 picture controls, specially saturation, reaches a level of in-camera adjustments unheard of in previous Nikon DSLR's. Saturation levels will reach levels comparable with Fuji's Velvia film, and that's a lot! This gives you the advantage of reduced post-production, since you are capable of tweaking pictures in-camera  that will suit your taste (It did for me)- Active D-lighting. DSLR's tend to have problems with highlly contrasted subjects (Subjects with ample dynamic range), and this is one of the many reasons why many pro's still use film (because it will deal better with high contrast). The ADL function in the D300 does allows me to capture contrasty subjects under difficult light conditions, reducing highlight blowout in the picture, while preserving shadow detail.. It really works. It allows me to use digital for shot's that would have required film or in-camera filtration!- Splendid ISO range!! Now I can take pictures in very low light conditions that would have been impossible with my D70 because of the high noise inherent to a high ISO. The D300 does manage high ISO noise like no other camera I've used in the past! ISO 1600 images are very very clean (ISO3220 is clean, HI-1 mode (ISO 6400) is too noisy for me)! This is great news! This also means I don't have to lug a tripod for low light shots (unless I were doing landscape work; In such case, I do use a gitzo tripod for every shot I take, which takes me to the following point):- Mirror up mode! I didn't have this feature in my D70, and I love to be able to raise the mirror when doing tripod shots (Landscape) in order to gain maximun sharpness by minimizing vibrations.. Also included are Live view mode (It allows you to see the subject in the camera LCD while composing the picture, instead of using the viewfinder. I use this feature when the camera position won't allow me to see through the finder, and it really helps).- The D300 autofocus is very reliable (3D autofocus mode is realy helpful when tracking moving subjects). Very high frame per second count ( Up to 8 FPS with the accessory grip).- Weather sealed. I live in a tropical part of the world, where things can get pretty damp and wet, and the D300 is all about getting pictures, and I don't have to worry about the weather!!- 14 bit RAW is the way to go if you are interested in the highest image quality and rich tonal gradations. My D300 gives me that option! with my D70, i had to work with an inferior 12 bit Raw file... I usually shoot RAW (14 bit) + JPG (You NEED a a 4 Gigs CF card as a minimum, since the files tend to be big..)- Last, the camera allows me to save the combination of settings i need tuned for specific purposes. I have a menu bank tuned for portraits, another menu bank for landscape, another for low-light conditions and another one for highlly saturated images! This is just wonderfull!! For example, let's say I am doing tripod work and I need to change the camera setting for portrait work, and I need to do it FAST, instead of browsing  all the settings I need to change, I just select a menu bank tuned for portraits, so I don't loose my time changing setting by setting!On the minus side:- Nikon didn't implement a release timer when using mirror up mode, which seems foolish to me, since a timed release AND mirror up, when used on a tripod, are the way to go in order to reduce vibrations... this forced me to buy a release cable, and this leads me to the next point:- The cable release for this camera is of the 10 pin family, and it is expensive, compared to the 15$ IR release I used on my D70...- As much as I've become in love with Active D-lighting, there are times when i need to turn it off. This happens when I shoot for silhouttes (heavy backlighting) since I WANT a deep, textureless black ( silhouttes are meant to look like that) and the ADL function will try to preserve shadow detail, creating a murky grey instead of a deep black.To sum it up, this camera is great!! My jaw still falls wide open whith amazement with the images coming out from the D300...One final point: I HAD an EOS 35mm film camera, because I no longer feel that 35 mm film gives me superior quality when compared to my beloved D300!!! This camera is THAT GOOD!April 2008:Thousands of photos have gone through.. I can only say that THIS IS THE DSLR!!  I just couldn't be happier!!!!I'd like to add a minus that I've come to encounter:I do a lot of night shooting in low ISO, and this is the only thing I've seen that this camera isn't that good. Thing is, any digital sensor will generate noise related to circuitry (electrons, charges and stuff) and some digital cameras will tend to create more noise than others (though all of them do generate noise) when exposure times start to get on the long side (minutes).The D300 isn't good at very long exposures in very low light (longer than 5 minutes). It generates a lot of noise via hot pixels. Nikon knows that this happens, so they implemented a Long exposure noise reduction (NR) which basically takes a second frame withoutt letting any light hit the sensor (This is called a black frame). This black frame will only contain pure black + electronic noise. This frame is substracted to the original long exposure, and this method will indeed reduce most of the noise in the frame.Problem is, when NR gets to work by substracting the black frame, it will soften the image (the image will loose some sharpness) due to the nature of the substraction algorithm. To me, this loss of sharpness is unacceptable (And notice, this happens to ALL Dslr's, just that it is pronounced in the D300) and this is the main reason why I still shoot film (no electrons = no noise) though I sold my film EOS.I took a deep breath, checked my wallet after the D300, and took the plunge and bought a medium format camera (a Hasselblad 501) to do the things no digital camera can do; For me, it's mainly very long exposures and for Black and white film (When I REALLY need a very high dynamic range)...

(Although with custom menus one could create such if desired).  It is possible to charge the battery, attach a lens, and shoot right out of the box; however the real power in this machine lies in knowing all of the controls available and applying those controls to achieve the desired results.The physical feel of the machine is one of solidness; I've added the external battery grip (which allows the entire machine to function off of 8 AA batteries, as well as Nikon camera batteries) and the balance, for my hands, is as good as I've ever had in a camera.  (The external grip also bumps the frames per second from 6 to 8 when using AA's or some Nikon camera batteries.).I've not weighed the machine with an 18-200 VR lens and external grip w/batteries, but it's a heavyweight and I would recommend a different strap than the Nikon supplied strap that comes with the camera body.There is no \"stealth mode\" on this machine as there is on my Canon G-9 P&S; the shutter is loud, and putting it into rapid fire mode at 8 fps will get the attention of those around you.The camera will be happiest with high speed compact flash cards - Extreme IV's, Ducati's, or other cards of that ilk.  Slow cards, especially if one is capturing NEF+jpg fine images will slow the write buffer down.  Plan on getting 4 gig or 8 gig cards - they fill up rather quickly.I will let others comment on the images this camera can record - I've not had enough field experience yet to give an intelligent opinion.  However, I will say that the camera (again) is not designed for shooting on automatic, out of the box.  This machine requires input from the operator to function well.  Also this machine requires good lenses to maximize it's potential; the 18-200 VR Nikkor that works so well on my D70S seems softer on the D300.Heavily recommended for:Those who have Nikon cameras and have maxxed out the possibilities with those machines and are looking for greater challenges.  The D300 will support Nikkor lenses made since 1959 (although the ones made before 1977 may need a minor, inexpensive modification to fit on the D300).  Not all older lenses, of course, support auto-focus.Those who have other camera brands but who have not yet invested large sums in glass or accessories.Those who wish to become involved in photography at a serious level; this machine requires investment of both time and money.Not recommended for:Well heeled users who are looking for an expensive point-and-shoot or all-automatic machine.I am massively pleased with the D300 (good thing, considering the cost of one of the machines for a non-pro photographer!).My only real gripe is the cost of the machine - and the \"hidden\" costs associated, such as faster CF cards, better lenses, upgrading camera bags (this is a large beast and what my D70S fits into comfortably won't hold the D300 with grip and lens attached).However, at the level that the D300 plays in it is comparable in price with it's counterparts and (currently) it's feature set is well above the competition.  Of course, that latter part will change - no one camera model stays on top for very long.HTH", "Date": "May 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "The perfect photographer's camera", "Author": "R. G.

This makes the camera feel very fast and responsive.  Everything about the camera is designed to allow you to change settings quickly and effortlessly.  An example:  the auto-ISO feature changes completely how you shoot in quickly changing lighting.  Think about shooting sports in a stadium where half the field is covered in shadow - with auto-ISO you can set your parameters and then forget about the camera and just worry about catching the action.  It also features endless customization which is great when you have to live with your camera day and night - if something in the interface annoys you, just change it to what you like.(2) 100% viewfinder:  a pleasure to use.  Framing is perfect and the size of the image seems huge.  No, it's not like an F6 or D3, but it is the best cropped-sensor viewfinder to date.  You can buy a magnifying eyepiece that gives you a bigger view at the expense of eye relief.(3) picture controls: allow you to dial in settings in-camera and create great looking JPGs without any post-processing.(4) built-in GPS support is wonderful:  I am able to geotag all my photos on trips and display them on Google Maps when I get home.  This is also an essential tool for surveying or scientific work.(5) live view:  perfect for macro and landscape work.  It is designed to be used on a tripod for slow and methodical pictures, not for over-the-head grab shots on NFL sidelines.(6) The camera can use pretty much all Nikon glass made since 1959.

I have had everything from a Canon EOS 1N, to a 1V, 1D, 1D Mark IIN, etc.  But I gave up on Canon because they didn't have camera bodies that were light, or small enough but also took amazing photos.  I switched from Canon to Leica and bought the $5,000 M8.  A truly incredible machine worthy of the high price tag.  But it was limited.  I found after using it for several months that I had gotten used to having all the latest bells and whistles that the new digital SLRs have.So, I spend countless hours researching what Canon to get.  Luckily, I needed a camera with auto focus for a shoot and my friend loaned me her D300.  I can honestly say that it was love at first sight.  I had only had the Leica for a couple of weeks, but I knew at that moment I had to ditch it.The D300 has just about everything I'm looking for in a camera.  Yes, I would love it if it could fit into my shirt pocket, be as light as a feather, etc.  But it isn't.  It is however, when paired with my Nikon 17-55mm DX lens about 1.2 pounds lighter than my Canon EOS 1D Mark IIN when paired with the Canon 24-70mm L lens.  And I have to say, I think this is as capable, if not more capable than that camera and lens system.  The shots I have gotten from it are unlike anything else I've taken.  They have a depth and clarity that I rarely got from my Canon gear.Here are my plus points:1.  The feel of the camera.  It sits in your hands nicely and you know you're holding something strong and robust.2.  All of the latches, seals, doors, etc. are nice and tight.  They don't feel like plastic, but like a composite of some kind.  Everything snaps nicely into place without protest.3.  Images are extremely sharp and the color rendition is incredible.4.  It's size.  It's not so small and light that you think you're going to break it.  But not so big that you wouldn't want to bring it everywhere with you.5.  There are so many dials and buttons right at your finger tips.  It takes longer to learn than my trusty old Canon system did, but once I got the hang of it, it was easy.6.  The 3\" display is a marvel.  It makes my images sing!7.  The dust removal system.  Haven't had a lot of time to test this out, but if it works, it's great.  It doesn't take more than a second and makes almost no noise.8.  The shutter seems much quieter than my Canon.  It is definitely much quieter than my Leica which sounded like a plane landing.That's about it.  I just really love it.  Well done Nikon! With this I believe they can overtake Canon in sales and if not in sales, than in customer satisfaction.No Canon has felt like this in my hands except for the $4,000 1D models which are bears to carry around.  I won't lie and say the D300 is the best SLR out there.  The Canon EOS 1Ds Mark III is world beyond this, but it's $8,000.  And no one needs 21.1mp.  The Nikons 12.3mp will satisfy anyone for many years to come.  Very large enlargements can be made from this camera.  My website [...] will be showcasing many photos taken with this beauty.

I have been shooting on a d200 and a d70s for the past few years, and this completely changes the way I am able to shoot.  There are a few notable qualities; Active D-Lighting, High ISO Performance, and Focusing.  After fooling around with the active d-lighting, I have come to realize how amazing a tool it can be if utilized correctly.  It will pretty much add a little more contrast and pop to your images.  Portraits look great with it.  In terms of focusing, the new 51 point 3D tracking system is amazing.  I shot a few pictures of sports, and it worked flawlessly with my 70-200 2.8 vr lens.Finally, the ISO performance at high ISOs is unbelievable.  On my d200, I can shoot up until about 800 or so without getting some grain.  However, the d300 is able to shoot up to 1600, or even 2000 without much grain.  And pictures shot at LOW-1.0, which is the equivalent of ISO 100, are simply gorgeous.  My fast f2.8 lens is going to lose a bit of its usefulness because of the ability to shoot at higher ISOs without worrying about grain.

I have SB-600 (which by itself can only be used as a remote, unlike the SB-800) and it can be used a wireless remote flash unit. The D300 then controls the flash output and does the metering automatically. This allows the remote to serve as the key and the pop up on camera flash can then be set as the fill light.

I owned and still own a couple of Nikons, so for me it was a very easy transition, and finally Nikon has a good comprehensive manual to go wth the camera ifyou need any help. Also, for the first time the Capture NX is included - sort of: Ok I had to download it, and insert the product key, regardless this is a good step by Nikon, and it was about time!!The focusing screen is much better designed now, and if you get the MD-D10 multi-power battery pack for the built in motor drive, it will  be faster than my D2X and also has a lot bigger buffer up to 100 shoots for jpg, vs only 35 on my D2X, and with the  right adapter BL-3 it will take the same high capacity battery as my D2X uses! The only drawback is that nobody has the BL-3 adapter in STOCK!As for image quality, it is excellent even at higher ISO, I tested the D300 at 400, 800 and 1600 ISO, unlike the D2X which is only good up to 320 or maybe 400 before some noise is noticable and gets worse very fast after that as ISO is increased.

So here's my own personal spin (non-technical): my first DSLR was a Sony A100.  After being frustrated with the autofocus and wanting to upgrade lenses, yet finding them expensive and hard-to-find, I decided it was time to jump ship and go with either Nikon or Canon from this day forward.  I was completely torn between choosing the Nikon D90, the D300 or going with the new Canon 50D. Choosing a brand for lenses seemed almost more crucial to me than the camera itself!  In the end, I came to the conclusion that ANY one of these cameras or brands would be completely fantastic in it's own special way.  Compare all you want, but they each have something unique that sets them aside and made them a draw in my mind; as a bonus, all were within my price range.  The dealbreaker came when I finally got a hold of a Canon 50D in my hands and found that as much as I LOVED the feel of the camera, the menu navigation just didn't click with me as much as Nikon's menu (complete personal preference here).  So that made it easier to choose Nikon.  Having held both (which I HIGHLY recommend), the D300 felt more solid and secure in my hands.  I was hesitant because it does lack the \"cheater\" settings as I call them, but I took the leap anyways.  I have not looked back for a moment!  If I didn't have the extra money to spare OR if I wasn't comfortable with my own settings, the D90 would have been just as fantastic!  But to me, the D300 is a camera with a lot more potential to learn and expand over the years.  I see myself keeping it for many, many years and only ever spending my money on lenses anymore.  With the D90, I fear I would have wanted to upgrade the camera again in a few years to something more professional, consequently cutting into my lens fund!Conclusion: pick a camera today that you would like to keep and grow with; then use all your money in the future for better and better lenses, regardless of what new camera is announced. For me, the D300 is definitely the one: this camera is a keeper so now I can focus the rest of my time and money on building my glass collection!", "Date": "October 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "The D300 is a superb camera.", "Author": "David Siegel", "ReviewID": "RGROFY7YHHG56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the D300 for slightly over a month now and so far I haven't been disappointed in any way with how it's performed. At the beginning I wasn't getting pictures as sharp as I would have liked them but that was mostly my fault and since then I've refined my technique and I don't think I've ever seen sharper results. The camera is fast and paired with a faster CF card you can just keep shooting and never run out of buffer space shooting in raw.If you're coming from an older camera like the D70s like I did, some of the new features may take some getting used to, the biggest change was the focus points. They did away with Closest Subject, the Dynamic Area focus is now quite complex with options for 9/21/51/51 point 3d area tracking options and the third option is \"Big White Rectangle Mode\" Ken Rockwell refers to it as such and since I can't remember it's actual name, I'll just refer to it that way. BWRM uses all 51 points automatically and the camera decides what should be the focus point, so far it's worked great for me, the things I want in focus are usually sharp, sometimes it gets it wrong, but since the camera can't read my mind, I don't mind really. Unfortunately the camera can sometimes be bogged down in 51 point mode if there's a really busy scene. The focus can sometimes lag before taking your initial shot but if you choose a mode with less than all 51 points then you'll never have this problem.Battery life on a single EN-EL3e seems to be around 400-500 shots with heavy LCD usage which is much better than I thought it would be. Still, I ordered a second battery and the MB-D10 grip so I can continuously shoot without stopping to change batteries. I'll probably do an update to this review once the grip is here.I don't think I can say anything bad about the camera, it's definitely a step up from the D70s, using the D300 exclusively then trying out the D70s makes the D70s feel like a child's toy.

I won't bore you with the same things others write: yes, it's amazing sharp, crisp and smooth operation. Almost anything you can thing of, can be changed or tweaked. The front and rear dials, the preview and function button, etc. Liveview is and understatement: it really is Live PREVIEW! Or you could call it WYSISYG (what you see is what you get). This is not even covered in the manual! In both liveview modes you see the change in White balance, but also any filters, sharpness and any other things you apply, right away, before you even take a picture. The only thing you, obviously, don't see, is the effect of aperture and shutter speed. Picture control is fantastic: you can use standard or vivid, but these can be adjusted also and you can preview it in liveview.A lot of color filters that can also be adjusted, so you can make a \"midnight\" picture in the sunshine! I'm still learning about the focus system, which is ahead of it's time. Finally I can track birds in flight and get sharp pictures without the focus system going \"on a search\".Minuses? I only found a few: the battery indicator is not reliable with 3d party batteries. It was on \"empty, 2 %\" after which I could still shoot about 150 pictures! But maybe the battery needs to be charged a few times. The NX software is very, very good, but also very slow. It easily outperforms Photoshop in quality, but go have some coffee if you plan to do Noise reduction in better quality! 10 minutes is nothing. The NX Transfer software is not tested or not enough: it crashes regularly. Camera Control Pro 2.0 is not only very overpriced (it should have come for free); it was increased in price from about $60.- to $180.-, just because of the D3 and D300 Liveview modes. This is very bad, since both the Liveview modes still should be in BETA testing! Th picture is horrible, unstable and shakes and jitters like an amateur wrote it. Shame on Nikon about that.

Moving to this body from a backup or lower end DSLR, you'll need to deal with the extra weight and probably want to invest in a better strap.

The D80 is a very good camera, and the D300 is a significant upgrade.

This leads to images looking better than what they looked like in real life.The exposure of the camera is excellent as well.  Rarely does it under or overexpose an image. Autofocus is both quick and accurate.  It really makes taking high-quality pictures easy. I spend almost no time having to fix the image in Photoshop.While the high ISO performance is significantly improved from the aforementioned D80,  noise still can show up in poor lighting around ISO 1600 and above.  I sometimes shoot ice hockey and can find it difficult to get satisfactory shots if the rink's lighting is poor even while using a 2..8  70-200mm VR zoom wide open at 2.8.

The D300's tweaks and far more processing power have made it possible to realize superior image quality. These improvements are readily seen in the images you shoot. The D300 has an amazing automatic ability to fix color fringes. This gives better and sharper results. No need to activate this, it just works.

BUT the desire for this Nikon D300 kept nagging at me as I read more and more reviews.  The best review ever is from The Imaging Resource (google it).  So, I sold my Nikon D80, Nikon D200, and 3 prime lenses to pay for this new camera.  I also purchased David Busch's Nikon D300 Digital Field Guide, which is very helpful.  You will read all about this camera in many other reviews.  I just want to say that color is accurate, Build quality is awesome, User friendly. Very little nose at high ISO.  I think my favorite aspect is the four separate shooting menus.  They are very user friendly (even for me), independent of each other, and you can always reset it to default if you think you are getting lost.  I felt very safe navigating through all the menus.  I use it with the Nikon 16-85mm VR lens (approx $600).  Yes, you can take good photos with it right out of the box.  Of course, you have more control over exposure, depth of field etc as you learn more about the camera.  This is my advice.  If you have the money, $1700 approx,  buy this camera body!  It is the finest camera body you can buy without going to full frame, which is immensely more expensive.  Go ahead and buy Nikon kit zoom lens and upgrade to a more expensive lens down the road if you want to.  In the digital world, it is the camera body that is crucial for accurate color rendition etc.  As far as the lens goes, Nikon doesn't make a crappy lens.  I find the VR (vibration reduction) lens very helpful because I don't like to use tripods. It is a bit on the heavy side compared to D80 because it is solid Magnesium Alloy body.  If you want light weight, buy a compact. In the Nikon D300 manual, Nikon clearly states to never touch the sensor at all in any way. If you can't get the sensor dust off by blowing or by the built in dust vibration system, than make sure that a very qualified Nikon authorized person does it.  (this goes for all digital SLR cameras).  My previous film cameras were Minolta SRT 102, Leica Rangefinder M2, Contax with Zeiss lens, so I have owned some of the best.  This new Nikon D300 DX digital camera does not disappoint me.  I am going to get a lot of enjoyment out of it.

I was very happy with the images they produced.  I was even strongly considering the 5D when along came the D300 w/ 18-200 VR lens.  We all know Canon and Nikon regularly leapfrog each other.  But I seriously believe 2008 is Nikon's year.  I compared the image results from the 40D and D300 and the latter just trumped the 40D hands-down on every aspect.  It was close to film quality.  Colors were more vivid, ergonomics are MUCH better, a rockin' LCD screen, dust and weather sealing, 51 AF points, 100% viewfinder coverage, vital controls like flash exposure compensation are not buried in the menu, ISO 1600 images with little decrement in quality, etc. Taking photographs is lots of fun with this bad boy.  Another big reason for the switch was the 18-200 VR lens.  Instead of changing lenses and risking dust to get in the sensor, I just leave this lens on and it does most everything I've ever wanted in a walkaround lens.

One of them let us try his new D300. And the consequence? We said we will buy it soon and I took my D300 home 1 month ago.Nikon D300 has such a beautiful LCD 3\" monitor. I can't help staring at the bright images it displays. And to a not so young person like me, its viewfinder is a gift. I suddenly find myself seeing much more in photo composition. The buttons are all at the right place, especially the OK button where I can simply press the centre of the multi selector. True, the camera is bigger and heavier than D80. The first day I found this a bit uncomfortable. However, once I get used to it, D80 seems to be too light and too small!As for photo quality, it is clearly more superior with noise reduction performing beautifully - especially when you shoot at ISO 1600. Its autofocusing system is much faster. I put the same old AF lens to D80 and D300 and the difference is apparent. D80 has already allowed me to take wonderful wildlife photos. And D300 excels at low light condition. Under daylight, it shoots photos bright (compared with the darker photos of D80) and the colour more natural (compared with the more vivid and deeper shades of D80). Sometimes I prefer to have darker photos so I activate the useful active D-lighting feature to adjust the contrast. As for the white balance, the available colours for adjustment is impressive. When pressing the shutter button to shoot, despite the camera's heavier weight, the handshake effect is actually reduced. Perhaps it is the mechansim or the centre of gravity that makes this happen. The continuous high speed shooting (6 fps) allows me to capture the egret take-off easily. Yes, I admit I have not used the live view extensively - the bright big viewfinder is simply alluring. Also, I haven't studied the manual word by word - I flip through a few pages only. But that's because most buttons are so user friendly, you can guess and shoot.Not to mention the free Capture NX software accompanying the camera. I must admit I need only a handful of the many features of Capture NX eg adjusting the brightness of a tiny region of the photo, increasing the intensity and sharpness of the photo etc. It is at such a professional level that makes the picture perfect.Some people emphasize again and again about sharpness of the image and focusing speed. However, I find the colours, contrast and exposure even more important in my consideration. Take a sunset photo and I see amazing colours of the dusk on the photo! Also, I won't need to worry whether my 20-year old Nikon lenses can be incompatibale with D300. They just fit and focus steadfastly and accurately on the object (albeit not as fast as the new Nikon AF-S lenses.) To top it all, the old manual lens can have autoexposure on D300 but not on D80. As for the flash, both D80 and D300 built in flash serves most of my purposes. D300 exposure program is so intelligent that sometimes the flash output is not as bright as I want, so I just use flash compensation.With my D300, I can carry it everywhere and experiment with creative shots. But don't worry about my D80, I intend to keep it, especially when the trip is tough and long. After all, that is when I need to move fast and light!

All the main things that you need to change are on the outside of the camera.In low indoor light I fould that the hand held pictures were a little dark and had too much image noise(ISO 3200 using aperture priority setting). One tip is to up exposure compensation by +0.7 or more which gives very quiet pictures which you can then post process to -7.0 if you wanted.The dynamic range of the camera coupled with the real time \"Adaptive D-Lighting\" means that I don't have to use my gradual grey filters so often.For me the 12MP is not such an advantage as I never crop or print poster sized pictures. My Brother used a 6MP camera (D50) and actually produced poster sized photos for his company which they were very pleased with and paid him alot of money for. One of my customers was paid \u00a33000 when he snapped 80 photos of a balloon going over his house with a D40.

It was absolutely the right choice for me; the autofocus system, greatly improved image quality (I'm thinking of sensor noise and dynamic range when I say that), and LCD monitor are the three areas where I most notice the improvement. The improved viewfinder is also nice, and I've used the live view feature to compose a handful of shots that I could not otherwise frame.Is the D300 the right choice for you?Make sure you handle a D300 before you buy. The ergonomics of a camera are far more important than most people realize; compare the location of important dials and buttons to other similar cameras, such as the offerings from Canon, Sony, or Pentax. If you prefer the ergonomics of a different manufacturer, you would do yourself a substantial favor by respecting that preference. The most important feature of a camera is how thin of a barrier it provides between you and your photography; poorly matched ergonomics represent a thick barrier. If you already use Nikon SLR cameras, you know what to expect.If you only take snapshots, but don't like point and shoot cameras, take a look at the D40, or possibly the D40X. You will be frustrated by the extra knobs and dials on the D300, and won't really leverage the extra features that you're paying for. Put the extra money towards a good all-in-one zoom, like the Nikon 18-200mm.If you're a beginning photographer, you should seriously consider the D70 or D80 as a starting point. There will be fewer features to get between you and your photography, but still more than enough to keep you occupied for several years, or 20,000 pictures-- whichever comes first. Put the extra money towards good lenses, like constant-aperture zoom lenses, or fast primes; alternatively, consider buying a high-quality tripod, one that you would feel comfortable using with a top-of-the-line camera.If you have a D200, you should probably skip the D300. The image quality and feature set are similar; save your money, and wait for the next-generation Nikon digital SLR. If the money is burning a hole in your pocket, maybe you'd like to pick up a similarly-priced lens.If you have anything more expensive than a D200, you surely know what you're getting into, and don't need my opinion to tell you otherwise.

Lewis", "ReviewID": "R1HOYD0NVXVC7P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been planning to buy a second DSLR body when the D300 came out late last year. At the time I was using a Nikon D200 and was very happy with the quality and versatility of that camera. I decided to put off my purchase and see how the new D300 was received by both  amateur and  professional photographers. After reading many reviews I decided to go for the D300 and I couldn't be happier. I shoot in a wide variety of situations, from indoor and outdoor sporting events, wildlife photography,fine art images, to portraits and advertising. So the ability to shoot fast and under varied lighting conditions was of considerable importance to me. I was happy with the abilities of the D200 when paired up with fast lenses. But fast lenses tend to be expensive lenses and although I do have a couple of great fast lenses, I primarily use a 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 VR lens just for its versatility. With the High ISO/Low Noise capability of the New D300, I gain about 2 stops over the D200. What that ultimately means is I can shoot without a flash in more situations and maximize the flashes capability when I do use it. Another feature of the D300 is Active D-Lighting. This feature allows you to preserve the details in high contrast images such as those with a bright sky and a darker foreground by expanding the dynamic rang of the image.This  saves you from spending lots of extra time making adjustments to each image later in post processing at home. I have now shot about 10,000 images with the D300 and I find the build quality to be solid as a rock. The camera is a bit on the heavy side, but  not so much so as to be uncomfortable. The large LCD display is much brighter an easier to see than that of the D200 and the addition of 'Live View\", the ability to see through the lens on the LCD screen,  makes composition and focusing in awkward positions much easier. Overall, although the D200 and D300 share many great features and look very similar, the D300 is a much more serious Pro-sumer camera which is very well suited for the rigors and wide ranging needs of both the Amateur and Professional Photographer.", "Date": "April 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nikon D300 Deserves Its Accolades: A Genuine Classic", "Author": "John McPhee", "ReviewID": "R4O63YJI2VJUC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In my opinion, the effusive accolades given to this camera were well earned. I was skeptical until I used it. After all, there are lots of good cameras to choose from: Fujifilm, Olympus, Pentax and Sony, not just the leading duo Nikon and Canon. In fact, this review includes good alternatives to the D300 for prospective shoppers of mid and high-end DSLR cameras. I will begin with Nikon's D300 since it was the best choice for me. You are more important than the tool. But if you want to make the best photographs you can and enjoy doing it then the tool can make a difference in assisting you. Some tools are also easier to use and some are built to last longer - camera bodies are no exception - you see the difference in the price tag. The Nikon D300 does not just do more, it does more that you choose it to do in customizable features. It is no longer almost exclusively a question of optical glass configurations determining everything we see that matters when the D300 camera body assists them by doing things as fundamental as \"correct\" chromatic aberrations and inherent distortions of individual lenses. This camera, which borrowed so much from the flagship Nikon D3 has really pushed the envelope.There are very good alternatives right now. For those wanting exemplary image quality with much of what the D300 offers but for significantly less money: Canon offers the popular Canon EOS 40D 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) and Nikon now has attractive pricing for its popular D200, the fine camera that the D300 updated in late 2007 Nikon D200 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only). It has also earned many loyal followers and has a very solid build.But once in a long while something extraordinary is designed that stands out from a very distinguished and competitive field. I am not regularly  gonzo over gear. I will simply address the current field with options for your consideration while your money is still in your pocket. Thinking about the history of photography does not involve ranking accomplishment by merely which tools, the means that were used. But we do each need to make our personal choice. Any of the cameras mentioned here should make you very happy. Only you will know which one in particular matches your needs and desires.The performance and potential of the D300 camera make it stand out to me. I have less work to do in image editing and the quality of the capture is the best I have seen. There are lots of places to read in detail about all its features including those shared with Nikon's outstanding premium camera, the D3. The D300 is not cheap but is durable and Nikon has been generous for what it offers and for what you can deliver with it. That is its most compelling case, its quality, performance and value. I realize praising engineering is not exciting reading - despite that being Nikon's historical strength - but it is their breakthroughs that I value most in the D300. That includes an entire series of triumphs in interrelated areas including color, tonal nuance, metering for better exposures and more extensive creative controls where you actually get to apply your intelligence and talents. Automated everything is also available but if you are exclusively shooting like that particularly in JPEGs there are many other good cameras to consider buying that will do that well for far less money beginning under $500 including a zoom lens like Nikon D40 6.1MP Digital SLR Camera Kit with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens. In fact all well known brands offer much better cameras than you might expect for their price at the so called entry level but that is another topic. You may be upgrading from one to the D300. That is not a subtle leap beginning empirically and then simply  holding each in your hands. It is just not fair or necessary to compare things so wide apart.The D300's precision is amazing. It is going to spoil me regarding expectations in small camera photography. Want a closer look? Composing or fine tuning sharpening while looking at stunning color in \"Live View\" modes (yes, there are two) on the camera back's brilliant 3\" scratch resistant monitor is not bad either. The ultimate measure is the quality of results as well as the creative options and degree of control. They could directly assist you with what you want to say, show, express. All cameras do that but I recommend this extraordinary camera because for some it might assist you in doing it better than with an alternative. That is a testable premise but with subjective criteria. Consider renting one if that is a reasonable option. Seeing really is believing in this case. Otherwise there are lots of other cameras to convince you that one will be right for you.Test your options. For example, Canon offers an excellent body in the same price range, that can be a few hundred dollars more, it usually is not a large difference. The Canon EOS 5D 12.8 MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) offers full frame capture if we use 35mm film as \"normal\" coverage. By that I mean, in theory, it can use the same lenses you used in 35mm film photography.  Just check to ensure your lenses do not have any vignetting problems, light fall off,  in their new application. Canon has made many excellent lenses with conventional 35mm film coverage, super wide angle lenses that you might own that you enjoyed and do not want to duplicate with an expensive wide angle lens for digital capture. But be aware there are differences in coverage and they are not always obvious. The 5D's super chip is terrific but it does not have as robust a body or as modern electronics as the newer D300. There always seem to be trade-offs. Please refer to the many positive Amazon reviews in the link to see why the 5D has also won many followers since 2005. Using your older film based lenses with your digital camera is advantageous regardless of the chip as long as you have coverage and quality.If you are already a Nikon user, note that the Nikon D300's chip like in the vast majority of cameras has a narrower coverage than the 5D and D3. Thankfully all Nikon lenses are backwards compatible with few caveats. Note that professional lenses tend to be larger, heavier and are more expensive but for good reasons like larger coverage, performance, speed and build such as the outstanding Nikon Zoom-Nikkor - Telephoto zoom lens - 70 mm - 200 mm - f/2.8 G ED-IF AF-S VR - Nikon AF-S. For most situations carrying gear, I like the trade off in the lighter weight DX lenses the D300 uses like the surprising performer for the cost Nikon 18-70mm f/3.5-4.5G ED IF AF-S DX Nikkor Zoom Lens. They suit the format's size and portability advantages that make them appealing where larger formats would be logistically problematic. However, if the full coverage sensor is critical you would need full coverage lenses and move up to the highly praised Nikon D3 12.1MP FX Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) which is three times the cost of a D300 (street price, with Nikon USA warranty). Moreover, you can spend even more on the equally excellent top of the line Canon EOS 1Ds Mark III 21.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only) or the first rate Fuijifilm camera, Fujifilm IS Pro Body Only, 12.3 MP Digital SLR Camera with Nikon F Lens Mount, with Pro Body Kit or the impressive, smallest mid-format camera, the Mamiya 645AFD III that is $10,000 (list).

The Nikon D300 has been the most cost effective way for a Nikon digital photographer to transition into many of the features of a professional-use camera.  Since its inception in the summer of 2007, the Nikon D300 has had some of its incredible feature set, like its 12.3mp CMOS sensor, re-appropriated into other less expensive models (D90, D5000; ok, actually they've modified the sensor slightly), and it has even been replaced with a slight upgrade, in the D300s.  However, this camera still remains an excellent choice for the photographer looking to either build a business or for a capable back-up model, and with the inevitable fall in its used price, due to the introduction of newer models, it looks to be an increasingly better value.It beats the Nikon D90 and D5000 in:1. Body build and weather sealing (ie. Magnesium Alloy vs. Hardened Plastic, Yes vs. No)2. 14-bit NEF vs. 12-bit NEF RAW3. Top Shutter Speed (1/8000 vs. 1/4000)4. Compact Flash Cards vs. SDHC5. Better AF Detection (51 points vs. 11)6. 100% Viewfinder vs. not7. Much larger buffer rate (99 vs 22)8. Ability to use older manual focus lenses with metering (also D5000 requires G lenses, or else focusing is all manual)9. Balances larger, heavier, pro lenses much better10. More of the controls are on the surface of the camera rather than hidden in sub-menus11. Shutter life (150, 000 clicks vs. 100,000 in D90, maybe less in D5000)Nikon D90 and D5000 beat it in:1. Slightly better sensor performance (a lot has been made about the subtle improvements made to the original sensor in the later bodies.  However, it should be noted that most of the online tests that you read are conducted in jpeg; this defaults the D300's sensor to 12-bit, same as the best capable in the D90 and D5000, in this case, the newer sensors edge it out.  Shooting the camera in 14-bit NEF improves its low-light  performance especially in controlling shadow noise, which what most of the tests measure.  In other words, the tests generally short-change the capability of the D300's sensor in favor of the newer models)2. Improved Live View3. Video Mode4. D5000 has a positionable LCD ScreenAnd that's just the surface.  If you've been contemplating buying one, the best time is when the used prices go down by about a third of the original MSRP (my experience anyway; you are more likely to get a camera still at the peak of its performance, without biting the bullet too much on cost).Best-Jason Gray[...].", "Date": "January 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera, far excedes Canon 5D/40D/50D", "Author": "J.

Have been disappointed lately in their offering, not to mention poor quality control and bad design decisions. People have been asking Canon for a weather sealed pro-sumer body w/ a pro-level AF system for many years and Canon has refused to make it, fearing it would cut into their 1 series sales. Even their 5D and 5D Mark II bodies, which they classify as professional, have a dummied down 9 point AF system and virtually no weather sealing. Numerous complains of it \"creaking\" when you grip it due to poor door design and being more easily damaged by moisture than other bodies. Recent complaints about mirrors falling out, filthy sensors on brand new cameras etc really make me wonder what is wrong w/ Canon and their quality control. When they added the stupid direct print button on the body (starting w/ the 30D) instead of making the body more robust and weather sealed and having a better AF system, I knew they were going down the wrong path. The one advantage Canon had over Nikon, until the introduction of the D3 and D300, was in high ISO image noise. Canon had the advantage until now and everyone agreed that Canon made better sensors and had a wider assortment of lenses but Nikon made much better bodies w/ pro features in the prosumer line. With Nikon's recent offerings, that no longer is true.Many of my friends have changed over to Nikon from Canon and every one was happy they did. I went to a local store and tried the D300 and was blown away. Wow, this is the Canon 3D/7D we've been asking for. Amazing camera and I realized then it was time to sell my Canon equipment and \"go to the dark side\". I did that and have no regrets. I purchased my D300 from Amazon and it arrived quickly and was flawless. And get this, I did a sensor dust test (Shoot grey/blue sky at F32 or as small as you can get, bring up the image in your editor and run auto levels on it) on my new D300. Not a speck of dust on the sensor. Perfectly clean. My Canon bodies always came w/ dirty sensors and one time it came back after servicing even dirtier than when it went in. The D300 was spotless. A real sign of good quality ... but then you know that the minute you pick up the body. I did a lot of research and picked up their highly rated 16-85 VR and 70-300 VR lenses and find them to be nearly as sharp as the Canon L lenses I used to own at about half the cost. Well done Nikon. I also have a D200 which is very close in features to the D300 (and quite a bit less money if you can find one on sale), but all in all, the D300 is my favorite camera and one that I will use for many years.

My previous main body was a Canon EOS 20D. I liked that camera, but had become frustrated by its small rear display and lack of a sensor dust-removal system. I have a collection of manual focus Nikkor lenses from my film days, and I tested the Nikon waters a few years ago by purchasing a D40 to experiment with those lenses. Using the manual lenses on the D40 was less than satisfactory (no metering), but I did find myself turning to the D40 regularly over the following months. I preferred its treatment of highlights and noise to that of the Canon - the Nikon approach to image processing undoubtedly results in a more \"film-like\" result.Anyway, back to the D300 - The display is gorgeous - HUGE compared to the Canon 20D. The image processing is superb: low noise until ISO 1600, but the noise that is there is not unpleasant (unlike the blotchy results I would get from the Canon at those speeds). The grip feels great in my hand. The viewfinder display is very usable. I don't find myself accidentally adjusting the exposure compensation as I often would on the Canon. Auto-bracketing: check.

The Nikon D300 is is a rugged camera with a magnesium alloy frame and a fair amount of weather/dust sealing. The ruggedness of this camera is apparent from the moment you first pick up to handle it. The controls and buttons are well placed and easy to use, and if you've used other Nikon DSLRs, you'll find the D300 controls quite familiar with few exceptions.At 12.3MP from it's DX sensor, the Nikon D300 offers crisp accurate colors and sharp detail that can't be found in the lower priced consumer level cameras. The quality is especially noticeable in less than perfect shooting conditions such as poorly lit situations, where the auto-focus performance coupled with usable images up to the ISO 3200 range. That's not to say the D300 doesn't have noise at it's higher ISO settings, it does, but the noise levels are much more acceptable than past offerings such as the D200 or D100 Nikon DLSRs. The Nikon D300 can be pushed right up to ISO 6400 though the noise starts getting very ugly in this range, but it can make the difference in getting the shot or going home empty-handed.With the Auto ISO feature, you can specify what ISO ranges you want the camera to work with, and what the slowest shutter speed is you want the camera to use before stepping up to a higher ISO level for you. This is especially helpful when photographing in fast-paced settings where you don't have time to fiddle with all the settings for a perfect exposure, the camera helps you get the shot faster, and gets you the proper exposure without dropping the shutter speed down into unacceptable ranges. I find this feature the most useful when shooting in aperture priority mode.Many people find the Nikon D300 doesn't produce the eye-popping photos they expect right out of the box, but one needs to bear in mind that the D300 isn't a consumer level camera, and shouldn't be expected to perform as one. It's definitely worth the time to learn how to properly use all the features this camera has to offer. The images from the D300 are at their best once you set the camera up to your own personal shooting style, and learn some good processing techniques in photo-processing software such as the excellent Nikon Capture NX2 or equally impressive Adobe Lightroom programs.The Multi-CAM 3500DX auto-focus system on the Nikon D300 is very impressive, and even in the lowest light settings, I've not had any problems with the D300 acquiring focus nearly instantaneously without having to resort to using the annoying focus-assist lamp which I keep turned off. The 51-point 3D focus tracking is especially impressive, and as to date it's been able to keep up with any demanding situation I've tasked it with such as indoor sporting events and night-time action photography.I could go on and on about all the countless features of the Nikon D300, but you can read about them easily enough in the product feature list, or the multitude of reviews that are nothing but rehashed feature lists with little insight offered into the actual functionality of those features. Suffice it to say, of all the features the Nikon D300 puts on the table, they all work with a level of precision that won't leave you disappointed. Once you take the time to learn to use all the features this camera has to offer, and how they work together, there's hardly a shooting situation you wouldn't be able to handle with this gem of a DX sensored DSLR.", "Date": "November 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Perfect sports shooter!", "Author": "James R.

The image quality in ideal situations might not be that different, but the HIGH ISO performance of the D300 is much better and the 6/FPS of the D300 make it entirely useful for action/sports/nature shots.  That is the main reason I upgraded, the D80's 3/FPS were not enough.Then there is the far, far superior auto-focus system on the D300.  The D300 focuses my Nikkor AF ED 80-200mm F2.8D lens faster than the D80 did making me not feel the need to upgrade to an AF-S lens in that zoom range.The build quality of the D300 is far superior to the D80 and the extra buttons and their placement make it a much more efficient camera to use, that is if you are constantly switching between AF-C and AF-S focus as well as single point and multi-point focus.  No annoying exposure dial to get accidentally moved while in your bag anymore either (sometimes on my D80 it would get accidentally moved from A-priority to M-priority and I wouldn't notice and my first few shots would just be white).Then there is the fact that the D300 uses compact flash cards which are more reliable than SDHC cards and far, far easier to handle as they are large and don't have exposed contact points.Then there is the other fact the D300's built-in flash can act as a commander to fire an off camera flash (like the SB-600/800/900) which is extremely useful and makes for infinite more flash opportunities right out of the box.Also, if you find the D80's LCD screen when reviewing shots to have lag when moving around and zooming into the photo, that is all gone in the D300.  That was one thing that really annoyed me about the D80, that lag.

With most other digital cameras that I have used the photos start noticeably coming apart at around 400 or 800 and  at higher ISO's  usually weren't acceptable  for printing larger prints.The Nikon D300 is solidly built and a joy to use.  There is a little bit of a learning curve..(the Manual is 461 pages long)...depending on your degree of photo expertise.  At this point in time I can't see myself buying any other camera for years to come.  As far as anything negative the only thing I can think of is that the camera is a little on the heavy side.  I did a lot of online research... reading testing and feedback reports... before I bought this camera.  In all cases the Nikon D300 received high marks.", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worth every penny", "Author": "Busy Executive", "ReviewID": "R35PS3BAL9060N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Others have covered the basics, so let me just say that this camera simply helps me take better pictures than any other camera I've owned, period.Yes, there are lots of cool features that do all sorts of wonderful things, but at the end of the day, I seem able to take my D300 out with a few of my favorite lenses, and even just walking around town, I always come back with at least a few gallery-grade shots. Between the camera's capabilities and the comfortable controls, it just always seems to be ready to do exactly what I have in mind, and my results show it.I tried the 18-200 zoom, but wasn't impressed - I found it a bit soft. The 16-85 has become my favorite \"walk around\" lens, supplemented by the magnificent 70-200 2.8, the 10.5 fisheye and the 60 micro. Together, these give me about all the options I'd want, and the whole thing fits in a backpack style case.Don't forget to buy large (8GB) memory cards...they fill faster than you might think, especially if you choose the option of shooting raw (NEF) and JPEG at the same time - that's nearly 20mb per picture.Also don't overlook the very good Nikon Capture NX2 software that comes with the camera. I have Photoshop and lots of other applications, but while Capture NX2 isn't as flexible as Photoshop, it also seems somehow a lot simpler to go from the idea I have in my head to a finished print in my hands.Only minor gripe I have is with battery life...I find that on my typical mix of flash and non-flash shots, reviewing images on the built-in screen and so on, I get about 150-200 shots per battery charge. I have a few spare batteries, but perhaps it's a reason to buy the add-on grip.Bottom line is that the D300 has proven to easily be the best thing I've done in a long, long time to improve my photography.", "Date": "August 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nikon D300 the best you can get!", "Author": "Gentoo", "ReviewID": "RDUXF6RQ83LKA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered my D300 on July 24th of this year after reading hundreds of reviews on Amazon, Adorama, Ritz, Newegg, Ken Rockwell and others. Every once in a while, Nikon will produce something that it's users absolutely fall in love with. In the entry level market, it's the D40. At the advanced level it was the D70. In the high end market, the one between the advanced and professional market which only Nikon has established, it's is the D300! Many try to compare the D300 with Cannon's 40D. No, the 40D is not in the D300 class, it's better compared with the Nikon D80. There's a reason the D80 and 40D are around the same price and are 600 dollars cheaper than the D300.I moved up from a D40 which I only shot with for about 7 or 8 months. Often there is a learning curve spoken of, this depends on your current shooting style and can be either steep and challenging or shallow and easy. Because of the way I shoot with my D40, this learning curve was easy for me. I never use any preset modes or dummy (auto) mode. I always shoot in manual or shutter priority. If this is your style then you will love the D300. It has no preset modes and no auto mode so it is not for anyone looking to get their first DSLR.Much has been made in these reviews about all the technical things this camera can do. While one cannot speak of this camera without mentioning them, I will do my best to explain briefly at least two of them and when to use them for those who may not be familiar with them.1.Active D-Lighting (Adaptive Dynamic Range) is great for contrasting subjects or environments. It subtly brings up dark shadows to enhance detail while controlling the bright areas to preserve highlights. It should be turned off however if there is little contrast in the composition as it can sometimes cause focusing errors. For example, a brown bird on a brown background which is almost camouflaged. Active D Lighting in this situation may cause the camera to focus on the ground instead of the bird. There are four settings for it; low, normal, high and off. You will need to experiment to see which settings suit your taste.2. You can get up to 51 points of focus including 51 point 3D tracking focus. The latter of these is useful when tracking a soccer player across a field with other players running in front and behind him/her constantly or tracking a bird moving through the branches of trees. Normal 51 point focus is good for wider shots and you will only see the focus points when they light up after pushing the shutter release half way. Lets say you're trying to get a flock of birds or something; then you might want to switch to the 11 points of focus as these are spaced wider in the frame allowing you to capture more widely scattered subjects. 9 focus points are good for close ups and portraits that you want centered in the frame. For wildlife photographers like myself, the 21 focus points are good as that allows you to fill most of the frame with the subject in focus. The final mode of focus is continuous which is selected by a switch on the left front of the camera and one which, if you're like me with a large hand and long fingers, may accidentally change your focus mode because it can get in the way when you have long fingers. This mode focuses continually, allowing you to track birds in flight. On the back is another focus related switch that selects the focus points used. At the top is a rectangle thats pretty much an automatic selection of the 51 focal points. Most of the time it selects the right ones but not if you're doing wildlife shoots. As any wildlife shooter knows, cameras can have the tendency to focus on the wrong thing. This mode is best not used for wildlife. In the middle is another selection that shows a small square with with small dots on all four sides of it encompassed by brackets. This will use either the focus points you preselect in the menus (9, 11,21 or 51).If this is used with the S on the front switch it will actually move the center point anywhere around the frame as the subject moves. This it will do only if you've selected the S (for single) on that switch in the front..The selection on the bottom looks like the previous one without the small dots. That selects a single focus point.  That S tells the camera to only use one focus point. That switch can also be set to M for full manual focus. This Explanation of focus is somewhat oversimplified but it will give you a good starting point when dealing with the focusing of this great camera.I could go on about the technical aspects of this camera but that would indeed take a few days to write! I will tell you that once you have this camera in your hands, you will never want to put it down, seriously. I love my D40, I haven't used it though since I got my D300. If you have the money to get one, don't wait for a better deal, just go out and buy one and start shooting with it today. I got mine in advance of the fall and winter migrant birds I like to shoot arriving in Southern California. I wanted to get a good feel for this camera. Everything on this camera works beautifully.I never even went into the color and white balance selections as other reviewers have done a great job of that already.I will be updating this review as time passes.

I have been an advanced amature and avid Nikon user for many years. The D300, simply put, is not only the best camera I have ever owned, it is the best value.The D300, of course, includes many improvements from previous digital Nikon SLRs which it shares with the D3. Some of these improvements are incremental, others are much more useful for people who really care about their photography. These include the new processing system for exposure, the new 51 point AF system, and especially the greater flexibilty in the D300 for modifying color saturation and gamma values. This allows much more flexibility for creativity than for previous Nikons I have owned before. For example, setting the color saturation for vivid with a plus 2 or 3 value allows me to take photographs with much deeper color on the D80 or the D200. In addtion, the gamma control allows manipulation of overall tint without the need for having to purchase a range of color filters. The advanced focusing system really comes in handy when photographing moving subjects either in performance or sports.At perhaps a third of the price of the D3, and sharing most of it's features (with the exception of having a full-frame sensor) the D300 is a tremendous value and offers entry into professional photographic equipment with advanced capablity at a relatively low price.

After going through several point and shoot cameras (e.g., Canon G1 and Nikon 8800), I decided to jump into the D-SLR market.  I don't believe I had a preference for Canon vs. Nikon vs. Olympus, etc.  The reason why I picked the Nikon D300 is because it felt great in my hand plus the functionality is somewhat similar to my Nikon 8800...also the reviews on the D300 are stellar.I have not been disappointed so far.  This camera is solid all around.After taking some digital photography classes at the local reseller, I've taken this camera on nature hikes (for nice landscape shots) and fast action shots (college sporting events like tennis).  In both situations, the D300 along with the Nikon 18-200mm VR lens that I used on both occasions produced excellent shots.  The multi battery pack (MB- D10) gave me the adequate fps to shoot fast moving college tennis players with no problem.  The photos are crisp and clear.  I've also taken indoor shots of my dogs and used the same lens and camera along with the SB-800 and the shots were also crips and clean.Again, I would highly recommend this camera for those who want to step up from a point and shoot or from an entry level D-SLR.  The reason why I jumped straight into tha \"semi-pro\" D-SLR like the D300 is because friends of mine who purchased an entry level D-SLR often wished they had ponied up more money and bought a D-SLR with more features (actually lack of fast fps was often cited as a complaint).", "Date": "April 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best camera I have ever owned", "Author": "Barbara Karpp \"Garf68\"", "ReviewID": "R2RQB19UTFEZO5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always been a Nikon person and having this camera shows me why I love Nikon so much.

Marsh \"Dr Naud\"", "ReviewID": "R3C312JUGM7ZFZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a Canon user for over 15 years, I have shot on many cameras including Nikon, Olympus and Sony, but still I believed that the Canons (specifically the 5D and the 1D MkII) are/were the pinnacle of camera design and image quality that I have used.Needless to say that opinion has now changed, for how long I can't be sure, but believe me when I say that it is tough not to give the camera five stars.Superb build, ergonomics, image quality and the sheer amount of features put many other cameras to shame. There are a few features I would like to pull out for special attention that really sealed the deal; 3D Matrix Metering II and automatic in camera CA elimination (not just reduction, but elimination). Now I love my 17-55mm f2.8, but when it comes to CA it leaves a lot to be desired... Until now. JPEG's are simply amazing with the CA elimination, not to mention the active D-lighting (if you wish to have the benefits of these features for NEF files you HAVE to use Nikon's Capture NX, but more on that later).The Matrix Metering used in this camera is the best I've used bar none, it is extremely accurate and it really will make you a better photographer (or some say a lazier photographer, lol).I don't have to say much about the image quality of the D300, there are plenty of examples floating around the net, suffice to say it is very, very good.Now, I do have a negative. Capture NX. It is a resource hog, also in my subjective opinion it can be an unintuitive nightmare. That doesn't mean that the images that it produces aren't any good, in fact they're great, if you want the most out of the camera (CA elimination and Auto D-Lighting) you will need capture NX. I also use Lightroom, Apple Aperture and Adobe RAW, oh how I wish that I could tap the CA and D-Lighting in those programs - it would mean that I could avoid Capture NX completely. But I can't.Now there are some around here who would toss irrelevant comments at me for such a knock (Capture NX is free! or some such nonsense), but the reality is that many don't own an application such as Aperture or Lightroom, they really need this software to get the most from their camera purchase, which is not an insignificant dollar amount. I thank Nikon for finally realizing that Capture should come bundled with it's camera, but there is still some work to be done regarding it's performance in terms of speed of use and it's huge resource requirements. As a serious photographer I can't bear the thought of the horrendous time wasted waiting for changes to occur to my image in NX, but when some of the cameras best features will only be achieved through NX, it seems I don't have a choice.I was tempted to drop the rating to four stars because of the software, considering I can't do four point five stars; but A)It's harsh on the camera, and B)Giving the camera four stars is like bait to the Nikon fanboys, if you don't believe me look at some of the flaming in those four star reviews.

Had to be sent out to replace that multi-pin housing. Took it to Hunts who sent it to Precision (check the internet).  Hunts told me that a week does not pass without a pin-damaged camera (all brands....Canon too) coming through the door.....usually a couple of cameras a week.  Lesson: Don't be in a rush when you seat those memory cards...either into the computer or the camera.  Deliberately insert the card, gradually sliding it until it makes contact.  Maybe wriggle it to and fro just a bit when it makes contact.  Only then do I give it the final push to \"seat\" it.While I am updating....the more my D300 shows wear from my handling it.........the more I like it.  I keep the MB-D10 permanently attached....almost, i.e. there are times when compactness is a premium (such as when I am on a bike).  This is when it is nice to be able to remove the MB-D10.

The tolerances are so close that it is difficult to close and seal.  However, when I finally do get it sealed.......it is sealed.  I do admire the manufacturers/designers for making it seal so tightly.  Picky, picky, picky.I doubt I will give up my D300.....EVAH!My next body is a D3S or the pro body that replaces the D3S.

I WANTED the D300, but didn't NEED the D300.It all started one day when I started planning a trip to Florida ... sort of. I typically go out weekends to TRY and relax taking pictures. I'm new to this, so I spend a lot of time, but no where near enough time, shooting and learning to get the most out of the D200. Now I'm sure it's me and not the camera, but many of my shots were on the darkside (light - dark), so I was spending a fair amount of time dealing with this in PS, iPhoto and Aperture. Was this because I'm color blind, who knows, but it was an issue (for me). In any case, the D300 was announced and Nikon said it was a much better camera (surprise?). Well with my upcoming trip, I decided to see if I could sell my D200, and then get a D300 and cross my fingers.Well I sold the D200 on a Monday, order my new D300 from B&H; Tuesday, got it here on that Friday, got it together, tried it, loaded in the car, and left for Florida.Well I took a few pictures on the way down, and read the book quickly (my first mistake), so I would be better prepared when I arrived in Florida.Florida is about a 22 - 26 hour drive from Maine, so it didn't give me much time to play or read before I got there, but I was hoping enough. After all it was only an up-grade to a camera I had been using for some time now.WOW, I took 25 +- pictures at a wonderful park across the street from the hotel I was staying, and ALL of the pictures were wonderful!

I began with the Coolpix 775 and worked my way through affordable iterations of this product line until I purchased the D40x and plunged into the world of dSLR, as Nikon makes it, opening great vistas for me.  A year later, I purchased the D80 from a fellow shooter (one I've teamed up with during all these years) who bought the D300 last year.The D80 was more than adequate to my needs, but from our first wildlife shoot together, I heard the shutter click on my friend's D300 at near the speed of light (6fps, not even the 8fps the D300 can produce with a battery pack) and I reasoned that my 3.5fps was still not too shabby, even though my friend was breaking down water bird take offs into micro-slices, from my perspective with the D80.  What sealed the deal was the resolution quality at ISO 1600 that made dusk shooting possible with noise under reasonable control with some Imagenomic Noiseware and CS3 magic in the digital darkroom.  I now shoot as high as ISO 1250 and can do post-processing in Noiseware and CS4 with very pleasing results.The D300 offers more camera control than I've needed thus far, but the ability to set up 4 banks of shooting personal menus is very, very powerful and makes getting for your favorite types of shooting (wildlife, landscape, people, low-light, etc.) a simple selection in the \"Shooting Menu Bank,\" in the camera's main menu.  Remember, I've only opened the box on this piece of elegant machinery, having owned it since the middle of November this year.I recommend the D300 to any enthusiast/semi-pro shooter that is interested in taking their game to a whole new level of photography not available in less of a camera.  I won't kid you, this is what I had to sell my D80 and pull some savings to get, but I'm very pleased with this camera and it's multitude of possibilities.  You won't be disappointed.I bought through Amazon and free-shipped to save a bit of money.  As has been my experience with them, this one was on par with their keeping their promises.Caveats:  Not for the \"auto-shoot\" player.  Not for someone starting out in the world of dSLR (the D40 is the camera to cut your teeth with, or even a used D40x, both make great photography possible).  Research your needs on line.  A man who shoots both Canon and Nikon has some very clear reviews on any camera from these manufacturer's-Ken Rockwell, Google it and you'll get to his site.  Finally, if $ is no problem and you've got some dSLR under your belt, you're already shooting with the advanced models or looking for a less expensive path to excellence in photography, this camera will perform above your expectations.I hope you enjoy yours as much as I am mine.", "Date": "December 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nikon D300", "Author": "Janice", "ReviewID": "R2AOQYFZQR1D4V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a Nikon D200 for two years and this camera is definitely a step up.

I am very impressed with the wide exposure latitute this camera offers (if I use that term correctly having used film SLRs since 1971).  The noise reduction is as good as they said it would be.  I was concerned about that due to Nikon's reputation for not having the best noise reduction in its DSLRs of the past.  This camera handles it well.The 3 inch monitor is wonderful unless you're in bright sunlight.  My only criticism of the camera is that I find myself looking at my own reflection rather than the image I have just taken.I recently took my wife's portrait because she needed an 8X10 for a head shot.  The best frame turned out to be a horizontal one and I cropped it quite a bit to get a vertical print.

I've been shooting mine for a few months now and I love it (bought it used/refurb at Fred Miranda's).I'm really not much of a brand fanboy, having shot Pentax and Canon also, but overall I'm pleased with the D300.  I'll list some pros and cons:-----Pros:+ Good control scheme.  I found I liked it better than Canon 40D, but not as good as the Pentax K20D.  Most of your most important functions are found on external controls or customizable (to a degree) butttons.+ Good image quality, especially with good glass and shooting technique.  This is true of many cameras, though.  I do like the D300 jpeg output, though...pretty nice+ Nice build quality.  Everything feels secure, no flexing, etc.  I have not shot with the camera in very cold weather.  I have encountered no serious problems or worries with the camera.+ Flash commander is nice, lots of AF options are nice, lens tuning if you need it, great high-res screen on the back.  The AF is great once you learn the nuances of the various modes.+ Customizable shooting banks and a custom menu.+ autoISO is awesome and trounces Canon's implimentation.+ A great 100% viewfinder.+ Camera seems pretty darn accurate at matrix metering.----------------Now, some cons:- The rear control pad doesn't have a seperate, raised \"enter\" button like the D90 does -- you have to press/click the entire pad down -- sometimes this results in you accidentally pressing (left  or right) instead of the click.  Not a huge problem - I learned to just click->right through menus, as it acts like an \"enter\" press.- Noise is pretty good, but don't expect miracles -- You need good exposure for high ISO.  If you want to shoot in darker scenes with great high ISO, get a D700.  The D300 is good, but frankly I can't tell a huge difference between its noise performance and the 40D, especially in prints.  I generally try to keep ISO maxed at 800, unless I know I'm gettling decent light, then I'll hit around 2000 max.It's a good camera, but don't expect noise miracles.- There is no option to press \"Fn\" and return immediately to the top-level item in \"My Menu\", unlike the D90.  Minor quibble.- It's not free :-)There's really a lot to like about the D300, and very little to dislike.  The rear pad click is probably the most annoying because you run into it all the time, but it's only a real problem when you don't use right-click as your enter key.Otherwise, great camera.  I hope it lasts me many years.", "Date": "March 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Image-maker par excellence, the Nikon D300", "Author": "Richard P. Lussier", "ReviewID": "RZVGYNWGQS2S4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using Nikon DSLR's since 2005 for my \"paying hobby\".  Officially, I created a photography side-business in early 2005 using a Nikon D70s (great camera).  This was after a couple of years of ramping up my photography interests from an occasional point-and-clicker to a very serious hobbyist.  I very quickly upgraded to the D200 (better camera), using the D70s as a backup.  And, in early 2008 upgraded to the D300 (best camera), selling the D70s , leaving the D200 as my backup.  I've captured around 15000 images with the D200, and am currently up to about 8000 clicks with the D300.  I shoot all types of photography:  wildlife, landscape, portraitature, architectural, wedding & other misc. events.  I do not consider myself a Pro (only about 10% of my current income comes from photography), but I would like it to evolve into my full time career, someday. :)In my opinion, the Nikon D300 is easily Nikon's best DX format (not comparing to FX formats, like the D700, etc.) DSLR out to date.  And, currently, the best in its class compared to other brands.  Please keep in mind that the latter statement (my opinion) is only based on much reading-on & a little hands-on experience with some of the rivaling Canon DSLR's.  I am not discounting Canon's great line of photographic equipment (or other brands) at all, just comparing current models with closely related price range and feature set.  As a matter of fact, to this day, I still advise all who ask that since the quality of the top brands is so close, that the most important thing to do before making a decision on your first DSLR purchase is to personally handle several models of several brands, and choose the one most comfortable and easiest to understand; it's all about individual user preference.  I DO tell them that I am MOST familiar with the Nikon line, and will be better able to \"assist\" them, if they get Nikon.Here are a few features that I find useful and that I have not found repeated hundreds of times over in hundreds of other reviews (like excellent focusing, vivid colors, noise handling, etc.): - One of the in-camera editing tools, the Crop tool, allows me to simulate a 4x5 crop (8x10) when taking group portraits.  This enables me to make sure that I'm not cutting off people parts when clients will invariably order 8x10's of large group shots.  I wish the largest cropping boundary would start at the outer most edge of the image, but that's really nit picking a good feature. - The D-light edit allows me to quickly see how an image looks with the shadows brightened up a bit, even though I only shoot RAW.  I will end up deleting this jpg copy when I copy images to the PC, and post-edit the exposure, but I can immediately see if the image still looks good with a brighter exposure adjustment. - The My Menu feature is GREAT for quickly accessing my most accessed settings.  With the latest firmware update, you have a choice to use the My Menu or a Recent tab (like the D200 has).Little things about the D300 that are different from the D200 (that haven't been mentioned hundreds of times): - D300 Command and Sub dials are more recessed in, so they are not as easy to accidentally spin. - The D300 lens mount seems to lend a tighter connection. - The D300 shutter release sounds \"tighter\", does not have the slight echo/vibration sound at the end of the click, like the D200 does. - One small feature that I actually do NOT like better on the D300 is the highlights display feature.  It blinks on the most uncluttered display page, not on the cluttered data page that has the image as a thumbnail, but that's nit-picking really.Another good thing is that I'm not at all tempted to upgrade since the D700 would mean getting at least two more fast/pro lenses to take advantage of the full size sensor, leaving all but one of my lenses (Nikon 70-200 2.8 VR \u00a1V beautiful lens!!) \"out of the picture\" (I know that I could still use them at 5 megapixels, but that doesn't count for me).  And, I don't need the video feature of the D700 at all.  The D700's much better noise handling at high ISO's would be nice, but the D300's noise handling works really well with 99% of my shots.  In fact, thanks to the D700, at least in part, the price of the D300 is much more affordable!Also, I highly recommend David Busch's Nikon D300 Guide book.  I was very familiar with Nikon DSLR's already, but his book really helped fill in the gaps, and helped me take advantage of all of the D300's excellent features.The photographer IS still the most important part of the image capturing equation, but I truly believe that overall the D300 delivers better looking images than the D200, and all earlier DSLR models (even considering identical lens, technique, and minor settings differences to take advantage of individual camera body's features), and is well worth the extra expense of a new body purchase.", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Magnifcent upgrade from D70s", "Author": "D.

There are not enough words to describe the completeness, quality, or flexibility the D300 proffers advanced amateur photographers. What prompted me most to make the leap is the video tutorial on Nikon's web site. And it only scratches the surface of the feature-richness of this marvel of cameras. My favorite (though there are many) is the ability to customize all the settings to fit four different scenarios. For instance, if I go from shooting a landscape to shooting flash, I can instantly switch to all the settings I want for flash photography by making just one menu selection. A corollary to that is all the custom settings can be saved to a .bin file on your computer. So you go out in the field, fiddle with everything, come back and reload ALL your default customizations in a matter of minutes. If you take the plunge, you may want do what I did: I got Thom Hogan's \"Complete Guide to the D300\" and religiously went through it step by step--all 790 pages.

Don't go buying 3rd party lenses w/ speeds slower then 2.8.  Pro Nikon lenses can be had fairly cheap. (prime lenses, and USED pro glass is the way to go for those who can't afford the big guns) I purchased a used mint cond. nikon 35-70mm 2.8D for $275, a new 50mm 1.4D for $280, and a Sigma 10-20mm for $460.  50mm 1.8 can be had for around $100 - so like I said great lenses can be had for less then you think. If you want a top notch zoom find a used Nikon 80-200mm 2.8D - they go for around $700 used and mint condition and are considered one of the best zooms ever made.  In other words DON'T put cheap bridgstone tires on a Ferrari.  The lens is every bit as important as the camera.Also if you like doing portraits invest in a nikon flash (for the amature the SB600 will do you good, for the advanced amature or pro the SB800 is the flash you want.)  The on board flash is OK for party pics but if you want first class portraits then get the flash.

I'm a budding photographer and have worked with a couple of Nikon D60 cameras. They served me well but as I progressed, I felt I needed a more professional camera. I didn't want to spend a boat load of money on a camera body since I had just spent some good cash on a 70-200mm F/2.8 lens. I looked at the new Nikons and although they are good, they are also still very very expensive (so that ruled out the D700/D800.)  The cameras I then started considering were used D7100 and a D300. My local camera shop had a used D300 body only camera on sale for under five hundred dollars and it came with a 1 year warranty from the camera shop. I asked for the shutter count and it was only 18400 so I jumped at that. I tried it out at the camera shop with one of their lenses and it looked and felt really good in my hands and every button seemed to be in the right place so you could make changes. I immediately noticed it was a professional camera. It is weather sealed so every port on it has a rubber cap. The shutter made a professional sound and didn't sound anything like the D40/D60 cameras. (I hear the D60 doesn't have a real shutter and it was more of a slider or something.)I took it home and used my 50mm f/1.8 lens and snapped some photos to verify everything worked and the shutter count was what they said it was. The photos so far from this camera are outstanding. The focus is superb!! For those of you who don't know, the D300 has a 51point focusing system just like the high end Nikon cameras. If you're upgrading I would definitely recommend this camera even used. There are alot of really good deals on these used on Amazon, craigs, or ebay and the camera is totally professional; magnesium-alloy body and weather sealed!

It thought it was a great camera, and I still do. As this is not a detailed review of the camera, I would like to comment on a few things that have struck me while using it.I'm very satisfied with the metering system. I have taken pictures under challenging lighting conditions, and after having reviewed the picture on the LCD I changed the exposure. However, after downloading the pictures to my computer it turns out that the camera has been right more often then I. Therefore, my trust in the metering system has increased. (I believe this has occurred because the LCD has been hard to view properly in the given lightning conditions, and not because the LCD is bad).Having 51 auto focus points to choose from can seem a bit excessive, but it's something I really appreciate. Now I can compose the pictures as I like and then choose where the camera should focus, instead of having to re-frame after having focused first. This leads to a more precise focusing. Also, the \"intelligent\" mode where the camera chooses witch points to focus at is very good. It doesn't work all the time, but more often than not.Having a high-res LCD is great! You can zoom in closely to check focus, and it is in general great for reviewing your pictures. This is, objectively, one of the very best LCDs on the market.There are some software issues that could be better. For instance, I would like the auto iso-function to turn off when setting the camera to manual exposure mode. Not a big deal, but a bit annoying.I also miss a fast way of changing picture controls. An easy way to fix this would be to enable the Fn-button to do it. I hope this will come in a future firmware update.Why not buy a D300? Well, I think there are two main reasons. The first one is the D90 and the second one is the D700. The D90 has much of the same technology as the D300, but comes at a lower price. You won't get 51 auto focus points or a rock solid magnesium house, but do you need that? The D700 is the D300's big brother. It has a full frame sensor, but apart from that is is very similar to the D300.Would I buy the D300 today? I'm not sure. Don't get me wrong; I love my camera, but as I'm single and in a good job I would probably go for the D700 instead. And if you have been stup.... if you're married with kids, maybe the cheaper D90 would suit your needs sufficiently.", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent all-around digital body", "Author": "Jim Gerdy \"jjg\"", "ReviewID": "R25OT221Q6AOSI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There have been ample reviews, mostly positive, written for this all-around high-quality body since it was first introduced in 2008. I bought one right away as my first digital camera after hanging on to film well into the digital era.I want to comment one of the weaker aspects of this body (and lens lineup) and my main use, that is low-light photography. My previous film experience was with cameras well suited for low light, Leica rangefinders and a Rollei twin-lens. Over my first two years with my Nikon D300 I have used it extensively with high-speed prime lenses, mostly the Nikon 50mm f/1.4, often wide open. And I have often been disappointed by the Nikon seeming to miss focus, even when the subject is stationary.In comparison to the old rangefinders (my main user was a 1948 vintage Leica IIIc) I would say my Nikon misses focus (at wide aperture) more than 50% of the time. While with my older cameras I would put my focusing success at near 100%. With the split image rangefinders or the large and clear screen on the Rollei TLR I rarely missed, even on moving subjects. So I would rate the low-light focusing of the Nikon inferior to the older technology. Nevertheless the lens if very sharp. And for the photos that are in focus the effect is perfect. I can get selective focus and blur the background with f/1.4 and f/2 at close distances.While I have some nostalgia for the older technology, with more accurate focusing, I am overall quite satisfied with the D300. Of course just being digital gives it considerable advantage. Even when focusing is an issue I take so many more photos that after some selection I can get as many well composed ones from the Nikon as I did with film. And I see the results right away.I would also comment that for very shallow depth of focus (as you get with a 50 f/1.4 at close distance) the very focusing mechanism in the D300 may not be adequate to focus perfectly all the time. I do not know the internals of the camera. But the issue may be that the gearing of the focusing within the camera body is not fine enough to step precisely enough. The lenses dedicated to the digital format (which Nikon calls \"G\" lenses) have focusing motors within the lens which may be more precise than the body's own motor. I haven't tried these lenses for intermediate focal lengths.My final criticism is that these \"G\" prime lenses and the smaller sensor of the D300 (compared with 35mm film dimensions) leaves odd gaps in the focal length selection. The current prime lens lineup is biased to the telephoto side. Sigma seems to be making up the difference to an extent. But we maybe without a good high-speed wide and ultrawide \"G\" lineup (such as Leica has long offered with its M cameras).", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome for an advanced amateur", "Author": "R.

I couldn't really find any drawbacks to this camera and I'm thoroughly impressed by the quality, intuitive and abilities.  I upgraded from a Nikon D70s looking for more options and more program flexibility.  I bought Brouche's book to go with the camera and have spent about a day reading and learning about all the functions and customizing just about everything you can imagine.  It takes time to customize the camera in order to truly take advantage of the price and features.  After taking a few sample pictures, I'm very happy with my purchase.  Once you read about the functions, you are good to go and it actually does help you become a better photographer as you have more control and input on your picture taking.  If you are looking for a simple to use point and shoot and let the camera do all the thinking - it's great but overkill.  You could get away with a D80 or D90 and save some money.  But if you want full customization, endless programming options and a \"heavy thinking camera\" you won't be let down.  Amazon had a great price on it and I bought it with a Nikon 17-55 mm lens which I'm sure impacts my picture quality.

Although it's the same resolution as the D2x, it's focusing system is superior.  The only place the D3 rivals the D300 is in ISO and frame rate, which is over rated (no pun intended).  Photographers can capture better images with well planned 6 fps than will sloppy 9 fps any day!Then there's the weight issue.  I've developed carpel tunnel from using my D2x cameras constantly all day long 6 days a week with big heavy lenses.  It will be a treat to use these little guys.The popup flash has commander mode which will free up one of my SB 800 units so I can add it to my army of SB 800 flashes that accompany me to all my shoots.  And it will be nice to not have to constantly cary a flash on my camera all the time.One note on resolution.  The D300's 12 megapixel sensor has 32,823 pixels / mm which means it has a higher resolution than the Canon 1Ds Mark III which has 21 megapixels at 24,336 ppmm by almost 10,000 pixels / millimeter.  It's because of the size of the sensor.  The Canon however has a larger print resolution because it has more pixels, but because the Nikon has a higher sensor resolution it makes inherently sharper images (especially since you can shoot 14 bit now), so you can make larger enlargements with the Nikon than the Canon's enlargements.  This all really makes no difference however because what is acceptable resolution for enlarged prints is wholly subjective and not able to be quantified as it is based solely on the viewer preference and distance from print!  Bottom line resolution doesn't matter!  But if you're hung up on Megapixels just know that this one has a higher sensor resolution than even the $8,000 Canon!This camera is an amazing buy and that's probably why the D3 isn't selling like I would have expected.

Controls are perfectly spaced and in the right places, 6 Frames per second is fast but add the MB-D10 grip and you get 8 frames per second.  It's been great not just for sports but also photographing children on the go.  Thanks to Nikons picture control system adding different profiles to the camera or sharing with other photographers is a snap.  i'd also recommend the mb-d10 grip as it balances out the camera and just feels right.  there just seems to be something missing without it.  not to mention the ability to power the camera from AA batteries rather than 40 dollar EN-EL3e batteries.  For $20 you can buy Energizer 2500mah NiMH batteries which last longer than the 1500mah lithium ion batteries.  HDMI output is nice but have only used it to test it.  Live view is great for the strange tight spots photographers sometimes find them in.  i've used it to take pictures over the heads of other people in crowds or while setting the camera on my shoe but didn't want to smash my face into the ground to look through the viewfinder.  the shutter release takes a little getting used to and expect to occasionally snap two shots while in Ch mode (highspeed).  the high iso performance is great however if you are looking for unbelievable high iso performance look at the D3.

Active D-lighting is nice and the color space adds depth and saturation to the images.  Speed is incredible: 2.5fps in RAW, 6fps in TIFF or JPG Fine/Large.  Live view is easier to use than the manual makes it out to be, and a nice addition for tripod/studio work (no kneeling or step stool to run the camera when its mounted.)  My Menu personalization is great...I can pick the features I use the most, put them in one place and organize them how I want.  No more digging through 4 pages of CSM to change the self timer etc.The not quite as good:I don't care for the release mode dial...a bit hard to manipulate using one hand with the lock, but it did not take much to get used to it.Software wise...Capture NX is good, but cumbersome to use.  My advice is use it if it is free, but if you already have PS Lightroom or CS3 they are still the better choice.  Capture NX and Camera Control are nice for the camera enhancements they add, but I am not sure how much I will use them.Of course the price is high as is the price for almost all accessories (hence the 4 stars vice 5), but you get what you pay for.

I had a D70 (which I just sold) and loved it to death (I hate to have given it up), but my failing vision forced me into the D300.

A beginner will get better looking shots from a D40 than a D300 until the learning curve is overcome- Be prepared to drop $$$ for good lenses. This camera doesn't reach its full potential until you put some fast lenses on it (anything f /2.8 or better). You will need to buy a good flash (SB600 or 800) and the remote cord.

The issue is serious and what we can hope for is a firmware update as opposed to sending the camera in for repair.Edit (07/01/08): Nikon just released a firmware update which is supposed to fix the DBS issue. The whole point is moot now but it seems impossible to change the rating.Side note: The new FX format D700 is announced.Edit (07/19/08): The firmware results are not all in yet.

It may seem like I was jumping in feet first by purchasing such a complicated camera, but with over 30 years of photo experience under my belt it really wasn't all that difficult.I am quite satisfied with my D300, especially with its 51 point focus zone that allows me to pinpoint exactly where I want the focus.  I initially had some problems with exposure, but as it turned out I was the one making the errors, not the camera, so that is now water under the bridge.So far my only serious gripe about the D300 is the arrangement of its controls. While I fully realize that this is a very complex camera, and there is only so much room on the body for control buttons, some of them are very badly placed.  I have missed several photo opportunities because I didn't have my finger on the shutter button, but on either the on/off switch, or the exposure control button, which are placed right next to it.  A lot of times my photography requires literal snap shots, with little or no time to pause and gaze at the camera to make sure I have my fingers in exactly the right place. It's point, shoot, or lose the photo.  Fixing this problem doesn't even require moving any of the buttons; Nikon should have made the shutter button  more prominent, or different in a tactile sense so that the moment you touch it, you know you are in the right place, and that's actually what I've gone and done.  I found some small self adhesive vinyl plastic nubbins and stuck one of them atop the shutter button, making it much more obvious, and I haven't lost a shot since, but considering the price of this camera I shouldn't have to be doing stuff like this.", "Date": "April 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Upgraded from D200", "Author": "T.

It's an excellent camera all around, and surpasses the D3 and D700 for use in nature photography, one of the pluses of the non-full-size sensor (greater reach with your lenses.) Since I use this mainly for nature shots, I wouldn't have traded it even for a D3 (unless someone threw in one of Nikon's big telephoto primes.)  But, alas, the shutter failed only a few weeks after the one-year warranty expired, and far short of the 150000 shutter clicks the shutter is supposed to be good for.  I have no idea whether this failure occurred due to an engineering flaw or random chance.  But a fairly pricey prosumer camera that breaks after a year of normal use is unreliable.The D300s is supposedly more or less identical except in its video capabilities, which will put even more strain on a badly designed shutter, so I would guess that unreliability will be a problem with the D300s as well.  That's just a guess. But the D300 camera should have lasted longer without breaking.Update:  I neglected to edit this review to reflect Nikon's response when I complained, which was that they agreed to fix it for less than the original price they gave me for repairs.

Why did Nikon ever go with a non-standard dial on top of the camera. I can never turn it as easily as the normal dial. Their button and dial approach to changing between P, M, A is just awkward. I do not want to look at the LCD just to change my mode. Their hand grip is also off. I have no place to put my thumb. The grip on the Canon 40D is much better, a nice solid grip and feel.The Canon 40D also seems much easier to use. The 40D has a normal dial on top, all the menus are only 1 deep and you never need to navigate a complex menu structure. Very nice and quick to use. All the buttons are easy to memorize. I rarely have to take my eye away from the viewfinder. Plus I save $700 for basically the same image quality and dynamic range.The 40D even has a lower noise rating between ISO 100-400. Which is important to me. But it was surprising to learn that since the Nikon cost $700 more and the Nikon has lower noise ratings above that ISO range. I guess they had to skimp on the lower ISOs to reach 6400. This is according to popphoto.Here are some more surprising finds. When the D300 is in 14-bit capture mode the shutter speed reduces to a max of 2.5 fps. The 40D remains fast at 6.5 fps in 14-bit mode. And the usable dynamic range of the D300 at ISO 100 is only 8.5 EV. The 40D has a better usaable range of 9.1 EV at ISO 100. Which will be useful for photos requiring high dynamic range.I also found out Nikon has the worst reliability among DSLR cameras, according to consumer reports. Almost twice the problems compared to top rated Canon. Thats all I need, spend $1800 today for a Ford (Nikon) that may have problems a few years from now. Looks like quality has suffered in their desperate attempt to beat out Canon.RELIABILITY RATINGS FOR DSLR BRANDS: The smaller the number, the fewer the problems. This data includes 2007 cameras.

But I am a little more worried about cameras over $500.5..Canon5..Sony5..Olympus5..Kodak6..Fujifilm6..Casio6..Nikon7..Pentax(Data are based on over 221,000 responses about digital cameras to our Annual Product Reliability Survey conducted by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. Data have been adjusted to eliminate differences solely linked to age and usage.)Needless to say I ended up purchasing the Canon 40D. It was not even a contest. I love its look and feel. It has a steel interior and a magnesium alloy exterior. When I compare it to the Nikon and the Sony's, it just feels better built and looks like a Pro camera. I'm loving it. Just in time for spring/summer travels.So far the only downside to the Canon 40D is I now enjoy taking photos so much that I quickly fill up my 8GB card.  But I'm trying to reduce the number of pictures I take.  I dont really need 130+ photos of a tulip farm in L+RAW.  I think about 30-40 should be enough to capture the beauty.  I guess I was having a little to much fun.Dont let the positive reviews for the Nikon D300 fool you. Consider the 40D and spend the $700 in savings on better lenses. The 40D is a better camera.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,699.99", "Features": "12.3-megapixel captures enough detail for poster-size photo-quality prints\n3.0-inch LiveView LCD display; new 51-point AF system\nIn burst mode, shoots up to 100 shots at full 12.3-megapixel resolution\nEXPEED Image Processing System and similar Scene Recognition System to that found in the D3\nSelf-cleaning sensor unit; magnesium alloy construction with rubber gaskets and seals\nSelf-cleaning sensor unit magnesium alloy construction with rubber gaskets and seals\nEXPEED Image Processing System and similar Scene Recognition System to that found in the D3\n3.0-inch LiveView LCD display , new 51-point AF system\n12.3-megapixel captures enough detail for poster-size photo-quality prints\nIn burst mode, shoots up to 100 shots at full 12.3-megapixel resolution", "Name": "Nikon D300 DX 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vVs93wcSL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000VJX7DW"}}
