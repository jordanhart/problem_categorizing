{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An excellent camera and an exceptional value", "Author": "S H Thomas", "ReviewID": "R3KBXO0VSB7MNK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the Fuji Finepix 3800 for 10 days and I am extremely pleased with all aspects of this camera. Back in July, I had read an excellent magazine review of the Finepix 2800, and, after further research (including user reviews on Amazon.com), I had almost decided to purchase it. However, I was a little reluctant to buy a 2-megapixel camera, as consumer cameras were already getting to 4 megapixels. I decided to wait, hoping Fuji would update this model. A few days later they announced the 3800, and six weeks later I ordered mine....In addition to increasing the resolution to 3 megapixels, Fuji has added several features that give you more picture-taking control, such as an aperture priority mode, sharpness adjustment, flash intensity, exposure adjustment, and several white balance options. Also new is the media card type. It's called xD Picture Card, and it's quite small, about the size of a postage stamp. The camera includes one 16 MB xD card, which holds about 26 pictures at the setting I use most (3 MP / normal). The other settings are 3 MP / fine (12 pictures), 2 MP (39), and 1 MP (49). You really need a larger capacity card if you're going to be away from your computer for any length of time, such as a vacation. (I plan to get a 128 MB xD card... as soon as they are available.)The camera comes with a USB cable and various PC/Mac software applications for managing your photos. I haven't used their software; I have an iMac with iPhoto (free) for photo management (and a whole lot more) and PixelNhance (free) for photo editing. After taking a few pictures, I connected the cable to the camera and the iMac, and turned on the camera. iPhoto started up; I clicked one button and my pictures were downloaded. It was literally seconds from connecting cables to viewing my pictures. No configuration of software nor drivers nor anything else was required (thanks, Apple). The first thing I noticed was the picture quality. It is superb. The colors, the detail, everything, is quite amazing.Taking pictures is easy, once you get used to the quirks of digital photography. Press the shutter release halfway and the camera focuses (after a brief image freeze). Keeping the button down, you can reframe the picture if necessary. Press down all the way to take the picture. There is a momentary delay while the picture is stored into memory, and then your picture is shown for about 2 seconds. This lets you know if you got the picture you wanted without having to change the camera mode to view your pictures. The 6x optical zoom (equivalent to a 200 mm lens on a 35 mm camera) was a big selling point for me. I like being able to quickly frame a picture, especially from a fair distance. The electronic viewfinder (EVF) takes a little getting used to (compared to an SLR).  I only use it when I have to, such as in bright sunlight. Otherwise I use the small LCD screen on the back of the camera. If you've read reviews of the 2800, you know that low light situations can be a problem for this camera. Not having used the 2800, I can't say whether Fuji has made improvements in this area for the 3800. However, it is still true that if there's not enough light, you won't see anything in the EVF or LCD. You can still take pictures in low light; you just have to set it for the widest angle, aim as best you can, and then check the result. If you missed the subject, re-aim and try again. You can always crop the picture when you get it on your computer. This camera, by the way, takes excellent pictures with the built-in flash, even when there's little or no other light.The 3800 has a movie mode which allows you take a minute of 320x240 pixel video (or 3 minutes of 160x120) at 10 frames per second. This works great for those moments when you want a quick video but don't have the video camera. You can view the video on the camera, just like you view photos. And it's easy to download and view on your computer.Photos stored on the camera can be easily viewed and deleted if you don't want them. (You can also mark photos as \"protected\" to prevent accidental deletion.) The buttons on the camera back are laid out well and easy to use. The menus for changing the camera settings and viewing/deleting photos are intuitive and easy to learn.Like most digital cameras, this one goes through batteries very quickly. The four AA batteries included won't last very long. Better to invest in a good charger for AA NiMH batteries (the Mahi MH-C240F works great).Also included is an adapter for optional zoom or wide angle lenses. The manual actually recommends leaving the adapter on the camera at all times (presumably to protect the telescoping lens housing) though you never see any photos of this camera with the adapter on it. I don't use the adapter because the lens cap doesn't fit on it very well (pops off too easily). The lens cap works fine on the camera without the adapter.The bottom line: Fuji took an excellent, widely praised, highly regarded camera and made it better. I took a chance and bought this camera before all the reviews were in, just based on reviews of the 2800 and the additional features announced by Fuji. I have not been disappointed in the least.", "Date": "September 26, 2002"}, {"Title": "Today it's a Great Value", "Author": "Warren Holzem", "ReviewID": "R27J1M99BWATQZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Prices always change, but it's obvious that in the spring of 2003, Fujifilm positioned this camera to move off the shelves, and make a good impression.Some of the bad reviews touch on problems with this camera, but you're not going to find a perfect, or even a professional grade camera with these features in it's price range. None of the problems are fatal flaws, in my opinion.The worst flaw is that neither the LCD screen or the EVF are bright enough when the light is very low. There are other digital cameras that do this better, but if you're going to be doing a lot of low-light shooting, and you want your framing and focus to be right every time, don't get a digital camera. Get a 35mm film camera. If you're just taking snapshots at an indoor event, this can be annoying, but you can always reframe things when you edit the digital pictures. Let's face it. You're not going to have a perfect picture every time no matter what camera you use, so you're going to be doing some editting anyway. There were a couple of other issues brought up in some of the reviews I read. For example, in anything but bright sunlight, when you have the zoom fully extended to 6x, you're not going to be able to hold the camera steady enough. That would be true with any camera, digital or film. The longer the zoom, the more your minute shaking will affect the final result.Also, each time you erase the memory card, the numbering on the filenames starts over again at 1. If there is an option to change this (as I had in the Fujifilm 1300 I replaced), I have not found it yet. That means when you store your originals you'll either have to change the filenames, or store them in seperate folders.As for battery life, the first 200 pictures I took were inside shots, many using flash. Because I wear glasses, I find it easier to use the big LCD. I was able to take almost 200 pictures before the original batteries started to die. Still, I pop 4 AA alkaline batteries into my pocket when I take the camera with me.The 16MB card is too small. It's inclusion is similar to the half-full ink cartridge included with new printers, or the 10 test strips included with a blood glucosse meter. Your first purchase after deciding to keep the camera should be a 128MB card. A 128MB card will hold 90-100 pictures at the finest resolution.The camera fits perfectly in my average sized hand, but it may not fit in your hand. Of course if you have very big or very small or oddly shaped hands, you already know to check it out by holding it in your hand at a local store. The weight is quite low, and it's balanced fairly well. For most people there won't be any ergonomic issues.Three people I work with also purchased digital cameras in the same price range as the Fujifilm 3800 about the same time I did. As we compared notes, and passed our cameras around, the other three wished they would have considered the Fujifilm 3800. And while a couple of those other cameras had some neat features mine didn't, I was still satisfied with my choice.Is it a professional camera? No. Is it a perfect camera? No. Is it a great value? At the time of my purchase, and even now at the time of this review, yes it is. I have no regrets about choosing the Fujifilm 3800.", "Date": "May 17, 2003"}, {"Title": "Good picture quality, but needs too much light", "Author": "M. P. Daniels", "ReviewID": "R1E8W5V42BUW6W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for about six weeks and have taken several hundred pictures in many different situations and environments.  The Fuji Finepix 3800 has excellent picture quality with great color, detail, balance, and sharpness with a minimum of digital artifacing (I haven't observed any).  The picture quality with this camera surpasses what you might expect from a digital camera.  However, it has one very significant and major flaw that cannot be overcome. In considering whether to purchase this camera, you must decide if you can live with it.  The flaw is that it must have a great deal of light to take the high quality pictures of which it's capable.  It is permanently set for an equivalent of ISO 100 film.  This means that you cannot take indoor pictures without a flash, and many outdoor settings in the PNW are too dark for it as well.  Without using a flash indoors, your pictures will be blurred.  I have been quite frustrated by this because there are many situations where it would be preferable in a brightly lit room to NOT use a flash, yet you must do so.  With the Canon Rebel I sold to pay for this camera, I used ISO 100 film only once, finding that the graininess of higher speed film was worth the trade-off of needing summer brightness outdoor sunlight.  It is astounding that a digital camera would have such a requirement when the technology for lower light capture is available and of good quality.This camera has the ability to change settings as you might on an SLR, but you will unlikely find yourself able to use any aperature setting above 2.8 in normal situations due to the light requirements.  I decided to keep my camera because in spite of the frustrations, I found myself using it regularly, and it does take excellent pictures.  I do not think there is an alternative to this camera in this price range with these features.  The Canon that is similar to this camera has digital artifacing problems (purple fringes at contrast areas) that are more unacceptable to me than the high light requirements of the 3800.", "Date": "December 11, 2002"}, {"Title": "Read All Reviews, Unit Exceeded My Expectations", "Author": "J. Steck", "ReviewID": "R2IB0RH0IUH3MX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Did my homework. Weighed the arguments for and against. Was very careful about selecting this camera but have yet to be disappointed. Very impressed. Very satisfied.1) 6x optical zoom... only thing really keeping me latched to my SLR. Anything less is wasting my time. Digital zoom is a marketing gimmick.2) 55mm lens attachments! wide angle, circular polarized, red & blue filters. (be careful, this is still a dumb auto-focus with no manual override. Have not tried, but I would expect issues with diffusion filters) Not sure if the Fuji wide angle lens is most cost effective option. With the 55mm adapter, I would think you could shop around for a better deal. I bought the Fuji because I thought the 55mm adapter came with the lens, but it comes with the camera.3) Auto focus... no issue with the shot delay noted in other reviews. You can half push the shutter to go into dynamic auto-focus mode and never miss the 'perfect' shot with system delay. Critical with my active 4mo and 3yr subjects! The people that complained about the 1/2 second shot delay and missed shots are using this thing like a disposable 35mm. They need to read the manual.4) Power... have taken 2-300 pictures so far using LCD & flash and still on the AA alkaline that came with the unit (I don't use the USB connection, I transfer using an XD/PCMIA adapter so that is probably where I am saving power). On the reviews I expected a battery killer. Using the high capacity NmHi, power consumption may be a rare concern. My only complaint, and it may only be that I haven't found it yet, is a battery meter like I have on my cam-corder.5) LCD, I agree the display is unusually dark prior to taking the picture, but entirely usable to set up just about every shot. The low light conditions where the display is too dark to see the subject adequately is your first indication the auto focus will have a problem. Have not yet tried setting the focus on infinity and taking the shot with flash anyway. I would expect that to be a simple work around in a pinch.6) XD Picture card... the storage specs are misleading. The unit comes with a 16MB card and the specs say it will hold one 3.2mp shot. I now think that is a typo. I bought two 128MB cards in anticipation of needing more storage. To my surprise, 128MB will hold a couple hundred 3.2mp shots. I probably could have saved myself $70 and only got one card.7) Accessories... get the accessory kit for the 3800. You will spend more buying the included items individually. Fuji and Olympus seem to be sharing a lot of technology these days. Same company? or strategic alliance? My advise is to price both Fuji and Olympus stuff to find the lowest price. The Olympus PCMIA XD card reader was less than Fuji's. The Fuji XD cards are less than Olympus'.8) Image quality... camera to inkjet, printed 8x10 with no color adjustments gave incredible pictures. Add photo paper and you may not be able to tell it isn't processed film. White balance, skin tones, CYMK color saturation, pixel clarity all on the money. This 3.2mp fits my needs. Glad I didn't get drawn into spending $2-300 more for 4-5mp.9) Macro shots... tried locking on to a jumping spider on the patio screen door, but couldn't get the shot before my subject took off. Not sure if I had the setting right or not. Will be pulling out the manual so I don't miss another opportunity through ignorance.10) Low light... touch and go. Took many pictures at a party in a dimly lit basement. Some came out fine, others not completely in focus. I would expect similar difficulty with 1000 speed film in an SLR.Most bang for the buck IMO.", "Date": "May 12, 2003"}, {"Title": "This is a great camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2F9BNHQQDJ3ER", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for two months and I love it. It takes beautiful pictures. I've had no problems with it all. For those who are getting \"fuzzy\" indoor pictures, I can offer three explanations (all of which have happened to me): 1) If you forget to pop open the flash before taking the picture, you'll get a picture with good exposure that may even look okay on the LCD screen. But when you load it onto your computer, it's obviously out of focus. This is the result of not being able to hold the camera steady for the relatively long exposure time required when not using a flash. This problem is not unique to this camera nor to digital cameras in general. In fact, if you use a tripod, this camera will take gorgeous indoor pictures without a flash. 2) As instructed in the manual, you should push the shutter release down halfway (and hold it there) to allow the camera the focus. Frame your picture, and then push down all the way. If you don't do this, it's possible to get pictures out of focus. 3) In very low light conditions, the camera's auto-focus mechanism may not have enough light to focus. There is an indicator in the viewfinder to let you know when this happens.  However, this is generally not a problem with normal room lighting. (Note that all auto-focus cameras have this limitation in varying degrees.)", "Date": "December 8, 2002"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "\"mattandkhristie\"", "ReviewID": "R1BXTJ0KMQVUVM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got this camera as a birthday gift and I am thorougly enjoying it.

I have had no battery issues yet, although I plan to get some rechargeables.  This camera has some power saving features, so I don't think it is as much of a \"pig\" on the batteries.  I will probably invest in the xD card reader as well.  In low light the viewer is not the greatest, but the camera still delivers a beautiful night shot and you can make out what you are photographing, no problem.  I was between the 2800 and the 3800.

This camera, nearly a year later, is the same price I paid last year for a 2.1 MP camera (ah, technology) and takes fabulous photos.  I had read about its difficulties in indoor or low light situations, so this weekend I took it on a pretty good test of lighting conditions: a trip to the Gila Cliff Dwellings in New Mexico, where I shot in bright outdoor, dark indoor (cave interiors), from within caves facing outward, and all variety of different situations.  I found that it performed magnificently in all but the very lowest of lighting, and in these instances would have been fine if I had used a tripod.  I used both auto and manual settings and played around a lot to see how it would perform (and in doing so, whether I would keep the camera) and I was quite impressed.  My only dissatisfaction about this camera is that the lens cap is extremely inadequate and I would not consider transporting the camera anywhere without my bag because it simply will not stay in place.  Otherwise, it is compact and sturdy, uses standard AAs (nice if my rechargables die on a trip where I didn't pack the charger), and the 128 MG card I bought will take over 200 images on the highest resolution settings.

I have called several local camera shops to get info on repair and as soon as I tell them what model camera it is they say \"Oh, no we don't do that here.\" So I have now decided to purchase a new camera, it unfortunately is another Fuji(the s5000), but it has everything and more that I want in a camera and hopefully I'll have better luck.

I liked the fact that it is slightly bulkier than other digital cameras.  The salesman told me that although it has 3.2 mp, you are able to print at 6 megapixels.  After printing some pictures, I found out that if you enlarge the pictures to \"poster\" size the quality doesn't degrade.  Luckily I have a photo printer.  Like you, I read through all the reviews before finally deciding on a product.  I don't know why there are people out there that give this camera a negative review.  Of course there are pros and cons to any electronics product you buy so to help you out I have included some that I have experienced myself.Pros:- Extremely user-friendly!- Both the LCD display and the viewfinder are in color.- The zoom feature is decent.- It has a pop-up flash and the brightness can be adjusted.- As far as digital cameras go, this one does not consume  batteries as bad as other ones.- You can add date-stamp to your printed pictures- Set at 0.3 Megapixels you can take up to 100 pictures with just your 16 MB memory card. (Can only handle 18 pics at its megapixel maximum-- But really.. who wants to print poster-size pictures of their vacations unless you happen to be a paparazzi?Cons:- The video is grainy, and needs to be utilized in well lit areas in order to be viewed better.- The software it comes with is not all gravy but it is somewhat helpful.

Lipson", "ReviewID": "RFNCB7DWYRU7Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched digital cameras for a few months before choosing this model. The things that were most important to me were picture quality, grip/handling comfort, and audio/video capabilities. I felt good that Consumer Reports rated the picture quality as very good for this camera. This is our first digital camera. For me, this model was head and shoulders more comfortable to hold onto than any other camera I tried out. I found so many of the smaller cameras very uncomfortable to hold-too thin, slippery, or poorly balanced. I also liked the larger LCD screen, the matte black border around the screen (no glare), and the protective cover over the LCD screen surface. One reviewer of this camera highlighted the importance of the 6x optical zoom. I can say with experience that this is definitely something to NOT OVERLOOK when comparing other models. The zoom is indeed awesome and it will enable you to take pictures that you would otherwise miss or end up with a lousy miniture distance shot. I am so not techno savvy, but I've had no problems learning how to use this cameras many features with just skimming through the manual. The XD card is the bomb. So quick and efficient, very easy to use, and the read/write capability is amazing! The video with audio works well and will be awesome to have when I don't have our digital camcorder with us. I don't want to miss any cute kid moments. I find that in bright outdoor shooting the LCD screen looks dim, but don't fret. I was concerned about the LCD screen brightness because of other reviews, but I needn't be. The screen is plenty visible in any light to frame your shot. You will be shocked and amazed at the brightness and clarity of your actual shots regardless of the view via the LCD screen. You can still make out your subjects fine and the photos taken will have you shaking your head in utter disbelief. I even took pictures looking into our bathroom at night with just the night light (the room was very, very dark-no flash used). The pictures I took were completly focused and the coloring was very accurate. I truly had no difficulty viewing/focusing via the LCD screen in this very low light circumstance. The photos I've taken (about 250 or so) have blown me away. My pictures look three dimensional!! I am absolutely floored at the quality and the richness in every regard. I've made one 8x10 from a 3 \"Normal\" MG shot and the photograph was gorgeous. It looked better than shots I've taken with 35mm cameras. I take at least 24-48 photos a month on average-most of my kids. I've taken photos of my kids swinging on the playground from quite a distance using the full 6x zoom and they have come out razor sharp! I decided to give digital a try because of all the \"no good\" shots I was consistently paying for. It is awesome to have instant gratification of picture review and the ability to only print shots which are \"keepers\". I am certain this will be a cost saver in developing fees. One last note, I also had concern about the lens cap. Some people said it doesn't stay on. I have found this to be not the case whatsoever. The lens cap locks on just like my SLR. You have to depress two areas on the cap simultaneously to remove it. Once again, no problems and only the best possible experiences to report.

I've owned three digital cameras total (HP PhotoSmart 215, the Fuji FinePix 3800, and a Kodak DX6490) and this one, as far as image quality goes, is by FAR the very best (even though the Kodak is 4mp and costs $200 more *rolls eyes*) I fell in love with this camera time and time again because it never did me wrong. My photos always came out great, with such clarity and detail ([...])It pretty much worked like a charm.

It's a digital camera, a digital VIDEO camera (for short periods of time, which is unfortunate..

For our first wedding anniversary, we went back to our honeymoon location.  I captured some excellent pictures there.

By the time we got to the airport, the ring around the lens had come just about completely off.  We went to a restaurant for dinner, and the camera would not even turn on.  It was as if the warrenty had just expired, so it fell apart. I thought perhaps the batteries had died.  I tried 3 different sets of new batteries.  That wasn't it.  Today I took the camera to a place I found on Fuji's website to get it fixed.  The technician knew what the problem was right away.  the screws holding that ring on got loose and fell inside the camera, frying the circuit board.  It will cost me $199 to get it fixed.

Also you should learn how to use flash settings in the dark with this camera, or your photos may turn out dim.The camera used XD memory cards which are a little more expensive than the conventional ones (like CompactFlash, etc.) It uses four AA battery, which I think is a good feature of this camera. You can use it anywhere. If your batteries run out, at worst you have to go to a shop and get four new ones.

The batteries rest on metal tabs that do two things: They are electrical contacts, and they are supposed to act like little springs, holding the batteries up firmly against the electrical contacts in the battery compartment door.  Unfortunately, these little tabs are now sagging.  So the batteries no longer make firm contact, and, even with fresh batteries, the camera can't muster the power to take pictures.Pulling the tabs back up is problematical.  They are buried at the bottom of the battery compartment and very hard to get at.The camera still works fine if run off its power adapter.  You have to be near a power outlet.  This basically turns it into an indoors-only camera.Didn't the Fuji engineers know that a thin strip of metal, placed under constant pressure, will eventually sag?

Maybe this is an example of \"planned obsolescence\".May 12, 2011 update:  I flexed the metal tabs upward with a nut pick, and the camera is working normally again.TIP: When storing the camera, remove the batteries.

With the rubberized patches it helps you to have a good grip on your camera in on-the-go situations.A pilot-friend of mine has also purchased a Fuji 3800 and seems to be happy with its capabilities.(i've since upgraded to a Nikon and continue to get published occasionally AND fairly steady work as an event photographer).", "Date": "November 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "GREAT CAMERA, No malfunctions...", "Author": "JAC", "ReviewID": "R33XW5A04F0N3C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the Fuji Finepix 3800 in 2002 and I really Loved this camera until I Stupidly LOST it.

You have to buy quality batteries(name Brand). The ONLY thing that I wish was better was that when capturing video its only about 60seconds and if the lighting wasn't good either was the video! I was EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THIS CAMERA. Being that I must buy another one I was thinking of getting another Figi Finepix but maybe a newer model. The problem with this so far is that I want something with all the features of the 3800 and more but the next best thing is the the Fuji Finepix S3100 and theres even a way to make it like a web cam BUT the one feature that is missing on this that the 3800 has is the SOUND on the video there is NONE. That S--ks. I have children so the sound is important there is no in between its either the 3800 again or the S3100 with no sound. I wish Fuji had one right in the middle but they don't.

I purchased mine as an open box buy and got a free 64MB card free with the camera. I had been in the market for a new camera(old one is a Kodak APS), and was looking to get into digital photography this year. I read reviews and went to local stores (Best Buy, Circuit City, Wolf, and so on) and finally settled on this one. I love the fact that it has 6X optical zoom, this does really set it apart. I took it to a baseball game recently and yes it does seem a little off in taking pictures speedwise but if you get the timing down(being a second off) you can take great moving photos. I was sitting about 100' to 120' away and was still able to see the ball being hit off the bat. The camera is also great at taking pictures of wild life. The camera is great at tying in the foreground and background in alot of still life pictures I have taken so far. The pictures almost look 3-D when this happens in automatic mode. I was taking pictures right out of the box. In about 10 minutes I was taking photos. The Through The Lens viewfinder is alittle weird at first but in taking action shots and low light shots keep both eyes open. The camera is small enough on the left side that even with your hand there you can see the action. It does seem difficult at first but you get used to it really fast. My action shots have become a lot better since I started doing this. Also the price of XD cards is starting to come down in price. 256MB is the new card out with 512MB and 1Gig cards coming later this year.Yes there are some cons to this camera. The lens cover is one. I don't like using the neck strap so my lens cover does dangle, but if you wrap the lanyard for it in your fingers this does get it out of the way. It is a little bulky I would suggest getting one of Fuji's accesories kits(2 to choose from) I bought the one with the bag and rechargable batteries (much needed). Fuji also has one with a mini tripod and editing software. Get the one with the tripod and software it's a much better value.The one thing I would like to see is that Fuji would come out with is a Fisheye Lens. There is a wide angle and telephoto lens available though for this camera. The FinePix software is a great basic software with one click adding of photos. But don't forget to save then edit names of pictures AND DON'T FORGET THE .JPG after the picture.

About 2/3 of my shots are taken indoors and this camera is useless inside unless the room is lit like a Hollywood set. The camera will not focus at any distance in normal indoor lighting. On the auto setting, inside shots always come out grainy. The flash is simply to weak to help. Since there is no way to manually focus the pictures you are constantly crossing your fingers hoping that the shot will come out somewhat decent so you can later fix the image on the computer.The software that came with the camera does not have a red eye option to fix the red eye this camera is famous for giving your subjects. When you try to use the red eye reduction flash it always and I repeat always gives your subject red eye and always makes it worse had you left it off.There is what looks like a screw on lens on the camera (not shown in product image) so you think you will have the ability to add a different lens. It is actually there to hold a filter. Since this camera is not a popular model FujiFilm has not made any filters (maybe 2) for you to use so its really just misleading.The video sizes are 160 x 120 and 320 x 240. Which are ok for thumb nails but not something you are really able to watch. Since the camera is grainy at low light (meaning anything shot indoors) and the flash is only for pictures, your videos will be small, grainy, out of focus, and do nothing but fill up your memory card. The audio for the video is also useless unless you have bionic ears and can make out the mummbles.The shutter lag is awful. No matter what trick you try you will always miss an action shot. There is a Sport mode on the camera but I'm not sure what it does since it does not help with focus, shutter lag, lighting, etc.On the good side, it's a cheap camera but you get what you pay for with it.I'll keep using it until I can afford a better DSLR camera but you can bet once my new camera shows up this one will be given to my teenage son to abuse.", "Date": "February 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Poor Reliability", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Mike\"", "ReviewID": "R31BBW6IW3WHP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had this camera for less than 2 years and used it only on rare occasions - you know, holidays and special events - so it has pretty low usage.

I am the primary user of the camera.  (This model provided the balance between features and price at the time it was purchased.)  This is a good little camera, adequate for general use, with one or two sticking points to be aware of.This camera has difficulties in low-light -- even ordinary room lighting -- without a flash.  (In fairness, this disfeature is a fairly common occurrence in many cameras of this caliber and price range, though, as is the JPEG artifacts one gets in the images.)  Using the flash will help with out-of-focus photos but go through batteries faster, the resulting photographs are usually less pleasing too -- people harshly lit with drastic shadows.  (This can sometimes be minimized with thought and care.)If you are not afraid to use the manual settings, brace the camera against something, or use a tripod, it is often the way to go.  Some great shots can be had, even in room light, with manual settings, a tripod or steady hand, and a steady subject.  In fact, using manual will often produce a better photo, with more natural color, than can be achieved with the automatic settings usually!  Well worth learning.The use of standard AA size batteries is a plus.  I thought that the use of four AA batteries (rather than two) might mean longer life.  I was incorrect.  Be prepared with extra batteries and/or a good quick charger, especially when flash or zoom is used.The biggest annoyance with this camera for me personally, though, is the fact that every time the batteries die, or are changed, the date must be reset before the camera will allow any photographs to be taken.  (I don't even bother setting the date any longer.  I just hit two or three buttons to skip past it all, but it's required every time the batteries die or are changed.)  I've often wished the camera contained a capacitor or watch battery to maintain its memory while batteries were changed.  (I believe newer Fugi models may have resolved this issue though; Fugi has some newer models with nice improvements and optical zooms up to 10x, in similarly price models.)In the end, I would not discourage anyone from buying this model.  The photo quality is on par with any of the rival models, just be aware of this model's quirks.  Generally speaking, Fugi seems to make a fine camera.  I just wish we had held off for another year and the newer models.", "Date": "June 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "David E., Kelley \"dek\"", "ReviewID": "R1VHMSS1WZ5XWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love my camera, it takes the greates pictures even it your not a professional.

The eyepiece seems to be a small lcd display; in low light, you can't see anything. Last but not least, I wish that it was more point and shoot.

Wong", "ReviewID": "R14HK0I0JC8651", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I brought my brand new Finepix 3800 to Las Vegas and took about 200 pictures with it, both indoor and out, in the daytime and at night, mostly without using the flash.  The pictures came out sharp and the colors were brilliant.  My pictures of the Strip at night of the casinos are postcard quality.  For outdoor night shots, I put the camera on something solid before shooting the picture to prevent shaking, since I did not bring a tripod with me.  Most of the pictures were taken at 1/2 second with f/2.8 (Note: Fuji includes this info in the file, I only find out after loading the pictures on my computer).  When situations permit, I have also put the camera down and used the self-timer to take pictures, further eliminating camera shake.This is my very first digital camera.  My other camera is a Nikon N70 SLR, shooting pictures since the '60s with a Minolta SRT-101.  The color of a picture of an orchid taken at the Mirage was so rich, it put all of my Nikkor lenses to shame.  I also took some pictures inside St Mark's Square (indoor) at the Venetian.  The 3800 was able to produce accurately the color of the performers' costumes.  The night shots taken on top of the Eiffel Tower at Paris were fantastic.  What I am trying to illustrate is that I have no problems taking pictures in low light and how accurate the 3800 is in terms of color.Other than the small 16MB xD card, the only other problem I've found with the 3800 is that once you press the shutter to focus, the picture on the camera's LCD screen \"freezes\" and you won't see the subject moving (this was a problem shooting lion pictures at the MGM).  So you really can't focus first and take a shot even a second later.  I've bought a 512MB xD card, with it I can take up to 400 pictures using 3.2 megapixels in \"fine\" mode.  I find 3.2 megapixels just the right size, fine enough for my pictures and not too big in terms of file size.  Another must is a set (or 2) of rechargeable NiMH AA batteries.  I use a Rayovak 1 hour charger.  I do wish the flash has a higher guide number, allowing it to reach a subject farther away, but then I shouldn't compare it with my Nikon SB-28 dedicated flash.  :-)Others have complained about Fuji always uses the same filenames beginning with 0001.  Some have also complained about the lens cap falling off.  I don't find either to be a problem.  I do keep the adapter ring on at all times.  It protects the camera lens from accidental scratches and the lens cap fits the adapter ring nicely.The 3800 comes with a CD-ROM.  The only software you must load is the USB Mass Storage Driver.  Once you've loaded that and connected the camera to the computer with the USB cable provided, the camera becomes a \"removable drive\" on your computer and you can use Windows or MS-DOS to copy the picture files to your computer hard drive.  It works extremely well.  The camera is also suppose to work with the Mac.The 6X optical zoom lens is mighty long.The camera is easy to use, though you do have to read the manual at least once to learn how to use all the features.  It was rated no. 1 by Consumer Report two years (2002 & 2003) in a row for 3 megapixel digial cameras.  Even though the 3800 is an older model, it is still an excellent camera.  I paid $296 for it, before a $60 manufacturer mail in rebate.

The XD card it comes with is small, but I found that I downloaded the pictures so frequently that it didn't matter (I didn't ever run out of space). I've gotten a larger XD card since then (64) and have yet to run out of space with it.  The batteries have lasted quite a while (I still haven't gotten a set of rechargeables) and I don't feel that I've gone through a \"ton\" of batteries.

It takes really nice quality pictures and you can choose from several different resolution levels.  I got it because it does video.  As I understand, the video quality from digital cameras is usually not the greatest, and on the **lower** resolution, the Fuji 3800 is no exception to that rule.  On the lower resolution when you are inside, the video tends to be grainy and very dark (This is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5).  You have to turn on a LOT of lights to get a viewable inside video.  However, on the higher resolution and outside (or in a very well lit room) the video quality is actually pretty DECENT!  However on the lower resolution, you can take 200 sec videos, whereas on the higher resolution you can only take around a minute (I forget exactly how long.) Still it is a lot of fun.  Personally, I also like the fact that it takes alkaline batteries.  None of the other cameras (with the same features) I looked at did that.  They all required special (expensive) rechargeable batteries.  I am not always going to be in a place where I can recharge my batteries and I don't want to buy a replacement rechargeable battery.  However, you can always run to the nearest convenience store and get AA batteries.  As far as memory goes, I bought a 128 mg card for about $60 and it is serving me quite well.  It stores quite a few pictures (of course the number depends on the picture quality, but at a lower-but still very acceptable quality--it can store up to several hundred pictures.)

I was so excited when it arrived and I took it on vacation with me to Florida. It was the first time my children were going to Disney, so I was eager to have the digital quality pictures as keepsakes. Well, little did I know that every single picture this camera takes looks blue! No matter what the lighting was, or what my focus was, every picture came out with a blue tint over EVERYTHING...as if taken through a thin plastic blue screen. At first I thought it was just the LCD display, but after printing the pictures upon my return home...all BLUE. I was so upset that my memories had been ruined by a junk camera. I got in contact with Fujifilm about this product and they took no responsibility. They told me to try taking a class on photography instead of blaming them! How insulting can you get. They were quite angry and rude in saying it was my bad camera skills and had nothing to do with their camera. Unless you want pictures where everything looks blue, stay far away from this terrible product!", "Date": "April 19, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great pix, really flimsy body", "Author": "\"mrogan\"", "ReviewID": "R1WU866GCCRNNA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "OK. You want great pictures from a camera, right? You'll get them with this one. But there's something else a really good ... camera should deliver. A good, solid feel in your hand. It's almost TOO light. The entire camera is PLASTIC and has the feeling of a disposable. This would be a 5 star PLUS camera if the body were titanium and it had a bit more heft. I wouldn't reccomend this camera to a friend. I KNOW there are more solid cameras out there.

It has to do with the fact that it only supports xD mem. As if there were not already enough memory formats, yet another one. It seems to be about either desperate, or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever. Why can't we just have one or two formats of memory?? This is as bad as it would be to have 5+ formats of CD-RoM drives. And SONY is even more guilty than fuji/olympus.  Smartmedia was developed by Toshiba/Fuji/Olympus, and now Fuji/Olympus couldn't get along with Toshiba/Panasonic for the sD card. Memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices. We need to standardize the market. We can't afford to buy special memory for each and every device. If you buy Fuji/0lympus, I sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xD. Together the people can control the market for our own good..", "Date": "December 27, 2002"}, {"Title": "Horrible choice", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3CPSWYLEHV9HH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just got this camera and It isnt what I expected it to be. The weird shape makes it hard to grip and if you aren't using the flash youre pictures get fuzzy. The worst part about this camera is the software. It takes up a chunk of your hard drive but bassically only crops your photos. I suggest getting Adobe Photoshop for digital cameras, you can download it off of Kazaa. The memory card is cool but it only comes with a 16 MB card which only stores about 8 photos. This camera EATS batteries for breakfast, I had to get rechargables. After all of the accessories you need to buy are added on to the total price it comes out to around $ dolars.
