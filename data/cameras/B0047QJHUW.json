I purchased a camera pen from them.  The product did not work from the get go.  I paid $180 for the pen.  I tried charging it with the usb/wall adapter, no luck.  I plugged it into the computer and folders of nothing would pop up.  No lights would turn on on the pen when charging it, resetting it, attempting to film, etc.I called the tech support number provided 1-800-590-4272 option 2.  The lady on the phone was rude, ignorant and defensive.They can have their crappy product back.  I am cancelling the transaction with PayPal.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "MD90 Mini DVR camera", "Author": "GMan", "ReviewID": "R2D4U346G2SEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received my replacment MD90 DVR mini camera. The original unit could not be read by my computer, so I had to return it. Nonetheless, the vendor was great in following up with me to have the issue resolved, as well as send a new replacement camera. I charged the new camera and did a couple of short recordings (aprrox. 30 seconds). The camera worked great and the images were great as well! Would recommend for anyone that is interested in a mini camera.  Great customer service and quick resolution!!", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good idea, but still looking for a better camera", "Author": "travelingmike", "ReviewID": "R3VDEKFZAO7637", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "To be fair, only used camera a little, but found some flaws.Liked:-Small size-Micro SD slot upgradeable-Voice feature option (bud did not use it)Disliked:-Poor sound quality-Camera too heavy to hang on breast pocket; clipped here in pocket with the weight makes it point to your feet.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$128.49", "Features": "Higher Recording Resolution (640x480)\nHigher Frames per Second (30fps)\nDirect from manufacturer - no cheap copies!\nProGrade Alloy Housing\nTime and Date Stamp", "Name": "KJB Security Products DVR90 Prograde Minicam Camcorder", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tPgp3wDSL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0047QJHUW"}}
