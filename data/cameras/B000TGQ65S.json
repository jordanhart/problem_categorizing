{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice", "Author": "Mark Thieme", "ReviewID": "R1PQGZX0A0N6D5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as an effort to modernize my 2 megapixel Olympus.  The menu system is a huge leap in ease of usability and is one of this cameras greatest assets.  I didn't even need to crack open the manual to start.  Ergonomics are good, maybe a hair on the small side for me.  Everything is easy and intuitive to reach.  I expected a significant difference in picture quality, but the largest thing I normally print out is 5\"x7\" so I have not really been able to take advantage of the MP increase.  I have not noticed a difference in detail even using the higher resolution.  Zoom is no better than then older Olympus if as good...a little disappointing, but I haven't seen a point and shoot with a zoom I like.  Flash too is minimal typical of point and shoots.  Battery life is so-s0 but I have purchased a couple extras which you should have in your camera bag anyway.  There is a little metal tab which apparently holds the battery in place that does not retract to get the battery out.  This is easily bent.  You need a toothpick and a third hand to remove the battery  and replace it without bending the latch.  Obviously a design issue.  Interestingly, the SD card adjacent to the battery has no need for such a flimsy latch.  I have had some auto focus issues, but have not tinkered with all the different settings.  It has the typical delay while the camera performs this task.  On a couple of occasions, seemingly it couldn't make up it's mind determining the proper focus.  Red eye reduction is excellent.  The software that comes with it is okay, nothing too fancy but it does the job.  It also includes a program that allows you to take pictures of business cards and it attempts to transfer these into a database.  Two major problems with this.  One, the database is proprietary.  Two, it was only able to correctly do this on less than 5% of the samples I tested.  You're better off typing.  Good idea, really poor implementation.  Overall, I am happy with the camera, but probably would have been just as happy continuing with the older Olympus as my picture taking consists of snapping candid shots of the grandkids and stills for eBay.", "Date": "January 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good, but not great", "Author": "J. N. Mosley Jr.", "ReviewID": "R5H559A5BYG84", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera because I had lost my old 10mp point and shoot from Sony.  I have recently been purchasing Samsung products so I figured I'd give their camera a chance also.  I was initially excited with the 12.1mp resolution of this camera but after I've tried taking nearly 500 pictures in different lighting, settings, and anything else I could try, I've found that the pictures just aren't that great.  The definition between colors in the photos, even those in good lighting, were blurred.  I still have an old 5mp sony and I the same pictures with both cameras and didn't see much of a difference, and in less lighting, the sony did better.  Next is the flash, why they made it a pop up flash, that you have to push back down when you're done, doesn't make sense to me.  Plus the flash isn't that bright, again my Sony old 5mp sony did better there.  The Samsung almost has to have perfect lighting to take a picture without blurring, even with pictures taken with the ISO on auto, with about a 1/500 and it still showed some shakiness, not seen with my older Sony.  The navigation system with the camera is pretty convenient though, I do like that feature.  All in all I think I will be taking the camera back and purchasing either a Sony or trying for the Cannon this time.  I admit that I've been partial to Sony for years now so my opinion my be biased, just do your research before you purchase this camera.", "Date": "April 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung Digimax camera", "Author": "Deborah A.
