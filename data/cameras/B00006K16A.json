{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A real camera!!", "Author": "RJB", "ReviewID": "R1I5TG7U5RSRXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using a variety of 35mm SLR cameras for more than three decades and I place great importance on the feel of the camera in my hand. I approached my recent purchase of a 5MP camera with some early leaning towards Nikon since I've worked with two of their CoolPix cameras. I tried to do my homework on the web and am aware of most +'s and -'s.The hands-on experience sold me on the Minolta 7Hi. I love the fact that there is manual control, on the lens, of the zoom. I love the fact that the camera permits \"DMF\" or direct manual focus, which allows you to take advantage of a fast autofocus system that feels much faster than the Nikon (35mm or CoolPix), and THEN to tweak it manually with a ring on the lens. I love the fact that the LCD switches off whenever you put the camera up to your eye to use the electronic viewfinder (EVF).About four weeks of shooting in Islamorada, Miami, and New York have only strengthened the love affair. This is one great camera. The images, both on screen and printed are gorgeous. I don't print at >=11X14 and the noise is so much better (to my eye) than my earlier digital cameras that I can not say it is a problem. The 12bit A/D and the 64MB RAM buffer in the camera are really nice additions that I think are not found in the other two 5MP choices. The UHS (ultra high speed) mode is incredible.....we're going to use that in my research laboratory in ways that I hadn't even imagined at the time I chose the camera (thanks to an adaptor from Brunel Microscopes in UK) . Finally, I think they designed the menus in a very easy to learn way. Nikon menus (880, 990, 995) always seemed a bit impenetrable to me. But, I move through all the 7Hi menus all the time and had little difficulty keeping straight how to do what where. This is a real credit to those who designed the user interface.I've added a spare set of 4 AA 1850mAh batteries and (now that each set has been cycled 3-4 times) this will be more than enough for many hundreds of 5MP shots. I also sprang for a 49mm UV filter, a couple of high speed 256MB CF cards and am considering a firewire CF card reader. Otherwise, the bundle is complete.My single most significant gripe is that the Minolta software crashes all the time under Mac OS X 10.2. The current Mac version is useless, while the Windows version seems OK. But, this isn't the camera's fault, presumably is something that Minolta will fix soon, and really only limits your use of RAW images. Photoshop, Canvas, or iPhoto all work fine. This is a real camera that just happens to store the images digitally rather than on film. I'd say this camera finally delivers on the digital promise.", "Date": "November 17, 2002"}, {"Title": "The best digicam on the market", "Author": "\"srk4golf\"", "ReviewID": "R3T1M49MGNLJLE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent several months researching the high end amateur digital cameras, looking for (and hoping to find) the ideal camera to pursuade me to give up film photography.  I had a very demanding set of criteria: great lens, at least 5 MP, at least 7X optical zoom, lots of photographic control, Compact Flash and IBM microdrive compatible, non-proprietary rechargeable batteries, and it had to feel really good in my hands.  To my surprize, such a camera does exist - the Minolta Dimage 7Hi. I tried it out at a local store, and was so impressed I immediately ordered it from Amazon.com.  Now, over 4,000 pictures later, I'm absolutely thrilled. This is one awesome camera, that takes incredible pictures. Every feature works like clockwork, and the photo control is terrific. It's solid and even looks great. I've compared my pictures to those of a few friends using Canon and Nikon high-end digicams, and the 7Hi results are as good or better.  I'm a very picky person who's been into photography and darkroom work for over 30 years, and I I've not shot a picture using film since I bought my DImage 7Hi - it's just too good and too much fun.If you want a great digicam, that produces photos that rival the best you've taken with film, this camera won't disappoint.", "Date": "May 26, 2003"}, {"Title": "Finest I've ever owned or Used", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R6METW1JKS60A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a serious amateur photographer for at least 50 years.  This is my 3rd digital camera.  It was difficult deciding between the Nikon 5700 and the Minolta 7Hi.  The 28mm capability of the zoom lens plus all the other features made me go for the Minolta.I've not been disappointed.  The lens is absolutely pin sharp.  The Auto focus (a problem with all the Nikon coolpix cameras) is right on for 99.9% of my exposures.  And it focuses quickly.If this camera has a weak point....it is the hot shoe which is a propriatory one which can be used only with Minolta external flash units.  It is a dirty trick that Minolta played and their flash units cost a fortune.  Hopefully Vivitar will come along with a compatible flash unit for the 7Hi.I've never been able to observe the so-called noise that some reviewers have objected to in the images.  Low light level images turn out beautifully.I've tried all the color profile settings while playing around with the various profiles with my HP printer.  I've finally returned to the Normal sRGB setting even though it has a smaller gamut than the Adobe RGB profile.  I seem to realize better compatibility with my printer when I use the sRGB setting.Images made with the camera then blown up to 8 X 10 on matte surface paper have an almost 3 dimensional quality.  Beautiful, rich colors, so sharp it's almost too good to be true.This is the sharpest lens and best camera I've ever owned in my life and I'm 67 years old.  AND, guess what?  The local Micro Center store had a 20% off sale on all digital cameras so I was able to get my 7Hi at a reasonable price from a local dealer without having to fight with high pressure salesmen on the phone.This one is a real keeper.", "Date": "May 29, 2003"}, {"Title": "Perfect lightweight replacement for SLR film camera", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R35T5H6QL1V7M0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Feature-packed but easy to use.  For the quickshot, just remove the lens cap, turn the control dial from \"off\" to \"record\", turn the zoom ring on the lens while composing, press the shutter release part way to focus and meter then all the way down to take the picture.  About one second later you can take another one.  Buttons and dials are very intuitive.  While composing and enjoying the full information viewfinder you can roll the function wheel, located just behind the shutter button, to change the f/stop-shutter combination.  The autofocus draws a red box around the object focused on.  If by chance the autofocus selected the wrong object, just turn the focus override ring on the lens until the correct object is in focus.  The auto and manual focus are both very fast, accurate, and work great in low light.  The viewfinder autoswitches to black and white in extreme low light to make autofocusing easier.  For great skin tones, press the mode button to select portrait.  For continuous focusing and high shutter speed press it again for action.  Again for scenery, nightshots, or document photo.  Button on side toggles between manual and auto focus.  Function dial in combination with function wheel allows you to scroll through any combination of compensations for color, contrast, brightness, ISO equivalent (100-800), burst frame speed (up to 7fps), exposure control (program, aperture, shutter, or manual), and metering mode.  This same dial is used to control what type of bracketing you want to do in burst mode.  For normal pictures, you can leave everything in automatic.  For unusual situations you can apply manual override.  Built-in flash casts a soft light on the subject rather than the harsh light by some point-and-shoots.  If you want super flash power using your old manual flash rather than buying a compatible new automatic shoe-mounted external flash, you can attach any pc-cord type external flash and set the exposure to manual.  Press the info and function buttons at same time to see a much brighter viewfinder when manually controlling exposure.  There is also a button that quickly resets your controls to programmed automatic in case you don't want to individually return the controls to automatic.  I chose over the Nikon Coolpix 5700 because in-store model 5700 did not focus very fast, 7Hi uses standard filters (49mm) without adapters, 7Hi 28mm equivalent wide angle gets more people in the picture, the 7Hi 200mm equivalent telephoto matched anything I ever needed in my SLR film camera, 7Hi has dual range macro allowing me to focus at the telephoto setting so I get the shot without casting shadows on the tiny subject, and the 7Hi uses standard AA batteries.  The battery charge life is a bit short but I do not believe I would swap any feature it has for longer battery life.  I simply carry at least two spare sets of batteries and the charger on my outings.  Under moderate use I get about two hours of use per charge.  Drops to just over an hour for heavier use.  Recharge time is 4 hours.  To me the functionality and results are well worth the slight battery inconvenience.

This is a great camera, the most annoying thing about a digital Camera is you have to wait to take the next photo, but DiMage 7HI has 64mb of internal memory that allows you to do continous shooting, another point it uses AA batteries, I bought 2 additional sets of 1850 MAH rechargable batteries, $20!!,  in addition to one set that came with it, I never run out of power compare that to the proprietry battries from SONY!. Compact Flash CF media is very affordable, I use an IBM 1GB microdrive with this camera, it makes a great combination. Just realize that IBM microdrive has much faster write speed than regualar CF cards that also help speed up your recycle time between shots. You can also use a new hard drive called  Magicstor 2.2GB for $250, I take this camera on vacation for a week, come home with 400 shots of the highest quality!. Auto focus is %99 accurate. 7x optical zoom, fantastic quality.

Forty years later, the quality and ergonomics are still there.When you're looking for a 5MP camera, there are really just two items for the non-pro to consider: this one, and the Nikon Coolpix 5700. I was a Coolpix nut before I moved up to 5MP, but this camera won out, for two reasons: the manual zoom and the processor. Even on the highest-quality setting -- one that will produce a picture of 20 by 25 inches with great resolution -- this camera will take three pictures per second. Think about your toddler son blowing out candles on his birthday cake or your grown-up daughter throwing a bouquet at her wedding and you'll want this camera.The manual zoom is much quicker, and quicker-responding, than the motorized zoom of the Nikon. When you looking for the-right-shot, this is a heckuva boon. I want a nimble camera, and this is it.As this isn't a perfect world, there is a caveat. To get full use of this powerful tool, you'll have to buy some more: Photoshop 7.01 AND the Adobe RAW plug-in. Once you've shelled out the shekels for those, though, you've got a picture-producing system that is just about idiot-proof. With the software you can screw up everything except the focus -- the exposure, the white balance, the lot. The RAW plug-in lets you use the raw (sorry) data from the camera and overcome bad color and bad exposure.I have had this camera for two months and I've taken about 600 pictures. Yes, I've saved only perhaps 150 of them, but that's why we use digital! All of those I have saved are near-enough to professional to satisfy me. Now, if only I can get a fire-wire card reader ...

I'm having more fun with the 7Hi than I've had in years.  This camera is capable of doing far, far more than I had any idea was possible. I'm still trying to figure out what all I can do with this camera. The quality of the image on \"very fine\" mode is unbelievable. Between the 7Hi and my new Photoshop Elements 2.0 I'm finding how much fun it is to have a darkroom on my desktop.  The instruction manual is not the easiest thing to use, however; and don't bother with the Dimage Viewer - go straight to Photoshop.This is no camera for for the point and shoot folks.  Aside from the price, this piece requires a bit of photo knowledge to get where you're going.  You can set it up to point and shoot, but there are many better options for that at much lower price.Overall I believe the results achieved by the 7Hi are limited only by the abilities of the photographer.", "Date": "July 14, 2003"}, {"Title": "Yet another faulty USB connection story.", "Author": "Lou I.", "ReviewID": "R2K45ECJ071I0L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've read all the reviews on this camera, and it is all that people say it is. It has a great feel, and is packed with a ton of fantastic Prosumer features.In all the reviews I have read there is one flaw that seems to appear frequently, .....faulty USB connector.I received my camera, I immediately read the manuals, installed the software, and started shooting (I love the artificial shutter sound). I went to transfer the pictures to my PC (Windoze XP on a P4)... and guess what... It couldn't find the camera.I reread the software and camera manuals 2 times. There are no soft or hard switches to enable the USB port. I set the camera to all possible modes (including transfer) no luck. I tried another USB port, another USB cable, I upgraded the DImage Software, I upgraded the camera's firmware, I tried the cable with my 3030 it worked on all USB ports, I read the flash card through a card reader ...the DImage software found the card and transferred the pictures.  The USP Port is broken, faulty, flawed, kaput.Back it goes..Repackaged..Dropped at UPS for return to the merchant... (Tough choice, back to the merchant or to Minolta for repair! I opted to return it to the merchant to avoid the inevitable frustration of proving to the manufacturer that the camera is actually broken, and I'm not retarded... i.e. \"Try this\" \"Try that\" we'll send you new software yada yada yada)Wait 15 days while the wheels of the dot com bureaucracy crank out a replacement camera.

I've read of too many USB failures from too many consumer reviews for this to be a coincidence. I think Minolta isn't adquately testing the camera's USB port during it's QA process.I love the camera... I'm happy with my selection... I just wish I didn't have to deal with this one minor issue, and all the time it takes to cure it!P.S.

It's the third Dimage I've had - previously, I owned the 7 and the 7i, and I *may* go for the A1 soon.It's a fine camera, but it's not a *great* camera.Pros:- solid construction- wonderful manual features, esp. the rotating focus ring- lots of controls to customize shots- excellent zoom lens, that happens to be manual (a plus!)- variety of colorspaces to choose from- uses standard AA batteriesCons:- some noise, mostly on 800 ISO shots- complex to learn- hard to carry around - it's not that heavy, but it's awkward- eats batteries (though this has not been a problem for me, as I just carry a spare set of rechargeables)- rubber ring around zoom lens requires occasional removal and re-taping (as on all of the Dimage 7's)This camera has so many features that it opens a lot of doors for experimentation.  The ones I particularly use:- manual zoom- manual focus- 30 sec bulb exposure- external flash port- good \"sunset\" mode- good video w/ audio- digital viewfinder that switches to B/W in low light- high speed shot mode- excellent digital zoom doubler (2x)For $600 new, the current price, it would be hard to find a camera even close to this quality for $200 more.", "Date": "December 11, 2003"}, {"Title": "Not bad, but not great", "Author": "Coleman Yee", "ReviewID": "R35VREEOC7IQQW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've you've never used a high-end camera in your life, you would think this is a pretty good camera. But I have, and I'm pretty disappointed.What disappointed me:- Wrong subject focused. If you let the camera's artificial intelligence pick the subject to focus for you, you're likely to have to refocus a lot, unless you fix the focusing point.- Impossible action focusing. If the subject is moving, you can forget about getting it in focus in the continuous focus mode. You'd have to prefocus.- Slow focusing. Even slower than some compacts.- Power hungry. Make sure you get spare batteries. I have a feeling that most of the power goes to heating the CF card, since the card gets pretty hot when reading/writing.What kept me from trashing it:- Picture quality is pretty good.- Adobe RGB colorspace can be useful (if you use it).- Good lens range (28mm-200mm equiv.), with decent quality throughout.- Pretty good macro performance.- Manual zoom, but this is subjective.- Comfortable to handle, though slightly small.- Useful view modes, like grid or crosshair.- Useful manually controlled focusing point.- Allows screw-on filters.So should you buy one? I'd say that if you do any form of action photography, be it sports or just cute kids running around, look elsewhere.

I have been shooting 35mm SLR's for 20 years and I may never go back. I picked this camera up used 2 weeks ago and have just printed my second set of prints through a good camera shop. For the second time my jaw dropped at how wonderful the colors, and black and white for that matter, looked. The one thing to watch for when printing and this is with all digital cameras is the ratio size compared to 35mm. You will need to constrain the image a bit in a computer-based software like Photoshop or Paintshop pro to avoid getting part of your image. Simply use the marquee tool and set it to a fixed aspect ratio and the crop the image. Once you have gotten beyond this there is no limit to what you can do with this camera.

(The Minolta 7i is a half-step below but less expensive; Sony's 717 is a full step behind but worth a look.)  Minolta has it all if you're used to an SLR: a zoom ring rather than the motorized step-zoom familiar to users of video cameras; a manual focus mode that uses an SLR-like focus ring; and a very useful zoom range -- effectively 28 - 200 mm vs. the Coolpix's 35 - 280 mm.  For landscapes and interior shots 28 mm is better than 35 mm and you'd need a tripod to get good shots with the Nikon's longest telephoto setting.  The Minolta fits well in one's hands -- better than the Nikon 5700.  Nikon has a flip-out LCD panel, but it's small.  Though the Monolta's big LCD panel doesn't flip out, the viewfinder rotates up.  (Be sure to adjust the diopter dial for the viewfinder to match your vision.)The controls are logically laid out and the important ones are easy to access from dials on the camera, without having to go through little menus on the LCD screen.  But you need to familiarize yourself, because there are lot of options.  Sit down with the manual and camera for a couple of hours and take some pictures with the various settings --contrast, saturation, manua focus, spot meter, etc. etc.  The Minolta manual is pretty good, although there's no index. The resolution is very good - a close-enough replacement for 35 mm film.  At the finest JPEG setting, 16 x 20 enlargements should be OK, even with a bit of cropping.  There is \"noise\" (like graininess in high-speed film) if the camera is set to act like ISO 400 or 800 film, but if it's set at ISO 100 or 200 it's not a major problem.  You can also shoot in \"RAW\", the Minolta-specific data format used by the camera before it creates the JPEG file.  If you do that, spend an extra few $ and download a Photoshop/Photoshop Elements plug-in ...it lets you tune RAW images far more effectively than the ... software Minolta supplies with the camera, and it opens them directly into the Adobe software.Minolta uses standard rechargeable AA NiMH batteries (don't use alkaline!) and the camera comes with a good charger, but it takes few cycles of charging for them to reach full staying power and even then you'll need an extra set of batteries -- get 2000 mA rechargeables (or higher), which will outlast the 1800 mA ones supplied with the camera.  Fortunately they're inexpensive compared to the proprietary batteries in Nikon and Canon cameras.  You'll also want to buy a 49 mm UV or Skylight filter to protect the lens and you absolutely have to buy a CompactFlash card.  Minolta gives you a 16 MB card that holds only a handful of high-resolution images. (Nikon's 32 MB card is only marginally better.) Buy a CF card with 256 or 512 MB -- preferaby SanDisk or Lexar because some other brands don't work with the Minolta.  A 512 MB CF card will hold about 100 images at the higest-quality JPEG setting.  You'll also want Adobe Elements or another good image editing software.  When you add up the accessories you'll spend another 25%-35% over and above the cost of the camera (not including the cost of a printer), but you'll have a very versatile, light-weight, high resolution camera to enjoy.", "Date": "April 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "Exceeding Quality & Performance", "Author": "D.

I purchased the camera on 7/22/03 and the Minolta 7Hi has got to be one of the best camera buys I've ever made. The wide range of options offered in this model is so amazing I thought I was using my Minolta XTSi, which has some of the same features on the 7Hi, the appearance, ergonomics', options, quality and functionality is what set this camera apart from all other Digital's.I love the vivid color option, which really enhances and brings out the rich colors and the picture quality is awesome due to a superbly clean focusing lens.I have experimented with all the picture quality options, but I continue to use the super fine setting, tight grains, and crisp clear pictures.The sports mode setting is awesome; the camera will process the pictures as you continue to snap shots on fast moving items and storing the pictures in the internal memory (64MB) until it's finished writing to the flash card.I bought this camera as a bundled package, case, tripod extra 256MB CF, UV & Polarizing filters, Macro & 2X telephoto lenses with a spare set of rechargeable batteries with charger. The chances are if you are a serious photographer you will want these anyway so it's defiantly a cost savings. I tried to use regular AA bat's (DON'T) this camera is designed to use rechargeable, it will drain the regular AA's in mere minutes!!I did purchase eight (2 Sets) of 2300 mAh batteries and fully charged there's more than enough juice to use up a 256MB Card, worth the investment.I had started out with a low end digital (1.3 MP Olympus), not sure if digital was for me, but after using it I basically grew out and wore out of this one (Sent it in twice for repairs) and was in the market for a more entry level professional model. Looked at the Nikon's, Canons, Fuji ... I didn't settle because I wanted the best quality for my money, so the Minolta 7Hi was the ticket. I'm now getting better picture results with this digital camera and can make the same adjustments as a 35MM SLR, aside from the non interchangeable lens this camera steps up and exceeds the 35MM Film class.The 16MB card supplied with the camera is a joke in my opinion; I don't think it would be too much to ask for Minolta to supply at a minimum 64 or 128 MB CF card.I've played a little with the movie clips but not enough to comment on other than it doesn't seem to stay in focus when I try to zoom in?? This could be user error, due to lack of experience.I have not played with the external flash option yet, but plan to in the near future. The hot shoe option on this model is replaced with a cable type plug-in?? Don't know why other than it's a proprietary thing with Minolta? A way to charge more for a product it seems.Overall if you're a Photonut, take a lot of pictures, and want a little more out of a digital camera, you'll get plenty from the 7Hi.I would give this one 6 stars but only 5 are available!!", "Date": "September 20, 2003"}, {"Title": "Damage rather than Dimage and POOR service", "Author": "donald wong", "ReviewID": "R73KUX6SKEPVL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera based on positive reviews by other.

When I sent this to Minolta, they told me they would not honor the warranty because the camera had been \"used a lot.\"  In fact, they wouldn't even acknowledge poor workmanship for the rubber piece and charged me repair cost for the whole thing minus 30%.  Please let your readers know what they are getting into if they buy a minolta product...as for me, I will never buy one again!", "Date": "April 1, 2004"}, {"Title": "some important \"cons\" to be noted", "Author": "Gideon Spiegel", "ReviewID": "R27I5X64RRK70T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading so many \"pros\" I must add some \"cons\":1 - Service - I bought my brand new camera on July 2003 used it fo 3 months and then it stoped functining - showing the \"error\" sign.I droped it to the Minolta representative in Israel 3.5 months ago, and have not received it back yet.Minolta Japan did not reply my e-mail.2 - You have to carry atleast 2 sets of extra batarries, because it \"eats\" them more than any other camera I have used.3 - When you compare the size in megabites of this camera's photos  with similar pixle photo made by another make - you may find that this camera use almost double amount of m.b. to create the same photo.", "Date": "February 9, 2004"}, {"Title": "Cons", "Author": "Gadget Geek", "ReviewID": "R3GFDMBCN1G28A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "You won't be disappointed by the quality photos the 7Hi will take.  If you're still considering buying this camera, consider other options as there are newer models.  Considering there are dozens of reviews on the product itself, here are the weaknesses that I've experienced:- Drains batteries.  The 7Hi uses 4 AA batteries.  If you're going on a trip, plan on bringing 4-8 extra rechargable batteries (at least 1800 mAH) and a battery charger.  One set of batteries should last at least 100 shots (without flash). Do not use regular alkaline batteries as the camera will go through them quickly (Maybe 50 shots).- Does not utilize highspeed CF cards.  I purchased a Lexar 512MB 40x CF Card, and did notice any increase in performance over the one included.- Many digital cameras now have video capabilities.  The 7Hi records videos in quicktime .mov format at a maximum length of 60 seconds.

I come from a manual-focus film background and this is my first digital. Overall, I am pleased with the results I get from this camera. I like the fact you can manual focus. Also, the ability to use filters such as a polarizer and black and white filters is a bonus. (This is one of my main complaints about  many point and shoots-no filter threads).The ability to shoot RAW and TIFF  files is also an important feature. I've gotten some great Macro shoots with this camera too. The overall image quality seems quite good. There is some noise especially at higher ISO. I am not too impressed with the landscape shots I've taken. Even at f8 it still seems that something is out of focus. The lack of depth of field markings on the lens does not help. You can not use \"Hyperfocal focusing\" techniques. Image quality in my opinion still can not touch film- especially slide film. I find too the autofocus is slow with moving subjects  So far I've had no major problems with this camera. Every now and then it does something weird but I just take the batteries out and reboot and it seems OK.It has many great features on it and, thus, is not for the inexperienced photographer unless you just want to shoot on program all the time and not use the extra features. Overall, a good camera. I would probably not buy one new but if you can pick one up used for a good price then I would recommend it over  a point and shoot style digicams or if you can't afford a digital SLR.", "Date": "June 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "it's just okay", "Author": "L. olave", "ReviewID": "R1WR1EPQ0LW924", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this camera just a little over a year and have made it through learning the modes in the rather large instruction manual and the one problem I have is not-so clear pictures!

This is not an entry level camera, and there is a learning curve, but the results are worth it if you use a decent photo editor, and print on high quality paper using a decent printer for your serious work.  I use Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0 (will be upgarding to 3.0) and print on a Canon i960.  I still use the Nikon when non-serious photography is appropriate.As for the negatives noted in the reviews, all Minoltas are notorious for draining batteries so at least one spare set of rechargeable high capacity NiMH AA's with a 15-minute battery charger are highly recommended.  Regarding the USB down-loading issues, my PC came equipped with a card reader, so I just insert the CF card into the reader and there are no USB issues as far as I am concerned.Eventually, when the technology reaches the 10Mp resolution stage, I'll upgrade for the last time, but until then, the 7Hi does the job very nicely.", "Date": "October 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "Not exactly what I paid for", "Author": "John Saladna \"JGS\"", "ReviewID": "R3F1HLE8ZK3JHU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Reasonable price, good flexibility but some focusing issues and a real killer-I get an \"error\" message frequently (perhaps 90% of the time by simply turning it on).

Needless to say, it will costs several hundred dollars to have it check out...The autofocus is far too slow by current standards, and shooting moving objects with autofocus is next to impossible. Although the zoom is a true manual ring/gear mechanism, the manual focus ring is electronic, and therefore not as tactile or responsive as a true SLR.The camera is quite a battery hog, so I nearly always run off an AC adaptor or an external battery back.The good things: Great image quality (when using low ISO). Convenient 7x optical zoom (300mm equivalent) Easy to use, with many onboard image processing options.

However the Dimage 7Hi has poor battery performance, USB 1.1 and the noise on the images for a camera this price call into question no matter how many manual buttons and options you can play with the final picture is of little if any improvement over the competition. Compared to the Sony F717 which has the least manual features it let the camera do the talking with its more advance faster USB 2.0, long life lithium battery, histogram that gets every picture focus rights in whatever lighting condition, excellent nightshots and with additional infrared filter add on can use as an Xray cam and to top it all a versatile Carl Zeiss lens.If you wants to buy the Dimage 7Hi and you dont mind all the controls then this might be the camera for you, the Sony F717 does not offer as much for you to play with but shoot faster yet both produces equally good pictures (Cons for the F717 is the slight red saturation, the Dimage 7Hi is the noises).My impression of an ideal digital camera is that it do all the hardwork for you, the Minolta does not handle all the hardwork itself but instead gave that back to the user, however I am not a professional photographer and like most mortal I like something that automatically handle most of the work and produces equally good picture as what the Minolta or Coolpix can do, this is what gave the Sony the edge for me.", "Date": "June 27, 2003"}, {"Title": "NICE CAMERA", "Author": "Rafael A.
