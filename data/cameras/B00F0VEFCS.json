But all the accessories that come with this kit are very cheap in quality. The tripod bent the very first time I tried to use it. The bag is as cheap as can be and provides no protection. The additional filters I'm sure are good to have but buy for the average person, these you will most likely never use.  In the stores like best buy, etc.  the camera with both lenses is the same price as this kit.  So it's still a great price. Just make sure you buy a better case and definitely a better tripod.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$799.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 14 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Sony Alpha NEX-5T Digital Camera Body & 16-50mm Lens (Black) + <2> Sony NEX E 55-210mm Lens + <3> Transcend 32GB SDHC 300x Card +\n<4> Spare NP-FW50 Battery + <5> Battery Charger + <6> PD-C20 Camera/Camcorder Case +\n<7> PD 50\" Compact Travel Tripod + <8> PD 2.5x Tele & .45x Wide Lens + <9> 40.5mm UV Filter + <10> 49mm UV Filter +\n<11> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <12> PD 8 SD Card Memory Card Case + <13> LCD Screen Protectors + <14> 40.5-58mm Step Up Ring", "Name": "Sony Alpha NEX-5T Digital Camera Body & 16-50mm Lens (Black) with 55-210mm Lens + 32GB Card + Battery + Charger + Case + Filters + Tripod + Tele/Wide Lenses Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61gpUt-UxzL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00F0VEFCS"}}
