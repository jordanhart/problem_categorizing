{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally arrived!", "Author": "Sprite Marie", "ReviewID": "R1DKJ32J6DYZFK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I first saw this camera on the Kodak website and I could hardly wait for it to be available. I admit that the camera is a bit over priced, especially for a 4 megapixel camera. Still, I think the features are really neat. I think part of the high price is because it has a touch screen but I really like that it rotates. Also, since I live in North Dakota and my sister lives in Texas, it's great that I can send her pictures with just a touch of a button. It's also great how the camera organizes your pictures and videos. Over all, I think I got a pretty good deal on the price. Kodak's website offered it with free shipping and handling, an included Wi-Fi card, a free picture viewer(a $100 value), and %10 off accessories. I only have a few regrets about getting this camera, it's quite heavy and it is a lot of new technology to learn at one time. Other than that, I'm looking forward to taking many more great pictures with it!", "Date": "October 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "Just What I Was Looking For!", "Author": "PK", "ReviewID": "R2WXO1BNO5H3ZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking to replace my current digital camera,a 5 year old Toshiba that has served me well, but memory is hard to come by and I am not really happy with the low light indoor pictures.What I was looking for was: 1 - More Mega Pixels (picture quality) 2 - Video with Audio 3 - Rotating Screen 4 - Smaller Size 5 - More Memory 6 - PriceThe Kodak Easy Share One fit all of my needs. 1 - Going from 2 mega pixels to 4 mega pixels has given me better picture quality. The low light indoor pictures are much better. And when printing pictures you can zoom in alot more without getting the distortion. Overall the pictures are very good. 2 - I was really impressed with the video quality. This little camera takes videos that are just as good if not better than the 8mm camcorder that I have (in good situations). Of course it does not have the video improvement features like image stability or additional lighting and it can't hold the length of video. But the benifit is to not have to carry around both a camera and a camcorder. 3 - It is really nice to have a screen that can be moved around. If you cant stand behind the camera or if you are taking a picture that includes yourself being able to turn the screen makes taking the picture very easy. 4 - The size of the Kodak Easy Share One is alot smaller than my old camera. It will easly fit into a pant pocket. It is not one of the smallest cameras made, but it is small. 5 - WOW 256 meg of on board memory. Thats more than the 6 memory cards combined from my old camera. Plus I got a 1 gig SD card for cheep ($23) and that can hold 28 min. of video or 800 pictures. 6 - Price, I did not want to spend over $200 and I was able to keep checking on-line daily until I found a sale and got it for $159. Thats pretty good for a camera that originally had a MSRP of $599.Not everything smells like roses. The bad points, if you know about them and are ready to deal with them are not that bad. 1 - Battery life. The battery life is not great it might even be below average. This camera does not have a view finder so the screen is always on. This uses up the battery quicker. I was able to take one days pictures and videos and view them, on one battery. But Kodak provides you with two batteries and a quick charger (2-3hr). I also bought a third battery. As long as you keep a second fully charged battery with you, you should be fine. 2 - Start-up Time. The time it takes for you to take the FIRST picture is on the long side (7-9sec). So you might miss a chance  to take an unexpected picture. Once the camera is ready you can take picture after picture really quickly.Extras -The large 3\" screen makes taking and looking at picture more ejoyable. The smaller screens on other cameras are hard to see.One feature that I have not used but to some could be a big selling point is the wireless conection. This camera has a wireless adapter that will alow you to transfer the pictures and videos to your wireless computer or over the internet.Overall I am really happy with the Kodak Easy Share One and I would recommed it to anyone.", "Date": "July 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "HiTech Camera - Great Price Now", "Author": "Ivan Morales \"Ivan M\"", "ReviewID": "R2GB4CYG3J8P3Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'd seen this camera last year 2005 and thought it was horridly overpriced.

Kenmir \"Camera Nut\"", "ReviewID": "R26C6HYB4LP6BK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are 6 and 7MP cameras that are selling for $300 or even less. The truth is, pixel quantity is just one feature to consider and not the most important feature either. How many of us are going to make prints larger than 8.5x11? Unless there is an issue with extreme cropping resulting in a large loss of pixels or very big enlargements, a 4MP camera is more than adequate. Also, faster processing and being able to store more images on media is a big plus.The Kodak EasyShare One is extremely pleasant to use and has a very nice set of features. One that stands out is the ability to crop a photo right on the camera and save it that way! (make it nice and toss the original.) Organizing photos is also a nice feature.Best of all, it takes really good photos. I also have a canon D50 digital SLR which I use when I want to get \"artsy\", but you can't beat the EasyShare for carrying around and taking snapshots. It's nice and small and when folded, the lens and LCD is completely protected from sctatches, dirt and fingerprints. Speaking of the LCD, it's a full 3 inches which is just really nice. You can see it in the direct sun pretty good too.I've used the WiFi for printing to a Kodak EasyShare printer dock with no problems. I have not done anything else with WiFi yet, so I can't comment.Quality is superb (a little heavy but a good feel to it).As far as comments by other reviewers as far as price, all I can say is \"you get what you pay for!\"", "Date": "October 31, 2005"}, {"Title": "A camera for simple folk.", "Author": "Jen Sanders", "ReviewID": "R2HJAM4O5W0B7U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok, I admit it.  I'm a simplistic person.  And this camera is pretty simple!  I've only had the camera a little over a week and have played with it just a couple times and I think I did pretty good with the photo taking - I have downloaded a few for your viewing pleasure.  I had several bad photos, but I don't blame the camera, I blame myself, I am just not familiar with the settings yet.  I love the huge 3\" crystal-clear LCD swivel screen!  It's great! And the onscreen displays are easy to use and very simple - there's a stylus on the camera to use on the screen if you need it, I am able to tap with my fingernail, however.  The swivel screen will come in handy for movie taking too!  One really nice thing for us simple folk is there are not that many buttons to mess with - this is a big plus for me!  I haven't tried out the wireless downloads yet but look forward to using the feature!  I had previously purchased a Canon SD600, which I'm sure is a great camera, but too many confusing bells and whistles for me!  I'm way to simple for all that.  This camera is heavier than the Canon - in fact, it's pretty weighty.  I will have to add this to the \"Con\" column but this camera's simple features, superior Kodak color and swivel LCD screen outweigh the weight issue.  Another thing I noticed is that this camera seems to have good image stabilization - the Canon had a really annoying image stabilization feature!  I got this camera for a great price - Amazon had it for $174 something and with free shipping, the total was like $182.  It came with two batteries and a wi-fi card, which can cost over $70 all on its own, and a nice leather case - a nice camera package.

I was so impressed with the camera and the pictures that it took, that I started reseach camera's.  I made a decision to send my JVC camcorder to my brother and purchase this camera for myself.  My sister in law video taped the children, took lots of wonderful pictures, the pictures of our ferry ride from Seattle to Bremerton were very beautiful and I was excited to order this camera.  I have had it for a month now and I have been riding around with it every day and taking all kinds of pictures just to see if the camera is in good shape because I purchased it used.  The camera is fabulous. It takes wonderful pictures, very clear and vivid pictures, I like the swivel view finder so when I am driving I can stick the camera out of my sunroof and turn the view finder toward me.  I like that you can take speed shots for sporting events, I like the night setting because the pictures come out really good.  It came with several batteries so I have no problem with the battery and I turn it off when I am not getting ready to take a shot. I am very satisfied and everyone loves the bright colors of the pictures.  One lady at work just received a kodak camera for Mother's Day and she says her camera does not take bright colorful pictures like mine.  I am in love and I am snapping every picture I can and using every feature I can to familarize myself with the camera.

First of all it protects the screen from the usual scratches of everyday use.  Secondly, it's great to preview photos from a users point of view.  Thirdly, when folding out the screen you can view the timer count down accurately from several feet away without guessing when the shot will be taken.I think there are a few small problems I can see is that it's bulky and a bit difficult to figure out the wifi feature.  I also lost the stylus very easily cuz it doesn't stay in the slot on the camera that well.  Other than that it's worked fine.I haven't been that impressed with any other cameras out in the market.  I had this camera for about 3 years and it's worked fine.  I accidently broke it and I couldn't imagine buying another camera.  Too bad kodak discontinued this awesome camera.  I still get compliments on it all the time and people still want it too.  If you find it, buy it!  I bought mine used and still love it.", "Date": "October 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good and bad, but too much bad...", "Author": "Trent Johnson \"trentuiuc\"", "ReviewID": "R2SHT2XYPCMC7G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "At first I was really happy with the camera. It takes decent pictures. The wireless feature worked (once you figured it out). It is very convenient to transfer the pics wirelessly from the camera to your computer. The battery lasted a decent amount of time (but if you insist on buying this camera, make sure you get an additional battery and charger). It takes great video, also. It has quite a bit of internal memory which is a good thing because it will not accept ANY memory cards! We tried TWO different Kodak brands and 2 other brands. Nothing worked. So, if you plan on taking a lot of photos or video, keep that in mind that you cannot find a memory card to work. (With no memory card I could take about 190 pics or a couple minutes of video)The other problem is that to turn the camera on you have to flip the screen open and then twist it. This resulted in a couple different problems. First, it takes almost 5 full seconds to flip it open and for the camera to turn on, more if it's not already in the picture taking mode. It was too slow for me. The second problem, and biggest problem, is that after less than a year the hinge in mine stopped working right. Instead of turning the camera on when you flipped the screen around, it turned it off meaning that the screen was always open and in danger of being damaged because it IS sensitive since it's a touch screen. The only way I could use my camera is if the screen was flipped open, left out to the side and facing the wrong way, meaning that I couldn't see the screen or what i was looking at (although the person I was taking a picture of got a nice preview of themselves). If I tried to keep the screen open and in the proper position then it would just turn off.One of the bothersome things about the wireless feature is that you have to run Kodak Picture Share on your computer before it will transfer any images. Again, a slight annoyance but I try to avoid unnecessary programs on my computer.The touch screen is useful, however if you lose the included stylus it's difficult to use. There is holder for the stylus on the side of the camera, but if you'd lose it I would imagine it'd be hard to find a relpacement because it's very small (about 3 inches in length). If you have large hands it's a little difficult to use.There isn't a viewfinder. The screen is nice and large but on sunny days it was almost impossible to see the screen. Also, unless you turn this function off it makes musical tones and sounds when you use the touchscreen or take a picture.I hope this helps. It did work good for a while but I think that all the moving parts in the hinge will eventually wear out quickly, like ours did, and then your camera will be rendered useless like ours was. Mine lasted only a year then kaput (I was very careful with it, always kept it in a hard case and all)! Too much money to only last a year. I expected better quality from Kodak.", "Date": "July 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Kodak... Photo Fashionistas....Ingenious Innovators...Bangers for Bucks...", "Author": "K. Gabriel \"Fresh2Death\"", "ReviewID": "R2UHRA40886FA0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, here's the sitch. I received my Kodak Easyshare One 4MP Digital Camera yesterday (December 12, 2007). When I got it, the box was heavy as hell so I was like Kodak is not playing this time. I currently have and use a Kodak Z760 which is 6 MP and 5x optical/digital zoom. So I charged the battery and got it ready to play with it. It came with two batteries, wi-fi card, 1GB SD card, a REAL tan leather case, dock insert, stylus, manuals, and cables. The camera was at the bottom. I pulled it out and started reviewing it. From first glance, it was gorgeous!! Elegant two-tone silver finish and this ivory-type material on the inside of the touchscreen. The buttons were chrome and there were several different green lights and switches on it. The screen was so vivid and clear and I was even able to see it perfectly outside without having to squint.I do photography on the side, so I wanted something with a decent amount of megapixels but not so much to oversaturate my computers memory and not too little to desaturate the picture when developed. 4MP is a good choice, because even though you can really print up 8x11 with these, if you have interpolation software or can enhance photos like I do, then I can make prints up to 11x14. Anyway, the features took a while to get used to. Being my other camera was 3 years old it lacked alot of the features the new Easyshare had. The Wi-Fi is a beast!!!! You set it once and forget it. If you leave and come back home it will recognize your wireless settings and simply continue use with the closest receiver. To use Wi-Fi simply pop the Wi-Fi card up and search for signals.The cropping software and and multi-zone features were really good. Letting you focus on a single object and zooming in on it without losing pixelation is perfect. There are many different modes to choose from and settings. I really like Exposure features which let you choose how you would like your picture to look--it have 100, 200, and 400, and automatic exposure levels with light level brightness and automatic white balance.Some may think the camera is a bit heavy but I love the way it feels in my hands and the swivel touchscreen is great for videos with very good sound. The video uses MPEG-4 so you can easily place your crazy videos or reviews on You Tube, Amazon, etc without compromising video quality. I transferred some videos to my computer and they were pretty clear for a digital camera. The sound quality is great and I didnt have problems with echoing or background noise (was watching the Dallas game in Surround Sound and still couldnt hear anything)I got a really good deal on the camera, way cheaper than 249 but I would say that is a good price for a camera with as many features and a name as reputable as Kodak.In a nutshell: Great camera, wonderful features, only Wi-Fi capability in digital camera industry, beautiful looks, great touchscreen, easy user interface, many options. The only thing I would like to see are new colors and dual flash with maybe two lenses (regular and panoramic mode). I cant wait for the Easyshare 2...

Sony's camera has even better image quality than that! All of Sony's camera gets good rating as Canon for good image quality. And this kodak camera only offers 4.2 MP for $629.99!? Geez, what a rip off! you could get that amount of MP with same image quality for less than $200!!!! Or you could just get kodak or other kind of digital camera with same resolution and get a 256mb of memory card for far less!!!!!! Wireless connection transfer? Huh!! To me this looks like another technological piece of junk that will soon be unpopular due to it's first generation!!!! You could get a prosumer camera for that much money that you'd have to pay for this from Sony, Canon, Nikon, or Olympus!!!! Those all four are great camera makers, but Kodak's image quality just falls behind them.", "Date": "October 10, 2005"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "4.0 MP captures enough detail for photo-quality 11 x 15-inch prints\nSchneider-Kreuznach C-Variogon 3x optical zoom lens\n256 MB internal memory stores up to 1500 favorite pictures\n3.0-inch (7.6 centimeter) rotating touch screen and stylus\nWireless for instant sharing with included Wi-Fi card", "Name": "Kodak Easyshare One 4 MP Digital Camera with 3xOptical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KW0B1DVBL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0007CZ6UU"}}
