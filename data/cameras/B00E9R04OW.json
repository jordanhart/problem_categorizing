This is the first time since giving up our old manual camera that we have been pleased with the pictures.  Camera has a large viewing screen, plenty of zoom power and a speedy reload.  It also includes a neat feature, when you can't decide if the flash is needed.  Camera takes two quick pics one with flash and one with out.  Great little camera at a very good price.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Geni", "ReviewID": "R1REE0VDAF0FA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has been great with the zoom lens and clarity of the pictures, I still have not figured out all the functions yet but it been great for what I have needed so far.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Save up for something else. (Possible defect)", "Author": "Coby", "ReviewID": "R1OGA81JU5P2RW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera was supposed to be my moms camera for Christmas, but she doesn't really use it all that often. Thus, I decide to play around with it and I find that it has terrible quality.BuildThe build of the camera is quite solid. Its very easy to hold and the buttons are easy to use. You have modes that can give you shutter priority  to making everything your own custom way. ISO, aperture, etc. In the program, I'd say its decent. It's a little slow. It takes 2 seconds to view old pictures, which I find to be slightly annoying. There is also a flash on the camera, but it feels like any other flash in any other camera. You can not replace the lens on this build.The build, hardware and software-wise, is decent overall.Picture/Video QualityThis is what I have a problem with. The camera is a terrible low-light performer, and still is a little terrible-ish in lighting in which its' average. I've tried every method and photos still look very grainy. I've tried to change the ISO count and it will increase the quality depending on the situation, but overall, the camera has a ton of grain. But is this a defect? Its questionable because there is only one other review of this camera that states it's great.OtherThe camera takes batteries which may be cumbersome to have but it has its pro's and con's. Carrying a bunch can take up space, but carrying it ensures that you'll still have juice versus cameras that require outlets. There is also an HDMI port and a lens cap that are pretty handy.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00E9R04OW"}}
