Let me save you the heartache. Not all megapixels are created equal. Do not buy a camera based on how many megapixels it says it has. It's the quality of those megapixels that count. If your camera takes bad megapixels you will have 7 million bad megapixels. This camera takes bad pictures. You can get a better camera with not very much more money.

While I love its size (small enough to slip into my pocket), there are a lot of things that are left to be desired:1. The buttons are hard to read/navigate. My mom was looking for a smaller camera to replace HER bulkier Kodak digital camera, and couldn't even SEE the buttons on the back of this camera. They're printed DARK RED on BLACK, which is next to impossible to read or see and the buttons are harder to press when you have larger fingers. Every time I press a button, I feel like I'm breaking the damn thing. I thought maybe a backlight on the buttons would remedy the problem, but the backlighting on the buttons only activates for about 1/10th of a second WHILE you are pressing the buttons. Even if you could see the buttons, the icons on the buttons make absolutely no sense at all.2. The memory card holder is cheap. My SD card slipped out no less than 3 times the first day I had this camera. The memory card didn't fall out of the camera completely, but just enough so that the camera couldn't read it and kept telling me \"OUT OF MEMORY.\"3. Flash quality is sub-par. It just isn't as \"smart\" of a flash as my Kodak. Most of my photos with flash end up with something stupid in the foreground REALLY BRIGHT in front of absolute darkness. In that same vein...4. Auto focus may be mentally challenged. The first few pictures I took were out of focus and for what seemed to be absolutely no reason. I messed with the different autofocus features, and then I had to hold down the button for an eternity while it decided what it wanted to focus on. I know it's a cheap camera, but my last camera was cheap and was still able to figure out how to focus.5. Image quality is crappy. As the other reviewer said, just because it says 7.0 megapixels, it doesn't mean that those 7 million pixels will be pretty. The color quality and edge qualities are horrible. The 'artifacts' and bad pixel blurs are unacceptable.All in all, I hate this camera. My mom bought a new small Kodak for $90 at Target's Black Friday sale, and I wish I had known about it, because I would have waited for that deal. Now I'm stuck with a bum camera whose only redeeming quality is that it fits in my pocket.", "Date": "November 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "MD", "ReviewID": "R3E5RCYHXR2FAI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was searching for something portable, cheap, large LCD screen, and which allowed me to customize my settings to my liking, such as shutter speed, exposure, flash, etc., much like my Canon DSLR. Turns out, this little camera has alot of nice features that I find extremely useful. I found that it has many pre-set features that are pretty cool to play with such as B/W, Vivid, Blue tint, etc (my favs). PLUS, you can even capture video with the camera, which is a huge bonus, since i found myself using it more than i had expected. All in all, there are too many features to list, but i would highly recommend, especially given the price for a 7MP digital camera with a 3\" display (which is very very nice).Pros: Lots and Lots of nice features, small and compact and very portable, good battery life, 3\" display that is superb, can capture both still and video, automatic and manual options, produces very nice photos and videos (for a $150 camera that is).Cons: key functions confusing at first, no view-finder (would save on battery power), LCD always on (even when not taking photos), software not the best, camera settings reset everytime the camera is turned off, image stabilization not the best.Verdict: my opinion is that the Pros far out-weigh the Cons. If I had it to do over, i would buy this camera again. While at home, i will still use my Canon DSLR over the Polaroid. Yet, when i travel, i will always take Polaroid, since i am learning to use it more and more each time.", "Date": "December 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Incredible for the price - CANNOT be beat", "Author": "Gray J Collins", "ReviewID": "R3RPA2B7KFN5KH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked up 4 of these on clearance, and decided to sell them here.  After reading all the horrible reviews, I thought to try one of them out and give them a chance.Result? There is nothing wrong with this camera.  It takes great pictures.The buttons are a little weird to get used to... but like with any new toy there is a learning curve and you will have to get used to it.  And yes, buttons are small, but THEY ARE SMALL ON ALL DIGITAL CAMERAS!  That one actually got me mad... apparently the people who complain about small buttons have never bought any electronics within the last 10 years... if you can use a cell phone... then you CAN use this camera without problem.Now about the focusing... I have 6 digital cameras, from this to a $2000 professional digital SLR.  Even the digital SLR needs a moment to focus!  This panasonic might take a teeny bit longer than my SLR... but not anything like others here would have you believe.  Again, I would suspect the negative comments are from users who have had more expensive cameras before using this one.  I uploaded pictures from this camera to the description above, so you can see there is no problems with focusing.As for dead pixels?  Give me a break!  With ANY LCD screen, they are a possibility.  You just return the product for a new one after you discover it had bad pixels when you bought it.And the \"not all pixels are created equal\" comments?  That is a load of rubbish.  A pixel is a pixel.  How the processor inside the camera interprets the pixels is another matter, and the one inside this camera is no different than any others-- all pretty much standard nowadays.Perhaps they were having problems with resolution... there is a setting called \"superfine\", and I suspect if you don't wait for the camera to actually FOCUS on something, you will get the blurred artifacts mentioned by others.Bottom line, I read all these negative reviews and was prepared to experience all the problems they mentioned... but when I took some pictures around my house there were no problems with using the camera at all.Even without knowing what buttons to press on the back, I was able to take pictures using the top shutter release button.I tried to reproduce any and all of the problems others have had with this camera, and can't find any.  I think I'll even raise the price I'm selling them for, as the pictures I've taken are perfect!", "Date": "May 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good photo quality but not the easiest to use", "Author": "Grace O \"book_in_each_hand\"", "ReviewID": "R7MZH7MX4FQPL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the Polaroid T737 because I was looking for a smaller camera than the one I have been using.  I have used it to shoot stills and video.  Both have worked fine.  I nearly always do some adjustment to the photos and video I take after I get them into my computer.  (The audio wasn't bad for such an inexpensive camera.) These were no different.  I find the 7 mp to be a giant step up from the 3 in my other camera.  The adjusting I do is much better because of it.  I don't like not having a viewfinder because this camera suffers from the same problem as all of the digital display -- pretty useless in the sun.  The button set up is interesting.  It took me a couple times using the camera to get used to the placement of them.  I suggest getting familiar with them in good light and then use them by touch until you are familiar with them.  It helps to have a good thumbnail -- not to short-- not too long!  I hate the 3 X 5 display of LEDs on the front of the camera.  They flash on each time you turn the camera on.  They use power and I can't figure out what they are for except to alert the subject that you are going to take a photo.  Now for the editing in the camera -- it really works and I love what it can do.  I've edited photos and then plugged the SD card into a handy computer and given the photos to relatives and friends already cropped and ready to go.", "Date": "January 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Perfect for my use of family photos", "Author": "Colleen Shimkoski", "ReviewID": "R1PNP1U3S79FX0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband purchased this for me before our holiday trip to see the grandkids.  It is my first digital camera.  I've been using my \"film\"camera for years and never delved into his digital cameras as I foundthem hard to figure out...he went with the high end cameras that really were hard for me to figure out.This camera has a fantastic auto shoot and the picture quality is fantastic.  When the kids are running and moving past I can put the camera out there and press and whatever runs by at that moment shines right through in perfect clarity.  It's quite amazing on motion shots as well as the more posed still shots we take of the family.I'm not one to try artsy photos.  This review is simply to let you know I figured it out without reading the manual and filled up a 2Gig memory chip I slid in there without a problem.  My 12 year old granddaughter fell in love with the camera while we were here and she had no problems operating it.  Our children also loved the clear photos and large viewer. I can't wait to share these treasures with them.Very enjoyable, easy and perfectly functional.The only reason it did not get the 5 stars is the screen often shows black when it's focusing in so I cannot see my subject until the shot is taken.  Hey...if it's no good I just point and click a few more... not really a reason for a whole star but they wouldn't allow me to knock just a half of star...honestly it should be 4 1/2 from me.Enjoy the journey...", "Date": "December 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not bad at all", "Author": "Leanne Clay \"robitussin217\"", "ReviewID": "R133B5ERG4C7TP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have very little experience with digital cameras and just got this for Christmas. If you want to take generic pictures the t737 will do it very well, especially when you learn to work your way around the manual settings. (I messed with it for an hour and have a pretty good idea) If you want to take artistic pictures you have quite a few options. I'm still messing around with the \"fireworks\" setting and getting those cool \"light streaks\" off the lights of my Christmas tree.I'm struggling to even get a picture without the flash enabled at night. It's too dark.One problem I had- make sure to charge your battery for a really long time for the initial use and save yourself the frustration of thinking you got a defective camera because it won't turn on unless you do.

The picture quality is really good and it takes great video clips.  If you're looking to spend a little amount of money on a camera that is pretty high quality, this is it.  The only bad thing I found with the camera was in the dark it's hard to see through the digital display window on the back, but in the sun, this camera rocks!  This camera is really durable as well.  I took it on a ski trip and fell several times and the camera was in my pocket, it held up very well and NEVER stopped working.  I love the camera and recommend it for a travel camera as it's about the size of a pack of cigarettes (a tad bigger) and fits right in a pocket.  There are also a ton of features on this camera and it's self explanatory, very EASY TO USE.  It would also make a great beginner camera if you wanted to give your teen something that he/she could use without worrying about the cost of a larger camera.I give the camera 5 kudos as I've had no trouble with mine and I've had it quite a while.", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Worthless junk", "Author": "David J.
