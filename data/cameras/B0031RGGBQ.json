I ordered it anyway hoping that those ppl just got a bad apple or they didn't know how to use it correctly. I just wanted something small enought to stick in my pocket, with a decent zoom and easy to use. It did have all that, but  Unfortunately the bad reviews were right. I charged it for over 24 hours, kept going back to check on it but it never fully charged. I was going to NYC for the day so I took it anyway. It kept freezing up just as I had read it might. It took 53 pictures before the battery died. Too bad too because it took great pics, very clear, easy to use, the zoom was great. But who needs a camera that takes days to charge? And the freezing up for no reason is just annoying and makes one wonder if one of those times it just won't turn on again. So don't waste your time with this one! I returned mine and ordered a nikon. Amazon was great, which is why I shop here. They accepted the return for a refund and no shipping charges!", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect for travelling. Amazing zoom!", "Author": "Twitch", "ReviewID": "R1SNF4C7QI14V7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a keen photographer and avid student traveller, I needed a camera that was small and light enough to be able to taken anywhere in a pocket and still  be able to take high quality photographs for a point-and-shoot camera. My previous positive experiences with the Kodak EasyShare V1273 led me to the EasyShare M580 when the V1273 died after a very productive life travelling all over the world.There are six items which I like about the M580.1. 8x optical zoom plus 5x digital zoom2. 14 Mega-pixels with a wide-angle lens3. The panorama-stitch function4. The long time exposure function (0.25 seconds up to 8 seconds)5. It is very light and small enough to be taken anywhere in a pocket6. For a good camera it is cheap enough for a student travelling budget (bought at US$99.99)Of those, the thing which really impressed me most about the M580 was its zoom. My previous Kodak V1273 had 12MP with 3x optical zoom (plus a further 5x digital) which was acceptable at the time, but not really sufficient for those close in photos from further away. So coming from the V1273 to the the M580 I was blown away with the combination of 8x optical zoom and 14MP!Portability is also a strong plus. The M580 is a perfect pocket camera and can be taken almost anywhere in a pocket, backpack, handbag etc. with no trouble at all.I can't think of any significant faults with the camera - the screen is bearable in sunlight and it is fairly easy to use straight out of the box for regular Kodak users. The only recommendation I would have for buyers is to remember to buy a spare battery. One battery is OK for about 3/4 of a day of heavy photography, or about 200 photos on a cold day.Overall, I am extremely pleased with the M580! It is a perfect point-and-shoot travelling camera, is very easy to use and takes great photographs with HD video capability.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sharp picture", "Author": "Sally", "ReviewID": "R39OAXU68H90X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this camera very much, the 14mp is great. The only bad thing is that you can not have the date you are taking a picture apear automatically on the photo after each shot.I like having the date on my photos, and with this camera, you have to go into the menu each time and put the date on each photo individually.My 10mp has this function where it is done automatically, and you can turn the feature on/off as you wish.Otherwise I think the camera is a good buy.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kodak Easy Share 580 Purple", "Author": "G Hardin", "ReviewID": "R13ZXC1H9LNB2C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an avid amature photographer. I used to have an all manual 35mm Pentax, but an arm injury limits me now to point and shoot cameras. I bought this camera to replace a 5 year old Canon that took great pictures but was sooo sloooow! Since I bought the camera a week ago I have taken about 100 pics and videos in all light conditions to see the quality of the pics. The pictures seem just as good as my old Canon, and the camera is fast, fast, fast!! I only gave it 4 stars for ease of use because the top buttons do not stand out well. But after playing with the camera for a couple of hours, I was able to activate one of the top four buttons by touch only. The 8x lens is excellent, and the 3\" screen works good in all but the brightest conditions (common with LCDs). I took some nighttime pics with a tripod and was very pleased with the results. So far the camera has not frozen, a complaint of other users. Battery life has been excellent so far. I havent tried the Easy Share, but I did try the automatic photo tagging feature, which looks for faces and tags them automatically with the name you type in the camera. That worked pretty good, even on my Black Lab! I cant believe this camera sells for $115. I had expected to pay $250+ for my next camera, but decided to take a chance on this one. Glad I did.

I am usually a Canon kind of gal, but I decided to try this Kodak Easyshare because the commercial sold me.I agree with all of these other people complaining about it freezing up. It didn't start doing this to me until a week after owning it. I took a few video clips and when I was playing them back for my friend it froze up every time. I had to take the whole battery out and put it back in for it to work again.Also I had the photos set to the highest resolution and the photos kept coming out pixelated which I believe people call \"fringing\". I don't know if I'm expecting too much from a little point and shoot camera..but I thought it would be better.The video was mediocre. It allows you to zoom while recording which is better than a lot of the other ones in this price range, but the picture becomes so crappy that you probably don't want to zoom anyway.Lastly the buttons were killing me. They were so small and difficult to press. Even the power button felt like it was sunken in and I had to press it really hard.I feel a little bad writing such a bad review...but I was so very disappointed and had to send it back. I am now looking into getting a Canon Powershot A3300. I hope I don't have similar problems with it.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best camera I've owned", "Author": "Anon", "ReviewID": "R1T808F31Q0UZF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

I love to take basic scenic photos and photos of my pets.  I'm not a photographer so I just want something basic.  My old Casio always did an excellent job but I wanted more MP to be able to print slightly larger photos.  I went with this because I liked the feature of being able to send the pictures straight to my Facebook and Flickr accounts.  Not only does this camera not take nearly as good of quality photos, but I found it extremely difficult to upload to Facebook and Flickr.  I live near an excellent view of Mt. Rainier and I spent about 25 minutes at one point trying to get a nice photo with it in the background.  My Casio ALWAYS got Mt. Rainier to show up in the background instantly. I finally got frustrated and took the photo with my cellphone and it showed up on my cellphone just fine.  But when I took the photo with this it couldn't do it.  Then when I wanted to upload I had to manually go in and select every photo individually to upload to Facebook and Flickr.  Then, it still didn't upload them! I ended up having to just upload them to my computer and manually do it. I can do that with any camera! I wasn't looking for a fancy camera going into this.  Just something simple to take cute pictures to show off to my friends.  So I returned it and will be upgrading my Casio, I should have just stayed loyal to them to start with.  I have had 2 Exilim cameras so far, I began purchasing them back when I worked at Radioshack when they were brand new about 8 years ago and have loved them ever since!  My original still works great as well as my second one that I purchased about 6 years ago.
