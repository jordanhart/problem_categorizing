This works good.  Installed a 2 TB SATA hard drive as that was the largest it says it supports.Pros:- Hardware setup was easy for it to be working.  Installing the hard drive took a second to figure out the brackets as they could go numerous ways but would only work correctly one way.- Connecting the monitor and the cameras was no issue.Cons:- The internal software is not great.  It did come with the latest firmware which was good.  However the firmware appears written very simply.  It is pretty easy to figure out.- The documentation is very limited also.- The external software to view the cameras is not very easy to set up and configure.  It says you can view directly from a web page, I tried that on numerous PC's.  Never got it to display video.  I installed the software and got that working on half the PC's in the business.  the other half would show connected but wouldn't actually display the video.- The tech support says 24/7 on the box but that is not accurate.  I tried to call numerous times to diagnose why some PC's would view the cameras right and never actually got through to anyone.  Also the website says they only work 9:30 (maybe 9) pacific to 5pm.- Playback to find an incident is limited also and requires downloading and then viewing, don't see how to just hit rewind and view it.Ignoring the cons, for the price, the system does record video and has actually helped already with an incident.They have just designed it to be harder to use than it need be.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "q see qs206", "Author": "Terry Thomas", "ReviewID": "R27L7DKN2G4JON", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "works without issue.

So far I am very impressed and happy that I bought this thing.  I bought my house about 5 months ago and when I met the elderly next door neighbor she told me that two houses on the block were burglarized.  I found out later that the burglaries happened 5 years ago, but the neighbor is old and she left that part out.  Anyways, I decided that I would like some security and did some research.  I read an article about this guy who monitored his house's security cameras from his Iphone and saw someone rummaging around in his house, called the police and the guy was arrested (I love stories like that!).  So one of my priorities was to be able to instantly look at all my security cameras from my Android phone.  I also wanted to be able to monitor my cameras from any computer, my laptop for example.  I also wanted LOTS of cameras, or at least the ability to hook up lots of cameras.  Also, since I don't have a security system installed just yet I wanted some kind on notification of detected motion in the house.  Finally I wanted value (hey, I just bought a house and those aren't cheap where I live: SF Peninsula).  After browsing Amazon for about 20 minuets I ordered the QS206.  I got it all configured in about an hour or more without too much difficulties.  The software is pretty easy to use and not too complicated (pretty basic really).  For some reason the mouse pointer did not show up at first, but after configuring some settings it shows up now, I don't know what that is all about.  I went to the Q-see website and searched the support page and did not find too much documentation.  Later, I googled \"QS206\" and found a product specific page for the QS206 (tinyurl.com/7gbrluz for easy reference).  Why they don't link their specific product support page directly from their main support page I don't understand, but whatever, I found it.  I used one of the PDF's from the site to easily walk me through the port forwarding process to connect my QS206 to the internet.  Later on I had to assign a specific LAN IP address on my router so if the power went out the router would assign the same IP to the QS206 so I wouldn't have to change the forwarded ports every time the power went out.  I figured out how to do that from my routers documentation.  My wife has an iphone and I have an Android.  Instead of using the android \"MEYE\" software that came with the QS206 I downloaded \"MEYE\" from the market on my phone.  It did not work, so I went and downloaded the vMEye software and it works great (after a phone restart).  My wife's Iphone worked great after restarting her phone.  The QS206 comes configured to automatically record upon detecting motion, and it is pretty easy to set up the areas you want to trigger recording.  As for the internet monitoring be advised that you have to change the security settings in Internet explorer to allow it to download and install the ActiveX software when you go to look at your cameras from any computer.  For me this means that I can't monitor my cameras from my work computer because there is no way that my company will allow the security setting to be changed or lowered on my work computer.  So for me at work I can only monitor my cameras from my phone, which was a little disappointing but understandable.  There are other ways to broadcast video feeds that I can see on my work computer, mainly splicing the camera signals and sending them to a server that broadcasts streaming video (but that is outside the scope of this review).  The monitoring software does work great from my laptop at home via the LAN or anywhere via the internet.  From the laptop I can configure most of my system and watch recorded video.  For some reason there is no rewind button when you are watching a video, but you can easily download the specific video to a flashdrive and watch it from your computers video player.  I bought a 1TB hard drive to install and put in in with no problem.  Overall I think this is a 5 star product and a great value.NOTES:-Use this site (tinyurl.com/7gbrluz) to get the latest documentation and walk-throughs for the QS206.-The documentation says that you need IE8 to view the cameras from your computer, but that info must be outdated because IE9 works flawlessly.-You can use firefox to your cameras but you have to install an add-on (IE TABS I think it's called).  I had to try 2 different add-ons to find the one that worked.-For droidx the MEYE software did not work, but the vMEye software works great.-If I think of anything else I will update this review.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exactly as described!
