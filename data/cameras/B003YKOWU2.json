I'm extremely savvy with computers and yet this is nearly impossible to import pictures.  Ridiculous.  If you want your kid to just take pictures, there's cheaper out there and if you want to see them on a computer, DO NOT GET THIS.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheap camera, go buy a throw-away and save much more money.", "Author": "Raychel Ray", "ReviewID": "R1HPDXVU34S78F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The screen is barely large enough to see pictures that are taken, and the flash is way too bright for taking indoor pictures. Poor quality photos that are uploaded to the camera, and you can't insert a memory card anywhere. That means you can only take a staggering total of 11 pictures. I would have gotten a better deal on a throw away camera, because the batteries (which were NOT included) drained fast, and now it won't even turn on anymore with new batteries.Sorely disappointed. Do not buy this product, it's garbage.", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this one", "Author": "A. Krupa", "ReviewID": "RXM5SWMUZX6J7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "At $28 I was not expecting high quality, but I did want something simple for my 8 year old's birthday present.I purchased this one and will be heading back to the store to return it today. It is a P.O.S.It says it takes over 100 photos and has 3.1 Mega Pixel resolution. No card needed, the usb cable provided goes right to the computer. Sounds fine right?Well you have to make a tradoff and reset the preferences. At the standard 3.1 MP resolution, it only took 8 (yes EIGHT) photos. If I want more photos, duh, well I have to reset the resolution.The programming is tedious (changing settings).The display screen is crummy. The settings are not intuitive. I read the manual (provided on the accompanying CD Rom) and have decided hands down this is NOT an appropriate camera for an 8 year old - nor for anyone.Don't waste your money.I think I'm going to get her a disposable digital camera and wait to buy a better quality camera later.The camera is cute (pink) and that's about all I can say about it that is good. Sorry Vivitar. I'm not coming back to you again.", "Date": "January 28, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003YKOWU2"}}
