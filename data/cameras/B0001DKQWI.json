The advantages of the C-60 over the C-50 are:-6 megapixel instead of 5 (not a huge deal if you're not printing anything bigger than 8x10s)-Movies have audio (C-50 video only)-Casing designed better (C-50 rubber flaps were always coming loose)-SuperMacro mode as close as 4cm (C-50 macro mode was horrible, only about 20-30cm focus minimum)-Mode dial more closely resembles other SLRs, with P/S/A/M options instead of having to navigate (C-50) through the digital menu to specify whether you want the shutter speed or aperature to be adjustable-Supports up to 512MB xD cards by default (C-50 supports only up to 128MB unless you ship it to Olympus for them to install a BIOS update)-Lens opens/closes more quickly (C-50 took 3-4 seconds)-Better LCD review screen-Supports higher capacity 12B Lithium battery instead of just 10BAnd it's still the nice small size that fits in my pocket when I travel.", "Date": "July 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "buy it", "Author": "Caraculiambro", "ReviewID": "RPPCA61DA2X1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently fell into a river and irretrievably destroyed my C-50 (not Olympus's fault, obviously).  Having been so happy with that one, I immediately replaced it with the C-60.  What follows is a comparison between the two, in the form of a user review I wrote for the C-50:[The C-50 is] a very powerful, versatile, and impressive little camera.  For taking shots in conditions of plentiful light, this camera was hard to beat, at least when it came out (it's since been discontinued).  When it hit the market, it was unquestionably the most powerful digital camera of its size.There are problems, however:1.  On the little movies, there is no \"sound\" available.2.  You have to turn the camera off and close the cover to review the picture you just took!3.  This camera cannot take pictures in low lighting conditions at all.  Not without the flash, at any rate.  Starting from about the late afternoon on, this camera is all but useless for natural-looking shots.  They'll be far too blurry; this is a constant annoyance.Olympus recently came out with the C-60 Zoom, which is the new version of this camera.  With that one, they have fixed problems 1 and 2 but not 3:  still a major problem, but this is not the only brand of digital camera with this problem.Also note:  if you're replacing a c-50 with the new c-60, you'll be able to use your batteries, your battery charger, and your memory disks with the new version.  You'll also be able to recycle the little cable that connects the camera to your USB port.Also, the C-60 can take memory cards of up to 512 MB!  This is pretty impressive (on the highest-quality setting, for example, this will allow you to take 118 pictures; on the lowest-quality setting, 6390!), although that's a pretty expensive little card.  With the C-50, coming out of the box the most it would take was a 256 MB card, unless you bodily sent the camera in to Olympus for a \"firmware upgrade,\" which was free if you provided proof that you had bought a 512 MB card.  This is not necessary with the C-60.Two pieces of advice:One, despite the vast memory attainable with the 512 MB card, I would suggest merely buying two 256's.  This is because, with this camera, the manner in which the card is inserted seems to increase the possibility of fatal scratches.  And if you have all your eggs in one basket -- thousands of pictures on a single card -- and you get that \"CARD ERROR\" message, you'll be up the creek, my friend.Second:  when you're buying it, you'll probably want to stock up on a few extra batteries.  The technology with the memory card and the image resolution is nothing short of astonishing, but it's surprising that the technology of these rechargeable batteries is not further along by this point.  The batteries only last a couple of hours before they need to be recharged!  If you're out shooting pictures all day, it's much more likely you'll need a new battery long before you'll need more memory.  Keep this in mind.", "Date": "November 29, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great camera, weak flash", "Author": "Scott Rose \"Computer Geek\"", "ReviewID": "R1WM993I1EBSMZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Strengths: Very compact & light, quick startup (slower with bigger XD Media cards), lots of great features (like continuous shooting mode and red-eye reduction), long battery life.Weaknesses: Weak flash, red-eye reduction not available in continuous shooting mode, slow startup with big XD Media cards.Summary: This is overall a great camera (see list of main strengths above). My biggest complaint is that the flash is pretty weak, and cannot be brightened in \"auto\" mode. However, if you switch the camera to one of the manual modes, you have more control over the brightness of the flash -- but I've found that increasing the brightness washes out the subjects too much. So you're stuck between a rock & a hard place. The perfect flash I ever used was on a Nikon Coolpix 995 camera, but that camera is big & bulky & slow compared to this camera. So if you're going to be doing a lot of daylight shooting or outdoor shooting that doesn't require heavy use of a flash, this camera is for you. If you're doing a lot of nighttime or indoor shooting (like me), you'll be hard-pressed to get rid of this spritely little camera that's chock-full of features, and instead you'll find yourself turning on lots of overhead lights to flood more light into the room.", "Date": "June 23, 2004"}, {"Title": "Almost Perfect", "Author": "noby29504", "ReviewID": "R2UV0MIMSQ4EY6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the third Olympus camera I have owned, with the last one being a C50. Overall, I am very pleased with the camera.PROS:1. Great metal body. Very sturdy and fashionable2. Takes great pictures for a point and shoot. Bright pictures and the color is very good3. Nice size. Can fit in a pocket, but you will notice it, but easy to carry around at parties and family functions.4. Simple point and click if you want, or you can customize almost all aspects of a shot. It's the best of both worlds.5. Great camera for the price. A ton of value at 300 bucks.CONS:1. Load time when turning camera on with a large memory card is very slow. Plan on waiting 5 seconds for the camera to enter \"ready mode\" with a large memory card.2. Could do better at taking wide angle shots. Canon is better in this area.Overall, I recommend this camera for those looking for a great point and click camera.", "Date": "December 31, 2004"}, {"Title": "Olympus has done it again", "Author": "Duane L.

Why blame the camera? I find the picture quality excellent. Haven't used all of the features, but that's because Ive been too lazy to read the manual. The only problem Ive had is turning the camera off when I change settings.  I need to learn not to get my fingers in the way of the front cover. I read a review of someone not liking the battery.  I guess if I was isolated from electricity for a month, I would have a problem. But I put my battery on the charger at the end of the day when I have taken alot of pictures. I took a few viedeos with the camera and was surprised of the quality.  I use a Sony DVD ($799) camcorder for videos, but for a shorty, the C60 performed well.

The other cameras take NiMh AA batteries and I've got a bunch of those so I can carry a lot of spares. If I kept the C-60, I'd have to buy 1/2 dozen spare batteries.

The zoom is about 12X, very good for taking close-ups; the design is compact, attractive and strong; it has a dial on the top that allows you to change from one mode to other in seconds, so easy!. The menu inside the camera is organized and easy to understand. The video mode is ok, obviously it doesn't replace a camcorder, but it is pretty accurate.

Larson \"rabeccajane\"", "ReviewID": "R103KH5RBB8ZJD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First let me say, I am a longtime devoted customer of Olympus and have owned several of their pocket cameras, going way back to the original XA-2 model in about 1979-80.  I have found my older Olympus digital a pleasure to use, it gives me surefire results, and it has been reasonably reliable despite less than optimum working conditions (two small children in the house.) I decided to replace it with something smaller and more powerful, and since I had Amazon gift certificates to use, I purchased it through Tiger Direct/Amazon.The first frustrating thing was that in the 10 days or so it took to receive this camera, it went down in price by $40 through another vendor featured on the site.  It has gone back up, but still--this left a bad taste in my mouth!I thought I had researched pretty well before purchasing this camera. Initially, I was very pleased with the ease of operation.  It is (naturally) faster and more powerful than my 4-year-old C-2020.  It shares the same basic commands and setup, so the learning curve was minimal.  However, I was expecting the photos to be dramatically better.  I would say they were about the same, and some were more blurry than I would have expected.  Maybe I had finessed the focus on my old camera, or maybe there was something wrong with this one, I don't know.  I was not blown away by the image quality, and as others have mentioned, the flash really is weak.  This camera performed best for me in natural light, where I was able to get good closeups as well as scenic shots.More distressing, it didn't even last a month!  On the last day of preschool, I dropped it--gently--from knee height.  The shutter button popped off, never to be seen again, and the door to the USB port would not shut.  (Sadly, I did not realize the extent of the damage until kindergarten graduation, which I therefore didn't get on film--BOO HOO!)Now, I realize this was completely my fault and I take the blame for dropping the camera.  However, these point and shoot models do take some abuse, and I've seen other models survive much worse.  This was a relatively minor bump, and the camera is virtually totalled.  It is obviously not covered under warranty, and I can't return it.  I sent it to Olympus and was quoted 2/3 of the purchase price to fix it.  I don't think that will be happening!  My next camera may still be an Olympus, but I'll definitely buy locally with a generous extended warranty, as I have in the past.
