This camera has a super range in that department.  I can go from 25 mm to 1200 mm in nothing flat by using the zoom lever by the shutter button.  What is really nice is I can fine tune the zoom by using the zoom ring located around the lens barrel.  The best wildlife pictures are many times taken in low light.  I have an oriole picture taken at 3200 ISO that turned out totally acceptable. I have 2 very good DSLR's and a $1700+ lens for them.  They have mostly been sittin in my safe since I got the HX300. That tell you how much I like this camera.  I read a couple of reviews that made me wonder if I should buy this camera or not so I bought it from Amazon so I could be sure I could return it without trouble if I didn't like it. Return it! They would have to come and take it from me!!Yes, I would recomend it to a friend.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is an excellent point and shoot...", "Author": "Glen Hurley", "ReviewID": "R1056S20VKBH0S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The zoom is amazing! Double what I can get out of my expensive SLR...But it has it's flaws. The camera has lots of extra functions and controls, but the instructions are pretty lame and almost non existent. The speed that it processes pictures is kind of slow, so you have to wait for it to process for a few seconds while it blocks the screen. So, not the best for action shots. Although it does work for a single staged photo... Say you are photoing a swing at a baseball game. You'll get the hit, but the play will be over before you can take any additional photos. The video works well. Very stable. And the zoom is active while filming. ( Its not on my other camera) So you can get some nice video. All in all its a very good \"one stop\" camera. I bought it to take on vacation so I dont have to lug around my big camera, all the lenses, AND a video camera.

Sony really should have included one in the box), the gadget bag is barely large enough to hold the camera and maybe a couple of memory cards (I bought a medium-sized Sony-branded bag separately), and the \"flexible tripod\" is useless (I threw it away), the DVD on digital photography is generic, not Sony-specific, so pulling up the online user's manual will be a lot more instructive. That reminds me, again Sony skimped here ... the included camera documentation is minimal and inadequate for familiarization with the camera. Also, Sony might have drilled a hole in the lens cap and put a string through it for attachment to the camera carrying strap or lens so it won't drop off and get lost ... I bought a non-Sony, tethered lens cap separately. These are my nits, none detract from the value of the camera itself.I decided to buy this camera simply because I was looking for a competent, light-weight alternative to my Canon EOS DSLR, which generally involved lugging around a heavy gadget bag full of interchangeable lenses on my frequent globetrotter trips, and I wanted an extreme zoom lens for occasionally shooting birds, wildlife and other targets of opportunity at significant distances. Adding a Canon super-telephoto lens to my inventory would have further increased the weight to be carried, not to mention that it would hardly have been cost-effective considering the questionable amount of use I would have gotten out of it. After scouring the reviews of the Canon SX50, Panasonic Lumix FZ200, and the Sony DSC-HX300, I chose the latter, ultimately because I had always loved my now almost \"ancient\" Sony DSC-R1 with its priceless Carl Zeiss optics. I've only had the HX300 for about 3 weeks and have not been able to test it extensively in the field, i.e., on one of my trips, which often yield thousands of photos. Rather I've used it indoors, in front of the house and in my back yard and on short drives. Thus far, I can only say that I have not been disappointed. The Carl Zeiss f/2.8-6.3 24-1200 mm Vario-Sonnar T* optics produce tack-sharp images, especially at the shorter focal lengths, but even my moon shots that I eagerly attempted almost as soon as I got the camera out of the box, turned out to be unexpectedly good, especially after improving brightness and contrast in Photoshop a bit. AF is fast and precise even in low light (although holding the Moon in steady focus initially proved a bit challenging), color rendition is excellent, and the camera is especially competent in the Intelligent Auto mode. In fact, even though I prefer shooting in either aperture or shutter priority, depending on lighting conditions and subject, I found that using intelligent auto often produced better results. I do miss being able to shoot in RAW, but the 20.1 MP Jpeg images are generally exceptionally crisp. When they're not, it's always my fault, not the camera's. I have not shot videos with the camera, except to try it on a CNN TV newscast, and the image quality, again using intelligent auto, under these low-light conditions, simply amazed me. i did not want to make this a lengthy \"technical\" review because of my rather limited experience with the camera at this time, but I may update it later, after my next \"photo safari.\"", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelent product and provider", "Author": "Gerardo Nizetich", "ReviewID": "R3P710JZ0JOKSJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product: Excellent product, quality and accessories are right and a great relation product-price.

I had it mounted to my tripod and when zoomed the lens seems to jitter and would not take a smooth picture. Even in the same focal length as my HX100 it fell short.

D.", "ReviewID": "R1QOZBE2GNDF88", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have published a much expanded review based on my experiences with this camera so far here:Sony DSC-HX300/B 20 MP Digital Camera with 50x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black). Includes: 8GB Memory Card, Memory Card Wallet, Extended Life Replacement Battery, Table Top Tripod, LCD Screen Protectors, Cleaning Kit & Carrying CaseHowever this was my original review.I am interested in architecture where getting \"up in the air\" to photograph details on tall structures is just not possible. My old Panasonic with it's x18 zoom did pretty good at getting result from on the ground though, but the x50 zoom on this one is just too tempting.However it has taken me three months of research to finally decide that carrying a DSLR with all it's lenses everywhere I go - Just in case I see something of interest, is just not going to be practical for me sadly. The saying \"The best camera is the one you have with you\" (attributed to Andrew Harvey) has proved very true for me. There is no point in having a wonderful camera if carrying it with you all the time is not practical and you stop doing it. So it had to be a fixed-lens camera for me after all. This Sony just about wins over it's competitors for my needs.However, there are two massive drawbacks for me with this camera - No GPS and no RAW shooting. Those alone almost stopped me. Three further problems (but more minor ones for me) are no Wi-Fi, no hot shoe and no external mic & accessory sockets.Most of these I cannot do anything about, but I have been delighted to discover that at least you can add Wi-Fi to any camera by using a combined Wi-Fi and memory card in it's memory card slot:http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&field-keywords;=wi-fi+sd+memory+cardAmazon offer quite a selection. I have only just discovered that memory cards with wireless Wi-Fi exist (8GB or 16GB are common, all rated 10 for speed, so more than fast enough for most, if not all current digital cameras).Today I wondered if it were possible to also add GPS to the memory card?  It took quite a bit of searching as I cannot seem to find a card with true GPS facilities, but I did find Eye-Fi cards like this one:Eye-Fi 16GB Pro X2 SDHC Class 10 Wireless Flash Memory Card Frustration Free Packaging EYE-FI-16PC-FFIt is 16GB and again class 10 for speed. It has Wi-Fi built in as well, but also note that they seem quite modest about it automatically adding GeoTagging information to every photo you take.  It is compatible with the Sony:[...]Reading the comments for the card, it seems that most of the criticisms are that you need to be near your Wi-Fi for it to work quickly and that you might have trouble with direct connection? (as soon as the card gets power, it starts to transmit your pictures immediately over the Wi-Fi if it is in range). I suppose you would not need direct connection under those circumstances though anyway. The limited range is understandable, since the aerial inside the card is shielded by the body of the camera itself.It does slow down your camera starting up and that might stop me from having it as my default card in the camera all the time. The problem seems to be that it searches for a wireless access point each time it is turned on. I might have to get two cards then, this Eye-Fi card for when I am visiting somewhere I am not very familiar with and a normal card for when I am somewhere familiar, but need to take a quick shot.So sadly not a perfect solution, but a possibility to consider if the lack of wireless connectivity or GPS is important to you? I just wish Sony would LISTEN to what the reviewers are saying, if only they would have built these in to the camera from the start, it would have had no real competition then. In camera special effects are nice toys, but really, how often are you likely to use them compared to RAW and GPS?I guess like most people, the rapid increase in speed of memory cards has left me with a nice little collection of still-useable cards (and once very expensive), but that are a bit slow now for regular use. So I am trying to \"future-proof\" my next memory card by getting one with plenty of memory, but outrageous speed that should keep it useful for a few years, hopefully until the card itself is wearing out:SanDisk Extreme Pro 64 GB SDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 95MB/s SDSDXPA-064G-AFFPBut you might want to consider paying a few cents more for the full retail packaging as there seems to be a few suspicions in the 1-Star comments that the memory cards they have received in frustration-free packaging might not have been genuine?I have also found a partial solution to the lack of a hot shoe.  There are slave flashes that are guaranteed to work with your digital camera anyway, such as this.Swivel, Bounce & Zoom Slave Flash With Flash Bracket For The Sony Mavica MVC-CD500 CD1000 CD350, DSC-HX1 DSC-H20/B DSC-H20, DSC-TX1 T90 WX1 W230, ALPHA DSLR A700 A300 A350 Includes Bonus Mini Tripod & Exclusive SSE Micro Fiber Cleaning ClothAlthough not as good as having a proper shoe built in to the camera from the start.  One of the slave flashes available that are compatible can help a lot with close to medium range shots that would need ISO400 or over as the grain really begins to show with this camera at that speed. Mine works like a dream with the Sony and with it taking 4 x AA batteries, it does not drain your precious camera battery either.I hope you enjoy your camera whatever model you decide to get.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camer and bundle", "Author": "Robert L Garrow", "ReviewID": "R3TAGHDZ4XEIQG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The quality is fantastic!!
