It does not have the capabilities, image size or cost of the T3i.  Be sure to compare apples to apples when looking at this. There really isn't anything wrong with the camera, just be aware of what you are buying.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "To see product details, add this item to your cart.
