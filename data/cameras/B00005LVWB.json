The DSP is \"guessing\" what pixels belong where.  Fortunately the DX3600 has 2x _optical_ zoom (alas, the little sister model DX3500 does not).  You can go to 6x with digital zoom, (and the .1x the zoom stepping is nice), but you'll start to see blurriness, pixellation, and x-mas lights effects.  Up to 2x looks great.The movie mode is such a fun feature... great for those times when a picture just isn't enough.  The DX3600 records at 320x240 or 160x120, 20fps(!), with audio!  And limited only by your memory capacity (I can get up to 15 minutes on my 64MB card).  You can't use zoom or flash when recording, so lighting is a concern; but I've taken movies of a Japanese sushi chef slicing an egg with his spatula in low hotel restaurant light, and it came out beautifully!  :)The software blue-screened Windows 2000 on me twice during installation (which NEVER happens... my W2K system is a ROCK)... although it has worked perfectly during regular use. (or else the camera would have been returned already!)  When plugged in to the USB cable, you can use the Kodak software, or the camera simply appears as a drive under My Computer.  Nice!This camera has MADE me a shutterbug!  I didn't even own a film camera before this purchase.  And on my recent trip to San Francisco, I snapped 275+ pics & movies!The beautiful LCD screen (viewable even in bright sunlight), ease of use (the ultimate in point and shoot!), good battery life -- I recommend the 1600mA Rayovac NiMHs -- great macro shots, video out (how many \"low-end\" cameras have that?), and very nice-looking photos (what we're all after, in the end!)

I bought it sight unseen, based on some excellent reviews. Even though the DX3500 has been out for a few months, the optical zoom and movie capability was enough to make me wait for the DX3600.My first reaction was that the DX3600 was too light to be a serious camera. My first hi-res 8x10 print was enough to change my mind. The outdoor color saturation was very good. Indoor with the builtin flash is suitable for snapshots only.The 8MB builtin memory will hold 10 hi-res or 40 low res photos. You'll want to pick up a 48MB or larger CF card. The internal memory is not cumulative with the flash card, but there is a way to copy photos from one to the other.Buy the docking station. Yes, it's way overpriced. You get a rechargable battery set which is much better than the expensive lithium AAs that come with the camera. (The docs say that alkalines won't work well). Even more important is how easy the docking station makes transfering photos. Very similar to a Palm hotsync.", "Date": "July 19, 2001"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Matthew Burchard", "ReviewID": "R3LMKCFOCIU5G4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To tell you the truth, the DX3600 is an absolutely great camera for the price. The first praise for the camera would have to be its image quality. The quality is excellent. I printed out an 8 by 10 photo and was utterly surprised by the detail in the picture. The optical zoom is great too, it dosen't degrade the quality of the pic at all. I wouldn't recommed using the digital zoom option. Though most people say that the flash could be stronger, I think that the flash is great. It creates the perfect lighting without burnout (Super white in the middle of the piture) like many digital cameras do. The movie mode is an awesome added bonus to the camera. You need to have good lighting to film in movie mode. I'd also recommend getting at least a 32mb flash card. With it, you can take up to 49 highest quality pictures. The menus of the camera are simple, making the camera easy enough to use to where a 7 year old could operate it. It's the perfect family camera. The battery life is about 150 pictures with RAYOVAC 1600mAh rechargeable batteries. The camera is made of plastic, yet I'm surprised at how sturdy it is. I was carrying much things in my hands including the camera when the camera fell 3 or 4 feet onto my tile floor. I examined it an found no scratch, dent or crack. I then tried it out and it still worked like a charm. Thank you Kodak.My only complaint for this camera is that it induces much noise into the picture when the flash is not used in low light conditions. Overall, I think that this camera deserves a 5 star rating for its ease of use, quality, and durability.", "Date": "December 24, 2001"}, {"Title": "Kodak is back !

A great value and easy to use.  Takes great pictures and videos (320x240) with sound (NOTE: With the 2x2 LCD screen they can be reviewed, edited, copied, & deleted).  Easy down load capability to your PC with the provided software.  (NOTE: Kodak has an entire stand-a-lone System (no-PC required)to include the; Camera Dock, Personal Picture Maker 200 printer & Kodak Photo paper available see my reviews).

Has 8MB internal memory (12 hi res pictures or 30 seconds of video w/sound).  Additional Memory can be provided by Picture Cards. (Note: I recommend a 96MB card this will provide an additional 140+ pictures!!!!  Remember you can review/edit/delete pictures as you go).  The DX3600 comes with rechargeable batteries (good for 30 - 50 pictures per charge / depending on your LCD use).  (Note: I recommend you take extra AA batteries (DX3600 uses 2)for long photo shoot outings !!!) The Camera Dock option is a great unit to include on your trips.  The DX3600 also comes with a USB cable for PC hook & an audio/video cable for TV hook-up!!!  This way you can all see immediate picture results.  (NOTE: you have a slide show feature in this camera.

IMHO a digital camera's ability to take close-up photos is a good indication of the overall quality of the camera ( based on the premise that ALL digital cameras can take decent photos of people, buildings, cars, etc ). The first picture I took in macro mode 6X is shown at ... ... and a picture of a quarter  and for what I want to use the camera for it's a good quality picture ( both pictures have been cropped and reduced ). The focal distance to an object in macro mode has to be between 10\" and 24\" with the DX3600 where other more expensive cameras you can get closer because of a high quality lens. Kodak does make 5X & 12X close up lenses ( which can be piggybacked to 17X ) for about $35 which would greatly increase the effective close up range of the camera and detail of the pictures. I plan on ordering the close-up lens kit shortly. Tomorrow I plan on getting out and trying my hand at \"normal\" shots and see how they look - from the examples at the review page at Steve's Digicams it appears to be very effective in that respect. This camera has 8MB of internal memory - with additional memory being supplied by compactflash modules. Another nice feature of the camera is it's ability to take full motion video clips! All in all for the price it's a nice entry level 2.2 megapixel digital camera. Why did I go from a Sony to Kodak - well the Sony had too many bells and whistles ( I am no macho-techno nerd when it comes to cameras and I want nothing to do with fooling with f stops and all the other settings) for what I need to do with a camera ( maily take photos for ... and outdoor photographs while traveling ) the Kodak seems to be exactly what I need AND the price was right.", "Date": "July 22, 2001"}, {"Title": "My first digital camera", "Author": "\"fmhwong\"", "ReviewID": "R3DX5UHYBMX8W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "DX3600 is a very cool digital camera.

I was never able to get stand alone AA NiMH batteries to work.If you have a dock, this seems to help:  Place the camera on the dock and wait for the light to go from red to green.

I loaded the pictures into webshots.com screensaver, and everyone who comes over to the house sits and stares at it - it's great.

The ability to take digital movies is a plus - the movies are a bit grainy even on high resolution setting, but it's more than I was expecting. I put the digital pic's and movies on our web site. I also sent some into ofoto.com to be developed.  They turned out nice although quite a bit darker than what we see on the monitor. But you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between them and a 35mm pic - no grain. The batteries that came with it died after about 200 shots + several minutes of movies, and plain old AA's are not cutting it - they don't seem to have enough power.

This is my first foray into the digital camera world and it was super tough leaving my EOS Rebel at home. I'm used to the 28-300mm zoom lens and shooting shot after shot quickly. I bought the 3600 in March 2002 and this was my first real \"test\" with it. Both good and bad...First the good: When I returned last night I loaded all 253 shots into my Mac Powerbook using iPhoto. Loading and previewing the images was a snap! Probably over 95% of the shots were good. It took a few shots for me to properly steady my pics, but I did. I really enjoyed the ability to immediately see what I had shot and determine whether to keep it or not, although in the bright sunlight seeing images in the display is difficult. I like simply putting another compact flash card into the slot instead of changing film every 24 shots or so. I had taken the camera to a friend's wedding a month earlier and found that the flash is only good for about 8-10 feet or so. So, for distances over that, turn off the flash. You will be surprised how well the shots turn out.The bad: From what I had experimented with earlier, there really is a lot more light out there that one would imagine. But, this meant turning off the flash each time the camera was turned on. Yes, that's right, with digital cameras, unlike my EOS, I had to turn it on each time I wanted to take a pic. We stopped by a park on the way to eat lunch and after taking a few initial shots, I left the camera on while I ate a sandwich. Batteries totally unusable. I had to switch to the backup set and put the others on charge.  Being used to the zoom capabilities of my 35mm, I found the 2X optical somewhat lacking. I used it more for framing the shot than zooming. There were some instances where a better zoom would have been nice. I had experiemented enough to stay from the digital zoom, because I am not that steady. I also noticed that there is no way to control the exposure; it's automatic. Again, being used to the EOS, I did have a few blurry shots where the lens stayed opened longer that I wanted. I also should have bought a \"pouch\" or something to carry my camera and accessories in. The wrist strap fit nicely and the camera is easily used with only one hand, but having it around my neck would have been more comfortable to me...yes, the EOS thing again.Overall: Probably my biggest complaint is the zoom capabilities and lack of control over exposure. Again, there is turning the flash off each time I turned on the camera. I finally worked out the system, \"flash\" \"flash\" \"select\" to turn it off when unable to easily see the display.Would I recommend this to first-timers? Yes, it's a good camera for the money and the 2mp is plenty...I don't remember the last time I printed a pic larger than 8X10...do you? I used the highest quality setting all the time and turned the viewfinder off to save battery consumption.I may still go back to the EOS on the next trip I take...maybe not. I think I will look for the Olympus 2100 because of its zoom and stabilizer capabilities. (I didn't buy it earlier because I hesitated to spend [the money] to begin digital photography.) Buy this as your first digital camera and experiment with it a lot. It is actually a good camera and will help you make the transition into digital photography. As I said, for the next excursion, I will either take the EOS or get the Olympus. Digital has the advantage of not having to change the film cartridge every 24 shots and then not having to wait for the local \"one-hour\" developer to see what you have taken. That is something I really like.I hope you found this info helpful.", "Date": "August 10, 2002"}, {"Title": "Perfect 2MP camera!!! But 2MP is insufficient", "Author": "A. Criado Perez", "ReviewID": "R2TOGVRI3V48WT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in February and sold in May to buy a better one (a Kodak DX4900). Why? I'll explain.This camera has a great price value, takes very good pictures. If you don't have more money, buy this one. But be warned, 2MP is simply not enough. I don't need super-fantastic-extra quality prints but I do like getting a 6x8 or 8x10 print where you can't tell if the picture has been taken from a digital camera or from film camera.The printers most online photo companies use to print digital images print 300dpi (dots per inch). That means that to get the best picture you can have you need a picture with that resolution. If you want a 4x6 print you'll need a (300x4) x (300x6) picture. That is 1800x1200, which is the maximum resolution this camera offers. That's right; you need at least 2MP to print a perfect 4x6 print. If you don't believe me, ask the company where you'll get you're prints from, what's the resolution of their printers. Yes, with 2MP you get good 6x8 prints and not to bad 8x10. But to get a 8x10 picture where you can't tell if it's a film picture or a digital one you need at least 3MP or more.If you don't mind about the resolution, the camera is perfect. I loved it.

The controls were so easy I didn't have to read the instructions to figure out how to work it and when I was done taking pictures...I didn't even have to load software because Macs come with IPhoto and all you do is plug in the usb conection and push the little button on the dock (i'll get into the dock in a minute) and wham...there are your photos.  Unbelievably simple....unlike other experiences I have had with digitals where the instructions might as well be written in another language...The video that comes with the camera is great when you don't want to bring a camcorder and your camera.

I've shot  3 minutes worth of stuff that nobody else got. Run out and buy this camera, there are lots of deals and you won't be disappointed.Here are my recommendations if you do buy this camera:1.  all digital cameras don't do well on regular batteries so do yourself a favor and buy the dock which comes with rechargable batteries.  Also it keeps the batteries charged constantly which is nice.  The dock also has a single button to push to transfer  all your pictures which is nice also.  I have no idea why they don't just package the two together since you really do need to have the dock.  2.  As with all digital cameras, buy extra memory the day you buy it.  8 is just not enough for anything and I don't know why all the camera companies continue to even sell cameras with just 8.

It's basically a point and shoot camera that makes digital photography (and videography!!!) accessible even to non-techies.FEATURES:Digital Camera:  At it's highest resolution of 1800X1200 it can hold about 25 pictures or so.  The easy to review LCD screen gives you instant feedback on your pictures and helps you decide on the spot whether or not they are worth keeping.  You can add on another memory card to give you even more flexibility with the number of shots you can take.Digital Video:  This is actually what sets this product apart from others in the market.  The digital video features allows you to actually record up to several minutes of video.  The video is automatically saved to MPEG format for easy playback on your PC.Easily Works With Your PC:The DX3600 connects easily with your PC and comes with transfer software so you can easily download, edit and e-mail your pictures and videos, this allowing you to share your pictures easier with family and friends.THE VERDICT:Overall, if you need a nice, easy to use camera to record your everday (and not so everyday) moments, the DX3600 is a nice camera to start with.  If you need somewhat they gives real close attention to detail (like if you're taking pictures of documents with fine print) this isn't for you.

I have used them in the past and am fairly familiar with the technology.First, here are the requirements that I had when I went shopping/researching:- Very easy to use- Good battery life- 2.1 megapixel- Battery charger- Ease of downloading- Universal Serial Bus (USB)This camera met all the requirements. At 2.2 Megapixels, the pictures are really good. 1200 x 1600 at max and 600 x 800 at min. I have had the camera for almost four weeks now. I guess I have taken around 500 pictures so far. I have tried all the settings.At high resolution, I took Christmas pictures. I printed the pictures on a Cannon S600 printer at 4 x 6 size. The printed pictures were extremely good. We sent them out with the Christmas cards this year.I bought the camera dock at the same time. This is an extremely useful add on. To download the pictures (and recharge the batteries) all you do is turn on your computer, dock the camera and press the download button on the dock. The software loads and asks where you want to put the pictures on the harddrive. Very easy.I bought a 64 meg Compact Flash. At high resolution, I can get 96 pictures. At low resolution I can get 406 pictures.Also, the camera has the ability to take digital video. 300 x 200 and something a bit lower. An interesting feature, but of limited use.

I had done fair amount of research and determined that this unit was the best bang for the buck in the 2 megapixel digital camera price range.  I even added the docking station which is a nice convenience to recharge the batteries and transfer images with no hassle.Another selling point for me was the video mode, which works very well (no, this is not camcorder quality) for quick clips of my son that I can save or email.  It would be nice to have an option to at least use the 2X optical zoom (why not?) to bring the action a little closer, but it is what it is.However, it did not take long to realize that there was a problem.  The battery life would ususally only last for 10-20 shots, than just die without warning.  I tried leaving it on the charger longer, but the same thing kept happening--sometimes even worse!  I figured that unit must be defective, so I took it back for a replacement.  The new unit worked only marginally better for the first day, but then started acting just like the other one.  Major inconvenience!I would expect to be able to shoot AT LEAST 60+ shots with the LCD screen in use before the batteries flopped, but no such luck.  I have even been careful to shut it off when I was not about to use it again immediately.  Often times it would just not turn on again!  I have read reviews from many others who have had similar problems, but I am not willing to deal with Kodak to try fixing it.  It is truely a shame, because it is so very simple to operate and the picture quality is excellent.  Be that as it may, I am dumping this unit and buying a Canon PowerShot S330 ELPH camera.  They are a bit more expensive, but seem to offer more for the money (including a 3X optical zoom rather than a 2X) and do not seem to have such reliability problems.  Also, the Kodak is definately not pocket sized as is the Canon.  I wish I could recomment the DX3600, but it just dissapoints.", "Date": "July 29, 2002"}, {"Title": "Perfect for 1st-Time Buyers.

The instructions were simple and in plain language -- with lots of pictures to point out where everything goes and can be found.It took about 10 minutes to figure everything out (where the battery & memory card goes, etc.), and after that I felt tremendously comfortable using it.This camera went to Spain with me 2 days after I bought it; it took fabulous photos and gave me no problems at all.On a 48mb memory card I managed to get 217 photos in normal mode. The 8mb internal memory that comes with the camera held 37 normal-quality photos that looked great.Favorite qualities: Optional no-flash, the ability to instantly look at your photo and decide whether to keep it or not, and the ability to review your photos virtually at will.

The files are JPEGs and not KDC format, so most computers easily recognize the files in the cards and transfer them using Windows Explorer for quick copy and paste or drag and drop functions. The Kodak transfer software is easy to use and the email feature that automatically allows the sender to select one of three file sizes to keep transfer time to a minimum.  It produces decent video segments, which depend on the speed of the compact flash to store more than a couple of minutes of video.  The quality of the images from this 2 megapixel camera is very good.  I carry it in my jacket pocket and it gets banged around and still produces great images.

The ability to zoom in or out just that little bit makes getting the right photo that much easier.  Digital zoom is a worthless gimmick that will degrade your picture quality a great deal, if you plan on using zoom go for the optical.This camera also has a macro setting, which allows very close pictures of plants and insects to turn out suprisingly well.The movie setting is another bonus, that allows you to take small movies complete with sound.  The movie quality is not great and it only works when well lit, but I have had a lot of fun with it.  It is just about perfect for posting short clips on the web.The ease of use is fairly good.  The picture quality is very good.The bad points:The display screen washes out in strong sunlight.  To be fair this is comon to most cameras.It is a little bulky by modern standards.

This camera was pretty much the only one at the time that met all those guidelines.  Other cameras matched pretty evenly as far as megapixels, zoom, and battery life went, but what sold me on the Kodak was the fact that it was practically the only camera that ALSO had video that was only limited by the size of the memory card you had in it AND the fact that it had sound on top of that.  The only thing about the video is that if you want to take video in doors you really need a lot of light.  It will come out kinda dark otherwise.

Even then, it will often turn itself off when trying to take the picture.  I have 3 small kids, and I have missed so many shots because of this.3. LONG PAUSE BEFORE SNAPPING PICTUREI know this is not a defect, but is probably by design (probably the auto-focus working), but there is a half second pause between the time you push the button and the picture actually takes.  We have missed many shots because of that as well.I hate to say it, but I will not buy a Kodak camera again.

I'm lucky to get 8 pictures before the batteries go dead (I use rechargeable batteries with the Easy Share dock, and AA Alkalines).[...] Kodak is aware of the problem. Here is their response to my query about poor battery life...'Because batteries are chemical products involving internal chemical reactions, their performance may deteriorate with prolonged storage.NiMH rechargeable batteries, if not used for a while, may need to be reconditioned as you would when using them for the first time.Otherwise, deactivation of the internal reactants may cause decreased capacity, which causes premature termination of charging.  In other words, the batteries will not charge completely, even though the dock indicates they have.If this happens, we have a couple of recommendations.  First, make sure you have the latest firmware. If you don't, consider updating your camera to the latest version.  You can locate the update by going to:[...]Once there, choose your camera from the list.  The next page will offer all the available software for your model, including any current firmware updates,  if available.  The firmware download will have a \"Read-me\" file that contains the directions for performing the update.Once you have successfully completed the update, we recommendconditioning your battery the way you would if it were being used for the first time, as we mentioned above.  It is important that you be sure you always have a fully charged battery.  To do so, place the camera on the KODAK EASYSHARE Camera Dock.  When the charge light turns green (all three green lights are lit for a Dock II), then remove the camera from the dock FOR A MINIMUM OF 5 MINUTES, and place it back on the dock.  The 5 minutes the camera is off the dock are the key to correct rechargingfor a new or uncharged battery.  Repeat this same process until the combined charging time, while the light is red on the dock, EQUALS A MINIMUM OF 2 HOURS.Once you have completed this charging process, we recommend that you leave the camera on its dock and intermittently check it for power (remove from the dock for a while then replace it).  If you use yourcamera frequently, of course, you will always have a charged battery because you will be removing and replacing it.  If you do not use your camera frequently, periodically remove the camera from the dock and take a few test shots. Doing this assures a properly maintained battery sothat you will have lots of power.Do not make the mistake of trying to charge the KODAK PHOTOLIFE Lithium Battery, CRV3, that comes with the camera.  It is not rechargeable, and an attempt to do so could result in leakage.  Also, please be aware that the camera will only charge the KODAK KAA2HR NiMh Battery.  Non-Kodakbatteries or individual AA rechargeable batteries (including Kodak batteries) are not compatible with this charger.  If you need a separate charger, they are available at the Kodak online store.Remember, your camera's dock is only charging when it displays the red light.  If the light is green, that means it is either done charging or has detected another type of battery it cannot charge.PLEASE NOTE!  Your camera's batteries lose power during image reviews and when adjusting camera settings.  Use of the LCD screen is also a big drain.......................'  If I had known about the battery problem I never would have bought this camera. Did you read the section above when Kodak states \"the batteries will not charge completely, even though the dock indicates they have.\" We can send robots to Mars but we can't make a battery charger that knows when a battery is really charged? What the hell good is a battery charger that doesn't know if a battery is charged or not? So just because the little green light says charged you can't believe it. I tried the firmware upgrade and that was futile, no help at all, just a waste of time.As is, I now carry at least 8 AA Alkalines (they last about 10 pictures if you keep the LCD turned off) whenever I use this camera away from home because you never know when it will just shut down by itself from weak batteries.  In defense to the camera I will say that it takes good pictures in daylight (night pictures with flash are worthless), I like the fact you can add other lenses and the built in video recorder is ok. The included software is nice. It includes options to adjust tint, brightness, crop etc.... The photo album is easy to use and makes saving the pictures easy. Also the removable compactflash card is a nice feature.  So if you decide to get this camera be prepared to buy lots of AA batteries. Personally I will never buy another Kodak product. I don't think it's right to sell a product with an apparent design flaw and then offer the consumer a, in my opinion, worthless remedy.

I have never had a problem with picture quality.  My wife is an artist and she has done sketches by looking the digital version of the picture.

Once you're used it, the pre-press process only takes a couple of minutes per picture.)  For the price I paid, I'm satisfied with the image quality.  I do notice that I end up white balancing many of my indoor shots.The ease of use makes up for this in my mind.  I'll take a 100 to 200 pictures in a weekend and color correct 10-20.  The zoom is weak, but the 'shutter' speed is decent and I've even gotten some decent motion shots.  One of the things I love about this camera is the number of shots I can fit on a 64 bit memory card...The video feature is also very cool.  It was an unexpected bonus with the camera.  With a large memory card I can take several minutes of video before having to dock the camera. The video is not the greatest quality - but its nice to have a video camera that fits in your pocket.If you're a serious photographer who wants to print every shot this is probably not your best bet, but if you're looking for a versatile digital camera for a reasonable price - I'd recommend the DX3600.", "Date": "October 15, 2002"}, {"Title": "It's easy", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1QID5SFVFPWP0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This cmeera is almost as easy to use as a 35mm. yet it is digital.

Now I am looking for a camera that takes pictures in as high a resolution as regular film cameras.", "Date": "September 25, 2002"}, {"Title": "DX3600 Easy to use", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2EQR5XRNEMRED", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Out of the box, 10 minutes to load the battery and software, and I was taking pictures. I wanted a point and shoot that was easy. Kodac did just that, perhaps making everything to easy.Good Points: extreme easy, apparent quality is good, auto adjust for low light or high daylight. Pictures look good, but yet to try it on the printer. No problem with WIN XP. User settings are saved, no need to re-set after turn on-off. Bad points: Could not integrate my email program address book.  Had to type the address manually. Note- this was direct from the Kodac program. Perhaps I have some learning to do, but this did prove to be cumbersome. Recommendation:  As point and shoot, so far so good. Will see quality when I print out on my photo quality printer.  Suspect from what I have seen, these will be OK.  Easy - yes.  Menus - easy. Instruction book - straight forward. Camera is so far everything they advertised. 2.2 MPx appears good to take the family pics.  Video mode works good, be careful, it picks up everything (sound).", "Date": "April 9, 2002"}, {"Title": "Best camera I ever had", "Author": "Donald Ricker", "ReviewID": "R7YHEGQIVUVVG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camrea is easy to use and takes great pictures. the software that comes with the camera is great too.

Prints are crisp and color excellent quality.  It's light weight, simple to use (afer studying the manual for about one hour), displays the shot immediately in the LCD window, so one can retake, if necessary.  I found the internal memory got used up far too quickly so upgraded to a memory card, which works beautifully.  The software is easy to use and enables one to crop, adjust color, etc., effortlessly.  Uploading, e-mailing and printing are no-brainers.
