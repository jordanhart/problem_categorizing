{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Completely failed on very first day", "Author": "Dave Pacheco", "ReviewID": "R1PPYEBW35GY1Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera while on vacation to take on a kayak trip and to the beach.  It worked fine for a few hours on the kayak trip, and I'm reasonably pleased with the hundred or so photos I got out of it.  But that afternoon at the beach, it stopped working in a pretty nasty way: when I turned the camera on, it would immediately take a photo, without having pressed the shutter release button at all.  Then when I did press the button, it wouldn't take a photo.  It seems that the shutter release button had shorted out.  I tried rinsing in fresh water, letting it dry out overnight, etc., but it never recovered.As far as I can tell, I followed all of the instructions around keeping the camera waterproof.  There was never any water in the battery compartment or anything.  It never got more than a few inches beneath the water's surface, nor did I drop it in the sand.  So I don't know what happened, but it totally failed after just a few hours of what I would consider normal use for this camera.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fun but Complicated", "Author": "Hiker66377", "ReviewID": "RZK4WTQGC1R8P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off let me say I'm very pleased with the FinePix XP50.CONS:- It's a water proof camera but it warns you not to use it around sand and water. So while it is water and mudd proof, it's NOT very sand proof.- It uses a NP45A battery and I normally like AA rechargeable cameras- It doesn't come with a car charger adapter (AC only)- You  have have to go into the settings menu a lot- The camera has a lot of features that are tricky to figue out ( you'll probably want to read the manual to get the most out of the camera)- Videos record as MOV- it doesn't float ( but not many do)PROS:- 14 mp picture are awesome. Point and shoot and crop later.- Takes great under water pictures/movies- 2.7 LCD is super bright so you can see your picture outdoors, in bright sun light, after you take them. People that use my camera comment on how nice you can see the screen outdoors- Easy to put in silent mode- Water and shock proof- Ton of mode settings so you can adjust lighting and speed automatically- 360 auto pamaramic feature. Press button and just slowly turn in a circle. It auto joins them into 1 picture that shows like a movie on the camera VER COOL for things that are to big to capture with a picture- You can use their software to upload directly to Youtude and Facebook (after you copy the pictures)You need a fast SD card,  Class 4 (44x) or faster for fast picture taking and recording HD videos. Battery only takes about 250 pictures or so. I took it on a day trip, took a few short videos, 190 pictures and reviewed the pictures a lot and it lasted all day. You can get a NP45A car chager with a battery for about $10-15. I also have a float wrist strap for it ($10).So all and all I really like the camera. I take a lot of outdoor pics so the ultra bright LCD is a big plus! 14mp let's you crop wide photos and still have great image quality. The menu is frustrating some times but you get used to using it.I recommend it for the outdoor pictures taker even if you don't plan to use it under water. Not having to worry about getting it wet or dropping it is nice!", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lives up to promises, perfect if this isn't your \"primary\" camera...", "Author": "Red",

performance. It really is a matter of making the right comparison of apples to apples. So I'll compare this to other waterproof camera methods, and other waterproof cameras in this price range. I've also uploaded a bunch of photos taken at max resolution and a video recorded at full HD 1920p 30fps. The video was taken on a foggy and overcast day. The actual quality of photos and video won't show up correctly on Amazon but it should give you at least an idea of what to expect.From a hobbyist's perspective:I had my reservations about this camera but purchased it anyway because I like the design and orange color. Most waterproof point and shoot cameras currently on the market are a little on the bulky side, expensive, and have major problems with leakage (faulty latches over battery/sd card doors). This being an upgraded model comes with a safety lock that keeps you from accidentally opening the latch and letting water in...a nice plus. It is very difficult to unlatch the XP50 door accidentally since both \"locks\" have to be unlocked or relocked -in the proper sequence- to open/close the door. I wonder if some of the reviewers may have confused this camera with its near identical predecessor which had only one, non-locking latch.When researching for a waterproof camera solution, I have tried the following:1. Pouches ie. Dicapacs - Vinyl pouches that zip closed basically like putting your camera in a super-Ziploc bag. These for the most part work well and have never failed on me. They are relatively inexpensive and universally sized. However, controls are often difficult to operate or access, they make your equipment extra bulky and difficult to hold, zoom lenses aren't always compatible, and unless you purchase a really good quality version you may end up with fuzzy pictures because of the not so crystal clear (or scratched) pouch. You also have to be very careful to keep the insides immaculately clean and dry, even the smallest amount of moisture will cause the pouch and your camera lens to fog.2. Custom underwater cases made specifically for certain camera models (ie. compact Canon cameras) - Work extremely well, allows complete access to controls and functionality of camera features, enhances underwater photography. More often than not these cases are well made with latches all around and heavier duty rubber seals. They look really cool too. Unfortunately they are very expensive, model specific, and add weight to your gear. If you have an older model, favorite camera of yours, you may be able to find a custom case for it for $20. I just saw one for a Canon Elph 3MP camera (that's old!) for $20 on Ebay. If you can't find a used one expect to pay upwards of $150-$200.3. Various dedicated underwater point and shoot cameras..both disposable and non-disposable. There is a large price range for them so it's really a matter of balancing features, purpose, and what you're willing to spend. There are many pros and cons but too many to list for each model I've tried. So below is what I think of the Fuji XP50.Design:Personally I think it looks quite attractive. I purchased the orange because it gives it a rugged, outdoorsy, look. Chrome accents all around and rubber surround the screen and anyplace your hands might need a little extra grip. There's a nice extra wide shutter button, toggle zoom, and the usual menu/record buttons on back. If you have used point and shoot digital cameras before, then you will find that buttons and menu are pretty self-explanatory. No instruction manual needed. There is only one door, with two locks on it covering the battery, sd card, and hdmi/usb. Perhaps my only concern would be the durability of the rubber seal inside this door. If I had to describe it, it sort of looks like a thin small rubber band and it's the only thing keeping the water out of your camera. As with all \"waterproof\" camera solutions, I ALWAYS test before I put to actual use. In the sink, in the bathtub, at the pool, in the rain, whatever you need to do to make sure there are no surprises later. I kid you not, I've actually tested cameras in jacuzzis just to see how well seals would hold up. (Not that I am advocating this to people who buy from stores with strict return policies.) I also rinse off the camera EVERY time it's been in or near chlorine, saltwater, etc.Performance:There is a slight lag from pressing the shutter button to taking a photo. Indoor pictures were mediocre.... Photos were consistently grainy, dark, and blurred. The flash helps a lot for subjects that are close, but not for subjects on the other side of the room (very dark). I could see that this would be an automatic deal breaker for some people.However, this camera really is marketed for outdoor use. There is no mention of it's ability to take photos indoors or in low light on the carton. Not that it couldn't, but it just wasn't designed with that in mind. (Most cameras boast about their sensitivity to low light). As an outdoors camera, it works pretty darn well. Color reproduction was very good and photos (even viewed on a 20\" screen) were very acceptable.I'm also very happy with the optical zoom (5X) and the digital zoom. Though pictures come out slightly grainy as expected, I can take photos of houses over a half mile away. Many cameras, even higher end ones, take blurry, unidentifiable photos on digital zoom.The built in photo enhancement settings (ie. scenes, macro, 360 deg panoramic, underwater, landscape, etc.) also seemed to do a pretty good job of helping me achieve the look that I wanted in my photos. There are also settings for movie trimming/joining, red eye removal, in camera cropping and rotate, and marking for upload to facebook and youtube. I've also found that continuous focus modes (both movie and still) as well as facial recognition bonuses to have. I've taken self portraits of myself at arms length and pictures came out very sharp and my face, though off center, is very much in focus.Movies came out extremely nice at Full HD 30FPS 1920p and we have viewed these on a 20\" monitor in HD quality. It was impressive coming from a $100+ camera. The microphone is located on the front of the camera and speaker on the side. Speaker is pretty good and you can hear a voice clearly on it. The mic will pick up sounds clearly if you are in front of it, but speaking from behind the camera results in a muffled recording. Though I'm not happy about the usb cable they provided (wish they would have included a micro hdmi) since I rarely hook up cameras to pc's.Summary:Overall a good buy for the $100 dollar range. I paid about $140 and also received an 8gb sd card, a floating wrist strap, a neoprene arm strap, a regular wrist strap, a camera case with neck strap...a certificate for a free custom photo book, I'd say I got a great deal.It is not the best waterproof point and shoot but it's definitely not the worst. It has so far been a solid performer and durable for me, but it's hard to say if there are just a lot of lemons out there or only people who have lemons post reviews because many have stated theirs crapped out on them the first day. So far my camera is living up to what was promised. For the record Nikon makes a similarly priced waterproof camera that is humongous and has horrible reviews. Just goes to show how little effort is put into this niche market.There are definitely models out there that combine a good indoor and outdoor camera in one but you will spend 2 to 3 times more. What I enjoy most is that this relatively low cost camera is just used for my outdoor activities and as such, I can \"manhandle\" it a little more than I would my $1000 DSLR...heck I wouldn't even manhandle a $200-$300 Canon point and shoot...but I'm less worried about my equipment and having more fun on the jetski with the Fuji XP50. I also want to mention that this is not my primary camera. I use this for anything I can't (rather, shouldn't) do with my DSLR.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Took it back", "Author": "RNS", "ReviewID": "R1620AKWGJL51L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was not very happy with this camera.  Our last point-and-shoot died, and we needed another \"pocket\" camera.  Without doing much market research, I went to the local big box store to look at what they had in stock.  They had 3 waterproof/shockproof cameras, and I picked the FujiFilm Finepix XP50.  The first day we used it - no real \"problems\" other than blurry pictures and an apparent slow write-time to clear the buffer to take a second picture.  The second day we used it, I put it in my bathing suit pocket & waded around with it for a bit (no more than 2 1/2 feet under water at any time).  A couple of shots came out fine, but then I started seeing white on the rear screen & in the images.  A quick check showed water inside the lens housing.  I quickly took it to the bank & dried off & opened it to find water in the battery/memory card compartment as well...  Camera was less than a week old, no dirt/hair/apparent problems with seal, but there was a leak somewhere.

I had orginally purchased the Lumix by Panasonic with was about $100 more expensive but bugged out after just 5 days.  So, I picked this up as a quick buy on vacation to replace the Lumix.  I was happy with the photos for the most part.  This camera is much more sensitive to what shooting mode you have it in with regards to the quality of photos that you end up with. For example, Zoomed in photos can turn out blurry with slight movements if you don't have it set on sports mode.  I have not tested out the underwater or shock proof claims yet and probably won't given the feedback I've seen on this and other models claiming to be water proof.  It is water resistant for sure, can get splashed etc which is good enough for me.  I plan on taking it on scouts outings etc and it being rugged is helpful.

Carter", "ReviewID": "R7LOAB5YWQKX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A few days before we left for Hawaii, we decided to buy an underwater digital camera instead of using disposables.  We payed about $150--we didn't have enough time to order one, so had to find something that was in stock somewhere nearby.  Honestly, after a week on Kauai and 3 snorkling adventures, my husband and I both feel like we got our money's worth.  The pictures from our first two snorkling trips aren't great quality, but that was due to poor underwater visibilty, not the camera.  It can be hard to aim well for your shot, but again, that isn't really the fault of the camera.  The surf was moving us AND the fish around, we're wearing diving masks which are fogging up on us, etc.  We STILL got a lot of really neat shots, and some video footage as well.  If you're in the ocean (or other moving water) expect some shaking.  If you're using it underwater, make sure you change to that setting.Yes, if you read the whole owner's manual, it sounds pretty silly, telling you it's waterproof in one place, and not to get it wet somewhere else!  If you're out of the water, waterdrops on the lens (rain, waterfall mist) will show up as a blur on your shot, so keep that in mind.  Decent battery life so far.  My husband shot a FANTASTIC panorama of the Waimea Canyon using this camera, and with the frequent rain on Kauai, it was nice to be able to keep my more expensive camera safe without missing photo opportunities.After each snorkling trip we first rinsed the camera, then let it sit in fresh water for several minutes.  Even though I never spotted sand on the camera, there would be some in the sink after soaking.  We then let the camera dry completely before opening it up to download pictures or charge the battery.  I would find a few tiny water drops when I opened it up, but these were always just *outside* the seal.  I would dry these up immediately and make sure there was no moisture in the area before closing the camera back up.I left Kauaii with pictures and video of me swimming with sea turtles . . . I have no complaints!", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!!", "Author": "Tyler Oliva", "ReviewID": "R2IYK2HWCI4Q3R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera! I brought it with me while I went to Bermuda. It's pictures aren't as sharp or amazing as some other compact cameras, but this definitely did the job well. I took about 700 pictures throughout the seven day trip, and a good chunk of them were underwater pictures. I never had any problems about water damage during the trip, and when you set the camera to underwater mode its shots are excellent! If you see some water inside the little latch that conceals the battery/SD card, don't be scared. The water leaks in, but stops at the rubber strip so it will not enter in. It freaked me out the first time I saw it, but it's not a problem.As I said before, this camera takes excellent photos, and has a decent zoom for a fixed lens. The colors are vibrant, and the shutter speed is quick, so you're not losing your subject before the picture is taken. The underwater pictures are great. That is, if you put the camera on the underwater mode. They look very nice, and the colors of all the coral really pop and sometimes you get one shot that shows just about every detail of your subject. But it does not float, so I would get a loop that will allow it to float, just in case you drop it by accident underwater. On the other had, the video isn't so amazing. Well, I suppose the video is okay but the audio is horrible! The wind is so loud that most of the time voices can't or are barely heard, and if you talk too loud then it'll be that irritating scratchy sound.The battery is intermediate, and if you're an extreme power saver like me and turn it off right after you've taken your picture, it lasts a good amount of time. The interface is very easy to use and the camera has many features. And while going through the tunnels in Fort St. Catherine, the flash blinded some people, and lit up the whole tunnel for a good picture. The flash is very bright, probably better than may Nikon Coolpix S6000.Overall, I would recommend this camera to anybody, and it can definitely take a beating. It never broke down on me (like some reviews say) and it did everything I put it through.

I shot many pics and videos and have to say that most of them came out very well. I really do like the digital video feature. I zoomed in and out while underwater and have a couple of videos that are up to 2 minutes in length. Two other people on our trip also had the same XP50 and one had an XP30. By the end of the trip all of our cameras began to show condensation under the back monitor screen; the XP30 was in the poorest shape - it also had condensation around the lens. My thought is that its door locking system isn't quite as tight as the XP50. I would also be willing to believe you cannot go even near the 16' limit recommended by the makers. WHen snorkelling, it is a little tough to make out good detail on the monitor. After each trip, I washed it with soap and water to get the salt and sunscreen off of it and it shined and looked like new each time. Another friend used an Olympus and he reported no problems above or below the water. His Olympus was in the $300 range. Also, with the price of the XP50 and the amount of pics and vids I took, with a discount, its not bad but you know it will not last very long. Now I have digitals that I can manipulate any way I choose, rather than hard copies and negatives.

But having to go through several steps to change even the simplest setting was something I decided I did not want to do.  I missed having more outside knobs and dials to use, which, of course, a waterproof camera wants to have fewer of; I thus decided I did not need a waterproof camera.I also thought the lens was in a rather awkward place in the top left corner.  I found myself having to move my left hand down, and thus found the camera somewhat uncomfortable to use.The editing software installed on the camera seemed good.  The flash, however, used in my medium sized living room in the evening, was too bright.  Taking pictures in that same room without a flash worked great, though, so no real need for the flash when the room was well lit by my lamps.Something else that bothered me was the lack of catching movement and \"freezing\" it - my two older cameras can do that without any problems - this one could not.  Perhaps there was a setting I did not find that could have corrected this?  I tried to find out, but could not in the time I familiarized myself with this camera.However, for somebody who wants a waterproof camera, it will be a great pick; the pictures and video's were great, but I returned it anyway.

If you go to the Fujifilm you can download \"the manual they should have supplied in the box\", which is a BIG improvement over the one provided on purchase. Found at: [...] (Might be a good idea for potential buyers to review prior to purchase).After charging up the battery for the first time, I loaded it into the camera and sealed it up. Upon turning it on, it came up with the set-up screen. About a moment later, the screen switched to an alert indicating the battery compartment was not fully sealed. Looking at the two latches they appeared properly secured and I also gave both of them an extra press to make sure. The alert stayed on screen, so I started pressing buttons, until when I finally pressed the shutter button the alert went away and the camera switched to photo taking mode (I went back in later to update the time/date). Later, I figured out that it regularly shows this alert to help the user avoid a disaster.A note of caution: When setting the camera down, it is instinctive to not place it on its back, which could cause the view screen to get scratched, or on the front which places the lens in harms way, but trying to set it down in it's \"natural\" upright position is EXTREMELY UNSTABLE. There are four little legs/tabs (about 1/16\" high) that prevent the camera from sitting in a stable position  If you're setting it down, your only practical options are on the back or the front. A pocket or camera bag would be preferred.Question: Does the battery charge while hooked to a computer? Nothing, that I could find, in the instructions indicate that it does.On the topic of batteries, the newer style lithium-ion batteries are excellent performers BUT they tend to have very limited compatibility. If you're on vacation, miles from any large store and your battery goes dead can you easily find a replacement? For example, my Sony camera uses the same style/size BUT not compatible battery. I really prefer the good ol' AA battery that might, in a pinch, be swapped out with some other electronic that may be at hand. And more importantly that can be found easily in just about any small shop or gas station, AND in just about any country.An interesting note found in the downloaded (not in the supplied manual) - \"To ensure continued water resistance, it is recommended that you have the water-resistant seal replaced about once a year (a fee is charged for this service). Contact your retailer or a FUJIFILM-authorized repair technician for more information.\" I can't help but wonder how much that will cost? I could not find any further information on this topic at the Fujifilm website.The camera has a very solid feel to it, the controls are well placed, and the unit will easily fit in a shirt pocket. The functions, for the most part, are reasonably intuitive but the different modes take a while to dig through (via the menu button).At this point I've used the camera on two different days. Both times, while hiking, on very sunny bright days. Using the camera in the SR (Scene Recognition) auto mode the camera easily recognized when I needed a close-up macro shot and when I was shooting a landscape. The auto focus works pretty reliably and most shots turned out quite sharp. As for exposures, by far, most of the exposures are under exposed with a very dark cast to them and shadowed areas are extremely dark. I still have to \"play\" with the unit to make a fairer judgment but this will give others an idea what to expect. I have yet to test the units water proof capabilities (kinda scary).", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "XP does take fine pix's see my wave vid/pix", "Author": "cutie", "ReviewID":

If not waterproof in a pool, then it would be useless to me. I already have several non-waterproof cameras.So this camera failed me because it is not waterproof. I have a masters in engineering, so I know how to close a slide latch, followed by another slide latch, in the proper order, which was clearly labeled on the camera. This was not an instance of user error. Based on other reviews, it was likely not just a single bad copy of the camera. Many users have reported problems with water entering the camera. The water first appeared as condensation on the back screen, then later, condensation on the lens, which renders all photos worthless at that point.The camera is allegedly waterproof to 1/2 atmosphere (15 ft), but the camera never went to even half of that depth, and it's total time spent at anything under two feet from the surface was three seconds, at a maximum depth of seven feet. The problem might be, and I'm speculating, that normal use in a pool, with the camera attached to a wrist, creates forces greater than 1/2 atmosphere, such as stroking the water to move forward, etc. Pehaps the specs are simply not sufficient to withstand normal activity at the water's surface.

First, there are no manual controls so I can't set it for maximum aperture and have the camera set maximum shutter speed for conditions as I can with the old Canon.  The \"sport\" mode is absolutely useless for preventing blurring when I'm in motion. The \"sport\" mode does not calculate for maximum aperture or shutter speed and implying that this mode is useful for high speed action shooting is a cruel hoax.  Even when holding the camera perfectly still, the quality of the photographs are unacceptably poor and very noticeably inferior to my old Canon, very noticeably inferior.  This camera is a good example high pixel count being absolutely meaningless and just a sales gimmick.If you simply want low quality snapshots, I suggest you use your cell phone.  If you want shallow underwater shots and will accept poor quality images, this camera might work for you.  My very first camera was a Fuji back around 1999 and I've had other Fuji cameras I've been very happy with, but this is the worst camera Fuji has ever made with regard to picture quality -- even worse than my first 1.5 MP camera. I don't give up easily so I thought I could figure ways around some of this camera's failings.  Over the months I've tried every trick in the book, but I've run out of tricks.  I foolishly kept the camera too long to return it and now I'll have to find somebody to give it to as a gift - I sure wouldn't feel right charging money for this turkey.  By the way, yes, I took a chance and did \"upgrade\" the firmware (because I was so desperate to improve the images), but it didn't help the horrible picture quality one bit.  Fuji does kindly warn you that if you upgrade the firmware, it is tricky and it might not work and if it doesn't you will end up with a useless camera that is not covered by warranty.

I took pictures in the pool, the beach and snorkeling. Picture quality was extremely good. The OUT of water shots were as good as any other digital point and shoot I've used. I had NO issues with the flash as other reviewers indicated. In fact, the flash seemed very even and not concentrated in one spot which is always one of my biggest gripes with point and shoots. This would serve someone very well as a day-to-day point and shoot camera. The underwater shots were also VERY good; they were clear with good color and contrast.I charged the battery at the end of every day and never really had any problems with battery life. On a couple of occasions I couldn't get it to shoot video due to a low battery, but it always shot pictures.

My youngest daughter loved using it it the pool with friends until the battery compartment door opened on its own.  I let the camera dry and used rice to absorb moisture.  It never worked again.  The worst part is that it's not even six months old.  My older daughter lives in St. Thomas so we wanted something water proof.  Her camera has the same issue with the Battery compartment door not staying closed.  The biggest problem is That I cannot get anyone to tell me how to return them.

I figured why not, we may be able to get a few good pics from it that we wouldn't take with a non-waterproof.

The colors are  ice and if you have a good photo software program (I use Aperture) to tidy pics up a bit, you can have some pretty good results.

I gave it 2 (TWO) STARS because the shot/recovery time was in an ok range. The battery gave me no problems but I have a spare just in case.

Within an hour I took stills and movies, on auto, in shade, bright shade and full sun. I took stills both with and without the flash.Despite the optimum exposure set up, the XP50 failed to deliver more than a few properly exposed stills or frames.  Even though everything was neutral, photos had large areas of complete black or white wash out.  When the flash was used, it took the camera off automatic and delivered a completely washed out picture. Even dark colors were totally whited out by the flash.  Near white and lighter colors washed out completely even without the flash.The all inclusive automatic functions are all or nothing.  Make one manual and they all become manual.

I go snorkeling every year and always wanted one, but didn't want to mess with the underwater casings. Bought mine at Costco at a good price, tried taking a few photos. Maybe there's some inconsistencies with the sensors, because some reviewers say they got great photos. My photos were either grainy or blurry, even under good light conditions. Really, REALLY grainy.  It may be a whole lot of megapixels, but what good is it when the sensor is recording giant blotches of color instead of any detail? I was about 15 feet away from the subject, and you can't even actually make out any features on the face, just blobs. And when the sun hits the camera, the hard cover on the lens creates a lot of lens flare that obliterates half of your photo. Thankfully Costco has a great return policy; it's going back.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for the beach but not perfect.", "Author": "Mike C \"Mike C\"", "ReviewID": "R1EHOMO7TSW0AS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had the original for a few years and it died one day in the water.
