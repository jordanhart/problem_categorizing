{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good quality images but needs some skill", "Author": "Tomboy Chic \"SJ\"", "ReviewID": "RWRU4HAI7CKV0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about 15 days back. I have used it a couple of times indoors, outdoors and indoors with low-light conditions.Used correctly, this camera does a great job of taking good quality images. I had to play with the camera for about 15-20 mins to get familiar with it so I could take the best pictures possible. My sister owned a Powershot A530 before this one and i had the same experience with that too.This camera fits nicely in your jeans pocket and is quite light.You will need a tripod to take good low-light shots. I have a cat and a rabbit and a 3 yr old nephew - The kids and pets setting really works well to take pictures of them. Generally the few manual settings it does have are good enough for a serious amateur photographer.One gripe I do have is that with regular AA alkaline batteries the flash recycle time can go up to 8 seconds and the camera is blank and unusable during this time. This of course is a problem with most canon Powershots. The solution I have found is to use batteries made specifically for taking pictures (Duracell makes some) or just use rechargeable NiMH batteries. This works great. Almost down to 1 sec between shots with that.Overall I'd definitely recommend this camera to anyone. But you have to be a little patient and get used to it first - I think this is true for any good camera out there though.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Cliff", "ReviewID": "R3G8KNDG6T9EZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes excellent pictures. I particularly like the Optical Image Stabalization, Motion sensor, and face recognition. I only make 4 X 6 prints. So far no problems. The pet/children mode does a good job of stopping action.I've used the optical viewfinder a couple of times. It doesn't show 100% of the picture, but it sure makes a difference in extreme sunlight.Sometimes it is necessary indoors to increase the ISO in order to increase the flash distance (easily done with a button). I still get great pictures. I know some reviewers blow the pictures up and indicate the noise in the picture. It's just not evident in normal picture prints. I'm sure there would be obvious noise if I was using high ISOs. Battery life is great also. I use Lithium AAs. They last so long there is no need to use recharageable batteries.The only thing I definately miss is a button to delete \"ALL\" pictures. There's a button for individual deleting, but you have to use the menu to detete all. I guess you could look at it as a safety feature, making it hard to accidentially delete all your pictures.There is a lack of manaul controls, but I never used the manual controls in my prior cameras.The camera size will fit into a pocket, even though I prefer using a case that fits on my belt. I would highly recommend this camera to others.", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "I love almost everything about my A1000", "Author": "Deb \"Mom of 3 Girls\"", "ReviewID": "RUCRQ94J0I4EN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera a few weeks ago to replace a previous Canon digital camera (the A540) that I absolutely loved. So far I've been very happy with this one, with one glaring exception - not specifically about the camera itself, but rather the software that comes with it.I'm an amateur photographer and find that this type of point-and-shoot works well for me - especially since it has a 4x optical zoom which gives clearer, more vivid photos.  I really like how easy the Canon cameras are to use and the range of features - and this one doesn't disappoint. I also like the 2.5\" LCD and the fact that this camera is small enough to easily fit in a pocket or purse. It's really very versatile and I love that about it.The only things that I really can complain about are that I do somewhat miss the chunky handgrip on my previous Canon, but that's not a huge deal. What IS a huge deal, for me anyway, is their 'updated' version of the Camera Window software that comes with this camera. This is the software that you run to download photos from the camera - and I can't believe how horrible this particular version is. The previous version that I used with my other Canon camera was great - it was windows-based and you could select any photos on your card then download, print or delete them as you wished. However, in this new version - it's got a black interface, no text by the icons to tell you what they do - and there is no way to delete the photos from your card. I e-mailed Canon to double-check and was told that yes, this is the case - you have to use Windows Explorer to delete your photos. Why I would want to use two different programs when before I could easily use just one is beyond me... I'm going to re-install the old version that I have and hope that it will work with this camera, because I am incredibly annoyed with the new version right now.Other than the software issue, I love this camera and think that it's a very good choice for someone who wants a camera that takes a great quality photo and is easy to use and carry around. I only hope that Canon will re-think the Camera Window decision - I'm a loyal Canon enthusiast, but am very disappointed in them right now.", "Date": "November 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "\"Best Value\" for a Point-And-Shoot Camera", "Author": "Lewis A. Edge Jr. \"Happy Traveler\"", "ReviewID": "R17K1BYOYWZ5ME", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Unfortunately not many point-and-shoot cameras have optical viewfinders anymore and that's a shame.  This camera DOES have an optical viewfinder and that helps it to stand above the crowd.  It also has an LED screen but such screens are nearly impossible to see in bright sunlight.  Holding a camera at arm's length to compose a picture on a screen can introduce shake and cause blurry photos.  Therefore, for many, using an optical viewfinder is a much better option.Since this camera has an optical viewfinder, image stabilization, face recognition and a 10 megapixel sensor an amateur photographer who is using this camera can take superior photographs in good light that will yield sharp 8 1/2 X 11 prints.  Although I usually use a digital SLR, I must say that I'm impressed with the quality of the images that this camera delivers...especially considering its low price, small size and 7-ounce weight.  With rechargeable or lithium AA cells, battery life is excellent and recycle times are short.The July 2009 issue of Consumer Reports features a cover photo of this camera and ranks it just below a $450 camera in its \"compact camera\" ratings.  On their recommendation and after doing considerable comparison shopping and reading other reviews, I bought this camera for my stepson.  However, before I gave it to him, I took many photos under varied conditions to ensure that it would be adequate for his needs.  I was so impressed that I'll probably get one for myself.The fact that I could favorably compare the photos from this camera with those from my much more expensive digital SLR was remarkable, but there are inevitable limitations.  There are no manual settings for exposure or focus.  The 4X optical zoom may not give as much range as some photographers need and the effective flash distance is limited.  The sensor has excellent dynamic range, but introduces noise in the pictures when they're taken in low light with ISO settings above 100.A couple of AA batteries are included with the camera, but you'll soon need more and better ones.  A small 32MB SD card is included but a much bigger SD card or cards will be needed if you want to store more than seven or eight full-resolution photos.  Therefore, your initial investment will need to be larger than the base price of the camera for it to perform up to expectations.  Nonetheless, when considering the price, small size and very good image quality I believe this camera will meet or exceed the expectations of all but the most demanding amateur photographers.About a year after I bought and evaluated this camera, I bought Canon's replacement for this model; the Powershot A1100IS, for my wife.  It is about the same size and price as this camera was last year but offers more pixels a bigger included memory card, more sophistication but retains the optical viewfinder.  Check out the A1100IS.  It's even better.", "Date": "June 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot A1000IS", "Author": "Crab cameraman", "ReviewID": "R29IZSX4QLRBOV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera was purchased for my wife who reluctently agreed to enter the digital age.  Wanted a point and shoot camera that was compact and fairly simple to use but she still wanted occasional creative control.  She takes many photos in bright sunlight so a optical viewfinder(not too many point and shoot digitals have them) was a must since many LCD screens are difficult to see in bright light.  So far the camera has met or exceeded her expectations.  She took a whole series of photos outdoors in bright sunlight and photos taken at the Thanksgiving Dinner table and sent to the local Walgreens for processing were very good. Took a short video with a 4GB HC card just for fun and it actually looks pretty good on playback! All in all so far the camera is performing very well.", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Love it..", "Author": "A.

This is especially helpful in low light situations. It's also nice to be able to check whether or not the auto-focus has focused properly...You can set the A1000 to \"macro\", \"normal\" and \"infinity\", but from there you have to hope that the auto-focus worked properly.I was pleasantly surprised that the aperture automatically adjusted to the changing light conditions in the movie mode. You can also lighten or darken the light reading in the movie mode, but if you do this, the aperture won't adjust to changing light conditions as you make a video.The camera is small enough to fit in a small case or pocket or pocketbook.....I've owned the camera for almost a year now...I still miss being able to manual focus as I could with the a510. I was just out trying to take a picture of a spider's web. I couldn't focus on it with the a1000. With manual focus I would have been able set the focus on around 1 foot...Then an airliner went overhead. I tried taking a picture of that on 4x zoom and the camera would focus on it. If I had manual focus, I could have set it on infinity...Also, when it come to taking movies with this camera, I think that the a510 had a better microphone than the a1000.", "Date": "October 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "New to Digital Photography-Canon served me well", "Author": "David Paredes", "ReviewID": "R1YBH2V12LWZ7G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this Canon Powershot just before leaving on a family trip and had just a few hours to familiarize myself with it before putting it to work. Given my lack of familiarity with any digital cameras, I have little with which to make a comparison, however, I found the camera easy to use and was very satisfied with the resulting pictures. I was warned by my sister that the capacity of the memory card supplied with the camera would be too small, so I immediately bought another card. If I hadn't been forewarned, I certainly would have been disappointed on my trip.  Finally, in the course of two weeks I took about 300 photographs and ran through three sets of batteries. The 2x batteries are inexpensive and easy to find, but I don't know if that rate of use is par for the course.

The main reasons I picked this camera is because of size and price and its performance which I have read about here and various camera websites. This camera is small enough for me to take with me anywhere I wish to go and its not a cumbersome burden like my old camera, since I have taken up hiking and rock climbing in the last year this is extremely important to me and so far it has been great to take along! The pictures it takes are awesome! I was really impressed with the quality of photos this thing takes when it is utilizing the digital zoom, it can really get out there and deliver quality of photos leaps and bounds over the digital zoom capabilities of my old camera!Overall its a compact camera that is simple to use and delivers amazing photos!

Hamburg", "ReviewID": "R7DOYH5H1QG3V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I mostly shoot with Canon SLRs, but we wanted a compact camera for the times when we don't want to lug a bulky camera around just to take snapshots.  I also wanted a simple camera for our kids to use.  We used to use a Canon S50 for that purpose, but it's getting long in the tooth and I felt it was time to replace it.My criteria were simple- it needed to use AA batteries and SD memory cards, because I didn't want to clutter our house with another charger or buy new cards.  We have tons of rechargeable AAs in the house, I'd use those with this rather than disposables.  And it needed to be inexpensive, but still take good photos.  I also wanted optical image stabilization and an optical view finder for bright, sunny days.  I didn't really care about the brand, but Canon has always served me well.This wasn't the least expensive camera out there, but it was the least expensive that gave me everything I was looking for.For what it is, this little camera is fantastic.  It doesn't compare to SLRs in terms of performance or image quality, but I wouldn't expect it to.  It does, deliver nice snapshots.  If you know how to pre-focus (a necessary skill with all autofocus cameras), it's quick enough.  The S50 that it replaced was a $500 camera when I bought it six years ago; I think this is faster and more fun to use.The photo quality is good; I put the camera on \"easy\" mode and snapped a few shots of my kids.  The camera used fill flash appropriately, and did a good job with exposure.  There is almost no noise in the ISO 80 photos (you'll get these in bright light if you let the camera select ISO).  ISO 400 has pretty bad noise; it looks like ISO 1600 on the Digital Rebel XT or XS, but it is entirely acceptable for snapshots that will be printed at 4x6.I didn't buy this to be a video camera, but it has pretty much replaced a six-year-old Mini-DV camcorder.  The video quality is almost as good as that one, and the camera is more convenient, so we've found ourselves getting video that we otherwise would have missed by not having the video camera with us.  Don't expect stunning video, but it sure beats the VHS video of me when I was a kid.  It's good enough to record the memories.The build of the camera seems a little flimsy, especially the battery door; I'm docking the camera a star for that.  The battery door is also difficult to open.The manual controls are pretty limited, but, to be honest, I don't feel like I need them on a camera like this.  You can manually control the ISO and flash; letting the camera pick the shutter speed and aperture based on that is fine for me.  If I want full control, I can lug my DSLR around; if I have this, I just want to record the moment.For the price, this camera is great- it does everything I expected it to do and it does it well.  Look elsewhere (and be prepared to spend more money) if you're concerned about manual controls or advanced features.  But if you just want an inexpensive camera to capture memories, you can't go wrong with this one.", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Quality", "Author": "Cart", "ReviewID":

I have had two digital cameras prior to this camera in my life. Each time I paid about $150-$200 for the camera. This one was only $130 about, and the quality blows away thet Kodak I had, and the Pentax (the last one I had).The most obvious difference between this one and others I've had is the picture and video quality, especially the video quality. When I play back a video on my computer, it looks and sounds like a professional camera. It looks like you are watching a TV program the quality is so good. I couldn't believe it. I looked at the file sizes and I knew why. I think my videos are 10 times the amount of space as my other cameras were. I bought a 4GB card to replace my 256MB card. It is worth it though. I save all my videos and pictures on a Seagate external hard drive. Love that thing.I attached a video that we took the other day with this camera.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "i'm confused?

The body of this camera seems like flimsy plastic.  Every flash picture I've taken has suffered from redeye.  Worst of all, there are two very bright hot pixel groups which have appeared within two weeks of the camera's purchase.  These are very prominent in the viewfinder, and are quite annoying.  They show up in the final images too, but are less obvious.  The only way to get rid of these is to send the camera to Canon, to have the hot pixels remapped.  There is no way for the end user to do this himself with this camera.  Also there is no RAW mode unless you run the CHDK hacker toolkit, which hasn't yet been ported to this camera.  It seems to me that 10 megapixels exceeds the capability of the lens to deliver a sharp image.  But since there is no RAW or TIFF mode support, there's no way to know for sure.  It could just be JPEG compression noise on every freaking image, which I find disappointing.On the positive side, the camera's face detection is excellent; the flesh tones are very real; the camera is very compact in size, and uses standard AA batteries. The preview LCD is large, and there is also an optical viewfinder with tracking zoom.  The automatic lens cover works great.  I'm sure there are worse cameras in this price range, but I really expected more from Canon.Bottom line: if you want something cheap, get a used Nikon coolpix.

I have found Canon products and tech support to be superior over any other maker of consumer electronic products, especially including cameras and printers. The flash recharges faster with rechargeable Ni-MH batteries and they last longer. I bought a AA/AAA charger with 4 pre-charged AA batteries for only $10 and they work great, last forever. Also like the use of SD memory cards that are fairly cheap, readily available and work directly with my printer or through the included mini USB cable that I connect to my computer. I have owned a Canon 35mm SLR camera in the past and was always very happy with it, but cannot say the same about my prior Pentax, Nikon, Kodak or Sony camera purchases, both digital and non-digital.

This camera does all the work for me and makes me look like I know what I'm doing.Most of the time I keep it set on Auto, so the camera figures out whether a flash is necessary, what the ISO setting needs to be, all that stuff, and makes it happen.  I set up the shot and press the button, and the photo comes out great.I have tried some of the other specialty settings, like Floral, for taking close-ups of flowers, and that does help to bring out the colors without over-exposing them with the flash.  I've also tried Nighttime and Aquarium settings, and those both were very helpful.  Ones I want to try but haven't only because I haven't been in the right environment yet are Fireworks and Beach. The point is, it's very user-friendly for someone who doesn't know a whole lot about what they're doing.A friend told me he thought I didn't need 10 megapixels, but I quietly disagreed with him.  I do a lot of stuff in print publishing, so I know that the resolution of photos matters.  I got 10 megapixels because I figured I wouldn't have to worry about resolution or size issues, and I was not wrong.  Every photo I've taken would work just fine in a print format.Downloading the photos is pretty easy.  Sometimes my PC forgets where the program is, even when I have the camera plugged into it, so I have to find the program instead of having it launch automatically.  Once I've got the program running, though, it pretty much manages itself.  Then it brings up a viewer that allows me to see and edit the photos one at a time, or play them in a slide show.Here are the few, minor downsides I've discovered so far.  Those specialty settings are a little buried in the menus, so the first couple of tries I couldn't remember how to get to them.  Same thing with some of the more advanced, do-it-yourself features.  I wanted to take a photo of the full moon and I knew there was a way to adjust the ISO settings manually, but I couldn't figure that out without the manual in my hand.  Since I didn't happen to have the manual with me up at the top of the mountain, I was out of luck.The biggest downside (and it's not even that big) is this camera burns through batteries like they're matchsticks.  I'll use the camera over a period of a few hours, turning the camera off when it's not in use or letting it \"sleep\" or shut itself off when it wants to.  After three or four of those types of sessions, it tells me it needs new batteries.  If I've used the flash a lot or if I've taken movies, the batteries burn up much faster.  I haven't tried using rechargeable AA's in there yet, but I think I'm going to give that a go.The battery compartment is kind of tricky to open.  You have to slide a button forward and then slide the cover off to the right.  It's hard to hold the button forward and push to the right at the same time, so I usually have to work at it a few times before I can get it open.You'll also want to purchase a case to carry & protect this, and a memory card with lots of capacity.  I got an 8 MB memory card, which in this camera can hold 2500 photos at a time.  I haven't even come close to filling it up yet.Overall, the camera was definitely worth the price.

Two drawbacks: can't shoot in raw mode, which limits your retouching options, and requires special software/drivers to read from the card - no pretending it's an external USB drive. Oh, and it's hard to delete a group of photos even WITH the software - you have to go one at a time through the camera's interface, or delete all.

Ma", "ReviewID": "R1I0MW5ILG5AFF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently bought this Canon A1000IS, and I've been toying around with it for the past several days. I was looking for a point-and-shoot camera that I could carry around and travel with and take fairly good pictures. This is the exact camera I was looking for. I bought this over the A2000/A2100 because of its smaller size, cheaper cost, and viewfinder. I bought this over the new A1100 because the main difference between the A1000 and the new A1100 is the extra 2.1 megapixels. I'm not a big fan of the brown color that I have, but it was the cheapest option. I'd personally prefer the blue or gray.Pros:AA batteries - Don't do regular alkaline. Go with NiMH rechargeable batteries, and preferably Eneloop or precharged Duracell and the like. It lasts a good while. I've taken many test shots, video, changing settings, reviewing test shots and my eneloop batteries are still going strong.Image quality - Canon-like quality. Not Digital SLR quality. Other reviews state that high ISO is grainy. Personally I've gone up to ISO 400 and 800 with my photos, and as a point-and-shoot the image quality is just fine.Optical Zoom - 4x optical which is more than the typical 3x in most point and shoots.Camera Body - Sturdy body for the most part and the LCD screen is a good size.Cons:Flash recharge - It's not that bad, but it can take up to 5-6 seconds to recharge sometimes. If you're getting a point-and-shoot though, then it's not like you need to be taking multiple quick shots.Buttons - The buttons are not backlit so it can be hard to see in the dark. I'm not sure how many cameras even have backlit buttons. You can redirect the lcd light to the buttons if you really need to see the button labels.Compartment doors - The door for the AA battery and memory compartment looks and feels flimsy. Also the door for the AV and USB compartment is an elastic door that's not that great.Glossy LCD screen - The LCD screen has some pretty bad glare, but there is a viewfinder. Most cameras usually have glossy, glarey screens anyway I think.Cannot control shutter speed - You can't manually adjust shutter speed, so you have to play around with just ISO and flash.Size - This could very well also be a pro, but the size is bigger than the other subcompact cameras. However you won't find a smaller camera that takes AA batteries to my knowledge. It fits well in my hand though, and I think I have average sized hands. It can easily fit in a front pocket unless you have tight pants and small pockets.I recommend the Canon A1000IS.

I had some issues withmy Canon $350 SD950 - but it was never picture quality - it was durability. I am pleased to saythat the A1000 gets high marks for both durability and picture quality. It has taken a lot of abuseincluding being dropped from three feet on a concrete floor, being sprayed with a hose, and being caught in a dust storm.I bought it as soon as it came out because it uses AA batteries and I never have to worry abouthaving batteries. Get decent quality AA's and the camera has battery life comparable to any consumer point-and-shoot. There was no 12MP version available when I bought this but 10MP is adequate for most purposes. (I am a little concerned with the upgraded version - the 12MP A1100 because I recently bought one from Amazon and within a few days the lens refused to open. Of course Amazon stands behind their products and the exchange for a new camera was quick and cost nothing because we were in the 30 day window - which Amazon actually extends to about 37 days because of shipping. Thank you Amazon.)I read in a few reviews about the door that you open to insert the batteries and the SD card. It didconcern me at first, but it didn't take long to get the hang of it. Be aware that batteries haveto fit snugly for the current to flow properly,especially with AA's, so there has to be some pressure on them and that explains the design of the door.I have heard that this camera has been very well-received by the public and I cannot believe that thestreet price actually went up rather than down, as is common.

My previous camera, which was my first digital camera, was a Polaroid i533.  I had it for almost two years and the reason that I decided to purchase a new one was because the lack of viewfinder on the camera caused it to use batteries at an abominably fast rate.  So I researched the best camera for indoor and low light settings, and was referred to the Canon Powershot A1000.  I have used it to photograph beach outings, sunsets, zoo animals, moving animals (running horses), landscapes, and portraits; both inside and outside, in various light sources.  I even used it to take my best friend's senior pictures.  In low light (with high ISO) I notice much less noise than with my previous camera, and the colors are phenomenal especially when the \"vivid\" color balance is employed.  The number of different modes on this camera is delightful - in addition to an automatic mode and one where all settings can be programmed, there are Portrait, Landscape, Night Snapshot, Kids & Pets, Indoor, Night Schene, Sunset, Foliage, Snow, Beach, Fireworks, Aquarium, and ISO 3200.  The colors can be changed to Vivid, Neutral, Sepia, Black & White, or a color scheme of your own creation.  The ISO ranges from 80 to 3200, and the white balance works very well.  The camera can even be set to take pictures at the full 10 megapixels or a smaller 6 mp, 4 mp, or even 2 mp resolution for email attachments.  The automatic settings produce very nice pictures, but even more stunning results can be obtained by adjusting the different functions.  A great camera for amateurs as well as those who have more of an idea what they are doing.  The image stabilization and face-finder features are nice, although I don't really notice that IS does much.  It is very informative to have a setting in Review that shows the different brightness levels for the picture displayed, as well as all of the various settings that were employed when it was taken.  The size of the camera is also very convenient, and it seems to be of sturdy construction.  The only complaints I might have are the length of recharge time for the flash and the length of write time for videos to the SD card, but these have more to do with the batteries and SD card than the actual camera.  I also wish it had a Panorama setting, which if it does have I haven't discovered it yet.

So, I just needed something basic for family memories.  I would have preferred something with a lithium rechargeable battery since they are smaller and they battery life is great.  However, the Powershot A1000IS (which I paid $129 for less than a year ago here at amazon)was a great choice.I wouldn't pay the current listed amazon price of $399 for it but it's a great basic camera for what I paid.  I use inexpensive eneloop rechargeable batteries and they are more than sufficient.  Easy to use, especially if you're accustomed to using Canons.  Takes movies.

(I've owned several Canons.) I'm an experienced photobug and, after reviewing the controls, I took my new A1000IS to a child's bowling alley birthday party. What a disappointment! Due to extreme shutter lag that I haven't seen since the earliest digitals, I missed shot after shot as the kids raced around me. The exposures and flash performance weren't great either. I immediately returned the camera. It doesn't begin to compare with my wonderful (and rave-reviewed) Fuji FinePix F30, which has developed a shutter problem after several years of service. My only difficulty with the F30 was lack of an optical viewfinder, so that in bright sunlight I was literally shooting blind, just pointing in the direction of the subject. I thought I would solve that with the Canon Powershot A1000IS -- but no such luck! I'd buy another FinePix F30 if they were still available; however, the newer Fujis haven't received comparable reviews.

If I go anywhere I think I will film video, I always take at least 4 extra AA batteries along.  Same with flash photography.  Take a few photos and the battery icon starts flashing.  It seems like it rips off the top of batteries, turns them upside down, and pours out all the juice.  Another thing which happened is the view screen became out of focus.  It looks like a TV screen back in the day when you could barely pick up a station using an antenna.  This just happened one day out of the blue.  I don't know what caused it and it never improved.  The photos and video still come out like they did before, but I always have to explain that if anyone uses my camera, because they think the photo didn't come out.

Almost everything is similar with few upgrades. It is 10 megapixels so obviously the image has more pixels and must be more sharp and crisp but I do not find any difference between A560 (7.1mp) and A1000is (10mp).I have taken great pictures using both cameras and I still have both and both working without any issues. It is easier to carry this camera in a pocket becaue it has no edges like the A560 but it could be slighty tricky for some to handle in one hand.

The viewfinder is pretty good it is useful for battery conservation and sunny days but it doesn't show the entire picture and you can't see the digital zoom (I could with my old camera).The 4x zoom is ok my old camera had 10x zoom but it was huge. The digital zoom is 4x so that helps to get in close to the shot.The camera's body is simply magnificent, it feels sturdy but isn't heavy. The colors are nice (I got the grey one). The plastic looks and feels like it is of high quality so I don't think it will break easily (although I don't recommend throwing it at the ground). The plastic also feels smooth. There is some metal mixed in there around the lens when it is closed.The pictures that this camera takes are beautiful. They are some of the best I've seen. They aren't close to a dslr but compared to similar cameras the pictures that it takes are superior. It doesn't matter if you're shaking the camera or if the subject is moving around the camera still takes crystal clear pictures. The video quality is amazing I have never seen a point and shoot camera record video as well as this camera does.The camera is easy to use and turns on almost instantly, it turns of even faster.

I've had two other Canons and have loved them both (3000+ photos with the A75 before passing it on to my mother, and 4800+ with the A530 before passing it on to boss).  This one is starting out to be quite amazing too and I hope to get at least 5000+ photos with it over the next few years.First gripe is with trying to actually get a purple one.  My order via Amazon reseller was cancelled by them.  Ended up getting through B.B. for about the same price.  Not too big of a deal.I recommend resigning the included 32MB SD card to a drawer or for your tax records backups.  Pick up a couple 4GB class \"C6\" microSDHC cards with a SD and USB adapter.  The USB adapter is necessary if you want to get to the root folder on the card (for CHDK access) and/or don't like using included software.The included batteries are good for experimenting and getting used to the camera.  Just be sure to pick up and charge some Energizer or Duracell NiMH rechargables before that trip to Disney.Customizing the camera--splash screen and sound effects: nope.  Even though they included the software to do it, the camera does not support the feature to upload different pics and sound files.  A Canon CSR verified this.  Sadly, the fancy colored case is as custom as they want you to get.  (Actually, it wasn't a very requested feature and I doubt there will ever be any firmware upgrades to include it.)\"Long Shutter\" for tripod night shots: I thought it could do it but it took a while to find.  In \"P\" mode, press FUNC. SET button (takes to EXPosure adjust), press DISPlay button and use left/right navigation to scroll between 1 and 15-second exposure times.Cases:  just about all cases will make this camera look huge.  I sewed my own using some scrap fabric, Velcro and webbing for a belt loop.  For store bought, just take your camera with you to test fit it.Recording videos: no optical zooming while recording, so set the zoom to what you need before hitting the button.  Digital zoom works if it is enabled, but I generally keep mine turned off.That's about it for having it a week.

I received the camera about 6 days after the online order was place. No problems with any shipping part of the transaction and the shipping was free.After reading many reviews and ratings on this camera I can say it has lived up to it's high reviews. The camera has a solid & heavy feel to it unlike alot of competitors plastic feeling cameras.I do a lot of uploading small edited videos to Youtube and the video quality portion of this camera is better than my present combo camera I had been using and the video is done in .mpeg instead of .mov like many other brands. Another reason for the quality is that this camera has glass lens in it unlike many comptetors cameras whose have plastic lens.As far as still picture quality goes this camera is better than any digital camera I've ever owned and I've had many different brands since digital cameras have been developed.It's simple to use for first time users as well as more experienced users. It has many standard point & shoot features and has a limited manual mode to adjust WB,ISO,Color settings and limited exposure settings.It has built in red eye removal of the finished picture, great self timer feature and good continuous shooting mode which works great if your not using the flash. Flash recharge (about 5 sec.) is a little slow but I think it's about normal for this size and price.I have taken many action pictures in the past month and not a blurry one in the bunch.  In other reviews on this camera I have read are some complaints about battery life. I did wear out the standard alkaline batteries that came with the camera in less than a day but think that was due mostly to setting up and playing all day with my \"New Toy\".I use rechargeable AA batteries and have not had any battery drain problems out of the ordinary since. As with any new digital camera or camcorder it would be wise to use rechargeable.The camera comes with a very tiny memory supplied SD card which is only good for a few pictures. It is more of a \"starter\" SD card and should be replaced with either a 2,4,8 or 16GB SD or SDHC card as soon as possible since the camera does not have any internal picture storage capacity.All in all this is a great first time user or even a somewhat experienced user point & shoot camera and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for good quality at a great price.", "Date": "July 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome Point and Shoot Camera", "Author": "sprkl527", "ReviewID": "R1NX3MQDDFKFMW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this camera today and imediatelly love how small it is and how easy it was to operate.

Photos taken using the digital zoom are noticeably of lower quality, but useful for photos going into the photo album. All in all its a great camera to have as a back-up when the bigger camera is not convenient or not needed, and as a main camera for those who just like to get great shots of vacations and family events.

Taking indoor shots in a large room, the flash is inadequate, about 5 Ft is max.  The flash/mode controls are not easily changed on the fly and are somewhat confusing.  Our older Canon was easier in this aspect.  Pictures were not as good as our Canon SD-1100is, which I'd strongly recommend if you want a compact that takes better pictures than some of the \"big boys.\"And consider this; If you are prone to misplacing or loosing small things, consider a larger camera.

The technical quality of the images is usually good, but I prefer being able to make my own settings with f-stops, shutter speed and focus.  The A100IS has the options for manual control, but because of the poorly organized instruction manual, and the complex and unintuitive menu organization I have found it difficult to work with this camera with any assurance of success. It is just too complex for me. So - I have pretty much gone back to my film cameras - that way I know  I won't miss the important moment that won't come again.

Case in point, every time I went to take a picture of our Yorkie, I'd get a picture of our floor - it cannot keep up with kids and pets - and you can't exactly ask a dog to \"do that again.\"  I bought this camera in January 09 and when we went on our honeymoon Oct 09 it flat out stopped working.  Just froze up.  Thank god we had brought my husbands waterproof pentax with us or we would have no pictures from our honeymoon.  We used some of our wedding money to purchase a Nikon since then.
