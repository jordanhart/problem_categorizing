The lens itself was better quality construction than I expected and is great for shots of the moon.  I didn't expect much as far as the lens quality and when zooming all the way in it definitely isn't poster quality photos but it can still be fun.  When the lens is fully extended there is a little more play in the tube than I expected but Other than that it's great.  I really like the mono pod that came with it for hikes and works well with my smaller lenses but I have to use a tripod and a remote shutter trigger with this lens because of the massive zoom it's impossible to hold an image perfectly still.  The best part is all the looks you get from passers by when you whip out this massive lens.  I've had other photographers come over amazed thinking that I was a top end photographer.  Great lens for the budget minded enthusiast.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "What can you expect for the price?", "Author": "JP ELLIS", "ReviewID": "R3RJZVOSTQQ6NC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Considering the price of this lens I was actually surprised it worked as well as it did. It's definately not a top of the line lens, but being that most super telephotos, especially with a zoom, that are top of the line cost thousands of dollars. That being said I decided I would probably never spend that much on a lens unless I was being paid a lot of money for my pictures. I chose to get the cheapie lower end lens and I'm not terribly dissapointed.You won't be taking action shots or doing anything really fast since it takes a while to set up, focus, and snap your photo. You will also need a sturdy tripod. The monopod works well in a pinch or on hikes (mostly as a walking stick) but to get a decent ammount of light in the lense you'll need a slow shutter speed which causes blurring if you're not perfectly still. I, like other people have said, use a remote shutter release to minimize shaking.When zoomed all the way out, the lens is a bit unstable. there is a \"locking ring\" to tighten down which steadies the lense and also makes sure it doesn't zoom in or out once you've set it where you want. The ring does help a bit.The photo's I've taken (with a tripod, slow shutter speed, remote trigger, and decent ammount of light) came out better than I expected. For that reason I would reccomend this lens as long as you're not wanting to shoot action shot at the next NASCAR event or football game. You could however carry this lens along with you and people will think you're some kind of professional photo journalist since it is pretty big and impressive looking. (just kidding)In summary, Good pictures as long as you set them up right and take your time. Definately not a Canon \"L series\" lens, but much more affordable than them also.", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "It is what it is - a basic high power telephoto lens", "Author": "Hammer", "ReviewID": "R4AZQ8UDRSEPR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This lens promised nothing other than it being a high-power telephoto lens with appropriate F stops for the price.  And, that is what it is.  I can photo my garden about 300 feet from my porch and see striations on the peppers.  It is manually focused and the camera I set on AE (aperature priority) because I am not good manually focusing.  But, bottom line is that with proper operator and lighting the lens produces decent results.  It is long and heavy due to its 1300/2600 capability so a good tripod is recommended and if you have the capability, a remote shutter control.  Overall however I personally think it is more than what you should expect for the money spent.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product, Not so greatly packed when shipped!", "Author": "Andrew Persing", "ReviewID": "R3DXRH0V1YFGEH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was happy when I got my package and the kit came with some many little pieces to help me along the way when I'm shooting but the lens itself had broken out of the packaging and was bouncing around the box inside of it's carrying case.  Basically it had some bubble wrap and then the products and them more bubble wrap like a sandwich.I was happy with what I purchased I just wish they would have put another minute or two in packaging my products.All in all the lens is like a tank and if you know how to use it, it works perfect.For amateur photographers, you just have to understand how to use the lens if you want nice photos as with any lens.For professional photographers it's not the super high end Canon lens that everyone would love to use but for under $300.00 there should be no one complaining about this beast.Yes it is a bit heavy and not an easy lens to just throw in your bag but it will let you take those long distance shots with the right set up.Skip all the review videos on youtube and  take it from me, all you really need to use this lens good is a nice tripod and the monopod this kit comes with.Use the tripod for your camera and the monopod to hold up the lens.  Easy as that.Hope this helps anyone looking to buy this kit!Andy", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "rokinon", "Author": "Patrick Giannaccini", "ReviewID": "R2OLJT4NZSOYM3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "if you are serious about photography do NOT get this lens i made a big mistake this lens is far from sharp stick to the brand of your camera or sigma/tamron", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "item is not practical, not a good buy", "Author": "Preshas Jenkins", "ReviewID": "R3LBOZDGM3EX2F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Item has a pretty good zoom distance,  but its horribly unstable.

Pro football photographers/cameramen, to national geographic. I know a little bit about cameras and i've been around the block. This lens defies the odds of price. My friend who is a regular photographer of football games in the Maryland area, (ravens/redskins) has a few telephoto lenses that are into the $20k range. They need a tripod pretty much to use. but they feel solid. Thats pretty much what 20k is going to get you is the lens is going to feel expensive. Quality however? this lens can top them even when zoomed in. Ive used it with a canon mark 3 for video and stills on a tripod of course...and wow, was i surprised. The lens is mostly plastic, the levers are alittle loose and zooming in and out is a pain, but like all camera equipment, you just get used to it after about 10 mins of fooling with it. Use a tripod if shooting anywhere but direct sunlight. Seriously. even in the late evening.Overall this is an EXCELLENT lens for the price, you simply can't beat that price for the amount of zoom you get. It may feel a little cheap, but hey, beggars cant be choosers, plus it gets the job done. Words of wisdom for this lens though...get a tripod.  For quality i would give it an 8/10 and price? 10/10", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good but too heavy.", "Author": "R.
