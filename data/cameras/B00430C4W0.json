The instructions do not match the device and even contradict themselves from page to page.  The screen turns on and the increase zoom function works.  Nothing else works as far as I can tell (including decrease zoom).  The mode button changes from video to pictures to viewing, but neither capturing video nor taking pictures works.  When I first start the devise, the screen displays a message stating there is an error with the card, asking if I want to format it (yes) or not (no).  There is no way to choose either selection.  Hitting the mode button is the only thing that does anything, but as noted above, the modes do not work.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fake Product in Empty Case", "Author": "Drake", "ReviewID": "RZHW0ZE4JAYL3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this product and it is fake.
