She loved it but the biggest surprise has been how much I like it too.  This may be the most inexpensive digital camera around but the clarity of the pictures has amazed me.A couple of tips for other novice buyers: a digital zoom is not a zoom lens!  It just means you can zoom in when viewing the picture on the screen.  If you like the flexibility of a zoom lens, consider buying a slightly more expensive camera.  And, of course, you'll have to buy a memory chip to slot into this camera as the internal memory only holds 16 shots.  It's a rip off that seems to be practised by all the camera manufacturers.  The memory chip I bought increases storage to 153 photos which will do most normal users for a long time.We had one initial problem when the computer software provided wouldn't load onto my iMac due to the old version of OSX I am using.  However, I then discovered that I could simply plug the camera in to the USB port (1.0 not 2.0) and they downloaded in seconds!  I just use Preview to view them which isn't ideal but no doubt the software will be fine when I get around to upgrading my computer.We did not own a digital camera before this.  I have to say I am now completely converted to the benefits of digital photography and planning on buying one of my own.", "Date": "December 3, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great deal, but you might want something better", "Author": "A Customer \"customer12345657\"", "ReviewID": "R3JGS0QHDG2FGV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a good price for the picture quality, but you might want to spend more to get a slightly better camera.Good stuff:If you want a digital camera for convenience, but were otherwise happy with a cheap 35mm camera just for 5x7 prints or smaller, this is probably the best deal.Overall picture quality is better than most digital cameras under $100, so it's the best way to go if you want a cheap digital camera.It's also very simple.  If you want \"easy-to-use,\" this is as easy as it gets.  There aren't any complicated options, and almost everything is automated \"behind the scene\" so you don't have to think about it.Bad stuff:Slow shutter response.  Compared to film cameras, most digital cameras of any reasonable price have a slight delay between clicking the button and the actual picture being captured, which can cause you to miss some shots.  This camera is about typical for the price range, but you can get a lot better if you move up to a better camera.Digital zoom only.  Digital zoom is not really a zoom at all, but an enlargement of a small area on the sensor inside the camera.  You can \"zoom,\" but picture quality degrades in the same proportion.  For the price, almost no camera has real optical zoom, so this is average.No close-up ability.  The focus range is fixed, which actually works out OK for small prints, but anything closer than about 3 feet will look blurry.  A lot of cheap cameras have a \"macro\" switch to allow better close shots, so this camera is actually behind the pack on this.No lense protection at all.  There is a plastic window, but it isn't protected either and if it get's dirty or scratched it's still a problem.  Many cheaper cameras have a sliding lense cover.Other options:It's a good deal if you want a camera for this price, but for $40-50 more, you can get a Sony or Canon that resolves or greatly improves all of these problems.  You might want to look at a Sony s40, Canon a410, or whichever models are current when you read this.Don't worry too much about \"easy-to-use.\"  Any digital camera in a similar price range will have an auto mode, which means all you have to do is click the shutter button and it figures everything out on its own just like this Kodak does.  The simpler menu is still appealing if you don't want extra options, but other cameras won't be hard to use.Some other reviews mention the low included memory.  This is true of ALL digital cameras.  Most only have enough built-in memory for about 10 pictures, so plan on buying a $15-25 card no matter which camera you buy.", "Date": "March 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "It's a camera.

It can take good pictures provided that there is enough outdoor light but almost 50% of my pictures were blurry in most indoor situations. This is even while making a great effort to hold my hands steady. Trying to get good photos in low light situations without a tripod was nearly impossible. The ISO settings on this baby do not seem to be sufficient for low light and there is no image stabilization to speak of. Buying a camera with no optical zoom was my biggest mistake.  The digital zoom does nothing but degrade your picture quality.  Finally, there may be a quality issue with the battery compartment door hinges as mine will no longer close properly.  I have to keep it shut with tape just for the batteries to make contact with the terminals.I upgraded to a 6X Optical Zoom Panasonic Lumix and have been very satisfied.  I gave the Kodak C300 to my 12 yr old daughter.If you buy this camera:1. Please take more than one shot of your subject because you will have to discard one of the pics.2. It sucks down batteries.  Use rechargeables.3. Extremely simple to use.  One of its advantages.4. Don't even try to zoom in on a person/object.  Poor picture quality is the result.5.
