Almost everyone has this camera around me. We really love it, because it has a strong function on making self-photos. Do you want to take a beautiful photo for yourself? It is the best choice for that. Now I will introduce its advantages and weaknesses.I really want to recommend this camera for young females who love photographs. There is an attractive function, the camera can embellish the photo automatically. If you have freckle or pimple, this camera will help you to embellish these problems. In addition, Casio Tr-150 camera can beautifies the color of whole photo, making your skin look better than reality and you are very thin in the camera. This function is very interesting, and this is a reason why I choose it. Another good thing is that the screen of the camera can rotate 360 degrees. That means when you take photo, you can see your face on the screen, so it can catch the most beautiful you. These two functions are the best characteristics of the camera, and Tr-150 is the first one which uses these functions. The camera is also very small and easy to take.Of course, there are some weaknesses that need to be improved. The first one, the camera's pixel is very low, it just has 12.1 MP. So if you are a professional, this camera doesn't fit your, because it was limited by pixel and you cannot take the photos far from you. Second, sometimes Tr-150 is fuzzy because of the function of beautify. If you aspire to clear pictures and details, then this camera is not good for you. Third, the marketing was limited, because most of Americans like good quality. So the Casio just opens the Asian market, and this camera is not produced in the U.S. This is the reason why Tr-150 is not popular in Americans and Asians love this camera so much.In general, I love this camera so much. Its advantages overcome with its weaknesses. Casio Tr-150 is good for a party, if you want to take a photo with your friends during the party, it can help you to do it well. If you try it once, you will love it. These are my advice of Casio Tr-150, and it is a good camera for young girls, like me. So if you are interested on this camera, don't miss it.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice pictures!
