{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fujifilm Finepix S9100 - A Very Good Camera", "Author": "John C. \"Fine Artist\"", "ReviewID": "R1WPZQ9XM7CWQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera about a month ago and have taken approximately 2,000 pictures to date. I've taken indoor, outdoor, telephoto, macro, everything except the video. Sorry I should have played with that too, but it is not the primary reason I bought this camera.  I wanted a camera that expanded the capability and control of my small point and shoot camera, an Olympus C-50 (which I am quite pleased with). I am very happy with the results of the S9100.This is a substantial camera.  It feels more like my Nikon 8008, so don't plan to put it in your pocket when you take it on a trip. I have had three Olympus digital cameras and was looking to purchase another Olympus but I was disappointed with their offering in the ultra zoom class.Because I already had several xD cards it was a plus that this camera gave me a choice of two different media types. I also liked the manual zoom because this camera felt familiar, like an SLR. Using AA batteries was another plus I was looking for. I see some folks say they are disappointed with the battery life, but I haven't found that to be a problem.  I use 2900mAh NiMH Rechargeable Battery and I have yet to run out of juice on  photo shoots of over 200 pictures.  I have not used alkaline batteries, but I understand they do not last nearly as long. I use the EVF more than the large digital display (probably from old habits of 35mm cameras) and that may have something to do with it too.  I think the manual zoom has to save a lot of battery power when compared to some of the competition.There is a lot of discussion about image stabilization, and I never had it in my other cameras, so I don't seem to miss it. I haven't had many blurred photos but I do use a mono-pod or tri-pod when it is appropriate. But even hand held, this camera produces excellent images even up at 1600 ISO.  There is some noise, but I don't think it is too bad.  Printed photos come out excellent.  I have several printers and a large format HP plotter that can produce 36\" x 36\" prints and I am very pleased with the results.This camera has excellent versatility, the zoom is great and the macro mode gives you wonderful capability to really get in close.  I have been shooting primarily .JPG  but have experimented with .RAW. From what I read this format it will extend my ability, but I need more time to learn about RAW processing before I can provide an intelligent discussion. I like the idea that RAW is there if and when I decide to use it.In conclusion, I am happy with my purchase and would buy this camera again. If you are looking for an alternative to a dSLR that provides a lot of versatility and control this one merits a close look.", "Date": "February 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent wide angle to telephoto zoom.", "Author": "BoolaBoola \"Nutmegger\"", "ReviewID": "R1WQMX3FDYC9BQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I know someone who passed on buying the Fuji S9100 because it only had a 10.7x zoom, in favor of a 12x zoom. She did not understand how to interpret the lens specs.This camera has something fairly rare in a digital camera, and especially rare in a super zoom: a true wide angle lens, going down to 28 mm equivalent focal length. Most digitals start at 38 mm or 35 mm. That extra 7 to 10 mm makes a huge difference in the angle of coverage.I had a 28 to 85 mm zoom for my 35 mm slr, and it cost more than the S9100, and weighed more, too. And here you are getting a lens that goes all the way to 300 mm. My longest zoom lens only went to 200 mm on my 35 mm, and it started at 75 mm. That weighed several times more than this camera, and was hard to hold steady. I rarely used a 200 mm without a tripod.With the S9100 I still use the wideangle most, but I am surprised how much I use the 300 mm telephoto. It also has a 2x digital zoom, which, because it has a 9 mp sensor, is actually useable, though I would shoot at lower resolutions. And I am surprised how sharp the pictures are, even without image stabilization. But then I know how to steady a camera, such as leaning it against a wall.I use the tilting LCD display a lot. It is great for candids; which is especially important with a semi-pro camera like this. It is not just about being secretive; it is about retaining the candid quality of the photo.Attach the neck strap and use it, always, always. Combine it with the LCD display flipped out and you get a sort of TLR effect: It was easier to hold a TLR Rolleiflex steady at slow shutter speeds than an SLR held to the eye. The trick is to pull the strap tight against your neck and lock your elbows against your sides.Remember, you can always crop a picture to produce more of a telephoto effect, especially with a 9 mp image. But you can't widen a picture in processing -- unless you use panorama stitching (anyone even actually use this???).The S9100 has the best video recording I have used in a digicam. With the manual zoom, it is easy to zoom during filming, silently. Going from 28 mm to 300 mm creates a powerful effect.This lens is magnificent. It is essentially the same lens as is on the 6000, I believe. Fuji knows how to make lenses. Their medium format wideangle lenses, such as for the GW690, are legendary. Having a fixed lens barrel, while less compact, is far more sturdy. Those telescoping lenses are fragile if knocked while the camera is on.Fuji also knows how to make film. And in the digital era, the camera is the film. Their expertise in color management is evident in the accurate, pleasing tonal quality indoors or out; but it helps if you know how to use the manual color balance setting. There is a chrome setting which boosts the saturation and contrast, intended to match the qualities of slide film. It is great for average snap shots, but can produce over saturation with things like colorful flowers.I have used this camera for about four months. I haven't used all the bells and whistles regularly. I tested the manual focus, and it is well-designed, with focus assist via directional arrows, plus the ability to magnify the central section. I see it more as an extended focus lock.I have used several external flashes with it, and the camera still works. Some camera brands can be damaged by flashes with a high trigger voltage, reportedly. A bounce flash will help you get pro looking shots indoors.I use the 800 iso setting for night shots. There is some grain, but that's life. I come from a film perspective, and the grain is about what you would get from shooting b&w; at that speed. When I switch the S9100 to BW, the grain becomes less noticeable, and makes the 1600 iso setting more useable. I also cut the resolution at iso 800 and 1600. Reducing the contrast and sharpening also seems to help. As I see it, the iso 1600 is there for use when there is no alternative. A newspaper photographer could get useable shots with it.I seriously considered the Fuji S6000 because of its superior high film speed performance. But it is 6 mp, and lacks some of the S9100's more advanced features. If you need less grain in your high iso shots, the S6000 may be a better bet. The S6000 would be an excellent camera for a newspaper to hand to a reporter.But the grain in the S9100 is not as bad as some say; I, and others, think they are looking at the full magnification images, which at 9 mp can be about three feet wide or more, depending on your monitor. THEN you can see the grain at the pixel level in even the 200 iso shots. So what?I often shoot at less than 9 mp. The camera has a 3:2 setting that gives a wider ratio more like a 35 mm shot. It also produces a smaller file, about 2.5 mb. That's what I use the most. It is especially suitable to wideangle shots. But I also am getting fine results in lower resolutions.This camera originally sold for twice the price, at least when the S9000 came out, and it was a good value then. Now it is one of the great camera bargains on the market. But it may be more camera than some people need. This is probably true of a lot of fancy cameras on the market. Don't buy a camera to make a fashion statement; buy something you will enjoy using.For me, the Fuji S9100 is fun to use; it is easy to get great pictures without getting a headache.", "Date": "July 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best Bang for the Buck", "Author": "Giang T. Vu \"giangtvu144701\"", "ReviewID": "RIAZI7GMIH34U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, I don't even know where to start for this camera. But about a year ago, when this camera first got launched to the digital camera market, it costed nearly twice as much as what you can pay for it now. For the price, this camera has alot to offer. I just love the color tone of Fujifilm. You get a very studio-like effect with Fujifilm CCD technology. This camera has many manual controls and features that will interest both professional and amature photographers. The 9 Megapixel can really be helpful when it comes to cropping. The pictures taken by this camera is bright and clear. The camera picture can be noisy if you set the ISO above 400. So, for the best result, just set the ISO level as low as possible (lets say ISO 80?). The 10.7X zoom lens is very convenient when you want to get close to the subject you are shooting. I used this camera for every occasion and it never failed me. I heard alot of complaints about the poor battery life of this camera, but just buy NiMH battery that is about 2500 mAh and above and you should get about 200-250 shots. Make sure to buy at least a 2 GB memory card because the picture files are pretty big, especially in RAW format. Also, for the price, this camera feels VERY SOLID in the hand. It feels very professional and sturdy (MADE IN JAPAN). The buttons are nicely placed and very easy to use. Make sure to buy an external flash if you want to do some serious light photography. I recommnend the Sunpak 383 non-dedicatted flash to go with this camera. It works together really well. Anyway, for $407, you cannot get a better camera than this one. Thank you Amazon for making this good deal possible. Again, I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "February 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera in Manual Mode", "Author": "Melissa Guaman", "ReviewID": "R23AQWNTQ9S5Z3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera since November 2006.I would have liked to have given the S9100 five stars, but the auto mode leaves something to be desired. To get the best images, you really need to use the manual settings.I have had excellent success in all areas with this camera. I have taken crystal clear macro shots of jewelry- a notoriously difficult subject. I have taken great indoor, low-light shots without flash. I have had difficulty with the auto focus in these special situations. But the manual focus is easy to use. Color and contrast are true to life. I have been able to take pictures in situations that I couldn't have dreamed of with any of the point-and-shoot models that I have used.Some people have complained about the graininess of higher ISO settings. You can select your ISO in auto mode. Mine stays at 80 most of the time. I use only use 1600 when I want the grainy effect. You can not select the ISO in stabilization mode. Flash exposure compensation is selectable in P,S,A and M modes. It has 5 settings.Battery life is good, but then again, I almost never use flash. The low light capabilities are so good that I don't need it most of the time. My Energizer 2500 mAh NiMH batteries last for hundreds of shots. Sorry, I never really counted exactly how many. I rarely need to change them during a session.The lens is threaded 58mm, so you can add filters if desired. You can also use a shutter release cable. I have not experimented with RAW much because I use Paint Shop Pro for editing, and it requires that my RAW images be converted to Tiff to manipulate.This camera is excellent if you:1. Read the manual2. Use manual settings3. PracticeIf you are looking for a point-and-shoot. This probably isn't the camera for you. However, the creative controls are excellent. I highly recommend this model for the serious amateur.", "Date": "May 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent once you get it out of Auto...", "Author": "R. Newman", "ReviewID": "R3TP412ACDL58R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as something a bit more capable, but not as expensive as an SLR. With a zoom equivalent to a 300 mm lens on an SLR, I certainly saved myself a heap of money over buying an SLR setup with the same capacities.I use this camera mostly in manual. That was my aim in buying it - to get more proficient in using the manual settings. A few times I have switched it to auto, and haven't been all that impressed. The autofocus seems a little unpredictable, but there is a single press manual focus button on the left side, as well as a focusing ring, and these do me very well indeed. I don't think I would recommend this camera to someone who wanted to use it mostly as a point and shoot.It loses one star mostly because of its poor macro capability. For really really good closeups it just doesn't come close to my Konica Minolta DImage Z6.I was a bit lost without image stabilization at first. This camera compensates for not having this by jacking up the film speed when in auto, and if I want to use it in manual and handhold, of course I have to do the same. Since I use a tripod a lot, this is not too much of an issue for me. I've heard a lot of bad press on the graininess at higher ISO, but I have found them to be at least as good as film if not better.The colors are great. I love my range of menu options, though there is nothing too extraordinary about them. This camera has more buttons than some, but once I got used to them, they make my selections so much faster when I am shooting in changing light conditions.I like the fact I can use a cable release with this camera. I have used it for quite a bit of low light work, and the fact that I can dial it right down to a twenty second shutter speed or even to B is fantastic.I've found it pretty hard to find image editing software to work directly with raw images from this camera.It's working really well for me as a prosumer camera. However, I still think that if I could go back, I might go for a Panasonic DMC-FZ50 10.1MP instead. Maybe. I would have to check that one out more thorougly first.", "Date": "February 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm S9100", "Author": "W. F.

I considered the Sony H7 and H9, the Canon S3 IS, and the Fuji s6000fd. The Sony's clearly had lesser image quality and terrible purple fringing not to mention being overpriced. The S3 IS was decent and probably the third best superzoom but it was already aged quite a bit and the S5 IS had been announced which turned out not me be much of an improvement over the S3 IS anyways. The Fuji s6000fd comes closest in image quality to the s9100, some even say that it is better. Now, its obvious the Fuji models have no method of optical image stabilization but its a small price to pay for the excellent image quality than comes from these two Fuji super zooms. What made the s9100 a winner for me was the flash hot shoe, excellent EVF, manual zoom, and manual focus (don't worry, it also has autofocus).", "Date": "July 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "A very useful camera.", "Author": "Jay Moynihan", "ReviewID": "RYQ659T8PS2V1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was my first digital camera, other than a Nikon L4.

Has a good balance of features, good optics, etc. I would recommend it to:Someone that does not want to go to DSLR, but is used to film and manual lens work, and wants an all-in-one camera.While a beginner can use it, I would think this model would be most satisfying for a person who has been doing photography for awhile.Pluses for me (so far):28mm wide end.Has a real cable release!The most recent update of Adobe Photo Raw 4.1 recognizes this camera, and the similar s6000fd.

(This one can also take compact flash though).While it is not an issue for me, (i use mine mainly on a tripod shooting RAW anyway), the time lag to write a RAW file is long.

I enjoy the 28 - 300 mm (35 mm equiv) zoom, though there are a few times a 500-600 mm would be better. However, I don't want to lug around the equivalent lenses for a DSLR. I want to get rid of the weight and complexity.  The pictures are sharp, true to color and easy. I found the previous commenters tipped me off to an important part of using the camera: read the manual and experiment with the various setting combinations. I think I love most of all the automatic bracketing. I set it for 2/3 stop over and under and it shoots 3 pictures in rapid succession: one \"right,\" one 2/3 over-exposed, on 2/3 under-exposed. Thus, I get one perfect out of the set. This does not function in raw mode. I have found raw mode with ISO 100 is great, but I think I will settle for the auto-bracketing function with jpg most of the time.  Olympus and Fuji have the reputation for the closest to true colors and I wanted that, even though some Canon cameras are widely touted. I made my decision after a few reviews of the Canon IS5 were out and I had a chance to get the Canon in my own hands. I personally prefer the manual zoom of the Fuji S9100.  I put a 58 mm skylight filter on it right away. Good thing I did, I had some sort of liquid drop on the lens (filter) within the first week.

So after a month of ownership here is my review:1. DO NOT buy this camera if you want a point and shoot camera.  It is a horrible point and shoot camera.2. DO NOT buy this camera if you want a camera that can shoot in lower or low light situations.3. DO NOT buy this camera if you ever want to manually shoot faster than ISO 200.This camera is very noisy. Images shot faster than ISO 400 are noisier than a $10 junk kids digital camera. I read all the reviews about how if you wanted to shoot good pictures you needed to do everything manually, so I spent the last month reading the manual trying to get better lower light pictures. It just isn't going to happen.I am now finding many more reviews to support what I have found out the hard way. If you are shooting ISO 80 or 100 your going to have some pretty good pictures. ISO 200 is still not too bad. ISO 400 is as noisy as some other cameras ISO 1600 shots. ISO 800 shots are unacceptably noisy and anything shot at 1600 is completely useless and unusable.This camera uses a faster shot instead of image stabilization and while that in itself is not such a bad thing the noise present in those faster shots is not acceptable. One of the big reasons this cameras auto mode is useless is that it will often use ISO 400 or faster which makes the auto mode useless if you want a good picture.One of the main reasons I bought this camera was that it had a manual focus option to use in my low light situations. The manual focus is still direct linked to the auto focus and is not a true manual. If you run it out to infinity in hopes of getting focused on those far shots your in for a cruel surprise. The manual focus at infinity goes past infinity and back out of focus. Even when you back up a bit your at the mercy of the focus motor to start and stop moving when it wants as it lags behind your actual moving of the manual focus ring.Macro modes do not focus well up close at all where they should, and forget manual focus for macros because the auto focus will take over and take the picture back out of focus even on manual mode when clicking the shutter.While video quality is not bad on this camera but the auto focusing while in video mode is very bad. It focuses too slow and has to keep trying to refocus. The auto focus does not work well in many cases. Some times it will show a good focus lock and after you look at the pictures you will often find that it was not in focus at all.This camera has got plenty of bells and whistles and had a great potential but the fact they used an older sensor took it all away. The manual focus is a great idea but was poorly implemented.The bottom line is that this type of camera is supposed to make it easy to take good pictures while allowing you the options to go manual and change things but it should not be so hard to get 10 out of 1000 pictures to be worth keeping.This camera is not worth this kind of money to get a few good shots. The camera looks good and has plenty of features but in the end it's about what kind of pictures it takes on on that note it fails miserably.", "Date": "May 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm S9100 Not What I Expected", "Author": "Teacher Guy", "ReviewID": "RCM33XC7LLF45", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the FujiFilm S9100 from Amazon.com.

You can also quietly zoom when taking movies which is a plus but the camera takes a while to re-focus so half the movie seems out of focus which is a minus.If my old camera (S602) had the following features I'd never look for a new one.

The natural automatic setting is handy for outside off light shots and indoors too... Front threads allow for assorted filters add-on lenses, etc...

It performs well, in automatic mode, in my wife's hands and yet it has the complete range of controls that I require. In fact, the S9100 gives you everything you can ask for, from full auto to full manual (that includes manual focus, with the option of magnified center).Shots taken in fully automatic mode seldom need any adjustments, in Photoshop and even then, usually only a slight exposure or brightness adjustment may be required.It's easy to get to the controls that I use most. One button press and a turn of the wheel stops down/up. Two button presses and you can select 2 (or 10) seconds delay, for shooting time exposures on a tri-pod, without requiring a remote shutter cable. Also, a variety of scene modes makes setting up for certain common scene types a snap. A couple of presses of the Display button and you can overlay a cross hatch, to help you keep your image level. One button switches between viewfinder and the rear LCD display. In short, although there are many possible options, you should find the S9100 very easy to use and fast to adjust to specific situations. If you have any problems in this area, it might be that there are so many possibilities that learning all of the shortcuts might take a week or two.Speaking of the rear LCD display above, made me think of the fact that the rear display tilts down about 45 degrees, to allow for shooting overhead and up 90 degrees, to allow for shooting, while holding the camera low, as with certain large format cameras.The image quality is great at ISOs up to 400. Even above that, it's better than all but the most expensive dSLRs. There is no noticeable barrel distortion or other lens issues, common with extreme wide angle or telephoto lenses.Although I seldom use video recording with the S9100, I must admit that its video recording capability is more than acceptable. The only thing that it doesn't do in video, is HD. The main thing that it does that most other non-dSLR cameras won't do, is zoom, while filming. That's thanks to the manual zoom feature. Oh, yes. Speaking of video, the S9100 doesn't require an expensive fast memory card, in order to shoot unlimited video. Just use the cheapest (name brand) Flash memory card that you can find. It will work just fine.Speaking of memory, there are two memory card slots - one for Compact Flash and one for xD-Picture Card. The Compact Flash slot is Microdrive compatible. With 4 rechargeable NiMh AA batteries, you can shoot what seems like forever. That means that you can shoot all day, without having to carry additional batteries or memory.This camera functions very much like the more expensive dSLR cameras, but without the interchangeable lenses. But, with a 10.7X optical zoom and 9 megapixels, there is very little that you can't do with the S9100 that you can do with a dSLR. I would call it a great compromise camera, except for the fact that you have to make no real compromises.Guess what?

It sits beside a Minolta Dimage 5 and a Dimage 7.While the body and interface is basically the s7000 with a bigger, more manual lens, it's digital guts and firmware is more like the s5200's. All in all, this is the perfect marriage of the two with the addition of very good kit lens to finish the picture. The camera itself isn't made of metal like the Dimage 5 and Dimage 7, but it behaves exactly the same and takes the same quality of photos, albeit with noise suppression(nonexistent in the Dimage 5/7-series...all of which render the raw CCD data to a jpeg, which you either like or dislike)So yes, this camera is very comfortable to take pictures with, and I can understand why newbies to photography that buy this eventually drift towards a dSLR out of curiosity.

I outgrew a Canon S2 IS point and shoot, and this was a nice step upwards.First of all, if you're looking for an advanced point and shoot, you will not find it here.  This camera practically demands that you understand how a camera works and what the different settings will and will not do.  Without that knowledge base, you will probably find the camera overwhelming and be disappointed in the pictures that it takes.  This seems consistent with many of the negative reviews.  This camera WILL take some time and effort to learn.Now, having said all of that, if you know how to shoot a camera in manual mode and understand what the different settings do, then you will find a lot to like here, especially if you may not be ready to jump headlong into a full SLR.  The range on the lens is fantastic, and distortion is remarkably low.  It has a lot of cool features, and some good electronics operating inside of it.  Manual zoom really speeds up getting your shots lined up.  It will even shoot in RAW mode (although I would recommend a large capacity and FAST CF card if you're going to explore this mode).  It takes some getting used to, but once you do then you can produce some very nice shots.  Build quality is great, and it has a nice, solid feel in your hands.  Also you can add a non-dedicated flash to it and REALLY make it come alive.  I've never had battery life be an issue, then again I'm using high capacity rechargeables.Now for the demerits:  Yes, you will see grain and noise in anything above ISO 400.  If you can keep it at 200 or below, you'll be fine.  Again, if you use a tripod and understand the settings, you can work around this issue and shoot in the low ISO modes.  As for lack of image stabilization, personally I thought I would miss it but I've found I really don't.  At the risk of sounding like a broken record, learn the settings and you will still make some fantastic shots.  The reason it got 4 stars and not 5 is because of the noise issues.In short, if you're ready to move above the point and shoots and really want to learn about photography, and add some creativeness to your shooting, you'll find a lot to like here.
