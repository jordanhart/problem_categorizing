{"Reviews": [{"Title": "More Bang for your Buck", "Author": "Suzanne Aultman", "ReviewID": "R32TYAIGHQMMDN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has the best bang for your buck so to speak. I didn't buy it from Amazon because Best Buy had an awesome deal ($269). I have been researching a digital camera for awhile now. I am a complete novice, not evening owning a standard 35mm film camera. I had a crash course in digitals. I decided on the HP Photosmart R727 after much deliberation and research. I went to the Best Buy store, talked to the (actually) helpful (this time) sales people who were quite knowledgeable in the camera section and walked away with the HP.This camera has \"just about every option that you could want on it\" (direct quote from the sales person at Best Buy, as they had just returned from an HP workshop because this camera was released April 2006) for a compact digital. It's small enough to fit in a pocket, purse or just the palm of your hand. The menu is fantastic, very easy to use and understand (remember, I am a novice). It even has helpful tips each time you take a picture to help you take a better picture next time!I saw on Amazon that Canon cameras are the top seller, as well as at Best Buy. But what turned me off was the fact that not every option is included on their cameras (not to mention the price, it's outrageous and I can get more options on the HP for around $100 less). The main option not included on the Canon's was red-eye reduction. They DO NOT include that IN camera. The HP does. With the Canon you have to do it on your computer. The HP does it automatically as you take the picture. For a novice like me, this is critical. I prefer every helpful option to be included on the camera. Not to mention the complaints I hear from family members on how annoying trying to take out red eye is on their computer.Another difference I noticed from the Canon series with the HP R727 was that the HP has more digital zoom. The optical zooms (the most important) are the same, but the Canon only has 2x Digital zoom where as the HP has 8x. It just makes a more precise picture when zooming in close. The HP also has just a few more megapixels, just for a kicker.I really love this HP. I haven't found a flaw in it yet.", "Date": "May 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Super Sexy", "Author": "D.

My best guess is everyone has a different scale for rating good, fair, or poor condition.  Cosmetically this camera would be more like a poor to fair condition.  It works perfectly as it was listed. Quick shipping and packaging was done nicely although Im not sure why because it was already dented up =)  I purchased this to replace my daughters other concert camera because it takes amazing photos and isnt super expensive if she loses it.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "...just AWESOME!", "Author": "DJ JoHn ToWeRS", "ReviewID": "R1GZVC2ABG9313", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This has been my 4th camera I've owned and proud to have it...this doesn't count my past disposable cameras.I first bought this camera in November of 2007 and still use it to this day, that's a plus when thinking about owning a camera that will last you a while.PRO's:-Lithium battery. It's 100-240V rechargeable battery comes in handy, especially if you're a frequent traveler. I've always hated buying AA or AAA batteries.-Enlargements. I've had enlargements made up to 8X10 and still maintain its clarity. Nice!-Internal memory. I've had digital cameras before where they would only store pics/vids if you have a memory card. You can take up to 12 pics with this camera's internal memory at its maximun pixel quality. This is a small plus.-Zoom while video filming. My Canon SD780 IS, along with other great cameras cannot zoom in/out while video recording.-Effects. Oh the effects! This camera has the ability to apply phenomenal effects, while saving the previously modified picture. For instance, if 3 different effects are applied to the original photo, the original photo is kept as well as the each individual picture that gets modified with effects. Too cool!-Battery life. I haven't exactly timed the hours of usage while being on. But I've gone for weeks without charging it...granted I used the camera only about 10 times per day. I charges pretty quick, too.CON's-Shutter sound can be heard during playback, if it's used to zoom in/zoom out while video recording. This can be heard, especially if the surroundings while being recording is silent or not trying to be heard. I hope this makes sense.That's about it. Almost flawless! I highly recommended this camera, expert or novice.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great while it lasted, but not worth the money", "Author": "Disappointed", "ReviewID": "R2FGWMUPNKIEAH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I owned this camera (Photosmart R727) for about 15 months.  Took great pictures.  Easy to use.  Small size made it very convenient.  Had all the features I needed and battery life was great.  Unfortunately (and for no apparent reason) it experienced a hardware failure which immediately rendered the camera useless (no viewscreen).  After discussing with HP, they determined it was unrepairable.  So I basically have to buy a new camera.  After reading several other reviews, it appears this is not uncommon for this model.  I don't have much experience with other brands besides Kodak, but for a reliable long-term camera, I won't buy another HP.", "Date": "April 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "This is an expensive disposable camera", "Author": "Destiny", "ReviewID": "R1BQEPY7IKJ585", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera 14 months ago. I have had issues with it locking up which is annoying. Then one day I got a red screen and a 000000018-4489-957-000 error message. After researching, contacting HP and visiting discussion boards, I discovered it was a hardware problem. The long and the short of it is, once the hardware fails, the camera is done!  It will cost you around $150+ to fix it and HP thinks you should pay that after spending $250+ for the camera. Of course HP believes that 14 months is a reasonable amount of time to not make them liable for the junk they are manufacturing in China. It is clearly a manufacturing defect! Search the message boards and you will read about the frustrations of others with the hardware failure problem. Don't waste your money on the Photosmart line of products. I am going to stick with the traditional photo equipment manufacturers in the future.*****DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE PHOTOSMART LINE OF PRODUCTS.*****", "Date": "December 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Worst Camera I have ever owned.", "Author": "David Barry Lane \"Dave Lane\"", "ReviewID": "R2PL3PHACNO7Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It seems like the other two reviewers are happy with the pictures they get from this camera, but I am not. The camera takes really dark pictures no matter what setting you use. The only pictures that seem OK are outside photos in bright sunlight. I had a Kodak before that blew this camera away. I do have to say that I took the camera out of the box charged the battery and expected the auto mode to solve any problems.
