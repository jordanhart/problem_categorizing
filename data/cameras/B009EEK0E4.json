{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT package deal.  GET the T3i in this package with the IS lens", "Author": "Goodeknight", "ReviewID": "R24YROIZ1OEMYF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOVE the T3i.  With 18 megapixels, full HD video, and the Canon name, it'll still be high tech in 10 years +.  The two main upgrades from the T3 are 12.2 vs. 18 megapixels, and the fact that the T3i has an articulated screen.  And you WILL use the articulated screen often -- for overhead shots, low angle shots, self portraits, setting up tripod based video/still shots (flip the screen around so you can see your shot as you tweak backgrounds).Those two main points (megapixels and articulated screen) do make this package cost a good bit more than the equivalent T3 package, but the upgrades are well worth it.  The other upgrade within this package is the 55-250 IS lens.  The IS is the key - image stabilization.  The other option is a package with a 75-300mm lens without image stabilization.  A friend has that lens and said, \"It's practically worthless.  I'll sell it to you for 10 bucks.  I hate that lens.\"  Without IS, you're doomed unless it's a cloudless day at high noon, or you're carrying a tripod around with you, or you're zoomed out to less than 150mm or so.  I don't recall the exact numbers, but I believe IS gives you something like 4 additional stops before your shots get blurry.  That's major, and again, well worth the extra money.After an exhaustive search, I found Cardinal Camera had the best deal on a T3i package.  In fact, best deals anywhere on the T3i and a number of other cameras I was considering.  Came quickly in a carefully packed box.  Lots of goodies, though I will probably get some higher quality uv filters to protect my lenses - filters with multilayer coating to reduce glare.  If you want to carry the goodies around, they practically fill the included bag.  Not enough room for all of it, plus the camera.Next time I'm in the market for photography supplies, Cardinal Camera will be my first stop.  I don't know when that will be though.  I'm perfectly happy with my T3i.  Like it a whole lot better than I would a T3 or anything similar, and I didn't see a need to go way up in price to a T4i.If you're still on the fence about spending a big chunk of change on a camera, just go for it.  This camera isn't a piece of technology.  It's a stack of priceless photo albums.  It's vacation pictures worthy of framing.  It's family portraits.  It's memories.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT PRODUCT", "Author": "Jonathan B", "ReviewID": "RZPCWT81L6NBS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The price was great.

The T3i took some outstanding photos on vacation (the reason why we upgraded).  The second battery was a godsend.  I really liked the range of zoom between the two lenses (18-55mm and 55-250mm).Pros:It's an 18MP DSLR -- wow, the features and quality of photos!No gap between 55 and 70mm (which was the case with some kits).Had everything we needed to get up and running, with no compatibility worries.Lenses both had image stabilization.Filters came with the kit (I always like to have something to protect the actual lens)Fluorescent filter did a great job of making indoor pics look warm.  I never would've tried it if it weren't a part of the kitSecond battery is a must if you're forgetful like me.The camera case is large enough to hold everything!Cons:The T3i doesn't support some features the later or professional models do.  Research what you want so you make an informed decision.  I wish I could set it up for more than 3 consecutive AEB photos, and with a wider exposure range.Would be nice to have the 18-200mm lens instead of 18-55/55-250mm pair, but that's not a typical kit lens of this era(meaning \"expensive\").For two lenses, it'd be best to have a second UV filter just to protect the second lens' optics2x telephoto lens was blurry.  Couldn't get pics to focus at all.  Maybe it's user error, I'm still a newbie.  I haven't tested the macro lens yet.  I'm sure a pro would ask why you'd even use a telephoto or macro lens. ;)The case for the 3 filters appeared cheap.  Makes me think the filters are cheap too (but I'm cheap, so I probably would've ended up with these anyway)The OCD in me says camera case needs more pockets/dividers to organize the components.  The one divider it came with suits our needs, though.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$705.59", "Features": "Brand New w/All Supplied Accessories\n18.0 MP CMOS sensor and DIGIC 4 Image Processor for high image quality and speed.\nImproved EOS Full HD Movie mode with manual exposure control, expanded recording with new Movie Digital zoom\n3.0-inch Vari-Angle Clear View LCD; Built-in flash; Full HD movie mode at 1920 x 1080 resolution\nCompatible with full line of Canon EF and EF-S lenses", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera w/ 18-55mm IS II & 55-250 IS II Lens Kit 32GB Package 3", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EblwKVbAL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009EEK0E4"}}
