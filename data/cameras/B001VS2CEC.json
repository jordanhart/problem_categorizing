{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Simple", "Author": "nio9", "ReviewID": "RV1WURLKVM8U4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This product functions beyond expectations. I had five sensors up & running in 30 minutes, very simple. There is a GR8 feature that I would like to point out that may or may not be mentioned in the description- the device has a \"Tamper Switch\" to protect/alert if someone tries to open the exterior plastic cover on the sensor. There is one single con preventing me from giving it 5 full stars! It is the \"HUGE\" \"MASSIVE\" Magnet Cover which simply does absolutely nothing besides restricts mounting to certain areas! However this is not a deal breaker & i'm not shooting the overall item down- but Honeywell/Ademco should slim the case down to make it more sleek, versatile & useful. Just to clarify you may find yourself cracking open the magnet side & removing the magnet from the plastic housing which is simply what I did- quick tip: I used white shrink wrap over the magnet to dress it up before I siliconed it to the window- works perfect & looks nice, with no ill operating effect at all!!!! I hope I am sending out helpful info, good luck! p.s. I love, love, love Honeywell security products!!!!!!", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great, looks great. A little expensive.", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R2ABFEYGIUFMFW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I installed these on my vinyl double-hung windows for use with my Honeywell 20p with 6160rf keypad. If you put the sensor/transmitter at the top of the bottom sash, and the magnet at the bottom of the top sash, you can protect a double-hung window with just one sensor. But because of the tiny 3/16\" clearance between the sashes on my windows, there is no room for the provided magnet. I thought I was going to have to use two sensors per window, costing me hundreds of extra dollars. But after some searching I found a solution: I found some 1/2\"x2\"x1/8\" rare-earth magnets here on Amazon, and I silicon glued them directly to the glass on the upper sashes. It looks good and is working great.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT", "Author": "AliSun", "ReviewID": "R2GE9KIZOED193", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As with the whole unit and all the extra's this works amazing!
