Skip the Dock, though.", "Author": "\"pnorrod\"", "ReviewID": "R2COAPLIDRN2ZF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The DX4330 is my first digital camera and I am very pleased.  It really is easy and fun to use.  The 3X optical zoom is a very nice feature and the image quality is excellent.It is really nice to pick out the pictures you like, edit them (the free Kodak editing software is very good) and print them.  If you want to do fancy stuff such as add text to the pictures, you will have to use a more powerful editor such as PaintShop Pro or Photoshop Elements.  Instead of printing mine, however, I uploaded them to [local store] for $$$ per 4X6 or $$$ per 5X7.  The results were great!I bought the DX4330 bundled with the Easy Share Dock.  Now that I see what the Dock is all about, I would not recommend others buy it.  It gives you the dock and a NiMH \"Battery Pack.\"  The camera snaps into the dock and it will charge the battery while it is connected.  The USB connection from the dock allows you to transfer your files to you PC also.Here is the rub, however:  The dock will ONLY charge the special Kodak NIMH \"battery pack\" - if you have other NIMH batteries in the camera, it will not charge them.  I think the shape of the plastic shroud on the kodak batttery pack trips a switch inside the camera to tell it that the pack is in there.As to uploading pictures - you don't need the dock.  You can just as easily plug the camera itself into the PC via the USB cable.  Windows sees it as just another hard drive and you can drag and drop you pictures to where you want them.Instead of buying the dock, I would recommend the following:1.) Buy a nice Maha charger and some Powerex 1800 NiMH AA batteries - This will solve your battery problems.2.) Buy a 128MB SanDisk SD card for less than $$$ (they keep getting cheaper).  This will let you store about 100 highest quality photos in your camera instead of about 16 with the internal memory.3.) Buy a cheap SD USB card reader - I bought a PNY model for $$$.  This lets you take the SD card out of the camera and pop it into the card reader to load into your PC - you won't have to connect the camera at all!Hope this helps!", "Date": "January 4, 2003"}, {"Title": "Kodak 4330", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1NQENIRVN6R6U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is an excellent value for those on a budget looking for quality and ease of use.  The camera is the easiest camera I have ever used and is for the most part just point and click.  The dial settings for macro, action and night shots work very well.  The quality of the pictures are extremely good.  The only thing I would recommend is additional memory for the camera.  I purchased an additional 64 mb which will hold 50 pictures at the highest resolution.  It does consume batteries as any digital camera does, but I have found that the Kodak CRV3 and the Kodak rechargeables last the longest.  I keep a couple of the CRV3 and 2 extra rechargeables in my camera bag as backup.  The dock is a good option for transferring the pictures and for recharging (only works with the Kodak rechargeable battery pack), but I purchased an additional Kodak recharger and that works well for me.  The Easyshare software that is included is good for organizing photos.  Its option to upload pictures to several different photo developing sites is one that I have used for high quality photo prints.  Overall I would highly recommend this camera to novice as well as experienced camera users as a good solid performer for those who don't need all the bells and whistles for low to medium usage.", "Date": "December 4, 2002"}, {"Title": "great camera, fair software", "Author": "Buffalo Gal \"ebtabor\"", "ReviewID": "R1CVFFHVDPP309", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a simple camera that does a lot.  It's lightweight, takes pretty good pictures, has excellent storage and battery life.  I have had a lot of trouble with the software; sometimes it won't download, or it will take several tries until the pictures download.  This can be frustrating.  Kodak has been helpful and concerned but has not been able to do much about this.  Some cautions/advice: you do NOT need the docking cradle unless you really like rechargeable batteries.  The cradle takes up room and is no easier than the USB cable, in my opinion.  Also, you should ONLY take pictures in the \"Highest Quality\" setting; anything less can be grainy.  The camera cannot focus on moving objects, and the flash is only useful in quite close shots; for others in even soft light, it's best to set the camera on \"night\" or \"landscape,\" as another reviewer also advised.  Red-eye is chronic and the software has been of limited utility in correcting  them (and my son has bright blue eyes, which end up devilishly red every time). The memory cards are invaluable.  Get as much as you can on one card; there's no reason to get less than 128MB.  I took 175 pix on 2-64MB cards but was always worried about losing the full card.  The travel kit is very useful: I used the case as a purse while traveling (with the camera nestled inside) and it comes with all kinds of adapters that travelers need.  However, battery life is looooong: on a two week vacation on which I took 175 pix, I only used two (non-rechargeable) batteries.  Otherwise, the travel case is kind of big, so a smaller case would be useful and they are easy to find.  I bought a smaller case direct from Kodak.Summary: great camera, great value, fussy software, excellent customer service, excellent accessories, skip the docking cradle.", "Date": "May 15, 2003"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT for its price, excellent night shot mode too", "Author": "nikhila_bh...", "ReviewID": "R36SO4WLW252HO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is just fantastic!!

Walker \"I cannot live without books.\"", "ReviewID": "R3AIXGZLNO5ECK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this camera yesterday after shopping for a number of weeks, and I can't help but like it. The dial that  turns the camera on, to video mode, and to various focus-lengths contributes to making the DX4330 one of the easiest to use gizmos I have ever seen. There's even a sport/fast-motion mode, accessible from the same dial. The pictures seem nice and sharp, and the zoom works really well. There's even a flat space on the back for putting your thumb! It \"just fits\" in my hand, while still being small enough to cart around.I haven't used the software, since I'm on a Mac using iPhoto, but I can tell you it works just fine with that. This also means I haven't used the \"Share\" button to its fullest extent.This camera even has an orientation sensor, so if you take a picture turned 90-degrees, it appears right-side up in the camera screen and in iPhoto. A small feature, yes, but this camera is full of such small features. I'm really impressed with the amount of thought that went in to making it not just a usable camera, but also an enjoyable camera to use.It just works, and it works well. I'm looking forward to using this for a long time. My only regret is that I didn't buy the docking station, as well.

Because we weren't sure of the capacity, we also got three 64MB cards and a charger to go with it.  Each card held over 70 pictures on Best quality, so we had more than enough room.  We also ended up taking some short videos that did not seem to deplete the memory very much.The camera takes excellent pictures in a wide range of lighting.  We found that if a picture came out too dark or if the camera adjusted the exposure based on the wrong subject, we could just switch from the Auto setting to Night or Landscape and get a great picture.  Of course, the big advantage of the digital aspect is that you know the results of a bad picture immediately instead of after getting home.  Retake the photo and delete the bad take.We also bought the travel bag, which is too big to actually carry around, but worked OK for packing.  It came with a charger and a spare battery pack, which I highly recommend.  If you use Live View on the camera, the batteries will drain quickly.  You can also drain them by sitting and looking at your pictures for long periods of time.  It's handy to have the charger back in the hotel room getting another battery pack ready for the next day.  With heavy use, which we did, the battery lasted all day.  However, we opted not to use the Live View.  We didn't want to get to an island or somewhere nice and have a dead battery.The software that Kodak provides is excellent for creating albums, slide shows, and getting prints.  Full screen, the photos are clear with excellent color.If we had it to do all over again, we would have bought this camera a long time ago.

It was that easy. But, don't let the simplicity of use fool you this camera takes great pictures. I have used it in daylight and low light situations with really good results.  I have blown some of the pictures up to 8' X 10' with very little loss in sharpness or color.  The docking station is a must because not only does it charge your battery but with the touch of one button it automatically transfers your pictures to the computer via USB.The camera comes with a Internal Memory card but it is only good for about 10 pictures so it would be wise to purchase a 64mb card or greater depending on use.The LCD display is large enough to see what your taking pictures of but in low light situations you would do better looking through the view finder.The software that Kodak gives you is adequate but to do more editing and special effects Photoshop is the program to use.The camera is good to the feel and is pretty well made except for the Lens cap, which keeps coming off all the time.For someone looking for a really good 3mp camera for a moderate price, this is the one.", "Date": "February 26, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - Just What I Hoped For", "Author": "Jon Wilkins", "ReviewID": "R1D3YKCTOPVQ92", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was my first digital camera purchase.  I've found it to be one of the better purchases I've made.  The quality of the prints I've received has been great (with the exception noted below), and the movie feature is fun too.  A word to the wise, if you get you picture developed from this camera (8x10 and below), and you can see pixels in the picture, you should upload one of the pictures to Ofoto for comparison.  I took 26 pictures on disk to my local Target for development and was sorely disappointed at the quality of them.  I uploaded the same pictures to Ofoto, and four days later I got back perfect (35mm quality) pictures.The movie quality isn't great, but it is fun to capture perfect voices along with slightly blurred video to store on disk for eternity.  I picked up a 256mb SD card for the camera, which I can store 200+ top quality pictures and/or 30 minutes video on for < $50.My only problem now is what to do with the three 35mm cameras in my cabinet.  No more wasted film ,or duplicates of pictures with peoples eyes closed for me.  My only gripe is the cheapo lens cover, it comes off all the time.

Heck of a change from my 6 year old Casio QV-100.  Extremely easy to use and images are super sharp up to 8X10 at max resolution...to be expected with a 3.1 MP camera.  Great at the midrange setting also.  Opt for the largest SD memory card you can afford as you will be firing off pics one after the other. A 64MB SD card will save just a little over 4 minutes of reasonably good quality video. A dock, which simplifies image transfer and recharges the battery ([$$]), is not necessary unless you are a novice and/or are really into convenience. The camera comes with a USB cable for connection to a PC and you can purchase an additional battery and a charger from Kodak for a lot less.  Kodak's Easyshare (included)software is a no brainer and will work fine transferring the images into your PC. It also has good image editing/viewing capabilities. It will save the transferred images to it's own folder (no choice), requiring you to move/copy them if desired.

After browsing through the user manual & playing with the camera a bit the first night, I quickly had the key functions figured out.  This camera is very easy to use...the function dials & buttons are clearly marked & easy to figure out.  I did struggle to get some clear shots of close-up items at first, however once you figure out how to auto-focus before snapping your picture (simply press the shutter button down halfway to focus then press all the way to snap the picture) everything comes out crystal clear.  The process of uploading images from the camera to the computer is simple, & the functions in the photo program that allow you to manipulate the images (crop, reduce red-eye, rotate, etc.) are easy to use.In addition to the camera being easy to operate, I was excited to see that the quality of the photos taken with it are excellent! I have had several friends tell me how impressed they were with the picture quality when I e-mailed them some of my first few pictures.  So far I have not purchased the docking station, a memory card or any other accessories for my camera - only rechargeable batteries.  I have found that I can take over 30 pictures using the internal camera memory before it is full & has to be uploaded to the computer so more pictures can be taken.  I plan to buy a memory card eventually because 30 pictures won't get me far when I'm on vacation & am unable to upload the pictures off of the camera, but for now it works great for home use.Excellent digital camera - I would definitely recommend it!

I will be using it with a Macintosh, and was nervous as to it's integretation with Apple's iPhoto and iMovie.The camera works flawlessly, and with Apple's built in software you barely need Kodak's bundle.  Just plug in the camera with the supplied USB cable (I plug it directly to the extra port on my keyboard), turn it on and iPhoto and (Kodak's) Easy Share Photo automatically launch.Downloading images to iPhoto is straight foward, but you need the Easy Share software to download movies (automatically downloads them to your 'Movies' folder in OSX).I have already burned a 'test' DVD with the movies that I've recorded.  Quality is good considering it's not a camcorder.  And I can't say how easy it is (just open movie in QT, export it to DV Stream then import into iMovie).The photo quality is great, and colors/saturation is awesome, most of my test shots were taken in a cocktail lounge, and the background looks good (not compleatly black), very important since not all of my pictures will be in bright sunlight...  All in all a very strong preformer.The things that I didn't like are,*  There are only 3 quality settings, all of which are in JPEG format - I would have prefered an uncompressed setting for day to day (when I'm close to the computer and don't need to get 160 shots on the card).*  To get good lowlight shots (even with flash) the camera uses a very slow shutter speed - you have to hold the camera a lot more carefully than I would have thought (takes some practice with that), I guess not a bad trade off if you're aware of it.*  The Microphone picks up a lot of 'Camera Noise', if you change your grip a little (or when pressing the button to record), that will be the loudest noise in the recording.

After reading so many reviews (and going to different shops like Best Buy to check out the cameras) I decided on this one. I was definitely not disappointed. Here are the main pros and cons:Pros:1) The 3.1M pixel resolution is more than adequate for a 5 x 7 (which is what my wife loves to print). We ordered prints from ofoto.com and they were superb! (seemed even better than prints from a 35mm).2) The movie feature is also nice - it's done at a fixed low resolution and the output is in a quicktime movie format (.mov).Cons:1) The main drawback is the fact that you need to buy a separate battery charger. There are cheap ones available or you could get the relatively expensive Kodak camera dock like I did. The dock is convenient for charging and downloading images to the computer, bit I still think it's too expensive.2) You also need to get rechargeable batteries since the ones that come with the camera are not rechargeable.So overall, the camera is great, but you do have to factor in additional accessories like the rechargeable batteries and battery charger.

I was going to buy adobe photoshop 2.0 to edit video but from what I understand adobe photoshop 2.0 is not compatible with the video from this camera.

Actually, I meant WE love it! I bought it from Dell.com and used a number of stackable coupons plus free shipping. The final price we paid was $...! What's even greater is that it came with the Camera Dock II. So I think I got a pretty good deal, especially since every other local retail store was selling it for $... and $... additional for the camera dock, not to mention the tax. So we saved over $...PROS: Great outdoor vivid colors, Resolution helps make fantastic 10 x 13 prints and perhaps a bit larger, Capable of making low resolution live captures for emailing only, Dock makes transferring images from camera to computer a snap, Dock also recharges batteries. Camera has expandable accessories (sold separately) including a digital smart card, wide angle, telephoto and close up lens. I have not used a lens yet but plan to get a close up lens to shoot my coin and baseball card collection. We plan to purchase a memory card also, but honestly, you don't need one. It can take up to 38 images with its internal memory. CONS: Low illumination shots require a virtually motionless hand or using a tripod. Otherwise the images are not great and look slightly blurry. I use a tripod for this environment and the images are sharp.OVERALL: This is a great camera, especially for the price I paid. Shop around and you too can get a great deal.

I've found that the cams with bigger screens used up batteries to fast, and those with smaller screens just weren't big enough to see.  This camera has INTERNAL MEMORY.  A big plus because many digital cameras only rely on memory cards.  Also, you have the option of using SD memory cards if you want.  They're cheaper than SONY memory stick, more compact that Compact Flash cards, and are so versitile because it's the same size that fits into PDA's such as palm-pilots.  This makes it especially handy.  The flash is easy to use on this camera and isn't overpowerful like my last camera.  It's bright enough without drowning out the image with white flash.Only drawback is that the Dock is usually sold seperately.

I have printed like 100 pictures (using an online service) and the quality of the printed pictures is even better than a film camera.The only issue I've found in this model is that in the night, there's a green led next to the viewfinder which makes visibility through the viewfinder very hard.  Sometimes you have to take pictures using a good sense of positioning because the viewfinder will be completely unhelpful.Another drawback in this model is the self-timer.

Very easy to use. I am happy that I have not purchased the docking station. According to Kodak, by pressing a button on the docking station you can transfer your pictures to your computer. What I feel is that if you are too lazy to press that damn button on the docking station, just don't buy the docking station. After installing the software just connect your camera to your computer using the USB cable --- the software will automatically sense the camera and you can transfer all your pictures with a mouse-click! As far as charging the battery goes, I guess that you are better of using the non-rechargable CRV3 lithium battery (you will get one of this with the new camera). Just buy a few of them in advance from discount stores --- if you buy them at tourist spots, you can end up paying a lot more. The lithium battery has much longer life, and I don't think that you should worry about how docking station can help you recharge. One more tip --- register your camera and software to extend the standard 12 month warranty to 13 months! I have bought it a month back and paid $$$ + sales tax for the new camera. This price beats what Circuit City or Best Buy offers. Shop online from reliable stores or check out smaller dealers willing to offer a nicer deal. 3 Mega Pixels, 3x optical zoom, user-friendliness, low price and the Kodak connection --- you will surely be happy with this camera!!!

Some people report when turning on their DX4330, it hangs and shuts off. This is generally due to a bunch of dirt and grit being jammed down the focus mechanism on the lens. I find blowing it out, or minimal cleaning it out can fix this problem quickly.Only other issue so far, when connecting the camera to a computer with the USB cable, it sometimes errors out or does not work. I believe this is due to all the stress placed on the connector over the years.At this point, with the price of memory, the better alternative is just to stop using the internal memory, and pick up a 2Gb card, and card reader.

It (of course) has a 12-month warranty.  2 weeks out of warranty and it dies.  While this has been an excellent camera while functioning, it is particularly frustrating when an electronic item fails moments after its warranty period.  Kodak will not budge.  Other electronics companies that I've dealt with in the past have stepped up and responsibly honored their warranty slightly beyond norm in appreciation for customer loyalty.  So far, no luck with Kodak.  After talking to a service center, I've found that the repair is likely to cost me about $200.  Important note; the camera was never dropped or exposed to moisture. This is simply a mechanical failure.While this camera was great while it worked, my experience has me doubting that I will replace it with another Kodak.", "Date": "March 14, 2003"}, {"Title": "VERY good camera. Glad I bought it!", "Author": "MaryMary", "ReviewID": "R12YSJTLG4D70K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before I bought this camera. One thing no one seemed to talk about much, but that was a big issue for me, was shutter lag. I just hate it when I press a button and have to wait a long time before the camera takes the picture. I thought I wanted an Elph because they're so tiny, but went to different stores, and even with fresh batteries and/or no flash, the Canons and Sonys I tried took forever to take the picture. By the time 1.5 or 2 seconds has gone by, many times your shot is lost forever.But this Kodak is fast. I press the button, and it takes the picture almost immediately. If I hold the button down part-way first to let it focus, then when I press it the rest of the way it does take the picture IMMEDIATELY, even with the flash on.The picture quality is excellent, the software installed perfectly on the very first try (I use Windows 2000), and the very first time I attached the camera to its included USB cord, my computer recognized the camera and I only had to click once to get it to upload the pictures.The video quality isn't great (I knew it wouldn't be), but I love being able to carry this thing around in my purse all the time and snap either pictures or video with sound, any time I want to. I've captured some really memorable moments this way at picnics, at my son's preschool, and other places where I would never have dragged the video camera.

Also I don't like the Quicktime format for Video/Audio (*.mov) because the compression format could be better than this one. The mayor problem I have found is taking pictures at night, most of them are out of focus, or with a orange shadow around the objects, specially if it is a open wide picture.Anyway if the most part of your pictures are going to be taked on good light, don't think it twice, buy this one.", "Date": "January 6, 2003"}, {"Title": "kodak dx4330 a superb digital camera", "Author": "M.

My only negatives were that I had a bit of trouble installing the software on my MAC and had to get help from Kodak.
