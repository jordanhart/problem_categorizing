I haven't seen a camera for under $200 where you can control both aperture and shutter speed.  The flash is great - it determines how bright the flash should be so getting washed out pictures is rare and I have taken pictures across a dimly lit room and the exposure was almost perfect.The downside:  - The bag it was packaged with is a bit too big for me.  - It takes a little bit of time for the camera to process/save the pictures.  - It uses AA batteries so you need to buy rechargable NiMH batteries for the camera.Overall, a great buy for the price!", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "djp332", "ReviewID": "R3E94CWT698RXF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in anticipation of an Alaskan cruise this summer.  So far, I have taken pictures at our zoo and botanical garden, just to see how the camera works.  It is amazing.  The zoom lens is terrific!  I almost thought I was right in front of the elephants when I saw the pictures.  The camera actually knew when I was taking photos of flowers.  I could also see the craters in the moon when taking pictures of the super moon earlier this month.  I haven't had any issues with the batteries as I have been using rechargeable batteries.

Very happy with the photo quality and it is very user-friendly especially if you are not a professional photographer. The only negative comment I would have to say about the camera is the battery life. Last time I used it, I had put brand new batteries and by the end of the evening the camera was dead.

It's great for me and my wife as she like to take lots of pictures and really knows what to expect out of a camera if you want more than just a shoot-n-go. AUTO MODE is great for me as I just shoot-n-go. We went to Best Buy to look around for cameras and the prices were so high for cameras with the same features as this one. I love that you can get 45min of 720p HD video with the 8gb SD card included in the kit.I recommend this camera and really the whole kit. The kit is well worth it for $7(seller selling camera alone for $194) extra bucks despite the case being oversize. I recommend finding a soft sleeve for the camera when not in use.

I have yet to use all the features on the camera, but I am quite pleased with the results thus far. I specifically liked that this particular bundle came with an 8GB memory card. Although mine did not come with the memory card, once I contacted the seller to see when they could send one out, as I was charged for this as part of the bundle, but they were able to refund my card that I used. I was satisfied with this result since they reacted with a great sense of urgency. I recommend this camera bundle, or even just the camera to those who are new to photograghy or just want a descent camera.

The only thing I thought was a little tricky, and I guess I'm not that smart, is that on SX150 they gave the video feature it's own dedicated button on the upper back right of the camera, which I was confused by for a month or so.

You can also pick up some rechargeables for a reasonable price along with a charger on Amazon.com as well.  Great camera for a good price.  I bought my husband a black one and I have the red one.

Ease of operation key to someone who just likes to point and shoot, from bugs to birds, flowers and trees.  Just the right size to make carting it around easy but handling not so delicate.  I think Canon made this one for me.  Thrilled with the zoom capabilities and amazed at the auto focus that mysteriously knows what to focus on.  Very little reading to put it into action.  Can't truly vouch for the video or battery life since a month later, I'm still clicking furiously away with no indication that the batteries are low but I have not used the video functions.  This is a simple camera that captures my memories splendidly and all very easy on the bank account.  Thanks to Beach Camera for the perks and Amazon for the offer to allow using some vouchers up.
