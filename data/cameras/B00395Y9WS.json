{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good, but look a little higher!", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R9POU9WYW63TI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is overall pretty good and has a competitive MSRP. However, be sure to consider the older but higher-end Panasonic Lumix DMC-FP8. When Panasonic came out with the new FP1 and FP3 (the touchscreen version of the FP1), I was hoping they would be the same as the well-reviewed FP8 but with an improved look and a lens cover. Well, I was slightly disappointed.Let's forget the gimmicky touchscreen FP3 and compare the FP1 to the FP8. The FP1 is $40 cheaper than the FP8 regarding market price (as of when I wrote this review) but it has:-0.6x less zoom (4.0x rather than 4.6x)-Mega OIS rather than Power OIS (Panasonic claims Power is 2x better, maybe dubious)-No wide-angle lens (35mm rather than 28mm)-80 shots less per battery charge (300 rather than 380)-No zoom during video recordingPersonally, that last drawback breaks the deal for me as I need the best video recording experience possible (and I've found that the FP8 has THE best 720p quality in point-and-shoot cameras under $200). But it's up to you on whether those drawbacks are worth the $40 savings.", "Date": "May 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Consumer Reports Best Buy", "Author": "Blake", "ReviewID": "R33W9DB409VLH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera solely on Consumer Reports ratings.

It's a bulkier model but gets a 60x zoom, quite large for still a non-DSLR pocket camera. I liked the Lumix line by Panasonic. After playing with many ultra compact models in the store (Samsung TL205 with dual view and Samsung TL105), I decided this was the way to go! I am happy thus far. Please, let me say I am no expert, but I have had 5-6 digital cameras and can compare.The good:  zooms up to 33.8x, which is HUGE for a camera this size (the optical zoom is internal! takes up no space but quite effective)  lots of scenes and modes to choose from  super small size (0.7\" wide), smaller than my blackberry phone!  lightweight  sliding the cover down is an easy and quick power on, makes catching the 'right' moment easier when you don't have a long start up  very quick when using a SDXC card, class 4 or the higher the better  selects and determines the best scene and shot for you  speaker for playback of films is actually quite goodThe Bad:  menu and scene selection is not as easy to go through as other models, needs a clicker or round changer on the unit itself (like choosing to film a movie, you must go through menu rather than hitting a button)  quite grainy and noisy in some modes, almost unusable. just have to find right onesThe Indifferent:  the camera colors are a little funky, choose wisely  when pressing buttons, you can notice a slightly 'cheaper' feel than others (the sound, the feel, etc.)Overall it's a good, solid camera. I dont know if I would use it as my only camera because I personally like a nice, big zoom, but definitely a nice addition to the collection. Definitely great for beginners, people who take pics with friends, and casual shooting. It's no DSLR, but a good, daily pocket camera.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera", "Author": "R.

It's my first proper digital camera and I'm very happy with it. I bought it because I thought it offered the best value-for-money in the sub-$150 range. It takes 12 MP still pictures and 720p movies, and is very light and thin. I bought a 8 GB SD card to go with the camera for about $20.The picture quality is very good, and I like the way I can zoom in to the pictures on my computer and see details that initially aren't visible. When you look really close up, though, (at the pixel level) you can see the limitations of the camera, with a lack of detail and slightly odd color effects but these aren't noticeable when you zoom out. Another issue is that the image is a little distorted. E.g., if you take a picture of a straight line, the line will look a little curved in the final picture.The video quality is very good and compares favourably with my wife's Flip camera (which was more expensive!). The Panasonic has image stabilization which the Flip doesn't, but the performance in dark conditions seems a bit worse for the Panasonic.The lens has a large cover that slides up and down, and which you can just move by pushing your finger against it. This works very well, and is easier than pressing a button.Note that there is a DMC-FP3 model which is more expensive, has a touch-screen interface and takes 14 MP pictures. It was about $80 more than the FP1, and I didn't think the extra features were worth the difference.Overall I'm happy with the camera, and I recommend it to anybody else looking for a cheap camera that takes good pictures and movies.", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great point-and-shoot for the price", "Author": "J.

I chose these three based off online reviews and consumer reports.  I was very dissapointed with the canon.  It was the worst of all three.  The casio was okay but the quality of pictures didn't seem that much better than this panasonic, and it was priced about $60 more.This is the best camera I think you could find for the value.  It allows you to make several setting adjustments or just use automatic.  Either way it is a great camera. It is small, thin, light weight and takes relatively good pictures for a point and shoot.

I had been _extremely_ satisfied with my canon SD elph, but I'm rough on cameras and the elph had broken down one too many times -- the telescoping lens on the elph was the failure point, twice. I returned the canon to factory for repair but at 100 dollars a pop it was way too close to buying a new camera -- the lumix design with the lens inside the body housing seemed like a solution to me, and the reviews confirmed it. Instead the camera is such crap that I've not only lost faith in panasonic but in consumer reports as well. (To be fair to consumer reports the canon was a consumer reports recommendation that lived up to the promise).Why is this camera crap?Day 1, picture 1, I instantly saw the picture quality as a major step down from the canon. A dramatic step down -- The lens is simply not sharp, the colors are less accurate and lively. The picture quality is so unexciting that I stopped taking pictures -- I didn't even realize I'd made that choice, but I stopped taking pictures because it wasn't fun. The video is equally bad, and on top of it it is saved in the .mov format, which is NOT a friendly format for PC users... if you are a power user, or a Mac user (i think, I'm not a mac guy, but .mov is a quicktime format which I believe is mac), it won't be a big issue... if you aren't the kind of person who likes installing video codecs -- stay away.Secondly... I treated this camera gently, not wanting to repeat my canon probs... Within months it stopped autofocusing correctly... and it was hard to figure out what was wrong, it seemed like I must be doing something wrong, but it has become obvious that it is a SOFTWARE issue (when I reboot the camera with on/off -- it autofocuses correctly for one picture and then it stops focusing).A software breakdown on a point and shoot? I do not need this garbage. Truly. Crappy pictures when it worked and then it broke in less than 6 months. 1 star.I recently bought a new canon SD Elph and a nice little protective case for it!
