CHOU", "ReviewID": "R25136ANFEE5QK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Drawn to this camera for its compact size and ability to change lenses. However, its hefty price was holding me back until the recent drop.I am an amateur photographer who shoots primarily with a K5 (started out with the K1000 and K-m) and I would not compare the 2 cameras as they belong to different categories.The image quality is definitely better than Pentax's point and shoot that I've used before (ie A40 and A60). It's a fun little camera that has a lot to give for someone who wants unique shots and loves to play filters with.Image from the prime lens is very sharp, however, images from the zoom lens came out a tad soft when comparing the 2 lenses.This camera also could be used with my existing K-mount lenses with a adapter that you could get on Amazon for about $20.I have yet to experiment with other lenses, but knowing the crop factor of Q's sensor, it could be an interesting body some nice macro shots.The only complaint that I have is the shutter speed. I have to wait for about a 1.5 sec to take another shot after pressing the the shutter. Also, due to Q's tiny size, the battery life will not match up with its big brother K5's.Here are couple test shots that I posted: [...]Overall, it's a fun, lightweight interchangeable lens camera that's perfect when you don't want to carry the bulky DSLR. Also, I find my subjects (people & animals) are less intimidated when I was aiming the Q at them.", "Date": "October 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1AR3YK8SOYIYJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "IQ is excellent, especially when paired with the prime. It is a great camera and system. You can take it with 3 lenses in your pocket easily, that is just incredible.The controls are very well laid out and it is easy to use. Make sure you update the software, it makes focusing much faster and gives you focus peaking.Iso is usable up to 1600 (unless you are a pixel peeper, in which case keep it at 800 or lower, but really this camera is not for pixel peeping). WB is pretty reliable and colors are rich and accurate.Flaws? Short battery life and slow writting times when in raw. Also, you need to be a gadget lover to \"get\" this camera. I am sure there are some super-zooms out there that are way more versatile and offer equal or better IQ. But, in my mind, they don't come close as a machine and, trust me, you will get excellent photos.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wanted to love it, but...", "Author": "Kaleidocherry", "ReviewID": "RXISALRRCJ9UF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to upgrade from my Canon point-and-shoot, a 14.1 megapixel from when that size was first released.  I spent a few weeks investigating things, starting with the Nikon P510 which gets such excellent reviews, and then got intrigued by the compact system cameras.  Ultimately I ordered this Pentax because it was so cute, and because test images on the internet were crisp and clear.  (My old Canon gives me somewhat grainy images and I've never been able to figure out why.)Well, the Pentax arrived today and I spent most of the day faffing about with it, and doing side-by-side comparisons with the Canon, and there is no visible difference in image quality even magnified to 200% on the computer.  The video quality of both cameras is similar.  The only place where I'd say the Pentax excels is in its flash, which has a longer throw, and because it pops up, it can illuminate more.  Images I took with the flash look significantly brighter than they did with the Canon's built-in but non-movable flash.This could still be a good camera for someone - it's narrower but slightly longer than a playing card, so it's nice and compact - but I also discovered I really do not like the idea of interchangeable lenses, and so I am sending it back and beginning a new hunt for a point-and-shoot.  Ironically I will probably check out the P510 again.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00604YS3K"}}
