Most beat my expectations, a few did not.  The Photoamerica battery simply didn't work. I haven't tested the charger with the Nikon battery.  The Photoamerica cleaning kit went right into the trash.  The camera bag is too small for the camera and charger (this is my travel kit), but it came with a small pouch in which the Fotasy lens hood I also bought fits nicely.  The Nikon lens cloth was replaced with a generic one without a sleeve and clip.  A small inconvenience, if the camera case were bigger.  Otherwise, I love the camera!  This is my 2nd P series camera.  It has the manual controls that I prefer to use and an expansive menu of presets when I don't have the time or desire to shoot manually.  Overall, this is an excellent value and I would recommend its purchase to anyone.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00I51RTZ0"}}
