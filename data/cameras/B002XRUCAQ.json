{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera -- high quality, excellent image, great interface", "Author": "AZ76737 \"amazon76737\"", "ReviewID": "R2B0RHDIJHDVKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking for an IP camera (1) to monitor a second home and (2) for use as a high end babycam.  Unfortunately, I tried many products before ending up with this Axis product.  I have used lower priced Panasonic models, a Vivotek, and a Cisco VC220.This camera is high end.  The price is higher than some of the products I tried first.  I was willing to pay up for quality though.  I just didn't know what to buy.  Here is why I recommend it:(1) Image quality is exceptional.  Best of the cameras I've tried.(2) The lens and related technology is very good.  Sharp, high-res images day and night.  The resolution even in ultra-low lighting conditions is amazing.  Great for use as a baby camera, for example.(3) The software & web interface are excellent.  You can seemingly do everything you'd ever want.  The software works seamlessly across platforms.  Axis is a leader in this area.  There are i-phone and i-pad apps available for Axis cameras.", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002XRUCAQ"}}
