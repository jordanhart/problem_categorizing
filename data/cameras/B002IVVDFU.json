So far, I can't find anything wrong with this one!I got a Lowepro Rezo 20 case for this camera and it's perfect for my needs.  The interior is exactly the right size for the camera, and the front pouch has room for 4 spare batteries and a spare SD card.

Seriously, there were many times my daughter would only take 20 or so pictures and then the camera would refuse to turn on until we replaced the batteries.Kodak's customer repair center refuses to acknowledge the problem and insists customers purchase expensive NiMH or Lithium batteries to resolve the power problem -- even though the directions say alkaline batteries are fine!After researching this for close to a month, I've found many camera reviews AND rechargeable battery reviews that all point to this issue.  Kodak customers are reporting their cameras will only work with high-end rechargeable batteries. Some were close to throwing the camera out.  The good news is, the expensive batteries do work, but Kodak directions and packaging all indicate that alkaline batteries are fine...they even ship the cameras with alkaline batteries!This is a serious issue...most of you will purchase this camera to save money, but be prepared to spend another $15-20 for rechargeable batteries as a required add-on.Do yourself a favor and get Canon, Nikon or other higher quality brand to save yourself aggravation.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera!", "Author": "M.

Large preview screen on the back, easy modes to choose from, and video included.  It's a little bigger than some cameras, but still easily fits in a pocket.

It offers good cost-for-features value. If you are moving from a 5MP, or higher camera, it may not seem that good. The panorama stitch feature is fun to use and the shake reduction works well enough.I bought this to compare to my 5MP, Kodak Z730. The first pictures I took were in low light and were noticeably noisier than the Z730. Outdoor shots, in bright light, were not much different than the Z730.I now shoot most pictures in \"P\" mode. Using the menu, I set the camera for ISO 100, Sharpness to \"Sharp\" and Color Mode to \"High Color.\" This gives better pictures. One reason the older camera is so good, it has the f/2.8-5.6, Schneider-Kreuznach, glass lens.The 3\" LCD screen is nice, though difficult to see in bright sunlight, as most are. The buttons and menus are easy to use. If you are not used to Kodak cameras, the C182 is easy to learn. To get the most out of all of the features, download the extended user guide from kodak.comI use Sanyo Eneloop NiMH rechargeable batteries. After more than 100 pictures, the battery indicator shows about 50% left. I have \"played\" with the settings quite a bit and I upload pictures using the USB cable. This requires the camera to be turned on. It would save energy to remove the SDHC card (8GB Toshiba) and connect it directly to the computer. If a friend asked me about buying a C182, I would say yes.Updated August 8,2010: This is not a low light camera. No matter what settings I use, there is a lot of \"noise\" in pictures taken in low light. It is also difficult to get subjects in focus in low light. The exception is using the flash with subjects that are close to the camera. Switching to \"Blur Reduction\" mode, puts the camera back to automatic for ISO, shutter speed, etc. Using a tripod would probably resolve these issues. \"P\" mode is Program mode. All modes are accessed by the Mode dial on the top right of the camera.

We mainly bought the C182 because it was on sale for a ridiculously low price... but I have to tell you, I am very impressed with this camera.The Kodak is super easy to operate and takes excellent pictures in most normal situations. The video quality is better than expected as well. If it lags at all it is in low-light conditions, but even then it is much better than I would expect from a sub one hundred dollar camera.The best feature of the Kodak is the screen. It has a very large looking 3\" screen that is exceptionally smooth and vibrant. It is a great screen for passing around and sharing with friends and family. Screen visibility in daylight is actually not bad.So far we have had no problems with this camera, though we really haven't had it long enough to judge durability.  Build quality seems decent; good for this price range.Conclusion:  I have a two year old Canon Powershot that I use as a backup/convenience camera to my DSLR. I love that anyone in the family can operate it and that it takes very good pictures in a wide variety of situations.  But I have to say that so far, the much cheaper C182 has performed almost as well as my Powershot, and definitely better than the Samsung it replaced. I have bought and used several cameras  in the around $100 price range (including Canon, Sanyo, Nikon, Samsung, Fuji, Olympus) and so far this is by far the best value.PROS:  Ease of use, Good Photo Quality, Nice Video, Beautiful Big Screen (really love that screen), Great value.CONS: Low-light only okay, Battery Hog", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "good camera", "Author": "Doc", "ReviewID": "R2AGX7G1XMD0NZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my camera for approx. 2 months and I think it's a great buy.

The movie mode is low resolution, which I expected for a camera at this price, but playback has no sound when viewed on the camera.

The first, which I'm still using, is a C340 Easy Share.  While the C182 has more features and Picture quality is great, Kodak Engineers must have been drinking heavily when they designed this one.  The left out important features.  For example the ability to automatically have a Date Stamp on Pictures.  My old camera once you set it to place a Date on each picture that's it.  You don't have to change it and every picture will have a date on it until you turn this feature off.  With the C182 you have to manually insert the date on each picture.  So if you take 500 pictures you have to do this 500 times....How stupid is this.My old C340 was able to retain the date on the camera even though it had no batteries for weeks and even months.  With this new C182 once the batteries are out for a short period of time you have to set the date and time again.  Foolish if you ask me.The pictures are great but so are other cameras.

This is the second one, really because 2 days before the extended warranty expired the door to the battery compartment popped off its hinges.  Brought it back to Best Buy that day and the Goonie Squad stood then and looked at the two pieces, looked at each other, looked down at the camera again, looked at each other and then both slowly turned their heads towards me as if it were some kind of sychronized SNL skit.  They said that they would have to send the camera to the larger Goon Headquarters where they repair cameras and it would be back in two days.  a week goes by and not a peep so I go back down to Best Buy and demand my camera, a replacement or a refund.  There happened to be one of the same camera in stock and so they traded with me and I purchased the extended warranty once again.  That was three years ago so this unit is no longer under warranty and about 6 months again the very same flaw occurred.  Now that I understand cameras and design a little better it is clear to see that the constant opening and closing of the battery compartment door to change batteries or disc is not supported by the.hinge which is where the plastic is the least wide,  The break occurs directly in line with the metal molding that is embedded in the door. Surely the designers at Kodak must have seen it if I could discern the weakness.  This leads me to believe that the executive board and marketing told production to move forward with this particular model so as to have it in place for the holiday season before all the kinks could be worked out.It makes me wonder how many other products has the developers and production team been forced to push through before the product was ready for consumers.  I see this happening more often than not and it seems to be the trend in competition.  Kind of like the Ford Pinto and Chevy Vega race to be the auto manufacturing to be first in launching their solution to the foreign imports that cost countless lives due to the faulty valve between the rear gas tank and the connection to the frame of the car..", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worth every bit of the purchase price and more.", "Author": "Naybo", "ReviewID": "R2SKGJSTGI6Z5K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my camera.

The 12.0 megapixel has little to do with picture quality- but more to do with picture size. The screen on the computer usually puts the pictures at 4000x3000. Thats fine, but sometimes the pictures come out a tad blurry or watery. Then again- this is a digital camera, and not a 35 mm.

It drove me absolutely wild while I was trying to download pictures from the camera to computer for the first time.  It took MANY hours to get it working.  But I finally did.So for a summer 2011 trip, I bought two more Kodaks, one for me, one for my daughter.  Since I got the EasyShare software working, and when it works it really is pretty nice, I hoped to use the Easy Share software to make it easy to manage all three of our pictues together.  It hasn't worked out that way.I have spent MANY hours so far getting the computer and these two cameras to talk to each other.  They won't.  I have fought for hours with the software, trying to submit a trouble report on Kodak's web site that insists that I enter the camera model number but has no line entry for entering that model number so won't take my report, dealing with the email/chat support folks who don't read the emails and respond to questions I didn't ask, who barely understand English...  The software is completely rinky-dink, as if it were a favor that the neighbor's teenage kid did on a Sunday afternoon, not a professional, robust, smooth, \"it just works\" commercial grade product.  Kodak's manual is absolutely pathetic, there are no meaningful instructions (the total extent of the instructions for transferring pictures is SIXTEEN WORDS -- no help at all if things don't work), and there are no trouble shooting instructions.  And I'm a pretty smart guy--a master's in computer engineering from one of the best engineering schools, gave invited lectures at MIT on computer science, etc -- if the software for this camera is giving me trouble, well, I don't know what Kodak expects everyone else to do.)I have just plain given up.  My Panasonic, which is a full-feature semi-professional model, FAR more complicated, is far simpler to use.  It just works -- plug it in, and everything just worked like it was supposed to.  I finally just took the memory card out of the Kodak, put it in the Panasonic, and transferred the pictures that way.I am as big a fan of \"buy American\" as anyone, but this is the end of the line for Kodak and me.

I have a 256 MB SD card which holds well over 200 photos.  I usually take the SD card to the local CVS and insert it into the Kodak photo kiosk and print my photos or I can insert the card into my computer and print images.

It got broken in an unfortunate accident, and when the time came to purchase a brand new digital camera, I chose the exact same camera! Despite being the kind of camera that has a lithium battery included, this one comes with 2 double A batteries, which is inconvenient at first, but not if you invest in some rechargeable double A batteries and a charger for cheap at a pharmacy or electronic store. It has great resolution, it's incredibly \"easy\" to use as its title suggests, it's inexpensive, and the photos it takes are really high quality! The camera itself has a lot of features, such as letting you crop, or rotate your pics and it takes great videos too! It doesn't have a built in speaker, though, but it's sound quality is great too. And another thing I love about this camera is that there is no software you have to \"pre-install\" on your computer in order to use it. You just plug it in, import the photos onto your hard drive, and you're set!

She loves pictures, but everyone always sends her prints and she isn't able to display them!! They just sit in boxes in her closet. I had once mentioned to her that she should get a digital camera, but she was very scared to use one.. she thought she would never understand it. I had been reseraching many different cameras to buy her. I wanted to make sure that a) it was extremely simple to use, b) the buttons were big, easy to see, and not complicated, c) the picture quality was pretty decent, d) the camera used AA batteries (so if the batteries died, she could replace them easily instead of having to recharge a rechargable battery when on vacation), and e) the camera was easy to hold, reducing the chances of dropping it, and not super small so that she wouldn't loose it.  This camera is just that!!! She LOVES IT! Now, she is able to easily, with confidence, take stunning pictures with no problem! Compared to my Cannon SD1300IS, I'm actually quite impressed. The pictures she takes have vivid colors, and are very crisp. :) The camera uses an SD card and i just purchased and 8in. Kodak EasyShare digital photo frame for her for christmas so that she can display her pictures without any problems. The only con that I have for this camera is that it eats batteries.

I love this camera, it fits well in my pocket, and it does well on batteries despite what others might say, most consumer grade cameras of this type consume lots of battery power very quickly anyways.  (One helpful thing is to not turn the camera on or off two frequently than you need to.  It drains the battery more turning it on and off then just leaving it on for a minute to take your next picture.)  Also some people like to use rechargeable batteries on these, I don't.  I think rechargeable batteries can be undependable at times, and lose their strength after little use.  I like the cheap alkaline, you can buy more of them cheaply and get just as much use out of them as some descent rechargeable units.  (but that's just my observation, it's your camera if you buy it, do whatever makes your usage enjoyable) I love the big LCD screen, it makes picture taking much more enjoyable.

When I purchased this model it was a newer model than hers so I thought that it would be upgraded with speakers. I was wrong. It takes decent pictures and is easy to use but the other part totally makes it suck. Why should the camera be capable of recording videos if it's not capable of recording sound? Kodak dropped the ball on this one. With this being said I paid $85 on amazon.com, way too much if you ask me, and today Oct 8, 2011 I see it's selling for $125.00, I wouldn't dare pay that much. There are much better cameras at lower prices.EDITING REVIEW: Other customers have told me that the C182 does have sound, just not during playback on the camera. This to me still makes little sense, but I do like the camera and if I find this to be true...since I'm at work I can't check that--but I'm have the faith--then I apologize to Kodak for getting a little angry! Hope that makes everyone happy!

It was the first digital camera I have ever owned. I buy from Amazon all the time, and have received great products. However, upon receiving this camera, it became immediately apparent that I would soon regret it. From the first use the camera would make a low running sound when it was powered on. The lens would zoom out as it should, but the LCD screen would go blank, like the camera was off, but the lens would still be zoomed out. The camera would do this intermittently. After only owning the camera for 2 months, it quit working on me all together. No matter how many batteries I tried, it would not even power on. Once I contacted customer service at amazon, I found the return process very simple and I received a refund quickly. This has, unfortunately, discouraged me from purchasing any electronics online.

Actually, the only item I had expected to buy would have been a camera case which, of course, this item also did not come with.
