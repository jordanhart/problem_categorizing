{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Product!", "Author": "P. D.", "ReviewID": "R13XGWRPZ9OOZ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have this installed in our house, and it has worked flawlessly! With the 1TB hard drive you can record up to 667 hours of video, and it records in D1 resolution! (that's 480 lines of resolution which is more than the 240 of the comparably-priced products) We've already caught next door neighbor's car getting burglarized, and another neighbor down the street having his rims stolen! We haven't had any problems, and I bet it's because the thieves see the cameras, and decide to go somewhere else. The part they don't get is that a couple of the cameras catch activity down the street too. I did replace one of the cameras but that's because I wanted much more distance in the night vision in that one, and because the cameras use BNC connectors with standard power plugs, it was a breeze. Just great product overall!", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "security system Zomodo", "Author": "Virgil", "ReviewID": "R2N20QRXXV9I37", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been setting up the zomodo system and so far everything is just as advertised.  I think it will work perfect for my needs.The picture quality is great and the ease of plug and play as well as affordability is wonderful!The programming of the DVR is not as easy as advertised, I am slowly getting it but it is not an easy task.  A lot of it is trial and error, the manual is not all that helpful, seeming to skip huge parts of what to do to make the system functional.The zomodo website, (zomodoknowedgebase.com), is better and more helpful then the manual.  Like all software systems it takes awhile to know all the ins and outs of them.  If you are patient and don't mind discovering things on your own with occassional clues from the zomodo co. this is the system for you.  I fully expect my system to work to its full potential once I figure out the settings and software.  It would be helpful if the company had customers sharing their struggles, in a FAQ kind of setup, (like most computer games), in leiu of adeqate instructions, getting help from others who have \"gone before\" is nice.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0055WE01S"}}
