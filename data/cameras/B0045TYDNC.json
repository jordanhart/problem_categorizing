{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Cheaper and better than the Nikon LF-1", "Author": "Shane O. Laake \"camera nerd\"", "ReviewID": "R3K2ZW9AZJP00H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon quietly replaced the LF-1 with this cap, the LF-4.  Nothing Earth shattering, but the new cap is easier to grip and has a larger flange to press against the lens' mount as well as any weather sealing.  Both are nice improvements, and like the LF-1 (and unlike many knock-offs), this cap easily and securely mounts no matter how rotated.  So cheaper, better (just barely), and likely soon all that will be, that's what you get.  Perhaps the lower cost is due to the LF-1 being made in Japan while this is made in Thailand, but since Nikon sees fit to make millions of DSLRs and lenses in Thailand (not to mention that Japan has lots of other stuff to worry about), that's not so much as issue as an observation.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better Seal, Easier \"On/Off's\"", "Author": "D. Baumwald", "ReviewID": "R1KC8PH5J0ZWTE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After I purchased the relatively new 55-300mm lens, I noticed that it shipped with a different rear cap than any other lens I have purchased.  This was the LF-4 cap.  After making note of this, I began paying attention to the practical differences between the LF-4 and the original LF-1.First, the LF-4 is much easier to grip than the LF-1.  The two differences are the thicker and longer ribs and the matted finish of the plastic on the exterior.  Both of these combine for easier \"on-and-off's\" during lens changes, especially if your hands are somewhat damp, for whatever reason.Secondly, the LF-4 has a flange that increases the coverage for the rear of the lens body.  This certainly seems to provide more of a weather-tight seal, exposing less aluminum to the environment.  As for the precision of the fit between the lens and the LF-4, this seems equal to the LF-1.  However, with the improved grip, it is possible to tighten it down more to the lens body, especially since removal is easier.One more thing.  To me, the LF-4 seems like it would have more \"give\" during an impact than the original LF-1, due to the type of plastic used for its construction. This is strictly opinion based on feel alone, and it may be an illusion only.After using both caps for some time, on various lenses, I believe I will be replacing all of my LF-1's with the newer LF-4's.  This cap may not be for everyone, or every lens for that matter.  However, for me, the added \"sense\" of security is enough to make the switch.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nikon LF-4: New evolutionary essential for every Nikkor Lens", "Author": "John Williamson", "ReviewID": "R2GQDOYU11492B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As camera owners, we all go crazy at times, finding ways to protect the front element of our lenses by purchasing filters, lens cleaners, lens hoods and such. Yet what is forgotten so often is that it's the crucial rear lens element that the light passes through just before it reaches the sensors on our cameras.If you own a Nikon DSLR, regardless of which model it is, then the Nikon LF-4 Rear Lens Cap should be considered as an essential for good lens storage and protection. These are made from hard plastic, and they will protect that critical rear element on your Nikkor lens from smudges, scratches and dust. This is the right rear lens cap for all Nikkor lenses for DSLRs and will fit almost every Nikon F-mount lens ever made, and that also includes teleconverters.The first time that I attended the old traveling Nikon School in the '70s, one of the instructors was the late Sterling Clark, who was not only teaching the course, but was an avid Nikon 35 mm shooter with a background in sports photojournalism. He carefully explained why it was essential to protect the rear element more than the front by showing 35mm slides (back in the day), showing first slides with a big thumbprint on the front of the lens and the same on the rear. Next came identical images shot with Kodachrome, with the results. It was clear to all that the often overlooked rear element was the one that needed to be protected the most.So what's the difference between Nikon's LF-1 Rear Lens Cap and the new LF-4 Rear Lens Cap? Not much, according to Nikon. The LF-4 is a newer version with a slightly different and easier to grip design. Call it product evolution.The Nikon LF-4 Rear Lens Cap costs less than a low-end filter, so the investment to protect the back element from debris is quite reasonable. In this age of where 'new and improved' products often cost more then their predecessors, it's good to see that this new  LF-4 Rear Lens Cap actually costs less than the one that it has replaced.9/20/2012", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fits my Nikon Lens Perfectly!", "Author": "Jessica Ojeda \"Jessica Ojeda\"", "ReviewID": "R2V6OSKPPT134S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like the matte black finish and how the cap twists on and sort of \"locks\" in place.

I sold my Vespa moped (a bad wipe out on a wet street made me loose interest) and used the money to by the EM with a 50 mm. I added zoom lenses over the years and upgraded to an FMII. Basically, this injection molded lens cap has remained the same since the 70s.But, it actually could use some serious rethinking/redesign. Sure, the way it attaches must stay the same (the mounts do not change). But the small mark that tells you how to place it on the lens can be very hard to see. I would rather see it white or yellow and very visible. Just that simple measure would be a big improvement. I am sure an industrial designer could make the grip on it better too (they tend to pop out of hands unexpectedly). Also, for the insanely high price Nikon charges, at the very least, they could spend the extra .01 cents to make the arrow/alignment mark bigger and more visible to help users.Actually, it could be improved for mounting. It could LOCK on the lens so it does not fall off. User presses a small button to remove it from lens.BTW: that FMII was great and worked for years. But after one time on a copy stand, where I spent $200 on film and processing, all the images were blank! I sent it to Nikon and it turns out, the early FMII shutters go BAD. Normally, Nikon would replace it. But they no longer had any. (I wish I had known. I would have sent it in ASAP for replacement 10 years earlier.) In a panic, I bought a refurbed N80 from Nikon. But they would only sell it to me IF they kept the FMII! Ugh, I was desperate.
