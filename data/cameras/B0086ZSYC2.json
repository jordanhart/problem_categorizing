{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love it. Only camera you need for a trip.", "Author": "Gator", "ReviewID": "R359VTDWCCISBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a Christmas present for our son. He actually found it, with a 18-135 WR lens. (A 18-55 WR kit lens should be ok in general since we rarely used large zooms, but it's good to have).We just came back from a 10-day Hawaii trip. This camera took 90%+ of all our photos. We are very happy with the photo quality, bright, vibrant and sharp. The best feature: the camera and lens package is weather and cold resistant. We took it everywhere we went, watching sunrise on Haleakala, going to beaches, hiking and biking, or just sit around a pool, no matter rain, shine, or fog.And I don't have to carry it :)We love it. You will love it too.ps. A minor issue: the lens hood is not secure when put on backward when not in use (which is commonly practiced, especially when you use flash). It would otherwise be perfect (but no points deducted here).", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0086ZSYC2"}}
