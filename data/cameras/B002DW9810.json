Image quality seems to have improved over time and the handy size make it a keeper.  It is not a megacam in the Nikon or Canon class but it is an eccentric little camera that has provided me quite a bit of fun.This camera and its predecessors has an avid following on flickr and you can see quite a few examples there at:[...]", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Meh", "Author": "Travis Juntara \"Frug-O-taku\"", "ReviewID": "R3MKOLGHQPDJJ0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Insane battery consumption. Very inconsistent results mainly due to shutter lag. Camera has a habit of slowing down to around 1/5 and 1/20 shutter speeds, this requires alot of stillness. No \"lomo\" feel like with the Japan versions, maybe due to different firmware.Using an expensive energizer e2 lithium or sanyo eneloop seems to do wonders for this camera. Fold out mechanism is nifty, but the viewfinder means that you need to wait for a beep to know when your picture is taken. It can be awkward just standing there and waiting because I don't know exactly when it would take the picture.Rolling shutter effect throws alot of my hastily taken pictures off, but the good pictures are definitely good. Would not recommend it since unless your cellphone camera is horrible like mine. Even then you'd be better off with a point and shoot from kodak or GE, maybe even vivitar.Specs: 1/3 cmos, 1.3 megapixel default, 49mm (35mm equivalent), Regular SD card reader, burstmode and self-timer, 1/5 through around 1/200 shutter speeds on a f/2.8 lens.

Garbage.  Worthless.  This is a waste of earth's natural resources.  The camera ceased to function after taking six pictures.  Every battery I inserted after the first registered as having no power by this thing.  I purchased an SD card also and the camera refused to recognize it after the sixth picture.  The item was purchased to photograph merchandising displays for a marketing survey project.  I just wanted some simple pictures, not something worthy of submission to a museum of fine art.  Since I no longer have the packaging it can't be returned to Amascam.com for a refund.  The only things I'll every buy again from the site are books.  Unfortunately, it is not heavy enough for a door stop and is too thick to be a bookmark.  I just wish I could remove the free \"BUTTHEAD\" tattoo from my forehead.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "bad purchase", "Author": "Alana R Olson", "ReviewID": "R14C0UYFFT5Y4U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "2.0 Mp Digital Camera VQ-2005Don't waste your money.
