{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty decent for a basic camera.", "Author": "Matthew High", "ReviewID": "R2E0MVDOADWZ1E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the past few weeks on trips around the state, I have been taking basic snapshots with my cell phone camera, and then picture-messagin them to the web.  But after a few hundred snapshots this can start to add up ($$$), and cell phone cameras are not exactly the highest quality.So, last week I set out to find a very simple, basic, low-cost digital camera.  Browsing through Amazon, there were plenty of cameras to choose from.  And ultimately, I decided to stick with the tried-and-true Kodak company with their Easyshare cameras.  And in particular, I settled on the lower-end of the scale - the Kodak C613.And then, over this past weekend, I went out the eastern High Sierra and snapped away with about 150 photos.Overall, I was pleased with the camera.  It's nothing fancy - just your basic point-and-shoot camera, which is exactly what I'm looking for.  There are about a dozen different settings you can play around with, but for about 90% of the time the \"auto\" function is just fine.  I'm not the type that is trying for \"high art\" photography - I don't have the patience nor the skills for the high-end stuff.  I just want to center the photo on the screen, click the button and that's it.  And this camera is good for people like me.Got back home, and hooked up the camera to the computer with the USB cable, and downloading all the photos was a snap.  I haven't tried using the Easyshare software (and I don't really plan to).  I was also very pleased to see that the quality of the pictures (once on the computer) was quite a bit better than they had originally appeared on the camera viewscreen - more detail and brighter.Problems - I was surprised at the tiny internal memory - it can hold only about a dozen 6 Megapixel pictures (or several dozen smaller-sized pictures), so I immediately went out and bought a 1Gb card for the camera - this is an absolute MUST.  Now I can store thousands of pictures without worry.It runs on AA batteries, and they lasted through the weekend and no more.  I would turn on the camera for about a minute, snap a picture or two, then turn it off until the next shot.  I did this at least 100 times over the weekend, rarely leaving the camera on for more than a couple minutes at a time.  I don't know if this is normal operating time for the batteries, but it would be a good idea carrying around spare batteries.The manual that comes with the camera is a complete joke.  Totally useless.The button layout and operation is a little non-intuitive, but I figure it will just take a little bit of time getting used to it, that's all.The only feature I wish this camera had is a \"timer\" function, so I could set it down and take pictures of myself in front of a big mountain backdrop, for example.  As far as I can tell, no timer.And finally, twice the camera would not start up when I pressed the \"On\" button.  But all I had to do was open and close the battery cover - and it was fine - I assume it's just a very slight short where the battery is/not touching.So, after one weekend trial, I give it a tentative thumbs-up.  It's nothing big and fancy - but then again it's not supposed to be.  Just a simple, low-cost point-and-shoot camera for the simple photographer.", "Date": "October 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Terrific starter camera", "Author": "M. J.

It's got some nice features, including closeup, zoom, adjustable ISO and image stabilization but it's basic operation is very straightforward. The auto-shot produces lovely snapshot photos right out of the box. It's small without feeling fragile. The Easy Share software is a snap to use. I was actually impressed with how easy the software is to use and with Kodak's online gallery.I'd recommend this camera for anyone new to digital photography who wants to take good shots right away while having room to learn and explore new camera concepts.", "Date": "August 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "THE camera  for your grand parents or wife. It's easy to use and very good!", "Author": "Kevin Quattro", "ReviewID": "R3EFGJLFLL5BE7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a fairly serious digital SLR hobbyist photographer and have been hunting for months for that \"right camera\" for the spouse. I can now say I have found it. (and it's not a canon!)I have to say I was mighty impressed with this little sub $120 camera from Kodak. Even before turning it on I quickly realized after a quick scan of the controls--this was the camera for my electronically challenged spouse!It has nice, easy to see and use buttons for the common tasks. Nothing hidden away in layered menus. \"Delete\", \"Review\", \"Zoom Controls\", it's perfect!I also was thrilled that it tells quite clearly on the on-screen display exactly what you are about to do when you change modes or push buttons. So there is never any confusion.It takes regular \"AA\" batteries which is fantastic! My wife is one who never remembers to charge anything! Cell-phones, game pads, bluetooth, etc. So this was very welcome. Slap in some light weight lithium \"AAs\" and if she runs out...a quick trip to the local Rite-Aid, gas station or whatever and she's up and running again.Even though small I appreciated the on-board memory so that at least out of the box you could take some pictures. Instead of leaving grandma clueless. Of course it also excepts SD and is wise to fill it obviously.The camera fills the bill nicely with very good quality snapshop images, records fairly decent and usable 640x480 video with sound too! Everything my wife has been asking about. The video mode won't replace a dedicated camcorder but it will be do the job in nearly 80% of the situations where just a picture won't do.I usually shutter when thinking of installing the software that comes with cameras but I have to say the Easyshare with web support is HIGHLY SUGGESTED. Not only does it suck in the pics from the cam but allows you to very easily make a web gallery. This is great, again, for those that are computer challenged and want to share pics with family. The wife loves it.So why not 5 stars and just 4? It lacks a direct view viewfinder and has no built-in spesker to listen to the audio from video clips. Both minor but enough to drop the rating to 4.", "Date": "September 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "nice little camera", "Author": "Brian Sheets", "ReviewID": "R2SZDLHEZ9T1ZA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "well i read some of the features (finding actual reviews for this is a chore, any \"reviews\" are basically the same things Kodak would release, no real pros and cons or actual experiences.the pictures come out nice sofar.. first thing i did was i bought a 1g card.. and you can forget about alkaline batteries... no life whatsoever.. i tried the ones it came with. thought, okay.. worked for a night, and the camera would not start the next morning.. went and got 2 lithiums and a set of rechargeable Ni-MHs, working fine since..i mainly wanted this camera so i could take clips from my martial arts to study, share, and watch.. granted, i know this isn't a camcorder.. i don't need super resolutions. but id like my audio and video to sync up, beyond like 2 feet away, regardless of the quality. its frustrating hearing movement when there is none currently. i've used a Kodak camera (a couple years old too) before to record matches.. and everything was fine. the video quality itself isn't bad on the camera. good for montages though.. next item on my wish list will be a SD mini camcorder.. then there would be no excuse :)the booklet that comes with this camera is extremely basic, doesn't really tell you much of anything you cant figure out in 5 minutes, unless you are totally inept when it comes to technology. so you can pretty much ignore it.. the camera describes what each setting does when you select it, which is very helpful..it also cant make up its mind how much video it has left.. blank it says somewhere around 40 minutes.. you take a clip for a few seconds, it thinks you have around 73 minutes..I didn't load their programs or anything.. i hate packaged software you dont really need. i got lazy and loaded the connection software however. i also dont like how it doesn't show you how much battery you have left..an eyepiece would be great, so you arent constantly using the screen and drawing battery.. really should have that on a camera.. but its whatever.all in all its a good camera, nothing fancy, easy to figure out. the video is okay if its close up, use anything but alkaline batteries, and an eyepiece would be perfect.", "Date": "September 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "An okay item for a beginner", "Author": "J.

Alcott", "ReviewID": "RE8E8FBRX89XX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first digital camera, and I'm very happy with it. Here's why:Pros:- Easy to use. Once you select the type of picture you're taking (such as close-up, landscape, portrait, action, low-light, bright outdoor, etc.) the camera sets things like shutter and ISO speed automatically. Even if I take a picture with the sun in the picture (such as a sunrise) it still comes out well.- Produces good-resolution photos, at least for smaller size prints. A 3 x 5 printed image on photo paper looks to me almost indistinguishable from a good photo taken on film.- Many features, such as a blur warning icon, zoom, self-timer, auto focus (by holding the shutter down halfway), video, various flash modes. Everything I expected in a basic digital camera, and then some.- Small size and weight - fits easily into a jacket pocket.- Good-sized LCD screen on the back, with a relatively easy-to understand  series of menus you can navigate through to change settings, edit/delete photos, etc.- Easy to connect to a computer via a USB port, and the Kodak software that comes with the camera is straightforward and has useful features of its own. For example, you can enhance the color of your images, correct red eye, crop, zoom, and reduce the file size of an image to make it optimal for sending it as an e-mail attachment or posting it on a web page.Cons:- The two AA batteries that came with the camera were used up quickly, after about five days of occasional picture-taking.- The instruction manual, while it is clear, well-illustrated, and easy to understand, has only minimal detail, and didn't answer all of my  questions. However, the printed manual points you to an online manual on the Kodak website that has much more information.I find this camera to be a very good value when I compare price to features, and I haven't had any problems with it so far. If you buy this camera, I would recommend buying a Secure Digital 1GB memory card (relatively inexpensive, and dramatically increases the number of pictures you can store), as well as rechargeable AA batteries.", "Date": "March 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good inexpensive camera", "Author": "C. Sprankle \"guitar_mom\"", "ReviewID": "R29QAT6QDGQKFM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought one of these for each of my kids (ages 12 and 17) for Christmas.  I didn't want to buy an expensive camera that I would be upset about if they lost or broke, but I did want something that would be easy to use and take decent pictures.  After Christmas, my daughter went on a trip with her school marching band and my son went on a trip with his Scout troop.  They took about 600 pictures between the two of them, in pretty much every conceivable setting (indoor, outdoor, flash, low light, bright light) and I've been pretty impressed with the picture quality.  Neither of them has complained about the camera being difficult to use, and they like the optical zoom.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this camera a five-star rating is that I've had some difficulty downloading the pictures; it seems like both times my son has gone to download his pictures, we've messed around with it for a while, and it wasn't clear to me what it was we finally did to make it work.  I'm also not crazy about the Kodak photo management software, but you don't really have to use that if you don't want to.  Also, you will want to buy an SD memory card in addition to the camera because the built-in memory is minimal.  That is something that wasn't made very clear when I bought it.  Bottom line--an inexpensive, reasonably easy-to-use camera; good for snapshots or a kid's first \"good\" camera.", "Date": "February 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Simple point and shoot camera", "Author": "Frank Hunt", "ReviewID": "R3HM0PJI8GPO8T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great camera for the price.

Quicktime video a downer", "Author": "Mr Tweedy", "ReviewID": "R349S9C6AS18SB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera at Christmas.  It worked fine for a few weeks, then began to exhibit a problem where the camera would turn off on its own after taking a few shots, or would not power up after replacing the batteries.  A web search revealed that this is a fairly common problem with this camera.The camera requires two AA size cells and I initially thought the alkaline batteries I was using just weren't up to the job.  Lithium and NiMH batteries have their advantages, but the Kodak web site indicates that alkalines are suitable.  I tested the used batteries with a voltmeter and they showed almost new condition.  They worked fine in other devices, so excessive power drain did not seem to be the problem.An inspection of the battery compartment door revealed a design problem that may be the cause of the shutdown problem.  The door is not a simple plastic flap.  It has a metal plate and two tiny brass spring tabs that are the actual battery contacts.  A plastic tab protrudes near the positive contact.  I suspect its purpose is to prevent powering the camera if the batteries are inserted backwards.  The problem is that this plastic tab extends too far and prevents the brass contact from making good contact with a properly installed battery.  My solution was to use a hobby knife and carefully lift the brass terminal ever so slightly.  I have not had any shutdown problems since.  I can see how the brass contact could be bent down again with repeated door openings, so it is something I will be watching for in the future.I have since tried Lithium and NiMH batteries and they all work fine.  Lithiums last longest, but have the highest cost.  The camera clock must be reset if the battery compartment is opened for more than a minute or so.  The camera does support the high capacity SDHC memory cards.  I have a 4GB SDHC card and can confirm that it works.  I tried the EasyShare software, but found it cumbersome.  I just remove the SDHC card and plug it into a card adapter on my PC where I can drag and drop.  The memory card slot is located in the battery compartment and I have to remember to check the camera clock every time I replace the card or batteries.The camera produces video in the Quicktime MOV format, which is not compatible with a lot of other viewer applications.  I use the SUPER freeware convertor program to get the video into a more portable format.Otherwise, the camera works great and all its features make it a great value.", "Date": "March 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera Remarkable Value, Kodak Quality", "Author": "Takin Care of Business \"The Deal Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R26EGKE96NPICT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent Point and Shoot camera, sturdily built, compares favorably to cameras costing twice as much.

I like the size. It's big enough that my stiff old paws can hold on to it well. I bought one for my 11 year old granddaughter also, and she loves it. At this price, it won't be a tragedy if she should break it. The instruction book leaves a little to be desired. There is online help, but it took me quite a while to find info on the 'favorites' function. I wanted to manually put some pictures in the camera on the 'favorites' list. Hint: you have to mark them as favorites on the EasyShare application, then go to--tools>cameras/viewers>synchronize.  I would recommend rechargeable batteries. Because it uses the screen as viewfinder, it will eat regular batteries quickly. I bought the Sony charger which comes with 4 AA's in Ni-MH. I know they are making these cameras by the ton, so the quality control might be suspect, but mine is fine. I've only had it since the holidays, so I have to see if it holds up.  I like the image stabilization function, and also in 'auto' mode, it has the little hand icon that tells you if you took a 'shaky' picture. I still have a lot to learn about it, but I'm having fun with it so far. It gets ready to go quickly when you turn it on, and focuses quickly. It's not real fast for rapid picture taking, but hey, it's an inexpensive unit.

The features are great & it is very easy to use, but if you take a lot of indoor photos, don't buy it.  My indoor photos come out grainy & yellow at least 75% of the time.  For outdoor photos, it is a good camera.  The red eye correction in this camera is poor.  With the red eye flash turned on, I still get red eye in almost every photo.  Most of it can be corrected with software, but sometimes it won't correct & it is very time consuming.Overall, if you want a camera for low light situations, make sure you ask someone that has used it first.

Read your manual and play around with the camera before taking the all important shots. Use lithium batteries not regular alkeline. They will last longer. If the camera freezes up, 9 times out of 10, you have either accidently double clicked on the camera or the batteries are low! If after trying it out and their is a legitimate factory problem, do not call Kodak, return it to where you bought it and ask for a new one. Manufacturing problems do happen. I have owned Kodak all my life and upgraded to digital easy share when digital became the rage:) Use the software with it. It allows you to edit your photos in many different ways, including color, enhancement, red eye, etc. loading the pictures from the camera to computer takes seconds and automatically pops up for your review. It is easy for anyone to use! I use it to enter in the photography  divisions at fair competitions, and am looking to expand someday to doing this professionally. Expensive does not mean better.

First of all, it's fairly fast. That's one thing that always bothered me with digital cameras- I hate when they have really slow shutter speeds. Second of all (and most importantly in my case, ha-ha), this camera is a friggin' tank- trust me when I say this camera can take a LOT of abuse- I've dropped this camera from at least 4 feet off the ground countless times- sometimes onto bare concrete, I've accidentally gotten it wet, and once or twice people have dropped it while the lens was open/out, and it's still fine: I recommend this to clumsy people (note: I am not saying `hey go throw your camera out the window and it`ll be fine!' - I`m saying don't worry too much if you`re clumsy or accidentally drop it). Besides that, it takes decent pictures- I don't really bother with all of the different settings, and all of my pictures have turned out fine. It takes good action shots if the flash is on, but of course it'll be harder to get a great action shot with the flash off, you know? The zoom doesn't screw up to quality too much, and it zooms A LOT. Video quality is just dandy, and it has pretty good sound quality when you play it back on the computer. I recommend this camera to amateurs, because it was my first camera and I love it. Plus, it's very cheap.", "Date": "July 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "A digital camera for the rest of us", "Author": "Cara", "ReviewID": "R3O79Z2Q6YJY7Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really didn't want a digital camera and certainly didn't want to spend a lot of money on one. Still, I was sick of disposables and was planning a once-in-a-lifetime trip. So after a lot of dithering I sprang for a refurbished Kodak Easyshare C613--and I'm (almost) really happy with it. (We'll get to the \"almost\" in a minute.) Although \"refurbished\" it had no signs of wear or damage, it's small and light enough to carry easily, has a decent-size display screen, and can be left in point-and-shoot auto mode or adjusted for various conditions: bright or dim light, distance or close-up, fast-moving objects, etc. I knew about the small internal memory--no problem, I just got a 2 GB memory chip, which should hold several years' worth of pictures for me. I had time to try out my new camera before the trip; it came in handy for documenting storm damage to my house, and the document setting let me take and print a backup copy of my passport. On the trip I was so happy about not having to worry about film that I took all kinds of \"impossible\" shots (e.g. at an angle through the side window of a moving tour bus; into the sun; in the rain; without flash inside dimly lit buildings)--and most of them actually came out pretty well. Even some that I'd written off turned out okay when I downloaded them and fiddled with the lighting.Now for the downside: this camera really does eat up batteries. I considered rechargeables but traveling outside the U.S. I didn't want to fool with a recharger and voltage converter. The camera might have used less power if I'd just left it on \"Auto,\" but I was having so much fun trying out all those other settings. I did bring extra batteries (after the originals went out I ran through 2 more sets in about a week) but they always seemed to fail at an inconvenient time with no low-battery warning. More worrying, the first time I put in new batteries it still wouldn't turn on. I was sure I'd inserted the batteries correctly according to the hard-to-read diagram, but when I took a chance and reversed them--it worked! Still, it had been off long enough to mess up the date-and-time setting, and I never did manage to reset it properly.Bottom line: although experienced photographers may sneer, this is a nice digital camera for beginners (if I can figure it out, anybody can), but it does require some patience and flexibility. If you plan to take more than a few pictures you'll need to install a memory chip. The instruction book, as several people have noted, isn't much help, and the time the camera takes to register the picture after you press the button can be annoying, especially if you're not used to digital. There's no view finder. On a long trip if voltage isn't a problem take 2 sets of pre-charged batteries and a recharger. Otherwise you'll need lots of extra batteries; the kind made for digital cameras may last a little longer, but if you have to buy more on the road, regular alkaline AA will do just fine.And by the way you can take some good pictures with the C613.", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Kodak Easyshare C613---Love That Kodak Color!", "Author": "M.

I originally bought one for a friend for Christmas, and I liked it so much, I bought one for myself.  This takes good quality pics outdoors in good light.  Indoors, don't expect to take a flawless pic...they can be a little grainy.  Also, these cameras are basically meant to capture subjects within 6 feet, that way the flash gives off enough light.  I find the controls to be very intuitive. I did read the manual, but once you're acquainted with the C613, you can leave them home thanks to the small \"i\" button, just beneath the \"delete\" button.  Turn the dial on top to select \"favorites, video, auto, image stabilizer, close ups, or \"SCN\" (scene).  Just toggle through the different scene presets (beach, snow, close up of flowers etc...).  Press the \"i\" button, and you get a fairly coherent description of what that scene is for, right there on the LCD screen.  You can also make a few manual adjustments, which make a huge difference...and since you can take thousands of pics, you can keep on shooting til you get it right.  The only downsides for me are (1) the audio quality during video playback is poor (yet my friends is very good), (2) You must reset the date everytime you replace the batteries, and (3) you can't save your own scene settings, so every time you power off and on, you're right back to the default \"auto\" mode. And although it is easy, navigating the menus to make the adjustments is kinda tedious...but if you just leave the camera on, you can continue to take pics using your own manual settings.  I posted some pics on here, have a look.Now, whatever you do, please do NOT pay these ridiculous prices they're asking for this camera.  I mean a couple of hundred bucks?  That's insane in 2010.

I wanted to get a high quality but low cost camera and so after reading the reviews, here on Amazon, I selected this C613 Kodak model. The quality of the pictures is not appreciably different from the SD630. The responsiveness (latency after pushing the button) is worse than the SD630 but only noticeably when the flash is used. The controls are very intuitive and my 4 year old son was very happy taking snapshots and reviewing them within 20 minutes. The double AA batteries don't last more than 200 shots with flashes. Given that this camera cost one quarter of what I paid for the SD630 I am very very happy with the purchase.", "Date": "December 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Kodak rules!", "Author": "Juan Altuve \"juanex\"", "ReviewID": "R2JVA2D1VEESPE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you very much.

That's the only good thing about it.I bought these two cameras because the lens on my Kodak DX6340 wouldn't retract.The HP is much better. It's a Photosmart R847. You cn do more than crop the image. You can change the image to a watercolor or  sketch. Before you buy this Kodak check out the HP R 847. The viewing screen is huge.
