{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The greatest / smallest camera I have ever owned", "Author": "Ann T. Verschuuren", "ReviewID": "R1SCE8EYTTWS6B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "IF you are into small & simple - this is your camera.  I love that it fits in my pocket and that I can still use a small cute evening bag.  Everyone who see's me using it has something positive to say about the size. The screen is large enough to see without using my cheater-readers.  Since it is small, the features are very streamlined and simple to use.  This meets my needs: point and shoot.  There are a few features (zoom, tap screen to take pix or use regular button, self-timer, adjustable flash, and special effects such as shooting in different colors and using a fish eye for a wild distorted look) but I really was looking for a camera that I could use instead of my cell phone (which no longer focuses correctly).  The pictures are focused and clear - and will blow up to 5x7 with little loss of clarity. To download pix to my computer you just plug in the cord provided...and the camera is recognized as a USB.  Simple to use. I love it, but hesitated giving it 5 stars due to the \"limited\" features.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Size", "Author": "Hugh", "ReviewID": "R28TNLAKQEL5U6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Convenient size but screen is almost useless in bright light.Paid $160 recently and Nikon dropped the price to $99 already.
