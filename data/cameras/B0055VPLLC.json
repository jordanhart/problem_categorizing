The only big difficulty with the setup are the poor instructions but if you're fairly technical, you can work through it.  I've seen a lot a complaints about the email feature not working & had a problem with this initially myself.  After some research & much thought I realized the problem was my own fault!  You MUST put a DNS server address into the configuration or else (duh) the DVR will not be able to resolve you email server address.  The alternative, which works just as well, is to use an IP address in the email setup server field.  I hope these guys will (future) support browsers other than IE but the remote viewing using IE does work well (setup, not so much).  Also use the Android app with few issues. Overall, 5 stars...  Only complaints are the user interface (setup) is a bit cumbersome and motion region settings are confusing & questionable; instructions difficult to follow in some areas; you will have to go digging to find the meaning of some of the settings; occasional freezing of the Android app and again; the lack of non IE browser support.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.99", "Features": "Network Access and Live View via Smart Phone & 3G Mobile (iPhone & Google Android)\nTV Monitor BNC Output and PC Monitor VGA Output\nH.264 Hardware Compression\nPTZ via RS485 Port\n1/4\" Color CMOS Cameras with 420 TV-Lines, Night Vision up to 30'", "Name": "ZMODO PKD-DK0865-500GB 8 CH CCTV Security Weatherproof Outdoor IR Cameras Surveillance DVR System 500GB", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51O8zuVbRVL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0055VPLLC"}}
