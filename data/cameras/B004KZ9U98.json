{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wish I had known earlier", "Author": "Jolly Roger", "ReviewID": "RDZWQCWQTIWQA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a 16 channel surveillance camera system (Lorex).  The adapters shipped with the package are rated at \"2 Amps,\" and they attach to a 4-way splitter for power.  I discovered an 8-way splitter on Amazon, purchased that and swapped out the 4-way for the 8-way so I could power up to 8 cameras with 1 adapter.  I'm glad I ended up touching the adapter the next day...it was HOT!  I then did some research.  I am no electrician and I have no specialized knowledge thereon.  I wanted to write this review so others similarly situated might benefit.  To do so, though, I need to provide a little math (sorry!):I have two types of cameras:  bullets and domes.  The bullets are each rated to draw 500 milliamps; the domes pull 250 milliamps.  Incidentally, the bullets I have are here:  Lorex Weatherproof Super Plus Resolution Security Camera LBC7051.  Therefore, if one uses 4 such bullet cameras , that will pull 2 amps (i.e., 500 milliamps x 4 = 2 amps).  Eight bullets will pull 4 amps, etc.  So, I realized that I probably didn't have enough amps in my ADAPTERS to power the amount of cameras I had.I then discovered the Q-See adapter.  It was confusing because the picture only showed the 8-way splitter.  Rest assured, it does come with, also, a 4 way splitter and a 5 amp power adapter.  In using this, the adapter isn't nearly as hot and I feel comfortable that the adpater can handle my max load of 4 amps (i.e., if I power 8 bullets at once, each pulling 500 milliamps).So, my only regret is that I didn't find this item a bit earlier since I spent about $20 on two 8-way splitters that didn't even include a power adapter!  I'm happy I found this item...better late then never.  If I decide to expand my system where it would be helpful to purchase another one of these power adapter/splitter sets by Q-See, I hope they are still being sold from Amazon.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect for freeing up space on my surge protecter.", "Author": "Jason Fraser", "ReviewID": "R1WV2HZM9MZXGN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When buying individual or dual pack cameras, each camera comes with one adapter with one connection.

All 4 cameras are analog wired, so I can run one siamese video/power cable from each camera. I then plug the video into the 4-channel balun which connects to a Cat 6 cable, and I plug the power connector into this cable. The plug end of the power can plug into an outlet in my attic, while the Cat 6 means just one line to run down to my DVR.Good product!", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "works great", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R2APEZW9XHXCZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It eliminated seven a/c power adapters,have less clutter and  looks much better and seems to be working as advertised thanks!", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I ordered", "Author": "Eric Beckman", "ReviewID": "R1Q8S46J5S6O16", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just what I needed, the description helped in my troubleshooting of the device and it arrived just as described.

Lord", "ReviewID": "RFDOWEYO4SBK1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a Q-See QM6006B-4 camera system and installed it using two 100 foot long cables and two of the standard 60 foot cables, which came with the system. About three weeks later, all four of my cameras were not working and all I saw was \"Video Loss\". Q-See's product support / customer service was no help (ridiculously slow to respond with little to no information). After troubleshooting and some research via the Web, I was able to determine that the power adapter was not working. The 3000mA power adapter that came with the system was insufficient because I added a couple of longer cables, which required more power or caused a power loss. This product is more than sufficient to power my four cameras because it is 5000mA (5amps). It comes with one four wire splitter and one eight wire splitter, so you can use whichever you require. I now have peace of mind that my system will not stop working.
