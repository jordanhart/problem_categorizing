I was not sure if it would have worked with my ptz camera (Agasio A622W), but it worked flawlessly and even added features based on the qnap built In software.After upgraded the firmware finding the camera was easy, the full time recorded was a feature I was very interested in, and that works perfectly. I have 2 WD 3TB hard drives installed. Initializing them gave me a little trouble but once that was completed the combination of them with the unit was perfect. After about 2 weeks of continous recording from 3 camers the unihaunt used 35% of the hard drives running raid 1 mirroring.The unit is work 5 stars or atleast 4.5, however the search algorithms need a little work. The motion detection works well, but I have been unable to get the added item or missing item to work. I tested it using a 5 gallon bucket about 100' away from the camera with no luck.I will update my review as I add more cameras and test the unit more.I would definitely recommend buy this type of unit.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent nvr.", "Author": "rka", "ReviewID": "R24CHN3U3R56E7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good device nut you will need to buy quality drives to insert.
