{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Micro Four Thirds Camera on the Market (for now)", "Author": "mrxak", "ReviewID": "RMFTMUJJKH2O9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Professional image quality testing has been done, and the verdict is in. This camera beats the Olympus OM-D EM-5... just barely. Image quality off both camera sensors is fantastic and nearly identical, but the GH3 edges out the EM-5 by just a little bit of dynamic range. The EM-5 is a little cheaper, though. Right now, the GH3 is fairly expensive, but what you pay for is the best camera in this format money can buy, and I'm not just talking about image quality.Other reviews cover a lot of things about image quality and technical specifications, far more in depth than I'll go here. What I want to talk about is handling, video, and the general advantages of the Micro Four Thirds format.Chances are, if you are considering the GH3 at all, you fall under one of three categories. You are either a serious enthusiast, a professional photographer, or you want to make movies. This is probably not going to be your very first system camera, and it's definitely not a point-and-shoot camera for amateurs. That's not to say the GH3 is overly complicated or unapproachable if you're new to photography, but I should think a cheaper camera would fit your needs fine.The GH3 is a very special camera, with lots to love for those who love cameras. If you're a serious enthusiast, you should consider the EM-5 as well as the GH3. There are pros and cons for both cameras. I'll let you go read up on the EM-5 on your own, but for the GH3, it has a lot in its favor. Top of the list is handling. The GH3 is the largest camera in the format, this is true, but what you gain in bulk and weight, you also gain in ergonomics. There are lots and lots of physical buttons, five of them customizable, and nearly all of them usable one-handed without any awkwardness. The software is fantastic, too, giving you additional programable buttons on the touch screen, as well as Panasonic's fully configurable Quick Menu. There are tons and tons of options to set to get your camera working just the way you want it to. Everything is very well laid out and fairly intuitive. The dials and control wheels feel solid and work great. Even the largest of lenses balance very well on the GH3, thanks to its weight and best-in-format grip. Don't let its size fool you though, it's only a little heavier than the EM-5. Along with that size comes a very large battery. Technical specs I think are conservative on the lifespan of a charge, too. This is the best camera battery I've ever encountered, letting me shoot far longer than I am used to. All-in-all, the GH3 fits wonderfully in the hand, is very easy to shoot with, and gives you a huge amount of control. If you're an enthusiast photographer or serious prosumer, the GH3 will not disappoint. As an enthusiast, though, you've got plenty of options in the format and you should look carefully at many other models that may be cheaper but still quite satisfying.If you are a professional, I think you'll appreciate much of the same things enthusiasts do, like what I mentioned above. But there's more in this camera that seems intended just for you. The Wi-Fi \"Lumix Link\" will let you upload images directly from the camera as you shoot, letting your customers see immediately what you're doing. You can also use it to trigger the shutter remotely or change settings. If wireless isn't your thing, there's an HDMI port and AV port. I have to believe the fully articulated touch screen will let you make difficult shots easy, such as doing macro on a product at a weird angle. The DSLR-type body will be very familiar to you, as well, though this is a mirrorless camera which means it's a much lighter camera than you're probably used to (more on this later). If you work with video at all for hybrid products, the live electronic viewfinder during movie recording will be a welcome change from optical viewfinders. As I mentioned before, the battery is quite large, but if you need more juice and don't want to switch batteries, there's a (sold-seperately) battery grip that will improve handling with portrait shots and give you even more endurance on a shoot. You will probably get some use out of the flash synchro socket and/or hot shoe. The buffer seems to be quite huge, and with a fast card shooting RAW in burst mode, it's very difficult to slow the camera down. There aren't more than a handful of weatherproof lenses for Micro Four Thirds so far, but if you have any the GH3 is weatherproof and will give you a seal to protect your system while you're shooting in wet environments. The camera is built with high quality, solid materials. All-in-all, the GH3 is perhaps the first Micro Four Thirds camera aimed squarely at the professional market, whether or not you've been tempted by the format before. It gives you enormous control, but gets out of your way when you're working. If you are a professional photographer, you are sure to appreciate the design considerations Panasonic made to make this a camera you can get serious work done with.If you are a videographer, why are you even reading this review? There is simply no better camera for the movie-maker in this price range, and the video quality you'll get off of this camera will surpass hybrid or video-only cameras that cost considerably more. That said, video was one of my primary reasons for getting this camera, so I'll give you the most important details. Of all the codecs you're most likely to use, the six big ones are 1080p 24fps 50Mbps, 1080p 30fps 50Mbps, 1080p 60fps 50Mbps, 1080p 24fps 72Mbps (ALL-INTRA), 1080p 30fps 72Mbps (ALL-INTRA), or 720p 60fps 72Mbps (ALL-INTRA). You have a full-sized 3.5mm (1/8\") microphone port, no need for an adapter like with the GH2, and a 3.5mm (1/8\") headphone port for sound out while shooting. Of course, the GH3 has a stereo mic build-in. You can set mic levels right on the camera. There's all kinds of options for time code. As a videographer, you may still want to consider the GH2. Video quality is better on the GH3 in testing, even compared to the hacked GH2, but the GH2 is considerably cheaper and the difference in quality may not be enough. If you're a small budget indie filmmaker, choose carefully. All-in-all, if you can afford one, the GH3 out of the box is truly a fantastic video camera and competes at a much higher level for the price. It really puts other cameras to shame, even dedicated video cameras. If you are a videographer, or even a professional filmmaker, this camera has pretty much everything you want.Which brings me to an important point. This is a hybrid camera, not merely an excellent still camera. For the price of one professional-quality camera, you're really getting two. If you happen to like taking still pictures AND video, the GH3 offers tremendous value. If you're creating hybrid products as a professional, there's really no other single camera that can do as well as this. If you're a hobbyist with interest in both pictures and video, this can save you a lot of money. The GH2 was good, this is better. Micro Four Thirds has finally arrived at the next level, not for stills-only, but for stills and video. If the EM-5 made Micro Four Thirds a serious format for still photography, the GH3 ups the ante and makes the format a viable platform for a whole new market.Micro Four Thirds is the only truly mature mirrorless camera system. There are other mirrorless systems, to be sure, but Micro Four Thirds has a huge selection of first-party and third-party lenses, low end and high end, covering a huge range of focal lengths and apertures. The diversity of bodies from Panasonic and Olympus means there's probably a good camera for you no matter who you are. When you buy a system camera, it's reassuring to know that you're making a good investment. Micro Four Thirds is not going away any time soon. There's lots of great lenses available, and many more coming out. There's also adapters for many other lens formats, so there is almost limitless legacy glass available for any need, provided you don't mind manual focus. Mirrorless means thinner and lighter camera bodies, and Micro Four Thirds lenses need only half the focal length to achieve the same field of view as full frame cameras which means smaller and cheaper lenses for the same zoom factor. With two companies competing in the same format, there is a lot of innovation and a lot of options for users.We'll see what happens over the next year from Panasonic and Olympus. New models are due out from both companies, as is the endless march of progress. For the time being, at least, the GH3 is a fantastic camera, and depending on your needs, it may be the best camera in this format for you until the GH4 comes out. Certainly for the moment, it has the best image quality available, and is a great camera to actually use. If you don't need the best that Micro Four Thirds has to offer, there are a lot of other great cameras to choose from in the format.Happy shooting!", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice To Meet You", "Author": "Dionisio Kamanel", "ReviewID": "R2QSEYNJ29KL8Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been waiting for this camera for about 4 years. In 2008 I was looking for the best camera that excelled in both stills and video. I settled for a JVC camcorder which recorded in SD and took 5mp stills. I moved to a Sony SR-11 for HD and interlaced 10mp stills. I was unsatisfied with the stills of the Sony so I bought an Oly E-420 touted as the smallest DSLR to accompany my camcorder. For over a year I dealt with the cumbersome set up of camcorder, DSLR body, 2 lenses and a tripod with mixed results to boot.Enter the GH2 and 2 issues were somewhat solved at once. The 1st problem was bulk and the other being image quality. The stills of the GH2 was a major step up to my Oly E-620 and the video quality was also significantly upgraded as a result.Now finally to the GH3 {while comparing to the GH2... I say that the GH2 feels and looks like a toy, yet is quite a serious tool under the hood so to speak. The advantage of looking like a toy was the incognito factor. In contrast, the GH3 has an excellent form, feel and look to it. It fits like a glove for me when operating. As a photographer our camera is like an appendage after all. The GH3 with a 12-35mm attached is light and remains relatively compact.The location of levers and buttons are logically placed. I initially thought the lever to change from AF to MF was in a bad place and hard to turn. I was trying to make the adjustment with my forefinger (because I almost always have it mounted on a tripod) but it was clearly designed to be turned with the thumb which is stronger. I appreciate the ability to open the battery compartment and not have to remove my quick release tripod plate. I used to always accidently press the WB button of the GH2 and even change settings. The WB and ISO buttons are now on top. No more accidents.Another major improvement is the speed. The burst shots are very responsive with no lag writing to the card until after 30 shots or so. I use a San Disk 95 mbs write speed which shines now. I was amazed of the processor speed of the GH3 when I would finish doing a burst of 5 shots or so (always RAW) and then press the video button and start recording right away. I have missed many key moments in video on the GH2 because I was waiting for it to finish writing to the memory card.It absolutely destroys the GH2 on this.The electronic shutter is not virtually silent on a AF lens. You will hear the lens (not the body) make a small adjustment sound. This is still perfectly acceptable even in places demanding silence. One of the serious problems with Electronic Shutter is the bands / electronic stripes (like video of a CRT screen) that ruin images in certain artificial lighting.As a so called hybrid shooter I welcome the advantages of the GH3 over the GH2 in speed and ease of transition between the mediums. The 1st thing I noticed was the manual Movie Mode which is not placed after all the C (Custom Settings) but right after M (Manual). I often shoot in A (Aperture) Mode and switch to manual Movie mode so I have 3 less turns to do now. The other thing is when recording video on PASM in the GH2 it would default to the lowest Bit Rate 17 mbps. Now it records in whatever mode you have set up like the MOV 1080 60p @ 50mbps without having to switch to manual.  I have a couple of gripes I am having a difficult time accepting though. The 1st is the EVF compared to the GH2. It now has a more \"digitized\" look to it. The noise (grain) is excessive in many cases. The EVF eye piece is much smaller also for some reason. A missing feature (that I miss anyways) is the \"My Menu\" found on the GH2 which lets you quickly access the last 5 menu features you used. I would use this to access things like formatting the memory card (instead of digging in the menu).I just finished a weekend of shooting multiple events related to Art Basel Miami and I found myself thoroughly enjoying the shooting experience even though I just received the camera a day prior. The excellent Lumix 12-35mm has a lot to do with my positive experience. A fellow video shooter with a Canon 1D was impressed with the Continual AF speed and accuracy of the GH3 via the rear view monitor. I like the extras like Level Gauge, Intravalometer and WiFi to name a few useful features added to the GH3. The battery life is greatly improved too. I took 100's of stills and video clips the other night and it still showed 2 bars left. The GH2 has aweful banding on video especially with clear blue skies. I shot a beach scene w/ the GH3 (with bright blue skies) at 7mm on a Lumix 7-14mm and saw less banding. Many of the strong points of the GH2 made it to the GH3 like EX TELE Convert feature though it has it's quirks.This hybrid is the best we have yet available, but it is not perfect. With present technology we could have had an even better solution by now IMO. Yet at $1300 I think this is a good value and worthy tool to produce excellent images. BTW we may have some significant updates via next firmware for the GH3 relatively soon.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Very Successful Upgrade", "Author": "Todd B", "ReviewID": "RSLZS1EBGPBLF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having now spent a few weeks with this camera I feel I can provide an honest review of the GH3 and how it compares to it's well-regarded predecessor, the GH2.  What seems clear from the onset of testing is that Panasonic has listened to the feedback it sought from photographers and videographers alike prior to designing a GH2 replacement.  The body is much more solid and refined in it's ergonomics and controls.  This camera now feels as professional as it's larger/heavier full frame and APS-C competitors (especially with the battery grip), but retains a nimbleness those cameras will never be able to match.  The user interface is much more straight forward now and no longer requires a decryptor ring in order to select video shooting modes.  In fact each menu option that is highlighted can now describe in detail what it's purpose is before it is activated, deactivated or changed.The new OLED screen is simply stunning and accurately displays color and exposure, even in bright outdoor shooting.  I find myself leaving an external monitor at home for my outdoor shoots because it just adds weight to my kit without really improving functionality.  The viewfinder is nice as well, but I've noticed it can suffer from some image smearing around the outer edges if your eye is not perfectly aligned to it's center.  WiFi remote control works great on the Samsung Galaxy and Asus Transformer, but I have not yet tested it on iPads or iPhones.  The 50mbps IPB codec is excellent and can be pushed further in grading and recovery than previous hacked GH2 codecs I've used.  Dynamic range, noise/grain, low light performance and ISO color shift (no more green tinting at higher ISOs) all seem improved over the GH2.Raw still images have much better highlight recovery now as well.  Where the GH2 has maybe 1/2 a stop of highlight recovery, the GH3 seems more like 1 to 1.5 stops of recovery which makes exposing for shadows much easier and is great when working in timelapse.  Speaking of timelapse, the new electronic shutter feature and built-in intervalometer are brilliant.  With the battery grip added you can take literally thousands of pictures in electronic shutter mode without killing the batteries.  The only downside is that exposures greater than 1 sec in this mode are not (yet) available, so you will need to change over to the mechanical shutter for longer exposures.  The camera can also be set to go into sleep mode when timelapsing in long intervals, further saving it's already outstanding battery life.  To date I have yet to run into any video moire problems, which appears to be a much more inflated issue online then is justified in the real world.  My preferred video settings are Contrast -5, Sharpness 0, Saturation 0, NR -5.In conclusion, this is the camera I have been waiting for as a professional videographer and photographer.  It does everything I need it to do in a light weight kit and does it exceedingly well given it's price point.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "GH Series Grows Up: GH2 vs GH3 Pros and Cons", "Author": "David Siegfried", "ReviewID": "R28GNI3QMOG5QI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been an avid user of the GH series since the GH1. I use these cameras mostly for video, because I shoot Canon DSLRs for most of my stills. The GH series cameras are optimized for video and produce crisper video than the Canon DSLRs, whereas the Canon DSLRs have more dynamic range and color depth and less noise at all ISOs. I have been following the GH13 firmware patches by Russian hacker Vitaly on Personal View since the beginning and have applied the hacks to the GH1 and GH2 with mixed results.The GH3 now has a more solid weatherproofed build and the buttons are laid out like a true DSLR. It's like the GH2 has grown up to compete head to head in the DSLR market. But can it really compete with the big boys? You can read about the improved build and other new features in many reviews, but I'm going to focus here mostly on image quality.While the GH2 was an improvement over the GH1, the advertized gains in low light (noise) and dynamic range performance were a disappointment*. Still photography images were virtually the same, but the quality of motion video was improved considerably, particularly if the hack was applied.My first test of the GH3 was taking still photographs in controlled studio lighting. First impression of the JPEGs out of the camera is very good. Although at low ISO the difference from the GH2 is hard to see at first, upon examination there is significantly more detail in the shadow areas, the reds are richer, and the overall tint is more accurate. The GH2 images appear to have a green cast by comparison.Moving up into the higher ISOs, around ISO 3200 the differences are stark. Here the GH2 has blotchy noise, a muddy green cast in the shadows and the colors are muted. The GH3 retains finer grain all the way up to ISO 6400, the colors are bright and the images are actually usable. At 100% the GH3 has some mosquito JPEG artifacts evident as random pinpoints of noise vs. the GH2 which has dark blotches and smeared details.After upgrading ACR to handle the new RAW files, I took another look at the same set of photos in RAW. The RAW files reveal the fact that the JPEG engine in the GH3 is doing a heavy amount of noise reduction. Even at the base ISO of 200, quite a bit of noise is present in the RAW images, more than I would like to see. With an aggressive amount of noise reduction applied, the RAW files can be made to look as good and then a bit better than the JPEGs out of the camera. But the conclusion is that the JPEG engine has already been optimized to make the images look as good as possible, and RAW processing is not gaining a whole lot, except for the ability to fine tune and fix any white balance errors.The still photos are pretty significantly improved over the GH2, and those already heavily invested in Micro 4/3 lenses will be glad to know that the investment will be put to good use on this body. But what many are dying to know is how much improvement there is in the video. What videographers are looking for is more dynamic range and a reduction or elimination of macroblocking and pixelation in heavy motion scenes.There is good news here too: The GH3 pulls moderately more detail out of the shadow areas than the GH2. It's subtle but it's there: there is a bit more detail and less pixelated busyness in the grain. Again at high ISOs the difference is more drastic. The new All-I MOV codec is much more solid and easier to grade and edit without the image falling apart, without resorting to hacking the firmware. The other significant change is that the new menu allows for setting sharpness, contrast, and noise reduction in five steps up or down rather than three. Even with the sharpness turned to -3 on the GH2, the video looked unnaturally sharp with halos and aliasing. Now, with the sharpness turned all the way down to -5, the video looks more natural and the halos and aliasing are gone. Sharpening can now be adjusted in post more tastefully. Unfortunately, Panasonic removed two of my favorite photo styles for shooting video: Smooth and Cinema. In fact, they renamed all of them except for Standard and now there are only five instead of seven. The new styles Natural and Portrait are good choices for video. There are also many scene and creative control styles that have major effects on the overall look.I have one main issue with this camera and that is the fact that the base ISO is 200. I didn't like it when they changed the base ISO from 100 to 160 on the GH2, and a base ISO of 200 is even worse. A base ISO of 200 on a micro 4/3 camera has about the same signal to noise ratio as ISO 800 on a full-frame DSLR**. That is hardly a very clean ''best'' setting. Smaller sensor cameras should be allowing us to begin at a LOWER base ISO, not a higher one, in order to have the finest grain and least amount of noise possible. And especially for video you really need to be able to shoot at lower ISOs in bright light, otherwise you are forced to have to use neutral density filters.  The camera has an extended ISO that allows you to shoot at 125, but in manual movie mode it forces you back to ISO 200. Ideally I would like to be able to shoot at ISO 50 but at least all other digital cameras allow you to shoot at ISO 100. This is very frustrating and I don't understand why Panasonic doesn't allow this.My second problem with this camera is the cost. This Micro 4/3 camera now costs TWICE as much as a good consumer grade DSLR such as the Canon T41. Even after adding on a few standard lenses, the DSLR becomes a less expensive solution while producing superior still images.The loss of the multi-format sensor is a mixed bag. On the one hand, the 3x2 and 16x9 photos have lower resolution, and for video all your lenses are going to be slightly cropped compared to the GH2. On the other hand, this could be a positive if you are using legacy lenses such as B4 mount 2/3\" lenses which have soft corners; some of the offending corners are cropped off. In the end, the improved image quality of this sensor wins out over the loss of the multi-format oversized sensor.The new WiFi feature is the most sophisticated of any camera. It allows you to remotely control the camera's functions from your smartphone, immediately play back pictures on your phone or TV, immediately send pictures to your PC as you take them, and send stored pictures to your smartphone/pc/cloud service/web service/printer. I have not yet tested the WiFi features.Here are the pros and cons of the GH3:Pros:Excellent JPEG EngineIncreased dynamic rangeImproved low light/high ISO performanceMore accurate colorsWider control over contrast, sharpness, saturation, & noise reductionVideo quality exceeds most DSLRsSturdy buildBetter button layoutBetter, larger LCDLonger lasting batteryRobust video codec that does not require a hack for pro editingFast and very accurate auto-focusIn-camera HDR works wellSilent electronic shutter optionSophisticated WiFi featuresCons:Base ISO of 200 is restrictive & frustratingRAW files reveal that true levels of noise are high even at base ISOVery little gains to be had shooting in RAWNo Smooth or Cinema picture stylesConsiderably more expensive than many DSLRsStill photography still inferior to most DSLRsLoss of multi-format sensor could be a complaint for some.My overall impression of the camera is very good, and I will probably be getting rid of the GH2 and finally giving up on the frustrating exercise of trying to get the 'perfect' hack settings out of it. The GH3 doesn't need the hack, with the robust 72 mbps MOV codec it's reliable and ready out of the box for professional cinematographers and hobbyists. The only thing that bothers me about it is not being able to shoot below ISO 200 in manual movie mode, but I will have to learn to live with that. The cost remains a big issue; for the same amount you could buy two GH2s and have some money left over to put towards the 12-35mm f/2.8 lens. GH2 hackers who already like what they have will probably want to wait until the cost comes down, and most photographers who don't shoot video will get more quality for their dollars with a DSLR.*DxOMark actually gave the GH2 sensor a lower rating than the GH1 in all three categories: Color Depth, Dynamic Range, and Low Light ISO.**I compared the RAW files. At ISO 200, the grain or noise from the GH3 is actually slightly WORSE than the Canon 5D Mark III at ISO 800.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Micro Four Thirds Workhorse", "Author": "Parka", "ReviewID": "R237YJM44CTY5C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "- This review was updated on 2 Dec 2013 -In this review, I'll make occasional mention to the GH2 which I used to have and the Fujifilm X-Pro1 which I also use.- BUILD QUALITY -GH3 is built like a top quality APSC DSLR except in a slightly smaller size. It's 550g body alone with batteries. Just for comparison, Canon 7D is 915g with batteries. Compared to the GH2, GH3 is big. When I first held it, I was wondering if it's really a Micro Four Thirds camera. It looks like it could fit an APSC lens -- X-Pro1's almost the same size without the grip and flash hump.The body is hard. Hand grip is comfortable. Buttons are easy to press. Dial wheels are nice to turn. I love the two dial wheels. The overall ergonomics is one reason why I upgrade.Major bummer for me is the battery cover which is too loose and will open with just a gentle brush against it. It has opened accidentally many times for me.- EVF -It's slightly smaller than the GH2 and I'm still trying to get used to it after weeks.There are reviews online complaining about the smearing EVF at the edges. It happens to me too. I'm wearing spectacles. You have to place your eye exactly in the centre to get everything clear. You know the plastic in front of the EVF, it's like their edges are of different thickness hence you get the smearing when your eye is over those areas. It's not really a big deal for me since the EVF is just for framing. However if you're manual focusing with the EVF, keep your eye in the centre or it will be difficult to tell what is in focus.Other than that, the refresh rate seems better.The EVF scratches easily. Considered yourself warned. I had mine replaced and I still don't know where the scratches come from.- LCD -The articulating LCD screen looks and works great. But mine got loose after a few months and had it replaced. This does not seem to be an isolated incident online.- AUTOFOCUS -It's almost instantaneous. With the responsive touchscreen, you can also choose the AF points quickly.- IMAGE QUALITY -ISO performance is about 1 stop better than GH2. Personally I will stay around ISO 3200 and below. Noise detail is quite rough at high ISOs.Colors are fine. Because of the improved dynamic range, photos feel like they have more depth. I still prefer the colours of X-Pro1.They lost the multi-aspect sensor so the 3:2, 16:9, 1:1 ratios are 14MP, 14MP and 12MP. Not really a big deal unless you really need higher resolutions.For stills, the sensor seems less capable of creating moire. For example with GH2, if you're shooting a book with a picture on it, more than half the time you'll get moire. In real life, moire problem is rare. I'm saying this because sometimes I have problems with the GH2 but not anymore with GH3.- VIDEO -Strangely, there's higher tendency for moire to appear than GH2. Moire is slight. However, it's irritating if you can't use a footage because of moire. It's not easy to spot video moire on LCD and that adds to the problem. For production work, you will need on set to have a screen capable of displaying 1080P. I'm a bit disappointed in this area. There are several discussions online about this issue and I will suggest you read up more if video is important to you.For the 1080P 50FPS or 60FPS, you get up to 50Mbps output. Lower FPS gives you 72Mbps. That's some detailed video files to work on. At 1080P 50FPS, it's about 10MB per second of footage. Get a huge SD card. I recommend the Transcend Class 10 UHS 85/45 MB/s because it's value for money.- PERFORMANCE -The battery gives me about 500 shots with some video.You can now utilize the full speed of a 95MB/s SD card with the GH3, an improvement over GH2.Menus are quick and simple to navigate. Overall functionality feels responsive.- OTHER STUFF -Electronic shutter is nice. You can shoot silently in RAW up to ISO 1600. It's great to use it with the inbuilt intervalometer for timelapse so you don't have to use the physical shutter.There's Wifi and I believe you can download some iPhone app to work with the camera. I don't use this so I can't comment further.I love the many customizable function buttons. There's a list of menu items you can assign to them. The bad thing is, for some buttons, that list can be much shorter so you won't get to set what you want to that one particular button even though you can do so with the other buttons. Why do this, Panasonic?- CONCLUSION -The durability of the build quality is slight questionable. Mine had the EVF scratched, and the LCD came loose. Either it's my luck or it's the camera, but I've read similar experiences online.Should you upgrade from GH2? I did, and I did it for the ergonomics, video, and better dynamic range. If you want to upgrade for video, I suggest you read up more on the video moire issue. If you're just upgrading for the better image quality, well, you'll have to judge the price over value ratio yourself. For dynamic range, I can understand. For ISO performance, why not try a faster lens if possible?Why do I have the X-Pro1? I love Fujifilm's colour, and the manual way of shooting (aperture rings on lens). For leisure, I use the X-Pro1. It is a video moire monster which is why I still need Micro Four Thirds.GH3 is a workhorse to me. If I'm on assignment and unfamiliar with the ground, I will bring the GH3 -- no thinking required. It is feature packed, capable and predictable. With the whole family of Micro Four Thirds lens, it covers all sorts of shooting situations. I was on board a ship recently and had to use the widest lens possible for tight spaces, the Panasonic 7-14mm lens. I stood 4 hours with the camera and lens (850g) hanging over my neck. There's some strain at the end of the day, but I won't trade this setup for anything else.4 out of 5 stars.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost the perfect camera", "Author": "I Live in 91607", "ReviewID": "RF1JSM32B0HKX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "THis is my 2nd GH3.

After 800 I do notice some noise.  6) Customizable buttons!! A LOT!!  7)  The feel in my hands. Perfect.  Now what I don't like  1) I wish the timer would auto bracket the shots when set. The Nikon and Canon both do that. I had to buy at remote shutter release cable. An inconvenience to carrying around for those twilight shots. Finally - what everyone else has said about the camera is true. After another motnh or so, I may end up selling my Nikon D800 and Canon Mark III.  Oh - I'm using the Panny with a Oly 9-18 lens.  I tried the Panny 7-14 but horrible flare problems.Update: After having the 2nd camera for less than a month I've discovered a few issues. I was using my Canon external flash and it worked fine for about a week then the hot shoe became slightly loose and the flash wouldn't fire. It worked perfectly on my Canon Mark III and still does. I tried another flash on the Panny and still no luck. Defective hot shoe. I had to return the 2nd GH3 but got another one....I liked it that much!!  The new one seems to be working fine with the external flash. Another issue has been occasional out of focus shots.  The camera would beep \"in focus\" but after downloading the photos, several were out of focus. I had this problem as well with the previous GH3. I was using single point focusing. Then I tried a different focus setting...pinpoint. It zooms in quickly and you can see whether or not it's truly in focus.  Some registered \"in focus\" but weren't so I had to move the focus point to a good contrast area to achieve true focus. Ever since then, all my photos have been in focus. Every camera has it's quirks. Getting to know them is the key to getting good shots. One thing I'm concerned about is the longevity of the camera.  I'm a working photographer and put about  8,000 to 10,000 shutter clicks on my cameras per month. I had a Nikon D700 for years and ran it up to 300,000 shutter clicks with no problems. I also had a Sony SLT A77 that started to fail after 8 months. It was in for service twice. I love the GH3. It's light and gives me results in the easiest way possible. I don't invest in cameras unless it makes my job easier. The GH3 feels solid for what it is but only time will tell.Update: After 2 months, I found that this is the ONLY camera I have ever used that has a truly amazing AWB. It is very close to being perfect. If not, at least it makes it much easier to correct in PS or other photo programs.  However, in difficult situations - such as colored walls, etc... I still manual white balance and it brings it to almost 95% perfect.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Video Camera for the Price", "Author": "Raymond R. Jackson", "ReviewID": "R3Q26J3JHF2Y2F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I rented this camera for two jobs over a single weekend.  One was a wedding and another a small business product demo both were for video.  I was able to get a few still shots with it and they looked good but did not get enough time with photos to give a review on still images.Many people have already stated this but coupled with the right lenses this camera gives absolutely amazing images for video.  Color performance was the best out of camera of any that I have used.  I did not feel any need to correct the color in post which is something that is pretty rare for me.  The dynamic range was also good when compared to my Canon T3i DSLR.  I overexposed some bright outdoor shots at the wedding, no ND filter, and the detail was still very good.  Correcting the image in post brought it back to normal levels and with the higher bit rate codecs it held up well to editing.  The battery life is also amazing for a camera like this. My DSLR battery rarely lasts over an hour but I was able to shoot a whole wedding with the GH3 with a single battery.I shot all of my footage with the IPB codec at 50mbps at 24P.  The 50mbps was more practical for card space compared to the 72mbps All-I.  I did not have time to compare the image difference between IPB and All-I but I cannot imagine it would be much. I did test out the AVCHD codec however and there was a definite difference between this lower bit rate and IPB.  There were several obvious image artifacts with the AVCHD.  First was very noticeable moire on a brick wall, that was non-existent with IPB on the same wall.  There was also quite a bit of aliasing on several objects that was not there with the higher bit rate.  The AVCHD despite the compression artifacts still looked pretty good compared to other cameras I have shot with. If you are short on storage space the AVCHD is nice to have but I would recommend getting more SD cards and shooting everything in the higher bit rates.  The image quality is noticeably better and it is always best to capture in a higher bit rate so you have more room to edit the final image in post if needed.The one negative from a videographers standpoint is that there is no focus peaking.  I did not find this to be a big problem as my shots were in focus even when I was shooting wide open with the manual focusing Voightlander 25mm f0.95 lens. It helps that the sensor is a little smaller so depth of field is not as shallow as Super 35, APS-C, or Full Frame. Having said that the shallow depth of field with the right lens is still pretty darn impressive.  There are several lenses you can buy with this camera that will do autofocusing. I rented a 14-140 f4.0-5.6 lens that did this and the autofocus worked exceptionally well. Autofocusing eliminates the need for peaking but most serious videographers like manual focusing.  The best video lenses, like the Voightlanders, are manual so you adjust both aperture and focusing manually on the lens. This is more a pure cinema type lens like you would expect on a Hollywood film set.  The beauty with this camera is that you can choose any type or manufacturer of lenses with an adapter. I would recommend manual lenses for video but it is nice to have autofocus ones when you want to go run and gun.  Investing in an inexpensive monitor with focus peaking may be a good choice if you work with manual lenses all the time.This camera offers pretty much every frame rate you would want and even has some high frame rate options for slow motion.  There are few cameras out there today that offer all these options with this image quality. There are digital cameras for video that have larger dynamic range but they come with the cost of extra time for color correction and grading in post.  in addition there is a greater amount of storage space needed to handle the huge files which equates to a lot of money.  If you are looking for an easy to use video camera with awesome image quality that also does stills this should be at the top of you list.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mirror less beast.", "Author": "gatorheadLuis", "ReviewID": "R36I057GZ25C73", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I switched to this camera about 6 months ago when I decided to sell my D600 full frame camera and lenses. My main interest is travel and everyday family/friends photography.  While the D600 took phenomenal photos, combined with the lenses, it was annoying carrying around all the weight for travel/every day photography. That's when i started researching alternatives and bought an olympus epl5 to test out the micro four thirds system. That camera blew me away with it's quality/size combination. I was sold on micro four thirds after that and decided to get a gh3.6 months later I don't regret the move at all. This camera produces great photos, AMAZING video and has a user interface/experience that easily surpasses any digital SLR I have ever used.These are the things I enjoy the most about the camera. In no specific order.+ Image quality - you get awesome quality images IF you use quality glass. By quality glass I mean the 1.8 primes or 2.8 zooms. Also I generally don't shoot over ISO 3200 and prefer to stay at/under 1600 for best results.+ Touch screen focus - You can use the OLED screen to move your focus point around. This is incredibly convenient and even works when you have it pressed up to eye level and are using the electronic view finder. Makes moving the focus point extremely easy and a lot more enjoyable compared to DSLR methods.+ OLED SCREEN Flexibility - Screen is fully articulating. Meaning you can get shots by holding the camera way over your head and pointing the screen down for you to see or holding it way below and pointing the screen up for you to see... also remember, you can tap the screen to focuse on what you want while your shooting at these weird positions, so when you shoot, your shooting what you want to... your not spraying and praying.+ Custom functions - You can set 5 custom shooting modes that you can quickly dial to. Once you have these set up you can quickly get to how you want your camera to act in a matter of seconds.+ Weather sealing - I'm not going to go out shooting in a hurricane but if it starts to drizzle it's nice knowing that the camera I spent over a thousand dollars for can handle it.+ Build quality - I'm very careful with my equipment, but it's nice to know that the camera I spent over a thousand dollars on is built solid. 6 months of heavy use with it, zero build quality issues.+ Battery life - fantastic.+ Video, video, video - Video option/features are amazing on this camera. - I wasn't much into video before but now I probably shoot 60% stills 40% video. The ability to switch easily and effortlessly from video to stills and back makes it fun to shoot both. I dreaded shooting video on the D600 because it hindered my photography and the user experience wasn't all that great.+ Lenses - Your lenses are going to be smaller and lighter, meaning an overall more portable system.+ Wifi - Easily able to share photos by transferring to iPhone seconds after taking photos.+ 16 MP file is easy to work with size wise on the computer and pack enough punch for large prints.Finally things I would like changed on next model- There is only one card slot. I find myself wishing I had 2 slots like the D600. Find myself wanting this when I'm shooting high def video, not stills.- Image stabilization in body like EM5 - This is not an issue when I use my 2.8 zooms with built in stabilization but it can be with primes.That's it. - I love this camera. It's small enough that I can carry it daily in my backpack with a 2.8 12-35mm lens daily. Because I am more likely to have it with me I am using it a lot more and I've also become a much more creative person because of the video capability of this camera.I would recommend this camera to anyone, any day.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Game changer", "Author": "RalphB", "ReviewID": "R3A4B2PMQJF3ED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At work I shoot with Canon's D5 Mark III and a D7. Both take better photos than my GH3. However, when it comes to video, the GH3 blows those cameras out of the water. I've been shooting TV news for more than 25 years mostly with those pricey and heavy Sony and Panasonic shoulder mounts. I've always kept a decent, but not great video camera at home usually in the range of $4,000. This camera is not going to beat out video cameras in the $8,500 plus range, but it just destroyed the $3,500 - $8,500 market. Well let me qualify that. The middle of the pack professional video cameras can out-tweak the GH3, however the GH3 delivers a better image overall. Better in color provided it's manually white balanced. Absolutely better in detail. The Mark III will likely not lose its perch as the standard on Hollywood and high end production sets, but that's only for two reasons. 1. People are reluctant to change and tend to look around at others to see what they are using. Group think. 2. There is a legitimate reason professionals should be leery of buying it. The body is light, plastic and will not take the beating other photo cameras can and do. It's also critical to have decent lenses and they are not cheap. I've been using the 4/3 Leica, 25mm, f 1/4. Wee doggies. A lot of my work entails covering police/crime in the dark. All I can say is wow. I can't help but think Panasonic is back in the lab engineering a king-daddy version. Until that happens, perhaps it's good for the pros to hang tight. Let me end with this. I'm a cynical, cranky and even sarcastic user of cameras. Most are so overpriced it's not even funny. The Mark III is a perfect example. For a fraction of the price the Panasonic GH3 is absolutely stunning. For beginner and intermediate shooters, don't hesitate buying this camera, the learning curve is easy to moderate (another huge plus).

That's okay, I guess, in terms of them having major market share. So I bought the GH3 sight unseen, as you often have to with \"enthusiast\" products (which, by the way, is against my own moral code - I almost never buy high-end electronics sight unseen). 'Nuff about that.The camera is solid, it feels solid, not like a toy, and is what all other major review sites have stated - an awesome camera that can do both video and stills. While one may argue that it does okay stills, and excellent video, I'd have to respond by saying that yes, I'd agree. I think my Nikon D5100 produces better image quality right out of the camera (this is my subjective opinion, so please, no haters), I think that the GH3 is plenty good at producing images in good to great light, where my Nikon D5100 can do amazing things in low light. In every other respect, I find the GH3 superior to my Nikon D5100.  The only thing about the GH3 is the fiddly wheel on the back, I feel like it is unpredictable at times, and a similar comment was made by CameraStoreTV on YouTube.  Maybe we got the short end of the stick?I am shooting with this camera on a daily basis, and all I can say is that I really like it, and now my Nikon sits all alone.The bottom line is this, if you are a hybrid shooter, stills and video, pro or enthusiast, the GH3 makes hybrid shooting a lot easier than my Nikon D5100.This camera isn't for everyone, but it's the right one for me - a hybrid shooter that enjoys photography/videography to make lasting family memories.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent ergonomics, and the video capabilities rock!", "Author": "A. Garcia \"Just another photography nut.\"", "ReviewID": "R2JEA04XF1D53H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are a plethora of reviews out there for this camera, so I won't even attempt to write one that would likely be inferior,  So I'll focus (pun intended) instead on how the camera feels to me, especially in light of the fact that I sold off all of my Canon DSLR gear in favor of the micro 4/3rds format.First, one would think that downsizing from a full size DSLR (I had a Canon 7D) would be a major shock, and something that would take a long time to get accustomed to.  But that was not the case.  Panasonic has done an excellent job in all respects related to ergonomics.  The size and weight are just about perfect!  All of the important camera settings are easily reached while operating the camera.  One only needs to become acustomed to their placement.  Between myself and a good friend of mine who also embraced this camera and system, I've been able to try just about any lens Panasonic has.  All have felt great on this camera.  The balance between camera and lens is comfortable, functional, and easy in the hand.I've not found that the available grip is really necessary, although if you shoot heavily in the portrait orientation, you might want to consider it.  Adding it does add some extra weight, but it is still far, far less than a full size DSLR with an \"L\" (Canon) type premium lens.One thing I will say, and echoing what so many other reviewers have said, is that the video capabilities, and output, are spectacular.  What I most appreciate is the performance of the continuos auto focus.  Paired with the right lens, there is no \"hunting\" for focus.  It is smooth, acurate, and nearly seamless when focusing for instance, between one person in the forefront of a crowd, and one towards the rear.  I've used it with an inexpensive Sigma 30mm f/2.8 lens, and comapred it to a friend's Canon T4i, and where the T4i would continously hunt back and forth until it achieved focus lock, the GH3 moved smoothly and locked on it's first attempt.I'm still in a \"comparison\" mode with it between my old 7D, but so far, the GH3 has met all of my expectations, and continues to amaze me.  And if you're tired of schleping around all of your full size gear, The GH3 is the way to go.Edit 03/24/2013 - I just wanted to add that there are a couple of areas where the GH3 is lacking as compared to a full size DSLR (at least at the pro-sumer level).  As far as focus tracking goes, it is by no means as capable as a 7D or D7000.  Also, with multi-frame continuous shooting, the electronic viewfinder \"blacks out\" and displays the first frame in the sequence only, but this is something I was aware of when moving to the GH3. I find I do miss the continuous view the optical viewfinder gave me, as well as the 8FPS the 7D was capable of.Thus, there are trade-offs.  If you are considering a move to micro 4/3rds, try to borrow one from a friend, or at least rent one for a day of shooting.  You should try it out first.  While I don't regret the move, It would be nice to maintain both systems, if you could afford it.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect Indie Film Maker Camera", "Author": "Ruben Cruz", "ReviewID": "R27D5FGXTSILTH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Upgraded from GH2 and all my dreams have come true.

This really matters and makes it much easier to capture great video in a variety of situations. Panasonic has a long history with pro video and with small format video in the GH line. If you have to run and gun or change things on the fly the GH3 simply has a better workflow with faster, more intuitive, more flexible controls. For example the GH3 has a dedicated White Balance button that provides the instant ability to set the actual Kelvin temp and see the changes on the Live View screen. So it's fast and easy to visually set white balance or to creatively warm or cool the scene and know exactly how it will look.- Incredible selection of lenses. I sold my complete collection of Canon cameras and L lenses because I'm moving to the Micro Four Thirds format. The Panasonic 12-35mm 2.8 and 35-100mm 2.8 professional zooms are image stabilized and provide top image quality. If you combine that with the 25mm 1.4 prime from Panasonic and the 45mm 1.8 and 75mm 1.8 primes from Olympus you have an astonishingly powerful kit that fits into a small bag.- A professional quality Electronic Tele-converter feature that allows a 2x+ extension of the focal length of a lens without degradation in quality. This is not a digital zoom feature and effectively doubles the focal length options in your kit with no added weight or expense.- Great video codecs that provide excellent footage straight out of the camera and create files that respond very well to color grading or anything else in post.- Important video friendly features such as great audio, an audio monitoring jack, powerful and convenient color adjustment, fast and slow motion video in camera, unlimited video record times (limited only by the size of your SD card), etc.Panasonic and Olympus, along with a growing party of vendors supporting the MFT lens mount, are really breaking new ground in what's possible especially in the video realm.The GH3 is excellent for video and stills but if video is important I don't think there's another camera on the planet that could provide so much value for the cost.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Best Micro 4/3rds Camera Yet", "Author": "Peter P.", "ReviewID": "RR010MT10ITM9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the G1 as soon as it was released in 2008 because I believed then as I believe now that mirrorless cameras are the future of digital photography.  I did have one major complaint about the G1 -- it was too small.  The various buttons and controls were not only small but they were placed close together.  I could hold the camera firmly but a slightly larger camera would be more comfortable.Despite the improvements that were made to G and GH lines, I didn't upgrade because the size remained relatively the same (the G3 was a step backwards as far as I was concerned).I was delighted when the GH3 was announced.  The camera, at least on paper, answered my prayers.  When I was finally able to get one, almost 6 months after it was announced, I found that it was indeed the camera I had hoped for.The camera felt like it had been custom made for my hands.  The various controls were a good size and well placed.  With 7 programmable Function buttons and 5 Custom camera settings the camera can be easily configured to meet almost any need.The Image Quality is excellent.  Thus far I found the results up to 2000 ISO to be good and even at 3200 to be useable.  This camera has been compared to the Olympus OM-D (which I had the opportunity to test extensively last fall). Any differences in the images produced by these two cameras are, in my opinion, so small as to be meaningless.While my main interest is in Still Photography thus far I found the Video capabilities of this camera to be amazing.  I can understand why video fans have praised this camera so  much.To sum up, this is an extraordinary, flexible camera capable of producing superb results both as a still and as a video camera.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fits like a glove, Shoots like a pro", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3K1BVL899R45N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I orginally bought the Nikon D600, but after going through several of them due to dreaded oil spots and fast dust build up, I returned them. Nikon Tech support refused to acknowledge the problem whatsoever.. Sad really, as the camera until the spots showed up, was truly an outstanding camera. By the time I returned the last one, I was also getting tired of lugging around the camera and three pro (12-24, 24-70, & 70-200) lenses that combined was starting to feel like a boat anchor. I guess I am starting to feel my age (almost 60) and while I still wanted a very high quality camera system, I didn't want to carry that heavy boat anchor. I tried the Sony cameras like the Nex 7, Nex 6, RX100, and yes the RX1. Of the four I liked the RX1 the best followed by the RX100. The RX1 is a fantastic full frame camera, but I felt totally limited by the fixed focal (35mm) lenght of the lens. Other than that, the RX1 was an amazing shooter in my opinion. The real downside to me was the price of $2800. If you want any extra acessories like the EVF ($450), you had to pay extra for it and I think at that price, the acessories should have been included. So.. No... Thanks. The RX100 was to me another good camera, but it just didn't suit my style of shotting.The Sony Nex cameras didn't impress me at all. I felt that the rather limited native Nex lens selection left a lot to be desired. Plus I didn't want to buy an adaptor and start using the heavy leneses again. Next I tried the Olympus OM-D E-M5. This is a very nice camera, but the two that I had would overheat and lock up when using video. Another minor gripe that I had with the E-M5 was the lack of a real built in grip without having to buy the optinal add on grip. Another gripe I had was the limited range of motion fo the rear lcd screen. Other negatives to me, was the dinky included flash in which you have to remove a rear cover that exposes a secondary connector just to use the flash on the hotshoe. Uh huh...right. Why doesn't Olympus even include lens hood for their lenses? What's up with that? Okay, enought griping. On to the Panasonic GH3....  Right out of the box this camera fit my hand (somewhere between medium to large glove size) like the proverbial glove. I found all the buttons and controls easy to reach and use, with the exception of the rear lower control dial wihich is partially block on the 1-5 o'clock position. It is not a deal breaker at all, just a bit annoying. The rear lcd screen is fully articulating which is something I really wanted. Wi Fi is another bonus with the GH3. Although not the easiest wi fi to use and having a fairly weak signal, it still gets the job done. I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 along with the Panasonic Lumix Link app from the Google Play store and I can control the camera remotely in both stills and video fairly easiley. As a backup I waiting on the cable release that Panasonic sells for the GH3. Transfering photos to the phone and to the PC is rather slow, but again it worksl I have two lenses for the GH3 so far and they are both Panasonic. The first one is the  H-HS12035 X VARIO 12-35mm F2.8  and  the second is the H-HS35100  X VARIO 35-100mm F2.8. The 12-35mm  in 35mm speak is 24-70mm and the 35-100 in 35mm speak 70-200. These two lenses are very hight quality made lens and compared to the big full framed lenses very lightweight, but extremely well made.  If there was a lens from Pansonic in this family line that covered like say 6-12mm (12-24 in 35mm terms), I'd be thrilled. Who knows what Panasonic is up to in the lens department, as they do tend to listen to their customer a bit more than some other camera manufacturers i won't name. OH yes, Pansonic does include lens hoods and soft cases with these two lenses. So far in the two weeks that I've had the GH3 and lens setup, The quality of the photos have been very impressive to say the least considering that this is a 16.xx mega pixel sensor. The focusing speed is nothing short of amazing to me. It seems that no matter how quickly I move the camera around and take the picture, it is always totally in focus. Even shooting at night, the focusing capabilities are incredible. At present, I have very little time using the video portion of the camera. Battery life is pretty darn good too, in fact I find that it will last me for several days getting 600-700 shots before running ouf of juice. I also bought an extra battery just in case. I have not gotten the optional grip as I am still on the fence thinking whether I really want the extra bulk or not. I don't really shoot in vertical mode that much. I am also waiting for ReallyRightStuff guys to manufacture both a standard plate and a vertical plate to sue with my RRS TQC-14 tripod and RRS BH-30 Ballhead (a perfect comob btw for the GH3). I throughly enjoy carrying the much lighter GH3 around with me compared to the Nikon D600. I also have a lot of help in the form of a  BlackRapid Sport strap. I think the BlackRapid Straps are among the best out there. The CameraLabs webiste has a review up now on the GH3. You can also find a few reviews on Youtube as well. Panasonic Austrialia (AU) website has a series of user tips and how tos for getting the best out of your stills and video. I bought a half dozen filters from Amazon  made by B+W in the form of ND 101-102-103-110, clear uv protection filters, and lastly a polarizer filter. The lenses uses 58mm filter btw. I also gave Lee Filter a look, but decide to hold on for now as I think for my purpose they are bulky and add a lot of visibilty to the camera out in public. I still might look into the Lee Filter five7 system for mirrorless cameras and try them out. To sum up, I am really impressed with the capabilities of the weather sealed Panasonic GH3 and my two lens. It is a very fast shooter with most of the controls you need to use and change right at your fingertips. Size and weight wise, I couldn't have asked for a better camera system to hold in my hands and to carry around. Now if only these were third party user guides (other than the original owners manual) in Ebook format for the GH3 for all of us new owners, that would be icing on the cake.", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Pics.

The GH3 surpasses its predecessor in dynamic range and color reproduction, and has a cleaner noise output from 800 and 1600 iso. The file output is more edit-friendly as the .mts files of the GH2 can cause \"snowing\" in some editing programs, depending on the hack installed on that camera. Also, the .mov files from the GH3 are compatible with the audio-sync program Plural Eyes which is an absolute lifesaver. Making files from the GH2 compatible requires conversion using 5DtoRGB, which is time-consuming and takes up considerably more file space.Other considerations:- the battery life is fantastic - I've shot 8 hour days on just two batteries- the 1080/60p slow mo is fantastic - streets ahead of the 720/60p slow motion standard to most DSLRs- cleaner preamps and audio than the GH2, which is outfitted with the more standard 3.5mm connector- sharp image - I've been able to intercut footage from the GH3 with footage from the Blackmagic Cinema CameraThe only drawback I've seen with the GH3 after considerable use is that, unlike the GH2, fine-line patterns can cause aliasing and moire (something I've almost never seen with the GH2).

I like it.  A 2nd control dial, and buttons for direct access to things like exposure compensation, have made a big positive difference in the shooting experience.  True, it's a little bigger than the GH2, but I don't mind that.  Image quality is very good, and I appreciate the extra dynamic range of this sensor.  Much of the time I can recover highlights from a single exposure, rather than having to resort to exposure bracketing as I did with the GH2.  Battery life is excellent, and the LCD is first-rate.The LVF, however, is a step backward.  Those of us who wear glasses pretty much have to look straight ahead for an undistorted view.  And colors, particularly reds, are not accurately displayed at all.  I live with it by reviewing shots after-the-fact on the LCD.A few minor dislikes - the battery charger has a cord for the mains, the USB cable is really short, and you can't make \"yes\" the default selection when you want to delete an image.All-in-all, however, this is a good camera and a worthy upgrade if you can get it for less than $1,000.  I strongly suggest that you download the 'advanced user guide' in order to take full advantage of all the camera's setting.I also want to add a positive review for Amazon Warehouse Deals, which is where I bought this camera at a $200+ discount to the 'new' price.

The performance and image quality were great, and I could go really high ISO without too much noise. Afterwards I decided to buy a GH3 for myself to start shooting more often.  Coming from the 5D I thought I might be spoiled and dislike the GH3, but quite the opposite.  I'm enjoying it more.VIDEO: It may seem like a small thing but for me the swivel screen is amazing.  I shoot a lot of tight spaces/awkward angles, and with the 5D I was hurting my back trying to see the screen, or even messing up the shot tilting the camera so I could see what I was shooting.  An external monitor would have fixed that of course, but I'm doing things on the cheap. The video image quality is comparable to the 5D, except when you get to ISO 800 and above, then the 5D wins... but this camera is a fraction of the price.  The GH3 also has 1080p 60fps while the 5D does not.STILL: I came from a GF1 and wanted to keep my lenses so this upgrade made sense. I'm happy with video but it has surpassed my expectations as a still camera as well. The low light raw performance is great(at least a huge improvement from the GF1), and when you click down the shutter it responds immediately like a pro DSLR.  It just feels great to use.  Maybe these improvements just came with time in the Lumix series, but either way I'm happy.

First thing I did was get the battery in the charger. By the time it was charged it was late so I played with it, trying to become comfortable with the changes in the handling from the GH2.When I got my GH2 it instantly felt right in my hands coming from the GF1, not the same with the GH3. A lot of this has to do with the fact that the GH2 was my first \"SLR\" style camera, but some has to do with the GH2 being a nice machine. I didn't really know photography when I got the GH2 so I was starting from scratch, moving to the GH3 I lost all the familiarization from a layout standpoint.I left the house at 6:30 to take my wife to work and forgot my bag so everything I shot this morning was with the Panny 25. I tend to shoot RAW and manual but I did switch to JPG for a couple of HDR shots to see how I like it. I have not been impressed with the EM5 HDR shots as they just look like typical \"overcooked\" HDR shots.EVF I did spend some time toying with the EVF last night, but it was dark and I didn't worry about how it looked. I seemed to get the smearing but mostly when in the menu mode on the edges if I moved my eye around. Didn't notice much in live mode, but again it was very dark. This morning in daylight I had no issues at all with the EVF image other then it seemed a tad dark at times. If there is distortion of some kind it is very minimal in the conditions I was shooting in today. I do shoot almost excessively EVF.HDR I only tried a couple but was happy with the results. One of them had ghosting so you have to stay very steady when using it, but I guess that's kinda assumed.  In the 4 shots below 3 are HDR and one is not to show the difference. All of the shots in this post are RAW with only LR4.3 defaults applied except for a little straitening on a few. The HDR are JPG because it can't do RAW and were processed the same. I see the HDR feature this being very useful at times.After the 2 hours I was starting to get the feel for the camera but have a long way to go before I'm as comfortable with it as I am with (my wife's new to her) GH2. The pull out menu on the screen is kind of cool but will take getting used to. EXP. compensation button is a waste and I wish I could reprogram it. I'm sure I'll move some of the settings around to different buttons as I figure out which ones are easier to access and what I use the most.Level tool \ufeffI used this on a few shots and I'm not sure if I like it or not yet. I use the grid on my GH2 and that seems to work fairly well. This was almost like trying to level a plane in a flight simulator and a little disorienting. I'll keep using it until I decide if it's better then the grid lines.Buttons and dials I was a little worried about how the buttons and dials would feel/function after hearing people talk about the EM5 being squishy. I've found very little difference from the feel and handling of the GH2 controls so it is not an issue. The wheel is hard to press (oh yeah you can't) but other then that it's all good. I have not found a use for the third wheel on the back and to be honest I miss the 4 buttons that are on the GH2. You can still click them but I don't see where you can program a function to them and that is a shame. Maybe that can change with a FW update. I would welcome the addition with one being for flash comp like on my GH2.Electronic shutter This seems to work fine. I was wondering why my ISO would not go above 1600 and on the ride home I remembered that if the ES is on ISO is limited. That is why there are only shots up to 1600.All in all I think I'm going to really like the camera. I have not done any IQ evaluations and have barely looked at the shots I am posting. It will take a month or two to get used to the changed control positions and the extra dial but that is expected.Again, all the shots today except the 3 HDR were shot RAW and everything was run through LR4.3 defaults to convert and or resize for web use with no other post except leveling a couple.I chose to shoot at this old abandoned mall because of all the windows and drastic contrasts. The tropical sun can be very harsh when coming into some of these dark rooms.If you made it through my ramblings I hope you didn't find it a waste of your time, because you can't get it back...Images available at,  [...]", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best value for money video-stills hybrid.", "Author": "Daniel Moreno", "ReviewID": "R1YLW8PY87YHRH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What's not to love?

I've used some of the best rigs available at their time to film wildlife documentary footage. A few short years ago, digital SLR (DSLR) cameras began to also shoot video. With the larger sensor size of these smaller-than-professional-quality, dedicated video camcorders, a new era of very affordable, high-quality videography began. In addition, we early adopters finally had the shallow depth-of-field which had been the domain of high-quality DSLR still photographers and motion picture camera operators.My first video-enabled DSLR was the Canon t2i, which was a darn good camera with pretty good video capabilities. I kept hearing about the Panasonic GH2 as one of the big surprises among DSLR video shooters. It is a smallish camera with one thing I appreciated (among many)...a live electronic viewfinder (EVF). Not as good as the EVF's on the video camcorders I used to shoot a few years ago, but those cost several times more than my GH2 camera! I bought the GH2, sold the Canon and have been very happy with that decision.The Panasonic GH3 is now the flagship camera of the Lumix line and it is a beauty. Magnesium body (feels really solid), better video and stills quality than the already-very good GH2, much better video recording codecs, expanded ISO perfromance, all sorts of customizable function buttons. And for me, a wildlife shooter, the electronic tele-converter (ETC) allows me to increase the focal length of the lens on the camera by a factor of 2.4x. Since the micro four-third sensor of this GH3 has a 2x crop-factor upon the image as compared to a full-frame camera, the effective power of a 400mm lens is now 800mm. Using the 2.4 ETC makes the 400mm lens with 2x crop-factor a whopping 1920mm!!! When using the ETC, there is no loss of resolution or light. It IS NOT digital zoom. Bummer, when using the ETC, 60fps shooting is not available, only 30 or 24fps. Don't know if that can be upgraded through a firmware fix, but 60fps when using the ETC would've been a great perk, it is by no means a deal breaker.Plus, it's got wi-fi, so I can take a picture of a critter, send that picture to my iPhone and share it as soon as I want to with as many people as I please. Not a can't-do-without feature, but such a fun thing to have. Pretty sure it'll become valuable with clients. Also, you can use this wi-fi function to remotely trigger your camera using your smartphone or tablet. That is a very cool thing to have for me, a nature shooter who sometimes needs to be away frommy camera when filming skittish creatures. Sadly, at this time, this remote shoot function does NOT allow remote stoppage of video recording- you gotta physically go to the camera and stop it manually. Hope that gets ironed out in a firmware update soon.I have had this camera for a few days now and absolutely love the quality of the camera itself, but more importantly, the video and still images it produces.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best micro 4/3 body I've used (so far), but Amazon has a stupid policy.", "Author": "Brian Woodbury \"TheStonerGuy\"", "ReviewID": "R1BP88L0Y9J02W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was the most I'd ever spent for just a camera body (in the digital age), and Robin and I took this, along with a G5KK body, an Olympus E-Pm2 body and a bunch of lenses to Dallas for the \"Texas Frightmare Weekend\".

The way the buttons are placed, and the size of the camera itself - not too tiny to hold, this was a joy to use. The weird downside was when we returned from the weekend journey I saw that Amazon had dropped the price by $100 so I checked to see if I could get a $100 refund-or-Amazon card worth $100 and I received (very quickly) a responce via email that it was past the 7-day mark and the Amazon agent suggested I return the body I purchased for a refund, then turn around and re-purchase the body for $100 less.This doesn't make a lot of sense for Amazon to have me go through this (after all, they're paying shipping back'n forth), and it would seem to their benefit to just credit me the $100 and let it go at that. I haven't decided if I'll follow their advice or not - the body I received is already programmed to my liking, and I know it works great. What if I return it and get another body that for one reason or the other doesn't match up to my opinion of the one I now have?

Most will auto focus at a slow speed, although some focus more quickly than on the Olympus E-1 in all but bright light.  The Leica/Panasonic 25mm f/1.4 for Four-Thirds even allows use of the aperture ring.

The electronic viewfinder takes some acclimation, and the auto review setting needs to be turned off to be able to see what's actually happening through the viewfinder or the rear display.Various other settings need some experimentation.  The Standard photo style may be okay, but I use Natural, and I've seen others use Portrait.  It's important to experiment so that you get the shadows and highlights that you want without the iDynamic feature (artificial dynamic range expansion).I was initially concerned about the single SD card slot, but a 32 GB card gives me an indicated 1603 raw files at maximum resolution.As is prudent, I would recommend an extra battery.  The battery grip may be of use to you but I don't have one to balance the heavier ZD lenses and I'm not having a problem.  It only takes one battery, so I'm not sure it's of much help.I'm pleased with the image quality, even at ISO 3200.Focus issues to note: If you're accustomed to using manual focus, as I am, you may find the native micro Four-Thirds lenses too small to be used easily.  Also, the manual focus assist helps you by magnifying the area you're trying to focus.  If you have a group of runners, it's helpful but you to follow and focus is difficult, unlike using an SLR and optical viewfinder.  As with any current mirror-less camera body, you'll find that continuous auto focus does not work well.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "This camera is fantastic.", "Author": "BboyTrainerRed", "ReviewID": "R2HUZMYC7LBREX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is my pride and joy. This camera is my first expensive, modern camera and i have quickly fallen in love with it. I bought this camera for film purposes and the quality is just magnificent. To top all that off, i was afraid when buying a modern expensive camera due to not knowing how everything works. However, with all the buttons and simple menus, this camera is great for beginners like me and for people who know what they are doing. I heard one review say this is the best camera that you can buy for under $3,000 and i believe it (this may have changed since the gh4 came out). Anyways, although i'm still learning, this camera puts out fantastic quality before i even figured out all the things like iso, whitebalance, exposure, shutterspeed, etc. I bought it with a 20mm f1.7 lens (a great \"first lens\") and the camera's \"Ex. Tele Conv.\" function makes it as though i have two separate lenses, which saves me some time effort from needing to buy more lenses. Owning one lens with this camera is like owning two. The camera also comes with a wifi setting which can do multiple things, but the only two that i know of are \"Uploading photos straight to your computer\" and \"Remote control through smart phone\" I think the remote control through smart phone is really cool. It is very limited in its control but it is a good thing when you are filming a scene where you are acting and you need to make sure the cameraman has the look right. I thought the camera was REALLY pricey when considering buying it, but after watching all the great reviews for it, i knew i had to own it and i am so glad i bought it. I think it is worth every penny. I recommend this camera to beginners and novices.

I was looking for something to bridge the gap between my K-5 and my FZ150--and probably replace one of them.  I wanted, at a minimum:* 6-8fps burst shooting.  Just made it at 6fps.* Decent burst depth (fast shooting is meaningless if you can't capture at least 3-4 seconds of action).  The GH3 can capture about 20 RAW (Panny says 18; one reviewer got 24) and up to 100 or more JPEGs.  Check.* Good video options.  Check.* Reasonable size, weight and price.  Check.  I got the body new for under $1000 (could this be because of the E-M1, or is a GH4 just over the horizon?).* Decent selection of lenses.  Check.  I got a 14-140mm (walk-around), a 100-300mm (distance), and a power zoom 45-175mm (for video zoom).  These lenses are a lot less expensive than Olympus lenses, and they have I.S. in lens.  I never use dedicated lenses anymore because I miss too many shots that are out of range.  I'm willing to sacrifice some IQ and hope to make it up in PP.  If I don't get the shot, the IQ is zero.* And, of course, good resolution and IQ.  The GH3 rated well with DxOMark and just about everyone else; very slight differences from the competition (including the E-M1) were not enough to justify any hesitation, and the video features put it well ahead of most.----------------First impressions & good things* Bigger than I expected, especially after the E-M1 (which I ditched due to abysmal video quality).  It's a good fit, easy to hold and manage.  Solid feel and grip.* Not too heavy.  470g, vs. 442g. for the E-M1; a GH3 with a Panny 14-140mm weighs a few grams more than an E-M1 with an Oly 14-150mm.* Nice eyepiece.* Diopter has wide range and is well-located--not likely to get nudged by accident.* EVF is bright and clear.* Fully articulated screen is a plus.  Not only adjusts to any angle, but folds in flat to save the screen.* Good layout of levers, dials and buttons; although the location of the On/Off lever next to Mode dial seem a bit odd, but OK.* In Movie Mode, you can use the shutter button to start filming.  I have always liked this about Panasonic--it fits what you're used to from still photography; one less thing to learn, one less button to fumble for, one less potential mistake to make.  This also lets you use a variety of remote shutter devices.* Optional remote shutter releases (wireless and wired, with or without timer) can be used to shoot stills or video (video in Movie Mode).  WiFi isn't necessary.* Plenty of programmable buttons for your favorite functions.* It is good to have a number of dedicated buttons and dials for various functions.  Saves time and guesswork.* Dedicated dial for Bracketing/Burst shooting/Timer.  Quick, good location.* Dedicated lever for MF/AFC/AF-S/.  Quick, good location.* Dedicated video button (you also can use the shutter release, in Movie Mode).* Dedicated buttons for WB, ISO, Exposure compensation.* Dedicated button for LVF.  You can avoid involuntary switching between EVF and screen by turning off the auto function and just using the button.* The buttons for WB, ISO and Exposure Compensation are close to the \"front\" wheel (which actually is on top).  This is a trade-off: you can work these buttons quickly, since once activated the \"front\" wheel is used to adjust them.  It's also fairly easy to accidentally active one while feeling for the wheel (using EVF, obviously).  Time will create better skills.* The I.S. in the lens seems far superior to the in-body I.S. of the E-M1.  Using comparable zoom lenses, I find the GH3 image to be rock-solid in the viewfinder (175mm and 300mm, hand held; shutter at anywhere from 1/400 to 1/800).  Unlike the E-M1, it was no effort to keep the crosshairs of the VF on the target.* The point focus is very nice--temporarily zooms your view so that you can be sure the focus is right on.  It's a bit disconcerting at first...but you can go ahead and press the shutter while it's still in the zoom view; it will take the picture that you composed.* RAW files (RW2) can quickly be converted to DNG using free, stand-alone Adobe DNG Converter.  This avoids having to clutter up the computer with clunky software.  DNG can be processes with a wide variety of programs (for previewing RW2, I use free FreeStone image viewer, which not only lets you view your images, but displays EXIF data on the right side of the viewing screen.* Image quality is, obviously, hugely dependent on what glass you're using.  So far I've had a chance to do some basic shooting.  With the 45-175mm, the quality is just as good as what I got with a roughly comparable Olympus lens on the E-M1.  JPEGs aren't over-processed; they're a little soft when shooting long distance, but that can easily be remedied in PP.  Colors are very true to life and detail is excellent.  With the 100-300mm lens fully zoomed, the JPEGs were actually superior to the RAW files, indicating very good NR and sharpening settings.  Under certain circumstances, I may be shooting more JPEGs than in the past.* Comparing shots of the same subjects at the same distance (about 1400 yards), the GH3 with either the 45-175mm or the 100-300mm produced images with IQ comparable to, and in some instances better than those generated by a K-r and a K-5 (both DSL-Rs) with a Pentax 55-300mm lens.  (DxOMark scored all three lenses as roughly equal; this is a reasonably fair test of the cameras.)  The images were also comparable to those generated by the E-M1 with an Olympus MFT 75-300mm lens (rated the same as the Panasonic lenses).* Extended Tele Converter feature is incredible for video!  This isn't a \"digital zoom\" but rather a sort of crop--the camera uses the 1920x1080px at the center of the frame for capture.  The result is a roughly 2mp image that is actually superior in IQ to taking a full size 16mp image and doing a crop and resize of the same area with PhotoShop.  The resolution is amazing.  This is a great tool for dramatically extending your zoom range when shooting video.  It also works with still images, but only with the capture set at 8mp JPEG (fine is OK).  In this case the \"magnification\" is far less: the 175mm lens has a normal 35mm equivalent of 350mm; the ETC bumps this up to 498mm.  (In video, due to the far smaller 2mp area, the equivalent is something like 600mm.)Not so good:* Seems you can't do a timed burst shoot.  This is a very obvious requirement in many situations.  Work-around: use a remote shutter release and start the burst when you're ready.  But still...* The 20fps burst is not full resolution--which would be OK, but the manual makes a point of not telling you this on the page devoted to burst shooting.  They do tell you that you can't shoot RAW at this rate.  Fair enough.  But the fact that the 20fps burst images are only 4mp is not revealed in the section on burst shooting.  To find that information, you have to search the manual and finally you'll find the info on p.160, with information about user options for aspect ratios.* EVF could be higher resolution.  Also fonts of EVF display seem to be subject to edge replication at certain angles.  A minor complaint.* You can set Fn buttons to your preferred functions--choose 1 of 40 options for each.  But for whatever reason, Fn4 is limited to a very few options (9).  So if you have worked your way down to Fn4, assigning buttons as you go, you'll probably have to go back and reassign in order to accommodate the functions you want to the limited choices for Fn4.  Firmware fix, please?* No built-in ND filter.  There may be a valid reason for this omission (interfere with some other function?), but in a camera at this price point I don't know what it is.* Limited choice of focal point setups.  It would be nice to be able to select the points or a cluster of points.  What you have is \"face,\" all points, central area, spot (in center).* Coming from a pre-WiFi era, the first thing I did was ignore the WiFi and reassign the button.  But it seems there are some issues with WiFi shooting.  So use a remote (wired or wireless).* I've bought a power zoom lens for video; it has a switch on the lens.  I would prefer a P&S-style; zoom lever right next to the shutter button.  Everything in one place, just a touch of the finger, no need to shift your hand around and possibly jiggle the camera.  I will probably try an add-on zoom lever on my other lenses; some people swear by them for smooth video zooming.  If it works I'll send back the power zoom.  UPDATE: the power zoom lens (45-175mm) is not only smooth, it has great IQ.  I'll keep it and forget about the add-on zoom lever.* No zebra.  Bad for those who rely on it; I've always gotten good results with my own judgment and a histogram if I need it.  (An interesting comment was made by a documentary filmmaker to the effect that the camera picks up more detail than you expect in shadows; good DR means less worries about pinpoint precision on exposure.)* Lens caps should come with a string attached.  Small distractions and delays add up to big ones and missed shots (or lost lens caps).Flat-out bad* With the 100-300mm lens attached, AF is extremely erratic.  Single AF may simply fail to focus--it doesn't even hunt, it just blurs the entire display and quits trying.  This is the worst AF I have ever used.  This hasn't happened with the 45-175mm lens.* The LCD display screen is totally useless if you have bright sunlight behind you--which of course is often if you're shooting outdoors away from the sun.* UPDATE: I previously stated that one could not view AVCHD 60p video, taken with the GH3, in the GH3.  I also noted that others had reported this problem online.  In my case, it turned out that the SDHC card was faulty.  I can't say what the issue was with the others.* No matter whether you're using the screen or the EVF, the on-screen information display turns off after about 10 seconds.  This is really dumb.  Apparently there is no way to change this (except to make it turn off even sooner, which would be even dumber).  I know that Panasonic is capable of making cameras that don't have this dumb design defect, because I've owned some (including the FZ150).  One can only hope that they issue a firmware fix.  Meanwhile, you have to fiddle a dial or button to make the display come on again--for another ten seconds.  Can you imagine a TV set that turned the picture off every ten seconds?  This is a known problem (people have been complaining about it since 2012, but I was hoping that later firmware might have fixed it).  I sent in a support request to Panasonic, detailing the issue.  They emailed me that this needed live body attention, and gave me a number to call.  The support person (as usual) was alive but clueless and clearly reading from a menu of \"support\" steps: remove the battery, wait, put the battery back; reset to factory default; etc.  Naturally, none of this had any effect.  My case has now been escalated.  SUGGESTION: if you own this camera or are considering buying it, contact Panasonic (either pre-purchase product information or support) and raise this issue.  If they get enough complaints they will probably issue a firmware upgrade to change this dumb non-feature (if for no other reason than to cut down on staff costs incurred in responding to the complaints).  Griping in forums and in reviews is pointless, and takes at least as much time as a simple message to Panasonic.  If Amazon deletes the address I will try to rewrite it in a different way:  shop dot panasonic dot com slash ecom slash support slash contact-us.* Power zoom via camera arrow pad: this is a great idea, and it works really well.  Instead of fumbling with the power zoom lever on the lens (if you have a power zoom lens), you can activate power zoom via the camera body, zooming in and out with the L/R arrows.  You can even zoom faster by using the Up/Down arrows.  So why have I put this convenient feature in the \"Flat-out Bad\" section?  Well, remember how the info display shuts off after 10 seconds?  This also turns off the power zoom in body feature.  To get it going again, you have to turn it on again, then use it.  But if you quit using it for more than 10 seconds, it will turn itself off again.  Imagine a TV remote that would automatically shut down after 10 seconds of watching the same channel, and had to be re-activated to change channels or increase/decrease the volume.  It's interesting to note that the level indicator, a true non-conformist, stays resolutely on, even after everything else on the info display goes dark and the zoom shuts off.  You may be flying blind, but at least you know you're straight and level.Naturally as soon as I got the camera and lenses, the weather got bad.  I don't think anything shot while sitting around in the living room or shooting out into the fog and clouds says much about the camera's performance, IQ, etc.  I always test a new camera under normal conditions because that's when I do my shooting.  I will have more to say about the camera's performance and results when I can do some shooting in decent conditions.  NOTE: later in the day, I was able to do some basic shooting; results have been incorporated above.  I'll do more in the next couple of days, and some video.UPDATE: I have been able to do some shooting in good, sunny conditions with both the 45-175mm power zoom and the 100-300mm zoom.  The results are incorporated into the review.  I found IQ to be very good, video quality outstanding, no jello with AVCHD or MOV, 60p or 30p, colors are very good.  I followed flying birds, moving fishing boats, waves, people and a pigeon stalking crumbs in the park.  All good results.  One oddity with single AF: if I focused on a very distant subject (several hundred yards away) and then zoomed in, the subject went out of focus.  However, if I zoomed in, got the focus, then zoomed back out and began to video, I could zoom in and out to my heart's content without losing focus.  I thought infinity was infinity, but...-------------------------Bottom line: as with anything in life, the key question is \"what's the alternative?\"  If I thought there was something better out there at a price I could afford/justify, I'd buy it.  If it's there, I'd love to know about it--I did a lot of research before ordering the GH3 (and more research while waiting for it to arrive).  But nothing I could find has the combination of reasonable size and weight, burst speed, burst depth, good video, good choice of lenses, IQ and other qualities that the GH3 has.  Having said this, the issues with the video reviewing and the info shutoff--both of which are absurd and neither of which is made clear in advance by Panasonic--are a constant irritation and a hindrance to smooth operation.  And the AF issue when shooting with the 100-300mm zoom lens was a very unpleasant surprise.  Still, the question is, what's the alternative?  The video is great, the other lens I have (the 14-140mm is still back-ordered) is great, and the IQ (including the IQ of the 100-300mm when I get it to focus) is excellent.  I'll check on firmware updates that may do a better job of harmonizing the body and the 100-300mm lens.If you want a sample of what this camera can do with video, Google \"Shooting Angels with the Panasonic GH3 in Mexico.\"  Be sure to watch the trailer.

I was pleased with the results I achieved, overall image quality more or less on a par with image quality from a cheaper Olympus OM-DEM-5, and of semi professional quality. While this camera will greatly appeal to videographers ( at this price point there's little competition ), I must point out that the EVF ( electronic viewfinder ) was terrible, and focussing in low light was erratic. The EVF I found worse than the EVF on a \u00a3450 Fujiflm XS-1, and worse than the EVF on a \u00a3280 Fujifilm HS30exr. It just flickered. For this reason I can only award the camera 3 stars. Since it's release Nikon have launched the D7100, also cheaper and, with a larger sensor,capable of producing better results especially at high iso settings. the D7100 is a DSLR with a pentaprism. The viewfinder is therefore optical. Focussing is faster too, but video is poor by comparison with the GH3. So avoid the GH3 unless you've tried the EVF and know you can live with it, or unless you're specifically purchasing as a videographer. But then why would you not prefer to use a dedicated video camera? Still not sure? Compare the EVF with the one on a Fujifilm X100, or later X100S to see what I'm getting at. The EVF on the X100/X100S can be switched to optical, so you can directly compare the difference between an electronic and an optical viewfinder on the same camera. Then have another look at the EVF on the GH3. It's simply not up to standard in the experience of this reviewer.", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera Died on First Field Use.

Not for experienced video users. Crippled.", "Author": "AmazonMember", "ReviewID": "RP16FJ1R2BJI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've tried to like this camera but after 2 weeks of usage, I've reset any expectation of achieving that.For all the chest beating about this camera being designed for video, it's crippled by poor ergonomics. The IQ is excellent but so are other cameras in this category so in that sense I'll call the IQ excellent.  IMHO, the design smacks of decisions made by people that don't know video. Case in point is you can't monitor audio with headphones (mandatory for anyone who knows) when the LCD is open (also mandatory for anyone who knows cameras on tripods are not at 90 degrees to eye height).Worse is the inability (as of this writing) to keep the data display on for more than 10 seconds (independent of recording or not). I've read a Panasonic marketing manager said it's to prevent burn in. It's my screen, if I want to burn it out to get the recording I require, it's mine to do. I should have the option. Panasonic picked a screen that burns in and is not fit for purpose, not me.Third is there is no Tally light (indication that the camera is recording) if you close the screen to save battery. None. Zero. Zip. The recording can fill up the card and you are none the wiser.Then there's the inability to stop recording over wifi,  no focus peaking, no zebras ... unbelievable.It's a joke of a camera for noob filmaker wannabes.UPDATE:Another problem with the design of the GH3 that I encountered as have others is the inconsistent record button.  What should be a great feature for a hybrid camera (aka the ability to smack a dedicated record button to record video), the GH3 design suffers in that sometimes it doesn't record.  It's apparently tied to the disappearing overlay displays. If you press the record button before the overlay displays disappear (10 seconds), the record button works. If it's after they disappear, the record button DOES NOT record, it only makes the overlays display. Pressing it a second time starts recording.  But you can't just get used to pressing it twice. If the first press is within that 10 seconds the displays are on, it will start recording and the second tap of the button will stop recording. So you get a second of recorded material and miss the shot.  The work around we're all using for this is to disable the record button and use the shutter button to control recording. Unless Panasonic fixes it in firmware, it's a wasted feature and makes me wonder about Panasonic designers and product managers. Hopefully this and the displays issue will be fixed in firmware.UPDATE 2:Last I used the camera, I found another flaw/bug in it's design. The Custom Settings don't work properly. Custom settings are long a professional feature and were one of the reasons I chose the GH3 over other cameras. Custom settings let you set the shooting settings ahead of time, save them and switch to them instantly. As an example, it's handy in a hybrid camera to have a Custom Setting for video where the shutter speed is a function of the recording format and unlike photography, isn't something in the exposure triangle you manipulate when exposing a shot. Canon cameras implement the function beautifully, The GH3 implementation of the custom settings however doesn't store the aperture, shutter etc. It stores the mode [insert twirling finger] but the aperture and shutter are whatever they were for the last thing you were doing. That's ridiculous.EPILOG: As a stills camera, the lack of an LCD that shows your basic exposure settings at a glance is yet another Panasonic design flaw that makes the GH3 laughable. There's do discreetly checking/changing your aperture, ISO, WB or shutter speed. All the fiddling with the display or drawing it to your face simply takes away from the fun and creative process of photography and coming home with a boatload of great shots. Once again, a lack of design prowess by Panasonic.  IMHO, it's simply a consumer camera. None of the key complaints about the GH3 Firmware were fixed in Panasonic's latest Firmware update. It's clear they have no interest in the camera and have moved development to other products. All told, I recently sold the GH3 and lenses. It was a poor camera purchase. Glad to see it go.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "I bought this camera for the superior video quality, but gave it up due to tiny size/weight, and how it works for stills.", "Author": "Stephanie", "ReviewID": "RHB2R9KPGQCG4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If the Canon DSLR's are still cameras first, with video as an afterthought, the GH3 is a video camera first with stills function as an afterthought.I am a videographer and photographer, and was previously using the Canon 60D with APS-C sensor.  I wanted to upgrade for better video quality, and after seeing some test footage with the GH3, I was very interested in switching to this platform with the video friendly features and minimal aliasing compared to the new Canon 6D.When the camera arrived, I was unpleasantly surprised to see how small it is and how light it felt.  My Canon 60D and the 18-135mm kit lens felt substantial and more like a professional tool, unlike the GH3 that felt like a toy.  Not only that, but the micro 4/3 lenses are tiny also; I bought a 14-45mm and 7-14mm MFT lenses, and they both seemed too small and dainty - didn't add a good weight for nice handling.Perhaps people with less arm strength would appreciate the size and weight of the GH3, but I'm 6'1\" and it looks like a toy camera in my hands, and people (read: prospective clients) tend to judge your ability by how big your tool is (pun moderately intended).The video quality is truly wonderful to see, but the low light performance was disappointing, and the light weight of the camera means that shooting hand held looked particularly shaky.I didn't realize how much I missed the top sided lcd indicator with shutter speed, iso, aperture and light meter display until it was gone, as well as the more traditional full light meter that is superimposed to the viewfinder on a Canon - I didn't like looking at the EVF, with the light meter only displaying portions of the -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ,3 graph, instead of the whole thing like on a Canon.Shooting stills didn't feel like a primary function of this camera - it felt delayed from the shutter button press to the sensor exposing.  The responsiveness of the GH3 versus my old Canon was much less snappy.The menu system is crowded and suffers from too many sub-pages that must be scrolled vertically to see.  Canon's menu layout is simpler, with only horizontal scrolling and less menu pages overall.Lastly, the buttons on the GH3 are tiny and difficult to manipulate sometimes.  For instance, the video record button is very flat against the body, and really requires a hard push to activate.  The rear facing scroll wheel for aperture adjustment was partially recessed into the body, so full turns with one finger aren't possible - odd choices.The final annoyance was with the video start and stop delay.  I ran a test where I pressed record and immediately started counting (very fast) from 0 to 30 and press the record-stop button on 30.  When I played back the clip, the video began capturing when I was saying 3, and stopped when was saying 24.  Practically speaking, this could annoy actors or talent that have to wait just a few seconds longer before and after each take.In the end, I returned the GH3 for the Canon 6D - a much pricier camera, but a better tool for what I need.  For those interested more in video applications, the GH3 creates wonderful video, but for people like me who do both stills and video, the form and function of the camera was too much of a trade off.edit: removed extra word", "Date": "May 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": "Full Area Touch Control Auto Focusing\nCinematic Full HD Video 1080/60p (H.264)\nRuggedized Splash and Dust Proof Diecast Body for Ultimate Reliability\nHigh Speed Contrast AF Accuracy\nBuilt in Wi-Fi and double OLED Display", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH3K 16.05 MP Digital Single Lens Mirrorless Camera with 3-Inch OLED - Body Only (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41CdOmS-HYL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009B0WREM"}}
