So far I love it.  I have been trying for a few years to find a camera that compares to the Panasonic DMC-FZ50 I have used for about 6 years and taken over 360,000 photos with.  I also have a Canon T3i, but don't like it nearly as well as I like my FZ50.  The FZ200 seems to be just what I have been searching for.  It has new and updated features from my FZ50 and it has the 3\" rotating LCD screen.  I am optimistic that this is the camera I have been searching for ... can't wait to use it for some of my photo shoots.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "jbclarke394", "ReviewID": "R1GUTWK3AVV29L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My ONLY complaint about the camera is I do wish it was a 16M but it is only a 12M, which is fine, I would have just perfered the 16...but so far I love the camera!  i still have a lot to learn about it, but no complaints so far...", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008OQG8CG"}}
