{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For the price you could do a whole lot better", "Author": "Tony Montana", "ReviewID": "R18UUBH83F9CHH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "More reputable companies like Canon, Kodak, Nikon, and Fuji offer superior quality at competitive prices. Options for this camera are minimal. There is no timer and despite the claim of an anti-shake feature you need a tripod to take non-motion-blurred pictures thus making the 16.1 mega pixels extraneous. Essentially, this is an expensive $58 kids camera.It drains batteries in minutes and you have to wait a few hours for them to recharge (Obviously the batteries, charger, and SD card are sold separately.)though this is not entirely uncommon for digital cameras.And unless you have an SD card, pricey camera or rechargeable AAA batteries plus a battery charger laying around you can expect to pay an additional $40-$60 to facilitate this bottom end digital camera. Altogether you're looking at potentially paying around $120 for a very low quality camera with very few features that takes poorly lit and blurry pictures.The one good thing about this camera is the swivel preview screen. But it's not worth the price for such poor quality.For this price there are so many better digital cameras out there (unfortunately I need a camera on-the-fly and this was what was available at the store.) From what I've seen of other Vivitar camera reviews this is a brand to steer far away from.Good thing I kept the receipt. High resolution pictures are redundant if the camera can't stay powered long enough to take more than a few blurred unsteady pictures. At best this camera is worth $10-$20My old cell phone can take better pictures than this.Make sure to shop around and look at customer reviews before investing in a digital camera for this price.To date I am the only person who has reviewed this thing model which isn't a good sign in terms of this camera's popularity.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible quality photos. Broke on second day", "Author": "Tom D", "ReviewID": "RFA2MXD7AJH75", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a terrible, terrible camera and a huge waste of money.I got it for my daughter and she took it on a trip. She was only able to take 51 photos before the camera completely stopped working. And of the 51 photos she did take, only two were not blurry.The other photos defaulted to an insanely low ISO value (all below 100), resulting in photos with shutter speed of 1/20 second or slower. Even photos taken outdoors on a cloudy day came out this way! Even the photos without camera shake were still very blurry. I would test the camera myself to see if it was user error, but as I said above, the camera won't even turn on anymore.There's no optical zoom on the camera, but it still has a zoom button that is actually digital zoom (in other words cropping).I would definitely avoid this camera if at all possible.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Lightweight Camera", "Author": "D.

I need to use it for a little bit before i would be able to give a fair review.  Looks & size wise, the product was exactly what I ordered and came in a timely matter.  So far it seems to be a great product.

Brown \"Boogieb\"", "ReviewID": "R25P968EQ8SGM8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my son as his very first camera. He's 11 and I figured it would be great because of the 14 mega-pixels feature and flip screen. I bought it so he could take pics of himself on his Washington, DC field trip. Within a 5 to 6 day period he used 2 sets of triple A batteries and it would have been a 3rd set had I given him extra. The camera is a complete battery sucker. The body of the camera is also cheaply made. I should have chosen a Sony, Canon or Nikon instead.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$54.99", "Features": "2.4-Inch preview flip screen\nAuto flash, face detection, anti-shake\nSelf timer\nCreate self portraits and cool selfies\n4x digital zoom", "Name": "Vivitar 14MP Digital Camera w/ Flip Screen - Red (VF124)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XWUHM1RPL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CE5912W"}}
