{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The 4/3 System Finally Delivers On Its Promise", "Author": "W. Fink \"Wes\"", "ReviewID": "R3CVZJIFSQYW8Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have toyed with the 4/3 digital SLR system several times since it was introduced in 2003, shrugged my shoulders and gone back to Nikon or Canon.  Frankly, I had about given up on 4/3, but Olympus dropped the E-3 on us a few weeks ago and showed us it could be all they promised with 4/3 when it was first introduced over 4 years ago.ANY DSLR system is about lenses in the end, and Olympus 4/3 is blessed with superb optics.  To get an idea of how really great the new Olympus glass is you need to use some of the top lenses, or read a few of the big photo sites like dpreview, imaging-resource, or DCRP.  They have all finally acknowledged in reviews of the E-420/410 and E-520/510 that Olympus has the best quality kit lenses of any camera maker, and that the Olympus claim that lenses designed for digital produce better quality images is proving to be true.  [...] even went so far as to test most of the current Olympus lens line after being so impressed with the kit lenses on the 510/410.Olympus 4/3 is also by design an all-electronic lens mount - like Canon.  Reviewers on the web tend to be so Canon and Nikon biased that they often forget really basic things like this.  The 4/3 system has all motor driven lenses, and the lenses were ALL designed for digital photography.  I am frankly tired of seeing reviews that talk of Canon as if they are the only company with all motor lenses.  There are actually 3 - Canon, 4/3, and Sigma - although some of Sigma's other features are archaic and sales are very low so most just ignore them.  Sony/Minolta  and Nikon are not similarly blessed with an all-electronic lens mount, and many lenses are still noisily driven by screws on the lens mount in both systems.  In fairness, Nikon has been moving rapidly to motor-driven lenses, but Sony seems stuck in their noisy and slower screw-drive AF even though they have used lens motors in a rare few long telephotos.  The point here is that the 4/3 mount at least matches the best, and it is better than most.The Olympus issue has never been glass or lens mount , it has really been the options you had (or rather didn't have) in camera bodies to use with this excellent Olympus glass on an all electronic mount.  As great as the current E-410 and E-510 really are, they are still saddled with an ancient and not particularly low-light sensitive 3-point autofocus system.  Shooting in truly low light was all but impossible and your Olympus searched for focus while Canon, Nikon, and Sony locked on focus.  There just wasn't a choice of anything better from Olympus.  That is until the E-3.The E-3 takes Olympus AF from Sigma territory to state-of-the-art, and as soon as the new 11-point, all cross sensor, dual-plane AF module makes its way down the food chain, no one will ignore Olympus any more.  I hope Olympus can also find a way to move the terrific E-3 feature of AF with manual touch-up down the food chain as well - because the other big Olympus issue is that stupid \"Manual focus by wire\" feature and Manual Focus select by menu  - and it is mostly fixed in the E-3.This time around I bought an E-3 and a 12-60mm - and the tiny little excellent-quality kit lenses for when the 12-60mm weighs too much and I can compromise just a little on quality.  I have added other Olympus equipment to my E-3 system quickly, like the unique 70-300mm (140 to 600mm equivalent with 1:1 Macro), the superbly sharp little 35mm f3.5 Macro that does equivalent TWICE life-size macro right out of the box, and the E-3 grip.I am completely and totally impressed with the E-3.  All the lenses are designed for 4/3 mount and for best performance on a 4/3 camera - they aren't 35mm film designs.  No other camera offers the combination of effective live-view, built-in image stabilization, the best auto sensor cleaning you can buy, an articulating LCD that can fold away for protection (AND a top LCD for basic data), a built-in pop-up flash, effective dust and splash sealing of the camera AND the lenses, a popularly-priced zoom that covers the equivalent of 140mm to 600mm and does Macro up to equivalent life size (70-300mm), MUCH improved noise reduction that goes to ISO 3200, user-programmable Auto ISO that can cover the full ISO range (Canon still stubbornly refuses to fully offer this option), and the best range of available lenses DESIGNED FOR a digital camera system.The E-3 is a bargain for a true PRO grade camera - and it is easily built as well as the Nikon D3 or the top Canons which are $5000 or more.  You will get real value for the $1699 you spend on the E-3 body compared to any competing system from any company.  However, most will find the E-3 expensive unless they are serious photo hobbyists or Pros, and Olympus needs to move the E-3 refinements down to E-510 price levels as fast as they can.The E-3 is a great piece of creative engineering, an area Olympus is known for.  After all they invented auto-sensor cleaning and live view - which is now finding its way to every DSLR.  This is the best Olympus camera EVER, and once you have used it you will be hooked.", "Date": "December 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "First impressions!", "Author": "S.

Let me know by clicking Yes! :)A quick summary:Olympus made major improvements to their pro line in almost every facet-- structural, design, robustness, lens and imaging performance.The SWD lens performance paired with this body is outstanding, as you'll see in my video demo. The imaging sensor and processor are very good also.  Noise levels are on par with the Digic3 processors from Canon.  A fantastic buy, I highly recommend this camera for both professional and serious photo enthusiasts.  There are plenty of very good ind-depth, technical reviews available.  Here are a few I recommend:[...][...][...]", "Date": "November 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Underrated, yet outstanding!", "Author": "T. Haines \"Shutter Bug\"", "ReviewID": "R3DZM1XD846QBE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the E3 from my e500.  Some of the things that enticed me were the additional focus points, and articulated screen.  Everything else about the camera was just added niceness.The camera is pretty great.  It's an obvious step up from the e500 in terms of quality, and performance.  Images look beautiful, focus is a lot faster and more accurate.  The tilting screen and live view are things that I wonder how I ever lived without....a HUGE boost to my shooting and the types of shots I can get.I think Olympus is underrated in the DSLR business.  Because it uses a 4/3 sensor people talk a lot of bad trash about the system.  But in real-world shooting, the E3 really stands tall.  And I say this as someone who also shoots with a Nikon D300.  Another great thing about the Olympus system is the availability of Olympus lenses.  And the lens is what it's all about.  Olympus lenses are second to none.  I actually find that the Olympus lens lineup makes me frustrated about Nikon's comparably dinky lineup--and Nikon has A TON of lenses, but none that can match the quality/speed of Olympus lenses.  Good luck finding an f2.8 telephoto lens of the same price or quality as Olympus' 50-200.  Olympus beats Nikon in terms of lens quality, easily.Having said that, the things I don't like about the E3 are its low-light performance (the E3 is better than the e500 or e510 in low-light shooting but it still falls behind the competition) and its tendency to clip highlights.  In low-light situations the E3 tends to produce noisy shots at higher ISOs or during long exposures--considerably noisier than many other cameras (but I wouldn't say they're unusable).  Highlight clipping speaks for itself....overall the dynamic range of the E3 isn't as good as some cameras, but it's on par with others.  Depends on the camera you compare it to.  Those are the only two negatives I can think of.  In terms of metering, it's very good, in fact I prefer how it meters to how the D300 meters (though the D300 doesn't clip highlights like the E3 does) because the tones are closer to the mood I want to get.  More moody,  tones whereas the D300 is a little too LOUD in its tones.  Some of you may dig loud tones.  Your mileage my vary.All around this camera is as good as my D300, and in many ways its better.  In just those two areas (low-light, and highlight reproduction/dynamic range) its a little disappointing.  But, for whatever it's worth, I do all of my \"serious\" or \"important\" shooting with my E3, not my D300.  My E3 lenses are better, the articulated screen of the E3 is a life-saver, I like how it meters better...it's just a really great camera that I love shooting with.The E3 is an excellent camera, and easily on par with anything that Canon offers--and even better than a lot of what Canon offers.  And its on par or better than everything Nikon offers, with the exception of the D300 (in my opinion).  Nikons D300 is ever so VERY SLIGHTLY superior in some ways but then you don't get the same lens quality with Nikon, and that's the deal maker or deal breaker for me...lenses.  If I could only keep one camera, I'd keep the E3...in a heartbeat.  Get this camera!", "Date": "April 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Olympus  Digital E-3 is a Superstar!", "Author": "Raymond S. Iorio", "ReviewID": "RG6CACX2GMAML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I have been a Nikon f4s & Contax G2 User (35mm) for years, I have switched over to digital - and I am glad I choose the Olympus E-3 as my dslr.  The camera is just a great piece of Photographic Equipment - providing me with a great way to transition from Pro 35mm to Pro Digital SLR.  It is much lighter and compact than my workhorse f4s with all the same features plus many extras.Impressive metal body frame, water and air tight as a drum,  progressive electronics and intuitive controls the camera rates a 5 star from me - would give it a 6 star if available.  The camera cleans itself electronically - end of dust problems which is the plague of digital slr's.  The auto focus is spot on perfect and really NASCAR fast!  The meter is very good and can be set to matrix, center weighted average, spot, and a few others to experiment with.  I have used the matrix which is very good, but prefer the center weighted metering strictly out of years of habit.  For very akward lighting I prefer spot metering or manual to get the job done correctly.  The camera for all practical purposes (except frame size) is a 35mm slr.  One can choose aperature priority, shutter priority, programed auto, or manual exposure modes.  There is plus and minus ev compensation up to 5.  Bracketing, bulb, just about any shutter speed one could want are all included.  There are numerous other features that can be turned on if one prefers.The 'noise' most people hear about in digital cameras (which is nothing different than grain on 35mm print film) is not present at 100-200 ASA.  It is only minutely present at 200-400 ASA if you use a microscope to examine it - or for the rest of the world not present at all.  At 400 - 800 ASA it is hardly noticable.  As a matter of fact, there is less noise from ASA 400-800 than I have ever seen in the same ASA color print film, that is saying something for this digital.As I said, you can use this just as you would a 35mm slr and with a 2gig memory card you can have about 200 photos using the super fine mode which I prefer.  For most shooting the fine mode would be perfect - super fine is just my preference.From what I have read the Sandisk 2gig III memory card is about the best you can buy.  Most reviews say to stay away from every manufactures 4 or higher gig memory card, I listen to the reviewers on this aspect.The photos already taken with it have been exposed predominately in aperature priority and printed directly without the need for touching up through photo shop - a lengthy way to take photos, in my opinion - call me old fashioned.  To me that is very impressive - almost back to using 35mm without spending hours on touch up for a '24 exposure roll' of film.  However, I have cropped in photo shop and have changed some of the photos to experiment with it (e.g. from super sharp focus to soft focus for effect) and it is useful and may even be necessary for that one complicated lighting condition that only photo shop could improve upon.  For the most part though, the camera photos are pretty near perfect right out of the memory card.The Olympus 12-60mm lens I purchased is superb, the optics are as good if not better than my Contax G2 lens (previously my sharpest lens, even over costly Leica's) and to have the proverbial 'cake and eat it too', it is a zoom lens!  The lens offers me 35mm equivelant of 24-120mm in one lens - perfect for wide angle to telephoto which is the range most pros and 'civilians' use anyway.I have not experimented with the raw feature yet to the chagrin of my photographer friends.  I understand from them that it basically produces a negative which is refined and printed through a program such as Photo Shop.  For the professionals doing magazine layouts and covers, this gives them the ability to produce a job-set print without shooting hundreds of photos to get that one or two elusive top notch photo.  I will try this, albeit I still like the old fashioned way of taking photos without photoshop or raw programs.Digital Camera Pros:A great thing about a digital is you can look at your photos and decide if they are good enough to keep, or you can delete them right then and there and re-shoot.....a definate advantage over film!  Imagine going to Europe, Tahiti, Australia, China, Japan or somewhere else far away and not having to bring 30 rolls of film!  You never have to worry if your photos will come out good either.  No more worry about airport x-ray security ruining your high speed film either.Comparing Nikon D300 to Olympus E-3:While I was planning all along to get the Nikon D300, when holding both the Oly and Nikon in person and going through the motions with both, I picked the Olympus.  The lens was exactly what I was looking for as an all purpose lens, the feel was great and I was very impressed with the camera feel and function.My only suggestion to Olympus and Nikon and the rest of the group is put the Aperature setting on the lens, not the camera body and put the speed on top of the body like the 'good old intuitive days of 35mm'.Cons of the E-3:So far I have not any cons to speak of, the camera performs perfectly doing what a camera should do..... allowing the photographer to be creative and concentrate on composition.  While the Nikon does offer the D300 with 12MP and the Olympus E-3 offers 10MP, the difference is minimal, actually 8MP is all one really needs.  Of course if you plan on blowing every photo up to poster size then wait for heavy, clunky, medium format digitals to come way down in price and when resting use the camera as a dumbell, if you can still lift your arms!Good Shooting.-Ray", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "A Perfect Natural Photography Camera", "Author": "James D. DeWitt \"Alaska Fan\"", "ReviewID": "RBYH2DLCO3XLS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I mostly photograph wild birds, usually with a Zuiko 300mm f2.8 lens, often combined with a 2.0X teleconverter. It's a lot of lens, but the E-3 handles it superbly. Quick, accurate focus. Terrific exposure control, even in automatic settings. Enough pixels that you can crop in post-processing without compromising quality. Rapid shooting, even in RAW mode. I'm a fairly serious photographer and this camera does everything I need. It even feels good in the hand. All this an in-camera image stabilization as well. The IS alone allows you to shoot hand-held with a long lens down to 1/250 second.It's sturdy, too. The camera and lens set up spend most days clamped to a tripod, balanced on my shoulder, banging into shrubbery, or perched on rocks or in swamps. It's amazingly solid.Unlike the E-500, the E-3 sports a true USB-2 connection, so downloads of photos are much quicker.Other reviewers have said that some earlier Olympus accessories don't work with the E-3. That's inaccurate. Some older lenses and flashes can't take advantage of some of the advanced features in the E-3, but they still work just fine. My Zuiko 300mm f2.8 is proof of that.

I was completely wrong. After walking into the Calumet store in Oakbrook, Illinois, I simply couldn't help myself. I picked up the camera, attached my venerable 11-22mm wide angle, and completely fell in love. The feel was perfect. The ergonomics and control layout was a step above the 510, and the magnesium body felt solid as a tank. I had honestly thought about stepping up to the Canon 5D, but couldn't bring myself to put this camera down. It now goes with me wherever I go. Plus, I will never have to worry about a dirty sensor. Nuff said.I got a beautiful Leica/Panasonic 14-50mm lens from a guy on eBay, and that has become my lens of choice for most of my work. Although it is not weather-sealed like the 12-60mm, the price was right and the quality is outstanding. One thing I need to point out. This lens has image stabilization built in. I did a side-by side comparison with this system, and Olympus' own in-body stabilization. No comparison! The Oly system completely blows Leica's away. So much for \"lens specific\" IS systems being superior. I turn it off and keep it off. Bravo, Olympus! I see the other systems adopting your leadership in this regard.Thanks for a great system!", "Date": "April 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "A 4 month usage of the E3 combined with 4 E-300 bodies + lenses", "Author": "HMMWV \"God, Country, Corps\"", "ReviewID": "R3K6NPR13278DW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "4+ Month update on the camera:This is still by far the best SLR cam from olympus.  Neat features are everywhere like a full compliment of buttons on the portrait grip, and the ability to shoot as fast as your memory card can write, with the sandisk IV 5 FPS.First - the system I purchased was a pre-relase system and needed firmware upgrades.  These were trivial with the software and usb cableSecond - even though the 50-200 mm lens did not need an upgrade, two of us noticed that it suffered from the same \"hunting\" during autofocus that the original 50-200 mm did.  The ability to see where the focus was happening with the LEDs on the viewfinder ofset this, but the speeds were not as promised.  It's a minor issue, but not to spec.Third - Using it with to the 50mm prime lens Olympus 50mm f/2.0 Telephoto Macro ED Lens for E1, E300 & E500 Digital SLR Cameras produced exceptionally fast focusing and improved resolution over previous bodies.  Depth of field was exceptional using the twin flash accessory Olympus TF-22 Twin Flash Head (Needs FC-01 Flash Controller, FR-1 & SR-1)Fourth - shooting raw used to mean you always got a fixed size file.  Now raw files vary in size.  photo a 8.5x 11 blank paper and expect a small raw file, but photo a page from the phone book and it will be bigger.  This makes estimating number of exposures a bit more tricky than it used to be, however raw exposure is still lossless and actually uses less space on the memory card than the 8MP cameras did.Finally - you get 3 sets of flash \"GROUPS\" with the E3.  Each can be programmed separately for timing and illumination.  Contrary to preliminary belief, the signalling is not radio frequency but uses the camera's pop-up flash to tell each group how it is to expose.  There are some drawbacks in that you can not use a hotshoe mounted flash nor the popup flash in your flash scene.  Using the remote controlled flahses (3 groups) must handle your lighting.  The plus here is that you can tell each of the 3 groups to increase or decrease light output, for example you might want less light on the backdrop and more on the subject with minimum sidelight.  If you have 3 50R flashes you can accomplish this \"program\" on the camera.  Note, however, that the 50Rs must have their sensor pointed to the popup flash to get their instructions and have their flashtube aimed where you want it to go.  It is very flexible for portrait photography and the only complaint seems to be the loss of the on camera flash to expose the shot since it must program each of the 3 groups.  A group, by the way, can have more than one flash in it if you have a collection of 50R units.  They also come with a tripod mount making it easy to use small tripods to locate the flashes to get their program from the camera and aim the light to your liking.  Finally, they use the Olympus SHV-01 High Voltage Flash Power Pack (for FL-50, SRF11, STF22 & FC01) for rapid cycling in a studio environment.  Combined with the E3's ability to bracket flash exposure which earlier cameras did not do makes this a valued feature.(the remainder of the review is a compilation of 3 people who purchaed prerelease sets of the E3 knowing that Olympus has always put out a quality product.  We had difficulty obtaining all the parts needed but finally did get it all.  Many people asked about compatibility which we tried to answer as best as possible, however older gadgets like the remote trigger have been reintroduced removing the USB trigger and a 6xAA pack has been introduced to the dual-rechargable grip, however it does not like to use the L91 lithium batteries due to the higher voltage)--original review below--I've been an olympus 4/3 system user since the E300 came out at 8 MP, when I upgraded my E20N 5MP by 60% to 8MP so for me the E3 is only a 25% increase in resolution, but a lot of extra features.  I bought the body because I print often on 24x36 size paper on an HP Designjet and that extra 25% can make a difference.I want to clarify that only certain 4/3 system components do not fit the E3's fast focus spec.  Essentially Olympus has developed a new lens design for autofocus, the SWD.  Older lenses WILL autofocus and mount and be recognized by the E3 even though newer versions of some of them have been redesigned.  The difference between the non-SWD lens systems that have worked with the E1, E300, E330, E500, E410, and E510 bodies that you may already own and the new E3/SWD drive lens set is the focus on the E3 w/ SWD lens is specified by Olympus to be 170 ms, exceptionally fast.  Some older lenses focus fast by design (EX: the 14-54 is fast and the 11-22 mm wide angle lens is really fast on all boddies)  The focus on other lenses like the tack sharp 50mm prime lens can extend a barrel as long as the lens body and takes a while.  The 50-200 also extends a very long and wide barrel during focusing which slows it down.To address this, and meet the 170 ms specification, Olympus redesigned the 50-200 into a SWD driven lens.  Evaluation lenses are very fast focus because less movement is required.  Wait to purchase them until the final release as a firmware upgrade is likely on the rare ones that were intended for prerelease evaluation.  All OLY gear upgrades easily via USB.Olympus also put a very common feature of remote strobes with a radio link into the E3.  This required revising the FL-50 Olympus FL-50 Electronic Flash for Olympus C7070, E1, E300 & E500 Digital SLR Cameras into the FL-50R flash FL-50R Wireless Electronic Flash which can be either a transmitter on the hotshoe or receiver, so a pair of the FL-50R flashes will give you the radio remote capability often added as a third party accessory, but now inside the flash itself.  I have the -R but since the FL-50 works as well, my friends have not upgraded yet.  We will update the R with timing info once we get 2 units and can test the radio ability.My friends and I have a variety of olympus bodies so we often trade pieces of the 4/3 system - we have verified the older FL-50 and non-SWD lenses can all be used despite some of the literature that emphasizes the need to buy the new compoents for the E3 system.  TRUTH: If you want to meet the E3 specifications, you'll probably want the SWD lenses for focus speed and FL-50R for remote flash flexibility.  If focus speed isn't high on your priority list you'll be happy and save alot of $ using older lenses and your flash, plus we've been discussing a likely price drop on the older (but good) glass out there.Olympus made a smart move selling the E3 as just a back - pick YOUR lens or keep YOUR lens from an upgrade, but now stores are making E3 \"Kits\"out of just about anything - buyer beware - my E3 kit contained prerelease SWD glass which is not a big deal just a firmware upgrade.  This was from a brick & mortar camera store - not amazon.I made the mistake of buying the \"KIT\" the store assembled with only the new components for the E3.  By un-kitting the body you avoid buying a slow, small, \"made in china\" lens you would never purchase if it were not in the kit.  It requires stores, however,  to stock lenses now!  (Amazon has been a real help getting some oddball lenses)Olympus has kept up with their expectations - the noise reduction on long exposures is still there, and virtually all 4/3 system components work, except to take advnatage of the new focus system you need to buy the supersonic wave drive (SWD) glass which is all in the near $1000 price range.  Write speed to the SD card is great - a fast card will continue to shoot as long as you hold down the shutter and there is room left (continuous mode)So far my olympus groupies have not yet bought a second FL-50R so I can not comment on its radio link.  Once we pair a couple up I will update my review on the FL-50R's backwards compatibility with earlier bodies and take some backlit shots plus check timing impact.  The twin flash Olympus TF-22 Twin Flash Head (Needs FC-01 Flash Controller, FR-1 & SR-1) and ring flash Olympus FS-RF11 Ring Flash Head (Needs FC-01 Flash Controller, FR-1 & SR-1) still work great with the old 50mm macro lens for some razor sharp macro exposures.The live-mos focusing is a pleasure to have again.  The last time I had a live image was on my E20N, so now I can \"see it the way the camera does\" before pulling the trigger.  (I'm mainly using 4 ea E300 bodies for scientific work before I got my E3)  Focus checks are really easy with magnification.  Everyone will especailly like the pivot mechanism designed for the screen -- this feature has been long overdue and is much appreciated as you have camcorder like flexibility on the screen.And speaking of the changes, Olympus FINALLY went back to the the electronic trigger and ditched the USB trigger which made them unusable with my lightning detector.  That, for me, was a key selling point.  It also made the FP-1 usable with the E3, along with a host of time lapse photography accy's such as my lightning detector that exposes very dramatic shots.  If you have the once new, now old USB remote, you need to downgrade to the 3-pin original remote shutter release.Pros/Cons quickly:  PRO's better resolution by 0-50% depending on your existing body, MUCH faster focusing and image processing, more features.  Con's - some 4/3 accessories need to be replaced to get full value from the E3, and they command a professional price.  Most 4/3 stuff still works like it always did, so I'm not too displeased as the 11-22mm lens is fast, but the ec-14 teleconverter has been re-done to an ec-20 t/c for the new SWD lenses (nobody I know has the EC20 yet)  Be prepared to outfit your system differently to handle the E3 depending on your use.Olympus' mild bumpy upgrade path is what cost them one star on this product - I still could see giving it 5 stars by itself, and the lenses are fast in more ways than light gathering, but to say \"certain 4/3 products got upgraded\" is not acceptable when they have been interchangable through the whole E series and across vendor platforms (e.g. panasonic's 4/3 entry) prior to the E3.  While the SWD was a necessity to make it happen, the flash transmitter could have been a sandwich in the hotshoe combined with a receiver hotshoe and mini tripod for the other strobe.  At least Both FL-50's work with the high voltage chargers like the SHV-1 Olympus SHV-01 High Voltage Flash Power Pack (for FL-50, SRF11, STF22 & FC01).  I do alot of macro work with Aperature priority F/10 and above so this was an important feature and I am very happy with the body's focusing using the neaar perfect 50mm macro prime lens.SUMMING IT ALL UP:Yes, you can use your \"old\" glass with the new body, but if you already have a 10 MP OLY back the number one reason to upgrade is the speed of the focus, which unfortunately requires new glass with the SWD system.  Questions we still don't know are mostly about the future of SWD lenses - like will they introduce a 300mm SWD?  If so, this is a serious competitor to the Canon lineup and I would not be surprised to see it on the sideline at a football game as a professional camera.  If you are a newcommer to DSLR, this is a great entry point for a camera that people would call professional.  If you are looking to save money last years' model will definitely drop in price with the E3 out there.

Secondly, I must say that if you are a gear junkie, then this is a great system to get into--Olympus, in my opinion, makes the best lenses for digital imaginable.Now, why do I say, 'if you know how to use it?'  The images produced by the E-3, and the E-1, have a film-like quality to them, an almost Leica quality.  The color rendition of the E-3 image sensor is beautiful.  And the noise it produces (all image sensors produce noise) is also quite lovely compared to other systems.  But these qualities are only appreciable if the images have been exposed perfectly and in perfect, or nearly perfect light.  So if you rely on your camera to manage exposure for you, if you don't know how to use exposure compensation, or spot metering, or even manual mode exposure, then this camera will force you to learn all about obtaining perfect exposure.Next, I must share with you the only major disappointment that I have in the camera.  Yes, it has the fastest autofocus in the world with certain lenses, but more importantly, only in the right light, with the right subject.  Much too often, the camera searches for focus far too long, or simply will not find focus at all.  If you are a photojournalist or a sports photographer who relies on autofocus, then this is not the camera for you.Finally, you may be wondering why i give the E-3 five stars (I would give ten if Amazon would let me).  Because, for the right photographer doing the right kind of photography, this camera is sublime.  Its favorite use for me is travel photography, but it is outstanding for fashion, outdoor portraiture, studio work, wildlife (A 300mm f2.8--that's a 600mm f2.8 equivalent, WOW!), street photography, landscape and cityscape (check the 7-14mm f4 lens--the best wide-angle zoom manufactured by anyone), and the list goes on, just not fast-paced sports.So, I highly recommend the E-3 system, with the above caveats, to anyone as a primary system, and to everyone else as a system to supplement an existing Canon or Nikon system.", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Faster, sharper, true-to-life and durable", "Author": "F.

It was so comfortable, in spite of the weight, that I felt I could easily take pictures all day long in superb comfort. I have tried Canon and Nikon (obviously) and the grip felt compromised compared to the Olympus which was rugged and balanced. It felt like I was never going to drop it either - quite important.Soon after I bought it though, I noticed that the autofocus was getting less and less reliable until it packed up ALTOGETHER. I was upset as I wanted to take it with me to England but I had to get it fixed for another date soon after I returned from my trip.

The three different displays (veiwfinder, rear and top LEDs) are very clear and once used to, are quite logical and easy to understand. The focus time of the lenses is so fast and so reliable you sometimes have to be careful of using continual focus mode as it zooms in and out at such amazing speed it's quite bewilering.

Davis", "ReviewID": "R13DXB1QXB6C0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I start the review: I was initially in the market for the E-30, but a special deal on the internet through Dodd Camera allowed me to get the E-3 for only $800, I could NOT pass up that deal!The Olympus E-3 is a fantastic product. When I was considering purchasing one, I had heard many complaints online in different forums whom had many members who admittedly have never used a 4/3 camera, just heard about them. Before using the E-3, I was (and still am) a user of the Olympus E-520 camera which gave me excellent results, but had some minor limitations that made me want to upgrade. First is the viewfinder. In the E-520, the viewfinder is NOT bad at all, like many would lead you to believe. I found that attaching the Olympus ME-1 eyecup to my E-520 helped, but I can see how this could pose a problem with people who wear glasses. The E-3 addresses this with the best viewfinder the 4/3 system has ever seen. Much larger & brighter, I find myself doing much manual focusing with it, whereas I did have a tendency to rely on the AF performance of the E-520.The focusing speed of this camera is incredibly fast with SWD lenses, and very fast with my other High Grade lenses. It is important to note that low light situations have caused the camera to hunt at times. The AF assist of my Metz 58 flash helps to quickly bring the image into focus when I shoot at low light venues such as performances or night time portraits. In good lighting conditions, the focusing is almost instant, in lower light, it is fast, just not as fast as some users might think when they hear \"World's Fastest AF\".Lastly, the noise performance. The camera produces great results up until about iso 800+. Images get noisy in the higher settings, BUT THIS IS NOTHING THAT CAN'T BE CLEANED UP IN POST PRODUCTION! Also, iso 3200 images retain a lot of detail and the DR performance is nice as well. When I want to clean up images, I usually use Nik Software's Dfine 2.0 and this has worked excellent in reducing noise but not smearing the details & making the image look smeared when viewed close up. This software with this camera are perfect for each other.Who would I recommend this camera to?: Those who have film or digital slr experience, those who don't find noise at higher iso settings to be a major issue, those who want to use fantastic lenses, I could go on. There are many good reasons to pick this camera up if you are interested in the 4/3 system. IF you are new to shooting, some of the settings may confuse you. I had no problem adjusting to the camera ergonomics, but I had been studying the button layout months before purchasing. If you are just shooting jpeg, using high iso settings and don't plan on using any post production software, you may want to look elsewhere as the other manufacturers produce excellent cameras around this price range.All that said, I believe this is the perfect camera for ME and I will be spending much time with it. I highly recommend you at least give it a try if you already own an E-System camera and are looking to upgrade. I haven't tested the weather sealing capability yet, but will be eventually when I decide to shoot in challenging conditions.My images taken with this camera & the E-520 are available to view at [...]Thank You", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "E3 wow", "Author": "R.

Since we completed the new pond decided to use that as subject matter. Using the E-1 and the 70-300 to get close and personal it was apparent that one the body was not fast enough to capture the swimming fish and two it seems the lens was not fast enough given the shooting conditions. Buying a faster lens was not an option given the prices the 50-200 is going for currently. Hence decided to go for a new body. Live view, IS and more pixels where and added bonus on top of the higher fps. Since the E-1 was slow in capturing bursts of fish activity i figured upgrading to the E-3 would provide a better hit rate. All in all the E-3 is nice, feels solid.

The second day of field use, the flash hotshoe cover was missing. On the third day, the remote cable cap was missing. The only cap that stayed on so far is the flash remote cap. When I googled online to replace these caps, I found out many users like me have problem about caps falling. Olympus caps is not covered by the warranty, so they referred me to their parts store. Check comments for the links.Be careful about these caps because the weatherproof feature,the main reason I purchased the camera, is only good when these caps are on. When I unknowingly lost my remote cable cap, my camera malfunctioned when it got splashed on. My camera won't stop shooting and non of the buttons and screen worked. I have to prematurely end my picture taking for the day. When the camera dried off the next day, it worked normal again. Without E-3's weatherproof feature, I would settle with half the price DSLRs that can take just as good photos. I think Olympus need to improve their caps from falling off.Other improvements I would like to suggest is first, auto focus capability for lcd screen use. The worlds fastest auto focus will only work when optical view is used. Without it, I have to look back and forth from my optical view and lcd screen. Or I can use the lcd screen all the way, but do everything manually. I aim through my optical view and see the results on my lcd to make sure there's no overexposure, underexposure or out of focused pictures. It would really be easier if I can use the lcd screen all the way just like point-and-shoot cameras. Second , the optical view does not work when the lcd screen is being used. I think it would be great if I have the option to use both optical view and lcd screen simultaneously, so I can use the live view facing to my subject while I use the optical view just like a video camera with articulating screen. Third, I think it would also great if the buttons were bigger for users wearing thick gloves. Fourth, many people say it is heavy and bulky but I don't think it is a major draw back. If olympus can make this camera smaller without compromising its features that would be great. But if not, this disadvantage won't stop me from puchasing this item.Last, capability of taking a video like Canon Mark II and Nikon D90 would be a great option.I gave E-3 four stars because I love the weatherproof feature, articulating screen (you can take photos of the eifel tower with you in it! Place this camera closest to the ground, zoom out, and use the articulating screen to aim), fast auto focus when paired with 12-60mm, and the lens options. If the recommendations are addressed mentioned above or at least have better caps and have an auto focus capability when lcd is used like the point and shoot cameras, I'd give this camera a 5 star.", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "Scott B.

The button layout is also very different from what's on the E-510/520, so I found myself on uncharted territory as this camera needed some \"re-learning\". Also, the grip didn't feel awfully right as the front control wheel didn't fall naturally on my index finger as it did with the E-1 and I couldn't help but wonder why Olympus had changed the E-3 so much?? Wouldn't it have been easier for E-1 users, considering they've used it for so long, to move to a camera which looked and behaved similarly?? But all this became moot after one weekend of shooting with the E-3. This is a very easy to use camera and the reason why the re-design was necessary was because this was a whole new camera!The biggest improvements for me were:1. Incorporating in-body stabilization.2. On-board flash, this can be a life-saver when you require fill flash without a bulky FL-50.3. Bigger and brighter LCD, big step from the E-1!4. Lastly, twice the resolution offered by the E-1.Build quality of the camera is excellent, although the battery door and the swivel LCD seemed like the weakest points of this body and I remain sceptical about these two areas of the body to date.In terms of IQ, this camera goes head to head with any APS-C DSLR out there and can produce stunning images up to about ISO 1250. Once you go beyond this, the IQ degrades substantially and it's no longer on par with its APS-C rivals. As such I would recommend using this camera below ISO 1250 to get the best possible IQ out of it. In terms of JPEG quality with regards to colours and tones, the E-3 is simply stunning! In case you do wish to use higher ISOs, I would recommend shooting RAW and carefully processing as there is visible banding in the shadows when you go to ISO 1600 and upwards. At lower ISOs sometimes I saw noise in the skies, but this seemed very inconsistent and I'm not sure why it appeared in some images and and wasn't visible in others.Overall, this is an excellent pro-level four-thirds camera and balances very well with the SHG Zuiko lenses. If you have the money and are willing to work within its limitations, this camera can offer some stunning images and I would highly recommend it.Personally, I kept my E-1 and gave my E-3 to my brother as I'm still able to pull the same IQ from the E-1 as I can from the E-3 (apart from resolution).", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Super Camera", "Author": "Marc A.

While the camera is a truely professional rig with more options and customizable featues than you can shake a stick at, and while it takes pictures that rival anything one might see in Vogue or National Geographic, or even on a billboard overlooking your local highway, where it fails miserably is in the newly touted swivel LCD screen.
