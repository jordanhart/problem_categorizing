The shutter button on my daughters stopped working, and after examining it I found the switch had broken.  A quick drive to the local electronics store for a 4 pack of SPST tact switches (single pole, single throw, momentary contact switches) cost me $4.50, then about 5 mins with a soldering iron and it works better than new.  I know not everyone is willing to try a repair like this but it is cheap and easy and now my little girls says I am her hero.  No excuses for Crayola, they should have built a better product to begin with but at least it was easy to work with and the parts are in stock at most local electronics stores.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$19.42", "Features": "Takes up to 120 photos or a few minutes of video\nEasy to hold for small hands\nEasy to see preview screen", "Name": "Crayola 2.1 MP Camera - Green (24073-PDQ) Colors May Vary", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51K98LcepaL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008MYUHG8"}}
