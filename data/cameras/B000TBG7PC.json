{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great value", "Author": "James P.", "ReviewID": "R16RIB7HATDQ3H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the ZModo DVR with 4  cameras about a year ago. The included cameras were okay during the day, but at night the onboard lighting was useless.Since then I have purchased two Evertech dome lights including the 600DVL and the 700DVL with varizoom. Both of these were great cameras, but a tad expensive. Then I purchased one of the VideoSecu 1/3\" 420 Line Sony Dome cameras.This camera performs almost as well as the more expensive models so I purchased 3 more to round out my setup and saved several $$. The night lighting is strong and even. There may be a difference between the resolutions of the 420 and 600/700 cameras, but I cannot see it on my DVR which is set to record at a D1 quality level.The only reason that I would opt for the more expensive camera would be if I needed the varizoom of the 700DVL. The 700DVL also included the inline OSD adjustments, which I don't really need for my application.In summary, I think this dome camera is a great value and will meet the needs of most people. Just make sure you purchase the Sony 1/3\" model.And Linda agrees.Enjoy...Warren!", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Papa", "ReviewID": "R292Y7VJKOG5LU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All I got to say, Ordered Two More, day vision great and night vision was just as great.

Fantastically clear picture at night with minimal light. Fairly easy to install. (Recommend wrapping cord around lower piece when mounting to keep it from dropping. Did handle a drop to the ground, but not recommended. The only thing I wish this could do is pan and tilt. Price is fantastic.
