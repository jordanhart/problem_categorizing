I received my WG-1 and gave it a detailed inspection. The fit and finish on all the controls and screen seemed very nice, but the access door for the battery/memory card seemed quite flimsy. It has a soft rubber seal that appears to be adequate.. but beware. I tested my WG-1 by submerging it wile taking video in my swimming pool. I slowly dipped below the waterline and held the camera at various angles. Once the camera was about 2ft deep, the functions locked up. Unfortunately, this will require sending it back to Pentax for inspection/ repair. Huge hustle to say the least.", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hail Snow Rain Rock!", "Author": "N.

Once I switched from using the auto mode and instead used 'P' mode the picture quality improved immensely.  I have used the camera for snorkeling in Maui, 4wheeling in the outdoors and as a general camera around town.  The only issues is the lack of image stabilization, which you get in the Cannon digital waterproof camera, the shutter speed could be a bit faster and it's not the greatest at taking pictures at night.  But the slimmer profile and solid container more then makes up for it.I did have issues with the stock digital battery in the heat down in New Orleans.  It would cause the digital screen to fade to white, at first I thought it was a problem with the screen itself which is a known issue with the Pentax digital cameras.  But switching to the back-up battery resolved the issue.  Out of everything included in this kit I mainly use the extra battery... and that is about it.  The mini tripod is cool but I have not been in a situation where it would actually be useful.But the camera does exactly what I want it to do.  Be able to be dropped, dust proof, water proof and fits in a pocket.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "pentax optio", "Author": "garrett", "ReviewID": "R1RTCDPZTSMXWO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "extreamly bad. i had bought one took it to the keys. five miniutes in the water it broke. warranted that one the second one lasted 1 hour around the pool, till it went under water to take one picture than died. i would not buy one", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$429.95", "Features": "Rugged 12th-generation waterproof digital camera is adventure proof, and suitable for almost any environment\nWaterproof to 33 feet; shockproof design protects from drops up to 5 feet; also crushproof, coldproof and dustproof\n14-megapixel resolution; wide-angle 5x internal optical zoom lens (28-140mm equivalent)\nCapture video in widescreen 720p HD at 30 frames per second\nCompatible with SD, SDHC, SDXC memory cards", "Name": "Pentax Optio WG-1 Adventure Series 14 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 5x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom (Black) 8GB SD HC Card Battery and More Accessory Saver Bundle", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SM7IlCUJL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003H7FJTA"}}
