Daryl in the warehouse cannot tell the difference between white and black.  They said \"what's the difference?\" They said \"return it then we will refund the cost\". They won't exchange it. Sucks if you have a rush job and you have requirements. Also check the 18/2 for continuity because I found a break in the wire after 25 feet.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great quality, even better price!", "Author": "J F", "ReviewID": "RZPQMSX0OKVL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've bought different brands of siamese cable in the past, this is the best cable I've bought for the price. The jacket of the wires doesn't feel cheap and is easy to cut/strip. I terminated about 15 BNC ends with the spool of 500ft and only had 1 that was intermittent, re-made the end and it was all working. I will definitely buy again! I had no issues with the spool in a box, except it didn't pull as easy as other boxes but once you start the pull it comes along easy.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gets the job done.", "Author": "R. Ewing", "ReviewID": "R2FHNX7JKQ4260", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Worked fine. Coax was of sufficient quality though shield braid was sparse. The power wires appear to be a copper clad aluminum, so the are not solid copper. Still works great though. Strips easy with diagonal cutters, kliens, wire strippers. Also, mine came as a reel in the box which is a big plus. I have ordered 6 boxes so far and they have all been black.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "At least it works", "Author": "Nicolas Shelton", "ReviewID": "R2N8QL63QXKKE6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Purchased 2 black, received 1 black and 1 white.

I really like the fact that the 18/2 has it's own sheath, which allows me to run it up the power supply as one cable.  I've had used Siamese in the past that wasn't like this, which makes for more work and a sloppier install.
