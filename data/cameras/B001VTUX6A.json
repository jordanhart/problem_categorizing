Seemed like a normal camera, until a few months later I was messing with the settings and noticed it had a Professional setting right next to Auto. Since then this camera has gone everywhere with me and has not left Professional mode, unless I need to take a video here and there. Either way this camera is amazing on pro-mode even my mom who has a $3,500 Olympus with telescope lenses wants to borrow it because of how crystal clear the photos turn up. Sure it may take some time for the sensor to lock onto what you want but it's worth it for the quality this camera has.I have uploaded some photos in the customer gallery :)", "Date": "September 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Get it", "Author": "chezer", "ReviewID": "RS25ZKWNRZQFB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for its price. I read a review from a semi-pro who recomended this camera before I purchased mine . This is an older model.  On this model you can use your own rechargable batteries. One step above this one I would get now because it can be recharged straight from the camera(its like $10 more).  I've had my camera for more than a year now and so there is a newer model out.. Great pictures, everyone comments on how great my photograpny is (its easy with this camera) Don't lose any cords because its almost impossible to get the Sanyo replacement cords.  Its a really good camera!! My mother has a more expensive camera but we use mine because it takes better pics.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "love my camera", "Author": "Joan D.

Walmart would not take it back, and indeed had no more of them in stock...Sanyo said it was warrentied for 30 days and it would be cheaper to buy another one.  Tried contacting a live someone/anyone at Sanyo to no avail.  Automatted Q&A; only.

But then one day when I went to use it an error came up regarding the lens.  I've come to find out from searching other web sites that this is a very common problem with the camera.  It must have been so common that you can't find this camera on Sanyo's website anymore.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "SANYO VPC-S1070W DIGITAL CAMERA\n10.0 MEGA PIXELS\n2.4\" LCD MONITOR\n3X OPTICAL ZOOM, 1600 ISO, FACE DETECTION, DIGITAL ANTI-BLUR\nUSB/AV CABLE, SOFTWARE CD-ROM, POUCH, HAND STRAP, 2 AA RECHARGEABLE BATTER AND QUICK CHARGER", "Name": "Sanyo VPC-S1070W 10.0 MP Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21CafCi1-QL.jpg", "ProductID": "B001VTUX6A"}}
