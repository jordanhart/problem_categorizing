{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Molly S.", "Author": "Molly \"Homeschoolmom\"", "ReviewID": "R3T8MTOWWUFSST", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my 7 year old. He figured out to use it mostly by himself. On the product description it says it takes Triple AAA batteries, but it actually takes double AA. He loves the video mode, but wishes it has sound. This camera has no Mic. I think for the price this is a great camera to buy for a child to start out with. Things I like about it are that you have an expandable card slot so he can take tons of pictures, and it has a nice big screen on the back for him to watch what his is filming or taking a photo of.", "Date": "February 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "It works for me.", "Author": "Jennifer's Amazon", "ReviewID": "R1XNVW5HTJ5HQ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a digital camera, but I also wanted one that had the color on it so I knew that it was mine. The camera has great zoom and it is easy to transfer the pictures to the computer. The flash on this camera disappointed me though, it doesn't do great taking pictures at night even set on night mode, and once you take a picture using the flash it has like a 10 second hesitation before you can take another picture with the flash again. This camera works for me, but if you are wanting something for night or fast paced picture taking like sports, this isn't your camera.", "Date": "January 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Inexpensive Camera", "Author": "GreyGhost", "ReviewID": "R2U81LE6AAEJCU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a a good little camera for the price you pay.  The photo quality is excellent and it had all the features I was looking for. You definitely want to get a memory chip for the camera at point of purchase. The only limitation to the camera is that you can not here audio on any replay of video in the camera. Now it does record sound as promised, but you won't know how it sounds until you transfer it to a computer. And the audio quality is not that super. But it is a great little camera for the price. I am happy with it.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "superior quality", "Author": "Michael Mcdade \"und qrtly\"", "ReviewID": "R2NMRDHTB36RJJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "dependability and ease of use are what i rate a product. i have seen digital cameras that sell for $300-$400. that dont perform anywhere near as good or produce the quality of images. to top it off you get avi too! if you want the camera to perform flawlessly all you have to do is take the time to read the instructions and you will have no problems. one of the biggest problems with this product is that people dont take the time to learn to use this fine product. it gets 4stars from me.", "Date": "August 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Junky camera, should be expected for the $", "Author": "Eric E.", "ReviewID": "R1H33OXB1DX4K7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It has a cheap feeling to it.

Works fine for her purposes.  Zoom is slow.  Camera does not retain mode setting between power on/off so if you have it in video mode and shut it off, it will revert to picture mode when you turn it back on.

Why is this camera rated so high? I was sucked in by the general positive tone of the reviews on this basic camera and bought it as a gift for someone who didn't want a lot of bells and whistles. I would say it might be good for a child's toy if it were priced under $50. On the positive side, I think it's a nice looking, easy to use camera. It will take decent pictures in good light outdoors. The 9 MPs seemed like it would compensate for a weak flash/low light, but sorry. It doesn't. If your subject is more than 5 or 6 ft away, it will be dark or so pixel deprived it will look like mush. In hindsight, the person that received this camera wishes they had let me send it back when I offered to originally. I wouldn't ever buy another camera without an optical zoom feature either. Spend another $20-$30 dollars and get something better.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Ugh", "Author": "Deborah L.

But I have no clue why the ratings are so high on this camera. It takes really bad quality photos and it feels so light that I'm afraid it will break.
