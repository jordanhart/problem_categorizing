If you can get by with 100' go with those and maybe it won't be bad but my logic was they were only a couple of dollars more then the 100' ones so I bought them but wish I had gotten the 100'.  I'm not about to change them out now but for you future buyers, you need to know.  The longer the cable, the worse the signal.  Wish I had known before just how bad the signal would be.  I compared a 25', 60' and 150' cable and it's very noticable.  The 25' ones are much clearer.", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Celson Hubner Junior", "ReviewID": "RSX51MM84RUE1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I look by internet in site amazon.I  by for me and my son.I recommended For every oneThe price is very good", "Date": "July 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$79.99", "Features": "All-in-one video and power cable\nPlug and Play ready.
