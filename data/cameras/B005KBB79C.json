{"Reviews": [{"Title": "OMG.. Just BUY this Camera!  NOW with Camera Raw Support", "Author": "George Sherwin", "ReviewID": "R3030QGEJMYHOU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PLEASE SEE MY MORE RECENT UPDATES AT THE END OF THIS REVIEW.  I've downgraded my rating from 5 stars to 4 as well.For the past couple of months I've been looking for a high end \"pocket\" camera to fill the gap between my Casio throw-away and my Nikon D200.  I read all the reviews for the Ricoh GRD iii and iv, and couple of other cameras in that price range and performance, and was just about to pull the trigger on one of those choices.Then, just a week ago, I stumbled on to a reference for the Fuji X10.  I had long lusted after the previously-released X100, but just decided that the buy-in price was a bit too steep just for the cool-factor, for a camera barely less portable than the D200.After lots of pondering, I decided to place an Amazon order for this camera.  Then, as now (late Nov 2011), Amazon showed the camera as currently out of stock.  I went ahead and placed the provisional order.  Two days later, I received notice that Amazon expected to have the camera by early December.  The FOLLOWING day, I got notice the camera had shipped!!, and I should see in on Monday.  Instead, the very next day, a Friday, the camera showed up at my door step!I'll readily admit to being an unabashed impulse buyer.  And, let's face it, 600 clams for a \"point and shoot\"  is not a trivial sum, and I fully expected that I might experience a bad case of the post-purchase blues once the new wore off my latest toy.Thus far such has not been the case!  This camera has absolutely exceeded ALL my expectations.  When the camera arrived, a professional photographer friend was a house guest, and I could hardly pry the camera from his hands.  Both he and I were blown away by the incredible low-light performance of this camera.  The image stabilization works well with the fast lens and auto ISO modes.  We took some night-time indoor shots at shutter speeds of 1/4 second, hand held without tripod, and the results were sharp and acceptably noiseless.I won't bore readers with all the capabilities of this camera.. many other reviews cover this thoroughly.  However, I've discovered many neat features that aren't even covered in the manual.  One of my favorite features is how the MENU button is context-sensitive... therefore, if, say, you press the pop-up flash button, and then want to modify some of the internal flash settings, press the MENU button, and you will automatically be in the flash sub-menu.  The same is true for other functions, such as scene mode selection.I'm also very impressed with the \"EXR\" mode which allows for a wider dynamic range for scenes containing both extreme dark and light areas.  It really works, with phenomenal results.  There are many other scene and \"film\" modes (such as high contrast B&W;) that work well, and, mercifully, Fuji has avoided cluttering the menus with those gimmicky modes that no semi-serious photographer would ever use.Virtually every \"scene\" setting (such as: Portrait, Soft Portrait, Landscape, etc) and \"film\" setting (Standard, Soft, Vivid, Monochrome, Sepia, etc) are features that I could see myself actually using on occasion for quick, one-shot pleasing effects.Finally, a few general comments about ownership:1)  The strap that comes with the camera is a neck strap,and a very cheesy one at that, which I can't envision ever using, unless I decide to go to Disneyland and join all the tourists.  (update.. Okay, I did get a realistic faux-leather strap with the after market case I purchased (described below), and I installed it with a pair of those little clip connectors so I can remove it when it's in the way.On the other hand, you really do need a wrist strap.  The camera is just small enough that it is a bit intimidating to use it without a strap.  Every time I picked up the camera I always felt I was going to drop it for sure (already been there, done that, with a cheapy camera).I found the perfect strap right here on Amazon, an Op/Tech for some $8.  It fits snugly around the wrist, and has a quick disconnect at the camera to detach when desired:  OP/TECH USA 6704062 SLR Wrist Strap, Neoprene Camera Wrist Strap (Royal)2)  As others have described, this is not really a pocket camera, except perhaps to stow in your coat or cargo pants pockets.  All other things being equal, I would have preferred a slight smaller size, but decided to give up that minor inconvenience in favor of the performance of this camera.  It's light and easy to carry, and fits easily in your glove box, door pocket, underneath the seat, brief case, or ?  Try that with your full-on DSLR!3)  You'll certainly want a case to project this baby.. of course, none comes with it.  Pay the $150 for the Fuji leather case if you must, but if you are just looking for protection, buy an identically constructed case with snap open front made of \"imitation leather\" (specifically for the X10) on eBay for $21, as I did.4) Likewise, you'll certainly eventually want the lens hood and filter adapter (a requirement to use any standard filter.. 52mm).  Again, you could pay $99 and up for the official branded Fuji unit, or for $30 get an after market unit complete with a UV filter right here on Amazon EzFoto Adapter Ring + Hood (100% replaces FUFJIFILM LH-X10) + 52mm Pro1-D Super Slim Multi-Coated UV Filter for Fuji Finepix X105) Finally, I'd suggest going ahead and springing for a Neutral Density Filter (52mm again).  You will definitely need this if you want to take advantage of the narrow depth of field and Bokeh effects when using the maximum F2 aperture in bright sunshine.  Otherwise the shutter speed will max out before reaching the correct exposure, even with the lowest ISO setting.  You can get a quality Tiffen brand 0.9 ND filter (about 3 f-stops compensation) for about $16  Tiffen 52mm Neutral Density 0.9 Filter6) Oh, and the tiny NP-50 battery is only good for some 300 shots (according to Fuji).  Fortunately, these are ubiquitous and cheap.. I picked up a pair of batteries on eBay for about $12 with free shipping.7) My only major frustration with this camera is the Raw format it uses (Fuji RAF).  I like to take all my images in Raw, and use Photoshop or Lightroom Camera Raw for post-processing.  Unfortunately, as near as I can determine, my up-to-date Camera Raw software does not currently support Fuji's proprietary format, so you have to use the included software to convert the Raw images.  I haven't actually played with the software yet, other than a quick review of the screens.  It does seem to have the basic controls you'd expect, but it just creates an unnecessary and cumbersome intermediate step between my images and my favorite software which I've used for some 15 years.  Hopefully Adobe will get cranking and create support for the X10 soon.  UPDATE.. Photoshop Camera Raw and Lightroom both do fully support the Camera Raw Fuji format, so you can just toss that Fuji software conversion disk (or maybe as I did, use it as a beer coaster on your desk!)Now go out and have some great fun with this camera!Update - November 28* - It's true... the smaller sensor size doesn't produce the same limited Depth of Field or Bokeh effect at wide open apertures as would a full-size DSLR.  Fortunately, Fuji added a very cool shooting mode called \"Pro Focus\" (under the ADVANCED shootimg selection).  Just focus in on your desired subject and pull the trigger.. The X10 takes just a second or so to process, and then gives you a great blurred background, with sharp subject.  Of course, I've done this many times in Photoshop, but how nice to just select this mode, snap, and be done.  No idea how they pull this off, but it really works well.  You can even select 3 different levels of background \"out of focus\" when choosing this mode.  (Later update... with the new Focus filters in Photoshop CS6, I find I have much more control by avoiding ANY of the photo-altering gimmicks in the camera.. I just shoot in Camera Raw, then fix whatever needs fixing quickly in Lightroom or Photoshop)* - a couple of reviewers opined that a 40.5mm filter might just screw into the Fuji lens.  I bought a 40.5mm UV filter to find out.  The answer is a definite NO... I guess Fuji wanted to shake another hundred bucks out of its customers and sell the \"filter adapter\".. boo Fuji!Update - December 14I just read a blog indicating that Adobe now has Camera Raw processing updates for Photoshop CS5 AND Lightroom 3.  Just downloaded both, and YES, you can now throw away that funky SilkyPix Raw converter software that comes with the camera.  For Lightroom 3, you'll need version 3.6 And for Photoshop CS5 you'll need Camera Raw version 6.6.  Download them both at:  [...]Note that only Photoshop CS5 supports the X10 Camera Raw updates.  You DO have version CS5 don't you?  If not, trust me... forget about buying another camera and spring for CS5 AND Lightroom 3.  You'll thank yourself a thousand times!  (Update Aug 2012... Okay, now is CS6 and Lightroom 4.. both MAJOR improvements... grossly expensive, but oh so essential for any other than pure amateur photographer)Update August 2012There has been much discussion in these reviews about the \"orb\" problem with the X10.  After some 5,000 pictures, I'll admit I've gotten \"orbs\" in perhaps 4-5 images, all of which were easily corrected in seconds in Photoshop.  Nevertheless, when I learned that Fuji was offering free sensor replacement to correct the \"orb\" problem, it just made sense to take advantage of that.I went on the Fuji site, and registered my name.  Just a short time later, I received an email notifying me that Fuji was now ready to replace my sensor.  This occurred back in June 2012.  Unfortunately, I use my camera almost every weekend in conjunction with my Antique Limousine business ( [...] ) and was reluctantly to let go of my camera for an indeterminate period of time.Finally, in late August, I decided to bite the bullet and send in my camera for repair.On the same day UPS notified me that my camera had been delivered to Fuji's repair center, I received an email from Fuji acknowledging receipt of my camera, and advising me they would send it back within 10 days.  You can imagine my surprise, then, when on the following day, I received another notification from Fuji telling me my camera had been shipped out, and the tracking info advised me I would receive my camera the FOLLOWING DAY!Sure enough, less than 8 days after I dropped off my camera to UPS, it arrived back in hand.Best of all, the repair invoice indicated that I had received a NEW replacement camera!  This included a new metal lens cover (shipping instructions had explicitly told me to keep all extra parts.. battery, memory, etc), so now I have a spare!I'm writing this just hours after receiving my NEW, FREE, RETURNED FREE OVERNIGHT FEDEX Fuji X10, and so can't comment yet on improvements to the dreaded \"orb\" problem.One thing I have noticed is that the on-off lens rotation now has an intermediate resistance stop, and does require considerably more effort to turn on and off.  Personally, I loved the smoother, less resistant original lens, but can only assume that Fuji bowed to the handful of whiners who complained that it was too easy to turn it off when rotating to the Wide Angle position.... really??Again I want to emphasize that I'm in no way a standard bearer for the X10.  There are a few things I take issue with, most notably the almost unusable manual focus mechanism (see below *), and the non-standard filter threads.  Nevertheless, I still remain pretty enthralled with my X10, and now I see that Amazon has finally dropped the price a bit to make it even more attractive.If you're the kind of photographer who just likes to take low-resolution JPEG snapshots to email to friends on upload to your Facebook, then you'd probably be just as well off with a $150 point-and-shoot.  But if you enjoy turning ordinary snapshots into works of art, shooting in the RAW mode and using Photoshop/Lightroom to enhance, then this is the perfect camera for you!* As I discussed in a separate comment response, the cumbersome manual focus situation has been resolved!  I learned in the (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Photographer's Guide to the Fujifilm X10, available in Kindle or paperback Photographer's Guide to the Fujifilm X10 that, when in Manual Focus mode, you can aim the camera at the desired subject, and momentarily press the AEL/AFL button, and the focus will change to the correct distance.  Then it is a simple matter to fine tune the focus (if needed) with the focus wheel (using the focus wheel automatically shifts the display to magnified, to make manual focusing easier.UPDATE - June 2013Well, I've had this X10 for some 18 months now, and used it a lot.  I own and operate a classic car limousine service, catering mostly to weddings, and do a lot of night photography in conjunction with this.  Looking back, my rational for purchasing this camera in the first place was:1) Have a pocketable camera as an alternative to my bulky Nikon D70002) A fast lens for low light photography3) A Wide angle aperture for those beautiful limited depth-of-field bokeh shots.Over the past few months, I find that I am picking up the D7000 for my nighttime engagements, and that the X10 is gathering dust in the closet, and, honestly, I have to say that I'm a bit disillusioned by the camera at this point.  Here are the reasons, corresponding to my original purchase checklist above:1)  This is by no means a pocket camera.  It just ain't gonna happen.  This is a hang-round-your-neck camera, just like a full sized DSLR2)  Fast lens.. well, yes, f2.0 does sound impressive, but, let's face it... it just isn't good enough for any sort of night photography without flash (and that little pop-up flash is only useful if you're shooting right in someone's face).  Sure, you can get an image at night, but it is going to be grainy and you'll never be able to call it a professional image.  The difference in quality between a f2.8 lens on my D7000 and this f2.0 is really glaring.  I know, it's NOT a DSLR, but still, what's the point of paying near-entry-DSLR prices if you can't get better images?3) Limited depth of field.. this has been one of my biggest disappointments in this lens.  An f2.0 lens on a small-sensor camera is NOT equivalent to the same focal length on a DX or FX format camera.  Only when shooting extremes (like focusing on a subject no more than 2 feet away) will you get any semblance of focus fade in the background.  Sure, you can dial up the in-camera D-O-F software, but why would you want to permanently gork up your photo when you can accomplish the same yet better soft-focus effects in Photoshop or Lightroom and have complete control.Other issues that I have increasingly become annoyed with after extensive usage:* The manual focus mechanism is absolutely useless.. to get from one end of the distance scale to the other requires some 8-10 full revolutions of that hard-to-manipulate focus wheel.  Why couldn't they have at least added an acceleration mode to the wheel (turn it faster, move the dial faster).  To make matters worse, the focus selector lever (AF or Manual) on the front in right in the position where virtually EVERY TIME you remove the camera from its case (which you HAVE to do to see the viewfinder or back screen) the lever gets moved from AF to Manual.  Can't tell you how many ruined images I've deleted because the $!%@@& focusing got switch to manual without my noticing... grrr* Lack of standard filter threads... This is one of the most idiotic and non-customer-friendly features of this camera.  The threads on the lens won't match any standard filter, so if you want any sort of filter, even a UV to protect the non-replaceable lens, you have to shell out a hunk to Fuji for their adapter ring... Then.. the filter housing obstructs the view in the viewfinder; you can't use that nice aluminum lens cap; AND, now the camera won't fit in that expensive leather Fuji case you bought.  Really?? Was this camera designed by photographers, or just a bunch of engineer/marketing geeks?* Auto White Balance... The auto white balance on this for night time shots is just unusable.  On virtually every shot I have to make major adjustments to the white balance.  I shoot almost exclusively in RAW mode, so pictures are salvageable, but it is an annoying additional step, when I almost never have to adjust the white balance on similar shots with my D7000* Battery life is pretty short... I don't understand why they couldn't have found room for a larger battery in such a large bodyIn summary, 1.5 years down the road, the X10 (and now its successor the X20) is starting to look a bit long in the tooth.  For your money you're getting:1) A cool retro-look camera that feels and is solidly built2) Camera RAW ability3) A reasonably fast lensFor my money, if I were buying a camera to fit this niche today, I'd opt for the new Fuji XF-1... it's a true pocket camera but appears to have roughly the same guts as the X10, probably improved, with a slightly faster lens, and it looks great!", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "a very capable little camera", "Author": "S. Flask", "ReviewID": "R3JUXRALFRJJ7U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "first, a bit of background so you understand where this review is coming from: i am used to shooting with very responsive equipment and lenses.  i'm also used to carrying around this very responsive and, generally, rather bulky equipment.  in an effort to shed some of the bulk at times, i have had my eye on the micro 4/3 market for a while, as well as new offerings from Sony and Nikon, as well as the Fuji x100 and, finally, the Fuji x10.in the end i decided to try the fuji x10 above all others mentioned for several reasons:- the 28-112 focal length is extremely useful, and wonderfully quick at f/2-2.8- no interchangeable lenses means i don't have to start collecting more equipment (my wallet and wife are thankful)- the fuji x10 was priced quite a bit lower than the other aforementioned options, especially considering you don't have to buy additional lenses- i understood that i was going to make some image quality trade offs by going with a smaller sensor, but was willing to roll the dice on fuji, as they seem to be on to something as of late- i liked the ergonomics of the camera, and the fact that it gave me easy access to all major functions (iso, shutter speed, aperture, AF point selection, AF drive, etc)- it had a viewfinder that didn't require me to spend a lot more money as an add-onafter using this camera for a bit, here are some initial observations on its functionality:- the viewfinder, which i thought was going to be terrible, isn't as bad as expected.  that said, it's not great if you're coming from a DSLR or good EVF.  it's nice and bright, and clear.  on the downside there is zero information in the viewfinder, and you have to contend with (expected) parallax, so i find that i'm using it only when the screen isn't the best way to compose.  this is hard for me, as i'm a huge fan of composing in the viewfinder, and i find myself frequently putting the camera up to my face only to realize i need to be focusing with the screen instead.  i suspect this will take some getting used to.  know that if you expect to use this camera primarily with the optical viewfinder you may be disappointed.  you should try it out and see what you think.- fuji should have put some type of anti-finger print coating on the front of the viewfinder.  (the type of coating that some filter manufacturers are now using)  the front element of the viewfinder seems to always get covered with finger prints, no matter how hard you try to keep it clean, and this clouds up the view.- the mode dial, shutter, exposure compensation and zoom ring are all of excellent quality, feel good to use and are easy to operate.- the main command dial on the back (which you will frequently use to adjust aperture or shutter speed values) feels good to operate, however i find that i frequently knock it out of position, changing accidentally changing whatever value it's controlling.  i'm not sure how to fix this.  there's not much space to put it elsewhere.  perhaps if it were a bit harder to turn it would help.- the sub-command dial is oddly cheap feelings on a camera where everything else feels very solid.  it has no detent and therefore spins too easily and feels kind of loose.  this is by no means a deal breaker, just a minor annoyance.  the camera, on the whole, is very well put together and feels solid.- there is an annoying camera shake alert that pops up onto the screen when shooting at slow shutter speeds that gets in the way of composing.  as far as i can tell, you can't turn this off.  i know when i'm shooting at a low shutter speed, and what the effects of this are, so i'd really prefer to be able to turn off this annoying \"WARNING!\" that pops up all the time.  (it looks like a little shaky camera on the display)- despite what i read, i found the menu layout to be very intuitive and easy to navigate.  i read the manual and basically had the functionality of this camera down in about 24 hours after receiving it.  if you've wrapped your head around the technicalities of a DSLR this really shouldn't pose a challenge.- the lack of shallow depth of field isn't really that big of an issue.  you CAN get shallow depth of field using wide apertures and longer focal lengths.  but one of the nice benefits of a large depth of field is that you can shoot at 28mm f/2 and NOT have extremely shallow depth of field.  this is very useful if you're shooting indoors in low light, because your DoF isn't razor thin, meaning your AF doesn't miss nearly as frequently as it might on a full frame DSLR.- the macro and super-macro modes are great!  i had zero expectation for macro ability, but i find myself using this often.  it's easy to turn on and allows you to get very close to your subject.  an unexpected plus.- the panorama function actually works.  i might be late to the party on this one.  i never expected it to be any good, but it really does work.  another unexpected plus.- the \"pro photo\" function that blow out backgrounds yields fairly cheesy results.  doesn't look like proper shallow DoF.  skip this one.- the expanded dynamic range and low light modes are nice to have.  and if you hand the camera to someone who knows nothing about photography and set it to EXR Auto, chances are they'll get usable results even in high contrast or low light situations.  these modes do reduce the resolution of the files, so use them sparingly if this is a concern.- why on earth do i have to change the ISO in every different camera mode instead of changing it once and having it carry over to other modes?  ISO is easily changed, but this is still kind of annoying.- the dedicated RAW button is ridiculous.  at least make it programmable so i can make it something else.  an easy firmware fix, no?- i found i was having faster AF times in low light without the AF assist beam.  try turning this off if you experience the same issue.  overall AF performance is pretty good.  not spectacular, not instant, but not slow enough that it's frustrating to use.  (i wouldn't buy this camera to shoot sports, obviously.)- the face of the camera is clean and doesn't draw a lot of attention to itself when shooting on the street.  the strap that comes with the camera is fine.  it does have some white branding on it, but it's easily covered up with a little tape or black sharpie, if, like me, you can't stand to have logos all over you.- speaking of shooting on the street, if you turn off the sounds on the X10 the camera is essentially silent.  this is fantastic.  if you use the viewfinder with your left eye you can see the AF confirmation light come on with your right eye, so you know you've locked focus even with the sound off and no confirmation in the viewfinder.now that i've gone on about using the camera, how about image quality?  first, the following impressions are only based on out of camera JPG files.  i plan to update this part of the review when the RAW files can be opened in Lightroom/Photoshop.  the included RAW conversion software, Silkypix, is absolutely horrible and i quit bothering trying to use it after a couple of days.  here's hoping lightroom 3.6 supports x10 RAW.if you are coming from something like an 18 or 24 megapixel DSLR, allow me to re-calibrate your expectations right off the bat.  this is NOT going to deliver DSLR image quality.  even inexpensive DSLR image quality.  if  you are used to working on your RAW files in Lightroom/Aperture/Photoshop, and frequently view them at 100%, you might have a minor heart attack when you open up in-camera JPG files from the X10.  (we'll see how this changes when we can really dig into the RAW files.)out of camera JPG's are very nice up to about ISO 800.  ISO 1600 aren't bad a lot of the time, but sometimes the noise is a bit much.  low light images at ISO 3200 aren't good for anything but viewing at snapshot size.  i even fiddled with the NR settings (turn it down a bit, IMO, unless you want the image to look like plastic) but it didn't help the ISO 3200 files much.  applying some NR to the JPG files in lightroom helped a bit, but couldn't save the worst of the bunch.  this is where RAW processing may help a lot.  i'm hoping RAW processing in lightroom will make using ISO 3200 regularly usable.  we will have to wait and see.so, what do i think of the fuji x10 so far?  i like it quite a bit, actually.  it feels great in the hand, is fairly intuitive to use and has a very nice feature set.  fuji has made a nice little camera here.  a good substitute when you don't want to walk around with your DSLR and a camera bag.  a good alternative when you don't feel like going down the road of another camera system like micro 4/3 or Nex (not that these systems are bad at all).  i'm happy with the image quality, although i would like to see high ISO cleaned up a bit, as i really do shoot in low light regularly.  i'll plan to update this part of my review when RAW support is enabled in lightroom.  all told, considering the sensor size it's really not bad.  but i want a lot of bang for my buck!december 13th update:  adobe has just released new versions of Lightroom and ACR with support for X10 RAW files.december 14th update:  a few impressions after working with the RAW files in Lightroom:  my main desire was to try to tame high iso noise in lightroom.  i think it's safe to say that if you expose the image properly, you can get a useable result at ISO 3200.  certainly useable for online use, or prints MAYBE up to 8x10 or so upon first impression.  and that's pushing it - that's if the stars align.  i feel comfortable using the X10 at ISO 1600, and if i calibrate my expectations accordingly, 3200.  as i mentioned before, this is NOT a DSLR, and you have to adjust your expectations accordingly.  there's a lot of fine noise at 3200, so you have to watch your sharpening and make sure you're not applying too much detail sharpening, and are using appropriate amounts of masking.  don't go overboard on the luminance noise reduction, either.  if you accept that an ISO 3200 image is going to be a small image in its final stage, you don't have to obliterate all the noise.  cranking up the NR can turn these really high ISO images to mush pretty quickly.  go easy.  expose to the right.  i'm really talking about high ISO files here.  everything from ISO 100 to 800 is great, in my opinion, and 1600 is good.  this is a pretty decent working range for such a small camera/sensor.i am now shooting RAW + JPEG, whereas with my DSLR i only shoot RAW.  the reason for this is that the X10 does a really nice job handling the JPEG files at moderate ISO's.  they need a bit more contrast and clarity for my taste, which is an easy preset to setup in Lightroom.  i find that i can skip dealing with the RAW conversion if i'm happy with the JPEG output, which is often the case.  the \"fuji colors\" that everyone mentions are real - they're fantastic.  there's another reason not to write off JPEG:  the extras.  you can't shoot RAW in EXR modes, nor can you shoot RAW in the panorama mode or advanced modes like \"pro low light\", and it's hard to know if you're better off with an out of camera JPEG from one of these modes than a RAW file.  one of the quirks of this camera is there are  multiple ways to get from point A to point B, and it's not always clear which way is best.  so when you want that perfect low light shot maybe you take a single RAW exposure at high iso, wide aperture.  or maybe you use the pro low light mode, which combines four images taken back to back, and that gives you a JPEG only result.  the answer isn't always cut and dry, and it seems practice is going to be the only way to hash it out.  it seems the X10 can be as complicated or as simple as you want it to be, for better or for worse.  (personally, i doesn't bother me.  but fuji could have done a better job with the manual, which is definitely lacking.)update 12/22/11:  if you're looking into this camera you may have read about the \"white disc\" problem.  this has not been a problem in most of the images i've taken, however i have seen it and it does exist.  it seems to show up most in low ISO/low light/longer shutter speed situations where there are specular highlights.  i've corrected the issue in these situations by choosing a higher ISO and not leaving the camera on auto ISO, where it will occasionally pick a much lower ISO than i would personally choose in lower light situations.  overall this isn't a huge issue for me, as i've seen it infrequently and can usually get rid of it when it does occur, but your mileage may vary.  i do consider this to be a fault, and it should be fixed.  fuji apparently has a firmware update in the works to address the issue.  whether or not this will be an issue for you will depend on your subject matter, how you use the camera, and how prone you are to ruminating on imperfections.  if you're looking to shoot lower ISO, long exposure images with spectral highlights, i would avoid this camera until fuji resolves the issue.update 1/11/12:  it would be extremely helpful if fuji issued a firmware update that made it so the light on the back didn't blink during low shutter speed situations.  the reason for this is as follows:  if you're shooting in low light, and using the optical viewfinder, your only focus confirmation (if you have the sounds off) is when the confirmation light illuminates, which you can see with your right eye while you use your left eye to compose.  when focus doesn't lock the light flashes.  the problem is that the light flashes when focus DOES lock but the shutter speed is low, supposedly to alert you that there may be camera shake.  the problem here is that when it flashes you can't tell if you haven't locked focus, or if the shutter speed is simply low.  assuming you already know that your shutter speed is low, the alert is useless and makes it so you have no way of knowing if you've missed focus or not.  i know this sounds like i'm being picky, but if you want to frequently use the OVF in low light you'll see why this is an issue.one final note about functionality, and i think i'll put an end to this ongoing review of the X10:  the X10 is a very different experience from the X100 (or DSLR for that matter), for one simple reason:  the viewfinder.  with no information in the viewfinder at all, shooting this camera in manual, aperture or shutter priority modes causes you to do one very big thing differently - look at the LCD.  with the X100, you can keep your attention in the viewfinder, adjusting the aperture/shutter speed/iso without ever taking the camera away from your face.  with the X10 you have to look at the LCD any time you want to make a change.  if you're the type of person who doesn't mind composing with and frequently using the LCD, this isn't really an issue for you.  but if you're the type who can't stand composing with the LCD (that's me), or your other camera is a DSLR where you almost never use the LCD to change settings because you can do it all by heart with the camera to your eye, you'll find this to be a pretty big deal.  in my opinion it takes your head out of the game - it requires too much effort to make very small changes.  the end result is that a camera like the X10 provides more of a point & shoot experience, and the presence of the (very good) EXR mode on the dial seems to confirm this.  so if you're looking for a stripped down, manual photography experience, i think the X10 is going to disappoint.  but if you're approaching the X10 from a more modest point & shoot angle, it'll likely satisfy you and then some.  it's a very capable little camera.p.s. fuji has fixed the sensor issue.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good companion to X100", "Author": "MeridianX", "ReviewID": "R3MFYDLXH3IYWQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a proud owner of a Fujifilm X100.  The X100, as much as I love it, is a bit large and heavy and the fixed lens limits its' use in certain situations.  As such, I could not wait for the X10.  Overall the camera lives up to the \"little brother of the X100\" tag line.  Quality is simple top notch!  It is also, obviously, much more portable than the X100. The \"on\" mode with the lens is a far superior idea to the \"on/off\" switch on the x100.  While there is no comparison to the awesome viewfinder of X100, this viewfinder works well and is welcomed while shooting in bright sun.  It reacts immediately while you are zooming the lens.  I would, however, love to see the next version have the eye sensor like the X100 that switches off the screen display when you put your up to the viewfinder.  Regarding general picture IQ (without pixel peeping) you can barely tell the difference between pictures taken with the X100.  When pictures are shown to \"normal\" people, of the same subject taken with both cameras, most could not tell the difference with shots taken outdoors in daylight and/ or shots printed up to 5x7.  On the computer, while looking at pictures taken with higher ISO's, there does appears to be some smearing I think due to some noise reduction kicking in.  Regarding the zoom, it is great feature to have after constantly using your feet as the zoom while using the X100.  Quickly, while shooting with a flash, you are reminded you have to remember to use a rangefinder hold while using the zoom (hand under the lens not to the side) otherwise you will find yourself blocking the flash during shooting.  Also the thumb does not seem to have a natural resting point but after a while I didn't notice the initial weirdness.  I did note that the battery does seem to get rather warm while rapidly shooting (actually warming the memory card).  While the battery does appear to deplete rather quickly that may be because I am currently not using the viewfinder, relying on the display screen (which is quite nice) and I was shooting with the \"power save\" mode off.  One last note, I did find that the white balance is not as accurate indoors as the X100 nor what I would like.  The camera has some trouble in \"Auto\" shooting with the flash while in a room lit by an incandescent light. (There isn't a \"flash\" WB setting, perhaps that would help.)  ...Hopefully Fuji can work on this in a future firmware upgrade.  Regarding shooting speed, the X10 captures pictures faster than the X100.  The X10 seems almost instantaneous.  I am still playing with the camera but overall I find it it to be a very unique camera that is perfect for the person who appreciates the manual manipulations to get the shot the way you envision it.  Because of the manual manipulations generally necessary the X10 would not be the camera I would recommend to a casual snapshooter or someone new to digital cameras.  I would, however, recommend it if you enjoy Fuji cameras and are looking for a nice portable camera that can take pictures with a shallow Depth of Field and immediately shift to take a sharp landscape photo while doing it all with style...Update:  Nov 26, 2011The more experience I have with the camera the more I reach for it when going on excursions.  The EXR feature is something that the X100 doesn't have so I decided to test it out more thoroughly.  My experience has been that it is remarkable in the way it analyzes the scene and sets itself up for the shot...it is akin to a super intelligent \"Auto\" mode.  Handing off the camera to my son or wife while placing the camera in EXR mode and we are guaranteed very good shots.  Also, since the camera is very quick from shot to shot, the bracketing function allows you to make good use of Dynamic range and film simulation bracketing that has allowed me to capture a range of shots without fumbling through menus to change parameters individually.  BTW, I found the standard film setting (Provia) is a good for people shots, while I favor the \"S\" (Astia) setting gives a bit more color punch.  Bracketing the film simulation lets you spend less time trying to tweak saturation via software.  Also, I found that the high speed picture taking provides for less blurry shots as the fast autofocus is very accurate.  Also, I had a chance to closely compare the X10 with my wife's new Canon S100.  I realize that this was an unfair comparison because they are different types of cameras and there is a rather big difference in price but since I own them both I couldn't resist!  Bottom line is the X10 is better built, resolves detail better, is cleaner at higher ISO settings, manual zoom, focuses much faster, great skin tones and has a very good viewfinder.  The S100 colors accuracy appears equal but with a bit more saturation, is pocketable, has the same amount of battery life as X10, has a retractable lens cap, and some cool special effects (miniature & toy camera).  ALso, as the Canon does \"in-camera\" HDR, I did a comparison with the X10 Dynamic range set at 400%.  The Canon camera requires a tripod during HDR capture as the slightest movement results in a blurry picture.  As expected, the Canon picture does result in noticeable expanded dynamic range in the end picture (it should as it is combining three separate photos).  The X10 picture appears to almost match the range but looks much more natural like a normal photograph.  Also, since no tripod is required for the X10, I end up using the DR expansion often.  Oddly, while comparing all my X10 DR pictures, the best DR pictures seem to come when the camera is set to a \"Medium\" file size, DR at 400%, ISO at 100.  Anyway, my wife still likes the Canon better since she can pocket it, the X10 is my go to travel camera.To see an image of my X10 with the optional Fuji Lens Hood/ Adapter see my review at Fujifilm Lens Hood X10 for Digital CameraJanuary 2012 : While looking for a spare lens cap to keep with me while traveling, I came across an interesting lens cap.  While it has some limitations, it is reasonably priced and has been useful in certain photographic situations.  A mini review can be found here EzFoto Auto Lens Cap / Lens Hood for Fuji Finepix X10", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazingly capable small point and shoot", "Author": "Tim Kimzey \"fstop\"", "ReviewID": "R17S8YU1DRLWR7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been eyeing this camera since it was first announced. But then some of the negative reviews and tests started coming out and i almost forgot about and dismissed it.For background, i work as a photojournalist (over 25 years) using DSLR's on a daily basis. The only \"point-and-shoot\" i've owned was a now very dated Nikon Coolpix 5000. I used it for a few years for some snapshooting but was never happy with it, and hadn't thought much about getting another snapshooter camera until recently. Mostly wanted something small and light to shoot while on hikes, vacation, family snapshots. But wanted something that could be used with manual control and easy to do so. In contrast, although the newer 4/3's cameras with interchangeable lenses are nice, and getting on the level of higher image quality, i could care less. I own multiple higher-end DSLR bodies (starting with a D1) with dozens of lenses from 8mm fisheye to 300/2.8. I personally did not want to pay for another entire system. Plus that defeats the purpose of having a small carry-anywhere camera with one integral lens. If you are not in my situation, i can understand if you want a system to begin with, but the way i look at it, no matter how good the smaller cameras get, the bigger ones with bigger sensors are always going to have better image quality. Plus many of the small system's lenses are still pricey and don't have a good range yet, and they are not that fast. They are not going to compete with a full-frame 85 f/1.4 for sharpness, resolution, bokeh.So, after much careful study of various models and the assurance that Fuji would either fix the sensor issue (highlight orbs) or i could possibly be lucky enough to get a newer one with the new sensor, i made the plunge. Luckily so far i've found no highlight orbs in my photos! For reference, my copy is #22AD---- (purchased from Amazon Sept2012), which i've read may possibly be a second quarter 2012 manufacture. Can't substantiate that, but i think Fuji should just go ahead and make a note which copies have a newer sensor (for their own good even)at point of sale, with the box. If you do have an older version, from what i've heard Fuji is being very good about fixing it and returning it to customers in a timely manner. It's a shame they didn't R&D; the problem before initial manufacture/release, because i think this has really tarnished the reputation of a great little camera. And i think the problem may have been exaggerated a bit, beyond all the good qualities of the camera:It seems well-made. Mostly metal. Solid with good button control and tactile feel, zoom ring has very smooth action. Personally i LOVE the on/off on the zoom ring and think it's a great idea. Not sure why some reveiwers dont like it. Amazing nice exposure compensation dial right at your thumb with good resistance--shouldn't ever move accidently. Great main control dial with options that can be accessed fast and smooth without going into those horrid menu systems! In fact, most functions that you want to use regularly do not need to be menu-accessed (Yaaaah!) Even the video mode can just be set on the main dial and you just use the shutter button to shoot. I've read complaints of people wanting separate buttons for video functions, and i just think that is not user-friendly. This is a well thought-out camera.Another reason i chose this camera is for the optical viewfinder. Most P/S's are ditching them. I'm over 40 and my eyesight isn't as good close-up now ;)Also, i don't want to always hold the camera out in front of me. First of all, after shooting pictures professionally for many years, it just aint intuitive, you dont have as good a hold on the camera, it does not steady the camera with a three-point system for slower shutter speeds. Also, it bright sunlight you cannot see that screen so good. Granted, the viewfinder suffers from parallax, isnt quite 100% coverage, and doesnt have info inside. But it still HAS IT when i want to use it.Love that is has a flash shoe. Havent used it much as of yet, but i can pop a manual radio slave on top of it and fire multiple strobes and studio lights if i want to. AND the camera's flash sync is an amazing 1/4000 sec.--much better than the newest Nikon DSLR (D600) at 1/200th! The tiny pop-up flash actually works quite well with decent coverage and color balance, more importantly it seems to provide very accurate exposure without blowing out the scene. You can even set the exposure compensation for the flash.Really like that it includes a full 1080p video mode with built-in stereo mics, the panorama mode works quite well (as long as you dont have moving subjects in frames) and the Pro-Focus mode does do something (creates multiple images at various focus points to achieve a better bokeh supposedly) but not terribly well. Coming from someone that uses very fast prime lenses on a daily basis, it doesnt compare, but at least its a good idea and i like that Fuji was thinking about it, and it does help some with a stationary subjects.MACRO. The good and the bad: It has amazing macro-focus capability, 1cm in front of the lens in fact. And you can achieve a nice soft out-of-focus look in the background. But unfortunately, the MFD (minimum focus distance) is only possible at the wide-angle setting of the lens, not at the long (112mm)end. You can still get relatively close with the longer focal length, but if you could at 85mm or so, this camera would be utterly awesome (Too bad). I still think it does a good job, but macro works better with a longer focal lens. You will be touching a bug, flower, or whatever. Your light source then gets blocked by the lens, casting shadow on the subject. And has distortion (wide angle warp) of the lens. So love that it can focus so close with good bokeh, but could be sooo much better if you could use the longer end of the zoom lens.AF is usually pretty responsive and accurate. Better than i thought it would be in fact. The camera starts up immediately and the shutter is instantaneous.The lens focal range is around 28mm to 112mm (compared to 35mm). Wish it was a little wider especially (24 at least) and it could be longer too, but it still has a decent range. The good thing is that it is FAST f/2 to f/2.8--thats much better than most small P/S's and probably the MAIN REASON  i bought this camera. You can shoot with lower light at lower ISO's, keep the background soft, etc. This is a very good quality of this lens, and it is SHARP even wide-open at ANY focal length!The images are pretty sharp, detail/resolution is quite decent for this small sensor size. Color and white balance is generally good. I like the film simulation modes, esp. the B/W with sepia and \"filters\"(green, yellow, red). Yes this is a twist on old-school and if you dont know what it does, look it up. I understand you can just convert the images to grayscale in Photoshop, but i still like it, and it makes the camera fun to use like film days. I'm not so sure the color film simulations are that accurate (i've shot my own bulk-loaded 100' rolls of Fujichrome too), but its still a good idea. It makes you feel like you are shooting film again, and THINK differently.The camera can shoot infrared images. Another selling point as i had an old (expensive) B+W infrared filter that i wanted to use on this camera. (You can determine with a P/S if you point your TV's remote into the lens and push a button--you can see the light in the LCD monitor).Which brings us to one of the things i DO NOT like about the camera, the stupid filter diameter size. I bought the knock-off step-up (52mm) ring/hood. It works good, looks even better, but the holes in the back let in dust (and light--that wouldnt work for infrared) and block even more of the image when looking thru viewfinder. So i finally found what i wanted-- a 40-46mm step-up ring. I then put a standard 46mm UV filter on that. It is almost perfectly flush with the rest of the zoom ring/lens, is solid and doesn't let dust in. I can screw my infrared filter into it too, and it works great. The lens cap doesn't fit well, but i don't care cause i never use one since i have a protector filter on the front of every lens. THe included cap is metal and nice, but i put it back in the box.I do have a cheap protective film for the back LCD, and i have a \"soft\" screw-in shutter release button attached. Other than that it's a very nice self-contained camera for great street-shooting, hiking, etc. It is quite small--smaller than thought from the photos even--will fit in a larger coat pocket though.I'm very happy with this little point and shoot camera. It's capable of getting good images, and most importantly, i ENJOY shooting with it!!The look is retro too, and its very sharp-looking, but it also makes you FEEL like you are using a \"real\" vintage camera, and you WANT to be CREATIVE using it. Well done, FujiFilm.UPDATES--  (I'll try to add to this section as i use the camera more)Battery life. It's OK, not great but i haven't found it to be terribly bad either as some have alluded to. It has a pretty small battery rated at 1000mAh. That said, you can find third-party batteries that fit, easily and cheaply. I've bought 4 here on Amazon, two are rated at 1100mAh, 2 are rated at 1400mAh--i don't really believe the manufacturer/seller's rated amperages, but they all work fine in the camera though, as well as the Fuji-branded one (and they only cost a couple of bucks a piece!)The BAD thing is that the battery level meter in the camera is not too informative and/or accurate...seems to die almost immediately after it first shows a lower level. But it does seem to work strong until that point at least. Just make sure you buy extra (cheap) batteries and keep them with you and the camera. I'd think this was something that could easily be corrected with a firmware update.", "Date": "September 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is my first Fuji (digital) product!", "Author": "Christian X", "ReviewID": "R196CP2L4HFR4Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was always a Nikon for \"still image\" and a bit of a Canon for \"camcorder\" - never thought of buying a Fujifilm digital camera.When they announced the X10, I was immediately hooked; the bright f2.0-2.8 lens is a key factor and the fact that it is not an interchangeable lens camera with classic styling (dials, and retro looks)-makes me want to just have one!I pre-ordered it from Amazon but then they ran out of stock for some reason and it was in stock here (in a local camera store nearby) and so I went to that store and tested a bunch of other cameras like the E-P3, Nikon 1, and the X10. Yes, E-P3 is very nice, and it is micro 4/3rds; feels good and fast AF. Tried the Nikon 1 V1 and J1, the J1 feels solid and good when held; cool 10 to 60 fps shooting (awesome stuff) and blazing AF! the V1 feels and looks very bulky though (it's like holding a small brick); but inside is pretty much powerful.I decided not to get the E-P3 because it is $899 with the kit lens, and that means if I want a faster lens like the f2.0 I have to get it separately and spend hundreds of dollars; if not I'm stuck with the kit lens, which I think it's alright, but still (limiting) for low light situation. The J1 and V1 is great, I've loved Nikon and their image quality performance, always been satisfied. I have no idea why people are making 'their decision to put a smaller sensor' a big deal, the images coming out of J1 and V1 are pretty much comparable to Olympus E-P3 and in fact, the J1/V1 produce cleaner image with high ISO.The reason I'm not getting the Nikon 1 is because lack of direct dials (aperture/shutter speed/ISO controls) I have to go to the menu for that stuff, but still, not bad; although I prefer having them around especially it's priced at >$640ish. Their lens selection are still quite limited, I want an option for a faster zoom lens (don't like the pancake with only f2.8).SO, I came to a decision to get the X10. This camera has the retro looks, classic dials (fast access) and fun to shoot with; size is just right and feels good b/c that magnesium alloy body material; I like the Fujinon lens to be honest, Nikkor, Fujinon and Leica are my favorites; I like X10's bright and fast lens f2.0-f2.8(telephoto) makes it real good for low light shooting.I like that it has a standard hotshoe and a pop up flash (a good one at least). and an optical viewfinder (I don't use it a lot but it's nice to have one). I also like the RAW shooting features on this camera. The LCD screen is a bit of a let down since I was using a Nikon P300 before and the P300 has a very nice and bright 960k resolution as for the X10 only 460k dot. but it's fine!X10 does a good job on the super macro, the AF is pretty fast but not faster than the J1 or the V1 or even with the E-P3 but not slow either (it failed to focus rarely).The one thing I don't like with this camera is the software, I wish it can be like Nikon, less animation and lag; for example when I'm erasing an image, it does the \"dissolve\" animation and that takes time really..even just a millisecond.Other than the software, this camera is the BOMB! for the price $600, it's a FINE pocket camera, looks very professional, and produces great images (which by the way comparable to the J1 and V1, even some micro 4/3rds cameras out there).The sensor is 2/3\" so it's larger than those Nikon's P7100 or the Canon G12 and that's just great.Video? yes, it does 1080p video, I haven't play much with this feature but so far it shoots a great video, a little bit better than my P300, but for stabilization, I prefer the P300 (less shaky when recording). The Panorama feature looks neat, haven't play with it a lot, but so far I like Nikon P300's panorama feature better, I might be wrong, I'll post an update after playing with it for a couple of weeks.I bought this camera for a professional image quality look (in a compact size) and it does the job wonderfully.Go get this camera when it's in stock, worth the money and yep, I'm a happy Fuji customer now!I'm hoping for a firmware/software update though ;)Cheers.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "This Fuji hits my spot", "Author": "E. Hung", "ReviewID": "R1YLYJ8E6UYR3Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is supposed to be my wife 's X'mas gift and it doesn't seem to turn out that way as I have been spending more time than her with this camera. To give you some background, I myself have already owned a Canon EOS 7D DSLR and a Sigma DP2S compact camera. While the Sigma is compact and excels in image quality when light is sufficient, it remains sluggish. It 's like an old man. Compared to the Sigma, the Fuji X10 is like an energetic pretty young lady. Fuji really knows how to market this thing by capitalizing its success on the X100.I originally was considering getting the SONY NEX-5N for my wife, but there were a couple of issues swaying me from SONY to Fuji. First, there was this clicking noise thing with the NEX-5N during video recording. Unfortunately, SONY screwed up and released the camera too soon without thorough QA. Despite the fact that SONY has offered new NEX-5N owners with free repair, I didn't want to deal with the hassle. I wanted a camera that worked out of the box for my wife as it was supposed to be a surprise gift. Because of this hesitation, I had a little more time to look at other cameras including the Nikon 1 series and even Micro 4/3.From the beginning, I didn't really like the Nikon 1 series at all. When a camera company employed Ashton Kutcher for its commercials and introduced a new line of camera with a pink body option, I knew I would try to disassociate myself from it, although my wife might have thought otherwise. For the record, our first digicam was a Nikon. So no offense to Nikon fanboys. I did actually try out the J1 at my local Best Buy. The J1 's AF was screaming fast. However, it lacked a PASM mode dial and VR seemed to be not as effective as I had expected. After some pixel peeping at Fuji X10 's captured images, I would say its IQ is on par with Nikon 1 series'. Another important thing to consider is that Nikon J1 is made in China and is priced higher than Fuji X10, which is made in Japan. The metal material on Nikon J1 body does not seem to be made out of magnesium alloy. It has a color coating similar to my Yashica EZ-F521 Chinese knockoff. On the other hand, the Fuji X10 really feels substantial in my hands. Its body feels really solid similar to my Canon EOS 7D.As for Micro 4/3, here you have Panasonic GF series and its latest pricey GX1, apart from the confusing and constantly revised Olympus PEN series. I almost clicked the buy button when the Panny GF2 was selling at $299 a couple weeks ago. However, I resisted. While my wife might have been glad to settle with the GF2 since she had owned a Lumix point and shoot before and liked it, I felt that Panasonic had not really made much progress in CMOS sensor advancement. Quite a few online reviewers like Steve Huff were saying that the Fuji X10 and Nikon 1 were as good as micro 4/3 in terms of IQ. And don't forget their sensors are smaller than Micro 4/3's. On top of that, Fuji X10 has a secret recipe which is its EXR technology. By pixel binning and doubling up the pixels in each color channel while sacrificing the sensor resolution by half, the X10 could either increase dynamic range in high contrast situations or reduce high ISO noise without sacrificing details in low light conditions. In the former case, it is similar to shooting HDR without the use of a tripod. With the X10, you can now capture HDR-like images with subjects in motion without the need of exposure bracketing and morphing multiple frames into one image. How cool is that? But then you only get 6 megapixels out of it. So what? Are you going to make large prints out of this compact camera? In essence, the most important feature with the Fuji X10 is its EXR mode. It can be found in the PASM mode dial. EXR mode is similar to iAuto of Panasonic Lumix except that Fuji 's version is more intelligent. The camera would analyze the scene and determine for you whether to apply more dynamic range or more noise reduction using its proprietary EXR recipe. This is a truly brain dead point and shoot to get the best image out of the camera. And I 've found it performed consistently well in my first few days of use. Image stablization also works nicely indoor. I could get pretty good still images around 1/8s shutter speed consistently. Well, not having a mirror flapping up and down did help.Since I have an interchangeable lens system already, I didn't want my wife to become another lens snob like me as I have already owned a bunch of lenses for my EOS 7D. This is pretty much my biggest gripe if I were to go with SONY NEX. The Fuji X10 features a built-in fast zoom lens. Unlike other compact cameras with built-in zoom lens, the Fuji X10 tops off at F2.8 when you zoom out to the telephoto end. This is quite a bit of advantage in terms of capturing freeze motion of your subjects in the entire zoom range. Another advantage of the built-in lens is that the sensor would be less prone to dust. Even though my EOS 7D has anti-static coating and ultrasound vibration in its sensor, I still need to clean it from time to time as I change lenses a lot in the field.As far as AF is concern, the Fuji X10 is quite snappy. There is one cool feature in its face recognition. The X10 could register a few captured faces in its memory and allow the AF to prioritize its focus to these registered faces upon recognized by the camera. Although I have not tried it yet, I think this is a pretty cool feature. This would be extremely useful if you let some brain dead strangers to take pictures of yourself and your family among other background pedestrians.Regarding the video recording function of Fuji X10, it really puts my Canon EOS 7D to shame. Besides full HD 1080p/30, the X10 supports dynamic auto focus, auto adjustment of exposure, and even auto adjustment of white balance, all without significant lag when you pan the camera around the scene. It performs just like my old Digital 8 SONY Camcorder. No more fiddling with exposure knob and focus ring. I am jealous at my wife now. I will update more about video recording once we get more experience with it.Another important feature worth mentioning is the super macro mode. Since the X10 sensor is relatively small, it allows you to capture a magnified image of your subject better than a DSLR with a non-macro lens. Your working distance can be about an inch away. The super macro mode works very well especially it gives you more depth of field on the subject with the relatively small sensor. I actually prefer this than using the macro lens on my EOS 7D where I would normally have to go F11 or beyond to achieve more depth of field and bring the whole subject body into focus. If the light condition is not good, I would have to use flash, which is not my preference.So there you have it. A nice compact camera with beautiful retro styling packed with Fuji 's advanced EXR technology. Have I mentioned the price yet? Oh $599 may be a bit steep for most people. One would argue that you could almost get an entry level DSLR for that kind of money. At first I agreed and thought this camera should have been priced slightly above the Oly XZ-1 or Canon G12. But then when you look at it closely and check the images posted on X10 Group under Flickr, you would find this little camera really stands up against the bigger Micro 4/3. I told myself why not give it a try as I am intrigued by Fuji EXR sensor, which in my opinion is still inferior to Sigma Foveon sensor in broad day light. I figured that the opportunity cost would be the loss of our enjoyment if I have waited for the X10 price to drop when competition catches up. Yes, people are willing to pay a premium for new cool stuff. There are also reasons why people want to buy a Lexus over a Toyota even though some of their models are the same cars.I think most reviewers have covered other technical stuff on the Fuji X10 and I don't want to re-iterate other highlights. There isn't really much low light worth mentioning from me unless I want to nitpick this thing to death. I want to offer potential buyers another perspective in terms of choosing the right camera for their needs. You have to decide what your priorities first. For instance, if I were a starter in serious photography, I would not have picked the Fuji X10. I could get an entry level DSLR or even SONY NEX with more bangs for the buck. I would say this Fuji X10 is a very good companion to any serious photographer who has already had another main camera body for serious work. The X10 is meant for fun and casual. Don't treat its image quality too seriously like your DSLR. Just get a Sigma or any latest DSLR if image quality is your top priority. The Fuji X10 is perfect for street photography. It 's discrete and quiet. It draws no attention in the crowd. You could switch it to silence mode and nobody would even notice you taking pictures of them. With the cool looking hood, you would draw conversation from fellow photographers. It could even be your pick up line. Without any commitment to an interchangeable lens system, you can almost view the Fuji X10 as a good one night stand. A very good one with a smile indeed.And one more thing. There have been some discussion in dpreview.com about white orbs appearing in blown out highlight areas. So far, touch wood, I have not encountered such problem in my first few days of use. I tried to shoot at some reflective surfaces and light sources. I did not find any white blobs or dots what-so-ever in my images. If I ever do, and hopefully not, I would update this review accordingly.Update 12/6/11:After spending a couple more days deliberately shooting at reflective surfaces and light sources, I think I 've found on one occasion where there was a cluster of white orbs. I didn't see these orbs on X'mas tree nor any shiny surfaces both indoor and outdoor. The orbs appeared when I shot directly at the sun. The center spot of the sun in the captured image was a cluster of orbs with radiating light rays, whereas my other cameras would normally show one circular radiating star. It 's not that bad, not a show stopper for me. Perhaps this could be a calibration issue with the camera's analog front end since a handful of users claimed they saw more orbs than usual. I 'll trust that Fuji would fix it in its next firmware upgrade. Remember, cameras like this requires very high precision engineering and manufacturing. I wouldn't be surprised that there are defect escapes when new model is first released. In the past, I have bought a lemon lens and a defective speedlight from Canon to give you an idea. This is no worse than the dreadful red dot issue when the Nikon D7000 and Canon 5D MK2 were first released. That 's why I don't pre-order, and I always purchase from Amazon, Adorama, J&R;, or BH photo so that I can return for exchange or refund immediately.Update 12/14/11:The face recognition really works marvelously. You can register faces of your partner, family members, or friends and the camera would name those faces when you look into the LCD viewfinder while taking your shot. It would even recognize the same face with or without eye glasses. Wonderful handy feature. Also I have not seen any white orb after over two weeks of usage. I believe my copy is a keeper. I would be cautious about upgrading the firmware once Fuji has it available for fixing the white orb syndrome.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "If you're aware of its issues, you'll not regret your purchase", "Author": "cal jazz", "ReviewID": "R1A4RR3LD7HKZK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wasn't sure I should add to the hundreds of comprehensive reviews of this camera, both here and elsewhere, because I am not a professional photographer--but maybe I can help a few people decide.I should first say that I did not buy this on Amazon, but paid what was at the time a lower price at a reputable dealer that I assume Amazon will soon match.  (If I'm allowed to mention the price, in late June, 2012 it was in the mid $400s). This put the camera still at the higher end of compact cameras, though still well below the Canon G1x and the Sony Rx100, and definitely at the low end of the micro 4/3rds, especially when lenses are added in. This price comparison I think is important, because in my three weeks of use, I have found the image quality to be  excellent, and though I am sure the other cameras I mention above might produce better, I'm not sure it would be better for the money.In addition, I have enjoyed the flexibility of a variety of settings--especially the ability to save groups of settings--the substantial feel of the camera, the quality lens that still provides relative range without carrying around a bunch of different lenses, the low light abilities, the sharp macro picture possibilities, and the built in panorama feature. So this camera is really working for me, and if the price continues to drop, it could actually become a bargain.But, of course, if you read all the reviews, you know there are issues with the camera.  Here is my take on those issues as an amateur photographer, based on a several week experience:1.  I have not had the \"orb\" problem--the uneditable white spots that appear with glare.  My camera's serial number begins with 21A so maybe it has one of the newer sensors produced to solve the problem.  At the same time, I have not at all had the noise problem in low light that some people have complained about with the new sensors.  In fact, I think low light performance is great in this camera, in part because the fast lens.2. The viewfinder is partially blocked by the lens, but I still use it all the time.  In fact, that is one of the reasons I got this camera, because I have never liked taking pictures by using an lcd screen. Am I sometimes surprised by what appears in the lower right corner of my composition?  Yes.  On the other hand, a little minor cropping eliminates the bad surprises, and sometimes the surprise is a good one.3. As a number of reviews have said, I've found it really hard to produce adjusted pictures of high quality working from \"raw.\" With other cameras, I always liked to shoot in raw--I use Lightroom for conversion and processing.  But I'm not sure its worth it for this camera.  Still, the jpegs are excellent, so it isn't as much a problem as you might think.4. Because of the peculiarities of Fuji's sensor, for many of the settings you have to lower image resolution to \"medium\" that is, 6 megapixels.  I have to admit, that kind of bugged me at first, because cropping is a bit limited at that resolution.  Fortunately, picture quality is high even in medium.5. In bright sunlight, if I am shooting aperture priority and trying to keep a shallow depth of field, I find the pictures to be slightly overexposed for my tastes, even at ISO 100. But that's where the handy exposure compensation dial comes in--its quickly turned and once you find the setting that works for bright light, it is easier than a menu driven adjustment to exposure that other cameras have.  I'm sure I could find appropriate shutter speeds and get those set and saved in conjunction with aperture, but the dial does make it easy. In situations where I don't mind stopping down, there's no problem with exposure. And a lot of times, I just find it easy to let the camera do all the work and set it to what Fuji weirdly calls \"EXR Auto\" as opposed to \"regular Auto\" which is also available.  My wife, who is scarcely interested in photography and therefore annoys me by often producing better pictures than I do,just sets it to EXR auto, treats the camera as a point and shoot and it works just fine.6.  The battery life is relatively short if you use the camera for movies.  I haven't much, but noticed when I did some video it really drained the battery quickly.  Even in still photographs, depending on what settings you use, you notice it from time to time. I had to change the battery once unexpectedly when taking a bunch of rapid continuous shots at a kid's baseball game (the shots came out great, by the way--got more than a few \"moment of contact\" pictures in batting.)  On the other hand, I've never had it run out on me on a hike when I'm just taking single pictures, and it lasted several days during a camping trip. I would just count on carrying an extra battery just in case, but the battery is cheap, so it doesn't add much expense.All in all, the issues are there, but, thanks to previous reviewers, I bought with my eyes wide open, and feel I got an excellent camera. I've produced some really sharp pictures--of the family, of landscapes, and of flowers.  I've not felt the need for additional lenses, and the camera is really easy to carry around on hikes and walks. So I would definitely recommend you give this camera serious consideration!", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simply put...\"Excellent\" !", "Author": "Trademark \"Trademark\"", "ReviewID": "R34O7Q2J8F70GR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think it is important that someone own, or at least have used, a camera before they submit a review on it. Given that, I'm not sure why anyone considering a purchase of this camera would be interested in a reviewer who says \"they hope it's a great camera\" or \"it will probably be a good camera\". There are a lot of discussion forums for that sort of thing. I'm betting that people want to hear from those of us who actually have the thing in our hands....so here goes.First my credentials. I'm an amateur photographer (at best). I enjoy photography and spend money on what I consider to be quality cameras. In addition to my Nikon D7000, I'm a proud owner of the Fujifilm x100. It has taught me a great deal about photography, especially framing shots and using my feet as my telephoto lens. I'm also the owner of a Canon S95, Panasonic DMC-LC1 (and previously owned the Leica Digilux 2), Sony Nex 5, and Panasonic LX5. I also previously owned a Panasonic GF1.Why so many small cameras you ask? Because I've never found that ONE that suited all my needs....until now. Don't get me wrong, the Fuji X10 isn't perfect and there are still some tradeoffs, but it is as close as I have come to finding the perfect camera for me.I have to be honest and say that my favorite camera, and model to which all others are measured, was my Leica Digilux 2. Great build, fantastic lens, and really  a great camera. However, it was rather large, only 5 megapixel, poor video performance and had a small sensor. As it aged, it just couldn't compete and I have long looked for a camera to adequately replace it and receive my \"favorite\" label. The X10 comes as close as a perfect replacement for that camera as you can get and I am amazed. It is my new favorite and I have it with me all of the time.First, it is really well-built, along the lines of the X100. Secondly, it is small......no, it's not as small as the Canon S95 or even the Panasonic LX5. You won't be able to put it in your shirt pocket, but it fits nicely in a coat pocket or purse. Secondly, it has both an LCD and optical viewfinder. True, the optical viewfinder has its limitations and isn't anywhere approaching the wonderful electronic/optical viewfinder on the X100, BUT it is built-in where many of the small footprint cameras require you to purchase an optical viewfinder as an add-on. The viewfinder comes in handy on sunny days. The AF focus is much faster than the X100.....not quite as fast as the Panasonic GF1, but still pretty good. I love the power on by rotating the lens! Very responsive camera. And what about the lens???? f2.0 - f2.8....Fantastic and oh, those Fuji colors.I could go on an on about all of the features, but those are listed elsewhere. What you really need to know is that this is a GREAT camera for anyone serious about photography. Well built, full featured, great photos, 4x optical zoom, fast lens, and small enough to carry anywhere. It is, simply put, the best all-around camera I have seen. For many, it will likely be the last camera they ever need to buy. Family shots, vacations, travel, HD video...it seems to meet 95% of my needs and I suspect it will yours. Most importantly, the quality of the pictures is truly top notch.As so many have said, the best camera is the one that you have with you. For me, I travel a little bit and hate taking my Nikon gear on a plane. Plus, it simply is not feasible to take it everywhere I go. Still, I want to be able to get great photos at any given moment. A family gathering, a trip, whatever. For those kinds of moments, I need a top quality performer and (sorry X100) the 4X zoom can certainly be handy. The X10 is a winner and worth every penny of its purchase price when looking at what you get.If you're looking for that one camera that will do it all for you and small enough to take everywhere, or a secondary camera to that big Nikon or Canon that you can't always take along.......this may well be THE ONE.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm Converted This Long-Time Canon Devotee [Updated]", "Author": "D. Warnecke", "ReviewID": "RJGWPENNK4W7H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Two years ago, I upgraded from a Canon SD1000 to a Canon S90.  The image quality was fantastic with great high ISO performance and sharp images, even wide-open in the corners.  Other aspects of the camera bothered me though.  It didn't feel expensive - the front control ring was loose and felt cheap when I used it to change aperture, the flash frequently jammed even when I'd never pushed it down or interfered with its motorized action, the buttons felt cheap, the LCD developed stuck pixels quickly and had an uneven backlight.  This year, I felt I needed something new.  Thanks to the popularity of the S90, even on the used market, I was able to recover about half what I paid for it new.Enter the Fujifilm X10.BUILD QUALITY & SIZE:The best build quality I've seen in a compact, ever.  Speaking as someone who cares perhaps a bit too much about aesthetics, I'm in heaven.  Magnesium and aluminum everywhere.  The dials are tight and the zoom ring has a lovely heavy, fluid action.  It's simply a joy to use.  It destroys the PowerShot S90.  The viewfinder is bright and big for a compact but it's total lack of shooting information makes using it more of a novelty under all but the most predictable conditions.  Size-wise, the X10 is a bit smaller than expected.  Holding it was initially awkward with the neck strap lug attachment in the way of my right hand but I'm beginning to adjust to it.  More than anything, I'll miss the pocketability of the S90.  Even with its case I could slip it into my jeans pocket.  The X10, with it's protruding lens, will never fit in any of my pockets.  I'm awaiting the Fujifilm LC-X10 case to come down in price to sane levels before picking one up.IMAGE QUALITY:The first thing that struck me about the X10's images was the color.  Compared to the S90 and other compacts I've used, the colors are more realistic, more lifelike, less harsh and digital.  They resemble my Canon 30D DSLR's images more than anything.  Fujifilm cameras have long been known for their lifelike color reproduction and the X10 has it in full force.Dynamic range, even without using the EXR \"DR\" sensor-split expansion mode, is very good.  Using DR400 at 6 MP gives it almost an HDR quality, but more realistic.  Highlights are generally well-controlled although a phenomenon can occur at low ISOs with bright highlights like chrome: circular, hard-edged white orbs.  I've seen these on a handful of shots and once you see them, you can't \"unsee\" them.  I really hope Fujifilm can fix this with a firmware update.  My S90 never had this issue, in fact, I loved using it to take 15 second night shots at ISO 80.  Fujifilm has to address this.  In my opinion, its the biggest flaw of the camera.High ISOs are very good.  Things fell apart for my S90 above ISO 800.  The X10 holds strong up to and including ISO 3200.  More detail is retained and noise is finely-grained, not the jaundiced yellow blotches the S90 produced at ISO 1600 and 3200.  I'd like to use RAW but Adobe needs to update ACR to recognize X10 RAW files first.Resolution is good but not appreciably better than the 10MP S90, particularly at low ISOs.  The lens seems to be sharp in the corners, even wide open.  There is some barrel distortion at 28mm but nothing too bad.  The f/2-f/2.8 lens allows for much more depth-of-field control than what was possible with the S90.  Will it replace my 30D and 60mm f/2.8 lens for portraits?  Not quite, but it's darned good for a compact.My favorite \"special feature\" is the 360\u00b0 Panorama mode.  It works surprisingly well.  The only caveat is the vertical resolution is an unimpressive 1080 pixels.Speaking of 1080 - the 1080p, 30 FPS video is pretty good.  Autofocus and zooming are present and accounted for, unlike the S90.  There is some of the dreaded CMOS \"jellyvision\" going on but only in certain circumstances.WRAP-UP:I'm sure you can tell that I really like this camera.  Canon lost me with the S100, which I was eagerly waiting for - too much of a priority on compactness and lens range at the expense of control and image quality.  Fujifilm built the X10 for photographers and its evident in how it looks, feels and operates.  One thing to think about is this:  Unlike Canon, Fujifilm doesn't have a low-end DSLR market to compete against.  They went all-out with the X10 since that price bracket is totally empty for them.  If you don't mind the relative bulk or price and you value a real \"photographer's camera\", the X10 is for you.***UPDATE***I tried to work around the \"white dot\" issue for months now.  Even after the firmware update that was promised to reduce the phenomenon, the issue remains and is as bad as it ever was.  It was very unethical for Fujifilm to roll out this update knowing it wouldn't resolve the issue, allowing the return window to expire as mine did.  Now I'm forced to unload this camera used at a loss.  Fujifilm will never have my business again.***UPDATE***In the end, Fujifilm pulled through and did the right thing.  I sent my X10 to the New Jersey service center and received a brand new replacement, entirely devoid of the \"white dot\" phenomenon.  This leaves me with an incredible compact that eventually led me to replacing my Canon DSLR with a Fujifilm X-Pro1.  While some of Fujifilm's products can be a little rough around the edges, it is clear that the company has a strong collective passion for innovation in the field of photography and especially sensor design.

It takes pictures that are sharply in focus and have great color. The lens focuses sharply outdoors and more importantly, indoors in incandescent and in lowlight.The Fuji X-10 has taken beautiful pictures of my young grandchildren, my two dogs and of the many flowers that I planted in our landscaped yard.

I was so pleased with my beautiful pictures of the bride walking down the aisle and of the couple exchanging their vows. My pictures were comparable to the professional photographer's taken with a Canon camera.  I took a stunning picture of a snow covered tree in my backyard at night with only the patio light on.

My last point-and-shoot for family vacations and daily walkaround is the venerable Lumix LX3 - pretty good high ISO performance, fast f/2.0 lens, 24mm wide.Why another P&S; ? (The wife asked too.)Primarily because the LX3's 60mm wasn't long enough for those times you want to shoot an architectural detail from the street or isolating a subject. But also because I wanted a less obstrusive, lightweight camera for street shooting with OVF operation and small lenses (I cannot afford the M9). My first unit towards this goal was the Fuji X100 but I promptly resold it after a week simply because:a) it didn't have image stabilization and my less-than-steady-hands are showing on my low-light images,b) for the price, I think it should have an option for a telephoto lens even if it were just for 5% of my shots,c) the 35/2 lens doesn't focus as close as my Nikon 35/2 unless you switch to macro mode which interrupts my flow,d) its price-vs-value-vs-features was neither here nor thereFortunately, Fuji announced the X10 not too long after. At half the price, a 28-112 fast zoom, image stabilization, manual zoom control, and a OVF - it sounded like we have a winner.Here's my initial feedback after a week with the X10 with the LX3 as reference:Pros- as small as most mirrorless designs although it is not back-pocketable (the Canon S100 and some Sony's are)- I love the manual zoom, but may appeal only to DSLR users (my favourite zooms are the 16-35 and the 70-200)- shooting through a viewfinder is a more natural way for me to shoot than via an LCD that I have to hold 12\" away from me (I'm 40)- noiseless stealth operation, unless you turn on the shutter sound feature- fast focusing- EXR function with increased DR mode works great- fill flash for portraits works great up to 20 feetCons- I wish it was a 24mm wide, but the panorama mode made up for it- the OVF needs adjusting to as it covers only 85% of the actual frame- the OVF has zero display and it would have been great even if they just added the focus box with focus lock indicator as I don't know where I'm focusing on most of the time- the menu system is counter intuitive and I kept having to look for the Metering option (spot, average, matrix)- battery life is really, really short - whereas I can get away with 2 batteries with the LX3 for a normal day of shooting, I probably have to have 3 batteries with the X10- the combi/spin wheel feels loose when turning and does not provide the right tactile feedbackThese are my initial feedback on the ergonomics and I will update my review once I fill up my 16Gb card. What I will continue to test is shooting street scenes using a quick-draw-and-quick-hide approach using the OVF. I don't expect it to be as responsive as I would use a DLSR - draw, focus, lock, shoot, tuck away - but I hope to go as close as I can.If it doesn't work out, we have another option in as far as my quest for a mirrorless camera with fast, small lenses - the forthcoming Fuji LX.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera - best point and shoot in the market (for now)", "Author": "A. Chiu", "ReviewID": "R339WXAI2X96Z5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "IMO, the X10 is the best point and shoot in the market right now. It has shortcomings and it's not the perfect point and shoot. But is there such a thing as a \"perfect\" camera? No. After all, the perfect camera is perfect only to one person -- the user. If you are considering the X10, keep in mind that the X10 is just a point and shoot. Don't expect or hope for big sensor quality images, or else, you will be disappointed. Even though the X10's sensor is slightly larger than the typical point and shoot, it's still much smaller than an APS-C sensor (in most DSLR's and some mirrorless cameras) and the 4/3 sensor in the Olympus and Panasonic mirrorless cameras.IMAGE QUALITY - Very good. It's better than my other point and shoot, the Canon S90. Also better than the XZ-1 (used it for two weeks). Out of camera JPGs provide good color and constrast. Images are sharp. Noise reduction is not over the top. I have yet to use RAW, because it wasn't until this past week that Lightroom got updated to handle RAW files from the X10. Even though I'm a RAW user, I have been very happy with the JPGs from the X10, just like I've been happy with the JPGs from the Fuji X100.SPECIAL MODES - When using the EXR special mode, resolution is cut in half from 12 mp to 6 mp, unless it's the EXR-HR (high resolution) mode, which is more or less no EXR at all. The other two EXR modes are DR (dynamic range) and NR (noise reduction). While using the DR and NR mode, there is a noticeable improvement in either dynamic range or noise reduction. The various modes that the X10 has can be confusing and overwhelming. But spend some time playing with the various modes and settings, and you will be rewarded.The X10 also has a mode called Pro Low Light, which takes four photos at high speed (and high ISO) and combines them into one to reduce noise. Images using this mode look even better than the EXR-NR mode. However, this is suitable only for static subjects. There's also a Pro Focus mode which artifically creates a bokeh, or the out of focus blurr on the background behind the main subject of the photo. Another mode that I like is the sweep panorama. Like the Pro Low Light mode, it's a copy cat of the similar modes in some of the Sony cameras, including the NEX. But I found the sweep panorama on the X10 much easier to use than the one on my NEX3.ERGONOMICS AND BUILD QUALITY - I like dials and buttons. And the X10 has plenty of them. Unfortunately, only one button is customizable. Buttons and dials are all the right places, and I can reach them with ease. This is not a one handed operational camera. Unlike all other point and shoots that I've ever encountered, zooming/unzooming is performed manually via the barrel of the lens with the left hand. So you will need two hands to operate the camera. The X10 could use a slightly bigger grip as well. But it's grippy enough for me. The build quality is awesome. The camera feels tight and solid. Whether it wears out over time or not, that remains to be seen.VIEWFINDER/LCD - The optical viewfinder is good enough for usage when bright conditions make it hard to use the LCD, which is rare where I live (Texas). It provides 85% coverage of what you are really taking a photo of, and the missing 15% is towards the bottom. So if you want to center the photo while using the viewfinder, aim a little bit lower. The viewfinder is bright, but does not provide any shooting information. So if you need focus confirmation, make sure you leave the \"beep\" turned on. Alternatively, you should be able to see the green light just to the right of the viewfinder. The LCD is average. It's not as good as the LCD on Sony cameras. But it's not as bad as the LCD on old Olympus and Canon cameras. It's bright enough, and has good contrast.USER INTERFACE - The menus is quirky. But once I figured out where things are, it's not too hard to get around. The user manual is crappy. But again, use common sense and dedicate sometime playing with the camera, and you will surely be rewarded.PERFORMANCE - Auto focus is snappy and faster than the S90 and the XZ1. No noticeable shutter lag. Shutter is silent, but you can have a fake shutter clicking noise if you want. The X10 even has three fake shutter clicking sounds to choose from. Auto focus can be off sometimes (rarely for me), but primarily in macro range. Speaking of macro, you can get as close as 1 centimeter for some real close up macro. Face detection seems unsure of itself, and the subject really has to be facing the camera for a good lock. Otherwise, the camera defaults to whatever AF setting you had it on (user chosen focus point, or multi-point). Auto focus in low light slows down, but it still locks on pretty good most of the time (especially if you turn the focus assist lamp on).WHITE DISC ISSUE - As some others have pointed out, the X10 photos will show white discs in situation where there is a strong light source. I've only encountered this situation once. Here's a link to the one photo that I have with the white discs. [...] I have taken about 1000 photos so far with the X10, and the white disc(s) hasn't appeared on any other photos as far as I could tell. On this particular photo, I only noticed the white discs after I went looking for them (subsequent to reading complaints about them).CONCLUSION - I like the X10 in spite of its short comings. The image quality is excellent for a point and shoot. Don't expect miracles from its small sensor. But as far as point and shoots are concerned, I really like this camera.Here's a thread that I started in a forum discussing the \"special\" modes that the X10 has. The thread includes photos that are good representatives of these \"special\" modes and the X10's capabilities.[...]", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Almost great", "Author": "JB123", "ReviewID": "R3S9UGOE67DXSH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was truly excited about this camera.  Everything about the X10 from ergonomics to specs sounded like someone had finally made a camera just for me.  Taking it out of the box I was immediately impressed with the heft and solid feel.  Then I turn it on and things went down hill from there.What the X10 is not:  a rangefinder.  The X10 is purely a point and shoot operation.  I hoped for more manual control.  The X10 is just not designed that way.  Manual focus mode on the X10 is insultingly useless.  Shooting in aperture priority mode should be easy but the LCD screen is useless in bright sun and that is the only way to access the aperture and shutter settings.ISO:  specs sound great.  \"ISO 100- 12800\"  But the highest sensitivities are only available when shooting small JPEGs.  No raw above ISO 3200.Mechanics:  the zoom / power control ring on the lens sounded like a good idea.  But reality is mine had a very sticky spot at the 50mm mark and the actual \"on\" position is ambiguous.  No weather sealing on a $600 point and shoot?  80% humidity limit!  I would have happily paid $700 if it was weather sealed.Lens:  optics are great.  But the front element is very exposed without the impossible to obtain hood / filter adapter.  While compact in the off position, with the lens extended the front will get hit on something eventually.Viewfinder:  optical viewfinder is an absolute necessity for me.  That was 90% of why I bought the X10.  But it is too quickly blocked by the extending lens and of too limited coverage.  Having only LED indicators on the outside next to the viewfinder makes the viewfinder itself really only useful as a sighting tool in daylight (which is good as the LCD is unreadable in sun).  Just having basic exposure and focus confirmation in the viewfinder would have made this 10X more useful.I returned the X10.  Perhaps a version or two in the future Fuji will have refined this design into what I need.  But this is not it.  For now i wil continue relying on my DSLRs for \"real\" camera functions and a trusty Canon A590 point-n-shoot for a pocket camera.  The A590 does everything the X10 does and it cost me $100.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "WARNING!", "Author": "BGB", "ReviewID": "R3QSKAFY8A4GPX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While this is a fantastic little camera - especially for Amazon's reduced price - you should know that they are still shipping 15+ month old models with the faulty (re: White Orbs) sensor.  I received mine today as a birthday gift.  The SN was prefixed 14A, the firmware was 1.02, and the sensor was the original faulty unit.  Fuji recognized this sensor problem and started shipping models with the new sensor in May or 2012.  While I ordinarily love Amazon, I cannot fathom why they're shipping old models with the faulty sensor 16 month later.The firmware update to 2.0 fixes, slightly, the white orb problem.  This issue aside, the camera is a fantastic buy for anyone wanting something pocketable (jacket, not jeans) with manual controls.QUICK UPDATE:Amazon is replacing this order with a new one and allowing me to keep the current camera until the new one arrives (next day shipping).  Great customer service, as always!  Hopefully, the new order will be a new model.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing for its size", "Author": "Busy Executive", "ReviewID": "R38PPS3LI6ZDW6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those times when I don't want to carry my DSLR and all those heavy lenses, I always like to have a compact quality camera that I can grab with a moment's notice - and the Fuji X10 is my new favorite.For one thing, it's rugged and doesn't feel like a toy. It feels like a camera in your hands - a tool to take great pictures with, not something that you might confuse with your iPod. The controls are logical and well-placed, and the stuff you use a lot - lens controls, exposure, etc - are all easy to use without really thinking about it. Like all great cameras, it doesn't get in the way of making great photographs.I've never used Fuji cameras before, and it took me a while to get used to the cameras menus and user interface. Yes, everything you want is there - I've just been spoiled over the years because I use mostly Nikon equipment, and there's a sense of familiarity from the smallest subcompacts to the mighty DSLRs. Still, the menus and controls all seem well conceived and although there's a lot of settings in there, the camera isn't at all difficult to use.Image quality is the best I've seen from a camera this size. I tend to shoot RAW, and pictures taken in bright light at medium focal lengths aren't all that different than what I get from my Nikon D3. To my eye, JPEGs are also quite good...certainly good enough for online use and for prints up to about 8x10. I find images to be slightly warm and perhaps a bit over-saturated, with wonderful skin tones for portraits, although the built-in flash is a bit cool by comparison. In low light, the X10 does better than any compact cameras I've used, although here's where the size advantage of my DSLR helps...the X10 is good up to about ISO 800 - above that the DSLR is coming out.The X10 also has a few special modes that improve dynamic range (think HDR) or help you take wide panoramas by stitching multiple shots together. If you're accustomed to film, the X10 even has emulation modes for most of the Fuji classic films...Velvia, Provia, etc. While some of these are unique to Fuji, I tend to do this sort of thing afterwards in the computer, so most of these features aren't that important to me.The high-quality lens takes filters, hoods and other accessories and is quite sharp and contrasty edge-to-edge, even wide open. For close-ups, it focuses down to about half an inch. Bokeh or out of focus areas are pleasant without a lot of the harshness you sometimes see in small cameras. Indeed, I find myself shooting in Aperture Priority mode quite a bit so that I can use the f/2 end of the lens for nice out-of-focus backgrounds.There's an accessory hot-shoe on top for use with outboard flash. While the built-in flash is reasonably powerful and useful for daylight fill-flash, it's really too close to the lens axis, so you get the dreaded red-eye on nearly every shot. An outboard flash unit is the answer, since it sits further from the lens and minimizes any chance of red-eye. I tried it with my pro Quantum flash (which is several times bigger than the camera itself!) and got very good results. Unfortunately, there's not an off-camera flash system built in, similar to Nikon's Creative Lighting System (CLS). You can use various types of radio triggers or slave units to get this result, but it would have been great to have something built-in.The X10 includes all the other goodies you expect from a serious camera these days, from image stabilization and an optical viewfinder to auto-bracketing and the ability to program various shooting parameters for quick reuse. Underneath the camera is a solid tripod mount, and there's a direct HDMI output so you can connect the camera to a TV or monitor. It's fast starting up and to autofocus, and shutter lag is really excellent for a camera in this league. It will do 7 frames a second in burst mode, and the X10 can also take 1080p video, although to be honest, I have camcorders for video, so other than to verify that it works properly, I haven't done much with video yet.I do have a few minor complaints. For one, unlike the X10's big brother (the X100), there's no built-in GPS. I've grown accustomed to having my photos automatically geotagged, but this isn't possible with the X10. The other thing is battery life, which tends to be only about 200-300 shots per charge (depending on how much you use the flash).Overall, the X10 does everything I expect in a camera and takes photographs I'm proud of. It's not always the tool of choice, but for a majority of day-to-day shots, it's a wonderful performer, and for the price, it can't be beat. Fuji definitely has a winner here.Definitely recommended!", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Shortcomings missing from most reviews", "Author": "Neimo", "ReviewID": "R2BSXNHFQC6KI4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There are many comprehensive reviews already available. These are some of the shortcomings most don't mention. The X10 is like how most cars twenty years ago had confusing or downright bad controls for the radio, heating and air conditioning. Even when people figured out the basics, they weren't as easy to use as modern ones, and controls for advanced features were either missing or not user friendly at all.Please note I'm keeping my X10 and like it for many reasons, but my Canon SD870 from three years ago doesn't have these issues yet cost half as much. Details like these keep this good camera from being great.1. On the bottom of the display is a thick gray semi-transparent bar that cannot be turned off, but all the other elements like ISO, histogram, and shutter speed can. It is so dark it interferes with composing shots in 4:3 or 1:1 aspect ratios. It should be removable or the transparency adjustable.2. Image Stabilization at max zoom needs about 1/15th of a second to get a sharp shot. A Canon point and shoot from three years ago can get usably clear shots down to 1/8th about a third of the time. The X10 at 1/8th consistently produces smeared shots. Steadier hands than mine will likely do better.3. The Custom display view is unavailable in EXR Auto. Custom is the only view where framing aids like the histogram, grid lines, and electronic level are available. So if you want help composing or having a flat horizon, you'll have to pick another mode. X10 users often recommend turning the dial to EXR and leaving it. Within EXR are four choices; Auto, High Resolution, Low Light, and Dynamic Range. Auto is super simple because the X10 picks which of those three is appropriate. Yet that's where Custom view is missing. To get it back means manually switching between them. On a partly cloudy day with the sun coming and going that means a lot of switching to use the optimal choice. Also indoors where the light varies from strong enough in one corner to dimly lit across the room. That situation means always paying attention to switching back and forth between High Resolution and Low Light.4. 30 second exposures are only available at ISO 100. At ISO 400 it's 8 seconds. At 800 it's 4 seconds and at 1600 it's 2. The camera I'm replacing does 15 seconds at any ISO. I was looking forward to taking high ISO shots for twenty or thirty seconds on moonlit nights but that is not possible. (If you are going to take a long exposure, all the ISO and shutter combinations let in the same limited amount of light, but as usual ISO 100 has significantly less noise, better detail and color.)5. With ISO Bracketing the camera takes three shots with identical shutter and aperture. Only the ISO changes between the three so the brightness varies. What would be more helpful in low light is keeping the aperture fixed and adjust the shutter speed to compensate for the ISO. The three shots would have the same brightness with three opportunities to get a sharp, not blurry photo. Then keep the sharpest one that has the most detail and hopefully low ISO.6. After taking a photo it can be reviewed for 1.5 or 3 seconds. Or it will hold for 1.5 seconds then zoom all the way in to allow for checking the focus. It would help if pressing the Zoom Out button prevents the zoom in so users can first look at the overall image. There should also be a way to freeze the review image for longer than 3 seconds until half-pressing the shutter or Back button. While the Playback button does this it causes the screen to blink black for a quarter second which is distracting. It's one of those details other cameras handle seamlessly and make their experience smoother.7. In review/Playback mode, portrait-oriented photos don't automatically rotate to fill the screen when holding the camera vertically so the image can match the screen. The pictures are displayed small and narrow in the middle of the screen with black vertical bars. Worse, when zooming in the black bars remain. That's right. As it zooms it doesn't use the whole screen, only the middle strip that a 4:3 portrait takes up. So a 16:9 or 3:2 image starts narrower and will zoom in to fill the space of a 4:3 but no further. There is a menu setting to playback portrait shots rotated ninety degrees but then they always are like that and require turning the camera vertically for them.8a. Deleting photos requires three button presses versus two for a Canon. 1 - Delete, 2 - press Up to select OK instead of the default Cancel, 3 - OK. There should be a setting for OK to be the default so the two presses are Delete and OK. Deleting would go 50% faster.8b. To delete multiple photos, each one must be tediously selected. There is no way to select only the first and last in a range of them such as 0022 through 0086 and then delete the range. To quickly make space and delete all photos taken on a certain date requires searching for them first.9. Fujifilm's included software doesn't import photos with the folder date of when they were taken and doesn't preserve the date and time of when they were shot in the filename.10. The included software doesn't auto rotate images to match orientation. That means selecting all the vertical images by hand to rotate them.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "replaced my G10...Waaaahh.....LOVE it.", "Author": "J. M Ullman \"chimayred\"", "ReviewID": "R3LP6MH3W5R19M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first saw this a year ago I was hooked but backed off based on the \"white orb\" artifacts and decided to stick with My G10, my Olympus EpL1, and then bit the bullet and bought an Olympus OM-D, EM-5, which frankly has blown away every other camera I've ever owned (including 5 fujis - f30, F40fd, F200 EXR, E550, Lumix Z28, Canon G10 and  Nikon D40).  But that's another review.When I saw the new X20, esp. with the chrome version, I was blown away again and especially loved the new features.  But it was $600....as I was researching I found that X10 prices for used were in the $300 range, and I managed to find a factory fresh one with the new sensor from a US authorized dealer for $397.  So I jumped.  It has the new sensor; ive shot perhaps 100 pics, mostly at night...and they are beautiful.  It didn't come with the new firmware (2.0) which frankly was a snap to install...v 20 gives creative filters which I like, like color accent, dramatic tone, and the Raw button now gives you a super panel.  I don't shoot raw.It's a gorgeous ergonomic camera.  Very small...smaller than my Iphone...although deeper. Smaller than my other 3.  You can read all about its quirks - like turning it on with the lens - online.  That is mixed...i shoot a lot of stuff one handed while driving or in the cold, so it requires 2 hands but it is very tactile and a better idea than tiny little on-off buttons you can't operate with gloves.It has almost everything I want.  Good zoom range, programmable button (I use it for 2X zoom), WB balance button, excellent, I mean excellent flash, 2 programmable/custom settings, low light EXR setting, which I think is fine although it goes to 6mp.  I especially like the exposure control dial and the optical viewfinder.  I don't know why people bitch about this....it's really handy for tough lighting situations, you can use it instead of the LCD to save power - I mean so what that it doesn't cover 100% of the picture?  Crop it.  Exposure lock buttons, self timer, motor drive, seamless pan for panorama - which is REAlLY nice...plenty of info in the LCD, i like the levelling bar, menus are very easy and logical...pro focus and pro low light...loads of scene modes as you would expect, Ive always like the \"natural and flash\" setting which gives you natural light and a flash to choose from with one click, macro and super macro...OK, OM-D has it beat but hell, it is $1100....i also like the fact that this camera has a manually operated zoom which saves on battery power and gives more control.  Good responsive video.  Don't know if it has a multiple exposure setting....not a big deal.  I've shot about 4000 pics on my OM-D, and shot 1 multiple exposure.  Has loads of other bells and whistles.Now, of all my cameras, one thing is certain.  I have never taken more riveting  photos than on a trip to Croatia in 2008.  the colors and the sharpness were breath taking.  And those were with a 6mp Fuji F 30.  Sorry world.  So I am really excited about the possibilities with this.  And it is  beautiful.  Yes, looks like an old Rangefinder.  Not a single issue with blooming artifact.  Colors...well, Fuji I guess because of the film history - the colors are rich.  Fuji should be a lot higher on the list....send me an email if you have questions. And oh...I have NO idea what all the fuss is about putting a filter on?  I bought the Marumi 40mm UV filter which you can find on Ebay for $18 and it screws on the front of the lens like any other high end camera I have ever owned....Update:  so i have had this for several months and thought i would up date it.Well, the picture quality is stunning.  Only camera I have owned that is better or equal is my OM-d EM-5  If I had to take one camera on a trip it would be the Olympus because it is just more versatile, i have a huge zoom on it, the customizability is great.  But I just took this X10 as m only camera to New Orleans and it was remarkable.  A little harder to customize; a little less versatile than the Olympus for night shooting, but the flash is great, the low light performance is terrific.  The filters and scenes are very useful; the pan for panorama blows the Oly away with superb quality and ease of use.  Colors are gorgeous.  Wish list?  Maybe the ability to switch filters with a few fewer clicks.  slightly better and quicker manual focus.  But I have taken nearly 1000 pictures with this and if it was my only camera it would be damn near perfect.  Perfect size, reallly cool looking, viewfinder is just fine.  Yeah, would I like a display in it?  Then spring for the X20.  Remember, I got this for less than $400.  If I wanted to spend $600 I'd spring for the X20.  This is a nearly ideal camera in a perfect size package.  Fits in a coat or large pant pocket.  Love it.  Oh yeah.  And not a white orb in sight and I shoot at least half my stuff at night.UPDATE:  So nearly a year later I just went on a 7 day trip to Oktoberfest and Czech Republic.  In August I went to Yellowstone for a week and I took it but mostly used my OM-D EM-5.  But I noticed that the Fuji pics were as good.  And on this last trip i wanted as little bulk as possible.  So I took the Fuji.Took 1000 pics.  So first the \"downside\", and I'm comparing to an OM-D Em-5, D 40, G 10.  The manual focus button on the front of the body gets flicked on accidentally in my waist pack and I'll find I'm shooting a handful of images with manual focus.  Second, it's harder to customize art filters with this than the OMD. That's it.Picture quality is great.  In camera pan-to panorama images are terrific.  Colors are remarkable.  I don't miss a longer zoom.  Low light performance amazing.  Took lots of handheld pics at night on auto, took pictures of Prague Castle setting camera on a railing, lots of indoor pics, museum pics; many pics in museums that didn't allow photos....just turn off sound, and do a side shot, rest camera on my shoulder pac.  I'm sorry.  The quality of these pictures is just flabbergasting.  I see these guys lugging these massive SLr's and really, I'm wondering why. Other downsides?  A little barrel distortion when shooting up at rectangular buildings.  Viewfinder orientation is slightly off, but I don't use it unless it is bright sunlight.

Here's what I like about it:Much smaller and lighter than an SLR with zoom lens.It's simplicity itself to turn on: just twist the zoom lens. Powers up instantly and focuses quickly.Fast lens: f2.0 at wide angle, 2.8 at telephoto.Manual zoom--much quicker, easier than an electric zoom, easier to make precise adjustments.The viewfinder! Like a real camera. Essential for my style of picture taking. I'm 69 and grew up on film SLR's and rangefinders. If you are accustomed to those kinds of cameras, you will feel comfortable with the X10's construction.Wide variety of shooting modes, many of which I can actually understand. I especially like the auto-bracketing, which I use a lot in difficult lighting situations when I have to take a picture quickly.Takes super pictures nearly all the time. Sharp, great detail and contrast, great color. Decent in low light.Here's what I don't like:Larger and heavier than a point and shoot. Not pocketable, except maybe in a jacket pocket. Seems too small for a shoulder strap. I use a wrist strap to keep it from falling in case I lose my grip.The viewfinder shows only 85% of the actual picture and displays no shooting information at all--not focus, exposure or anything. The lens obscures the bottom right corner at short focal lengths.There's a definite learning curve for the many exposure modes and functions, and the instruction book is just a book of hints. You must either spend hours on the forums or buy a supplementary book.Autofocus isn't always perfect. Manual focus possible, but slow and cumbersome. I almost never use it.Front lens element is close to the front metal ring of the lens, which means unless you're very careful you have to keep the lens cap on all the time when not shooting to prevent fingerprints, scratches, etc.The notorious \"white orbs\" problem (specular highlights will sometimes appear as white blobs in pictures). I returned my camera to Fuji for a fix, but the problem still exists, though to a lesser extent than before.My conclusion? When I'm going out mainly to take photos and don't mind shlepping a big kit, the SLR is easier to use and takes better pictures. When I just want to have a camera with me and don't expect to do any serious photography, I slip the point-and-shoot into my pocket. But the X10 is my travel camera. It's small enough to be portable and is much lighter than an SLR with a zoom lens. It's much more camera than a point-and-shoot, and takes pictures good enough to enlarge. It's great for fast, seat-of-the pants shooting, and you can expect quality results--a little like a Leica (which it's intended to resemble).Despite what the ads might boast, the camera hasn't yet been made that can do everything perfectly. I am not one who has either the inclination or the resources to buy a new camera every 6 months. My X10 goes with me on every major trip. Oh, by the way, it's fun to use.

I REALLY REALLY needed a smaller compact camera to complement my other big and heavy DSLRs.  I just want to say that this X10 i can take ANYWHERE.  This is THE perfect compact camera for me, and i can take it and hide it under my coat without anybody even noticing it is there.  Well, the camera is not tiny, but it sure feels like it, specially since it has that pretty wide range zoom lens.  This is why i chose it over the X-E1 and the X-M1 coming out soon.The built quality, design, performance, and image quality output are TOP NOTCH in this camera.  I really don't know what the X20 has for double the price, but this X10 has everything i need.  The low light performance is very very good indeed, considering it's small sensor size.  Actually i read in many forums that the noise output from the X10 is not so good because of its small sensor, but all i can say is that many of those statements are just not true, because i have confirmed that.  I have had many good ISO DSLRs and what i can say is that the ISO performance from the X10 can compete with some cameras with bigger sensors. Don't under estimate this little camera.  I shot many photos in low light (in jpeg) and this thing outputs photos with very little noise, straight out of the camera.  I am very impressed.  I didn't even had it set to high ISO Priority mode, and if i PP the noise in LightRoom they would look even better.  Pretty amazing indeed.  Last time i had a point and shoot camera was around 8 years ago, and this X10 is a HUGE improvement from what we had back then.I will say that this camera is not for a beginner.  If you are going to buy this type of camera, you should know at least how certain functions work, such as ISO, Shutter and Aperture. Those are some of the simple and basic thing someone should already know, otherwise many of your pictures will come out very blurry and bad. And definitely you will HAVE to read the manual.  This is a very high tech little camera.I shopped around for a long long time.  I looked at the famous Pentax MX-1 also, very very good camera also, but when i had the Pentax on my hand it just felt awkward and not normal.  The X10 fits like a little glove, and it has a shoe for external flash already, which i will be using.  The Fuji just has everything i wanted.  I am extremely happy with my new X10. For it's current $349 price, i think this is one of THE best compact cameras out there.The only thing i don't like is the very POOR battery life, but i read somewhere in flickr that Radio Shack sells a brand that lasts longer than this fuji battery that comes with the camera.  I shot around 100 photos and the battery gave up.  I did have the LCD on, since i am learning and playing with the camera a lot right now, but soon i will turn off the LCD and other recommended functions for longer batt life.I still feel like giving this camera 5 stars.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "UPDATE:  X10 not so great after warranty ends . . .", "Author": "dennisaitch", "ReviewID": "R3JHZAUIHUEKR6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Have had the X10 nearly four months now and with the latest firmware update am very happy with it - except for the battery charge indicator.  As others have noted, after the charge indicator drops one of the three segments it often shuts the camera down within a few minutes of use.  I had hopes this would be fixed with a firmware update but maybe that is not possible. Fuji?  Initially the camera felt deceptively secure in hand, until it slipped from my grip.  Fortunately I had the camera strap wrapped around my hand.  Have since purchased a wrist strap which I always use.  Also have the Marumi clear 40mm lens protector and have tethered the lens cap to the left strap attachment eyelet.  The X10 feels well made and is a delight to use.  Image quality is better than expected.  Auto focus is quick and accurate (except not so consistent when the battery charge is low).  Extra battery a must. Printed manual could be better.  To enjoy this camera read through the manual more than once.  The X10 is small and light enough that I always have it with me.  Would buy it again.UPDATE of review:  Less than 15 months after purchase, the camera no longer focuses in the middle of the zoom range.  Fuji customer service will repair - replacing the lens - for a fee.  I'm very disappointed since the camera has never been dropped, has always been carried in a protective bag.  Also, has become difficult to open the aperture to f/2.  F2.2 is the widest the lens typically opens to.  Two star experience with the X10. Would no longer recommend.

Use it as intended.Yes, it has lots of options and manual controls. Yes you will get the Orbs if you,shoot after 6pm. Yes, you have zillions of options about dynamic range, auto ISO, and a mode dial that might intimidate at first.This what I use it for and why I love it:Blurr free low light shots that will amaze you:I own several cameras, from m43rds to APSC Pentax K5. I can't get hassle free sharp low,light shots like i get with the X10. I have tried to take hundres of shots of my three year old, running around our living room. Before the X10, I bought quite a few \"bright\" lenses for my GH2 and K5. Forget about it. The X10 with its Pro Low Light mode, eats them for lunch.Sunsets and afterglow shots:Color rendition is great with the \"sunset\" mode. Just look at the X10 groups on Flickr.High dynamic content shots:Use it on XDR mode and discover foolproof blue skies and strong intense lights tamed. You can shoot inside a tunnel and in EXR mode, the camera will balance the light at the end. There is a very useful exp. compensation dial next to your thumb for when it doesn't.Portrait and natural light modes:I have taken extremely beautiful shots of my daughter with this camera. It's perfect for kids. It's fast too, provided you use the single focus spot in the center. Just focus and recompose. Try the \"smooth portrait\" auto mode too. The shallow depth of field mode is cool too, with some subjects.In other words, use it like you would a point and shoot camera which it is. It doesnt pretend to be anything else and neither should you.Who cares that it looks like a Leica and its really well built. It's meant to be shot in auto mode and it does have awesome auto modes. Try them, explore them and see the results for yourself.Don't even try to use it manually and try to figure out how to shoot this camera with the optimal setup. The forum geeks at DPreview haven't figured out how to shoot this camera in PASM modes either (I tried all possible combinations myself, including raw). The Discussions over there usually end in attrition.I also own a Lumix LX3 and that camera also works best for me in auto mode, most of the time. I would not dream of using it manually and neither would you. It yields wonderful photos, althought a bit noisy. What makes you think the X10 should be treated differently?If you want good picture quality with no orbs (I am not that sensitive to them) get a DSLR. For $600 you can get a Canon (excuse me, I think I'm going to puke).If you want  a nice camera with fewer options and cheaper, get an iPhone.If you want the best picture quality in a smaller size, get a micro four thirds camera.If you want the best possible picture quality and no compromises, go ahead and spend two or three thousand dollars.Don't get this camera and expect to take it on your next trip to Amazonia. Dont take it on the space shuttle (oops too late), And don't even try to shoot cityscapes at night!Don't play the role of professional photographer fantasy. Don't even bother. Get a Leica instead.If I have to see one more whino complain about the orbs, etc...im jumping out the window. These people don't take pictures, most of them don't even own the X10 and others don't even leave their living rooms. They just take pictures of their Smurfs figurines. Then they return their cameras and look for justification. They probably live alone in a trailer and don't have kids.Ignore them.This is the hottest, most sensible purchase,  compact, extremely well built Point and shoot. Did I mention is a POINT and SHOOT?

It has excellent specs and produces amazing for a compact pics in some cases but in real life fast paced situations simply doesn't deliver.Of all the sites, on Dec 12, 2011 Pentaxforums just posted a very useful and OBJECTIVE hands on review of the x10 (comparing against the Pentax Q). A lot of pic samples and \"missing manual\" info. I concur and strongly recommend to check it before buying.Their conclusions read: \"When you first unpack the Fujifilm X10 it impresses you with its Leica looks, build quality and compact retro design with all buttons and dials placed just right. However, when you start using it thinking you can exercise control over shutter speed, aperture, and other shooting parameters, frustration sets in.There are simply too many confusing restrictions and inter-dependencies in aperture, shutter speed, sensitivity, dynamic range and noise control for the camera to be useable in anything but one of the fully automatic modes, shooting JPG only. The sensor also disappoints somewhat. It is not up to the level of resolution available from similarly-sized 12 MP sensors with the photo-sites arranged in the traditional Bayer pattern. The Fujifilm EXR sensor may have a better dynamic range and better noise suppression but it comes at the cost of resolution. In order to benefit from these advantages the resolution must be set to 6 MP or even 3 MP. However, if you mainly view your images on a monitor and don't make big-size enlargements, even 6 MP is more than adequate in for such use the image quality and color rendition is astounding.On the plus side, and it is a big plus, the X10 has a bright optical view finder which comes in handy in bright light where other compact cameras with nothing but the LCD monitor for image composing become utterly useless.The lens is of very high quality, it surpasses most other compact cameras including the Pentax Q 02 Zoom Lens by boasting a fast aperture of f/2 to f/2.8 and a very useful zoom range equivalent to 28-112mm in the old days. Distortion, aberrations and flare are also very well controlled.....If you usually shoot with a DSLR and are looking for a compact camera where you can exercise full manual control over exposure and focus just like with the DSLR you may want to look elsewhere. If you come from a traditional point-and-shoot or of you just want a compact companion to your DSLR primarily for use in auto mode, the Fujifilm X10 is a good choice. In the EXR Auto mode it takes care of the complex interrelated settings and in most cases picks the appropriate setting for the scene. The image quality is close to excellent and the drop in resolution to 6 MP in high contrast or low light scenes is not a factor when sharing the images on the web or making small er medium sized prints.\"My experience:POSITIVE-To save space not going to repeat all good you've read. Some of it in the legends for my sample pics.-Stunning \"Pro low-light\" mode (see the pic).-Good DR with some settings.NEGATIVE-Clunky slow GUI a la original NEX-3/5 and factory presets that make already steep learning curve much more painful. One has to read the manual and learn how to use such a complex machine but one shouldn't get bloody blisters from it. A very helpful suggestions for optimal performance by axlotl at DPRev-s  (Nov 19, 2011).-As of firmware v1.02 the X10 is user-unfriendly:-It does have a printed manual (+)that mainly lists the functions of the X10 w/o explaining clearly when and how (---).  Not much info on web yet. Recommend Kimletkeman use of EXR sensor is different from CCD and CMOS or look up reviews on lower models of EXR cameras - the rating distribution is almost identical for different models and for the same reason.-I am using mainly Pentax K-5 and a compact Lumix ZS7 (used 7D, D300s, D7000, D5100, Ricoh GXR, Canon S2 and a bunch of others), their menu layouts were similarly short and ergonomic. I didn't expect an evolved menu of higher end DSLR but a tiny-winy ZS7 leaves X10 in the dust. With the X10 one has to go through at least 2 extra layers to get where you want. The Menu button brings only 2 tabs (Shooting consisting of 4 pages and Settings consisting of 6 pages) (bottleneck #1) on the short vertical side of the screen. Most other cams have >>2 tabs on the top that provide faster access to the settings. Also, each tab opens only one page, no scrolling up and down, just move the cursor in the desired position or move it to the next tab, if you don't see what you need. The X10 could have 4 separate red tabs for 4 pages of the Shooting menu + 6 separate blue tabs for 6 pages of Setting menu. Instead, you have to scroll through the contents of the whole tab and, if it's not there, through the 2nd one up to 10 pages!!! (bottleneck #2).-Fonts are small-When you click the text box it doesn't increase in size. People wearing glasses, bear with me!-Turning the Mode dial brings up a screen with a big image of a half of the mode dial and huge Help balloon completely blocking the LCD! A short example: EXR on the dial - the stupid screen (I want to see on the LCD how new setting affects the image, not a useless reminder that I just moved the dial into EXR position. The Help balloon might be helpful for beginners but after a couple of times it turns into a huge annoyance) - Menu button - 4 options for EXR - Up-Down arrow to choose one - screen prompting to press the OK button but you can press the shutter right away at the expense of not seeing what you are shooting...(bottleneck #3).Now imagine how long it takes to chose between 16 available scene modes! I've read a lot of comments that pros are not using Scene Modes. This is just a good example, the whole menu structure is too complicated and slows down changes of practically any setting, if they are not sitting in the very beginning. In the ZS7 Scene mode brings a pictographic table of ~1/2 the scenes (the whole set takes 2 pages) with Scenes header on the same page and page numbers 1 and 2. All it takes is to put the cursor on the right symbol (using 4 way controller for scrolling as opposed to 2-way in the X10) and click to see the immediate effect on the image. Once again Fuji, 1 turn of the wheel, a couple of clicks on the arrows and 1 last OK click before seeing what you are the shooting or skip OK and just shoot. Do you feel a difference between $200 and $600 camera?-P-mode is disabled when the flash is ON (that is OUT) and even if an external flash is enabled in the menu w/o being physically attached...????????? Also flash cannot be controlled with the subdial in several modes-The rotating subdial wheel is very small and shallow (I pity people with mid-size and above hands. People planning to wear gloves should look elsewhere).-It is also very close both laterally and vertically to the 4-way controller, that when you finally manage to rotate the wheel, you also randomly engage some of the 4 \"buttons\".-In my copy these \"buttons\" are extremely sensitive to pressure. You never know which one out of the 4 sides you are pressing, menus keep jumping to an adjacent(Drive to Macro back and forth etc).-Not sure it it's because of battery saving mode but Displ. and subdial menus (except the Menu/OK button) disappear right in front of you, nave to press the button again and have my fingers ready.-Terrible factory presets, doesn't give good IQ out of the box search How to Shoot an EXR Camera.  The defaults tend to hike up ISO and lower shutter speed that leads to blown up highlights, strong noise and smeared by NR pics. Noise and smearing can be reduced with minimum loss of quality by reducing the file size setting from L to M. This reduces the number of pixels by 1/2, bringing down iso to 100  or 200 simultaneously increasing the DR and decreased NR blotching artefacts(see the pics and legends).-LCD needs to be stopped down for daylight -1 and upped for low light +2 to get an idea how the pic looks in print/computer screen.-After the first charge the battery went down fast but there are several $5 generics at Amazon.-Writing of Raw+jpeg on class 10 Patriot and Transcend SD card is a bit slow (had no problems with 16MP files from K-5, even in continuous mode on these not top notch but decent cards). You can neither use LiveView, nor shoot. Apparently it has a small buffer. Make sure you get a fast Sundisk for RAW shooting but not overpay for the card - the buffer is the weakest link.-My copy of the X10 came with the latest v1.02 installed. Nevertheless, it still show F2 as 2.2 in most modes. Not sure, they might have \"silent\" firmware updates and not all v1.02 are equal.-According to the Fuji website, firmware update require a special program for putting the file on SD card. With a dozen other cameras that I've used, one copies the file directly on SD card. Another hassle. Finally found fujixseriesdotyouknowwhat stating that it is optional for X100. I presume the X10 and X100 \"mentality\"...Things that could be better:-Hopefully menu ergonomics and larger fonts and icons will be addressed in future firmware.-No histogram overlay with full size image, only with small one (~1/4) in full info screen. Hopefully will be addressed in future firmware.-The optical viewfinder feels \"empty\" compared to \"plasma TV-like\" of X100 but has the job done. Optional more powerful and compact folding-flat bounce flash EF-20 is available for 130.-On/off switch on the lens is a mixed blessing. Looks very cool at first but coming from DSLRs I can normally put a camera in shooting read state faster by simultaneously moving zoom to the desired range with one hand and flipping the ON switch with another, often while taking out of a bag. One handed handling of the X10 is slower than 2 handed. A separate switch would have also allowed to leave the zoom at the desired focal setting or in the middle, cutting down the final zooming time to one click of ON button and m.b. some final fine zooming.Unexplainable:-Odd lens thread size??? 39.5 or 40.3mm, there is no consensus between Fuji reps...-Overpriced Fuji adapter LH-X10 (100 a pop). Hopefully will be addressed by affordable 3rd party adaptersFrom the web: People were able to use older 40mm (not more common 40.5mm) filters, hoods and step up rings w/o any problems. BUT not all old 40mm lens threads are created equal and the old stocks have been sold out. Presumably new Marumi DHG Lens Protect filter and Marumi Lens Protect 40mm  filters (not available in the USA) fit as well as some Kenko's 40mm. If you got lucky with some 40.5mm filters, hoods and adapters or find a source of 40mm threaded, please post here the brand and exact cat. #-On a positive note, there is a dirt cheap leather case (LC-X10) for only 130...

S&W; Photo Accessory co 40mm-49mm step-up ring from Heavystar ($9) is well crafted, perfectly fits into the lens thread and is not blocking the OVF or causing vignetting at any focal lengths. My favorite for FA 35mm f/2 straight metal 20mm hood with 49mm thread causes vignetting at focal lengths <36mm (looks great though...). Smth around 15mm high should work. $5 49mm Promaster petal hood looks horrible but works at focal lengths.

Buzby", "ReviewID": "R349DDZCKHTI1M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I consider myself an amateur photographer. I am not a camera geek but just like to take good pictures under a variety of conditions with minimal fuss. My ideal camera is one that I can \"set and forget\" if I want to, or adjust the settings easily when I feel like it.  I don't like changing lenses or lugging around a DSLR if I don't have to.I bought this camera a few weeks ago and am very pleased so far.  When I want point and shoot simplicity, I put it in the \"EXR\" mode and it gives excellent results in nearly any lighting situation.  Yes it changes resolution to 6MP when it selects the low light or dynamic range modes, but the results are great.  I personally don't print a lot of enlargements or do major cropping.I rarely need to use the flash with this camera, which is a major plus since I like natural lighting much better.  The fast lens and EXR mode usually make it unnecessary to use flash indoors to get great results.  The auto ISO mode seems to choose the appropriate ISO level to prevent camera shake.  I love that I choose when to turn the flash on using the manual switch; the camera does not pop up the flash automatically when it \"thinks\" I need it.  I only use the flash either in very dark situations or when there is severe backlighting.Camera auto focus and drive mode are very good, fast enough to take action shots of my kids playing.  I consider this a key benefit over other cameras in the same class, because it acts much more like a DSLR than a point and shoot when I want it to.Manual zoom lens is also great.  It gives much more control than the \"thumb and forefinger\" method of holding the camera on most current point and shoots.Unlike some other reviewers I think the optical viewfinder is excellent. I normally use the LCD screen to compose shots, but in bright sunlight or when I am taking action shots I just put it up to my eye and click away.  I don't care that there is no exposure or focus confirmation in the viewfinder. I just keep my subject in the frame and the camera does the rest.I have not seen the \"white blob\" issue that some others comment on.  Fuji is apparently working on a firmware fix for this so its nice to see they are responsive to issues.Overall this is a great camera and I have no regrets.  I took away one star due to the weak user manual and apparently random ability to use different options in the different modes. For example, I can use bracketing functions in the PASM modes but not the EXR or auto modes.  But this is a minor complaint as I am still figuring out how to use all the various options.Other cameras I considered are the less expensive and smaller/lighter S95, LX5, and XZ-1, but I preferred having a viewfinder and really liked the idea of the manual zoom lens.  Also I looked at the G12 and P7100 which both have viewfinders; in the end though I was swayed by the \"cool factor\" of the retro styled X10 and some great professional reviews I have read online.  The X10 was more expensive than these other options but I have not been disappointed with my decision.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best backpacking adventure camera", "Author": "Denis J.

My main camera is a Canon 5DII. But it weighs 2.5kg! Not good for hiking 40kms over 3 days or so! After 6 months of research (micro 4/3s Sony NEX etc) I settled on the Fuji x10. Sure the Sony has lower noise but the lenses are still too heavy and big. Ditto for the Panasonic and Olympus micro 4/3. And they are still fairly noisy. To make matters worse all their kit lenses are slow. This little x10 has a sensor that is a little noisy but the lens is a fast f2 - 2.8 throughout the focal range! It has a pro body of magnesium alloy. It has all the manual knobs to control aperture, shutter speed etc ( missing on Sony) and an inbuilt optical view finder. It's fast enough (better than G12) and small enough without being too small to actually use (Canon S100). How a camera handles is incredibly important. This little camera handles like a dream camera. It even has a cable release! You can tell it was designed for pro photographers not for mass market consumers or even prosumers. The extended dynamic range mode actually works! Unlike many other cameras claiming the same but not delivering! So this little camera stays with me everywhere. The iPhone 4S destroyed the entry level point and shoot camera market. I believe this little camera almost does the same to the entry level DSLR/kit lens market - that may be a bit of a stretch but it's not too far off. It certainly destroys entry level DSLRs with their horrible kit lenses, if bulk and weight are a priority. Game over! I've given it 5 stars not on an absolute scale but for quality of construction, image quality and handling in the backpacking/adventure camera marketplace. This may be a small marketplace but this is the best camera in that space.Additional comments added December 30,2011. I'm just back from a 2 day backpacking camping trip. I took 282 photos, no videos. With the LCD on when needed (i.e. while composing and taking photos, the battery still shows it has 100% capacity. I didn't need the spare battery.Additional comments 17/1/2012: the single worst feature of this camera is that you cannot use a polarising filter with the lens hood. You cannot use one without a lens hood either. For landscape work this is a mistake Fuji made with design.

Always had issues turning it ON. Took me 1-3 attempts to rotate the lens dial to get the thing ON. It never bothered me until 2 weeks back when the lens rotatory got very hard and I wasn't even able to turn it ON.So I called the Fuji repair center in NJ and was told to ship it back it. I was told this happens and there is a screw that needs to be adjusted. Spent a few dollars and shipped it to them. To my surprise, I received an 'estimate to repair' from them which said there is severe water damage, severe corrosion and that it has to be replaced for $542.I was shocked and tried arguing with them that I never took the camera into the water or into the rain. I asked them to ship it back to me.Guess what, I received a bag of parts today. Seriously?When I spoke to their manager today after seeing the parts and tried telling him there is a mild water stain inside on the aluminium plate inside and its NOT \"severely corroded interior\" as explained to me, he said its pretty much a dead camera and replacement is the only option. According to him, shipping parts to a customer is normal! We'll all go through training on assembling our cameras :)They finally agreed to put the parts together and ship it back to me but said they cannot guarantee it will work.I don't mind spending another $500. But  -1) How did the water drops enter the camera if these expensive P&S; cameras are properly sealed?2) How it is that the stain is inside only in one area and everything else including the circuit board looks untouched/unaffected inside (see pictures)?3) Why is it that you cannot fix the lens issue and stop focusing on the water stain?4) What's the guarantee that the stains were caused by me when I am 100% confident I never took it out in the rain or water. What's the guarantee that it's not someone else's camera?I am really hoping that someone at Fuji quality control or senior management reads this feedback.I don't mind spending another $542. Why would I not buy it from Amazon listed at $499 :)?And, why would I ever buy a Fuji again?They should either shut down their business or clean up their organization hosting this team where the service manager @ Fuji-NJ thinks that shipping a bag of parts to me was appropriate.Check the pictures out.

I think so.", "Author": "Coronet Blue", "ReviewID": "RGTMWQUFRYRZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the ancient days of film, my main camera was a Pentax 67.  People thought I was a better photographer than I really was because then as now, bigger is better.  So it was probably inevitable that I would end up with full-frame DSLRs.  These cameras are so good, I can almost forget how big and heavy they are.Still, there are times when a big SLR is too much.  Problem is, unlike the best compact 35mm film cameras (which were as good or better than 35mm SLRs), compact digital cameras are either not that good, or not that compact.  Of course what \"good\" is, is up to you.  If you think the output from an LX5 or S95 at 1600 ISO looks good, you can stop reading and save your $600.  But if you are looking for that point where the camera cannot get any smaller without giving up too much image quality, that's where the X10 resides.  I'm not going to go through all the features because the camera will probably be discontinued before I try everything.  But here is what you can expect from the X10:  Very good sharpness even in the corners at 28mm, low barrel distortion (although the camera is probably correcting), very respectable 8 x10 prints, noise that is both low and well handled, very good image quality at ISO 400 and usable image quality at ISO 800.  That the X10 can handle fairly extreme dynamic range without incinerating the highlights is icing on the cake.A few likes/dislikes.  The optical finder is excellent quality and has adequate dioptric correction.  If it was made by Leitz, this zoom finder alone would be $600.  However...unless you are focusing manually (a drag with the X10) when the camera beeps you really don't know what it is focusing on.  Thus, while I love the absence of distractions in the finder, I don't use it as much as I expected to.  As I have mentioned elsewhere, the front element is very exposed, the 40mm filter thread is ludicrous and the hood/adapter is barely better than nothing.  The strap is nothing to write home about and doesn't even have a piece of suede for your shoulder.  Unlike everybody else, I like the RAW button.  On the X10 there is not a huge difference in quality between RAW and jpg (and for now you have to use the tedious SilkyPix).  So, rather than fill the card with RAW files, I hit the button only rarely, if I really think I have something special.  The metal cap with felt liner is a cute touch--old timers will know that the felt wears out fast and the cap falls off, but how can you hate a metal lens cap?Is the X10 for you?  Obviously not if you want interchangeable lenses.  Having briefly had a m43 outfit, I think multiple lenses defeat the purpose of a small camera but if this were my only camera it would be a completely different story.  One thing in the X10's favor is that it produces very good results whether tweaked extensively or with everything just set to auto.  If you lament the absence of viewfinders on many small cameras, the X10 should fill the bill.  And lastly, although I swore I wouldn't mention this, yes, it is stylish, metal, made in Japan and even the box is pure Steve Jobs; it's black (of course) has an underexposed picture of the camera on matte paper and simply says \"X10\" as if to say, if you don't know what this is, you're not cool enough.(12/11/11) I'm going to add a little to this review.  I suppose it was inevitable but I think some people's expectations for this camera are a bit ridiculous.  If taking night shots is your main gig (and like everybody, you are a professional) no camera with a sensor this size is going to give the gorgeous, almost noise-free results you can get from a low megapixel, large sensor camera like a D700.  Nor is the X10 a Leica M9 with a zoom lens that costs $600.  And yes, the menus and the instruction manual are dense and confusing.  But so is the list of features.  Beyond (my opinion) unreasonable expectations, there does seem to be a serious issue with white clipping when shooting directly into a light source or specular highlight.  I've seen this with the Sigma DP1x so I know what it looks like (awful), but haven't been able to reproduce it with the X10.  Since virtually all sellers allow returns it should be easy enough to point the camera at the sun or a bright light and see what happens.  I must say, I'm glad I'm no longer in the photo industry because the amount of anger, not just at the manufacturer, but at anybody who doesn't have this problem (we're stupid and obviously not professionals) has really gotten out of hand.  Usually, I don't buy his \"good copy/bad copy\" nonsense but in this case I wonder if the problem really is limited to certain individual cameras.(2/22/12)  Took my 2000th photo with the X10 today and still no white orbs.  Now, the last thing I want to do is claim they don't exist or that they are in any way ok or acceptable.  I have no doubt they exist and they're not acceptable.  I don't seem to get them and the irony is that the cause of the problem, Fuji's EXR sensor, allows the camera to handle a somewhat greater brightness range without blowing the highlights vs. other small sensor cameras.  But it is this very same EXR sensor that is the source of the white spots and that's why Fuji's firmware update didn't change anything.  In other words, in high contrast situations, the X10 will hold more detail in the highlights--but if there is a super-bright pinpoint of light you may be in trouble.  The reason I say \"may\" is because I haven't encountered it.If the camera didn't perform as well as it does in all other respects it would be easy to say, forget it, at least until the situation is resolved (and if a different sensor is required, don't hold your breath).  But since the X10 has been great for my use, I'm in the unusual situation of advising against buying one, yet based on everything I've shot, I still give it 5 stars.  I bought this camera to replace a Lumix LX5 which didn't have any \"issues\" but never, on it's best day gave the quality I get from the X10.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Another winner by Fuji!", "Author": "M.

So when the X10 was announced and available for pre-order, I immediately jumped on it. The X10 is really an incredible camera from build to output. It definitely isn't a small camera when compared to the likes of the Canon S100, but it's not THAT much bigger than the XZ1 or the Canon G12 or Nikon P7100. The build quality is really solid, and I love the method of powering on the camera using the lens. I also love that the zoom works just like an SLR lens. It really feels like a shooter's camera in the hand. As for output, the quality of the sensor is very solid, and the high ISO noise levels are very good. For someone who is looking for an advanced point and shoot camera, I really could not recommend this camera more. It's a blast to shoot with and there's so much one can do with it!", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beyond my expectations", "Author": "Jay Gatsby", "ReviewID": "RL4370ABI0WVH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After years of lugging around a Canon DSLR, on vacations. I decided to buy a camera that would be easier and lighter to carry around. But not just an ordinary point and shoot, but something with more features if I decide to be creative. I've been a Canon fan all my life, so my natural inclination would be to test the G12, which had a lot of good reviews. I liked the G12, it had external controls that were quickly accessable and the images were quite good and I intended to keep it until the display exhibited problems by not coming on at times.  Next I upgraded to the G1X, because of the larger CMOS sensor and the fairly decent reviews.  After 20 test shots, the display went black and never came back on, so paying more doesn't necessary give you a better product. In my opinion,the G12 took sharper pictures than the G1X and you can take repeated shots much faster.  My last camera to try was the Fuji X10, and one of the unique features this camera has that made me decide to consider it was the manual zoom on the lens barrel as oppose to the power zoom on the majority of all point and shoots. Manual zooms are faster and more accurate, power zooms are slow, and it either falls short or over the mark and you constantly have to play with the switch to get close to that point. I am extremely impressed with the X10, the images are sharp even in low light without flash, colors are vibrant and with it's 2.0-2.8 lens, you can take multi shots very quickly. The super macro feature can focus as close as 1 cm to the subject.  To sum it up, the X10 is a hi tech point and shoot with a lot of creative functions similar to a DSLR, but definitely not a replacement for it. If you want a camera that takes very good pictures and gives you the flexibilty to be creative and enhance your overall enjoyment, this one fits the bill.  These are my observations and experiences and everyone has their likes and dislikes and I don't proclaim myself an expert, only a person that enjoys taking pictures. You have to try it yourself to be sure.

Aperture, ISO, shutter speed, etc.).I'll be writing pros and cons on 7 features which I believe makes this camera unique: the manual zoom lens, optical view finder (OVF), EXR modes, Fujifilm colors, the black retro-style camera body, pop-up flash, and the sensor size.Plus additional info that's worth noting.1) Manual zoom lensPros:- Quick zooming from wide to tele- Saves battery- Won't forget to turn it off- Has image stabilization and f/2.0-2.8 wide aperture for capturing light faster than most compact camerasCons:- Requires two hand to operate- May be stiff for some people to turn it on (not me though)- Other people who'll take pictures for you (ex. on your vacation) might not know how to turn it on2) OVFPros:- Useful on sunny days when you can't see your LCD screen- Zooms through out all focal length- Real time view of your scene- Clear and brightCons:- Not 100% coverage (hard to accurately compose with it)- Absolutely no information (exposure, aperture, shutter speed, etc... nothing)3) EXR modesPros:- Camera analyzes scene and chooses best exposure for best image quality- Creates \"above average\" image by combining pixels in some situations (ex. low light)Cons:- No minor adjustments. Everything is automatic once set- Some results combines pixels and become automatically adjusted to medium (approximately down to 6 megapixels)4) Fujifilm colorsPros:- Exclusive Provia, Astia, and Velvia film simulation settingsCons:- Those who don't like the film simulation colors, won't like it5) Black retro-style bodyPros:- Those who love its looks, love it- Metal materials (top and bottom) for sturdy feel- Light weight and to the point controls (not necessarily the menus inside)- Optional soft release insertCons:- Those who don't like its looks, won't like it- Small buttons- No articulated screen (doesn't matter for me)- Not pocketable6) Pop-up FlashPros:- Sync up to 1/1000 of a secondCons:- Have to pop-it-up for access to flash- Obviously not as powerful as external flashes7) Sensor sizePros:- Larger and \"better\" image quality than your average compact camera- Little more access to bokehCons:- Little less access to large depth of fieldOther information worth noting:- May take time to get use to all the functions of the camera. Ex. Hold green play button to review pictures while manual zoom is set to off.- AF speed is quick. If you're close, you may need to switch to macro mode. AF accuracy, from my usage, has been about 95% (usually misses in low light and busy scenes).- I would recommend getting the fastest SD cards like SanDisk Extreme Pro and 1-2 extra batteries especially if shooting in RAW or shooting videos.- There's no built in Neutral Density (ND) filter, and to attach a filter, you need to buy an adapter and hood separately.Ultimately, I would recommend this camera to those who:1) Wants quick zooming from wide to tele2) Needs an OVF on a camera3) Needs quick analysis of the scene and have the camera automatically set exposure4) Loves Fujifilm colors5) Loves the retro-style design6) Needs 1/1000 of a second flash sync speed7) Is fine with above \"average\" image quality in compact camera departmentThanks.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Mixed feelings about the X10", "Author": "S.

Is well made. Has a decent optical viewfinder. A nice LCD on back. The best Auto mode I have ever seen on a camera.However, with all that is great about this camera. There are a number of things about the X10 that really annoy the hell out of me.1) Why does the camera sometimes take as long as 8 seconds after you turn it on to \"boot up\" and be ready to shoot? This is incredibly annoying. Especially if you want to shoot something real quickly but have to wait until the camera gets its act together and miss the shot.2) The Autofocus system on this camera has major issues. Why does it work properly one second and not the other? After about 3 shots with the camera it starts acting up and from then on it flashes red with about every other shot. However, resetting the camera can sometimes fix the problem.3) The image stabilization is flaky on this camera. In about 1 in every 10 shots it's a problem. To me it's not a big deal as the other two things but still annoying.Luckily I have not seen the \"white blobs\" on the images I have taken with this camera.This camera really has potential but is also in dire need of a firmware upgrade. And liked I said, taking into account its sensor size.. it takes some incredibly nice pictures. But unless you're very patient and tolerant of a camera which has major flaws... I would wait until Fuji releases a firmware update to address performance issues first. And I also think the price needs to drop about $100 for this camera.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "flawed camera, great images, fun to shoot", "Author": "P.

HAve tried the G series, (9 and 10), Canon S 90 and 95, Panasonic LX3, Leica.  Have found them all wanting in some areas.  The X10 is a pretty good camera for this type of photography.  The colors are good, lens is fast and menus are not as confusing as some would have you believe.  The EXR function is a nice flexible idiot proof shooting mode, and there is pretty good customization for a 600 dollar range camera.  I was also looking at the Olympus, but decided to hold off given the recent economic debacles of Olympus- if they run into credit issues they will shut down pretty fast and accessories and lenses would be hard to get.  Panasonic seems to have gotten off track recently with their 4/3 system.  So, it is a good compromise and it takes good pictures with great color tones.  Perfect?

I called again and was told that they had taken down hundreds of email addresses incorrectly and that the emails had been returned to them. The sent me instructions on how to return the camera to them at my own expense. I sent it in and a week and a half later they sent the repaired unit back, overnight delivery.A couple of weeks later they sent an email stating that they had forgotten to perform a step in the repair which could cause unacceptably noisy photographs and would send me a pre paid shipping label and would repair the camera within 2 days of receiving it. Two weeks went by and the label never came. I called them again and they said they would send a label. However they sent the label Fedex ground, so it would take a week to get to me. I did not want to wait that long so I sent the camera back Fedex overnight at my own expense. It took them a week to fix the camera (not 2 days as promised) and then they shipped to back to me Fedex Ground, which will take a week to get to me.

The build quality sure seems solid & excellent (especially since it's made in Japan), the buttons and dials responsive, and everything else appears good on the surface. No white orbs were present, and the latest firmware came pre-installed, with a body serial number in the 24xx range (so it was new stock). However, after a couple of hours of use, glaring problems become apparent. At first the camera wouldn't properly shut down -- and nothing would fix it short of a battery removal. I simply chalked it up to temporary glitch, and kept using the camera. Everything seemed fine for a short while. Then the camera would stop reading the memory card and brought up an error message on screen, and wouldn't shut down again. Again, the battery had to be removed to cycle the power. I tried different memory cards and even formatted them, to no avail. Then the screen developed weird gray horizontal lines. Sadly, this X10 is on its way back to Amazon for a refund. Hopefully others are luckier with theirs![Edit: We were able to get a second X10, this one has a serial number in the 22xx range. For those wondering, no orbs seen in this copy, either.

Some people may not like it, but I love it.- Many hardware controls for adjusting parameters- A viewfinder, even in vestigial form, is more than you get on other P&S; cameras.- Flash seems above average for a P&S.;- Very solid build. Not quite pocketable, but feels good in hand.- Above average video quality combined with stereo mics. Will handily beat a cell phone.Cons:- As noted elsewhere, below par battery life, largely due to fuji using a tiny battery. Happily, clone batteries are quite common and cheap.- Uses USB PTP mode for transferring pictures, rather than the old standby of showing up like a usb drive. I personally find this annoying, but it's livable, and of course one can just pop the card out and into a card reader to get pictures. Just as long as you don't leave the card in the reader and take off to a concert without it...- Has lens cap instead of automatic shutters on other cameras. On the plus side, none of the downsides of shutters (sticking, damaging lens, etc) and it provides actual protection, along with allowing you to use screw-in filters. On the downside, it has no tether and of course you have to take it off.- Viewfinder provides no information. If you need that info, look towards the X20 which has a HUD in its viewfinder.- Fuji case is just short of $100. However, third party cases can be bought for $20 that will get the job done.Notes:Amazon supplied units are new stock that do not suffer from the infamous orbs problem.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"},

I took the x10 on a John Muir Trail thru hike of 200 miles which gave it three weeks of abuse. Most of my review pertains to outdoor photography. I had it in a padded pouch on my hip belt. The camera got knocked around a few times while swinging the pack off. It is solidly built and worth the little extra weight. I find the x10 to be an excellent compromise of an point and shoot and SLR ;I have owned both. This camera takes great pictures. I love the EXR mode. I found the battery life to be excellent as long as you don't constantly review your pictures. I also find the camera to be easy to use. It is set up and looks like the old SLR's, with controls that you use most often at your finger tips. Hardly any need to be going back into the menu for settings. It shoots clean, crisp pictures and is excellent in low light. It is simple to go to manual aperture or shutter speed mode. The optical view finder was very helpful on those sunny days. The view finder does a decent job of simulating your shot but you have no idea of focus or settings. If I needed to use a flash, simply hit the button and it pops up ready to use. No annoying shots with a flash when I did not want to use it. UV and polarizing filters are now available in the proper lens size so that they screw right onto the end of the lens without an adapter. I shot some video on the trip and the x10 did very well. Clean video and sound and easy to use.  I am very happy I purchased the x10.

That makes no sense since the camera's JPEGS have to come from the same RAW file.  But something is definitely screwy.  So I save both the RAW and JPEG and use the JPEG except for the most unusual cases.  So my enthusiasm for this camera has been somewhat reduced.  Original review below:_____________________________________I am responsible for a church web site and so I bought this to use in situations where the slap of a DSLR mirror would be distracting.  It gets used a lot, often in preference to larger cameras, and it has the eye level viewfinder which I find essential.  It stays in the car glove compartment so it is always available.  People are often intimidated when I stick a Nikon with a large lens in their face.  But they are far more comfortable when they see this inconspicuous camera in use.  Suffice it to say, I am glad I spent the money.However, there is an issue with the RAW files.  For reasons I cannot understand, when I manipulate the RAW files in Lightroom 4 I cannot obtain images with the apparent resolution of the JPEGs the camera produces, presumably from the same RAW files.  It is my understanding that this is also the case with other RAW converters.

I was aware of the orb issue when I bought the camera, but it really has not been a problem for me. I have not had an orb ruin a picture yet, but I am certain that eventually I might encounter such a situation. The pluses of the X10 far outweigh the minuses.The optical viewfinder was one of the main selling points for me, and it has not been a disappointment. There is no information in the viewfinder, but the auto focus and auto exposure are very accurate, and one can shoot with confidence with the OVF.

I originally thought I was going to go with a Nikon V1, but after comparing this camera and the V1, it was a pretty easy choice. The Fuji is well built, and looks pretty classy as it has sort of a retro camera feel to it. It's not necessarily a pocket camera, but something to throw in a jacket pocket or keep in a purse.I had been very skeptical about getting a \"point and shoot\" camera, as I love the way a traditional DSLR works, and didn't think I could be inspired by something sooooo....well point and shoot. However after playing around with and taking it out with me on a couple photo excursions, I was quickly impressed by the manual controls on the camera, and how easy they were to change. I was even more impressed however, by the EXR mode, which basically chooses everything for you, but VERY VERY intelligently.I never shoot in anything but manual, but with this camera, I can trust the EXR mode to get me a good quick shot if need be. This is more than a point and shoot camera. I would suggest it to any photographer that is looking for something smaller than their DSLR that they can still feel comfortable getting a good photo out of. It is great quality for what it is. Is it DSLR quality? Well, not necessarily, but it also isn't priced with most DSLR's for that purpose. Does it get the perfect shot EVERY time? Well, not necessarily, but neither does my D700 when I am running it on manual!I would recommend this camera over any in the same price point, or even higher price points (such as the Nikon V1). I originally thought it would try it out, and if I didn't like itI I would just return it. (which I though I would most likely do) however, it has grown on me quite quickly, and the convenience mixed with the photo quality is certainly hard to beat!", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quirky, but neat little camera", "Author": "Eric Williams \"socratease\"", "ReviewID": "R1QXHFR9DN1DYZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a camera to replace my ageing Canon PowerShot S60 which was not only obsolete but had suddenly died.  It was a very good camera for motorcycle trips, being small enough to pack yet big enough not to slip out of gloved hands, and the optical viewfinder could be used with my distance-viewing glasses on.  I was on the waiting list for the S100, but the reviews that were trickling out indicated the IQ wasn't noticeably better than other compact cameras, and it was missing the OVF.  When I started hearing about the X10 I jumped ship, cancelled my S100 order and ordered the Fuji.Being a dyed-in-the-wool Canon guy (from 10D to S60 to 7D), the controls of the X10 take a little getting used to, but all the essential settings and most of the optional ones are there, just under different names.  The camera feels very solid in the hand with smooth, positively operating controls, with the possible exception of the main wheel which has a fair amount of play in it and is a bit too easy to jog in Manual and other mode.  Combined with the metal body, this makes the X10 confidence-inspiring.  The small body is a bit difficult to grip in a way that keeps it stable while tripping the shutter.  It's worth some time to practice this and develop a technique to get the sharpest image possible, the built-in image stabilization can only do so much.  After a few trials I was able to produce some pictures of my cats that were sharp down to the pixel level where you could count the hairs, which shows the lens and sensor are capable of a very high level of detail capture.  Overall I am very pleased with the IQ from this camera.The viewfinder is bare bones with no additional information, but that is just fine for me.  The image in the OVF is about 85% of the final picture, so don't expect to be able to frame pictures exactly where you want without the LCD display.  If you leave the camera focus point in the center it's easy to focus on the right spot with the viewfinder and then reframe before tripping the shutter.The X10 does have a few minor flaws and missed opportunities.  The battery life doesn't appear to be great, I got slightly over 100 pictures out of the first charge, though I did have the display on bright and did a lot of picture reviewing as I showed it off.  Fortunately, spare batteries are both small and reasonably priced.  The camera has no remote shutter release, nor any other mechanism other than a 10-second count-down timer to delay the picture.  This would have been an easy thing for Fuji to have added and would have helped travel pictures avoid the \"missing Dad\" syndrome.  The automatic exposure bracketing is limited to +/-1 f-stop, which is too small for HDR (high dynamic range) processing, this would also have been easy to fix.I've read some comments where people thought other cameras in the micro 4/3 class gave better performance for about the same price.  But every time I checked out the models they recommended, they either didn't have an OVF, needed multiple lenses to cover the same focal length range (at added expense), were significantly larger, or significantly more expensive.

It's a camera that's better suited to the person who wants to take jpegs straight out of the camera rather than shoot RAW and process yourself. There still seems to be confusion about whether in RAW, or at least when in RAW, you are actually getting a 12 megapixel image or a 6 megapixel one. Be aware of this if you need big prints.A more serious drawback, for my usage, which involves much night time photography, is that it has a serious flaw that Fuji has acknowledged and says it is fixing. It was feared this issue was caused by hardware, but the company has suggested that it may be a processing issue that it will fix in a new firmware update.The issue is poor handling of highlights, and is variously known as \"disks\", \"orbs\", \"WDS\", \"scheiben\", and \"soucoupes\".Flare or very strong specular highlights sometimes eventually resolve into hard white circles, larger than the original light source. It looks as if someone has taken a hole punch to your image. If you do night photography, photography with strong specular highlights, shoot chrome, or concerts with lights, reflections, or sunsets, you may end up with these hard-edged white circles.Maybe it won't affect YOUR shooting conditions, but be aware of it before you buy. It's a shame because this is a horrible weakness in a superb little body.The only other issue I have with it is the focus, which can be slow in certain circumstances, and which has occasionally snapped out of focus just as I shot.-----The latest news is that Fuji have acknowledged the sensor flaw, or have come as close to it as their lawyers will allow, and are replacing the sensors in already purchased cameras as of May.

I was among the early buyers of the X10 and my original unit displayed the white orb problem. I returned my original camera to Fuji USA under warranty and Fuji provided a brand new replacement camera. [Note: my original camera was in mint condition so that may be why I received a new one in return] I believe Fuji deserves 6 stars here. They could have marginalized or ignored the white orb issue but instead they confronted it head on with a very reasonable solution. [Revised image sensor] Bravo. I will continue to buy Fuji products in the future.BTW - the new camera still takes exceptional pictures. I regard the X10 as an exceptional 6 megapixel shooter when using the EXR modes. I regard it as a closer to average 12 megapixel shooter without the benefit of the EXR modes. This camera is a digicam so the image quality will never replace an SLR. However, the excellent lens and [6 megapixel] EXR modes have allowed me to take pictures that rival and even beat in some cases the performance from my previous generation SLR cameras. Not bad at all for a camera that fits in a cargo shorts pocket. Visit the X10 review on dpreview.com to learn how to take advantage of the EXR capability in all modes - S, A, and M for example.Strengths: Excellent, FAST lens. Much better then the Sony RX100 for example. This keeps the ISOs usually between 200 and 400 even in incredibly low light conditions. Excellent ergonomics with a suitable number of buttons for direct control. EXR modes will eliminate in most cases and substantially reduce in others common issues of blown highlights or low light / high ISO noise. The burst mode is excellent with full metering and autofocus between shots.Weaknesses: The sensor does not resolve enough detail for large prints. However it remains the perfect camera for 4X6, 5X7 and in some cases 8X10 prints. Battery life is only adequate. You will need a spare for a full day of shooting. Movie quality is good but not great. You will notice scaling artifacts if you look for them.Overall, this is an amazing little camera.

It is a very flexible camera that will allow you to shoot with outstanding scene and auto modes or allow you to fine-tune settings to your heart's content.

So far, I LOVE this piece. Solid build quality with metal body, tight controls, and solid clicking buttons/dials. Photo quality is great for a compact camera (I'm not comparing this to DSLR photo quality b/c that would just be ridiculous). The camera is responsive with quick focus and quick shots. I did get a few shots where the focus was on the wrong object, but so far this hasn't become a nuisance. The X10 is packed with features including panorama, which can be used for vertical and horizontal panoramas.Why not 5 stars? I really wish this had the hydrid optical viewfinder, but I could live without it. I believe the upgraded X20 has it, but I couldn't justify paying $250 more for essentially the same camera. Also, focus in movie mode wasn't too great. The camera was slow to focus on subjects as I moved the camera.I'm taking a weeklong road trip next week and will be using this camera to take photos with friends as well as candids and landscapes.  I will update this review after my trip. Hope I'm just as happy after my return!*Side Note: I bought this camera through an Amazon vendor (Cardinal Camera). It was listed as new, but I received a USED product! The box was open, battery was out of its packaging and inside the camera, and the camera already had over 1,000 shots! I was pretty upset about that, but Amazon's customer service kicked in and saved the day! They gave me the option of returning for a new one or receiving 20% cash back. I chose the cash back since the camera is functionally perfect (as far as I know so far). I ended up paying $280!  Thanks Amazon!**UPDATE!Just came back from my 1 week road trip with lots of usage on the X10. A few edits/adds to my original review. Inaccurate focus can be a bit annoying. Sometimes it will focus on the wrong subject, other times I'll press the shutter button halfway to focus, but it won't adjust focus at all. A few times it focused, but did not give the focus indicating \"beep\" sound (not a big deal). Of the ~600+ shots I took, the focus issues occurred about 20-30 times. Still less than 1% of the time and it's acceptable IMO...just slightly annoying.Another thing I noticed is that the \"Auto\" setting tends to overexpose photos in certain light conditions. Fortunately, it has the exposure control dial. I have yet to figure out exactly what type of conditions I need to tone down the exposure dial for.Battery life is low. I did get by shooting the entire day by not using the LCD screen. Pics will show up for 1.5 sec on the screen after each shot, which sucks up juice. This could also be turned off, but then you can't be sure the camera focused correctly. The hybrid viewfinder on the X20 would really help in this case since you'll know where the camera is focusing. Also, I wish there was a way to review photos without having to turn the lens to \"on\". When I wanted to view photos, I found myself having the take the lens cap off and twisting the lens on. I felt like this would increase risk of my scratching the lens. Just pressing the \"play\" button on the X10 won't let you review photos.Build quality remains excellent. Zoom is SUPER useful (for my style of shooting anyway). For what I paid, I'm extremely happy. I do eventually want to upgrade to the X20 once the price drops since it seems to have taken care of the issues I just mentioned on the X10.

This is a feature laden Compact Camera with excellent build quality.By the way I tried to recreate the white blob syndrome some users complain about, but at this point with no luck. I understand it's an issue with some compact cameras with smaller sensors. I'm not really surprised the X10 might have this problem too. I'm certain all compacts have or have the potential to come across this problem. It's plain physics folks! If that's a concern for you, you might want to consider a full frame camera like the Leica M9 or Canon 5d Mk I or II.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent small camera", "Author": "georgehd \"georgehd\"", "ReviewID": "R1JPQYCO3K4G35", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After struggling with the Nikon P7000 I finally gave up and purchased the Fuji X10.  What an amazing difference.  For anyone who is used to using an SLR, this is an excellent backup or small camera to carry when you do not want to carry a larger SLR.  One should review on line reviews of this camera versus the Nikon P7100 and the Canon G12.  It would appear that the Fuji camera is a better designed camera.  I have not used it long enough to comment on image quality; however, a friend has been using this camera and had told me that it is excellent.  A camera store salesman who uses Nikon SLRs purchased this camera as soon as it arrived in the store.  That is always a good recommendation.There is now an excellent instruction manual, available from Amazon, Alexander White, Photographer's Guide to the Fuji X10.  It is much more clear than the manual that comes with the camera.Five months later - this camera is fantastic.  I took it and a Nikon D7000 on a trip to Alaska and believe that I have more excellent images using the F10.  A real surprise.  The most wonderful thing about this camera is that it is very easy to use.  The EXR mode is very good.  Face recognition is excellent.  My only complaint is the lens cap and that can be replaced with one that stays on the camera.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "I wish I could", "Author": "S.

For my taste, it has a few UI quirks and probably not the most intuitive menu interface (even slightly more odd than the x100 IMO).  Still, those weren't deal breakers by any means.I used the camera for 3 days until I realized it's not for me.I have an X100 which I think is one of the best digital cameras I have ever used and I couldn't wait to get the X10 as a companion.  Once I got it I realized that I needed both hands to operate it.  The issue arises because of the unique design of the X10's barrel lens.  You have to twist the zoom barrel to turn the camera on and then to operate the zoom.  Yes, I knew this before buying it but somehow in real-world use it became a nuisance. Needing two hands to operate the camera didn't allow for quick-draw photos.I imagined trying to operate it on a ski trip or while mountain biking and it didn't make sense.  The bokeh was also much less than I had anticipated even though I knew the sensor was much smaller than the X100.  And I wish the lens was a 24mm after using it.Finally- the size- yes, it probably competes with the Canon G series cameras so the size makes sense.  Even though it's gorgeously proportioned, it was just a hair too big for me (I typically like bigger, heavier cameras but somehow it seemed too close to the X100 in size to warrant carrying both).Again, it's beautiful, shoots great photos and is even quicker than the X100.  Ultimately It's a camera I would like to own but doesn't look like I would use it often.  I keep reaching for the X100.Instead of the X10, I'll probably purchase a small shirt-pocketable POS with zoom to round out the collection.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best In Its Class", "Author": "Ronald James Smith \"AquaDoc\"", "ReviewID": "R1KEH0YDHDJHF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera and I will be surprised if dpreview doesnt give it a gold rating.As most pros know it is not the Pixel numbers but combination of other factors.The Leica digilux one 6 MP will shoot some of the best images you could ever want and it was a tank and generations ago, So really it is the quality of the combination of lens and Sensor etc. This camera has the EXR sensor that is larger then almost any compact camera and it is a CMOS sensor not ccd.It has a nice magnesium body and well built unlike the review mentioning the Cannon 3100and the quality when compared to the Canon 3100 as one reviewer said is weak. I like the D3I 18mp from Cannon and that is a better comparision to this camera and costs more just for the body.But to compete with the x10 it needs a 400.00 plus lens.SO the price on this camera is cheap and you will see people wanting this camera for a long time.It is just about as large as a compact can be.  I took yesteday a non studio exr 6mp high Dynamic Range portrait using the SP photo setting and it compares to any great portrait I have taken. I studied briefly under Alfred Eisenstaedt as a young man and he used a film camera 35mm Leica most of the time. I asked him why he was so great and he denied that but said (your eye)  great photos start not with the camera but the composition.He also said the guys in the lab can take a 35mm negative( about 24 mp Equivalent) and make it into a poster of Sophia Loren that looks outstanding.He also used the small size of a Leica 35 as an advantage over when he had to use the intimidating Graflex cameras. He would love this camera for its build, Fast Lens,Usable Zoom,and in camera Raw processing capabilities ( your own lab) a quick to start up Photojournalists camera that is well built.  1 cm super macros are excellent.Portraits terrific.  Ok some cons Are the adapter for 52mm filters are expensive at least for now as well as a good case. That will change as others jump in.It is a complex camera and comes with a substandard Manual that forces you to learn on your own, via a blog, or mayby a Magic lantern type publication will be along soon.The panoramic sweep is awesome but difficult to master.Think Widelux on a budget.The underpowered flash is perfect for Portraits.  I have taken semi pro photos for over 50 years and I was able to take a great real world portrait with this camera at 6mp EXR with great dynamic range (doubled the sensors used) using the flash and Sp setting for portraits that is outstanding.It is much better then my Panasonic LX3 that I had to buy a finder for the LX5 lens didnt take it up a notch and in most cases is as good as my Cannon T3i and 60mm efs lens ,at half the price, in a much smaller package.  This camera is better suited to a semi pro experenced Photographer or dedicated amature willing to decipher the manual which should also come with a magnyfying glass.This camera is better in some respects to the twice the price x100.

I still use my D7000 for portraits or landscapes as well as anything that I am planning on doing a lot of post processing, but with that said, most of my shots are with this camera.  I love how easy it is to grab and to take great shots.  I just turn it to EXR and shoot away, unless there are certain effects that I am going for.

This camera is pretty simple to use, but still has a crapload of features if you really want to get into all the details.  In EXR mode, it will automatically switch to HDR mode, HD mode, or low light mode; 90% of the time this is all you need.  It does shoot raw, and the videos are also good.  The fit and feel is great, nice and solid.  The only issue that I can see would be this \"white orb\" issue is the sensor is an older one.  You can look it up online, but here is a synopsis- if you take a picture with some of the X10s, a bright spot (sun reflecting on a silver ball) will be overly large and appear as a white circle.  This has been remedied with the new sensor, but you can still get an old sensor and there is no easy way to tell which one you have.  I have tried to call customer service to determine if mine is afflicted with this condition, but have not been able to get a good answer.

I already have a 5d MKII, 5D and 40D with a wide assortment of excellent lenses.All of the above have been nicely satisfied with the Fujifilm X10.I just made some 8x10 inch prints and compared them head to head with those of the same scene from my 5D (both 12 megapixel sensors).  At this size you would be hard pressed to see any difference between the two.  One of the things the Fuji has going for it is a really sharp f2.0-2.8 lens.  So I was able to shoot with the Fuji at f4 at ISO 100 but had to go to f8 and ISO 400 with the 5D to get comparable DOF and reasonable shutter speed.I have done some images at high ISO, up to 3200.  Taking advantage of pixel binning, the results are quite good.Size:  for me this was an important consideration.  Height and width are not much different than the small dSLRs.  However, the Fuji with lens is a lot thinner.  It fits readily into a jacket pocket, but not a shirt or pants pocket.  I considered a micro 4/3 \"system\" but again, the depth is smaller for the Fuji.  I know the high ISO performance is better with the larger sensor micro 4/3 systems, but this offset by the faster lens of the Fuji.Handling:  Not bad.  I really like the manual zoom.  Controls are well-laid out, and I am getting used to the menu system.  The optical viewfinder is usable, but contains no information and includes 85% of the subject.  A major improvement would be an indication of the of the center point to aid in precise focusing.The way the Fuji X10 treats specular highlights has received a lot of press on the various equipment forums.

It's less \"pocketable\" than other smaller cameras. But it is smaller than any dslr or bridge camera. Adding the optional hood adds to the bulk, however.The image quality is \"very good.\" Some say excellent. But there is some noise present even at low iso's. As a result, i like to shoot RAW+jpg; the in-camera jpg processing is very good, but I like to have the option of editing myself. Additionally, there are options to set the aggressiveness of noise handling and sharpness, among other things.I find the type of noise interesting -- it is not the grainy noise of other cameras; but I think it imparts a subjectively interesting quality to the photos that coincides with its retro appearance. It's possible to get clean files (especially at low iso's), but if super clean images is your primary concern, a nikon or canon might be a better choice. I suggest looking at some images at pbase and flickr to see the kinds of images other people are getting -- there are some very nice examples.The fast lens makes this a versatile camera with few peers. f2.0 - 2.8. wow. it also has the ability to go to very high iso's (but the highest only if RAW is turned off). of course there is more noise in the higher iso's, but the resulting images are more useful than other small camera's pictures with high iso.If you are new to fuji, there will be a learning curve to figure out the menus and settings; but that's true of anything new.I'm sure there's more I could say; this may not be for everyone-- maybe it costs too much, maybe they will take issue with the noise in the images, maybe it's too bulky, maybe this, maybe that...

Sensor upgrade solved the \"white circles\" problem.I don't live in the U.S. but the local Fujifilm service center accepted the camera under warranty, covered all shipping expenses and replaced the sensor with a new one. As other reviewer said, I also would give them six stars for this if I could. The \"white circles\" caused by sensor blooming are gone and the picture quality was not affected. I now give it a 4 1/2 stars rating, the missing half star is because the battery life is not good enough.Original review.I tested this camera with about 250 shoots.  The firmware is version 1.02. Camera adjustments: Auto ISO limit set to 400, all other set to factory defaults. No flash. Shoot the same scene twice, modes P and Auto only. These settings allowed me to compare with other cameras I have used before, both SLR and point-and-shoot. There are other reviews with the good things about this camera, the main shortcomings to me are the IS system and the way it handles the overexposed areas.Image stabilization system performance. The camera always shows the blur warning when the shutter speed is below 1/30 sec (wide angle, 28 mm) or 1/60 sec (full telephoto, 112 mm), the pictures are not sharp. There was no noticeable difference shooting the same scene using all the IS settings available, including image stabilization off.  The IS performance is no good enough; with the same settings the old Coolpix P3 can take more useful pictures at 1/8 sec than the X10 at 1/15.Exposure Metering.  The night shoots of city streets have a lot of overexposure on the passing cars front and rear lights and sometimes on the street lights, compared to other cameras. The problem is that the overexposed lights on any size are rendered with a black outline around them; there is no gradation from the overexposed area to the surrounding ones.To get good night pictures with no tripod I had to use manual exposure and ISO 3200, but as usual higher ISO means more noise. I miss the capability to shoot at ISO 800 or ISO 400 with no tripod.I will keep my X10 for other reasons and hope that Fuji fixes these issues with the next firmware update. For now, the two missing stars are because of the sub-standard IS and the black outline around overexposed areas.Update February 15, 2012.The IS problem was fixed after installing the 1.03 firmware update. This issue is not mentioned on Fuji's download page, but whatever it was the cause now the image stabilization is working. The blur warning is still there as described above but now I have been able to take acceptable pictures at 1/4 sec (28 mm) with no tripod.The problem with overexposed highlights remains the same in both RAW and JPEG, there is no noticeable improvement from firmware 1.02 to 1.03. Since the RAW file format is the sensor's data unprocessed, this problem is caused by an obvious sensor design or manufacturing defect. It is worst at low ISO settings, the use of auto-exposure and 3200 ISO eliminates this effect at the expense of increasing the noise.Here in Amazon and in other web sites there are reviews from some owners whose camera does not have the problem. The fact is that there are cameras that have it, so when you shop for an X10 you are risking to get a defective one.If you want to take pictures of night cityscapes or another kind of scenes with bright highlights and you will take them below 1600-3200 ISO, then this camera is not for you. In the absence of bright highlights you will get fine photos at low ISO.These problems and limitations are not what I expected for a $600 camera, point and shot or not.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best in its class (for now)", "Author": "ATK \"ATK\"", "ReviewID": "R3CVP8MXLBW7HS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been looking this kind of compact camera for a year.

Due to the nature of photography I usually carry around a small, quiet and a plain camera. Before I got Fuji X10, I waited for almost a decade for an affordable digital camera that can replace my old Voigtlander Bessa R. I bought Fuji X10 recently, and I think that the waiting is finally over.I can easily say that Fuji X10 is a stealth pocket Hercules, a very handy and a powerful camera. If you are into photographing the moment, I would say go for it. I also tried Fuji X100 previously, but didn't like it. I found X100 heavy and slow. I decided on X10 due to its focus speed and the lens dial in the front. At first glance it looks like my old Voightlander but smaller. The camera itself looks stylish, 1950s retro design look. Lens cap is metal (one of the coolest part of the camera) and slips on the lens, it's in right tightness and easy to take it off and on. The camera body is made tough, all buttons are \"right\" tight when rotating. Fuji X10's CMOS sensor enables you to take the picture without a delay. The zoom ring has 35mm equivalent lens sizes 28, 35, 50, 85, 112 and easy to operate. The camera can shoot in RAW, which is a bonus feature of the camera. The built in lens is very fast, F2 at 28mm and F2.8 at 112mm. You can shoot in complete Manual mode by setting Aperture and the Speed values by yourself. The results are glass sharp and overall exposure is correct.  ISO rating goes upto 12800 ASA. This means most of the time you can photograph at night without using a flash or a tripod. The \"click\" sound after pressing the button is absolutely classic, just like an old Leica. You can disable the click sound and put the camera in complete silent mode, which makes my new digital camera almost invincible.I am suprisingly delighted with my first ever Fuji camera.

Soon this problem was discussed on all the photo enthusiast sites on the web and in many magazines: it became known as the white \"ORB\" problem. Look it up un Google to see the extent of the unhappiness this caused X10 owners. This makes the X10 unusable at night and also spoils many daylight shots where highlights appear in the picture. For months Fujifilm ignored all the complaints. After several months they finally admitted that the camera had a problem and they offered a Firmware fix. I installed the firmware fix, but the problem remained. After a while, it became apparent to all owners that the firmware fix did not solve the ORB problem. More months went by. I put my camera away and started using a Lumix LX5 (great camera, by the way). Recently I found out that Fujifilm finally decided to adopt the right solution to the problem with the white orbs in the X10 and offered a free imager replacement to all owners of the X10 camera. I was pleased to see a company stand behind their products (although belatedly). Imagine my surprise when I contacted Fujifilm and I was told that in order to have my camera finally put right by replacing the faulty imager, I would be charged $140 in labor charges. No free replacement, then! This is because my camera is out of warranty! Of course it is! Fujifilm wasted a year trying to fix the problem with an ineffective firmware update: gone was the warranty by the time this was done! They should have offered replacement of the faulty imager right away, instead of frittering our warranty time away...but I guess this was to their advantage. So, the reason for this lengthy post is to warn interested buyers of a couple of potential pitfalls:1. I received poor customer support by Fujifilm2. Many X10 cameras with the old, faulty sensor are still being sold. There is no indication on the cameras with the new sensor, that they are, in fact, the new version.3. Beware of the resolution claims made for this camera: when using the EXR modes for High Dynamic Range and Low Light, the resolution falls from 12MP to 6MP.4. I was also disappointed by the very short life of the batteryBy the way, I own 4 Fujifilm digital cameras (only one is an X10), so I was a good customer for Fujifilm. No more. Once bitten, twice shy.

The orbs might be annoying to the snobbier X10 owners, but 9 people out of 10 won't even notice and the orbs only appear in 1 photo out of 10.This camera is ideal for high quality quick-shooting. Set the dial to \"P\" and you need no skills (besides the obvious eye for composition) to capture a great image. Likewise, setting it to the semi-auto or full manual mode(s) offers a great way to become a self-taught photographer or, if you already know the trade, sharpen your discipline.There's a bit of a learning curve if you've never shot on an X100s or X20. I normally shoot 35mm film or with full-frame to medium format DSLRs and it took me a few hours to gain control over my images in Manual mode.Some accessories to consider: an adapter for 52mm filters; if you're distraught over the infamous orbs of death, buy yourself a polarizing filter from Hoya. You'll love your sunny images when shot through one of the beautiful pieces of glass and it'll reduce the specular highlights and reflections from nonmetallic surfaces; an extra battery. The included battery is small in order to keep the camera from being bulky, but that's why most X10 owners are X10 owners. This entails a short battery life, so just buy another battery and carry it with a charger whenever you're out looking for the perfect shot.TIP: Shoot in RAW. Even if you claim to hate RAW or don't have Lightroom or Photoshop or any of the digital photo RAW processors, SHOOT RAW.

They are top candidates in the \"enthusiast\" compact category.Sony RX100Olympus XZ-2Canon G15Fuji X10Based on reviews and before I got my hands on any of these, I was sure Sony RX100 would beat out the rest. Price wasn't that much of a factor. At the end I went with Fuji X10. I simply love it, love it. And the main reason is that gorgeous Fuji color straight from jpeg. The color rendering is top-notch. Photos are realistic and when you look at it, there's certain magic that makes you feel you're right there inside the photo. A lot has to do with the pleasing Fuji color. What can I say, I'm now a convert for that \"Fuji Color\" people talk about so much. The other cameras produce nice photos but the color rendering can't match the Fuji, unless you want to shoot raw, convert, & post process. For jpeg, the Fuji really speaks to me.The other cameras within this group are all very very good as well. In fact if my top criteria is image quality at the pixel-level, Fuji X10 would not have been the winner. But these are small sensor compacts (one can argue wether or not Sony RX100 has \"small\" sensor) and I don't plan on blowing up the prints or looking critically at pixel-level. The Sony Rx100 definitely has the best image quality due to its bigger sensor. Fuji X10 can't match due to its smaller sensor but it's still very good. This is true at the wide-angle end. In the telephoto end, Sony RX100 loses its edge and I don't see the benefit of the bigger sensor compared to others in this group. In fact it's slightly worse because of the narrow aperture (F4.9 at 100mm). The other 3 cameras stay fast & wide even in the telephoto end.Also related to color rendering, the Fuji has the best auto white balance. This is very evident indoor under artificial lighting. The Sony Rx100 & Olympus XZ-2 would turn out very orangy and warm photos with auto wb. Canon G15 is good, and Fuji X10 turns out great looking, bright, & well-rendered indoor shots. Of course one can change the wb setting or even use custom wb. That would take away the shooting experience with extra steps and slow things down. Outdoor conditions, all these cameras do well with auto wb.This camera is a joy to use. I like the ergonomics and plethora of manual buttons for fast access to lots of shooting options. The viewfinder is ok, not great, because it gives no shooting info. But it's still useful under bright outdoor conditions. On the negative side, occasionally the auto focus would hang and not work. It turns out a few out of focus shots for no reason (others online also report this). All in all, it's just a great camera.

I was looking for a high quality, larger sensor, compact camera with a large, bright optical viewfinder that would feel comfortable in the hand and in a belt case. The X10 seems to provide everything I have wanted in an upgrade to my older Canon A540 compact camera. The A540 has done an amazing job for me over the years and I feel that the X10 will provide more potential for even better photos without losing the compact, ease of use features that I live by. Some specific things I like about the X10 is its perfect size and weight, the large clear optical glass viewfinder that is free of distracting data, the rotating zoom lens barrel that coordinates perfectly with the viewfinder, the large bright LCD screen, and the overall ergonomics. It is solidly built and user friendly. I feel that the X10 will meet all the challenges that I am presented with and will be a lot of fun at the same time.

Phd \"jpmath\"", "ReviewID": "R3FOBEM36N97NJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Admittedly, I haven't owned many, but I have seen a lot of images produced by myself & my acquaintances, typically with point-and-shoots, but also bridge cameras or super zooms. I've been using it for 9 months now, & this one produces the nicest results.The big attraction for me is the outstanding image quality. Fuji's unique EXR/DR technology is designed to increase dynamic range, and is very successful at it. (dpreview.com measures its dynamic range as equal, if not better, to cameras with much larger sensors, including DSLR's, ordinarily impossible.) So, if you use it right, images with lots of simultaneous bright & dark areas will look a lot better than in a lot of cameras whose sensor size should imply higher DR.The zoom isn't as much as many people may want, only 4x (28-112) but it's a fast lens (f/2 - f/2.8). Typically, getting a larger zoom implies a slower lens (such as the X-S1's f/2.8 - f/5.6, sacrificing depth of field and requiring high ISO to keep the shutter speed manageable) or a smaller sensor (sacrificing dynamic range & increasing noise at higher ISOs).This camera contains excellent image stabilization; handheld photos look great even with shutter speeds of 1/10sec.I much prefer viewfinders to LCDs, and this one has a nice optical viewfinder.The shutter is a leaf shutter, which is said to produce some very desirable images.The in-camera raw processor is a godsend if you're willing to work a little with raw files; if you forget to change some setting, you can adjust the image in the camera. I've found this useful when the camera gets the white balance wrong, which is actually quite rare. Fuji is well-regarded for its white balance & choice of color, and the camera provides some nice film simulations options for when you want something more vivid, etc.A lot of the usual features are here, though I use them rarely (panorama mode, pro low-light mode, miniature mode, toy camera mode, etc.).Some quirks/downsides: There's a learning curve. I'd recommend this only for people who know what they're doing in PASM modes, or are willing to learn. The manual isn't very helpful, barely explaining what the options are, but not much on when you might prefer one to the other. I learned a lot by visiting photography forums & looking at other people's photos on flickr.Higher DR implies a tradeoff, which comes in resolution; to maximize DR and minimize ISO, you have to work with 6MP images instead of the 12MP it is theoretically capable of. This isn't a problem for me, as I had a 1/2\" 16MP camera for a time, and was all too happy to give up the resolution in exchange for greater dynamic range. If you think this a problem, think carefully about how often you really need 16MP in an image. I've made attractive 8x10 prints from a 2MP image (subject matter helped... and no, it's probably not \"pro quality\" but most people find it a great photo) so unless you're planning on making mondo gondo wall-size prints, 6-8MP is more than enough.You can't use raw in EXR settings, which is where you trust Fuji's Engineers to choose the right settings. If they get it wrong, you can't fix it post facto. Fortunately, you can still used EXR/DR in the PASM modes if you shoot in 6MP mode, and still get raw files.The manual focus could stand to be a bit more responsive, and to give different options for how large to magnify the image. While Fuji released new firmware that offers focus peaking to other EXR cameras (HS50) and older cameras (X100) it mysteriously chose not to do so with the X10, much to my dismay.While the optical viewfinder is nice, it is useful only for framing the image. It provides no information on the settings or where it is focusing (for that you have to buy the X20, but then you sacrifice the dynamic range technology in the X10, though whether it's necessary with the X20's newer sensor is a good question). If you're running in silent mode, you won't know if you've focused in the wrong place, or if the camera fails to acquire focus. And, yes, the X10 sometimes has trouble focusing on something right in front of it.The leaf shutter means that the highest shutter speeds (faster than 1/1000sec) are unavailable at the largest apertures (f/2 - f/2.8, for example).It's a good idea to buy a spare battery, and charge one while the other's in use.

It has a beautiful analog design with great physical controls (manual zoom ring, dedicated exposure compensation dial, great optical viewfinder), along with great image quality from a fast f/2-2.8 zoom lens. What Fuji has basically done is taken the Fuji X design principles and shooting experience, and carried it over to a compact digital camera. Not an easy task given the size and cost limitations, but Fuji has absolutely succeeded.The JPEG rendering is wonderful (the Fuji black and white mode is especially nice), and the EXR sensor has a slew of additional capabilities for low light, high dynamic range, etc. The 4x zoom lens is both fast and sharp, and autofocus speed and accuracy are good for this class of camera. I'm not a fan of the typical 'pinhole' viewfinders on most compact cameras (when they have them at all), but have found the X10's glass optical finder to be very useful and actually a pleasure to use.The high dynamic range mode is a big selling point for this camera, as it does a great job of preserving highlights for outdoor photos, etc. The EXR modes will reduce resolution to 6 MP, but that is more than enough for small to medium prints (I think 8 x 10's would probably look great.)My review is based on the current firmware as of late 2013, and given current pricing (somewhere under or approaching $300) the X10 is in my opinion a great value today. Fuji has done a great job with firmware updates to many of their X cameras including this one, improving prior weaknesses such as autofocus speed. Many original X10 units also had a 'white orb' issue which produced unnatural artifacts from bright light sources, which was later fixed by Fuji with an updated sensor (something to be careful with if you buy a used unit.)", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Terry Lee Jones  I have been shooting pictures for over 40 years", "Author": "terry l jones", "ReviewID": "R1JQB2VJ03369C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great street camera  great for macro pictures vary compact  i love this little camera i also own a fujix100 & fuji xe1  have not been disapointed  the pictures are vary sharp color is super  i am a devoted fuji  photographer no regrets  the fuji x10 is my take along camera  these cameras are vary well built  I am a licence photographer  i do family photos  and  class photos street photos  and landscape  (TERRY LEE JONES  THE DREAMCATCHER  )  FUJI IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cute, fun camera", "Author": "Richard A.

NYTImes recently raved about the Sony hi end pocket camera, but the build quality seems better here.  A benefit I hadn't considered:  folks I shoot, even those who have no reason to fear, tighten up when a bazooka lensed DSLR is pointed at them.  A cute little camera doesn't seem to do this and I have gotten truly excellent relaxed, candid portraits using this camera that I doubt would have been possible with a pro camera.  Two drawbacks for me:  since the lens doesn't retract flush, this is not really a pocket camera.  Second, like any feature-heavy small camera, multiple functions accessed by a limited set of menus in a cramped space makes for confusion.

While the X20 enjoys a small resolution advantage in raw files, I found that its jpegs were not even close to the excellent quality jpegs produced by the X10.  For any of the advanced shooting options like \"pro-low-light\" (in particular), the X10 is my clear choice.On the other hand, since I usually shoot raw, the X20 was a wonderful camera, with a significantly improved viewfinder.Which one you get depends on your budget and your shooting preferences, and whether you can check the serial number of the X10, which had serious issues in earlier production. I'd look for X10's with serial numbers beginng 20XXXX or later. That is not an issue on the X20.Both models enjoy the same fast and sharp Fujinon lens and are simply a lot of fun to shoot with. If you need focus confirmation in the eye level finder, as well as shooting information, only the X20 gives you that. The X10 is a clear, bright finder with no shooting information covering (as in the X20) 85% of the covered view.  Anyone used to shooting with such a finder should have no problem. Parallax at close distances is, of course, an issue. Depending on how close one can depend on experience to know to orient the actual scene, or you can use the LCD on the back.The X10/X20 is by far my favorite small sensor point and shoot camera, producing fine images. The X10 jpegs are among the best out there, and using some of the advanced options, shooting up to 3200 for small enlargements (up to 8x10)  should be fine.

For some background, I am Nikon D7100 user and previous Nikon P7000 owner.  I find that I am using this camera more and more and reserve my D7100 when I want more creative control or for event photography.  This camera is remarkably portable and easily fits in my coat pocket. I take it everywhere I go.  It also has a very useful zoom range.  I am not sure why someone would want a mirrorless camera when you could have this one.  The photo quality is amazing and the colors are vibrant.  The JPEG\u2019s are great and I rarely need to make adjustments in post-processing. The macro feature is especially good and is reason alone to get this camera.  There is a super macro feature that takes incredibly close shots.  You could not take similar photos with a DSLR without a tripod and a special lens.  The build is very sturdy.  I like that it has a lens cap as it is easy to clean the lens. I also like the manual zoom as many of my previous point and shoots broke as the lens came off track.  I like the viewfinder and that you can turn the LCD screen off to save battery life.  The video quality is great.  It has advanced shooting modes that are quite useful.  The camera is not really designed for sports, but it does shoot 10 frames per second, so under the right circumstances it can come in handy.  It is great in low light but only at low shutter speeds, so don\u2019t expect to use this in low light if there is a lot of movement.  The pop of flash is great, provided that you are not to far a way and it makes a great fill flash during daytime.  In low light, use of the flash if you need to capture movement.  If taken with proper lighting it is hard for me distinguish the photos from this camera to the D7100.  I have not printed out anything large than 8X10, but they have all been tack sharp.  There is very little that I do not like about this camera, but there are a few things I wish they would change. 1) You can\u2019t view your photos without taking the lens cap off and turning the camera on. That is annoying. 2)  It has 41 focus points, and I can\u2019t figure out how to use that feature most of the time. 3) The RAW files are not supported by Apple\u2019s Aperture, but the JPEG\u2019s are excellent.  The exposure compensation button can be turned accidentally with noticing it.  I would prefer if it had a lock button on it.Overall, considering the size, image quality, features and zoom, I don\u2019t think that anything else on the market really comes close to this one.  I had a Nikon P7000 that was stolen, and this camera has much better image quality and features, so no comparison there.  I would say if you are a DSLR user who wants a portable camera that you can use any time and anywhere, this would be the one.  I don\u2019t think that you need to shell out an extra $200 for the X-20, but I haven\u2019t tried it.

I really like the Fuji X10 and that's coming from someone who owns a Nikon D7000 with a lot of lenses, a Fuji X100, and a Canon S90.  I'm not a professional, but I shoot pictures almost every day and have been an active photographer for 40 years.  I've taken about 700 shots with the X10.  I just grabbed a few shots at a New Year's party in dim light without flash using the EXR mode (high ISO low noise) and all of the shots look very good. They all are pictures that you really want to look at vs. lifeless snapshots.  Printed 8 1/2 x 11, they look very good indeed.  They have an almost classic Dutch Masters oil painting quality to the light and colors. The way Fuji handles light and color are amazing.  The Fuji X10 has produced some of the best pictures I've ever taken. Honestly, if you are a bad photographer, the best camera in the world won't produce good pictures for you - just stick with your cell phone. But, the Fuji X10 will be great for anyone interested in photography and it is small and light.  For the Fuji X10 to be the perfect camera for me it would need a bit faster autofocus, a larger sensor for the last word in resolution, an electronic viewfinder like the X100, interchangeable lenses, and an articulated screen.  I guess that will probably be the rumored next Fuji system camera.  However, the Fuji X10 is way better than a point and shoot.  Don't buy this camera for your grandmother, she will never figure it out.  All of the modes and options as well as the user interface are complicated.  But, if you or someone you know digs photography, they can really have fun with the Fuji X10 and produce stunning images.

It underexposed at least 3 steps but looked fine in the LCD view finder. When I brought it down to the local shop and did a reset on both and shot at the same settings it was obvious that something was wrong with the 1st one.Now I have a replacement and it is working as expected.So I purchased this to replace my favorite pocket camera my Canon G10. I wanted something with a optical viewfinder, RAW shooting, and a faster lens than the Canon's 3.5-5.6.The Fuji definitely fits the bill on paper. I also purchased the thread on lens hood so I could add filters (No ND built in is one major issue). I also purchased a thread on metal lens cap to protect the lens. My initial impression of the Fuji supplied one is it looks great but how long can the fabric felt that holds it tight to the camera body last? Also if i'm going to be fumbling with a lens cap anyway the flat thread on fits in my pocket better. Also I can attach the ND filters I ordered for it as well.RAW format was a problem until I upgraded to Lightroom 3.6 as it now supports the X10 RAW. Now if only photoaccute would come out with a lens profile for super resolution photos. Also there is no X10 lens correction profile in lightroom yet. Note to Lightroom, add this please.I have yet to fully understand when to use the EXR mode and when to simply meter well and bracket accordingly. I have shot with the camera meter and a Sekonic hand held spot meter and noticed that using the hand held meter required me to dial in about -2/3 on the exposure compensation dial to get good results. Will play with this more. The in-camera meter seems to work very well.I would have paid a extra $200.00 to get focus confirmation (with a focus target) in the viewfinder along with exposure data! I will keep posting as I use it more but the initial impressions are that this is a worthy if not quite perfect replacement for my G10.

Had it been researched a bit more intensively and kept simpler, it would have been a true, affordable Leica-killer. Which, sadly, is not the case with the X10. This product is plagued with so many flaws, you have to be a hardcore EXR fan to ignore them. So let's start...- White Disc Syndrome - in high contrast situations, i.e. Christmas lights, or - most commonly found - sun shining of a car's chrome, the light or light reflection is rendered as a white disc that is virtually impossible to correct even in post-processing. Basically it's a blob of pure white, of 255 value, where the information lacks altogether. Unless you're willing to manually 'paint' the area, the issue can't be fixed. (As of the date of this review, December 7 2011, Fujifilm hasn't come out with an official statement or fix of this problem.) I am a night / dusk shooter, so for me this issue was really big.- quirky autofocus. More often than not, the camera would simply not focus although there are indications of focus been achieved (green light by the viewfinder and focus beep if enabled.) A photo can be taken but it will be out of focus. One third of my images were like that.- useless manual focus. To achieve MF, one has to rotate the dial on the back of the camera. Aside from being counter-intuitive, it is really hard to get used to and a very slow process overall.- lack of focus confirmation inside the optical viewfinder. Basically all you get in the OVF is composition, which wouldn't be so bad if Fujifilm, in its infinite wisdom, would have at least provided a focus confirmation that does ONLY that. But as it is, the green LED by the OVF doubles as a power indicator, error indicator, low light indicator AND focus indicator with focus lock being its last priority. Suppose you shoot in aperture priority and there's not enough light - the LED will blink continuously, whether the focus was achieved or not. Sounds confusing? Well it is.- lack of a bulb mode. (WHY?)- shutter speed limitations. Yes you read this one right. While the maximum shutter time is 30 seconds, this is only happening at ISO 100. Once you crank up the ISO, the camera IQ will limit your shutter time shorter and shorter. Which is to say at ISO 800 you can't shoot 30 seconds because the camera won't let you. Simple as that...- strange parallax. what you see in the OVF is NOT what you get - you're missing a large chunk of your image, almost 1/4 of the bottom part. You'll have to aim upper through the OVF. Which would be fine if there were at least some marks on the viewfinder to remind you of it... but there are none. Most of the time, the composition will be off just because of this issue. Very strange, come to think that composition was the very reason they put an OVF on this camera.- dust inside the lens assembly. More than a handful of users have complained about this issue, whether it was seen right off the box or after only a couple of days of use. I haven't had this one personally but I saw it in other cameras. And it's scary, because there's no way the user can clean it.- 6MP vs. 12MP - turns out in EXR mode you can't use the whole 12MP the camera touts - don't expect to print that awesome low light shot too big, as your images will be only 6MP.- impossible user manual. The vast majority of tips and tricks are available online, from users and on forums, either because they're not in the book or because it's really hard to find them - putting together the X10's manual was a sloppy job at least.- and finally, VERY short battery life. I was able to squeeze about 100 frames out of it, and that was without flash.I wanted a simple camera to carry with me on a daily basis - you know, mostly for street shooting, and something smart enough to get me past the limitations of an iPhone. I was appealed by the OVF and the manual zoom, as well as the overall size - perfect for someone who carries bags most of the time, but doesn't want to drag the DSLR along. I loved the zoom as opposed to a prime, and I could have lived with the strange MF if need be. Not to mention that the X10 has a leaf shutter - which allows flash sync at any speed. How good is that... But alas, everything came to a screeching halt when I started using it, and the X10 was promptly returned only three days later. As I said in the title, the X10 is not there yet. If I were Fujifilm, I'd gut the damn thing and put inside a simpler IQ, a better sensor and battery, and I'd make damn sure the lens is dust-proof. As it is, it's beautiful on the outside but pretty much useless unless one has more money than (edited) actual photographic needs.To conclude, I wish the X10 joined the other cameras who put the bread on my table for the last 15 years. I'm hoping its next reincarnation will be able to do that.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm X10 - A Great Camera in almost every way.", "Author": "Richard", "ReviewID": "R2QL53BM3Q3N50", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Fujifilm X10 is a great little camera that is able to do so much.Here are the main positives:* Great build quality, feels like a little tank in your hands* Size is perfect for a carry around camera when you don't want to lug around a DSLR, but still want to take high quality pictures.  It will definitely fit in a jacket pocket or purse, but not in your jeans pocket.* Has lots of manual controls which allow the enthusiast, or even professional, to be creative.* The manual zoom offers precise control for framing pictures.* The custom rear display provides lots of options -  an electronic level, histogram, gridlines, shutter speed, aperture, distance to subject, etc.* The sensor is bigger than most point-and-shoots and the lens is super fast throughout the entire zoom range too.  This translates in the ability to keep the ISO at lower levels with resulting lower noise (and higher quality images) than other cameras with slower lenses and smaller sensors.* There are a few gimmicks like Pro-Low Light, EXR, and Pro-Focus that are actually quite good when used in the correct manner.* Shoots in RawA few negatives:* The viewfinder is not very helpful if you want to be precise in your framing when taking the picture; however, the rear display is more than adequate.* Manual focus is poor; however, auto focus is very good.* Battery life is so-so.

The Fujifilm X10 camera is, by far, THE most limited camera you can imagine.  If there are ANY bright lights in your image, you run this risk of having your picture ruined by WHITE DISC SYNDROME or ORBS.  Normal highlights are rendered by the X10 as sharp edged ORBS.  These look terrible and not at all natural.  NO other camera does this.  The reason for this problem is that the X10's sensor has a defective design.  Fujifilm has failed to design a sensor that can handle bright lights in a natural way.  I found dozens of ORBS the very first outing I had with this camera.  It is more than shocking to see so many of your images trashed by the cameras inability to handled basic scenes that 99.9% of the other cameras handle without a problem.  See for yourself.  Search for ORBS over at flickr and learn about how defective this camera is.  Make no mistake.  Many people here and else where deny that ORBS are a problem.  I believed them.  I bought the camera and found ORBS in my 3rd shot.  None of my other cameras have ever had a problem with ORBS.  But my X10 does and as a result is 100% totally unreliable.

They still deny to even seriously look into the AUTO DR (overexposure) and AUTO ISO + Flash (limit too low by 1 stop at 1600 and 3200) issues. Instead they asked me to return the X10 to my dealer for a refund.Dear Fujifilm team: Service is part of the package that customers pay for!-This is less of a review, but more of a summary of function complexities, quirks and issues that I encountered while using the X10. My current conclusion is that unfortunately there is no single best setting for all day shooting. It all depends on what you want, what you shoot and which of the following functions and issues are relevant to your shooting style.- L usually provides higher detail than M at all ISOs, but at ISO higher than 400 M size provides about 1 step worth of noise-reduction better luminance noise and overall less chroma blotching and white-noise shift.- EXR DR (where half the sensor is exposed shorter and later) is only used at ISO lower than DR (ISO 100 + DR 200, ISO 100-320 + DR 400). Maximum exposure time is limited to 1/4 second in M-anual mode then. In A-perture mode this leads to a bug with EXR DR when exposure time is chosen longer than 1/4 second by the camera, switch to ISO 400+ or turn off DR if you need that much exposure. EXR DR does not replace clipping whites of the longer exposed half with information of the shorter exposed half, but only attenuates the clipping white to gray and then blends both halves (seen as a grey halo with a thin outline in between around specular highlights).- HR DR (High Resolution) is used with ISO equal or higher than DR (i.e. ISO 400 + DR 400) and does not use the EXR capabilities of the sensor for DR. It can be used for both L and M images, but when combined with M then the X10 will use EXR SN pixel-binning in combination with DR. HR DR works by underexposing at lower ISO (amplification) and then pulling up shadows and mids via curves (at higher bit-rate RAW level before creating the JPG). It's the same as doing it manually via post-processing, but saves the extra work.- Regardless of DR setting maximum exposure time in all other modes than M and A is limited to 1/4 second, this can lead to underexposure if you reach the limits of aperture and ISO. The camera will show the red underexposure letters, but still refuse to use longer exposure time.- DR 400 provides higher dynamic range at all ISOs, but at the costs of less saturation in the deepest shadows and dark outlines around specular highlights (not just orbs). DR 200 can be a good compromise, but you have to choose the right setting for the right situation. EXR DR may increase the total dynamic range of the camera at ISO 100-200. HR DR does not increase the total dynamic-range of the camera, but it provides higher dynamic-range per ISO setting (dr normally decreases with higher ISO, so HR DR provides higher dr per ISO by internally using lower ISO before applying curves).- EXR DR cannot be combined with flash, only HR DR is available when the built in flash is used (and likely the same with external flash).- AUTO DR leads to overexposure (on my unit) even when all settings are the same as when you had set them manually. You cannot compensate this via -EV, because the overexposure only happens when AUTO DR chooses DR 200/400, not when it chooses DR 100. But the DR value chosen by AUTO DR is only visible _after_ you took the shot.- AUTO ISO can also lead to a very slight change of exposure (but minimal), can be both more or less exposure. In combination with AUTO DR this can lead to even more overexposure, though.- AUTO ISO (1600 and 3200) do not use their highest possible setting when the flash is used, even when this leads to underexposure. So AUTO ISO (1600) will max out at ISO 800, and AUTO ISO (3200) will max out at 1600.- \"+MOTION\" IS only works in combination with AUTO ISO. It will increase ISO when it detect motion or camera-shake, but will allow lower ISO compared to not using \"+MOTION\" IS when the frame is steady (aka the X10 chooses higher ISO than necessary when \"+MOTION\" IS is turned off).- AF-C may focus at a point slightly off center even when the cross-hair on aim and playback suggest the focus to be on the perfect center spot. This means that you may see a different focal plane on the image than what you aimed at even when the X10 confirmed to be in focus via green cross-hair. AF-S would rather report a failed AF in such a situation.- \"Spot\" metering always meters on the center and not on the AF spot. The manual describes this properly, but it's still confusingly named.- \"Face Detection\" automatically switches metering to \"Multi\", but in reality it meters and exposed on the detected face! Unfortunately the \"superintelligent\" flash does not measure on the face, which can lead to overflashed faces in some situation (especially if the face moved out of the center).- \"Tracking\" AF does not switch metering and the metering does not follow the tracked object (aka not like Face Detection).- \"Tracking\" AF works _better_ when power-saving is turned _off_. This is because power-saving not only dims the screen, but also reduces the refresh/frame-rate and seemingly this not only affects the output, but also the processing of on-screen information. According to the manual power-saving is turned off automatically for \"Face Detection\", but for \"Tracking\" it needs to be done manually.- Aiming at a frame with bright highlights inside the metering area (depending on current metering setting) leads to the aperture closing down during aiming to provide a better preview on screen. Once you (half)press the shutter the aperture performs an \"open-close-open\" sequence that takes some time and is not related to auto-focus. The wider your chosen aperture to be for the shot the longer this sequence takes. Using AUTO ISO also has some very slight impact on the lengths of the sequence.- Shooting \"RAW + JPG\" in M size at ISO at least double as high as DR leads to RAW file size being cut in half the size (does not happen with \"RAW\" only), from 18 mb to 10 mb. More important, this leads to SN pixel-binning happening inside the camera before RAW creation! The difference between pixel-binning inside the camera vs. inside the raw software is that the automatically applied curves to shadows and mids differ and thus the ranges/behavior to changes in the raw software is different (same value have vastly different outcome).- RAW Converter EX/Silkypix seems to mostly throw away the information of the longer exposed sensor half of EXR DR raws (not just clipped highlights, but everything)! What you will get is the same as if you had exposed the whole image later and shorter. If any motion was present during exposure then some of the motion related regions may show wrong/missing colors and kind of dithering artifacts. This seems to be different with different images. What it does effectively is to put priority on the shorter (and thus worse) exposed sensor half and then may or may not add in some information from the longer exposed half.-*-Some clarification on dynamic range and how dr \"expansion\" works on the X10 via the use of DR 200/400 modes (EXR DR vs. HR DR):According to DxO lab the X10 offers a maximum dr of 11.29 EV at ISO 100 and drops down to 8.15 EV at ISO 1600. This means that the higher the ISO the lower the dynamic-range.*EXR DR = half the sensor is exposed shorter and later*EXR DR is only usable for M sized images at ISO 100 + DR 200 or ISO 100-320 + DR 400, aka ISO value lower than DR value! All other combinations of ISO + DR use the other DR method called \"High Resolution\" (HR) DR. Additionally the maximum exposure time is limited to 1/4 second, likely to avoid motion artifacts that can appear because of the time-difference between the sensor halves (1/4 also seems to be the about limit of the image-stabilization's effectiveness).Theoretically using EXR DR 400 at ISO 100 should extend the dynamic-range of the X10 to around 13.3 EV. In practice I suspect that it is a bit lower than that, because at least in-camera clipped highlights are rather ungracefully blended instead of sophistical replaced with the other sensor half. Before the blending happens the underexposed half seems to have its mid-tones lifted to match the longer exposed one. And because half the sensor is underexposed and collect less photons you also lose some information in the deepest shadows, usually in form of some lost saturation, at least in JPGs.Once you use ISO 400 (9.8 EV dynamic range according to DxO) the theoretical dynamic range in combination with EXR DR would be around 11.8 EV. But usually you are using shorter exposure times with higher ISO or shot a lower light scene, so half the sensor would be even more underexposed and thus the practical gain would be nowhere higher than the original 11.3 EV that ISO 100 give at DR 100. No more benefit + possible drawbacks = makes no more sense to use EXR DR at ISO 400 and higher.Raw converter software is responsible for properly blending the two sensor halves and applying curves. This is what most software still fails at, including RAW Converter EX, Silkypix and Lightroom. Capture One currently seems to do it best, but lacks support for 12 mp DR 100 files in return. No software offers sophisticated control over the process.*High Resolution (HR) DR = full sensor exposing at lower amplification/ISO*HR DR has several benefits over EXR DR and doesn't need an EXR sensor at all (which is the reason why you find it in the X100, too). Internally it exposes the shot at 1 (DR 200) or 2 (DR 400) stops lower amplification to protect highlights and then applies curves to the higher bit-rate raw data before creating the final JPG. The total highlight protection of HR DR JPGs is about 2.5 EV, which likely is done by pulling highlights further down by 0.5 EV from the raw data that offers that much headroom.Again I doubt that 2 stops of dynamic-range are gained in practice, if any at all. That is because with higher ISO setting (amplification) usually comes shorter exposure (or less overall light). Instead you should think about this more as \"protecting\" highlights, instead of gaining range.The benefits of HR DR over EXR DR are:- Can be used with L sized images and can be combined with EXR SN pixel-binning with M sized images.- Exposes the whole sensor at the same time and thus avoids motion artifacts of EXR DR (which happen due to differently exposed halves with EXR DR).- Exposes the whole sensor for the full time and thus allows more photons to reach the AD converters. Interestingly HR DR still leads to loss of saturation in the lowest shadows of JPGs, just like EXR DR, so analog amplification seems to play a role, too.- Allows full maximum exposure time to be used (8 seconds at ISO 400) vs. 1/4 second maximum of EXR DR.- Is supported by all major raw converter software, even more so when pre-binned 10 mb raw files are used.The reason why HR DR is only usable at ISO equal or higher to DR is simple. In order to use 1 or 2 stops lower amplification/ISO you need to start at higher ISO. The sensor simply is not capable of using lower ISO than 100, so you need ISO 200 for DR 200 (=ISO 100) and ISO 400 for DR 400 (=ISO 100).And from my point-of-view: There is no \"hardware\" vs. \"software\". Both DR modes use hardware level exposure tricks (EXR uses shorter exposure time, HR uses lower ISO/amplification) and both modes seem to apply tone-curves afterwards. Only EXR DR is a \"true\" EXR sensor mode, but then HR DR allows to combine DR with EXR SN pixel-binning, too.There are different types of RAW files on the X10:- 12 mp size L with or without HR DR (RAW or RAW+JPG). It's the job of the RAW converter to demosaic the image to 4000x3000 pixels and apply tone-curves for HR DR (the camera just underexposes internally). Some converters throw away half the sensor information and only create an M size image (Capture One).- 12 mp size M with EXR DR (RAW+JPG). It's the job of the RAW converter to demosaic the image to 2816 x 2112, apply curves to the shorter exposed half and blend both halves. Silkypix/EX throws away most (sometimes all) of the longer exposed half information and mostly (sometimes only) creates an image out of the longer exposed half (not just highlights stuff). These files handle differently in each converter, some better (Capture One), some in between (Lightroom), some worse (Silkypix).- 12 mp size M with HR DR (RAW+JPG). It's the job of the RAW converter to demosaic the image to 2816 x 2112, apply curves for HR DR and pixel-bin both halves together for better SN.- 12 mp size M without HR DR (RAW+JPG). It's the job of the RAW converter to demosaic the image to 2816 x 2112 and pixel-bin both halves together for better SN.- 6 mp size M with HR DR (RAW+JPG, ISO 2x DR). The camera seems to do the pixel-binning and likely even curves! Some RAW converters cannot load these files at all (Capture One), those that can should all be able to handle them well. But as a consequence to the camera's pre-production these files react differently to RAW converters' controls (exposure, highlights etc) compared to 12 mp files. This means that the same RAW converter setting will have a different outcome.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Looking Camera, poor quality photos", "Author": "Joy L. Phelps", "ReviewID": "R2SX415XXA5AD3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Received this camera just a few days ago and I was really excited to see how good it would perform.  Sad to say that I was not very pleased with the end results.  I have been involved in photography professionally for over 20 years and I currently use the Pentax K-5 camera with about 4 different lenses. The Pentax K-5 is an excellent DSLR that gets the job done and you can be rough on it if need be.  But I got to thinking that I would like to have a smaller, take anywhere, camera with me that I would not have to change lenses, and has a good quality build to it that would also allow me to have a lot of control over its settings.Enter the Fujifilm X10.  A beauty of a camera that met really all that I required.  The reviews that you see, for the most part, have been very favorable, so without further delay I took the plunge and ordered one from Amazon and also bought the metal lens hood since it would give the capability to use 52mm filters as well.One of the first problems I noticed with it is that there were times when shooting with the lens fully extended it could not focus until after several tries or not at all.  That, to say the least, is pretty frustrating when you buy a compact camera that cost over $500 and it can't focus consistently in relatively good lighting conditions.  So that was not good for one, but then when I loaded up the pictures to better see the results I found the image quality to be the pits.  I have the camera set to its highest resolution and on the fine setting and it doesn't seem to matter whether I shoot in Raw or Jpeg, the pictures look out of focus slightly (yes, I upped the sharpening level), but then noticed how the pictures took on a washed out look as well.  There were very few that were acceptable.  I was very surprised.  I was shooting most of the shots at 1/60th of second or faster.  Tried other settings and modes and got basically the same results.Do I have a lemon?  Who knows, but without a doubt I will be returning this camera and look at some other options.  To be such a well made and attractive looking camera it is a shame it can't do what it was designed to do, and that's take good photos.  The Pentax Q sounds interesting, but it is even more expensive, has a slightly smaller sensor, and it is not a fixed zoom like the Fujifilm X10.  The Canon and Nikon choices don't exactly trip my trigger either.  A four-thirds would be a possibility, but they are a little larger too.  Well all I can say is that it is back to drawing board.

The specs are incredible and unlike Nikon & Canon may do, Fuji doesn't seem to dumb-down its non-dslr (profitable inter-changeable camera lens business) premium camera in a possible marketing move.  2.0 - 2.8, speed, build quality, fps, retro-ooks, Fuji color (mostly for the better), a decent viewfinder, and so on.  A camera that both a pro and an amateur can use (EXR, etc...).  But the many great capabilities of this camera have already been covered.Cons:My problem is primarily shoooting in low light and a few \"birthing\" quirks.  Professional reviews (S100 vs. X10 in one) verify an issue I've experienced of sometimes: weird camera choices.  For example, low light image ISOs are too high.  Even in bright sunlight, the X10 often prefers to choose ISO 400.  Worse, IS seems problemmatic.  Too much BLUR --- at least in my copy and in my hands.  It seems Fuji has always been a step behind at least Canon in this regard.  Strange given the camera's specs.  (More blur than my G11.)  I don't want to carry around a tripod at night!  Then, there is the white dot issue.  I don't expect this on a state-or-the-art just developed $600 rangefinder --- although it might be related to Fuji's attempt to push the envelope in terms of capabilities.  The manual could also be a bit better for me.It's too bad.  One global worry I have is the large number of returns apparently starting to occur (and concommitant growing number of sales on ebay) due to these problems and Fuji not yet coming out with firmware to fix the WDI issues in at least some of the X10s (that is, return windows closing on recent sales).  I trust Fuji and vendors will not rebox WDI cameras (some consumers may not even notice WDI --- at least at first) given the rebuilding of their camera business and image.  (Note: Check the tape carefully at the top of the camera and think twice before going for that open box --- and beware ebay offers)  Luckily, Fuji has, to my knowledge, a successful medical device business.12/06/2011I took a star away as Fuji has given me no help whatsoever and a Christmas light pic showed the now infamous yet denied white orb problem to great effect.

It will get you great shots in low light. Tha handy bracketing modes are a lot of fun. I have a canon 5d II. I still think I have more fun with this one. Its simple to get to and great for shots of my one year old. I used to use my IPHONE 4 for pictures of the kid. But he would never hold still enough and I would get bad camera shake indoors. The macro mode gets a lot of attention from people. I dont find myself using it to much in creative ways. I dont take pictures of flowers, bugs and toys. But, the marco mode is still fun to play with. Theis camera really shines on landscapes and night city scapes. I love the film simulation modes. The Film is not like the LOMO or Instgram effect you see on phones. But is gives you that film natural look that I love. If I want the LOMO effect Ill shoot with my Phone APP or my LOMO LC-A Film Camera if I want to get the \"REAL\" lomo look. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because sometimes I get a ever so slight struggle getting a focus esp. in manual and the video mode is good but there are better cameras for video. I didn't get it for video anyway. I shoot with my canon 5d II when I want to make short films or video projects. I read reviews with complaints about the menu settings. I dont have no trouble with the settings I figured it out first night I got it. There some small quirks to the menu. But they are easy to overcome.

When the problem was first discovered, Fuji said they would fix it with firmware.  So I gave them a pass on this one.

Fuji said it greatly minimized the White Orb problem...but look at dpreview or dcresource articles on the subject and see what they discovered...To me I could forgive having a problem with the sensor initially.  But I can't forgive stating you fixed the problem, when the White Orbs still are present and prominent.Keep in mind that the White Orbs will not appear at all in over 90% of your pictures.

The Fuji X10 has been one of mine--a minor one, but still a disappointment.  I give it 2-stars to be fair.  In truth, I hated this camera for my own personal use.  While it doesn't work for me at all, others may find it works for them.Looking at the specs, the camera appealed to me.  Reports of excellent image quality even at higher ISOs sounded great,  it has a bright and usable optical viewfinder, a fast and sharp manual zoom lens and all metal construction.  A bit expensive for a compact point and shoot but it sounded like it would be worth it since I'm a former Leica rangefinder user, I've been shooting pictures for around 40 years and worked as a photographer for half that time.  I recognize the value of good equipment although I no longer use it to make a living.  Unfortunately, the X10's strong points fell completely flat as soon as I got my hands on one (I had to order sight-unseen since there are no shops locally handling the camera).When I opened the box, I thought it was a nice little camera.  Emphasis on the \"little\" part.  First of all, I ordered the optional and overly expensive Fuji lens hood/filter adapter with the camera.  Once this hood was attached, I discovered I could not get my large-size thumb between the back of the hood and the camera body to turn the on/off and zoom ring.  At least once the lens is deployed, it's possible to use the zoom.  The bottom line on the lens hood is that it is a poor design and the fact that the lens needs an adapter to use a protective filter is another bad idea.Handling the camera was also frustrating.  I own several small digital cameras and all of them have the buttons and controls better placed.  I don't see the need for some of the buttons on the X10, some of them are out-of-reach for easy manipulation and some of them are too easy to push inadvertently.Navigation of the menus is a pain.  I know what I want to get to is in there somewhere but I have to go through too much to find it.  Maybe with more familiarization this would be easier.  But I would prefer to have quick access to the most useful controls and not have to scroll through dozens of options with suboptions and subsuboptions.  But Fuji doesn't have a monopoly on this.  As camera makers keep adding features they seem to me to be making the cameras less usable.Considering the lauded build quality, I was also disappointed.  The camera simply doesn't feel as solid as my older Canon G10.  The G10 handles better than the X10 as well (see above).  The optical viewfinder of the X10 is certainly better than the Canon.  I liked this feature a lot although the diopter adjustment was kind of limited.  I also liked that the viewfinder on the X10 is placed to the left side of the body like the Leica rangefinders I used to use.  The fact that a portion of the viewfinder is blocked by the lens and lens hood was not of any consequence to me.  The Canon G10 viewfinder, by comparison, is...well, no comparison.  I use the G10 viewfinder but I don't like it.  It's not bright or sharp and it doesn't show as much as the X10 viewfinder.As for the image quality...well, I never really got to make any real assessment here.  My normal working method with any digital camera is to shoot in RAW and use the converter supplied with the camera to process and convert the RAW to JPEG or TIFF.  I've proven to my own eyes that a RAW file, once processed, will give a better image than a JPEG right out of the camera.  Unfortunately, the RAW converter supplied with the Fuji X10 is just about useless.  I understand there are better RAW converter softwares available optionally but it should be an option, NOT a requirement.  The RAW converter supplied means the Fuji X10 is pretty much a JPEG only camera, in my opinion.The X10 does have a great performance in some areas.  AF is fast.  AF is accurate.  And shutter lag is virtually nonexistent.  The Fuji AF and shutter beats the socks off my old G10 as well as my Olympus E-P1.  The lens is another great feature.  From what I could tell, it performs beautifully.  Fuji has been making high quality lenses for decades.  I used a couple of large format Fujinons on 4x5 field cameras many years ago and found them to be outstanding.  I also like the higher speeds.  I wish all the makers of higher end compacts would employ zooms with wider maximum apertures.  Wider angles would also be nice.From a purely personal standpoint I really hated this camera.  I hated it because it should have been better than it actually is.  It promised being a well-made, versatile camera with excellent imaging.  But for me, it was frustrating and impossible to use.  I can't say it's a bad camera because it's not.  The ergonomics that didn't work for me might be of no concern to someone else.  The wretched RAW converter that comes with the camera might not be an issue for those who routinely use other software.  If you only shoot JPEGs, it's certainly no issue.In 40 years of shooting photos I can't remember ever returning any camera, lens or other piece of photo gear unless it was defective.

Takes FOREVER to focus, and is really difficult to understand which way to turn the thing. there's no indication you're going the right way.2. Exposure: on all of the auto settings, it's constantly metering light differently. Move the camera slightly and you get a totally different meter reading. The exposure shoots up and gets really bright even though your'e pointing it right at your subject and not pointing it into the dark or anything. So many pictures come out way overexposed.

I liked the fit and finish of the camera, but ended up returning it because sometimes it simply wouldn't take a picture when I turned it on.  This happened enough to be maddening and resulted in multiple missed \"pic of the trip\"  situations.  Frustratingly common in occurrence, but not enough to identify a cause, and of course when I took it into the camera store it didn't repeat the error on demand.  I ended up returning it, and got a Canon, which doesn't have the cool twist to turn on feature, but also turns on when you press the button...every time.Other annoying features:1.  Crap lens cap, you have to take it off each time and put it in your pocket, then take the picture.  This extra step results in delay and annoyance, and prevents it from being a fast street shooter.2.  Doesn't fit in a pocket, the lens sticks out about 1.5 inches from the body.  If you are traveling you are stuck showing everybody your expensive camera that says steal me...all the time or carry a bag.3.  Slow focusing and power up and shoot time for snap shots.My conclusion, looks cool and takes great pics when it works, but you if you get a clunker like the ones I used it will not work at all the wrong times.  BTW I tried out two different ones that had the same problem...anyone else encounter this issue?

A quarter of the size advertised. When asked about this, it took them days to get back to me, and their response was simply to call them. They would not answer my question by email. Which tells me that they plan to lie to me, and don't want it in writing.I had another question for their technical support, and I never heard back from them at all. They must subscribe to the idea that sales is customer service, and once they have your money, you are on your own. Also, on a minor point, the battery charger that comes with this not-inexpensive little camera is very cheap. It is the type that the prongs for plugging it into an outlet fold out from the charger. It has no chord, and so it cannot be used on an empty slot in a power strip. It must be used where there is sufficient room around the outlet for the entire charger to go flush against it.So, I guess, including the lack of support, that is three things. One really major one, one kind of middling one, and a minor one that I am unhappy about. Mostly I would like to know how they feel it is okay to claim that this 3MP camera is a 12MP camera. This is not a subjective or variable measure that can be fudged to ideal circumstances. This is a fixed value that they are simply, bald-faced lying about.  :(************* after more time **********Despite the above mentioned stuff, I truly love this camera. The interface is SO much nicer to use than my Nikon D5000 and D40 that I find myself wishing for a DSLR version of this camera. But there is one new thing I just discovered that is really annoying me. It has no \"bulb\" setting! I have owned quite a few cameras, in the last three decades. And this is the first one with any manual controls that does not have a bulb setting. I love that I can screw in  my old, manual cable release to the shutter release button, but I cannot take the star-track photo that I want because the absolute maximum exposure this camera will allow is thirty seconds. Why on earth would they leave off the bulb setting? I sure hope they make a software fix for this. I can't imagine it would be all that hard to do. Maybe it would? Still... very annoying and disappointing that they arbitrarily decided we do not need the \"bulb\" setting.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beware - necessary software does NOT work with MAC!", "Author": "rpro", "ReviewID": "R2RWAS62GW2H8U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My normal camera is a Nikon D300. Thought this would be good for casual photos but better than my iPhone 4s. While there are good qualities to this camera like the build/material and a nice lens, the flaws and missing features are serious. If you want a filter you MUST add the hood and adapter. They make the camera's metal lens cap useless/unusable. There is no way to cover the lens!! That's a huge problem. In case you wondered the lcd screen does not tilt or swivel and it is not a touch screen. These features are getting pretty standard for other cameras like this so consider not being able to touch the focus point that you want. It also means that if you are trying to use this camera in the dark you won't be able to see where buttons/dials/controls are. On a small camera with very small/crowded buttons that becomes challenging.The menu structure is convoluted/confusing. Autofocus seems to hunt a great deal. There is a major flaw (bolb) in images that have a bright spot (Fuji has acknowledged but there's no fix). The connector port to the computer is not standard on the camera side (it's not mini or micro usb). You can't turn on the camera without turning the lens - and that requires removing the lens cap. The movie sound is terrible and shooting a movie (you'll hear the zoom movement/friction in every video!) requires turning a mechanical dial (not the press of a button) so it's not quick or easy switching by using a small, top-mounted dial, and this obviously requires two hands, like many other controls.MAC users beware - the mac software is old and won't run on osx 10.7.2 !!! Fuji acknowledges this but offers no solution. How on earth are we supposed to convert their version (not standard) of RAW files or connect for firmware updates thru finepix - the only way!!I really wanted to like this but way too many issues.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not what I was looking for", "Author": "Norma Lee \"nllatplay\"", "ReviewID": "RSYSXI7Z3HCCH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera was too big and heavy for me -- I was looking for a small point and shoot.
