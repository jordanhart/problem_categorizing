{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Powerful Point and Shoot, but Some Flaws", "Author": "Joseph \"jck09\"", "ReviewID": "R3TSY8JZ7YI5QD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Summary: This is a powerful camera.  15x optical zoom, a 28mm lens, and 14.4 megapixel shots are great specs for the price.  On the other hand, the interface is cumbersome, and after a few weeks, my pictures still don't look as good as I would hope.What's good:- As I said, the specs are great.  I particularly appreciate the huge optical zoom, which is the biggest thing that has me using this camera at special occasions instead of just using my iphone.  Previously, I had used Canon point and shoots with 3x optical zoom, but 15x really lets you get shots.- The interface is powerful.  You can leave this in automatic mode and let the camera decide the best settings, or you can use \"scene\" mode with a variety of preset choices, ranging from sport (quick shots to reduce blur on moving subjects), portrait, and even separate templates for taking pictures of dogs or cats.  There is also a manual mode where you can set just about everything yourself.  There are a variety of extras, including a \"face beautifier\" mode that automatically lightens faces and increases eye size.(!)- I like that there is a pop-up flash with its own switch.  That way, I can tell if the flash is on without messing with a lot of menus.- Movie mode seems fine, with the ability to zoom in and out during a movie and the ability to take hd video.- I like that the camera has a built in lens cover - when you turn it off, a plastic aperture closes to keep dust off your lens.  (But see below -- the lens cover isn't that sturdy, so IMHO you need a camera bag regardless.)What could be better:- Unfortunately, the automatic lens cover is not as sturdy as I would prefer.  I put this camera in my pants pocket, and managed to jam the cover halfway open.  I was able to get it to close again, but in the mean time, the lens had smudged pretty thoroughly, requiring about five minutes work with a microfiber cloth to repair.  I recommend getting a camera bag for this, rather than just throwing it in a purse, backpack or pocket.- The interface is cumbersome, with wheels, buttons, on screen choices, etc.  That may be necessary for a camera with as many options as this, but if you are not willing to spend a day or so reading the manual and trying this out, you will definitely not get the most from this camera.- Automatic mode has let me down consistently.  It's mostly blurry shots (either from moving people in my picture or not holding steady on zoom) or the camera choosing the wrong subject for focus, but I generally won't use this camera in auto mode.- Scene mode is kind of a pain.  Every time you turn the camera on in scene mode, it asks you to confirm your choice.  IMHO, if I took the last picture in sport mode, I want to take the NEXT picture in sport mode, unless I tell the camera differently.  Last weekend, I was taking pictures of my kids at the ice rink, but every time I turned the camera off and back on again, I lost two seconds confirming that I still wanted sport mode pictures.  Maybe there's a menu choice someplace to turn this off, but I haven't found it, and even if so, it's a goofy choice for the default setting.- I can't tell whether it's possible to buy a backup battery from someone other than GE.  The battery is an 880 mah li-ion battery, GE part number GB-50A.  It charges by plugging the whole camera into a USB port and takes a while to charge.  With only one (apparently proprietary) battery and no backup, there's definitely a risk that on a flash heavy day, you will find yourself stuck mid-day.  The battery is nice and compact, but if the camera took commercially available batteries, then it would be easier to have a backup or to buy one in an emergency.- As with most of these devices, you will need to buy memory separately if you want to take more than a few photos.  It takes a standard SD card.  It's typical not to include one, but they're so cheap these days that it would be nice to throw in an 8 GB card just to get started.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Review: GE (General Imaging) G100-BK", "Author": "H. J. Spivack", "ReviewID": "R27SHGHDJ7EBJ1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before I get into the review, allow me to suggest that this camera isn't terrible but its name is.  Too unwieldy, the only way to easily identify it from its peers is by model number and picture.  That's not branding, that lack of branding.The camera itself is pretty good.  First, it doesn't feel like a toy in your hand though it isn't particularly large. I have other cameras that are the same size, but the weight and feel of this one is more substantial.  Second, the lensing system, which is usually the downfall of many inexpensive cameras (even those with big ole megapixel counts) is pretty good.  When zooming, I won't ever decide to use the digital zoom, opting instead for the mechanical optics zooming which maintains pixel integrity.The camera is pretty simple.  It comes in its box with a strap (which has two side though there's only one thru-put on the camera itself, cables (a plug for charging through a USB plugin), a cd and manuals.  It does not come with a memory stick, which you need before you can take any pictures.  There is no discernible internal memory so if you order this camera, go buy a memory stick before it comes.The pictures, at first, were quite blurry.  The painted icons on the camera are tiny (hard to read) but working through them takes no time.  With at least moderate facility with a camera, you'll find some of the cool little tricks.Instead of simple shutter and aperature, the G100 includes templates, around two dozen of them.  One template is for taking pictures of your dog.  Another is of your cat.  Each changes multiple variable on the camera and each seems to work pretty well.  I took pictures of dog, cat, wife, son both in and outside and all came out looking great.  That's not to say you can't adjust the aperature and shutter speeds.  You can, but you may find it easier not to.The only drawbacks to the camera seem to be these:*It took forever to charge the camera to greenlight.  Doesn't sound like a big deal but the battery meter showed it being nearly full when I put the battery in*Little bit of a learning curve to get around the menuing interface.*The lensing system is substantial but appears to be plastic.  I'm wondering how it will hold up to everyday use*the flash looks a little underpowered, but then again, that's what they say about me too.All in all, a solid little camera, one that I will use happily for years.  I'm guessing the next megapixel count that I buy will be in three figures.  If you are considering purchasing, I believe you'll like what you buy.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Two half-star flaws", "Author": "My Fake Name", "ReviewID": "R3IKFZDW5ACRS6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "****The Power PRO Series is the top of the line of the cameras General Electric (GE) offers through its arm General Imaging, and the G100 is the top of that line.The General Imaging Full-HD Digital Camera with 14.4MP, CMOS, 15X Optical Zoom, 28mm Wide Angle Lens, 3-Inch LCD and HDMI can capture 14 megapixels in a single photo, which is more density of information than most people need or want.  You can dial it down in size and quality in these increments: 14, 12, 10, 8, 5, 3, 2, and VGA.  You can also control something called \"Quality,\" which is not explained, to Best, Fine or Normal.  The extremes, then, are 14 megapixels at best quality and VGA at normal quality.You can fit this little camera, which also records video with audio (but see below), into the back pocket of your jeans but you probably shouldn't.It offers simple point-and-shoot options with variations.  The most interesting choice is Auto Scene (ASCN), which analyzes the various elements presented to the camera lens and decides which of a couple dozen particular settings of flash and aperture and speed -- beach, glass, portrait, dog, cat (no kidding) -- is best.  As you move the lens from place to place or the elements otherwise change you can watch how the ASCN setting tries to predict what you want to do.  For example, if you move the lens close enough to a surface, the camera in ASCN mode will switch to its macro settings.  It's not always right, but it's a good starting poiint.Not surprisingly, the microphones -- in the front at the bottom, the left being separated by 2-1/16 inches from the right -- do not do a good job of recording anything far away.  The G100 does not offer a mic input, so whatever audio you get into your video will have to come from pretty close up and with the camera pointed at the maker of the noise.  If you mistakenly cover one or both microphones, needless to say that input's gain will drop to pretty much zero.The lens elements work out to a zoom of 15X, and at that level you need to hold the camera pretty darned steady to get a crisp photo.  The zoom from 15X out is digital, and even at the full 90X you can get a decent shot.  The jpg file I've added to this product's description page is simply a photo taken by the camera under review at 90X magnification.  I think it would be legible at half again that distance, don't you?  Needless to say, I used a tripod.****SD CARDYou will immediately want to acquire and insert a Secure Digital (SD) card into the camera, because its internal memory is only 15 megabytes, which you'll burn up in no time.  The G100 allows SD cards ranging in capacity from 64 megabytes up to 128 gigabytes.  Unless you have one lying around anyway, anything smaller than 2 gigabytes is probably not a good idea, just in case you want to record more than you expected and you would run out of room.  A good example is when you realize you're looking at alien spacecraft in the sky and you fire up your GE G100 camera and set it to Movie mode and start shooting and the aliens do something really weird just AFTER your camera runs out of storage space.  The larger is your SD card the less likely this is to happen.The significant points in the SD card range are 1-gig, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128.  64-gig SD cards are so large that you're unlikely to use up that much space unless you're a professional photographer, in which case you certainly won't be using this camera, because it is much closer to the point-and-shoot end of the range than the full-on, interchangeable-lens, DSLR end of the range.  128-gig SD cards are twice as unnecessarily large and crazy expensive.  According to my skew on Moore's Law, though, SD space per dollar will double in 18 months, so if you can make do for a while with a smaller size than you'd like, maybe the price for the size you really want will come down.Considering the pricing of SD cards per byte and how much space a single 14 megapixel photo can use up, my recommendation is that you shop around for at least an 8-gig card.  Note that SD cards are rated not only by size but also by a Class number, typically 4, 6, and 10.  Class 10s are faster to read and write than Class 4s, which affects how fast the camera can take the next shot.  I stumbled into a bargain and got a no-name 32-gig Class 10 SD card for $22.  An example search term if you want to shop on Amazon is \"32g SDHC Class 10.\"The HC part of SDHC I threw in there means high capacity.  Confusingly, SD cards are also classified by the last two letters of their name, their being SDSC, SDHC, and SDXC.  SDSC means standard capacity and is used for cards up to 2 gigabytes.  SDHC means high capacity and is typically used for SD cards from 4 up to 32 gigabytes.  SDXC means extended capacity and includes SD cards from 64 gigabytes up to an astonishing 2 terabytes.  The G100 camera, as stated, will accept SD cards up to 128 gigabytes.With minimum-quality settings, which would be appropriate for, say, text messages, a simple photo generated by this camera used only 40 kilobytes whereas the highest-quality settings for that same simple photo used up 10,785% more, or around 4,354 kilobytes.I know you're wondering about how many low-quality images could be stored on one of those 2-terabyte SD cards of the future, and the equation is simply this:2 terabytes divided by 40 kilobytesNow, I'd like to impress you with all the mathematical gyrations one could go through to arrive at the answer, as I have been known to try to do in certain Amazon reviews, but the truth is I simply entered the exact text above into Google and it gave me the answer.  Using the lowest-quality settings on this camera, you wouldn't fill an 2-terabyte SDXC card till you'd shot over 53 million pictures.How many is 53 million pictures?  If someone hires you on January 1, 2013, to shoot that many images at an average rate of one every five seconds for a solid eight hours a day, five days a week, 50 weeks a year, that's 2,000 hours, which is 7,200,000 seconds, which divided by 5 seconds per picture is 1,440,000 pictures per year.  53 million pictures divided by 1,440,000 pictures per year means you can expect to remain on the payroll till sometime in September of the year 2049.  You can't expect a lot of career advancement, but it's steady work.JSYK, the designations SDSC, SDHC, and SDXC refer mainly to which devices can READ them, not which devices can WRITE to them.  Some older devices that can read an SDSC card (up to 2 gigabytes) cannot read an SDHC card (up to 32 gigabytes).  Many devices cannot yet read SDXC cards.  One option if you're running out of room on any given SD card you choose to use in the camera is simply to copy some or all of the images that are on there, using the supplied and very short (only 24 inches) USB cable, to somewhere else such as a flash drive or a hard drive, which also eliminates the problem of no forward compatibility, because the camera's \"reader\" is always going to be compatible, of course.****User ManualThe manual, which you can find online as a PDF at the maker's site, is imperfect.  For instance, under the Camera Notes part of the Safety Precautions section it says:\"Do not store or use the camera in the following types of locations: In rain . . . or in a place where the camera can be exposed directly to sunlight.\"These safety precautions go overboard in both directions.  To port they tell us not to use the camera where it can be exposed directly to sunlight, which is silly.  There's even a specific setting for taking pictures on the beach.  To starboard they tell us not to store the camera in the rain.  Sheesh.  Why not tell us not to set it on fire or run over it with a steamroller or shoot it with a .22 rifle from ten yards away?As another example, the diagram of the camera showing the top stupidly shows it as though you had spun it around so the lens is facing you, which is the opposite of what you would expect.  Someone screwed up at General Imaging and no one caught it.More notesHere's a quote from the User Manual: \"Note that when you perform the Format Memory function, it only formats the active memory.  If an SD memory card is inserted, the SD memory card is active and will be formatted.  If there is no SD memory card, the internal memory is active and the internal memory will be formatted.  Formatting the SD memory card will not automatically format the internal memory.\"This is just lazy coding.  The software surely could have been written so that the user can make the choice whether to format the internal memory or the SD card or both, for which I subtract half a star.  If you had irreplaceable photos on your 15 megabytes of internal memory and they got irretrievably erased because you didn't foresee this unexpected result, you'd be just as eager to sue GE as I am because you mistakenly deleted the photos proving indisputably 100% beyond any possible doubt whatsoever that the Loch Ness Monster and yetis exist.  And aliens.And of course ghosts.  They're everywhere.The battery does not last as long as I expected.  If you're planning to rely on this camera for possibly critical photos and video, you might want to carry a spare battery, which you should also not store in the rain, I'm sure.You can change focus during a movie recording, but you can't be sure the sound of the motor and the sound of the lens elements changing will be inaudible.  Sometimes there is an obvious clicking noise on playback that results from use of the zoom control ring that surrounds the Go button.  For this I subtract another half a star.There is a disappointingly long lag between when you press the shutter button all the way down and when the picture is taken.  At long shutter speeds you would expect that, but it happens too much at too short exposure times.And here's an interesting discovery.  This camera will not take a photograph of Dick Cheney.  Twice I shot him at a press conference with the G100 and both times all I got was a message saying, \"Contents controlled.  Go to CIA.org.\"I find this to be a remarkably sophisticated camera for the price asked, but it is flod.****", "Date": "May 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice lower cost point and shoot.", "Author": "M. A. Mitchell", "ReviewID": "R3TZYGQBKNF4KS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the weight and feel of the camera body.  You can hold the camera comfortably with out blocking the flash or focus assist light.  The flash has a manual release which is convenient.  The battery door is spring loaded and automatically opens when the release is activated.  Button and control placement is typical.  The back display screen is moderately bright and clear.  The display shows enough information about the current operating mode and picture settings to be useful.  Menu items are simple to understand and cover the basics.  Various filters and operating modes are available to assist in picture taking process.  A basic point and shoot model.Operating the camera is like most point and shoot models.  It allows for fully auto mode, custom scene shots, semi manual modes and a manual mode.The camera tries for a lower ISO settings and longer shutter times in auto and semi auto modes.  This can lead to blurry photos in lower light situations.  The camera does however indicate it needs a flash for the picture when shutter times are long. (The camera will flash the lightning bolt on the screen after focus is achieved if flash is not enabled)  If you do not manually pop the flash up then the camera must remain very still.  When the flash is enabled the camera seems to wait for flash to charge before it will focus or take a picture.I find the (P)rogram mode may be the most reliable for indoor shooting without flash since the auto mode appears to have a limit of 1/4 shutter speed.Focus lengths are a bit long for the zoom range available and the contrast focus method may take up to 1.5 second to focus on some subjects.  Flash range is modest but useable.  Pictures are as expected for this class of camera with regards to lense quality and image noise at ISO levels above 400.Owners manual is basic and may not be enough for novice users to understand the options and their results.I believe the OEM battery is the same as a Li-50B.  I have ordered a couple and will verify.Overall camera will produce good photos consistent with a low cost point and shoot.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice camera", "Author": "Rick \"SargD\"", "ReviewID": "RP0XBOZ6Z631Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice camera for the price.

All in all with the available shooting modes and the fact that the CMOS sensor produces outstanding results this camera is well above basic point and shoot varieties as it is considered to be a bridge camera.After thorough testing and battery life being between 170 to 200 shots I can highly recommend the General Imageing brand and especially the GE G100 as it is sturdy and a powerfull 15x zoom which is usually found on higher priced cameras is an added bonus.Quality of photos taken with the G100 rivals and in some cases is better than some higher priced brands.

The battery situation, poor low light and flash, and need to process the pics keeps it from being a 4 star rating.

Slow & blurry", "Author": "Ninjaba \"Ninjaba\"", "ReviewID": "R3TWZ8TU3D72WH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've owned quite a few digital cameras over the years, mainly the Canon PowerShot Series. The last time I upgraded was to a Canon PowerShot SD780IS 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.5-inch LCD (Black) in 2010, which promptly died after less than 6 months. So I've stuck with my Canon Powershot A610 5MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom, which has been dropped so often it's a wonder it works, but it does! Not sure GE's camera could withstand the same abuse.Firstly, if this was a camera I had to buy I wouldn't. It's a GE. I didn't even know GE made cameras. As it is, this was a free product I received to test and right out of the box I was quite impressed. The look and feel is very nice for a multiuse camera. It's much smaller and lighter than my A610, very standard in appeal, and what you expect from a simple small on-the-go camera these days.Pro:- Set-up was easy. Right when I turned the camera on it opened to my settings display and I could set the date and time.- Thankfully the battery was already partially charged.- Like that it has its own battery and I don't need to provide AA batteries; as is pretty standard on most cameras these days.- Nice large digital display screen.- Flash is easy to access.- Great zoom.- Basic settings - macro, micro imaging.- A variety of scene modes! More than I've ever had on a camera before. Not sure I'll use all of the options.- Jog dial to scroll through settings and pictures.- Can sort your pictures into little files on your camera. I used this to sort by date so I didn't have to look at every picture to get to the older ones I took days ago.- Rapid fire, or continuous capture, is impressive. I have children so I always keep my cameras on rapid fire so I don't miss anything.- Has an Exposure Compensation button! Thank you!!Cons (and there are many):- Settings: I prefer not to see the time in 24-hour (military time), but there isn't an option for this. Minor, but still would like the option.- Turning the camera on there is a few seconds delay. This is frustrating. I have children. When they do something cute I want to turn the camera on and take their picture immediately: I don't want to wait and admire the GE Imagination at Work logo. At first we thought the logo was giving time for the lens to open, but the lens opens faster than the logo disappears. My A610 turns on and is ready to go.- The display after you take a picture is about 3-4 seconds. This is majorly annoying that doesn't work well with kids. I want to be able to take multiple pictures and not have to wait. This is why leaving the camera on continuous capture is helpful (the display screen changes quickly). If there is a way to change the display time I haven't found it, which leads me to the manual.- The manual is sparse. The accompanying User Manual CD is the same thing as the paper manual, which is only 31 small pages. Normally I don't read manuals, but I felt I had to with this camera because I couldn't figure out some basic features; it's not very intuitive.- Flash takes awhile to go off, or else takes a bit to power up and then works a little quicker the second time.- All of the buttons are small, so if you have larger hands you might find it a bit difficult to navigate. The power button itself is about a third the size of a pencil eraser.- Manual settings are limited.- Battery takes awhile to fully charge. I fully charged the camera, but after less than a day of use it already showed 1/3 battery life.- Being able to toggle through the scene modes - such that you want to put it in Sport mode so the pictures won't blur - delays your picture taking. First, there's no preset button for this on the main wheel. You have to turn the dial wheel to SCN then scroll through to get to Sport. There should be another menu set for this, so you can preset the scene mode to be ready whenever you turn on the camera. Otherwise every time you turn on the camera you have to look at the scene mode options again (already selecting the last mode you selected - kind of redundant) and reselect it before the camera is ready to take another picture. The way to get around this is to just leave the camera on ALL the time.- Picture quality... okay, this is an inaccurate statement: \"Automatically adjusts for unintentional camera movements, giving you clear, crisp pictures every time.\"  In auto mode I have a lot of blurred pictures unless my kids are sitting still. You can't tell me I have to set the camera in Action Mode every time (see above for the delay that would allow for); I never know when they're going to take off and run. Very disappointed with the number of blurry pictures I got. My A610 didn't have this problem, granted they weren't as crisp and bright (not being digital and only 5 MP), but they didn't blur as often as this camera. Also, taking pictures on a clear crisp day at the pool I got pictures that looked like it was a cloudy day!- Video quality... I about threw up. The camera constantly refocuses and is shaky. I feel like I just needed to set the camera on a tripod and tell my kids not to move so quickly (they are 3 and 1).Overall this is a very disappointing camera. I don't want to use it with my kids because I'll most likely miss something they did. I was expecting a camera like this to be more adaptable and easy to use for general everyday use like taking pictures of our kids. To be fair, it probably is a good camera for general recreational \"I want to snap a picture of pretty tree\" pictures, but it doesn't work for me and my family. I will play with it a little more, but I'm not giving it much hope. If I find something that helps (or if you have something to offer) I'll add an update, but as for now, I can't give it a good review and sadly, because I *really* wanted to like this camera, I'll go back to my A610.RATINGS NOTE: I wanted to explain the main reasons why I gave this camera a 2 star rating. A camera should take a good picture, or else a reasonable one. I had so many that were blurry in auto mode, and the video kept refocusing it made me sick. AND, the camera is slow with the display and to start. If I want to adjust for blurry pictures and put it in sport mode (for example) it delays my start time (and still makes for blurry pictures). These were my main reasons. The camera does take good stationary pictures on par with my A610. The best pictures I got were from macro still shots - they were really beautiful. But even pictures of the kids, using a flash inside the house, just sitting there playing, the quality was off; overexposed with a little blur line, haze, and out of focus when the camera gave me the green display. I shouldn't have to make a lot of personalized selections to get a basic shot. All of these things are unacceptable to me for moments I can never get back.UPDATE: I have since downgraded my rating to one star. I am so furious with this camera; it has ruined so many simple shots. All of my pictures have hazes and blur spots. This camera should not be sold. As it is I have boxed it back up and am no longer using it. For the money there are so MANY cameras that are far superior on the market. Stay away from this one you will be disapointed.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing power for amazingly low cost", "Author": "Howard Evans", "ReviewID": "R2AWNAHRH4TNFR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't explored a lot of the settings and bells and whistles, but it does what I wanted - takes great pictures with high resolution.

Its functions do include \"automatic\" pictures as well as a number of scenes which are meant to take pictures of anything in environments of bright sunlight to dim interiors and action shots. The zoom capability is also great - you can zoom in very far without losing the quality of the photo at all. The camera also offers fantastic red eye reduction, which is a must in my house as my daughter's blue eyes always cause problems in photos.Physically, the camera feels substantial, and has a neck strap for ease of use and carrying the camera around. The flash pops up when it's ready to go and the dials are all easy to use and access. I've taken numerous pictures with the camera, particularly in the faster moving modes because I have pets which aren't too keen on sitting still just for me to take their pictures, and I've been very satisfied with the quality and appearance of all the pictures so far.In addition, the software that comes with the camera is surprisingly easy to use, which I felt warranted a mention. Some cameras have really clunky, slow software that does little but import the photos. This software is a bit speedier and has a number of other functions, include adding backgrounds to your photos, great for making keepsakes or letting children play around with their own photos.This is a solid little camera and I would definitely recommend it to others.", "Date": "May 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quirky, but a good camera for an amateur", "Author": "Harkius \"harkius\"", "ReviewID": "R1AALZ2QAOR3D3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Confession time. I am not a professional photographer. Those of you who hate amateur reviews, and downvote them, go crazy.The rest of you, I'll assume, are willing to read a review from someone who doesn't know, or especially care, what F-Stop is.This camera is as good as any digital camera I've had (non-DSLR cameras), at being a standard point-and-shoot beast. When you want to do more than that, it can probably do some of those things, too. For example, I've played around with the different scene settings and noticed that it seems to be something akin to a built in instagram function. I'm not sure what it's doing differently between the different modes, but it's certainly doing SOMETHING different. Sometimes the light is much brighter, sometimes much darker. It's the kind of thing that you'd need to play with a while to get really comfortable using.I've had this thing for a while, and taken a few hundred pictures with it. The optical and digital zooms are good, but not fantastic. The battery life is a real standout, as it seems to go a lot longer between charges than many cameras that I've used, which is certainly nice when you enjoy going on trips.It doesn't have a super convenient way to charge, though, as plugging it into the computer is the only native method via microUSB to USB cable. That said, a phone charger or Kindle charger adapter can make that transition to a wall socket that you're looking for. The little door that covers the cable slots is a little too tight, making it tricky to get out, and the plastic umbilicus that keeps it attached is too short, making it hard to plug anything into the microUSB slot. That's really my only complaint though.That and the fact that the user manual doesn't really tell me how to use the camera, and I accidentally put it into Russian and can't figure out how to put it back...Apparently in Soviet Russia, camera programs you.Harkius", "Date": "October 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best as an inexpensive HD Camera.", "Author": "M.

Service was excellent and shipping was faster than expected.As for the camera it does have its flaws, but easily overlooked by the price and the amount of customized shots you can get with this point and shoot.PROS: it has a ridiculous amount of different types of camera shots that may or may not ever be used. It has a cat setting for taking a pic of a cat, which my family doesn't have one.  The zoom for macro and close up is good. I only say good because once you fully zoom the lens, it becomes to shaky to take a pic without a tripod even with anti shake setting and lightly holding the button to focus before taking a picture.  This camera has panorama, and burst shots for moving objects or kids. So you can easily get a decent pic of your child doing something funny or cool.  Picture quality is great, you can easily change between 14mega pixel down to 12 and so forth. So you can take lesser pics and save room on a memory card for taking videos in HDCONS: stability fully zoom is not great at all. The startup screen takes about 6 seconds before you can take a picture. The flash takes a bit of time to charge before you can use the flash for any pictures. It's also not as user friendly with the dials and button, so it takes time to figure your way around all the settings and such.I still believe that this camera is a great bang for your buck, especially  at the price point.

Too much to ask? Probably. But this GE camera fulfills my \"easy to use\" requirement. It was very easy to set up and it has a large accessible display screen. The zoom is pretty powerful for such a small point and shoot, far better than any I've owned previously. That's where my compliments end.To start, video quality is horrible. It's grainy even in proper light and can't ever seem to focus on anything for more than 30 seconds. I've never seen such poor video quality in a camera before. My iPhone takes MUCH better video. The audio quality is also horrendous. I can't expect it to pick up audio from across the park, but across my living room? Everything sounds muffled and distant. A big bonus is when the audio just cuts out completely every few minutes and lasts for anywhere from 10 seconds to several minutes. The picture quality is also terrible. Even sitting perfectly still taking a picture of my puppy who was doing her best to sit still, the pictures are blurred. This I am used to with my iPhone 4S being my primary picture taker, but I was expecting much more from this camera. I could go on about some of the annoying features (or lack thereof) but I think the fact that it fails to take any quality pictures or videos is quite enough to warrant this a warning to steer clear.

I thought it was a marvelous piece of work, particularly since it has a 15X optical zoom.  My first batch of photos turned out sharp and clear, and I believed I had bought a real winner.  Unfortunately, after about a week-and-a-half, the camera started showing a bright, blurry spot, right in the middle of the screen-viewfinder.  Much more revolting is the fact that the blurry spot TRANSFERS ONTO THE PICTURES!!  That's right, a gigantic, ugly spot on each photo.  I tried cleaning the lens (no effect); setting the camera to other, multiple types of shooting options (no effect); and finally realized that there is evidently some sort of defect within the camera itself, which, quite obviously, I have no way whatsoever to correct.  Very thankfully, the Amazon Marketplace vendor from whom I purchased it told me to return it, which I have done, and that supplier will get a well-deserved 5-star rating from me, once my refund is in place, for having been kind enough to allow me to return it.
