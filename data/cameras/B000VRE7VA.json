There are a lot of new cameras with exciting new features.  But in my opion this is the LAST GREAT APS format still image DSLRs.  And looking at Sony's unfornunate need to copy Nikon with things like cluttering the Shutter Button with a power switch on all new models the A700, A900 (which I have used) and A850 may be the last cameras that fit the hand and quick clean shooting experience.  Since I wrote this review Sony did a major Firmware upgrade that improved image quality related to high ISO noise and allows users to show RAW with no noise reduction.  On top of that Lightroom 3 fixes the problems Adobe had dealing with Sony RAW files. Both of these upgrades were for me were like getting a new camera.  There are moments video would be nice, I would like the improvements in focusing Sony and others have created in the past 3 years.  But I have to say.. there are cars with features and classic cars people love to drive.. The A700 is a camera that makes photography a joy and all the new features seem to only clutter that experience so someday I will add a new camera to my gear.  I will never \"upgrade the A700\" I think it as a moment of magic for still photography before Video and more technology transformed the experience forever. There is a reason USED and NEW UNSOLD STOCK have held their price so well.  If you own Sony / Minolta lenses this is a great camera to own even though it is one of the last cameras without Live View on LCD etc.  If you want a photograpy tool that doesn't get in the way of your art with features.. think about this camera.  It will be a classic.Original Review Soon after Buying A700 in 2007 -----------------For years I shot Canon SLRs and for a while I moved to Nikon and Canon smaller digicams.  When I jumped back to the SLR format in digital I ended up with the Konica-Minolta 5D over the Canon and Nikon cameras in my budget because of great image quality and in camera stabilization which works very well.I recently upgraded my KM 5D to an A700. WOW!! This is by far the easiest camera I have ever used.  Head and shoulders above traditional menus and tiny LCD Icons.  The rear LCD shows you all the important settings at one time in a large easy to read format, sometimes with colors to alert you to what might be an unusual setting.When you need to change anything from Shutter Speed to White Balance you do it right on the settings screen either by pressing one of the several dedicate buttons or using the easy thumb joystick.  For shooting I almost never have to go into a menu except to format the memory card.Auto Focus and Shutter:It is fast and quiet.  The AF has been tested faster than the new Canon in most lighting situations, though lenses on both systems will affect speed.Both Sony and Now Sigma are coming out with quite focusing lenses that have built in motors so, Sony users will have lots new lens choices.KEY FEATURES I LIKE:Stabilization:The in body stabilization works well  With my 18-250 I have pulled off some shots even at 1/10s while at 250mm  That is over 5 stops of stabilization, Sony only claims 3.5 stops.  This stabilization works on all Sony And Minolta format auto-focus lenses.  Some systems like Canon do not offer stabilized lenses in key formats like primes(non zooms) that are used for close-up macro shots or portrait work.  It also adds cost and weight to each lens, with this system if you can find a bargain on a lower cost lens or a used lens it is still stabalized.Example: Minolta made a 70-210 f4 lens often called a \"beercan\" that is legend in sharpness and image quality. It is often seen used here and on auction sites for $125-$175.  It like all Sony compatible lenses becomes stabilized and would be like getting a $600 plus lens for $150.ISO:The Sony A700 offers ISO 100-3200 and up to 6400 as \"extended ISO\" but all ISO ranges are available at all times, no menu settings will enable or disable them like on the Canon 40D.  It offers the ISO in 1/3 stop increments, but using the the front control wheel lets you jump a full stop at a time.Dynamic Range Optimizer (DRO):Sony has several levels of DRO that do what used to take shooting in RAW format and working in tools like Photoshop.  It automatically recovers overly bright areas and areas hidden in the shadows so your pictures look more like what your eye can see.  Unlike some other cameras that just apply shadow recovery settings to the whole image, Sony has DRO levels that analyze and adjust the image by area to make the effect more natural and keep noise down.Wireless Flash:The built in flash is also a wireless trigger for the Sony Flashes and others including the old KM 5600hs and 3600HS, and some Sigma and Metz models.  On some systems this is a $150 to $200 add on.Remote abilities included:For taking family shots etc.  Sony has free wireless remote that lets you take trigger the camera or a 2 second delay then shoot.  Plus tons of controls for showing and reviewing your images on a TV. If you hook up the camera to an HDMI TV and to a printer at the same time you can do a family slide show and tell it to print picture from the remote as people ask for copies.It also has remote control software for the computer so you can set it up like a studio and shoot and review images from the attached PC.  Great for doing lots of portraits at events without more expensive software or accessories.It supports both Standard Video and HDMI output so you can see the images on your new HD TV.Memory Card Support:Unlike the 40D it supports the new UDMA 300x CF cards and memory stick pro HG so that you can take 25+ cRAW shots a 5 FPS before it needs to pause or an unlimited number of JPGS in any size.  You can have both a CF card and Memory stick installed at the same time and switch over when one fills without stopping to open your bag and change memory cards.Body Seals:Its not splash proof but Sony has sealed all the doors and controls so dust and stray moisture will not hurt the camera.  Some makers like Canon reserve full seals for more expensive cameras.IT JUST FEELS GOOD IN MY HAND:It was love at first touch.. a camera designed to fit in the hand.Unless there is a specific lens or very special accessory that you need on another camera brand, this camera should be #1 or near the top of the list for cameras you consider.Sony may be new to DSLRs, but they make sensors for lots other DSLRs like Nikon and when they bought the camera business they got most of the designers with years of experience from Minolta.  Sony is building cameras for people who love photography and with features for people who like a camera to work with new technology like HD TVs. That makes it a fun camera to own.I looked at the Canon 30D, 40D, Pentax K10D and Nikon D300 before choosing this camera.BTW the Nikon D300, would be my second choice, but would cost much more, and still would have limited options on which lenses are stabalized.", "Date": "November 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sony's First True Professional Grade Digital SLR", "Author": "John Kwok", "ReviewID": "R33H0BALNSIRW3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Late last month I had the good fortune to try the Sony Alpha 700 camera at Sony's Photo Plus East booth. I found the camera easy to use, with the controls well-laid out from an ergonomic perspective. I was surprised that I could activate autofocusing via my eye movement. I was also quite impressed with the camera's built-in image stabilizer. And yet, what impressed me most was how well the camera performed with two Zeiss lenses I borrowed; a zoom lens and the Zeiss 85mm f1.4 Planar (Both lenses, along with the 135mm Sonnar, are built in Japan by Sony using not only Zeiss designs, but also stringent Zeiss quality control. As an aside, I heard incorrectly from a Sony representative that Zeiss doesn't build its own lenses, but allows others to manufacture them under the Zeiss name. This is an incorrect statement since Zeiss builds several lenses for its ZM rangefinder camera system and the Hasselblad V series medium format cameras at its Oberkochen, Germany factory.). Both lenses produced crisp, high contrast images of the kind I've come to expect from Zeiss lenses, having used both discontinued Contax/Yashica SLR Zeiss lenses and Zeiss Ikon ZM rangefinder Zeiss lenses recently.The Sony Alpha 700 is a true professional grade digital SLR, built to similar exacting standards as those from its key competitors; Canon and Nikon. While the camera reminds me most of an updgraded version of late, lamented Minolta Maxxum flagship professional digital SLR cameras, there are ample new features built within the camera that demonstrate Sony's commitment to technical innovation, beginning with the built-in image stabilizer. Therefore, this new digital SLR will appeal to those who are either advanced amateur or professional photographers, especially those who are familiar with the Minolta Maxxum system (However, I predict that Sony's new innovations, including its autofocusing Zeiss lenses, will draw some interest from photographers who might otherwise consider only Canon or Nikon digital SLRs.). Believe the hype about this camera which you may have read in Popular Photography, American Photo or Shutterbug. It is hype that is indeed well-earned.", "Date": "November 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent, class leading DSLR, but not perfect (what is?)", "Author": "George Nada", "ReviewID": "R3NXKCDGESUOBT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a Canon 5D and although it produces impressive pictures, I found too many of my pictures were blurred and I found myself not carrying my 5D around as it was a heavy camera (front heavy and hard to hold still IMHO) with the 24-105mm lens attached (hence the blurred shots). I started to look for a smaller and lighter camera - comfort was a major issue as was the size of the viewfinder and quality of the LCD as the 5D's LCD is frankly poor - very hard to tell if something was sharply focused or the appropriate colour. I tried out the following:Pentax K20 - didn't like the focusing system or the LCD menu system, but otherwise impressed with the camera. Also, it's not a Nikon or Canon which is attractive given their saturation of the market - it's good not to go with the herd sometimes! Good range of lenses.Nikon D80 - uncomfortably ergonomics for me, as with the D300, the thumb rest digs right into the lower joint of my thumb making it hard to hold firmly, I also didn't like the reversal of the focus and zoom rings on their lenses (focus at the back, zoom at the front).Nikon D300 - very nice camera, but almost 100g heavier than the 5D!Canon 40D - very similar to the 5D in terms of size, weight and shape. Comfortable but bland ergonomics and still on the heavy side. Nice big viewfinder, very impressive large information in the viewfinder too, compatible with my existing lenses. But it's a Canon (I have an aversion to monopolies or duopolies - it's not good for consumers or innovation!) and with their quality 17-80 lens it was going to weigh little less than the 5D.Olympus 510 - brilliant size, weight and comfortable ergonomics, good kit lenses. I don't like the 4/3rds system (a smaller sensor just can't be better as I found with comparisons to the 5D and it makes the viewfinder very small) and their menu system is plain ugly. With a 900,000 pixel moveable screen and cleaner menu, Olympus would corner the small DSLR market.I decided to buy an A700 with a Carl Zeiss 16-80 lens and have used it for a couple of weeks and overall I am very happy - I use it far more than the 5D as it is light and small and easy to carry. On the downside, the picture quality is not as good as the 5D especially at high ISOs where the Sony is noticeably grainy. Amateur Photographer has a review in their current issue which shows that in terms of IQ, resolution and noise the 5D beats the D300 and 40D, so the A700 really can't compete. But there's no point having the best camera sitting at home gathering dust.Sony A700 Pros:- Lightweight and small compared to others in class.- Very nice ergonomics and comfort in the hand. Easy to hold very tight with very little camera wobble compared to the 5D which is front-heavy and less easy to hold still.- Brilliant LCD, easy to check colour accuracy and sharpness - don't even need to zoom to check focus. Sony and Nikon are miles ahead of Canon, Olympus and Pentax here.- Carl Zeiss lens is lightweight and small too, with a very useful range. Very sharp and colourful lens.- Very bright and large viewfinder - which is so important and put me off Canon's 20D and 30D a few year's ago which have small, pokey viewfinders.- Anti-shake device is superb, makes a huge difference and in my view is better than the lens version with Canon and Nikon. It applies to all lenses which is a major plus.- I love the shake level meter in the viewfinder window. It is brilliant and almost on its own has made me a convert to the A700. A little chart fluctuates depending on camera shake, so you wait until the chart drops and then take the picture - it is so helpful.- White balance settings have 7 variable settings (-3, 0, +3) which is very helpful.- Lovely clean menu system, easier and quicker than Canon and up there with Nikon's which is also lovely to use. Olympus and Pentax really needs to take note, as their menus are cluttered and not intuitive. The A700's menu is a pleasure to navigate.- Dedicated ISO, drive, WB and exposure buttons is very quick and useful, all are large and easy to press and can be used without even taking one's eye away from the viewfinder. Also a custom function button (NOT a direct printer button like Canon!). I don't miss the top LCD screen at all - big buttons are more helpful!- Compressed RAW looks as good as RAW but takes less space and time.- Outdoor shots are very sharp, very colourful and contrasty. I mainly take travel and outdoor pics so this camera really suits my style and needs.Sony A700 Cons:- Picture quality and resolution is not up to Canon 5D standards (but matches 40D and D80 etc). I appreciate they are not like-for-like cameras or in the same class, and the 5D is full frame etc, but it is 3+ years old. My experience is borne out by Amateur Photographer - full frame is best. I should add that at low ISOs (200 or below) and shooting RAW or cRAW the Sony output is almost as good as the Canon, which when coupled with the Sony's size, weight, LCD and anti-shake device is enough for me.- Where the Sony suffers is at higher ISOs. At 800 the 5D has almost zero grain or noise whereas the Sony, to me, is noisy in the shadows and darkers areas of the pic. If you mainly shoot indoors or in low light, this may not be the right camera for you.- Poor dedicated range of lenses. Not as many lenses as available for Canon and not the same quality either in terms of build and glass. Too many of the Sony lenses I have read about have had poor reviews. No problems if you have Minolta glass - but again, not the range or quality of Canon.- Too few Sony lenses have USM/HSM/SSM etc motors. The Zeiss lens is quick but not as quick as my Canon lenses with USM motors. More importantly the Zeiss lens is very \"squeaky\" in use - when going from completely out of focus to focus there is an audible whirr and squeak as it is not an SSM lens. Only the high-end telephotos have SSM. Also, many of the Sigma lenses don't have HSM while they do for Canon and Nikon mounts making them also loud and slower.- WB under incandescent light is poor - very orange cast and even with the parameters being changed, is still badly inaccurate.- There is no ISO reading in the viewfinder info bar which would be helpful and is standard at this level of DSLR.- The AEL button is very raised away from the body, as a result, when pressed, it is hard to keep my glasses close to the viewfinder and my view becomes distorted - this is actually quite annoying, but nevertheless not a deal breaker by any means.- The rubber grips on the lens are very fine and are a dust magnet. It's a really minor point, but after one week my Carl Zeiss lens looked shabby because any dust and dirt gets stuck in the fine rubber ridges and is really hard to clean.Overall:Overall the Sony A700 is a really excellent camera if you shoot at low ISOs (800 or under), mainly shoot outdoors and want something light and compact to carry all day. If you are coming from film where shooting higher than ISO 400 was virtually unheard of, this is a great camera. I give it 4 stars not 5 as it is not perfect (though arguably no camera is perfect, and this comes as close as any) - to me it is a bit too noisy from ISO 400 up, certainly compared to the D300 with which it shares a sensor. But, it doesn't matter 90% of the time. V Highly Recommended.", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Finally a great camera ... FINALLY", "Author": "F.C. \"photogfr1\"", "ReviewID": "R5WJE4NQNR4UG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to start off by saying I did not want to like this camera! I have been a Minolta professional since the early 90's and embraced the Konica/Minolta 7D when it FINALLY hit the market. But I was very disappointed when Sony bought out the line then only produced the equivalent of the K/M 5D. Definitely a descent consumer grade camera, but not suited for professional work. I waited and waited and decided to jump ship to Canon. Then I heard a rumor of an upgrade to their line. In a way they ticked me off. The wait was way too long and I had decided to spend an exorbitant amount of money to switch systems. The camera body is irrelevant from a financial standpoint. I have about twelve grand tied up in specialty lenses that I use on a consistent basis.So, with the rumor in the air, I waited a bit longer. I won't say that I am thrilled I waited, but I will say that I am becoming increasingly happy with this camera. In some ways, it surpasses it's competition, the new 40D. In other ways, the Canon has it beat. I'm not a loyalist, I am realistic about equipment.What bugs me about this camera:First, simple and silly perhaps, but since this camera is a solid 100 to 200 dollars higher than the Canon, I would hope, dare I say, expect it to come with a CF card. Nope! Now, they are cheep enough today, but all the more reason to include one.Second, I have lived without it for years, but I would like to see live preview like you find on the Canon and Nikon equivalents. It would be beneficial while shooting architecture as well as table top. I view on a big LCD TV and it would be nice to see live preview.Also, 12 bit instead of 14 bit color like Canon has. No huge deal, but we are moving forward, right?Now, what I love about the camera. I have been shooting the K/M 7D since it first came out and the controls are similar enough to get right in and go. I love the virtual \"one button for each function\" thing. And the quick navigator was intimidating for about three seconds, then it was/is just great.The screen is very hi res and gives great detail. I can actually zoom in and get exceptional proofing right on the camera itself. Canon and Nikon both are pretty good too, but I have to say the Sony has them beat hands down with the screen.I shoot Architecture quite a lot and always use the K temperature setting. On this camera, it is accurate and matches the settings given to me by my color meter. What blew me away was seeing a green/Magenta adjustment along with the K value setting. It is listed in full degrees and not fractions like my filter package, but the thing saves a lot of time correcting in Photoshop and calculating filters. The beauty is that it is done manually in camera and there is no \"ghosting\" effect or picture degradation due to multiple filters being used in front of my lens. The thing works GREAT!Also for architecture and any ultra wide shots, the Sony 11-18 mm zoom is proving to be the most distortion free lens of it's kind on the market today. The lens is virtually distortion free. This lens is superior to the Canon and Nikon equivalents that cost almost twice as much.Now, 12 meg. 20% more than offered by the other two in the same range of camera. Not noticeable in some cases like portraiture when you simply don't need that much res, but surely worth it in commercial and architectural shooting.The remote control is pretty slick too. Without switching anything in the camera, you can hit the standard shutter button or a 2 second delay. I thought the delay would be really cool, because every other camera I ever had with a two second delay was used because the mirror locked up immediately and two seconds later the camera shutter went off, effectively removing the chance of camera vibration. This thing just waits two seconds and fires normally. So, I have no idea why there is a 2 second delay button. Perhaps someone can enlighten me. But I have to admit, I find myself using it in several cases. It's a nice option.The best reason now, I have read in Pop-photog that Sony told them that this would be their Midlevel camera. If that means they will be coming out with a 900 model with, perhaps, a full frame in the 22 meg range. I will be a very happy camper!The bottom line for me is, it took them a bit too long, but it looks like Sony is actually producing a serious intermediat/professional grade camera. I will stay for a bit longer and see where this goes.All of this and much more makes me glad I now have this camera.The functions are easy, as easy as any on a camera with so many features. I really like the camera. For now, I will stick with the line and see where they go with it. Hopefully, Sony will keep with it's tradition of innovation and excellence they are known for in video and television industry and move forward with a true usable professional line.", "Date": "December 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Possibly the best value in semi-Pro Digital SLRs", "Author": "Timothy K. Hamilton \"Creativity+\"", "ReviewID": "R1MQRNQQHP5AE6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony Alpha A700K 12.24MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-70mm f/3.5-5.6 Aspherical ED LensSony Alpha A700 12.24MP Digital SLR Camera with 16-105mm LensSony Alpha A700 12.24MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)A FREE color temperature analyzer included (which would cost $1,200 separately)! As I describe below, there is a little discussed feature that allows you to set the white balance for the ambient light practically perfectly.I have had my Sony Alpha 700 for about six weeks now, have used it extensively on a vacation, and have tried most of the features.I'm impressed with:- the solid \"feel\" of the camera build- the 5 frames per second continuous shooting until the card is full (many other more expensive cameras have a limit)- autofocus is blazing fast, and as reviewed in PopPhoto, is faster than even the best Nikons and Canons in good light.- there are several ways to access almost any setting or function, and seemingly endless customization of settings.- Though the Auto white balance isn't always as accurate as I'd like, there is an amazing feature with will allow you to set an custom white balance in a mixed or difficult light situation by using a gray or white card and having the camera \"read\" the light. It not only gets the Kelvin temperature right, but also adjust to Green/Magenta filter color casts from G9 to M9. To get that quality ambient light sensing, you would have to buy a $1,200 Color temperature sensor (Minolta made one). So basically you get a color analyzer for free with the camera.- I have quickly gotten used to the separate buttons for the setting I adjust most frequently: Drive setting (for bracketing or time delay), White Balance, and ISO.- The Dynamic Range (DR) Capabilities are phenomenal. I've shot photos in horribly contrasty situations and been able to get detail in both shadows and highlights. There are 8 levels of adjustment for DR.- The information you can get on playback is extensive and useful when you press the \"C\" button.- I love having a % of battery life left, but I hated having to have to sell my old batteries from my Alpha 100 because they won't fit due to the new feature.What I don't like:- the little \"joystick\" control is difficult for me when I try to press it to confirm a setting. Otherwise it works fine directionally.- I've found that I get better exposures with a -.5 EV compensation. The histograms are almost always perfect in that situation.Overall, it's the best value in a semi-pro (bang for the buck) that I've come across after extensive evaluation. I'm also confident that Sony will continue to market it's DSLRs seriously and continue to offer a wider model line. Sony has staying power and marketing muscle. So far it only has about 6% of the worldwide DSLR market, but I'm confident that will grow due to the quality and value of it's camera product line, including the Zeiss lenses.", "Date": "July 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not a Sony Fan...Until Now!!!", "Author": "David A. Mcclelland", "ReviewID": "R1XQIBH5ELBFEC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony Alpha A700 12.24MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)Sony Alpha A700 12.24MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-70mm f/3.5-5.6 Aspherical ED LensSome people are die-hard Sony fans...anything they purchase has to be a Sony. I don't fit into that catagory. In fact, when I was setting up my home theatre, I didn't even consider Sony. I could go as far as saying I really hate sony...proprietory memory cards and over priced products to name a few of my dislikes.When I started searching for my first DSLR, I started at [...]. I have always found their site to be unbiased and not company sponsered. I noticed while there that the top picks included the A700. I Reluctantly read their review and then proceded to do more on-line research about this camera.Having not owned a DSLR before, I was able to look at a lot of cameras without a specific brand(some folks already have lens so they tend to be brand specific). After lots of research, I ended up back at the Sony. I seriously considered the Nikon D300 but I found that for an extra $500, the Sony was the best buy for me. It doesn't have quite as many pro features but it was a lot of camera for less money. If you google a700 vs. D300 you will find people who have shot identical photos with both cameras and they post the results side by side. The honest truth is that in many of these samples, the D300 shoots a slightly crisper, sharper picture but not even close to $500 worth. Also, in my reading, a few sites have suggested that Sony is acually producing the sensor for both cameras just slight tweaked for the Nikon. I can't confirm that for sure but it was said by some reliable photography websites.I picked up the A700, which I should mention was a replacement for my Minolta Dimage 5 purchased in 2001. Obviously we are talking totally different leagues if you know that camera at all (it was a digital camera with an LCD viewfinder simulating an SLR but not truely an Single Lens Reflex). I spent the extra cash and bought the SAL1680Z Carl Zeiss\u00ae Vario-Sonnar\u00ae T* DT 16-80mm F3.5-4.5 ZA Lens. I had a chance at Henry's Camera store to try out the different lens and upload samples to their computer and the Carl Zeiss lens produced a more accurate picture, particularly in the whites and light grays. Also the edge detail of items was cleaner. For the card, I bought a LEXAR 4GB UDMA 300x card which is the new highspeed format writing at 45 meg per sec. This card is fast and the camera fully supports it. I should note that if you tend not to use the camera to upload to the computer, you have to have a special UDMA compactflash card reader to enjoy the full benefits of a highspeed card.My photography background is self taught, stictly a hobbiest and non-professional. My goal for this camera is to take some courses (staring in January) and learn how to operate a camera in more that just \"Auto\". Out of the box, I have to say that this is truely a camera that can be used by an amateur photographer like myself and obtain amazing results. The pictures in daylight are superb with crisp, sharp images and astounding colour accuracy. With my old camera, the challenge was taking night or reduced light shots. The image stabilization in this camera is amazing. I can actually take zoom shots at night, with no tripod with clarity and depth. The other thing that I really, really appreciate with this camera is the size and amazing detail of the LCD screen. I remember with my old camera, going to Chicago to Navy Pier on a beautiful night waiting for the fireworks. During that wait, we took some beautiful shots of the sunset, the city at night and the fireworks...but we didn't have a tripod. Pictures looked great on the tiny little low resolutiuon 1.5\" screen...but then we uploaded them to the computer, what a disappointment...only a small handfull turned out. The Sony A700 makes this problem history. To me, it makes a lot of sense to have the stabilization on board the camera rather than have to \"buy\" it with each lens or compensating by always lugging a tripod. Even if there is a slight blur in a photo, the high quality LCD lets you see the picture is not clear and it allows you to reshoot.The manual that came with this camera was actually really good. Some manuals are nightmares but not this one. It not only goes over the description, it shows comparison samples of different settings. The on-screen menu on the LCD is easy to navigate but many common features of the menu can also be accessed by buttons on the top of the camera (Drive, white balance etc.) Even the pre-set features like \"Vivid\", \"Portrait\" and \"Night\" perform extremely well. My last camera didn't always perform well with these settings.D-Range is another really neat feature. This is a setting that allows the camera to adjust to those photos where a dark object is in front of a light background. Like a person standing in front of a window on a sunny day. It can be set to auto adjust or by manual increments. I took a photo the other day of a home decor item hanging in the window. With d-range turned off, the item and the wall around the window was too dark to make out. Turn it on to auto and the item was more visible while still maintaining the detail of the trees in the background of the window. Then by tweaking the setting in manual D-Range, the item hanging in the window was perfectly focused while the highlights of the exterior were still visible with a subtle blur.The battery life is not as long as some of its competitors, rated at 650 shots per full charge based on a mix of flash and non-flash use. What is really great is that the battery tells you exactly how much charge is left in percentage value.Something that was included that I really like is the remote control. Yesterday our family got together for Christmas and for the first time in many years, we were able to get a family shot with everyone together. Usually for us the camera person is missing. Also, my wife and I like to take trips to areas where we can go hiking. We have lots of photos of nature and lots of photos with one of us but now we will have shots with both of us. The remote can also control the camera's slide show if hooked to a tv. While on the topic of TV's the HDMI output to HDTV is available (I haven't bought the cable yet). If you are shooting photos for tv use only, the camera can be set to take in wide screen format which is nice for certain applications.As mentioned, I am taking a part-time course at our community college. I am looking forward to discovering the full potential of this camera. Based on reviews I have read and my limited experience thus far, the A700 has put Sony as a worthy competitor in the Advanced Amateur/Semi-Pro catagory. It is also nice to see Sony cameras with CompactFlash slots which are cheaper to buy and just plain faster.", "Date": "December 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Oleg St.", "ReviewID": "R3Q6XXK7BJF0AD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera yesterday from the SonyStyle retailer store. This DSLR is AWESOME!!! I was conducting thorough research comparing it mainly with Canon 40d (I previously used Canons only). Sony has many features Canon does not have, in particular - internal stabilization, which makes lenses price cheaper, and HD output. Sony is a bit slower in burst shooting: 5 fps against Canon 6.5 fps, but if you are not exclusively into sports, that really does not matter. And, of course, Sony LCD display is much superior.Well done, Sony! A+P.S. Don't buy it with a kit lens - it is ok, but not the best choise.

MacWade", "ReviewID": "R30QLGA2Y1KGTV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think it is a foregone conclusion that if you are invested in Canon or Nikon, then you have no compelling reason to even look at this camera.  But for the first-time SLR buyer, there are a lot of reasons.I am a first-time digital SLR buyer.  I was looking at the Nikon D80 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera (Body only) for a very long time.  I was also considering the Sigma SD14 14MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only), as I preferred its feel and ergonomics (and I love Sigma lenses, I had used them on film SLRs before).  I wanted an APS-sized sensor for my camera, so I din't consider any of the Four-Thirds models.  I wanted a full-size, rugged SLR.  Nikon, Sigma, Fuji, and Canon were all on my initial list.But then Sony announced last year that they were going to make CMOS sensors for themselves and Nikon.  I knew that such sensors should improve a problem I have been suffering with CCD sensors for years, which is noise.  When I saw the first product pictures online, I immediately put it on my list of candidates.And when I finally got to hold an A700 in November, it was love at first shot.  The ergonomics are better for me than anything I have seen with Canon or Nikon.  The grip, shutter release button, and thumb and index finger wheels feel like they are in the perfect locations.  I love the speed.  You can turn it on and take a picture in under 3 seconds.  That's fast enough for an amateur like me.  And it has the sweetest shutter sound I've ever heard on a digital SLR.  Small details, but very appealing.At a practical level, the camera's rich list of features and sensor stabilization make it a better camera than the D80, for just a few hundred more.  The only thing it lacks that pro photographers would want is an LCD status screen up on top.  But Sony assumed that amateurs like me wouldn't mind having the settings displayed on the giant 3\" LCD on the back, and in my case, they were correct.If you want live view and a second LCD status display, then the Nikon D300 is a logical choice.  It's a great camera for a little more money.  As far as image quality is concerned, I have to agree with the pro users that the Nikon D300 has fewer noise issues, while the Sony A700 has better color reproduction.  (The minor noise issues with the Sony can be fixed with some software updates, and we A700 users are waiting for both Sony and Adobe to address them.)  It's interesting since both cameras have a very similar sensor.  But the difference lies in how the images are processed in the camera.  Sony has a series of processing technologies in this camera, most of which work great for the amateur photographers who don't want to spend a lot of time with manual processing (Adobe Lightroom, Apple Aperture, etc.).  The pros out there are a little annoyed that this Sony assumes that they want advanced noise reduction and some extra preprocessing.  After all, an image in RAW format can have the noise reduced later on a desktop or laptop, why have the camera interfere?Again, it was a judgment call made by Sony that most A700 users would not be artists, but rather photojournalists and amateurs.  I can see the photojournalist influence in the camera's design.  By having separate buttons for White Balance, ISO, and Drive, the camera can be easily adjusted by a user who is in a hurry and/or wearing gloves.This is a camera made for outdoor use.  The Sigma SD-14, in comparison, is a camera that is best in a studio.  The Sigma is renowned for its use in the fashion industry.  But its menus are not as intuitive as the Sony.  And once outside, the Sigma has noise issues at 800 ISO.  I don't detect noise problems with the Sony until I get up to 1600 or 3200 ISO, depending on the light source.I should mention that the menus in Sony A700 main LCD screen are beautiful, easy to access, and make sense.  There are multiple ways to access the grid of settings including the three dedicated buttons mentioned above.  Want to adjust ISO and then exposure?  Just push the ISO button, make the change there, and then use the joystick to highlight the exposure control, then center-click to save.  The wheels (one for index finger, one for thumb) can be programmed to adjust aperture and shutter speed however you wish.  You will be shooting crisp, professional looking photographs soon after you take the camera out of the box and charge the battery.  It immediately made me a better photographer.And for lenses, the news is just getting better.  Sony is releasing at least 4 new lenses this year, including a 'beercan' style 70-300 telephoto, and an amazing 24-70 f2.8 Carl Zeiss, which could be the ultimate full-frame portrait lens.  This camera is not full-frame, as it uses an APS-C sensor.  But Sony is getting ready to release the A900 full-frame professional SLR, and we're already seeing some lenses designed for it.  Also, Tamron and Sigma both support the alpha-mount (formerly Minolta), and their lenses are worth a look.  I highly recommend the Sigma 18-50 f2.8 as a great walk-around lens to start with.  And Sony has the wonderful 16-80 Carl Zeiss as a walk-around choice.  Sony also offers a lightweight 11-18 ultrawide zoom for architecture photography (indoor and outdoor).  And there are others in the pipeline.  All total, there are about 40 lenses you can purchase for this camera brand-new, and any used Minolta or other alpha mount lens will work as well (most notable is the famous Minolta 70-210 \"beercan\" from the 1980s).But no digital SLR should be purchased without picking it up and trying it out.  Get yourself a Compact Flash memory card, go to a camera store, and take some shots.  You might understand why we Sony users are excited.", "Date": "March 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great semi-pro camera, great value.", "Author": "Timothy K. Hamilton \"Creativity+\"", "ReviewID": "R1JND39X7SKPAZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A FREE color temperature analyzer included (which would cost $1,200 separately)! As I describe below, there is a little discussed feature that allows you to set the white balance for the ambient light practically perfectly.I have had my Sony Alpha 700 for about six weeks now, have used it extensively on a vacation, and have tried most of the features.I'm impressed with:- the solid \"feel\" of the camera build- the 5 frames per second continuous shooting until the card is full (many other more expensive cameras have a limit)- autofocus is blazing fast, and as reviewed in PopPhoto, is faster than even the best Nikons and Canons in good light.- there are several ways to access almost any setting or function, and seemingly endless customization of settings.- Though the Auto white balance isn't always as accurate as I'd like, there is an amazing feature with will allow you to set an custom white balance in a mixed or difficult light situation by using a gray or white card and having the camera \"read\" the light. It not only gets the Kelvin temperature right, but also adjust to Green/Magenta filter color casts from G9 to M9. To get that quality ambient light sensing, you would have to buy a $1,200 Color temperature sensor (Minolta made one). So basically you get a color analyzer for free with the camera.- I have quickly gotten used to the separate buttons for the setting I adjust most frequently: Drive setting (for bracketing or time delay), White Balance, and ISO.- The Dynamic Range (DR) Capabilities are phenomenal. I've shot photos in horribly contrasty situations and been able to get detail in both shadows and highlights. There are 8 levels of adjustment for DR.- The information you can get on playback is extensive and useful when you press the \"C\" button.- I love having a % of battery life left, but I hated having to have to sell my old batteries from my Alpha 100 because they won't fit due to the new feature.What I don't like:- the little \"joystick\" control is difficult for me when I try to press it to confirm a setting. Otherwise it works fine directionally.- I've found that I get better exposures with a -.5 EV compensation. The histograms are almost always perfect in that situation.Overall, it's the best value in a semi-pro (bang for the buck) that I've come across after extensive evaluation. I'm also confident that Sony will continue to market it's DSLRs seriously and continue to offer a wider model line. Sony has staying power and marketing muscle. So far it only has about 6% of the worldwide DSLR market, but I'm confident that will grow due to the quality and value of it's camera product line, including the Zeiss lenses.Another thing to note:  Sony makes the 12 megapixel sensor for the Nikon D300, and most likely they are the same.

This is my third digital camera and my second DSLR. I used Nikons for many years but, knowing Minolta lenses are just as good and often better than Nikon or Canon or other brands, I took advantage of the momentary panic when Minolta lenses were cheap. I had also used Sony digital cameras with Zeiss optics and enjoyed the image quality, product quality and industrial design. I had also used Sony video equipment in professional settings and knew Sony made great stuff. Also, Nikon cameras use Sony sensors.Now that Sony has fully taken over Minolta and is doing nice work and being innovative, I picked up the A700 on sale.It is a terrific camera.

It practically reinvogorated this camera.It's 12.24 megapixels will work well for large prints (although if you're gonna print wall size, you're better off with the A900).This camera is fast, responsive, easy to use and highly customizable. You can chose from a variety of options to make your photography faster and more enjoyable with this camera.It may be heavy for some people, but thats due to the magnesium casing which protects the inside. This camera is meant for hard work and serious business.For those people who used Minolta SLRs and still keep their lenses, they can use them on this camera, since the Alpha DSLR line benefits of the A-mount that Minolta and KonicaMinolta cameras used.It doesnt have live view, if you need it, you should get the A300/350.This camera however, shares one feature along with its A100/900 sisters, the Depth Of Field button, which in few words, closes down the lens to the selected aperture so you can see how sharp the image will be.

Murphy", "ReviewID": "R2UTJYY2BSD6BM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I came to the a700 from the Sony a100.  I never did shoot with the Minolta 5D or 7D.  Prior to my a100 purchase, I had owned several Sony and Minolta digital p&s; cameras, so moving to the a100 made sense to me. Given that all my film SLR cameras were fully manual, I started my journey into the DSLR world without being tied to any current lens system.I've been shooting with the a700 for about 2 years now.  Somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 shutter actuation's later, it's still going strong.  I live in the Midwest of the United States and this camera has gotten use in four real seasons.  It has been used in the 100 degree heat of our summers and in the negative temps of our worse winter weather. It's a semi-pro body with all the durability you'd expect in this class.  The body feels very solid in your hands and well constructed.Picking up the a700 for the first time, you'll immediately notice the 3\" 640x480 display that dominates the back.  It's the same Sony made display you'll see on Nikon's D300. This screen makes reviewing images and checking focus a breeze.  It is usable in direct sunlight, however it does get somewhat washed out like all LCD displays.Grip the camera in your hand and you'll find two scroll wheels and numerous dedicated buttons at your finger tips.  Dedicated buttons for Drive settings, ISO, WB, EV compensation, Metering, AEL and Instant MF are all within a thumbs reach.  Don't like menu diving to change common settings?  Hit the Fn button button on the back to change many settings without ever leaving the main display.  Want to alter your JPEG settings?  Hit the \"C\" button on the back of the camera for instant fine tuning of JPEG processing.On the grip of the camera you'll find the memory card slot door.  Slide this back and you're presented with one MS PRO DUO card slot and one CF card slot.  You can have a memory card in each slot all of the time.  Unfortunately, you have to switch between cards manually from the menu system.  It would have been preferrable if the camera automatically switched between cards when one filled up.  It is nice to be able to have a backup card in the camera though.Menus can be navigated either using the dual scroll wheels or the dedicated joystick on the back of the camera.  Depressing the joystick or the shutter button will confirm a setting change.  Pressing the shutter button while in any menu will cause the camera to a ready to shoot state.Ergonomics were obviously of great importance to the designers of this camera.  The majority of shooting related settings can be changed without taking your eye off of the viewfinder.  The design is very logical and you'll be able to quickly memorize the button layout.  The display within the viewfinder will allow you to see what settings you're changing.  It's s design intended for speedy and easy settings changes, so you can get busy taking photos rather than hunting through an endless assortment of redundant menus.Since were talking about speed, it should be noted that this is a very speedy and responsive camera.  If you're coming from an a100, prepare to be blown away.  It's not just a matter of 5fps vs. 3fps or the much faster AF module, it's just a far more responsive camera overall.  It is immediately noticeable when changing settings or reviewing photos even. There is no lag when doing anything.  The camera will never slow you down.One of the single biggest improvements the a700 carries over its predecessors is AF speed and accuracy.  It's finally equal or better than the competition in this class. Whereas the a100 had difficulty tracking fast moving objects, the a700 keeps up with ease.  I often resorted to manual focus when shooting hummingbirds with my a100.  The AF of the a700 is good enough that I don't bother with MF for quick moving subjects like hummingbirds anymore.  You get the typical AF settings that are offered with bodies in this class, but I wouldn't have minded if Sony had tossed in a bit more control.  My body did intitially suffer from back focus issues when used with wide angle lenses.  Sony fixed this under warranty and it has been fine since.  Back focus issues are the single biggest complaint I have heard about a700 bodies, so it's something to be weary of.  Sony service can take care of it, but it would have been better if the problem never existed.  Sony is far from the only manfucaturer to prodeuce a camera with BF or FF issues.I think that takes us to image quality!  The a700 will not dissapoint.  Images are vibrant and sharp.  Minolta colors are still there a bit, but there is also a bit of Sony colors there as well.  Metering is consistent and startingly accurate at times.  I don't find myself ever second guessing this cameras metering system.  Image noise is well controlled up to ISO 1600.  Image quality is virtually identical to Nikons pricier and highly regarded D300.  This is not a huge surprise considering they share the same Sony made 12MP image sensor.  Using Sony's Dynamic Range Optimization abilities, you can create some amazing images that would be very hard to impossible to duplicate in a RAW developer.  I have tried and failed numerous times to duplicate what DRO does.  Dynamic range is good for this class of camera.  APS-C sized sensors still leave something to be desired when it comes to dynamic range, but that's life(for now).Pair this body with a good lens and I am sure you'll be extremely pleased with the results.  It's nice that every lens you attach to this body will be stabilized.Battery life has been very good.  The original battery is still going strong after lots of use.  You can use 3rd party batteries in this body.If you buy one, make sure to upgrade the firmware to v1.04 asap.

But I decided to take chances with Sony after reading it's review on [...] and I am very happy with my purchase. I like most -1. Price factor (currently selling under $900). It is cheaper than other in it's class (You can compare it with Nikon D300 as both are using same sensor).2. Great picture quality even in low light conditions.3. In camera Image stabilization. You don't need to pay extra $$$ for every lens to have this functionality.4. High resolution and sharp LCD screen.5. DOF review button.6. Lots of customization options for advanced users - including assigning specific function to custom button. Changing attributes of image styles.7. Nice build and environment seals for buttons.Things which are missing:1. Top LCD panel is missing. Most of advanced SLRs have this.2. Live view, it doesn't matter for me though.3. Software that came with camera is not that good.Other thoughts:Be careful while installing Sony camera software on 64-bit Vista/XP, your machine may not boot. You have to install software from CD then run 64-bit update utility to upgrade it to use with 64-bit OS.Sigma/Tamron lenses are nice alternatives to some expensive Sony lenses.

SONY 18-200mm LENS:  the Sony 18-200 mm lens may very possibly have the optical system of the Tamron 18-200mm lens, mounted in a Sony lens mount (Sony owns Tamron).  Tamron introduced a newer 18-250mm lens in 2007, which also comes in a Sony version, and the 18-200mm has become essentially a closeout item.  Originally priced at $499, the 18-200mm lens is now offered for only $200 extra when bought with an Alpha 700 body (the newer Sony 18-250mm lens now costs $549).  But the 18-200mm is close in optical quality to the highly praised Tamron/Sony 18-250mm, it is very sharp at most focal lengths, and my copy is mechanically perfect, with smooth zooming and no `creep.'  For only $200 extra with a camera body, the Sony 18-200mm lens is not just a bargain, it's a steal.", "Date": "April 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "midrange pro camera", "Author": "digidreamgrafix com \"digidreamgrafix com\"", "ReviewID": "R124C7P619DRG3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent camera, great solution after a300 and a350 to all those noisy images.  a700 is just great camera,. i own canon 40d and nikon d90, but use my a700 60% of the time.  picture quality is just superb.  thanks SONY. nice 5 exposure bracketing for HDR photography as well.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "A great camera all around", "Author": "R.

I went back and put a deposit on it that very same day.Even though it took a couple of months of payments- it was very well worth the wait.The camera is intuitive. When I got mine, the setting were all in Japanese, and I worried I had bought one of the Japanese only a700s. After a few minutes of just randomly playing with it, I found the menu to change it to english menu.Ever since, I have enjoyed this camera immensely.The photo quality is incredible, and frankly, unless you are careless or just plain stupid- it is hard NOT to get a good shot with this model.I do mostly equine photography and have yet to regret the purchase decision. The images are always crisp, clear and exquisite.What really attracted me to this camera was that I could purchase Konica Minolta Maxxum lenses for it, and have been able to get a few used ones from ebay very reasonable. So for someone on a budget, this camera is an EXCELLENT choice.The other thing that deeply impressed me, is that this camera HOLDS ITS VALUE! Unlike some of the newer Nikons, this camera still sells used body only for a decent price! Even commanding a higher price then some of it's newer rivals!

I spent months researching Canon and Nikon (I am sure they are great too).  I just happened to run across Sony Alpha products while reading reviews on other products.  I started looking at the Alpha series with a quite a bit of skepticism, and really trying to find a reason not to buy.  But after spending more time comparing the Sony brand to others I really could find no reason why I needed to spend the extra money on the Canon or Nikon.  Nor could I find anywhere where this line was receiving legitimate negative ratings.  (I do not count egotistical photographers, who are at time overly touchy about their own investment.  I've learned those guys are a dime a dozen)While being new to the world of SLR cameras there was a big learning curve and it did take me a year of reading and learning to master (overstatement) the art (taking it out of Auto Mode).

I BOUGHT IT NEW 3 YEARS AGO FOR LESS THAN $1000!!!Okay...now back to the original review:Let me preface my review by saying that choosing a DSLR is like trying to choose a car from Lexus, BMW, Mercedes, Acura, and Infinity. You really can't go wrong. Canon, Nikon, Sony, Olympus, etc. all make incredible cameras and for 95% of people out there any one of them would be more than adequate.That said, all things considered I'm pretty disappointed in my camera when I see what friends with Canons and Nikons are doing. I started with an A100 several years ago and last year upgraded to the A700 at a Circuit City liquidation sale. I have been pretty satisfied with this camera, but considering this is Sony's prosumer model - an attempt to compete with Nikon's D300 and Canon's 5D/7D - I feel I should be more than just satisfied.Below are my pros & cons of this camera.PROS:1. Compatibility with old Minolta AF lenses gives you thousands of options in glass, and they're extremely inexpensive compared to Canon & Nikon.2. Image stabilization built into the camera body means you don't have to shell out extra cash for an IS or VR lens, as you do with Canon & Nikon.3. The camera body itself is much cheaper than it's counterparts made by Nikon and canon.4. Wireless commander comes with the camera rather than being an accessory that is an extra expense.5. It's a very inexpensive system to be married to. Comparable bodies made by Canon & Nikon are about twice as expensive as this one.CONS:1. No digital display on the top of the camera to give you quick readings on the settings. You must use the display on the back, which uses more battery power.2. The high ISO performance by Sony cameras is terrible when compared to Nikon & Canon. A comment below suggested I upgrade the firmware to version 4, which I did, and I still do not see enough improvement to make me change my review. I have friends who shoot at ISO 1600 with Nikon/Canon without a second thought, and even go up to 3200 with about the same noise (if not less) than what I get out of my camera at 800. The vast majority of my pictures are taken indoors so this is a huge problem for me.The ISO performance is the primary reason I wish I had a Canon or Nikon. I will, of course, do more research and play with the different Canon/Nikon cameras before making a swap, but right now I plan on selling my Sony gear (body, 4 lenses, flash) and swapping to either Canon or Nikon.When I first opted for the Sony body I rationalized my decision by telling myself that I'm really buying a Minolta, which was an experienced body. I also noticed that Sony made (and still makes) the sensors for Nikon. However, after 3 years of using the system I seriously regret my decision.If you're going to be a casual photographer and just want a camera to snap off memories of family get-togethers and vacations then this will be a fantastic camera for you. However, if you ever think photography may become a serious hobby or even a money making adventure then I urge you to do AMPLE research consider what your primary shooting style will be (indoors or outdoors, people or landscapes, etc.) before going with Sony simply because it's the cheaper option.I try to respond to all comments, so if you have any questions about this camera please post them and I'll respond.Also, if anyone knows how to post pictures in a review let me know.

Battery meter is now there to see power levels.  The ISO Wheel is gone, in favor of a drop down menu.  Screen is larger for review. Ergonomic grip is improved.  12.2 MP is better for close cropping.  I find the camera a little easier to use than the A-100.  More information to see on the screen prior to shooting.  I am not sure the body is worth another $900 mare than the A-100", "Date": "November 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Camera Repair", "Author": "Jean Francois Caubet", "ReviewID": "R20ORVH4NQUQ39", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "When I got the camera from SonyStyle, I bought a two year repair plan.A few weeks after I received the camera, I found a small scratch on the lens which may have been triggered by a friction that occured when my camera felt 1-2 inches on a shelve. The shape of the scratch doesn't suggest a contact with a hard material.I called the plan and they referred me to Precision Camera in CT.  Precision Camera first returned the lens because they needed the camera.  Two weeks after I sent the camera with the lens, I called and they said they could not find it.  They eventually found it and said it would take 2-4 weeks for the part to arrive.I called Sony and they said they have a repair facility in Texas.  In other words, the repair plan uses Precision Camera, not Sony.Eventually I found that Precision Camera did not replace the lens but used a sealant to mask the scratch.You may review customer comments about Precision Camera on the web.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bad Camera/Lens?", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "R22TYPQE27XK8V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Pictures look bad.
