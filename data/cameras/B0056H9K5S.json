It has lots of imaging options and they all turn up great. Only flaw is i wish that it had a permanent image preference option. Everytime you turn it off you have to reset your original options..Other than that, this camera is great!!", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Gift for my 12 year old", "Author": "mlm", "ReviewID": "R3UI94454MM2CE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "She loves it.

I think its even better than mine, lol. Good purchase for the money spent!", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the money", "Author": "Cyclebutt", "ReviewID": "R2WXCZDRX65MWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent camera for the money.  I'm a big fan of camera's using rechargeable AA batteries, alkaline back-up in a pinch.  Excellent results as a still camera in ALL lighting conditions.  Great choice of shooting parameters.  Med./Low def. video capability includes zoom while shooting, although zoom speed is WAY too fast/sensitive. Terrible night video quality. Sound quality is good.  Definitely a still camera first, but acceptable video mode is a nice feature.  Recommended buy.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worked great on my Athens vacation!", "Author": "CGH", "ReviewID": "R2RCHVZXUFNJG6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I decided to go to Athens, I wanted to get an inexpensive digital camera. I found this one here (only $70 at the time) and was disappointed when I heard Kodak was leaving the digital market but I knew they made quality products.One of the first pics I took was of the Acropolis...wow. I was a few miles away on my balcony and was able to get terrific pics from there! Of course the up close pics are beautiful and the videos I took from up top the Acropolis and Mount Lycabettus are amazing!As for the rechargeable batteries, I carried extras but never had to swap them out...except for nitetime recharges.Of course there are always cons but they are obvious. Nitetime pics from a distance only came out blurry, pics from airplanes failed due to light reflecting off of their wings and the audio picked up at higher elevations sounded like crowded city streets due to the wind. I hoped that these would have been possible. Like I said...these were obvious but I had to try anyways.Now that the price is a tad bit over $100, would I buy it at that price? Maybe, only due to the fact that I was originally working on a tight budget. Would I recommend it at this price to others? Yes but hold out just to see if the price comes down.", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "lovesamazon", "ReviewID": "R263DZVTAAAY5N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is actually the third of this type of camera we have purchased for our family. It is great size -- small enough to fit in a little purse or even pants pocket. The picture quality is always great and has lots of great settings for every type of situation. I recently went to Disneyland and got some amazing photos of the fireworks over the castle -- which has not be the case with other cameras. I know that Kodak is no longer making cameras but I bought the extended warranty for only $12 and hope to never need to use it. Overall a great product that I highly recommend.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "camera", "Author": "patti m. shute", "ReviewID": "R2LNM1E9JXSY3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "got it for my son. the only thing is, these things NEVER COME WITH AN SD CARD....IF YOU NEED ONE TO OPERATE THE CAMERA PROPERLY, HAVE IT WITH THE CAMERA IN THE FIRST PLACE INSTEAD OF SEPARATELY.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Angela Leblanc \"angieleb13\"", "ReviewID": "RQP592ER74S9C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't take a lot of pictures, but this camera fits my need.
