Yes, all cameras except G3 were 5mp but I was looking for a lot more than just Megapixel power.  Not only was I was shopping for a camera that would suit MY casual and artistic photographic needs, I had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well.  Her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use.The Nikon's are great cameras.  + They have great optics (CP5700 has great optical zoom)and features, not to mention take great pictures.  - The drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer, the LCD screen is a little too small, CP5000 does not take photos in RAW format.Olympus C5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body. + Takes sharp 5mp photo's, has great features and relatively easy to use.  - I didn't care much for the tilting LCD screen, it seemed very limited and not very usefull. Photos had some artifacts and noise.  My fiance just didn't like the way it felt in her hands. We also looked at the Fuji FPs602.  Nice Camera but doesn't take as sharp as pictures I thought they would, and again... fiance didn't like the feel.The Canon G3... 4mp, 4X optical zoom, takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras, easy to understand and use (has a great swivel LCD screen), a LOT of features and add-on options, comes with great software (not to be overlooked), and last but by far not least, received my fiance's stamp of approval (two thumbs up!)A LOT of research went into digital camera's before I made this purchase, and hands down, the G3 had everything I needed plus more.  The other cameras were great and I'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations, but to each his/her own.  I have no buyers remorse with this baby, and I never will.

Canon's optics are better and I believe their processing algorithms are also better. Simply, the Canon G3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point. The Canon allows you to change lenses, and it accepts the IBM Microdrive (Type II Compact Flash), so you can have up to 1 Gigabyte of storage. For me on the Fine resolution setting (not maximum but very close) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 Gig card. The battery life of this camera is twice that of the Nikon 5000 and is better than anything else I've seen. The only minor nits I have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking, it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap, and it is a bit slow between shots. Even with these shortcomings, I still think it is the best digital camera available under $1200.", "Date": "December 14, 2002"}, {"Title": "powerful product", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RSOQ3A85KRBOP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations.In general it is easy to use and well laid out. For ``cool factor'' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and doesn't have any wow factor. It makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly.The G3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro/pro SLR with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography. In the hands of someone who doesn't, it will yield good results on idiot program/auto mode. My wife, who has never used a camera before, picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you don't like what you have created you just delete and try again. The photos she took are better than the results I got from my Nikon SLR and range of lenses! This is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the G3's large mobile screen helps with this.Negative points:The included memory card is too small. Go out and get a 256meg card, it's worth the expense.It is made of plastic. For those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped, picking up a camera like the G3 is an unnerving experience. This is by no means unique to this model, I'm sure. The zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot.This is not a handbag camera. While light, it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets.The function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile.Flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras, you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost. The G3 has a shoe which will take other powerful (and expensive) Canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography.The strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to. If you can afford this camera, you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble.Good points:The functionality on this camera is mind-blowing. Canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out. Learning how to use it will not take very long.The image quality is excellent. Messing around with images in Photoshop (a supplied software package) and printing them on a good printer, yielded excellent results. Unless you are making posters, a G3 is more than good enough.Range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone: point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography.Please note that this is the first digital camera I have owned or used. A lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film. I did extensive research before chosing the G3 but there's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first...", "Date": "January 16, 2003"}, {"Title": "Within its limitations, produces stunning images", "Author": "Frank Paris", "ReviewID": "R3K5VNGMF9D089", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a long-time user of highly responsive film SLRs and professional quality external flash equipment, just so you know my bias. I have been watching the development of digicams for years, waiting to make my first move. What I really want is a $1,500 digital SLR with a full frame sensor that will take my Nikon lenses. I figure that is at least three years off, and I am getting impatient. Hence I decided to spring for a \"point-and-shoot\" digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations. I chose the G3 because of its reputation for very high quality, clean images. The two limitations I knew I would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks (even in bright light), and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash. As of this writing, technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film SLR. At least once you've got focus lock, the shutter release lag time for the G3 is about 1/10 of a second, which from what I've read, is better than just about anything else available. What makes the focus-lock lag time something I can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8. Once I get focus lock, I can then wait until my restless subject (a pet or a child) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus. Now what about the flash problem? Relative to what I can easily achieve with external flash on my Nikon SLR, the internal flash on the G3 produces harsh, flat images with ugly hot spots. Fortunately, the G3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash, and fortunately for me, I already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy: the Metz 60 CT-4. I can't use my Nikon external flash on a Canon camera, but I CAN use my Metz, with the proper Metz module and extension cord connected between the G3 and the 60 CT-4. For those who have this Metz flash (or the 45CL-3) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this G3, the Metz module you need is the SCA 3102 and the connector cord is the SCA 3000C.In order for this to work, you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself. Contrary to what I've read elsewhere, the G3 DOES sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes, just as it does with the dedicated flashes from Canon. You also have to set the G3 to second shutter sync, which is what you'd want to do most of the time anyhow. Then just forget about all the controls you have on the Metz flash head itself and the SCA 3102 control panel, because they are all IGNORED. The G3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the Metz flash, and most of the time, the exposure is spot on and when it isn't, it's because you've exceeded the range of the Metz flash itself. This might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing, or if you ARE bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away. Unfortunately, the neutral density filters for the Metz flash are no longer available, so the first problem can't easily be solved. The second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the Metz (with the attendant shadows unfortunately). But once you've got your exposure within an acceptable range, the G3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that I can hardly get with my Nikon F100 film camera. The 60 CT-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted, enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you. The results are shadow-free images that look as if they've been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine.Now there is one more complaint I have about the G3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images (I only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing I did was replace the 32 MByte CF with a 512 MByte CF, which gives me 130 raw images, as opposed to 7!). The Canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image AT ALL, but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera. I believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information. Maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software, you'd see the true, raw image that the camera actually produces. I didn't wait to experiment. Instead, I bought the Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw plug-in. What this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw G3 hardware. Without any tweaking at all, if the exposure is accurate, the colors are as realistic as I've ever seen produced by film, and this is a raw image! The Adobe Camera Raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software. What the G3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical. What the Photoshop plug-in gives you is REALITY, and then if you want fantasy, you can use Photoshop to create it. But at least you're starting with the most photorealistic images I've ever seen from a camera. I am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images I am getting from this G3 (in conjunction with my professional flash system), and can easily put up with the camera's limitations, because I've never seen anything better within its resolution limits.", "Date": "May 22, 2003"}, {"Title": "I love it more the longer I own it", "Author": "Harold S. Levine", "ReviewID": "R1RQQ70W6XORDQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using a PowerShot S330 for nearly a year, and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom, more adjustability, a hot shoe for an external flash, and a remote control. I looked at both the Nikon Coolpix 5700 and the Canon G3, and decided on the G3 due both to ergonomics (much more comfortable to hold and use) and the price ... I've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far. And so far, I've been very pleased. There's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the S330, especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures. The larger lens of the G3 gives better picture quality in low light, and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer.The moveable LCD screen is great. You can take pictures with the camera held above your head, way down, or beside you with no problem, allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself. The tiny (postage-stamp sized) remote unit is wonderful: not only does it trigger the shutter, it can also be used to zoom and review pictures. I also purchased a good sturdy tripod: the combination of the new camera, tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor, natural-light portraits I never would have attempted before.The hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit: I chose the Canon Speedlite 420. This has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs: the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos, red-eye, and annoying shadows; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing, almost-natural lighting. I needed three batteries to keep myself going with the S330, but the battery in the G3 is a real powerhouse: I shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery. The G3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller Canon cameras: the battery needs to be charged while in the camera, but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery. I have yet to try using all of the adjustment options: shutter priority, aperature priority, light metering adjustments, etc., but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear. You can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting, or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do.Negatives? I've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the S330, and the G3 seems to do only slightly better. (I'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level.) The on-off button feels somewhat flimsy, and has an awkward, tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera. And the body/construction in general has quite a bit of plastic, a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the S330.I bought a 512 MB card, which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution. I was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly, but there's no difference in working with the files. I have a 120 GB remote drive I use to store my digital images: I can imagine that they'd fill up my iBook's internal memory pretty quickly.At the same time I purchased this camera I also bought Adobe's Photoshop Elments 2.0 software, and can't praise it highly enough. If you're investing in a camera at this level, buy this software! And as I said in my review of the S330, all of these digital cameras are easier to use with Apple computers.The bottom line: if you're serious about your digital photography, or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot, this may be just the camera for you. But make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time: you'll see the difference in your photos immediately.Added 2-24.  I've now had the camera for two months and I'm even more pleased with it.  I wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting.  It helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures, especially in mixed-light settings.  If you don't have a gray card, you can use a plain white piece of paper.  I also discovered the exposure-bracket setting, which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter:  the first at the camera-determined exposure, then one lighter and one darker.  Especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations.  I did buy the telephoto lens (and the required extension).  Very easy to use.  I'll probably also get the wide-angle now, too.  Very comfortable camera, easy to use, and the best digital photos you're going to get at this price.", "Date": "December 24, 2002"}, {"Title": "Canon never ceases to amaze, even better than G2", "Author": "Shashank Tripathi", "ReviewID": "R3DK4O63LYTSTI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being a great fan of the G2 I set out with G3 with a somewhat negative expectation, difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as 'perfect' as the Powershot G2. But Canon never fails to amaze. Some of the great gains over G2 -- 1. The ability to selectively switch to RAW format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility.2. Battery life is over 4.5 hours, compared to about 2.5 hours for the G2 or the 2 hours for most Nikons. 3. The Remote Capture and FileViewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing. Looks sort of like Picasa Software (google it if you dont know) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as G2's, but more intuitive.  4. The shape of this device is a little squarer, without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking. A big plus in my book. 5. The 1/200 sec, F5.6 + ND filter for highly exposed (or very brightly lit) environments. The light auto-correction is awesome. You could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right.  6. The G2's \"Color Effect\" exposure mode has now been removed, the replacement is a selectable \"Effect FUNC\" menu option available in all exposure modes. There are six default settings (Off, Vivid, Sepia, Neutral, Low Sharpening, B&W;) as well as a 'Custom Effect' that allows you to control sharpening, contrast and saturation. 7. A new PhotoStich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view. I can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera. (Looks quite neat too suggesting that Canon may have, er, Canonized it a bit). 8. Perhaps inspired by the Canon's factory white-correction settings (which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out), the G3 has much sharper white offsets. In English, this means that even straight out of the box, you'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking.9. In dim lit environs the G2 could easily outperform any other camera, and thankfully G3 maintains this rep. Personally I believe it even outperforms the G2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors. Overall, the G3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current >4 megapixel digicams, from a detail, tonal balance and color response point of view. There's really very little about G3 images to criticize. Short of the EOS range from Canon or the D100s from Nikon (both SLRs) this is quite simply the best you can ask for.", "Date": "April 25, 2003"}, {"Title": "Best non-SLR digital camera under 5 megapixels", "Author": "R.

After doing a hands-on comparison between the Nikon Coolpix 5700 and Sony DSC-F717 (both of which lack the quality, feel, or features of the G3), I ultimately chose the G3 because of its outstanding image quality (resolution and coloration are superior). It beats the competition in almost every area including battery life, enthusiast features, external flash capabilities, available storage types, image formats, and more. This is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features. It can be a point-and-shoot camera, but if you do not intend to \"get into\" it's finer features, I'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice.

The Camera is very easy to use, in fact on a recent trip this past week I was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group.  After I took their picture with their camera, they offered to take a picture of us. I just told them, press halfway, wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way.  They fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely.  (As all of my pictures have thusfar).  A few of my work constituants owned the G2 and highly recommended the Canon for picture quality. I'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet (super fine). Ensure you get a larger flash, 128 or 256, some are selling with the larger flash, 32MB will do in a pinch but you'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4MP cameras.  Bottom line, well made camera, easy to use, very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense/filters choices.

I am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy, I spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera; and i must say, G3 worth every single cent i spent on it.Just a little overview, PowerShot G3 is the flagship of Canon's PowerShot series and its an SLR-like camera, its 4 megapixel and (alsmost) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance. Whether you are a novice or an expert, its ease of use and functionality goes together. + you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes, etc. As its 4MP, you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies (you can record 3 minutes of video). I am using Kingston 512MB CF which works great and is very fast. A good choice could be CF type II, Microdrives that can store around 1 GB of images.Some things that i didn't like (but hey.. nothing is perfect).* Main dial is not backlit.* Lens visible in optical viewfinder.

The Olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the Canon, but one of the features that sold me on the G3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the Canon G3.I would recommend a larger compact-flash card, at least 128 MB.

Beats that Sony F717; its archrival. I'm glad Canon decided to keep the 4Mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology; I can't fit all that resolution(4Mp=2272x 1704 resol.) in my 19in flat monitor(1200x1024 resol.) anyways. Please go to read dpreview.com and you'll get the complete story. My story is based on personal usage.Yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion(I don't like it too but no harm done since I always use the camea LCD screen to see exactly what I'm going to get) in the viewfinder when you don't zoom(when you zoom the lens distortion goes away), Canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon; that is what you see in the viewfinder perimeter is not almost exactly what you will get when you shoot the picture. Moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon. The distortion is not a flaw. As with taking digital pictures, I notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost- this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand.I've haven't heard about a diagnos or fix for this. In terms of the shots taken, this camera is INSANELY GREAT!. The pictures are fabulous and their is a (short)learning curve to it; there are tons of features I haven't even gotten to. In terms of the important accessories,I got myself an the extra litium battery. Based on my used, 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots.  I also got myself a 512MB Viking compact flash(enough for 255 shots at full 4Mp resolution and max picture quality) and a used $250 3lb subnotebook with USB connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so I can verify what I've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash. The compact flash is delicate and I hate to swap it in fear on the connetions(camera and CF) bending(can lead to CF erros) or losing it.Anyways, Canon has improved upon the G2 with this G3. It's a winner. I've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow, car, boat and wind. My only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens(the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes) and I'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and UV lens filter )at lensmateonline.com.

Prior to the purchase, none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture. No one told me, but I wanted to tell you. This is not the same thing as a film camera.  And while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs... they haven't got all the bugs worked out just yet.Most of the time, my G3 is a well-behaved camera. But once in a while, I run up against it's major flaw: It sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time AFTER you press the shutter button.  I am not talking milliseconds.  Picture this: Your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board, so you compose the shot and wait for your moment. When it arrives, you press the shutter release. Splash! The moment passes, and THEN your new G3 camera takes the shot.  Perhaps there is a way around this delay.  Some feature I could turn on or off, or some attachment I could get... Yes, I push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay. Yes, I have red-eye off, and yes, I've tried adding a flash. But after trying many adjustments, the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera.  I own another Canon - an EOS (35mm film) camera. It focuses in a snap. Dim or bright, it would never take a picture AFTER the birthday candles had blown out, AFTER the Tae Kwon Do kick broke the board... Canon's G3 does it consistently.  It feels slow to focus, and unbearably slow to shoot.  I challenge anyone (who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon) to say it is fast and responsive.And so I must ask, what are cameras for? What task do they perform?Cameras capture moments. They stop time. Because once the moment is gone, it is not coming back. The dive, the kick, the blow-out-the-candles moments are, to me, the reason for cameras. A 35mm film camera captures the moments you want, while these digital cameras (my friends now inform me) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture. Not all the time, but often enough to be a real problem.  Like I said, when the moment is gone, it is GONE. So buy the G3.  Buy it for fun, for lack of processing, because you want to use iPhoto, or whatever.  But do not assume, as I did, that the G3 has the same ability as [your current film camera] to stop the moment YOU choose.  From a dime store disposable to a top of the line EOS, all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to.  Unfortunately, this digital moment-capturing device called the G3 sometimes captures the moment AFTER the one you wanted.", "Date": "March 20, 2003"}, {"Title": "Simply amazing", "Author": "asiafish \"asiafish\"", "ReviewID": "RKYIRFARETZ1Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The G3 is simply an amazing digital camera.  It offers all of the creative features a serious photographer could ask for, in a camera that when set to automatic, is simple enough for anyone to use.The fast lens means that the flash isn't needed as often as with other cameras, while the hot shoe allows an external flash for when flash is needed.  External flash is ALWAYS better than built-in, especially one with bounce capability (the Canon 420EX is a great companion to the G3).The Powershot G3 is NOT small and light enough to dissappear into a pocket, but that is part of what makes it such a terrific camera.  If you want a carry anywhere model, look at the Digital Elph or the S45/S50, which are much smaller and have built-in lens caps.  The G3, on the other hand, is made for using, not carrying.  That's not to say that its heavy and large, it is actually about the same size as most 35mm point and shoot cameras of the early 1990s.The larger size is what makes the G3 great.  It has a proper hand grip, that fast 4X zoom lens (physically a lot larger than the slow 3X lenses on other Canon cameras) and a large, tilt-swivvle LCD.  There are also enough buttons, dials and controls to make all of the G3's many features easy to access and use, rather than burrying them deep in the menu system.Some users complain that the lens barrel can be seen in the optical viewfinder when set to wide angle.  Yes, it can be seen, and no, it isn't that big of a deal.  If you've ever used a 35mm rangefinder camera you are probably familiar with this effect, and if you haven't, it isn't at all hard to get used to.Finally, the 4 megapixel resolution and accurate color balancce make for incredible images.  Automatic does a terrific job in most conditions, and when it doesn't, or you just want to be creative, you have more options with this camera than almost anything else on the market.I also own the 5 megapixel S50 as my compact camera.  I was concerned when I bought it that I would favor it over the G3 on account of hte higher resolution, however I just printed some 11X14s from both cameras, and resolution is not an issue on either one.  I see the extra resolution simply as more room to crop, which can make up for the S50 having a 3X as opposed to 4X zoom lens.  With the G3, I have more control over composition in the camera, doubly so as I also have the 17X Canon teleconverter.  With the functional equivalent of a 285mm lens on a 35mm camera, I honestly don't need much cropping, whereas the S50 is limited to 105mm and I often crop more.  Color saturation and accuracy are excellent on both cameras, and both are tack-sharp without any noise, at least if left at ISO 50 or 100 as I always do.In conclusion, I love the G3, and give it my highest recommendation.", "Date": "November 11, 2003"}, {"Title": "Probably the best prosumer digital camera", "Author": "T. Uy-Tioco \"Just me\"", "ReviewID": "R170TPAJTMM2BZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this in September 2003 and am extremely satisfied with its performance.  Originally I thought of getting a G5 but decided against it after reading negative reviews on [...] which by the way is an excellent source of digital camera information.  Apparently the G5 suffers from severe purple fringing due to trying to \"push\" the abilities of its small CCD sensor to its limits.  The effect is also apparent in a lot of other 5MP cameras that still use a 1/1.8\" size CCD.Anyway the G3 is extremely great!  Image quality is extremely high and since I don't print anything larger than A4 size, I don't need anything more than 4 megapixels.  Controls are very intuitive but browsing through the manual helps to learn a lot of the advanced features.  There are a lot of extra stuff that can definitely enhance one's photo experience (for example, there's a built-in neutral density filter to darken bright scenes and help saturate colors more).  There is also an optional lens adapter that lets you attach 58mm filters (something available on Canon's \"A\" series Powershots as well).  In fact, short of not having an interchangable lens, the G3 is practically a baby SLR camera!  Size, though it bothers some people, is not a problem for me because it actually gives the G3 a good feel in the hand.If you need the extra pixels, I suggest you skip the G5 and go straight for Canon's new Digital Rebel (EOS-300D).  Otherwise the G3 is an excellent performer for everyday use with a heaping of extra creativity when needed.  I now intend to get my G3 housed for underwater use, sell off my Nikon 35mm camera & kit, and continue to purchase Canon's photo & imaging products.Conclusion: if you are after a non-SLR type digital camera and will be doing more than point-and-shoot, I highly recommend the Powershot G3.

To do anything useful you have to take the time to convert your photos to JPG anyway.  I gave up on RAW after the first couple of tries and have stuck with JPG format since then.In summary...

I'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap, I may damage the lens.  Very cheaply made.2) The body construction - buttons, casing, etc, are too prastic.  The G2 was better in this respect.

It has a ton of advanced features and it's incredibly durable. I have dropped it a few times, and accidently got it wet and guess what, it still works. Also, it satisfies pretty much any kind of photographer. Switch to Auto and your grandma can use it, switch to any of the manual settings and it will satisfy the creative photographer. The focus, white balance, aperture, shutter speed, etc, can all be manually altered. Four mega-pixels might seem like a low number considering that high end compact digitals today have 5, 6 or more. But, 4 is more than enough to produce wonderful full-page prints. Also, because it's a 4 megapixel, it processes the photos very quickly, in about a second. Worried that it's not a digital SLR? Well, unless you're a pro photographer, you wouldn't mind simply getting one of the lens attachments such as Wide Angle, Zoom or Micro. I have the Wide Angle attachment I bought from a 3rd party on ebay for $50 and it works great with the camera, it has a built in macro lens as well.Anyway, if you want a compact digital, this is IT.

The G3 and the G5 are physically and optically identical - save for the G3's silver case that now comes in black. For the few extra hundred bucks you get a 5 MP rather than a 4 MP camera - a difference that's essentially indistinguishable except with poster sized prints. I opted for the far less costly G3 and have been delighted. The lens (4X zoom) is first class; the battery lasts for hundreds of shots between charges; the swivel LCD has gorgeous colors and is very solidly hinged; you can use it as a point-and-shoot with great results, yet have dozens of manual adjustments available if you desire more control; the macro feature (down to 2\" proximity) and the neutral density filter (to reduce exposure of very bright scenes) are worth the extra money alone.The one con is that the big lens obscures a corner of the optical viewfinder at the wide-angle setting -- but that's why you have an LCD viewer anyhow. Well worth paying a bit more than for a simple handheld camera; beatifully crafted, with excellent printed and illustrated manuals and first-class software.ADDENDUM: The current Powershot G5, a G3 in black drag with a 5 MP rather than a 4 MP CCD sensor, has received consistent criticism for showing chromatic aberration (\"haloing\") and digital noise when compared with the G3; probably because the higher density CCD feeds into the same electronics processing package as the G3. All the more reason to purchase the G3 - if you still can find one.

It's great to be able to toggle between the metering evaluation settings and see the results of the changes on the LCD screen.2) 4MP is about right for the target market of this camera (semi-serious amateur photographer)3) 4x zoom is nice4) The great thing about digital, in general, is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the LCD screen BEFORE or RIGHT AFTER you take a picture, not two weeks later when you get the film developed.5) Its focusing system is also very flexible. you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button, and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus.---------------NEGATIVES1) Quite bulky (it's about the same size as my Minolta Vectis S-1 APS SLR) and uses a heavy battery.2) Not very ergonomical - you'll find yourself stretching your fingers in the weirdest ways to get to some buttons (especially the flash toggle and exposure evaluation buttons at the top-left of the back)3) Len's aperture is not very flexible (it seems that it's range is very small, even for a point-and-shoot lens)4) The viewfinder is borderline worthless and, inexplicably and ridiculously, the lens blocks part of the viewfinder at the wide-angle.

The G3 is more on the expensive side of the spectrum, but it is definitely worth the investment.  I would consider myself to be an amateur photographer, but I could never really take high quality photos.  After taking a weekends worth of pictures at the standard default resolutions, I loaded the pictures onto my PC and was absolutely blown away by how nice they were.  The quality of the image, the resolution, and the color were all breath-taking.  From close-up head shots to landscape shots, they were all the kind of pictures that you looked at and just said \"Wow, that's a really nice picture.\" The combination optical/digital zoom is pretty impressive as well and is more than you will likely need (I could zoom in and read license plate numbers from cars parked in the background). So I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking to improve the pictures they take...you definitely won't be disappointed.  Aside from that, the software was easy to install and surprisingly well designed, camera interface is fairly easy to understand, workmanship of the camera is high quality (doesn't feel like a toy).  It is a little larger than most digital cameras, which I actually like.  It would probably be a tight fit into a small pants pocket, but fits easily in a larger cargo pocket.Only bad sides were that 1)The CF card that comes with it is a paltry 32Mb, so look into getting something bigger and 2)Doesn't come with a case.

However, while I was stationed in Iraq the camera suffered from an E24 error while it was with my wife in Germany. I chose not to take the camera to Iraq out of fear that it would be damaged. Instead, to my suprise, it was damaged in Germany for no apparant reason, atleast not one due to poor handling. My wife mailed the camera to the Canon repair shop in the States. They returned the camera in working order. The repairs were completed free of charge since it was in the time period of the one year warranty. On the day I returend from Iraq (6 months later after the first repair) a friend took a photo of us at the reception ceremony. The camera relapsed into the same state as before - an E24 error. The LCD screen would not display any data. The camera therefore completely shut itself off, a feature that was later explained to me by a Canon representative that is used to protect the camera from further damage. I spoke with a repair representative about what appears to me to be an easy fix. I was told that since my warranty had expired I would have to pay a minimum of $187 to a maximum of $500 for the repairs. Keep in mind this was told to me prior to any Canon technician ever even looked at the camera. I asked if that would still be the charge if it was a fix as simple as a loose screw and they told me that was an accurate assumption. I then asked if I would be required to pay if it was found that the problem was related to the initial repair having not been done properly while under warranty, again they responded that I would. They then informed me of an \"Upgrade Program\". They told me I could send them my G3, and pay them an additional $300, and in return I would receive a REFURBISHED G5! Not a new one, REFURBISHED! If I were to accept that offer I would end up paying $950 for a refurbished Canon G5 ($300 + the original $650 for the G3). I was insulted to say the least. I'm willing to bet that those refurbished G5's are part of a program that they have for an upgrade to the G6 for the G5 users that have the same issue as I. What a scam! What a pathetic customer service department! What an insult to an American soldier that just returned from a 13 month deployment in Iraq!

Because this camera is beautiful. The G2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely.  The G3 looks like a work of art! Its silver magnesium finish is stunning, and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera I've seen.
