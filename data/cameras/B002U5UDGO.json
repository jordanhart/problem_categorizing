CONS on this unit is the range and the crank timer had to be reset twice. overall its nice but i depend on mine alot so im going back to autopage and viper.UPDATE:BRAIN ON STARTER STOP WORKING ALARM STILL WORKS FINE BUT THE REMOTE START DOES NOT.its only been 5 months!! im highly disappointed in this product and will not buy again.back to AUTOPAGE.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Superb remote start/alarm", "Author": "BrandonU", "ReviewID": "R4Y7JBOXIIOU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this a couple years ago from another retailer (sorry Amazon) for our '99 Suburban 2500.  I loved it so much I purchased it's twin AVITAL 5303L Security/Remote Start System for our Yukon XL.  Fairly easy to install if you are familiar with automotive alarms and remote starts, but if you are new to this, I'd suggest finding an installer.  Tons of useful features on this unit. 2-way communications means the vehicle will signal your remote when your vehicle is tampered with.  Will also show on your remote the vehicle current status, including if your doors are locked, and can even show you the temp inside the vehicle.  Remote can also be used as an alarm clock.  Great range (will work from across a parking lot easily).It even has a sensor that can be programmed to automatically turn on your defroster during remote start when it is cold out.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Remote and alarm system", "Author": "Muad Nagi", "ReviewID": "R1CI9KCL3DAJAY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great product the only thing is it doesnt remote start from very long distance.
