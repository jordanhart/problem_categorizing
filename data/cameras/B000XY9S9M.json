But I need to replace my old cameras. I bought a 480L camera for very cheap price. But its quality is bad. It did not worth to return it since the price is so low. So I decided to buy a better one, and selected this mid-price camera.This camera was too surprise to me, it only take 3 days to my door, in perfect condition. It is very solidly built and performs great. The build-in 36 infrared leds is very bright in the darkness. I totally believe the night vision is clear and bright at greater than 100 feet. This IR camera is a GENUINE night vision camera. I could get CLEAR high resolution monitoring in just start light and street lights. We can see color image in the day time, clear black and white image in the night.And I can zoom this camera to get different view angle as needed.Highly recommended.", "Date": "March 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "the night vision sucks", "Author": "HWEI YING YEN", "ReviewID": "R30WD4DJP0WA7P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The night vision on this camera really sucks. I compared this camera with the previously installed seventy dollar camera (VideoSecu Color Security Vandal Proof Dome Camera 1/3\" Sony CCD 480 TVL 3.6 mm Lens) and the cheaper camera worked far better with better video quality than this camera. I almost couldn't see anything with this camera at dark. I have decided to return this camera, it's not worth the price, go with the cheaper one I mentioned.", "Date": "July 1, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$329.95", "Features": "Built-in 1/3\" Sony Super HAD CCD; Color DSP;Automatic CDS sensor;540 TV Lines Horizontal Resolution\n0 Lux ( IR LED ON); Signal to Noise Ratio: More than 48dB\nAluminum Housing for outdoor indoor application\nIR LED Wave length: 850 nm; Built in 4~9mm Varifocal Manual\nPower Requirement: 12V DC Regulated 500mA(sold separately)", "Name": "VideoSecu Outdoor Built-in 1/3\" Sony CCD Dome Security Camera Day Night Vision 540TVL 36 IR Infrared Leds 4-9mm Zoom Focus Lens for Home CCTV DVR Surveillance System 1LE", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4186UPsrbDL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000XY9S9M"}}
