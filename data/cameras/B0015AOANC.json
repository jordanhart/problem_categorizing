{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome Camera!", "Author": "Mary E. \"Emilee\"", "ReviewID": "R3RD3N1JTXMU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera (well, the silver version) on discount at Target for around $90. After all the other cameras I tried that sucked (HP, Kodak) I really liked this one! I don't feel it necessary to go into great detail because everything it says it does above is true and works well. And yes it takes video clips with sound AND you can hear it during playback on the camera. (That's the question I always have, but no one ever answers it.) Anyway, I loved this camera until someone stole it! Now I have to replace it with a new one, but it's worth it. But if you don't want to take my word for it, just look at the reviews of the pink version of this camera (they're basically the same). I'm not sure why there weren't any reviews for this black version, but there's at least one now! Thanks for reading.", "Date": "June 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera for the price!", "Author": "M. Kinch \"chaoticpi\"", "ReviewID": "R2LCD8ZX9RJM88", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have dropped this camera on numerous occasions. Sometimes to the point of the battery chamber opening and spilling the batteries. It has sprung marveously back to life. It's great.The pictures are awesome, detailed and great for a 7.0 mp camera. You have the feature of being able to crop and zoom on the pictures while the camera's still in use.It's weak without a steady light with the thing in video format, however the video is still good.Definitely reccomend buying reuseable batteries, as this burns through them quickly depending on the usage.", "Date": "November 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pleasent Surprise", "Author": "Dasher \"marbleann\"", "ReviewID": "RYX7ANGVWWWY3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was moving to Houston from NY and was driving there. Well of course somehow my cameras was packed away in the truck which I found out when I saw some sites I wanted to take pictures of. So we pulled off the Highway and ended up in a Walgreens and this was on sale. I figured I have 3 digital camera's already so the last thing I needed was to spend a lot of money on another one. Well guess what this camera is the best camera I ever had!  I was in shock. When I got to really sit down and read about the camera I was surprised what it had to offer. Polaroid needs to advertise this camera a lot more. People tend to think of the old Polaroid type cameras and probably do not even know they make digital cameras.I would recommend this camera to anybody who is a casual picture taker. You can't go wrong. The only problem is that in my move I lost the usb cable and my other camera's cables are not compatible.", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Polaroid Camera", "Author": "Jennifer L.

I have failed.  No matter what settings I use, sometimes I get fantastic shots, and other times I get crap, even after repeated tries at the same picture.  Daytime shots are \"usually\" good, but still unreliable.  The flash is blindingly bright, no matter what setting is used, so night shots are horrible.  No matter how many different settings I try (and I've tried every possible combination), I cannot get this camera to give me consistently good pictures.  I'm an artist, and there are some shots I want detail to be in, and this camera just doesn't really give me options.  It was cheap, and just as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for.  I should have paid a little bit more and bought another Canon.  I really hate this camera.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "OK, as long as you don't plan to use it", "Author": "Jeremy Epstein", "ReviewID": "R1ZRCTD5TXLJ7A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this unit for my 10 year old because it was cheap.  After a couple weeks, one of the sensors failed and all the pictures came out with a purple tinge.  Got that replaced under warranty.  The replacement unit just failed - after about six months - it'll move the lens in and out, but just blinks its little light... and the manual, which was clearly never proofread by an English speaker, doesn't provide any useful hints.
