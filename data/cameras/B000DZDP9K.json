{"Reviews": [{"Title": "For the price - excellent", "Author": "Lenny", "ReviewID": "R2RP0QBO6L3FT8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my parents - who are not tech / gadget lovers, to put it mildly.It is very easy to use, the automatic mode is fine most of the time, the power and zoom buttons is a little fiddly, not something I noticed until I was giving the parents the \"how to use it\" lesson! This is not to say that they are difficult, just that some people might find them hard to use. It does what it is designed to do.The photos are clear and sharp, colour reproduction is Ok - sometimes colours are more vibrant than in real life, but mostly this is subtle enough to just make the photos more intersting and visually appealing. (People's skin looks better - so it can be quite flattering!!!!) 5MP is easily enough for good quality prints and enlargements. With a 1/2 Gb card, you can just set the default to the highest quality and forget about it. It will store 100's of photos in that format.The body feels a little plastic - I have a Canon Power shot SD500 which feels a lot more solid, (but cost about $200 more) and the time lag between taking shots is a little longer with the HP (with flash - can be 2 - 3 seconds), but I think that it is a great buy for the price.AA batteries are great - especially for people who might be prone to forgetting to charge a battery for that special event.The main reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was that I did not like the software that came with it. Editing the photos an rotating photos to display appropriately was not intuitive. Certainly not when compared to the software that came with the Canon. Admittedly, I did not spend a lot of time with the software, so maybe I just didn't see the obvious..........I got a Kingston 512 MB Secure Digital Card (SD/512)for about $14 - and I am delighted with it. I can't believe the price of SD memory in the US. (I'm from Europe - I would expect to pay easily 3 - 4 times that in Europe). It works, there's not a lot else to say about it. It's not a high speed card, but with this camera, a high speed card would be a waste (I put a high speed card into it from my Canon and it didn't make a noticeable difference to the time lag between shots, so I assume it is the processor that is the main cause of the delay).If you buy it, get rechargable batteries, also - the bag they suggest is expensive... I got a Targus bag (Targus DLUC02 Universal Camera Leather Case - Black  )  which does the job - it does make it too big to fit in your pocket - but you will want space to carry round the extra batteries!!!!In conclusion, this is a very very good first time digital camera. The downsides are the feel of the camera (plastic) and the lag required between shots. It is heavy on batteries, but given that there are rechargable batteries on the market - that doesn't matter so much. I didn't think the software supplied was good, but I note that others think it is, so maybe I didn't give it enough time.Would I buy it for my parents again?

The camera worked great up until about a week ago.  She had it in her purse and noticed it was extremely hot to the touch.  She took it to an adult to look at it and they removed the batteries and allowed it to cool.  When we got it home, we put new batteries in it and tried to turn it on.  It would not come on so we sat it down to see if it would heat up again.  Within seconds it began to get hotter and hotter so we took the batteries out and noticed that the batteries were not hot.I contact HP to see about getting it replaced.  Of course they refuse to replace it because i am passed my 90 day warranty period.  I for one could not believe they only have a 90 warranty but I was even more shocked they were not concerned about it heating up.I would be interested to know how many others have or will experience this problem as it may help my case.

There aren't a lot of dials, settings, etc to confuse the issue too much. She loves the video feature, although you have to transfer the files to your computer to hear the sound on the video. Video quality is only so-so, and jumpy, but for what she'll use it for, its fine. A minor detail. Battery life seems good, although I have switched her to rechargables now!

All the basic functions are there in this lightweight, basic compact camera. The icons are easily understood and onboard graphic additions like frames can be fun. It doesn't seem to go through batteries as fast as other digital cameras I have. It's also super easy to transfer images and videos to my computer, with or without HP's Photosmart software (I actually prefer Google's freeware, PicasaII, to transfer and catalog images much more quickly).I keep it in my purse, and often pull it out to snap something or to show off my pictures, clearly visible in the 1.7\" digital screen, to friends and co-workers (hey, if I have to look at their kids and grandkids pics, then they have to ooooh and aaahhhh over my pretty pet portraits!).The only gripe I have is having to reset the date with battery changes (in the few instances I actually wanted a date-stamp on my photos).", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "pansy", "Author": "H.

The camera is small and functional, and overall is a fairly good value for the money; but there are a few BASIC features that it is MISSING.  Most noteably, this camera does NOT have a viewfinder.  You must use the LCD display as the viewfinder.  If the LCD would happen to break, the camera would be completely useless.
