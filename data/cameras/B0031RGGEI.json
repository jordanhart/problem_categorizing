We wanted a decent camera for him for under $100, and this more than met our expectations!It takes GREAT pictures! And, my son has figured out so many things about it (panoramic shots for one), that I wanted one of my own.I love that it has a rechargeable battery that you can just recharge by plugging in the wall.I'm a picture freak and take our camera to a lot of events for my children (cc races mainly, art festivals, games), and this is so much lighter to tote around (I like to carry it in a little cross-body bag) especially in the hot weather.Love it!

Right out of the gate, one of the first things you'll notice is it's size, which is small to say the least.  I've got a Blackberry 8330, and it's much smaller than the 8330 is.  Secondly, you'll immediately notice how quick this phone is to turn on.  It will only be a second or 2 after hitting the power button that the phone is on, and immediately ready to take beautiful pictures.  The quality of all the pictures I've taken thus far are great, and I've not had any problems.  I will say, make sure to press the button half way, then fully push the button and take the shot.  If you quickly press the button all the way, the camera will most likely not take a picture that's focused.

It took blurry pictures many of the times and required a long time to get a good focused picture. If you did manage to get something you had to wait 4-5 seconds and \"that moment\" rarely will wait that long for the picuture to look ok.There were three occasions that the picutes were loaded from the camera to my computer. The first two times worked fine, but on the third time the camera failed. It just stopped working and now will not turn on, it flashes the light next to the power button and ends there. Less than three months and it is gone. I will be stuck across seas for the last month with no way to get pictures I guess. Hopefully I can find something that will work in the states when I get back.I had an 8MP camera from kodak as well, it lasted a bit longer and took ok pictures, but also had issues with length of time you had to wait to take a good pitcure. The 8MP camera also just randomly stopped working as well. This is a you get what you pay for I guess, will probably avoid Kodak from now on.

He loves the fact that this camera is pocket-size.  He loves taking it everywhere, snapping pics of birds, family, anything he finds interesting.  The really big down side to this camera is it is pocket-size.  :)  Since I believe that the owner of the pants or shorts should clean out his/her own pockets, I don't do it before throwing them in the washing machine.  After I discovered the camera in the bottom of the washing machine, I was absolutely certain it was done.  I researched online and discovered that I had probably done further damage by trying to turn it on.  Although I didn't have much hope, I took out the battery, the SD card, and left the little \"door\" open.  I put the camera, the battery, and the card in a bowl of rice (completely covered) for two or three days.  At the end of that time frame, I put the card and battery back in the camera and miracle of all miracles it worked!Thinking that our son had learned his lesson, imagine my shock a couple of months later to discover same said camera once again in the bottom of the washing machine.  After pitching a really big fit and telling our son he would have to buy his next camera, I tried the rice trick once again.  Once again, the camera and SD card survived.  The battery didn't make it through the second time, but I wasn't terribly upset because I just couldn't believe how well the camera itself had held up.  The replacement battery was expensive, though, so I thought twice before buying it.I am actually looking at buying another one because the first one has finally met its demise.  My now 9-year-old son was taking a picture when he was hit from behind over the weekend and dropped the camera onto a limestone floor.  That hit, on the front side of the camera, finished it off.

This camera is basic, but decent. Nothing extraordinary about it.  The screen is pretty big and it takes decent pictures.  The camera also has numerous camera settings to choose from.  This camera is true definition of point and shoot. Major drawback I found with it is that it takes approximately 2-3 seconds after a picture has been taken to take another one thus=slow. The battery life isn't as long as other point and shoots as well.  Overall I would give it a 3 or 3 1/2.

I use it mainly for close-ups of plants and flowers and for short-distance display shots, so others that use it for other reasons may have a different experience. One of my main beefs is poor color rendition in the SmartCapture mode. Even in Flower mode, yellows are too bright, saturated, and sickly. You have to go through the Menu to get into Macro mode, something I use all the time. I didn't realize how convenient a button for it directly on the back of the camera is until I didn't have one anymore.Picture quality in general is my second problem. Often, they just aren't crisp. I don't have the photographic vernacular to describe exactly what the problem is so let's just leave it at: the pictures suck a good portion of the time. The light rendering isn't good or the focus was weird. While my old Canon Powershot rarely let me down in this regard, the Kodak does so with regularity.Last, I hate the buttons on top. You have Power, Flash, Menu and Shutter release buttons all in a row, very small and flush to the top of the camera.

This one, though, has been a continual disappointment.  Since day one, about 75% of the pics I take are out of focus, even though the subject and camera are still.  I've even sent it back to Kodak and they replaced the entire lens but it still is not up to the quality I had come to expect with the first two Kodak cameras.  I have even resorted to using my older Kodak again instead, which worked fine but just was older and has a small view screen -- but at least it takes pictures that are in focus!", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Horrid", "Author": "jennifer griffithe", "ReviewID": "R2FJARDTVI7FWB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The KODAK M530 is the worst.
