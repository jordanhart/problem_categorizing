It takes such good pictures that I was afraid to get it wet at first! I ended up taking it on 3 different snorkeling trips and it did great! Takes wonderful underwater pictures and video! I am so happy I got this camera!", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great waterproof camera.", "Author": "Alan R  Smith", "ReviewID": "RWZ2U3VSGSAMZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Delivered on time.  Takes great pictures.  Has a mode for everything.  HD video is also very good. 5x zoom could be more but you can't have everything.  Used it in the Bahamas down to 15 feet and no leaks.  Have to remember to wipe water droplets off the lense after surfacing.  Would buy it again.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "KLD", "ReviewID": "R3PB25CI2DYFFZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Works well underwater and out of water.

Or dive into a pool with it.  We bought the camera for the underwater still photo ability but some other features have been a pleasant surprise.  Such as:*The write-speed is much faster than I anticipated.*The LCD screen is sharp, clear, and a great size.*The video capability is a nice bonus.*The battery life is up to a full day of activity.The one thing I have learned is DOWNLOAD PHOTOS BEFORE CHARGING THE CAMERA.  Or, take the card out of the camera during charging.  We learned the hard way that charging with the card in the camera creates problems.  Thank goodness for Card Raider.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cool camera", "Author": "Fernando", "ReviewID": "RP3OWIXTZM986", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a pretty cool all weather camera. Dont need to worry if you drop it on the water or floor. This camera can take a beating. So far I had this camera for a month and pretty much enjoying it. Will take it with me for our family cruise to the Bahamas. The pictures are nice and the video its 7/10. The camera has a ton of cool features such HDR.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "12MP BSI CMOS\n5x wide Zoom\n3.0\" 460k LCD\n1080p HD Video", "Name": "Olympus Tough TG-620 iHS", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pZQW8CL0L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00763EPZK"}}
