{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worth every penny, the best for the \"affordable\" CCTV systems", "Author": "P. Killion", "ReviewID": "R7946FGBGVF7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "***Update 8/27/2012***The system is still working fantastic. The image is crisp and clear, even after purchasing I still did a lot of research, and everything about this system is quality for the price. The sensors in the cameras are larger than many of the wireless systems you'll see (such as Logitech) which only have a 1/5\" sensor, these are 1/4\" which is why you get a sharper picture (as well as a better recording res and framerate due to the better DVR). The recording on the DVR is great, it's recording quality is really nice, I can clearly make out individuals while watching. Still keep the DVR up in the attic in 105 degree weather (I did add a small fan nearby at least) and still working great; eventually I will probably make a locking cabinet in our master closet for it.Also, I did in fact finally hook up the system to my network, I was planning on running CAT 6 througout the house, just haven't gotten to it, so instead I hooked it up to this little refurbished product: NETGEAR WNCE2001 Universal WiFi Internet Adapter - Manufacturer Refurbished. I like being able to watch it on my HTPC on occasion, the system can also be adjusted/configured over the network (takes a little longer due to screen refreshes, but not much longer). All in all, I'm so glad I ordered this kit! I had originally ordered this kit elsewhere for a little bit cheaper, but even at this price I think I'd still do it, if you're getting a security system, it needs to be stable/secure for you to feel at ease.***Original Review***My car had been broken into twice in the past 6 months from right outside my door, plus we also had some vandalism (drunk teens through a ziplock bag of vomit at our front door, stained the concrete, won't come up). Figured enough was enough, I don't like feeling unsecure in my own house, so I decided to purchase a CCTV security system.At first I debated on a break-in type security system, but having indoor dogs means the motion-sensor type won't cut it, and the window/door systems are difficult to setup (or of poor quality if you use a major security dealer to setup); just an aside, over 98% of calls from those security systems are false alarms (I work in public safety), and those systems drive everyone in the safety sector nuts since they are so unreliable. Anyways, figured a CCTV system was fairly easy to install, fairly cheap as well, and has the benefit of both being preventative (burglers/vandals are less likely to take action when they see cameras, one of the benefits of camera systems), and if they do decide to take action, you're also more likely to catch those individuals (most criminals are stupid and don't wear masks or other concealing devices). In fact, you can even talk to your local law enforcement, because they'll probably be able to recognize the culprit without inputting them into any system, since most are repeat offenders, but again, getting off track here.So I purchased the Aposonic 4 camera/DVR system because it seemed to have the best reviews looking around the web (I never look at one single place for large purchases). The Zmodo systems seem to have very mixed reviews, and while all the systems look similar, the internal components, and even the firmware put into the DVR, makes all the difference. I can say the Aposonic won't blow you away with its quality, but its solid, reliable and proven technology.I mounted the cameras on the eves of my roof so they would get some protection from the elements (yes they are rated for exterior use, but always take that with a grain of salt for sub-$600 systems); the installation was easy since I screwed into wood, just attach the 3 screws, then screw the camera onto the base, tweak to the right angle, about as easy as it gets. I ran the cables along the inside of the eves and into a vent hole for the roof (I don't like drilling through stucco), taped up the connection points with high quality electrical tape (to protect from rust and secure the connection) and drilled some cord hangers to route the cords. Getting the cords routed through the attic was the hardest part (small house doesn't have a huge slope, gets to about 6in clearance towards the end of the roof), used some grabber arms (fish tape works better). One thing if routing through the attic, always run the wires perpindicular to any other electrical wires if you must cross them, it minimizes the contact point, never run them parallel or else you'll get interference in the signal. Connected them to the DVR which I have in the attic (hope it doesn't get too hot, but so far so good in 90+ degree weather), and connected an old Sony CRT monitor via VGA.The menu system is a little funky, but for a cheap system, hands down better than the competitors. Most everything is straight forward to access, you can use the included mouse, the front of the dvr, or the remote control, so you're not limited in using the system. The picture quality is pretty darn good, with a good framerate it looks like you're watching a SD camcorder, none of that 10fps garbage where people jump across the screen. The night vision is of pretty good quality, the IR works pretty well for I'd say up to 20 ft, and decent for a little beyond that, plus the camera is smart in taking in both well lit and dark areas simultaneously (I was worried since there is a porch light right next to one of the cameras, but that doesn't seem to interfere).The one thing I plan on hooking up this weekend and haven't been able to test has been the networking aspect; I'm sure its not plug and play, so you will have to know some networking aspects to get it up, but the menu had a very comprehensive set of settings you can adjust to get it running on any network setup. I'll update once I get that up and running.All in all, I'm totally impressed; the price is a little higher than some of the cheaper systems, but saving yourself the headache is worth it.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "A lot better than expected!

The picture quality is excellent, especially for the price. I have friends who install these types of systems all the time, in the alarm company business, and they couldn't even come close to the price of this system. I have worked with Video surveillance systems in the past, and the USB flash drive backup is a great feature. With a 320GB hard drive, you will get a couple of weeks of video that you can review.

I think it's not the right business mode I should do and I need to educate my clients what a decent surveillance system can give them.I read many reviews, did some research, and decided to try this system.Finally I got this one which allowed me stay away from hassles.After testing 3 months, I've recommend it to my friends and customers who really want to see something at night.The menu and settings are very easy to figure out, and so is the installation.Connect it with my router, set the net type at DHCP and get an IP from router, login to router to do the portforwarding (I opened mine at port 81), memorize my internal and external IPs, and then I can monitor my home anytime anywhere.The small cameras output color and vivid image in day time, sharp and clear image in night time. Due to the size and number of LED, you may see about 20-30 ft. at night.The app on App store is free and simple to use. One of my friends came to my house and was surprised by my surveillance system which delivered such better image and reliable networking than his. (his system was 1/2 of $299.99 I spent) I was told 2 weeks later he sold his old one and got the same one as I have.  I also bought another camera Aposonic A-CDBI09B 420TVL Sharp CCD Indoor/Outdoor All Weather CCTV Surveillance Camera for my front door.Conclusively, I bought the system to test for my business and gave it positive word of mouth.I personally just use cameras above 650 TVL. However, for common needs, just spend a bit more and try this one.

It includes everything needed to setup 4 cameras, and installation was a breeze. An actual user manual would have been nice (installation was all pictures), but after unpacking everything it was pretty obvious how to put the unit together.The included installation CD has all kinds of useful software on it, including the most important software CMS which is needed to view the camera's on your computer or easily through the internet. The installation CD did not, however, have any kind of autostart function or any \"guide\" as most users are accustomed to seeing as soon as an installation cd is placed in the computer, so this is a negative point. It took me all of five minutes to figure out, but someone a little less savvy might not get as far as quickly.I did have to look up how to setup the security camera network, because there was absolutely no guidance anywhere on the screen. I also needed to pay an electrician $550 dollars to install the unit on my 3 bedroom 2 story unit, but it was probably more than typical installation cost due to the difficulty involved in routing wires around in my extremely old house. Nothing to do with the product really, just something to factor in if you aren't planning on doing this yourself (I started and gave up).", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "AG", "ReviewID": "R2T3LEBWUR2O7B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Product and a must buy!!!!A very clear quality item this is well worth the money!!!!!Will order second one for friend.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Remote viewing does not work anymore.....", "Author": "D.
