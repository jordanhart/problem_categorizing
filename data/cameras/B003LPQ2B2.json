I paid about the same as I did for the Kodak online, about $50 or $60.  The Kodak was actually a very nice little camera for the price, and I hoped the Vivitar X018 would do about as well.  In short, NOT!!!  This is a very strange product, really more a toy camera, but to me almost seems like a fake product.  It has all the electronic features you'd expect in a real camera.  However, it seems to be missing the most important feature of any camera:  a LENS.  It claims to have a \"digital lens\".  My guess looking at it is that it's a pin-hole lens, or very nearly so.  Anyhow, whatever the cause, even under the most benign conditions, the image quality is simply appalling.  It doesn't matter if it has 10 Megapixels:  These images would look awful at VGA or NTSC resolution.  I am simply astounded at the difference between the Kodak and the Vivitar for the very same price.  Worst of all was the tragedy of hundreds of utterly worthless pictures my daughter took to capture a special family vacation.  In summary:  THIS IS NOT A REAL CAMERA.

In fact, I think the phone took better photos. Seriously, this camera is complete junk and a waste of your money.

This piece of junk Vivitar which I got in the mail this afternoon was so terrible I nearly smashed it on principal, instead of getting my money back, just so some poor sap won't just buy it again. (no issue with the seller or Amazon, I got it fast and in perfect condition).I took a picture on a tripod in a medium lit room with both these cameras and compared. The result was a great photo from my other camera and a picture that was equivalent to a 2MP photo that was enlarged to 10MP from the Vivitar. It uses every trick in the book to dither it up to the biggest blurry crappy photo it can.I understand this camera costs less than $50 and I'm never gonna try and compare it to an actual camera, which is why I'm comparing to my 4 year old 4MP Lumix which isn't a real camera either in my book. But if even my Virgin Mobile camera phone can take better photos then the XO18 then there's a problem! The reason I actually purchased this was so I can begin taking staging photos and test videos for some other project. I just needed a cheap camera to capture a low-medium quality video with sound and be able to take a picture and the flip screen seemed useful. The sound is muffled at best from 3 feet away, movements are choppy and when you blink the camera records it as your eyes being closed for a whole second. Also the sound is not synced with the video. This is while using a faster SDHC card.I think my point is clear and I agree with any other reviewers indicating this thing is terrible.

You do need to purchase batteries and a memory card which it does say on the box. My oldest loves that handy little flip screen so that you can take your own picture and video yourself. Thet are learning the settings quickly and are starting to take some pretty nice photos.Overall get to know the camara and learn what settings take the best pictures for what conditions. I would recommend reading the two books by Jim Miotke called The BetterPhoto Guide to Digital Photography. One is about digital camaras and the other is about taking better nature pictures.
