The LCD screen on back is very tiny and the image is not easy to see on it.  I didn't realize that I had to buy a separate memory card for this camera.  It only holds ONE photo without the memory card.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sigh.", "Author": "Vyxter", "ReviewID": "R1M1S1TNLGRABH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "What a painful disappointment.

My niece loves to take pictures and view them on the screen.

She was so disappointed when the only 2 pictures she was able to take were very grainy and unable to even determine what the picture was.  Then the camera just stopped working altogether.  It just kept staying frozen and when you tried to take a pic it never would work.  This camera is garbage!  It looks cute but definitely a waste.  We weren't able to send it back in time either so a COMPLETE waste of money and time!  What a disappointment for everyone!", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Really not worth it - should have listened to the reviews", "Author": "J.

We purchased this for my five year old niece, almost six. it was difficult to figure out even for us adults, the memory card can only be 1G which these days is near impossible to find. we had to dig up an old one of ours to use the camera. when we finally figured out it WILL NOT WORK without the 1G Memory card (even though it is suppose to) the pictures were horrible. Its cute product but really not up to today's standards.
