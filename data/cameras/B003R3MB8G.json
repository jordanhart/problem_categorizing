I am very new to photography, never done it before outside of a hobby. I did my research for days and based on the reviews + opinions from others, the Cannon T2i was a great camera for newbies and experts alike. I have been exploring this camera and reading up on tutorials, and it is honestly amazing. Of course a great camera doesn't automatically mean you'll take amazing shots (simply pointing and shooting does not equal a great photo, you WILL have to work on it), but it really is an awesome camera. It might seem intimidating to a newbie, what with all the buttons and etc., but you'll have a lot of fun learning about it and the books including in this kit at great as well. I have gotten decent at this camera and have taken some amazing photos - now I've got friends and strangers offering me money to take their photos. This camera is amazing and I suggest buying the camera if nothing else.The rest of the stuff that come with this kit are great as well. I don't know what the other reviews meant by saying this stuff was 'cheap'; I have been rough handling everything that came with it for months and I've been in the woods during tornado weather (seriously) and everything is still going strong. The carrying case is very sturdy, I keep the camera inside the case and put it in the trunk of my car. I drive like a bat out of hell and yet my camera still remains safe within the case. My two year old son has grabbed it and thrown it on the floor; my camera is still fine, that's how good the case is.As for the tripod, it is VERY sturdy. I think those who said it broke don't understand how to open the latches and lock them properly - something my brother did and almost broke it. If you know what you're doing, it will not break. it is very sturdy. As I said, I've taken it to the woods more than once, during windy weather and it stayed perfectly still.The little extras are a awesome - I went through the first battery and couldn't use my charger out in the woods. Thankfully this kit came with a backup, and trust me, you will need it. The cleaning kit also has come in handy numerous times. The SD card case is also another godsend that you don't realize you need until you actually need it. This kit is effing awesome!This seller's shipping was uber fast. Took like 3 days. Would have reviewed sooner but felt like I needed to use this a while to get a good honest opinion.Highly recommended!", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Complete Rip-off", "Author": "Amateur181 \"Amateur181\"", "ReviewID": "R3SZYJHWZFMM65", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is a great camera being compromised by a terrible accessory package and an unethical seller.

This item is perfect if we are not so concerned on the brand of the bag or tripod. It comes with an extra battery which impressed me alot. When we are outdoors an extra battery helps us keep going. It includes a 16GB SD Card, which is enough to shoot a small movie or 4000+ pictures and a tripod fills you with everything we need. Coming to the camera, it is simply wonderful. Canon T2i has everything we need for a beginner to professional photography. ISO Setting of 6400 gives us ability to shoot at a very low light. It supports quite a high shutter speed. I tried upto 1/1600 holding in hand. This package comes with 2 lens - 18-55mm and 70-300mm. It's also not that heavy as other DSLRs' so that makes it comfortable to carry outdoors. Last but not least, the seller emailed me couple of times to make sure I received everything properly and the items are working fine. This pro-active checking gives us a comfort level that we usually miss on online purchases.Overall I am impressed with this package and recommend this product and seller on Amazon.

I was excited and couldn't wait to get it and start snapping away! Four days after I purchased the item, I received it. Checked over the extras, and saw that while they weren't the same as the photo, they'd do for now. It was a good start. Then I checked the camera (base) and noticed that 3 essential parts within the camera had come loose and I couldn't use it. This wasn't the sellers fault - it looked like either a manufacturers error or due to shipping it got knocked loose. When I saw that my brand new camera was broken, it was late afternoon on Friday, I emailed the seller (through Amazon). I heard back from them on Sunday (mail back & they'll send another) shipped the camera immediately back on Tuesday. (Monday was a holiday) The seller received it on Thursday and unbeknownst to me, the seller shipped back the new one over night. So I missed the package on Friday. FINALLY on Monday I received my brand new, perfectly working camera. Through the entire ordeal, the seller was very helpful and felt sorry for the broken merchandise. Can't tell you how much I appreciated that, since I was about to cry when I noticed it was broken.*Side note* The first camera I received I named it Tabitha (I've named all the cameras I've owned). When I received the 2nd, I named her Tabitha Two.... T2. :)Wish I knew this before I purchased:- The only thing I was disappointed in was the bag I received. The one in the picture has side pockets and the one I received had none. It was a lot smaller than expected and could barely fit the 2 lenses & the camera, plus a couple extra little things. Would've liked a better description of exactly what I was getting, and not be fooled by the photo provided.Other than that, I was very happy with my purchase and the seller's help during the ordeal.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not at all a great deal........", "Author": "Vishalg", "ReviewID": "R3QI9HQCXH5GPA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wouldn't elaborate it a lot, just would like to say BUY things separately not in kit.

I always wanted a camera that would make 'professional' pictures, but the better ones have always been pretty pricey. I haven't paid much attention to a research of other brands, but i knew i wanted Canon, since my 2 previous digital cameras were Canon and i have always been pleased with the quality of the picture as well as the camera itself.As a newbie to DSLR, i didn't plan on spending more than 1,000 USD, and i wanted it to come as a kit, to have the basics taken care of already. Initially I was deciding between lower categories of Canon Rebel EOS up to T3i. I wanted 12+ MPix, possibly a HD video shooting, face detection, anti-shake, and at least 2 frames/sec...you know, those basic features you are thinking about when buying a DSLR.Photography has always been my passion, taking pictures on every day basis, at school, around town, on trips. But when i decided to give my photos additional dimension, depict the natural beauty, DSLR was the choice to make, asap.So i decided to go with the T2i, (being sold in Europe as EOS 550). T3i has the flip open LCD screen, which i regarded rather as a downside, since i didnt see it too practical after some usage. (i was worried the screen wont hold in place, would open by itself or might get damaged faster than the regular screen). Going to a higher levels: such as 5D or even 7D was inviting, but out of my price range for a newbie.I am no pro, i have owned this camera for over 8 months now, but i still haven't been able to try out all the features.The camera is amazing, takes great photos, and it is pretty sturdy in my hands. Pictures are 1000x better than the ones taken with the regular point and shoot camera. The most importantly, it gives general photography advanced look.When i get a little more familiar with my new toy (and save up some money), i will definitely invest into Macro lens, as i have always been interested in details.What i dislike is the camera bag that my kit included, i only use it to store my camera in when at home, i dont take it outside, as it is bulky and not very practical to carry around.Battery stays charged for a long time, and 16GBit is more than enough. Otherwise, when going on a vacation or a longer trip, i always bring my laptop, so i transfer photos immediately, and never run out of memory.I strongly recommend this camera, Canon never let me down :)", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love the Camera, Lenses and extras!", "Author": "Donna Rae Caporaso", "ReviewID": "RGBJB5RF664ZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No complaints.

Decided to try SLR and settled on Cannon Rebel T2i with 18MP, the main reason why gave up on camcorder and went to SLR, the huge mega pixels with video option.  I love the camera.  But there is one draw back.  Fond myself changing the lens so often that it became such a burden on the trip to Las Vegas/Hoover Dam.  With Sony HDR-SR12's powerful zoom, I could capture any surroundings without any hustle.  If not for 10.2 MP on still photos, I would have stayed with the camcorder.Right now I am looking to purchase a small pocket size camera with great zoom to carry along with my T2i to compensate this problem.  Found one with 14MP - not bad.

And I am saying this just after a month of owning it. It is expensive but I guess the price range is appropriate for DSLRs across the range.
