{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Overall Good Camera", "Author": "L. Huynh \"alexbmwz8\"", "ReviewID": "R2GUI49PK73I14", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a few months and it works well in the aspects of taking pictures and recording video. The pictures are clear and the videos have nice quality.The user-interface is very friendly and easy to use. The different modes are great and it really comes down to shooting with the right mode and settings to get the best out of your pictures. A great feature is \"D- Lighting\" which will brighten any picture if the photo was too dark. Nikon's cameras are easy to use and are reliable.There are some negatives to this camera as well. Something that has come to be a little bit of a problem is the fact that this camera uses two double-A batteries instead of rechargeable ion batteries, which is bad because the batteries exhaust quickly after continuous use,like viewing your photos, and eventually die. Also, the buttons on the camera become problematic. They lose their firmness and become weak and squeaky after a few months use. Also, the arm-strap that comes w/ the camera,(which is to be attached to the side) is completely and utterly useless. It offers no security because there is no tightening/loosening function, and unless your arms are as thick as a dictionary, the camera will fly right off your hand.", "Date": "November 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "nikon camera", "Author": "Jessica E.

McDonald", "ReviewID": "R2MAEF7GUDXI6D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera has several really annoying quirks.  First of all, it takes it forever to focus when you first turn it on.  On a stationary subject, expect to make 3-4 attempts for it to focus.  This is about 5-10 seconds.  Hard to capture special moments when it takes 10 seconds to take a picture.  Also, if you attempt to focus it on any subject, even one you JUST took a picture of, expect another 2-3 focus attempts and 5+ seconds between pictures.  The face recognition is great, as is the anti-shake and the pictures look great, but what a hassle.  AA batteries are a bonus, as you can just switch them out.  The camera is a little bulky for sliding it in your pocket, but not impossible.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "JP \"JP\"", "ReviewID": "R3CUOM3T2BAKKP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We just openened the camera today and we were impressed.  It is sleek, has a big lcd viewer and takes sharp pictures.  If you are not interested in options and just want to snap some shots, this is very user friendly.  However, if you like B/W photos and adjusting lighting and scenes, etc, this camera will impress as well.  It comes with 2 AA but I just use my rechargeable AA's we had in our old Canon camera, always a great investment. Would definitely recommend.", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "almost had to read the instructions", "Author": "jahornby", "ReviewID": "R25ICUHTKDS8G7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i have had it for about an hour now and have done everything i did with my old camera, getting the flash to work was tough and i almost had to read the instructions lol.  it is about the size of a pack of cigarettes, so it fits into a shirt pocket easy,  and all the button seem to be in the right places for quick use.  i think i would prefer to be able to download pics via usb, but i can handle the sd card, especially since i bought the camera for long hiking trips and i wont have a pc with me anyway.  i dont think it will stand up to much abuse, but with a little bit of care i think it will be a fine point and shoot for all around use.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "AS GOOD AS IT GETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Gary Friedland \"THE CLASS MAVEN\"", "ReviewID": "R34APRFB2Q01KA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GREAT CAMERA FOR THE CASUAL USER AND EXCEPTIONAL PURCHASE, CANNOT GO WRONG WITH NIKON!!!ALWAYS STICK WITH THE BEST, NIKON WILL DO THE REST!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unimpressed", "Author": "Chris Pappas \"Chris Pappas\"", "ReviewID": "R2Z3E4AEAGWELG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about 6 months now, and I really do not like it. First, there is no viewfinder, only a digital display. This is a problem because in bright sunlight, the display is not bright enough to see what you are taking a picture of. When I first used the camera, all of the photos where on the dark side. To overcome this problem you have to adjust the exposure settings from the default. The menus to do this are not easy to navigate. Finally, I have had a lot of problems downloading photos from the camera to my computer. My computer says the disk is blank, although I can view the photos on the camera display.On the good side, the camera small enough to easily fit in you pocket and is inexpensive . I guess you get what you pay for.", "Date": "March 25, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "7.1 megapixel\n3x Zoom Nikkor\nAnti-shake\n2.8\" LCD\nAA batteries, ISO 1600", "Name": "Nikon Coolpix L16 Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Idg4jDffL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001HKHKNW"}}
