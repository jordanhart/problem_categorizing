Original battery from Canon (EOS-M)which is rated at 800mAh lasts 2 times longer than this battery.  If you need to shoot video, think twice before buying this.

I charged them both up and they both came to full charge - I used the charger that came with my camera. However when I put the first of the two batteries I received into the camera I noticed it was a rather tight fit. I could not use the ejector to pop the battery out, but rather had to use a small screw driver and a small pair of pliers to pull it out. It seemed to be slightly bigger than the original battery. I tried the second battery and it fit just fine. So I decided to sand the sides and back of the first battery down a bit and then it fit. My brother-in-law who is quite a camera buff told me that sometimes the batteries can expand if left on a charger too long. Perhaps I should have (and I would recommend) try installing the batteries before charging to make sure it came that way from the factory - and not something I may have done. If it would be true that I caused the battery to expand then I'd certainly give this a 5-star rating, but since I charged both batteries the same way and one worked and one didn't I guess I'll never know. Other than that, they work great!", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good batteries", "Author": "Chuck", "ReviewID": "R10R11LVLPDHT2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "They don't hold a charge as long my actual Canon battery, but as a set of backup batteries, they work well.", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice packaging...", "Author": "SKY", "ReviewID": "RQO0HZDGYC38U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far so good...
