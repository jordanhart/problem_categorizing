{"Reviews": [{"Title": "What do you expect for the money???", "Author": "Christopher Beach", "ReviewID": "R14UIDMJIKJF4Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered the camera for my girlfriend.  It was basically purchased for her social outdoor activities.  It was never intended for any \"real\" photography.  We weren't expecting much out of any camera in this price range, and weren't too surprised.  The delay from the time you pull the trigger to the time that the camera actually captures the image is staggering.  You really have to anticipate what you are shooting.  Expect to hold a pose for quite awhile when usung this camera.  The navigation for the features is less than intuitive.  It takes awhile to get use to the menues and submenues. This is coming from a person who has had four previous Olympus cameras. The image quality is decent if you have good lighting.  Anything less, expect blur.  That being said, for the money, it is a good camera.  The 5x of opitcal zoom is useful. Also, the camera came with a micro sd adapter, which in itself has value if you are not ready to commit to the XD cards.  The batteries are a nice change to the Olympus cameras that I am use to.  It's nice to have AA's.  This allows flexibilty for powering. It also keeps it mobile for travel.  No chargers to lug around if you don't want to.  My previous cameras required Olympus's propietary batteries, which meant not only do you need to travel with that added equipment, but you also had at least an hour of downtime to recharge if you didn't want to spent the extra money on a spare pack. The AA's are readly available with a rechargable option if desired.  On alkaline batteries, the life was good for about 50 images with alot of flashing and zoom adjustments.  Obviously lithium batteries offer even more performance.", "Date": "November 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wish I invested a little more for better camera", "Author": "R. Bare", "ReviewID": "R1FKDWQAQTLZ3O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera for my 12 year old for Christmas b/c she was always using mine.  I thought that the Olympus would be a great choice since I loved my Olympus 35mm.  With the price being reasonable, I didn't hesitate.  I wish I did.  My daughter liked the color of the camera, and that was about it.  The pictures are blurry, dark, and take many seconds to get to memory.  It is almost like the camera freezes for about 5-8 seconds before you can take another picture.  At first we just used the xd memory card that came with it (holds only about 3 pictures), just to test it out.  Then we thought that we would ofcourse go ahead and get the 2mg memory card (this is the highest they offer), to see if that made a difference.  It did not.  Needless to say, we are sending it back to Amazon.  Hopefully for a full refund.  I do not know how all that works since I have never returned anything.  If a full refund is granted, I will be looking at investing a little more for the Canon Powershot SD1200 -- and hopefully, have more success.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Great Price", "Author": "Beautiful Mind 504", "ReviewID": "R2PL589BH65CCX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to use on my upcoming vacation.

I hate the delay time when trying to capture the moment. The moment is missed while your still holding down the shutter button (not to mention when holding down the shutter button the camera is in focus mode, at that time when you are looking at your LCD monitor it darkens to the point that you cannot cleary view your image).  I was shocked that my pictures were almost all blurry even though I was completely still at the time of the shot.Also the XD card inserts into the same area of the batteries, a real pain when you want easy access.  Lastly I find the buttons to be very hard to use and inconvient because they are so small (on/off, shooting/switching, playback, etc.) On a postive note. I must say that color of the camera is beautiful. The camera is sleek and attractive, but beauty is NOT a reason for selecting a camera! PERFORMANCE is more important.

Big difference.  As reported in other earlier reviews, the pictures from the FE46 are mostly blurry and dark.  It takes so long to automatically focus, that my intended shot of my young grandchildren is often lost.  I have lots of photos of just after the main event, e.g. the blowing out of the candles on a birthday cake.  There was no manual, only a DVD which is inconvenient for me.  The settings are non-intuitive. I emailed Olympus Customer Service to ask for help and was told to put it on 'Animal' setting for photographing children.  It didn't help.  I wish I\"d returned it but I kept thinking it was me - that I didn't have it set right.  No amount of settings changes have helped the picture quality.

I recieved it as a gift when i was expecting my 2nd child so that i could capture all the beautiful firsts and precious moments that come along with 2 children.Major dissapointment! This camera takes about 5 seconds to actually take the picture after you push the button. so you never get the shot you intended or aim for. The settings for diffrent lighting situations are useless, they just make the pictures blurry and dark, except the setting for fireworks, that one takes awsome pics! For the most part you use 1 main setting for all situations.As far as battery life goes, i have no idea why with normal use that the camera drains them in roughly 45 min. you cant take this camera to a zoo or amusement park or the beach without at least 3 sets of extra batteries PER DAY! With that being redicoulous, you end up with no pictures of the event you intend to capture. Buy recargable right? Did that, and the camera drains them in 1/2 an hour even when its turned off.  I have little to no good pictures of my 2nd daughters first 9 months because of owning this camera and not having the money to spend on another, untill now!Needless to say I would strongly recommend againts anyone buying this camera and losing out like i have. So i \"lost\" the camera it and am glad, its a great excuse to buy a real one.I am gonna post the pics if possable of the firework setting because they are truely awsome, and i do understand that not everyone would want a camera for children so if you want a camera for fireworks only id say this is the one if you can deal with the batteries and capture delay.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "not as good as other models", "Author": "Scott G.

Also i would like too add, when using reviews too make your mind up on a product, dont forget there are thousands of products made everyday of the same product, lemons come with everything we buy, you just have too be one of the people lucky enough not too get one, so dont be so closed minded that the product you buy couldnt possibly have been broken from shipping or handling or whatever, which is what made your experience a bad one instead of a good one....and of course there is always operator error as well.

There are categories to take photos of food, in dark settings, action settings, etc. It has a nice 5x zoom. I have other Olympus cameras and I am very happy with the quality. I take a lot of photos and never had a problem.", "Date": "February 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "I guess its okay for the price", "Author": "lazy yet not", "ReviewID": "R3RVX7N6G63R7Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I didnt expect much considering the price of the camera but I at least expected a rechargeable battery. All the money you save on this camera, you end up spending anyway (on disposable batteries). By the way it also does not take video. I didnt think I would get a top of the line camera but I expected better than this.", "Date": "January 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera for kids", "Author": "L.

He's always using my phone to take pictures to entertain himself while at his brothers' soccer games.  Now, he has his own camera to use.  It's perfect for an 8 year old or even an older chld/teen.  It's easy to use & produces great photos.  We haven't had any pictures printed, but the photos look great on the computer.  I think it's a great value!", "Date": "January 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "rockadoodle \"Rockadoodle fan\"", "ReviewID": "R1GBW1A48NR13A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Good seller, bad camera.

This one, however, is so difficult to operate and understand that I have decided to return it immediately.  Even though I am pretty \"computer-literate\", the instructions were way beyond me - I don't recommend it to anyone who needs a simple camera which can easily be used and then have the pictures transferred to computer.  I was so frustrated trying to understand all the complicated instructions, that it wasn't going to be any fun to use!", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Deal in Good Price!!!!!!", "Author": "Peeyush Tak", "ReviewID": "R1ITIAMFG6L9LG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this camera.This i bought for my wife she really like it.Thats all i want to say for this camera....Good Deal in Good price.", "Date": "December 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Cheap", "Author": "Theresa L.

So, hopefully, I can go purchase a memory card and then see how the camera operates.  I think it is really poor planning and rude that you can't even use the camera out of the box.
