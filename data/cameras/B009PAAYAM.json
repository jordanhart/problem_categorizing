I wanted to compliment how fast it came, though.  I just ordered it about 2 days ago and it's here already!  I looked at all the items and everything looks good, except my only complaint would be that the camera case is much too small for a bundle order.  It only fits the camera and nothing else.  But, with the price so reasonable for the items, I will go purchase a larger case.  I will re-review the product once I get it home, charge it up, and take some pictures with it.  I'm extremely excited to do so.  Again, I would suggest including a larger camera case as this one is useless for me because it will not fit the extra lenses and items.  It is a nice case (excellent quality) if you have just a small camera to put in it, so I'll save it for one of my older cameras. Thanks for the VERY fast shipping!  I would definitely recommend this seller.  I will review the actual camera in a few days.Second review of actual camera:I love the camera.  I'm a novice. It's easy to use and takes sharp, clear pictures.  You can just point and shoot if you want to or learn the other manual features.  Unfortunately, I have not had time to learn much about the other camera features, but will as time permits.  It's a great camera for someone like me... something easy to use that takes great pictures.  I did a lot of research prior to purchasing this camera and am glad I did.  The recommendations were correct.  I'm looking forward to spending more time using the additional lenses, as well.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "camera is great ,extras are no good", "Author": "Mark Ladago", "ReviewID": "R2XAAGDCW0CSM1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "would not ever buy the ultimate package as the 2 lenses that come with it are not compatible with the fz-200 . waste of money. i had to order a DMW-LA7 LENS ADAPTER AND A 2X converter at an extra 200.00 to get whay i wanted. the camera is great but you can have the extra stuff that doesnt work with this camera", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "G.

I should have just bought the camera by itself and hand picked the accessories I needed. Those that came in the kit are bottom rung accessories. I have a video on YT about accessories worth getting.
