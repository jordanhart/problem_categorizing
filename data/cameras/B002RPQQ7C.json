{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great compact setup, easy to use.", "Author": "P. Higgins", "ReviewID": "R2USZ1U3H5I4SE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a small surveillance system at home and after a few hours research sellected this setup.The CCD camera is a plus and has a very nice picture in daylight. Night time views are OK if the subject is within fifteen to twenty feet to be picked up by the infrared lighting. Farther away subjects can be seen but with less detail. Note that the camera does switch to black and white mode at night, doesn't seem to be a problem though.The mini DVR is easy to setup and use. The manual is a little difficult to understand at points, but I was able to get enough out of it to finish the install.The camera and DVR both come with BNC to RCA connector adapters, I was very relieved to find them in the box.A small TV can be used with this setup to complete the system.", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$919.95", "Features": "Easy setup and installation DVR Recorder System\nMini DVR Recorder built-in motion detection\nAll videos with audio; Time stamp on pictures\nIncludes color night vision audio camera, camera power supply and 50ft AV security camera cable\nRecording resolution and fast recording: 640x480@30fps (Adjust frame at 5, 15 or 30 f/s)", "Name": "VideoSecu Mini DVR Motion Detector Digital Video Recorder Audio Video CCTV Security Camera Home Surveillance System, Including Day Night Built-in 1/3\" SONY CCD Audio Security Camera, Power Supply and Camera Extension Cable W32", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Wn8vColpL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002RPQQ7C"}}
