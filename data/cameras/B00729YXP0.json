Olsen", "ReviewID": "RQ0E18ABK29LA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm giving this camera four stars, but one star is for the low price.  First of all, the people who give it low marks for picture quality need to either read the manual or understand a few things about photography.  The picture quality is actually excellent if you know what you are doing.  The wide angle lens allows you to take very good pictures in rather low light WITHOUT a flash.  With a 25mm equivalent lens, you can actually get by with a shutter speed of 15th of a second and have your picture come out.  That means if you set the ISO to 400, you can shoot in some pretty low light.  Conversely, the 21x zoom is the equivalent to more than 500mm in 35mm.  If you are zoomed in that much, you either need to be on a tripod or have a shutter speed of 1000th of a second or less.All in all, if you know what you are doing with this camera, the picture quality is superb.Battery?  There are many of us who prefer cameras that run on AA batteries for the versatility.  That's all I'm going to say about that.And finally, the one big drawback.  There is no way to control the aperture and shutter speed.  I've found a few workarounds for this, but if I want to be able to shoot a shot at 1/1000th of a second or five seconds, regardless of exposure, I'd like that option.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "You'll like this camera if this is the sort of camera you are looking for", "Author": "UnseenWorld", "ReviewID": "RST4NK2OCJ2J7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About me: I'm a pro photographer and I wanted a knocking around camera that met several requirements. First, I wanted a camera that was relatively small. Second, I wanted one that's relatively lightweight. Third, I wanted one that was very \"point and shoot.\" Fourth, I wanted quite a bit of zoom range, not 5x or even 10x, but much more. Fifth, I wanted a camera capable of taking very good photos. Finally, I wanted one that was cheap.My work camera is a Nikon D600. This is technically more of a high-end \"prosumer\" camera than a true pro camera. That said, it gets the job done for me and the extra money spent on a true pro camera wouldn't provide any benefit to a guy who shoots pretty girls mostly indoors. If I shot sports or wanted a camera to take with me to the summit of Mt. Everest, I might spend two or three times as much, but the D600 has all the image quality of its much more expensive siblings and weighs less, which has become important to me. Even with the D600, I can have sore shoulders after 6 or 8 hours of continual shooting.While my D600 could be put into Program or Auto mode and be used as a point-and-shoot and still take great photos, and while I had a wide-range (28-300mm) zoom, it didn't meet the other three requirements of being small, light in weight, and inexpensive.My need was for a camera I could take with me all day without its weight wearing me out, without keeping me distracted as I manage all of its controls, and for a camera that wouldn't have me in tears if I dropped it or it was stolen. Let's face it: walking around with a D600 and a big lens is an invitation to have it taken at gunpoint!I had been keeping my eyes open for just the right camera at a great price when I got an offer from one of the major discounters (not Amazon, sorry to say) offering the Nikon L310, factory refurbished, for just $99.99. I checked out the specs and the reviews and decided that this looked like a good bet. At just about $100, it would still be worth it even if was a bit disappointing.I've had it for a little while now and I'm pretty pleased with it. Were I not a pro, I'd probably be totally happy with it, but I'll try to look at it from the point of view of the casual photographer who mainly takes personal, family, and vacation photos. Looked at that way, it's a great buy even at twice $99.99.Getting back to my requirements and how it satisfies them...Size: The L310 is quite small. Photos of it without something to give one a sense of scale tend to be a little misleading, since it looks kind of like a DSLR, but in truth it's about 60%-75% of a Nikon or Canon DSLR in physical dimensions.Weight: The L310 weighs about a third what my D600 with its 28-300mm lens mounted weighs, much of that weight coming from the four AA batteries that power it. It's not so light that a strong breeze could blow it off a picnic table, though hurrican force winds might.Ease of Use: For a pro, it's frustratingly easy. There is no (M)anual mode whatsoever. No (S)hutter Priority or (A)perture Priority modes, either. Every photo you take with it is either totally or mostly totally automatic. You can control ISO but most of your control actually comes down to choosing what program mode to use. And it has a lot of different program modes. Almost too many, I'd say. If anything, they overdid the program modes bit. Mostly, you'll be safe to just leave it in AUTO or EASY AUTO mode.Zoom range: The L310 has a 21x optical zoom. This is fairly high. Other cameras have 24x or more, but 21x is a lot given that many cameras brag of having something like a 5x zoom. Of course, the problem as your zoom factor gets stronger is that the more zoom you use, the more camera wobble can screw up your shots making them soft or even blurred.Quality of photos: It's a Nikon. The optics are good, the camera is well-designed, and so the photos are certainly plenty good for a camera in this range. This camera is about as thoroughly automatic as a camera can be. It's designed by some of the best camera and optics engineers in the world. How could the photos not be good?!!!Price: I've already talked about the price. Like I said, I got a refurbished (=newish) one for near $100. Amazon and others are selling them new at $200 or so and that's still a very good price.Now, I didn't get into resolution as a requirement, and let me tell you why. The L310 is 14.1 megapixel camera, which is more than you need if you are even thinking of a camera in this general range. To tell you the truth, you can get a good 8x10 photo from a 3 megapixel camera. The current trend toward selling 20+ megapixels is insane even in the pro category. Unless one is shooting a mural, 14 megapixels is much more than adequate. In fact, since the camera gives you the option of shooting smaller photos, I'd set the camera to take photos no larger than 2048z1536 (3 megapixels). For family or vacation photos, this is more than large enough. If you take a lot of 14.1 megapixel photos, it will chew up a lot of space on your hard drive, and before you know it you'll be buying external drives just to house all of your needlessly large photos. Also, the larger the photos you take, the sooner they'll fill up your memory card.Anyway, in conclusion, for the everyday non-pro user who wants a camera that meets the primary requirements I listed in the beginning, you won't do a whole lot better for $200.One final tip: If you want an in-depth look at the camera, you can view the user's guide here:[...]", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it!", "Author": "McKenzie, NH", "ReviewID": "R1YOML1LORR7SB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this Camera from my hubby for Christmas.

For the longest time I use using fully manual 35MM cameras. But as the digital age took over my 35mm camera went the way of the dinosaur.  Since the majority of my photos now are of grandchildren and our dog....a fully automatic camera made sense.....onto my review.I needed to replace my old Panasonic DMC-F7Z that was showing it's age. I had many too choose from on Black Friday, but the price on this unit and the Nikon name made it a simple choice. We've taken many photos and a video, while it's strength is not the video, it shines in the photo area. I will admit, when we first got it I had a few issues with it, but after doing some reading of the manual (on disc) I figured out what I was doing wrong. The talk you hear about focusing issues is somewhat true, in low light conditions with the zoom it has trouble focusing, but in average to good lighting no issues. For the price, a steal of a deal.  I would buy this camera again.Side by side with the Panasonic, this unit is about the same size, I like a camera with some substance, no little boxes for me, it weighs a little more than the Panasonic, again I like that.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Regret my purchase.", "Author": "Just wish it would work", "ReviewID": "R3TVHHZ6YOBX0L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Wow, wish I had never wasted my time on this camera. I was so excited to get it and ended up really disappointed. There is *A LOT* of noise in the pictures. Forget using it inside. All my outdoor pictures had more noise and artifacts than my old Canon from 10 years ago. My camera phone has turned into my \"go to\" camera since this one takes such lousy shots.The most annoying thing is, I have only used this camera a few times and it no longer works. I have had it for a total of 4 months and when I click the shutter button sometimes it works, sometimes the camera shuts down (the batteries are brand new). It is a completely random phenomenon. Also, there are already some pixels out on the display. I have taken excellent care of this camera and it is already unusable.I've been trying for the past 3 hours to send this camera back for repair. Nikon makes it as difficult as possible, my guess is that they hope people will get frustrated and give up. I called in, spoke to rep for about 15 minutes, thought it was scheduled. Nope. I was sent a link to schedule. Link didn't work on three different browsers. Finally got through by finagling my settings and this model number isn't even listed in their returns system, which means scheduling is not possible.I will NEVER purchase Nikon again!", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "OMG GREAT BUY LOVE ITTTTTTTT", "Author": "chemistry4life", "ReviewID": "R3QQUTBJMPL8JR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "when i got the package in the mail the first thing i saw was the amazon smile on the box and i was hoping that once i opened it i would be smiling as well. to make a long story short i was very impressed when i opened the box and saw the camrea. the fluid amazing quality pictures that it takes is unbeatable for the price. its no SLR, obviously, but for this price you cant go wrong. it says i bought but the box came in brand new unopened, it seems like amazon has a restriction on selling it new so dont let that turn you off becasue mine came in new.

A web search found several users that have lens opening issues - but to be fair any camera with a telescoping lens is at risk, but the power button on this camera makes it pretty easy.There is way more image noise in the image than I expected. The lower the light, the more the noise. Image sharpness and overall quality are so so. The long zoom is not very good for sharpness and forget the digital zoom for anything other than curiosity.In all honesty this camera produces SLIGHTLY better images than a cellphone. The zoom makes this a better camera than a cellphone, but not by much.For the money it's ok - it's best for 4x6 prints, a cheap trip camera and web sharing.
