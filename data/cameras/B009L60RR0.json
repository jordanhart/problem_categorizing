I think this camera is so useful especially when you travel abroad because it has Wi-Fi available and also when you travel alone because it has Multiview Compact Display which can show very vivid screen images and video movies, so you can take so many pictures and videos of yourself without asking anyone to take your pictures! Moreover this kit's price is rather reasonable, I think. So I love this camera!", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$219.00", "Features": "16.31MP 1/2.33\" BSI CMOS Sensor with 25-125mm f/2.5-6.3 Lens\n3.31\" AMOLED Flip-Out Touchscreen\nFull HD 1920 x 1080 30p Video\nGesture Shot for Self-Portraiture and Advanced In-Camera Photo Editing\nIntegrated Wireless Capabilities and Social Media Sharing and Auto Backup", "Name": "Samsung MV900F Multiview Smart w/ Wi-Fi Digital Camera in White + 16GB Deluxe Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51cHIQFGqGL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009L60RR0"}}
