{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty good for what it is", "Author": "The Draconic Nabokovian", "ReviewID": "R86R282PRQDFP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just spent the day trying out this camera as the backup to my Canon SX40 and as a potential toss in the pocket and go/social outing camera.  I've owned several Sony Cybershots before and in general, they tend to be a great outdoor picture camera and very poor indoors and in low lighting.  After reviewing the day's photos, I've come to the following conclusions:1. First, let's state the obvious.  There's no comparing this quality-wise to the Canon SX40 and nor should there be.  This is a budget compact point and shoot, whereas the SX40 is a bridge camera, frankly the best camera I've ever owned.  That said, the quality is pretty good for its price range from first impressions (I took 43 photos in a variety of conditions, angles and zoom levels.  30 of the 43 I felt good enough quality to upload to my Japan photoblog on Facebook - a pretty good ratio, considering several of the pictures were duplicate efforts at the same shot).2. In particular, this camera's indoor and low-light shooting ability is vastly improved over, oh, pretty much every Cybershot I've ever owned in the past.  Canon will still, in general, outperform Sony in those two categories, but in my mind, this one's a major leap forward for the Sony Cybershot line.3. It's perfect for just throwing in my pocket and traipsing around.  No need to carry the camera bag like with the SX40.  So for that reason and the increased indoor/low-light ability, I'm thinking it will work just fine for going out with friends and all that sort of thing.4. The 10x zoom isn't going to be easy to find in the sub-$200 range, and that's quite honestly probably the biggest reason I got this as my backup camera.  I just wanted a cheap camera that took decent pictures and had at least an 8x zoom.  It fits the bill terrifically there.5. The image stabilization on this camera is *very* good for the price range, in my opinion.  I tend to have shaky hands and only two or three pictures came out with significant blur.Since I've listed the pros, let's go to the cons:1. The single biggest con - THIS IS A VERY SLOW PROCESSING TIME CAMERA.  So if you're the sort who likes to get lots of shots off at once, avoid this camera.  I found it a touch annoying, but since I tend to like to take time to set up my shots anyway, it didn't irritate me quite as much as it might some people.2. For people with large hands like mine, the buttons/etc. can feel somewhat crowded and it may take pressing a second or third time when pushing the on/off button to get it to turn off.3. If you're used to something like the SX40's 35x zoom, the 10x zoom will be something of an adjustment period and a culture shock.  So to be quite honest, if zoom power is a big deal to you, as it is for me, rather than get this camera, I would save up and get the Canon SX40.Overall Verdict:If you're on a budget and either can't afford or don't want to spend $200+ on a camera, or if you're looking for a low-end point and shoot compact you can just stick in your pocket and not have to haul around your primary camera, this is a good camera to get.  It offers a nice all-around game of image quality, stabilization feature, and a decent for the money zoom in a compact, portable package.  Be sure that you can live with the slow processing time, though.  As part of that, do keep in mind that in this range no camera is going to be perfect.  Every one you find for this price ballpark is going to have some drawback to deal with.", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fine camera for the average picture-taker like me...", "Author": "Harris M. \"NYC-NY\"", "ReviewID": "R6K22M6TFR59H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just came back from a six week trip to Eastern Europe.  I had with me a Sony SteadyShot DSC-T100.  Four weeks ago, in Krakow, Poland, the SteadyShot suddenly died after three years of fairly rugged use.  I went to an electronics store in Krakow and, not having ready access to the Internet, decided to take a chance on the W690, which looked similar to the now-deceased SteadyShot in design and functionality (if you've ever bought an electronic gadget in Europe you know that you simply have to swallow hard and do it since the 23% VAT adds, well, 23% to the price, which even when you have it refunded at the airport, is eaten up by the processing fee).But I digress. I fell in love with this camera.  I am a basic point-and-shoot picture taker.  I am sitting with both cameras in front of me as I write this review.  The 690 is half the weight of the T100, which wasn't all that heavy to begin with, and half as slim as the T100, which wasn't exactly a \"pocket pig.\"  The zoom was extraordinary and the functionality, including basic video, panorama-picture and just plain easy handling was great for a traveler who wants to take a nice shot now and then.  The shot-framing was straightforward.  The low-light quality of the pics was quite fine.  I tried the panorama-shot feature for the first time standing on Castle Hill in Vilnius, Lithuania and was very pleasantly surprised at the ease of the feature and the spectacular shot of the Baroque old town that I now have.  The camera indulged my occasional attempts to get \"artsy\" with different focus, lighting and framing.I uploaded 500 or so shots to the PC last night and the quality of the pictures is exactly what I had hoped for. If you are a point-and-shooter like me who just wants to take good pictures this camera will be an excellent choice.Now I only have to pick out the 25 shots that my friends and family will be willing to look at.", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed and returned", "Author": "Steeler Fan", "ReviewID": "R1E2RPD2EQBDS8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I dropped my old Sony camera and it wouldn't power up.  After owning two Sony digital cameras and two Sony camcorders over the years I hoped the DSC W690 would be just as likeable as a replacement. It was not.  To play back a photo to view it immediately would show \"Accessing\" on the screen first for several seconds.  This is annoying and my prior cameras did not do this. Using in autofocus mode for anything moving was also a problem.  By the time the shutter snapped, the subject was gone or out of focus.  We are talking a person processing by at a wedding, not a race car flying by.  I returned the camera for a refund and got a Panasonic Lumix SZ7 that we are very happy with.  Sorry, Sony.  I tried to be faithful.", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great Camera For The Price", "Author": "B. Salisbury", "ReviewID": "R19A19ZBUZQGNS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my Parents to replace an aging camera. Bought it at a great price and was really happy with the output of both the pictures and video on this camera. Not as good as my higher priced Sony, but very nice all the same. I am use to the Sony menus on my camera and this one was not much different, except that it has less options, therefor a simpler menu. I set it in Intelligent mode and showed them how to zoom, how to switch back and forth from video mode, press the shutter button, and how to view the files and they were good to go...", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value for price", "Author": "xxeno", "ReviewID": "R2X3W0MY437H3F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera and for the price you definitely can't go wrong. Images taken on the one I bought were great quality and pretty sharp. Zoom on the optical 10x was decent but not the best, but the auto-focus compensates enough. The soft skin mode to me just seems to blur the images a little by using a soften effect like what you get on some editing software.Image stabilization is decent as expected from Sony and video is decent at 30 fps on 720p, but doesn't adjust focus as fast as I would have liked for some scenes. I suggest using a class 10 card in it for smooth video and expect it to fill up fast if you're using it at maximum settings/resolution. The flash is ok, though I'd prefer to have good lighting anyway to get natural shot and have a real sense of the environment although depending on your angle, it will seem to get a dark shot if the light source is behind the object or person you're shooting, but it does compensate a little.If you're a point a click person I suggest you leave settings on auto and just go with it. The camera does a great job of scene recognition and adjusts to suit and as we all know, digital zoom is a waste of time, so don't think you'll get a high quality pic at a long distance as their cameras tend to pixelate images when using digital zoom  . Anything within 30 feet is sharp, after that you start having to really work for that quality image. Close-ups are good and most are clean. Some colours look forced, on some plants very saturated on some deep colours (bright coloured ones were fine), and some other stuff I mentioned above are better on other cameras within the price range although not thrown together like on this model. Don't expect great low light pics but some are passable depending on the light available.So it is worth a buy? In my opinion yes, as long as you don't expect too much for a budget price and aren't going to be snapping underwater pics and video (don't get it wet, and if you do, switch off, remove batteries and memory card and dry immediately and thoroughly), It's a bit smooth to touch and does feel sometimes like it'll fall out your hand, but is pretty comfortable otherwise and works well. So as a budget camera, you could do worse!", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just keeps getting better", "Author": "Vivi", "ReviewID": "R10DICYPK9MHVB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is at least the third Sony Cybershot that I have personally owned and it's the best yet.  My previous generation was great but I lost it prior to an important trip and figured if I had to buy another that I should go ahead and upgrade.  I am so delighted that I did....almost makes me glad that I lost the old camera.  The increased zoom is astounding for such a little camera if your object on the other end is still.  Night shots without the flash are amazing.  New panorami feature is fun.  Not sure how many applications to use it for.  Only criticism is that the switch between photos, video and panoramic slides way too easily and you wind up in the wrong mode often.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "10X Zoom is great!", "Author": "Joy C.

This is probably the 4th if not 5th Sony Cyber-shot I have owned. I replace them every 12-18 months because the technology improves year over year. Photography has been a hobby of mine for over 20 years back to when film was used in cameras.I really endorse Sony Cyber-shot because of the ergonomics of the camera. I one time switched to Nikon and did not like how had to adjust the different modes through a menu and not a hard button on the camera you can slide up and down to change. You can easily change between photo, panoramic and movie modes on the Cyber-shot. The Nikon didn't take as good quality of the photos as the Sony. This camera takes beautiful photos. I have enlarged the prints to 11x14 and framed them in 16x20 frames in my office. Customers come in and marvel at the beauty of the photo and ask where I took the picture and what camera was used. I tell them it was just a simple point and shoot digital camera and they cannot believe it. The zoom on this camera is a 10x optical zoom. Most cameras are just 5x or 8x, but this one is 10x. I don't zoom often but it is a good zoom.The size of the camera is perfect for every occasion. I take this camera on all of my vacations and it documents my memories. It easily fits in my pocket during travel or I will use the strap to put around my wrist.Definitely recommend and will definitely be a repeat customer to Sony Cyber-shot for the future.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Ronald V.

The only reason I selected this model was the 10x optical zoom feature which I thought was awesome. I liked the slim look of the camera but when I started using it, the happiness didn't last long.First of all, when you switch it to playback mode to view the pics, it takes like 5-8 seconds to load the images from memory.(shows message \"Accessing images\" on a blank screen), especially when you are indoors and wants to verify the pic quality, its annoying to wait 5+ seconds every single time to view the pic.I had the same issue with my last Sony camera which I bought as a gift for my mom.The other 2 canon which I owned previously didn't had this issue. Also the indoor pic quality in dim light is very poor even though I took pics on max resolution with the flash ON.The main reason I am returning it today is because the ON/OFF switch doesn't operate properly.Once you turn it OFF and turn it back ON again, it takes about 4-7 press on the power button before it turns back ON.(what the hell is going on with a brand new Sony camera after 2 days of use), my wife noticed it first, I ignored her since she is not great with electronic stuff, then 2 days later I experienced the same behavior and was mad the thing won't turn back on at all even after 3-4 tries. THAT'S IT, I AM DONE!!! I owned 2 canon and 2 sony before, even the canon I bought in 2005 still performs better than this one,no delay to view the pics in playback mode. No more Sony for me. And also just a heads up, the user manual looks like made out of tissue paper (that too the one you finds in dollar store), Sony is trying to save money in all means they can.Also, this model doesn't have an option to \"delete all\" images from the memory. Either you have to select each one of them and delete or delete by specific dates, so if you have over 500 images and want to delete all of them, you have to delete them date wise, 1 day at a time which is weird. My older canon(2005 model) had a \"delete all\" feature. Sony is so lame...My local BB didn't had this model on store, the return would have been easier that way with full refund.Now I am paying $8.09 for shipping thru UPS.
