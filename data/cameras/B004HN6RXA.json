{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent product. Excellent Company", "Author": "Dave \"Gadget guy\"", "ReviewID": "RKWBOW7FJA0G6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this product to connect some existing sensors from a Brinks system to a new wireless system that I installed myself. I connected three magnetic door sensors, two glass break sensors and one motion sensor that were previously wired to the Brinks panel. When I had a technical question, I sent an email to their technical support and got an answer back in a few minutes even though it was outside of normal business hours. Everything has been working fine for several weeks. I highly recommend the product and the company.", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004HN6RXA"}}
