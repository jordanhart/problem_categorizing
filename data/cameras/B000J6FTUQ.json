I guess with a sensor this small, there is just nothing you can do about it, short of using a noise plug-in with photoshop. At ISO 100 and 200 this is not a problem- jump to 400 and above and it becomes an issue.Now the good news- because of the image stabilization, you can choose a lower speed, and minimize the noise as much as possible.The lens is at least the equal of the one on my Contax TVSIII, which was the sharpest I have ever seen on a pocketable camera.The internal flash is adequate for most conditions, but if you are takin advantage of the wide format, and trying to get a large room or group more than a few feet away, you should get the Metz compact digital flash which matches with it well.I took RAW and JPEGs of the same scene and blew 'em up to 13x19 inches. While the raw image was marginally better, the JPEG (with minimal tweaking) was almost as good, and both were quite usable.If you plan on shooting RAW- bes sure to get a largish high speed SD card.I love that you can shoot manually, and getting great portraits is a snap- easy to blur out the background and get an incredible sharp portrait.The preset modes suck.The screen is great.If you have a good photo stitching program, and you take a landscape photo with the camera vertically (say 4 or 5 sequential shots), taking advantage of the wide format, you will be floored. With this combination you can print landscapes 48 inches wide. I did this at the Eagles game on Monday night (Eagles won- thankfully!)- and the print was remarkable.Nobody on the whole planet has the brown leather case. i want one and I want one bad.Get this camera, be prepared to deal with the limitations of any camera using a small sensor, and you will be a happy clam. You will be able to leave your SLR home more often, and have a great camera with you always so you never miss a shot.If you found this review useful, please send me the brown leather case.", "Date": "December 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "A good (not great) camera. Nice but not super-nice. Yet very chic & cool.", "Author": "J. Douglas \"world's smartest idiot\"", "ReviewID": "R3URCIZLPAHACG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First off, let me tell you I have been shooting with a Canon20D with 3 different lenses for the past four years, my basis for review IS biased, opinionated, and thus the Leica is being forced to compete with an SLR worth 2-3x the value of itself. Gyeah!It's sort of a Leica. The camera is metal and has a retro-feel to it. I do like the simplicity of the dials. But it's made in Japan and it wouldn't take a die-hard camera-guru to tell you it's a souped up Panasonic.I feel like I bought a Lexus with a maserati emblem on it. It's really good, but I expected fantastic.NOISIER THAN A SLAYER CONCERT! My goodness this thing has trouble with dark lighting. Uggghhh. I wouldn't shoot this anywhere I didn't need sunglasses. 4 out of 10.THE COLOR IS DECENT. An 8 out of 10.LAGS! Press the shutter, wait, wait, wait, think about what you might have for lunch tommorow, wait, wait, wait... okay. Picture time. If you want to take a photo of any sport faster than chess or catfish noodling, don't get this camera. 2 out of 10OVERALL PHOTO QUALITY.  It does take good photos. It collects a surprising amount of detail. The focusing is ingenious (sp?) for a point and shoot, and the options are nearly unlimited (3 different ways to photograph babies! 2 different skintone options) THere is a brain in there. 9 out of 10!!!!!!!!!! I'd go 8.5, but the focusing is quite brilliant, i.e. depth of field.MANUAL SETTING.  THe programming is nearly unlimited, you need to spend at least half an hour to an hour to read and understand all the different settings available. But, in manual mode, THERE IS NO FOCUSING RING! You merely push the button up or down to tell it to focus in or out (like cheap video cameras). Left and Right button control aperature, and there are film speeds to choose from (100-200asa for me, buddy). But no it's not manual in the sense one would expect from a \"swiss/german\" camera-smithery. 4 out of 10FLASH Wow! 10 out of 10! Why? Because it's manual. When you want the flash, you press the MECHANICAL button and the flash MECHANICALLY pops up and the flash is in use. When you don't want the flash, you press it down MECHANICALLY. It's built in, of course, but it's not \"built-in\". And in baby mode, the flash reduces the flare and glare as to not burn second degree scars into the baby retinas.BUILD/FINISH/STURDINESS  It's metal! Just like those more expensive good cameras. It's satiny, and it has a big bright red logo that let's everybody know you only get the best things you can afford. YOur fancy, and you like to spend money! People will admire you more and treat you with respect. Just like a Gucci purse, or six hundred dollar sequined jeans that were ripped on purpose at the factory and sprayed with acidic bleach by robots. IF your REALLY materialistic and want everyone to think your a rockstar, this is the camera for you. THere is a fifteen thousand dollar gold Mamiya with diamonds on it, but I'd rather get the Hassleblaad h3 for that price. Just kidding, some people do just like really good cameras, like me. I guess it's pretty strong, my girlfriend dropped it at the gunrange today and it was fine. 9 out of 10. It could be sturdier, heavier, more made for Nepal/Tenderloin expeditions.BANG FOR BUCK 5 out of 10. FOr the same price you could probably get a decent Canon Rebel, or a super nice Canon point and shoot. Or for 170$  you could get a nice Sony, Panasonic, or Canon and spend the rest on a nice weekend roadtrip vacation and have something to take pictures for. And if you spent twice as much as this camera  you would have a real sweet digital SLR! But SIX HUNDRED BUCKS? FOR A POINT AND SHOOT? 5 out of 10. It is ten megapixels though.LCD SCREEN14 out 10. That's right 14 out of 10. The screen is so ridiculously nice and big, I could watch Lawrence of Arabia on it. I've seen airplane seats with smaller LCD screens. The screen is so frickin' nice, I'm terrified I bought a two hundred dollar camera with a four hundred dollar LCD screen attached to it. I wish the company had put the money and technology towards the sensor, the lens, and the overall sturdiness. 14 out of 10.LENS.  Sweet lens. I'm not sure if it's german, swiss, or Japanese. But it's from one of the three and it is nice glass. Most point and shoots have lenses the size of Charles Manson's pupils, but it's impressive. I also LIKE the fact it doesn't fully retract into the camera. Most people probably don't like this feature, because it's bulkier and harder to store. But for the purpose of PHOTOGRAPHY, (the purpose of having a camera, duh), it makes for a better camera, that it doesn't retract fully back into the camera (which brings more afghan dust and somali sand in the camera). Maybe it even has SLR style mirrors in there? I don't know, I'm not an expert, I'm just a guy who OWNS and USES this camera. 9 out 10. I'd give it 10, but there is no bloody focusing ring.OVERALL6 out 10.  It's a nice camera, but not super nice. I do like the big lens, I do like the retro feel and the nice old school dials, it keeps it simple. The metal finish is great. It has a great LCD screen. It says Leica, it's made of Metal, but it's Panasonic as that radio/tapeplayer I had back in 87 that was aqua green and shaped like a anti-hystamine gel-tab. For a hundred or two, or a thousand more, you could have a really nice camera. I was expecting Leica. Heavy metal with a great lens and mechanicality above computer. (yes, I do know the difference between 35 and digi, but I want what I can't have) Get the Panasonic instead.

There are, however, some occasions where for a variety of reasons I can not bring a 3 pound 8-inch long camera with me. I have tried many different compact point and shoot offerings over the years, and I have owned many different compact point and shoot models over the years. This one is the best by far that I have tried.The noise level is the biggest concern that I have seen people site about this camera. I personally am extremely sensitive to noise, and I have returned other cameras in the past because of it within 3 hours of buying them. I guess we must be looking at two different cameras, because I don't see it as a problem as compared with other compact point and shoot cameras. In fact it is far lower than every other compact point and shoot camera that I have used. The only time I could get this camera to produce a high level of noise was when I was shooting in very low light (indoors with almost all the lights off) and using no flash. Is that how you plan on using this camera? Then don't worry about the noise. That's not to say that there is no noise. There is noise. More noise than a DLSR? Yes. Again, we're talking compact point and shoot though. This is not a DSLR camera, so it would be unfair to compare it to one. I have tested the latest high dollar compact point and shoot offerings of Canon, Nikon, and Olympus and they all have at least triple the amount of noise this camera does. The only thing that I can think of that must account for this complaint is that Leica owners are typically more educated and sensitive to this type of stuff than the average compact point and shoot owner. I wonder if maybe traditional Leica owners are looking at the performance of this camera through \"the lens\" of their past Leica experience, rather than through the \"lens\" of all other compact point and shoot cameras. If they did the latter, I would be shocked if they had any complaints about this camera.I will say again, this is the finest compact point and shoot ever made--yet. That may change next week, month, year, etc. But right now it is the best hands down. Better pictures, less noise, more controls, more options, better workmanship than any other compact point and shoot out there that I know of. Period. Again, everyone please just compare this to other compact point and shoot cameras. There are way too many people comparing it to entry level DSLRs because the prices are similar. This is not a DSLR. This is a compact point and shoot camera. It has its place, just like the DSLR has its place. In its place, it is the king. If you must talk DLSR vs. this compact point and shoot camera, I will say that this is the closest you will get to DSLR performance without actually buying a DSLR. If you know of a better compact point and shoot I would love to know about it. In my opinion, this camera is vastly underrated. Luckily, the resale market is great for these so if you get it and don't agree with me you can always resell it fairly easily. I doubt you will, though. I fell in love with this camera 5 minutes into using it. I was even surprised at how it looks in person. The pictures of the camera itself don't even do it justice, let alone the reviews.

I've owned this camera for almost a year now and been extremely happy with the results (other than bum composition on my part!) First and foremost, the lens quality is WAY above any point-and-shoot film or digital camera I've ever used; It produces that certain Leica ambiance in color, black & white, sepia, and even to a certain extent, flash images - \"warm\" but contrasty and sharp at the same time, with very little noise for a digital. The zoom lens itself is a little slow - the norm for mini-cameras - but if you're looking for speed you need a digi-SLR anyway. You get to choose from 3 different aspect ratios including the normal 3:2, but especially nice is the 16:9 wide for when you're feeling particularly creative or need a little bit more image space. With its clean and unfussy design, the intuitive controls and overrides work smooth and comfortably and the menu options are very easy to use; I needed no help from the (excellent) hard copy manual. There is no conventional viewfinder and the view screen can be reflective but its brightness (adjustable) and large size more than make up for that. The D-Lux 3's metal body gives a feel of substance, but can also be a little hard to hold because of its small overall size. Warning: Though conveniently small enough to fit in your pocket, this camera will be too small for people with shaky hands or weak fingers; They will need a point-and-shoot with a built-in grip, such as the Canon 'G' series. Hold the D-Lux 3 tight and/or use a wrist strap. The buttons on the back are tiny tiny tiny but work smoothly. The anti-shake system works reasonably well, but please don't overly depend on it...As in all digital point-and-shoots, longevity and reliability are yet to be determined but I trust the D-Lux will give me many years of enjoyment.", "Date": "May 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camera but don't pay more than $599", "Author": "Gordon Webster", "ReviewID": "R2T880S3C61AM4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is really a wonderful little camera but it baffles me why Amazon insists on jumping into bed with price gougers like Wall Street Photo. The street price of this camera is $599 and the camera is available from reputable dealers like E.P. Levine in Boston, yet Amazon highlights the ridiculous price of over $1200 being asked for by Wall Street Photo. Don't get me wrong here, Wall Street Photo can charge what they like and I have no problem with that at all, but I always thought Amazon was about getting the consumer a better deal, not the merchants. So come on Amazon, you're not going to endear yourself to your customers by putting the price gougers at the top of the list just because they (presumably) paid you to be there.

The automatic modes, including pre-programmed scene modes, shutter and aperture priority were also a must for me.All these features require a bit of a learning curve, but it's well worth it. In the 3 weeks I have had this camera, I have already managed to take a few great shots, some under difficult conditions, and I see a lot of potential.The user manual is very good, and follows the typical Leica style - fairly technical, consistent, and impeccably detailed.I recommend this for demanding photographers who would like to have a compact, affordable point and shoot camera.", "Date": "November 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "This is THE POINT & SHOOT to OWN!!!", "Author": "Francis D. Magalona \"The Man\"", "ReviewID": "RK24EE9MEYYBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this baby in London back in November and it cost me 499 Quid (Pounds) and it really is worth it. Shot in 16:9 or in 35 mm size, or even LCD or PC Monitor size, this is really a joy to shoot images with. The interface is intuitive, as this is my first Leica, and I never owned a Panasonic Lumix either, so on the get go, I was able to use it right away.The pics, at any mp size you choose is very SHARP. The optics of the Vario Elmarit lens is really the \"star\" of this equipment. It is a \"hi-end/ STYLISH\" backup camera for I have 2 DSLRS Canon's 30D & 400D, and sometimes these things are heavy. If I wanna travel light, I use this. But now, I treasure it so much that I don't want to bang it up, so I bought a cheaper backup to this backup. I got the Powershot G7, and even though they are both 10 megapixels, lens wise, the D-LUX 3 is in a class of it's own. No match.The ooooooohs and ahhhhhhhhhs when people see my toy is priceless, plus the bag, brown, vintage, old skool, and Leica, is an added bonus attraction. I know some people who actually wanna buy the cam because of the bag.The screen of this baby is so wide that you get everything in the picture. At 16:9, you get the whole planet in one frame. That's how wide it is.Thin, matte black, old-skool look, compact, and the stunning visual capture, these are all the plus points. The video at 16:9 setting is 30 fps, dvd quality and super sharp, and performs well in low light.The only flaw I see, is the absence of an optical viewfinder. But Leica, is Leica.

I dont like to be dictated to by a computer, well who does eh? Im the boss! I mean how does that camera know how dark i want those shadows eh???? Simply put it dosn't!Having used this camera a little on location in the desert of arizona i am fairly impressed, its great for landscapes using the 16.9 format and the auto bracket mode is very useful as exposure is impossible to gauge with the screen in bright sunlight. The lens range is a very useful 28mm f2.8 - 112mm f4.9 it is very good having the 28mm (35mm conv ).A quick trip to the local Nascar meeting was also a very good execise to put this little camera through its paces and yeah im sure with a little more telephoto I may have got slighty better shots, but then again im not sure about that, and remember this is a 10MP camera so for a magazine page shot could be zoomed slightly and not suffer at all. Im not sugesting you should buy this over a DSLR for sports but it would be a very handy little back up camera for an event like this. I used to Continuous shooting mode for the pit stop action sequences and it worked great!I have found when needed the Program mode works very well in most situations with a few tweaks in the camera, however the preset modes such 'Party' mode are far from good, giving terrible skin tones. The moral of this story, hmm dont trust a computer.I purchased mine with a spare batt and a couple of 2GIG cards so that i can shoot in RAW most of the time if needed.I would normally be the sort of person who would not care about brand names and go for the panasonic but thought hey its not really that much more and i may tire of having to explain to everyone 'it's really a leica you know, with a different badge on , blah blah balh' so i thought dont be a penny pincher just get what you really want and that was a little red dot.So as a little sum up, i would say if you know what you are doing (as with any camera i guess) and can work around its limitations (lens range lack of accessories ie flash guns, filters etc )this little Leica has the potential to be one of the best cameras you can get period! With its abilty to shoot RAW and giving you 10.4 MP and a good set of optics. Great for travel and candids so very much like the essence of a real rangefinder Leica.A very neat little package.

But they didn't...because consumers want big MP numbers.This camera is unique because it is native 16x9. That changes the way you frame and shoot. At least it has for me. This also gives you very good manual control over things. And being able to shoot RAW is a big deal to me. I got hooked on that with my D70. And speaking of that D70, I just sold it because I am happier with the images I'm getting out of my D-Lux 3. Yes, they can be noisier, but I also can fit the Leica in my pocket.

I am a professional photographer and the image quality blew me away. The color is amazing, and the huge display makes a real difference when viewing images.Upon the third time using this camera it stopped working. I emailed Leica and was pushed around from one person to the next, and they finally told me my shutter was broken. I mailed it in to their service center in NJ, not far from me in NY. A few weeks later I got an estimate telling me it would take 3-4 weeks to repair. It has now been two months. I have regularly emailed all three people I have been in correspondence with on a weekly basis, asking them what the status was on the repair. I still have not heard from anyone since I mailed the camera in.I barely used this camera, just a few shots both times I got to use it, and never dropped it or was careless with it. Being a pro, I am very careful with my gear. I'm more than disappointed that after a few months my camera just stopped working.

It carries on the now grand tradition of Leica digital point and shoot cameras with improved optical image stabilizing and enhanced Leica-designed firmware for ultimate image quality. I had the chance to use this camera briefly twice recently, and was extremely impressed with both its easy handling and superior image quality. Like its predecessor it offers three different types of image formats. But, best of all, you don't need to rely on the camera manual to pick it up and use it immediately (EDITORIAL NOTE: I had the opportunity to use the camera from 11/20/06-11/30/06 primarily to photograph some of the most impressive Christmas store displays here in New York, NY, and to photograph fellow Brunonian - and former classmate - author Rick Moody at a private reception held in his honor prior to a public event featuring him at the venerable 92nd Street Y. I'm greatly impressed with both the image quality and the realistic color saturation of the images I took using the least amount of .jpeg compression at a maximum pixel size of 8.5 Mb. I am grateful to Leica Camera USA for allowing me to borrow a current production version of this camera.).The Leica D-Lux 3 has approximately the same dimensions and features as its illustrious predecessor (Dimensions (WxHxD) - 4.2 x 2.3 x 1 inches (105.7 x 58.3 x 25.6mm) Weight - 6.5oz / 7.8oz (185g/220g) (without/with battery, memory card and lens cap)). But it is replete with an extensive list of features that weren't available in the D-Lux 2. For example, I believe there is more opportunity for creative manual control via its manual control features. There is also ample flexibility in available apertures for different kinds of photography from wide angle to telephoto (Aperture - F2.8-F8.0 (wide angle) F4.9-F8.0 (telephoto)).  There is also a flexible array of flash options ranging from red eye reduction to second curtain synchronization modes.  And then there is a flexible in image format modes. There is a video recording  mode in which you can choose between 16:9 and 4:3 formats: - In 16 - 9 format a choice between 1280 x 720 pixels 15 fps or 848 x 480 pixels 30 fps/ 10 fps; in 4 - 3 format a choice between 640 x 480 pixels 30 fps/10 fps or 320 x 240 pixels 30 fps/10 fps. Your only limitation is the storage capacity of the SD card you use.  Images can be stored in the following file formats: Still - RAW, JPEG (Fine/Standard), Movie - QuickTime Motion JPEG. Last, but not least, you can dictate the type of digital photography being done and let the camera handle the rest via these scene programs: Portraits, sport, night scenes, night portraits, fireworks, parties, snow, self-portraits, food, high-sensitivity mode, Baby 1, Baby 2, soft skin, candlelight, starry skies, landscapes, print .

Why? maybe because now more people start to realize when their cameras are pretty and feel nice, they get to take it out more often. Some people like to show off with their gadgets. And cameras are absolulte gadgets nowadays. Although many people keep arguing which is better between Panasonic and Leica, however, you must understand it is YOUR choice based on YOUR acquired taste. I have purchased and used both brands. But, why do I keep going back to Leica? I have become more aquired to Leica brand than Panasonic. And somehow, I got end of taking more photos with Leica than with Panasonic. This is completely based on MY experience.Now, for the camera, Leicasonic or Panaleica, both cameras are absolute easy to use.My favorite features are to have 28mm wide zoom lens and 2.8in. wide screen 16:9 ratio LCD screen.First, you can crop and do all other things, but can't zoom out what you took from 35mm cameras.28mm is a perfect rendition to take landscape photos.

It kind of gives some panoramic feel to it.Noise issue has been widely spreaded and severely discussed throughout web forums and journals.However, if you enjoy more outdoor photography like me? wether it's sunny or cloudy, ISO 100 is perfectly good enough.Suggestions: Best place to shop: Amazon, BHphotovideo, Local shops found in Leica website, etc.Best place to look for samples: Leica Camera User Forum, DPReview Leica Forum, or even PBASE website!Conclusion: it is an extraordinary camera from shape to function.

The user interface is very straightforward, the manual seems to have everything you need to know in it, and the pictures are fantastic, sharp and in focus; especially flash assisted pictures.  I can utilize RAW images if I wish, but haven't had to push the camera because the results at lower quality settings are so great.

I had tried to purchase the camera through various camera stores, but was told it was only available online. Ten months after buying it, the lens no longer extends out. Although a prompt told me to remove the lens cap, the lens cap was already off. So I went online and sent an email to Leica Customer Service. It has been over two months now and I have not received a response from Leica.I am currently in London and took the camera to Harrod's where they are licensed Leica dealers. It cost me $60 just to leave it with Harrod's. They called today to say the lens was damaged and that they would have to send the camera to Germany, but that Leica said it would not honor the warranty. There is a good possibility that the repair will cost as much as the camera.My advice is to buy the Panasonic Lumix. They are made in the same factory as the Leica, basically the same camera. And at least with Panasonic perhaps it is possible to get the warranty honored and the camera repaired.To continue this saga. It is now December. Since I wrote the above review, I contacted Amazon via email concerning Leica's unwillingness to honor the warranty because the camera was purchased online in the US. Leica is sold glabally and therefore should honor its warranty no matter where you purchase the camera. Amazon wrote back saying they would help with the warranty. When I wrote again to ask how I should go about it, I did not get another response from Amazon.Harrod's called back to say that to repair the camera will cost me $700, roughly the same amount of money I paid for the camera almost a year ago.Again, if you like the way the Leica D-Lux 3 looks, buy the Panasonic Lumix instead.

D-Lux 3 is a re-badged Lumix LX2. Main asset of both cameras is clearly the Leica VARIO-ELMARIT Lens, quite sharp on both ends. Fascinating is the 16:9 ratio wide panorama mode. 10Mpix is a good resolution, helping to get over the usual noise and noise correction smearing of details, which is visible even at ISO 100. If sampled down to approx. 2-3Mpix size, even ISO 400 images can be still well usable. ISO 800 is a stretch, but no worse than any competition in such small cameras, or rather such small sensors.Of course, all photographers who do not like Jpeg's limited dynamic range are thrilled by the RAW mode! Me too. However, herein I see two issues:1) First, I would like to know the Analog/Digital resolution in bits per pixel. Neither Panasonic nor Leica seem to be capable of or willing to give an answer to this simple question. My impression from conversions in Lightroom is that the dynamic range of the RAW images is barely over the 8-bit range of the jpegs, maybe 9-10bit/pixel effective.2) Panasonic RAW format produces files titanic in size, why not to use DNG like in the L1 camera? The D-Lux 3 produces always *.raw and *.jpg file, and they both occupy whopping 22Mbytes typically. This is over twice as much as in a typical 10Mpix Nikon NEF or Canon CR2 file. Writing of such a vast amount of data takes time: Leica D-Lux 3 needs 3-4sec to store a raw file even to an Extreme III class of SD card, and this clearly renders Leica/Lumix RAW mode useless in all action situations.The LCD display is nice, but it still has a very narrow angle of view. Turn the camera by as little as 30-40 degree, and the colors will strangely change or even reverse.Nonetheless, D-Lux 3 is a nice and handy camera for numerous occasions. Being in the $500..600 class, it opens up the noble marque Leica to many photographers, who would have otherwise not even considered to invest in equipment with the famous red circular logo!

Ironically this camera is lighter than the Lumix TZ3.I also wanted a camera with an excellent lens.This camera choice wasn't difficult (having owned other Leica's, Nikons, Olympus, and CAnons) knowing first hand that the quality of the Leica lenses were a cut above the others.Within 2 days of shooting with this camera I found myself using a few of the manual settings as if they were second nature,like the Auto exposure lock which I found to be a great feature. There was no frustration in attempting to take a shot that the camera wouldn't adjust to.Focusing manually isn't that easy but it isn't necessary to focus manually all the time... It is only needed at those times when the auto focus can't focus on what you want it to focus on.When working on the photos in Adobe Photoshop I was surprised to discover many shots did not require major adjustments or corrections. MY conclusion is the cameras operating software is top notch. Somehow the camera balances color, saturation and contrast, almost to perfection. I found myself making an adjustment and then re-adjusting back to the original over and over again.Shooting with a wide angle lens is a must for me and this camera exceeded my emotional need for space...forground, sky, and the panoramic feel of the 16:9 ratio.My only disappointment is that the mode dial isn't color coded and can't be easily seen without my glasses on like with the TZ3.Having owned this camera for only a month I can say that so far I am very pleased with the results.", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Leica doesn't stand behind its products!", "Author": "S.

My first thought was that I had hit some button that changed the setting so I went online.  What did I discover but that the black screen issue is not an uncommon problem with this camera.  With the naive belief in the integrity and quality of Leica, I sent my camera to their NJ location (as instructed) describing the problem and asking that it be repaired at Leica's expense.  After approximately a week, I received an estimate for repair costing $250 and a statement that the camera was no longer under warranty.  Again, believing that Leica sold a quality product (at a premium price), I called and had several conversations with Carmen Vargas who identified herself as the customer service manager.  Ms. Vargas reiterated that the camera was out of warranty and would not be repaired at Leica's expense.  She offered two alternatives--a 20% reduction of the repair cost, i.e., net of $200, or a discount on the purchase of the successor model, D-Lux 5, for (as I recall) $550, a discount of $250 from the street price of the camera. What a deal!  Ms. Vargas stated to me during one of our calls that it wasn't really worth it to spend money on the repair of my camera which has been discontinued. After telling Ms. Vargas to return the camera (which has been done at Leica's expense) I then emailed that I would be willing to take the upgraded camera for the offered repair cost, i.e., $200.

All I am interested in is a well-built, sturdy product that will capture my vision as I see it, and I cannot always carry around my bulky DSLR, and do not always want too, either.If you want this to be a cheap alternative to buying a full-frame Nikon or Canon DSLR/SLR camera with 15+ megapixels, super-fast lenses, etc. - you'll probably burst a blood vessel because this is a COMPACT, point & shoot camera. It's lightweight, small, stylish, and noninvasive, great for street photography and just everyday picture taking. Considering that Leica's S-line and new rangefinder camera go for no less than $3,000, even used, this is an affordable entrance into a revered brand of high-quality camera makers, and I'm glad I can finally afford to at least get a feel for this iconic cameramaker, even if it is through a little point & shooter.The camera is cute - it's simple and chic, without having a lot of annoying cheap, plastic 'chrome', lightweight yet feels sturdy in the hand, easy to use, and simple to slip into a purse or handbag - but the lens makes it a bit difficult to slide into a back pocket. If you're buying this camera used, spend a few extra dollars and get brand new batteries should it come with the original - they don't have an infinite shelf-life. I remember reading somewhere on the 'net that the camera was 'complicated, and it takes forever to understand everything'. Not true, unless you're absolutely hopeless with anything beyond three buttons and a shutter release. Downloading a free PDF guide to understand a few of the functions isn't a bad idea, but there is hardly anything on this camera that anyone who has ever worked with a regular DSLR cannot understand.Another big complaint? Noise level. I'm a black sheep here saying that this is what attracted me to the camera - the soft, film-like graininess in the photos, especially with the B&W; shots. I love shooting in monochrome and admire film greatly, but am intimidated by it - and I have always found Leica cameras really shine when shot in B&W;, bringing out subtle tones other cameras cannot quite duplicate. While this doesn't quite look EXACTLY like film, this camera has that distinctive cinematic look to it that I find absolutely beautiful, and I find the noise to be more of an asset than a hindrance in retrospect. For color I could see noise being a bit distracting, but if you might melt from the shock of it all, well...In short, this is an excellent compact digital camera - but it is NOT the camera for everyone. If you are more of a technical sort of person - from the ISO to shutter speeds, aperture, etc., I can assure you that you this is not the camera for you. I suggest Fujifilm, Sony, or Canon for that.

I already have a DSLR Canon, so i just needed a small P+S that i could carry around and have my girlfriend use when i'm on the DSLR.Well, after weeks of consideration, I successfully found a near new D Lux 3 on eBay for $450. It had all wires, software, original box, and even a Lowepro case included. I figured it was too good a deal to pass up so I went ahead and jumped on it. In the few days I was waiting for the camrea to arrive, I grew extremely nervous with the amount of negativity there was towards this camera. Then, the day came.After the first few days of using the camera, it is very safe to say that it really depends on the user of this camera to really give it a good review. I wasn't expecting Ansel Adams quality pictures from a P+S in the first place, so my expectations weren't high. But, good gracious this camera really does take amazing pictures. Even at night, i have a flexy pocket tripod at it works wonders. I never have to go about 400 iso, so noise has not been an issue for me. Maybe thats the novice level of photography knowledge I have? who knows.What I do know, is that for a quality picture, this camera blew my mind. It takes as good (at low iso) if not crispier pictures than my DSLR. Again, that may be from my own lack of knowledge since i've taught myself how to shoot and how basic to moderate camera functions. Now, had i paid full price, then YES i would agree with all the naysaying. It is an overpriced camera brand new. BUT the beauty of eBay! at $450, there is no P+S camera that would be able to match the quality images this camera produces.

I did not receive any messege from Leica at all. I tried to call them many times and left my cell number to them, no body called me. They did not concern the small account. After I complain about the bad service from the name brand company, they finally wrote to me. The department found the camera and the problem right away after the mail.
