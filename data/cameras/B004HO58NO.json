I was happy to see that my min pin didnt suffer the usual \"I am a vicious red eyed dog\" look. To compare the usefulness of the flash, I took photos in absolute darkness and then used the flash. It was great to see that the flash really did its thing without the great wash out effect. The flash worked just as well in regular settings that required it.I used the other features for the photos I am going to describe in this paragraph. I work in the buildings behind the World Trade Center so taking pictures of the progress from our office is priceless. On this camera, the pictures are the kind that everyone who visits wishes they could take from this view. I had no light \"bounce back\" from the several floors of newly installed windows on the Freedom Tower (still under construction). The zoom feature is so amazing that I was able to zoom in on a worker cleaning out one of the reflecting pools. It was not a blurry \"it could be anything\" picture, you can clearly see him, the color of his skin, shirt, jeans and the hose he was using. I also have views of the Statue of Liberty, the surrounding islands and New Jersey. I used the zoom on these photos, again, amazing clear detailed photographs.I'm still an amateur when it comes to using this camera but honestly you don't need major brains to figure this guy out. There are several settings for babies, snow, beach, flowers, night etc. Every one of the pictures I took with each of these settings came out VERY nice and clear with no doubt of what you just photo'd. You can take videos and also use the view finder. The camera is able to use any size SD card (I have 16Gs in mine) and standard AA batteries (this one needs four). My advice is get two sets of good rechargeable batteries. It is less expensive in the long run and you will always be ready to capture anything you find interesting.An instruction manual is included for those who may have trouble figuring out certain settings or icons. There are manual settings which are good for those \"professionals\" who are tired of dragging around their heavy telescopes (I see your types when you come to visit us in NYC) around their necks but still want to get that quality shot.In my opinion, this is a serious step up for anyone who still owns a pocket camera because of the quality of the zoom, panorama, pixels and other features that pocket cameras lack.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera with great features", "Author": "Michael Gustafson", "ReviewID": "R3V7AJX96IWZ59", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

It is very easy to switch between the view finder and the display.It takes fantastic pictures and you can use rechargeable batteries if you want.

I was very excited at first because it has similar features as my Panasonic which I like it very much, and this one even includes a PANORAMA function that I thought was awesome.  However, after I tried it out I found out why it is selling with a much lower price than the other similar models: The indoor shots are of very poor quality (as the other reviewer has mentioned, including the consentaneous comment attached to that review).  The outdoor shots are much better but no way great.I give it a three star for the affordable price, and the very easy-to use panorama function (although it does not always result in a smooth wide-angle looking picture, many times the pictures are connected with obvious kinks).", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "After several months of usage;", "Author": "Thy Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R4Z3UH5UGN7HN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read all of the reviews for this camera on Amazon and other sites prior to purchasing.  I'm not a professional photography, but I am a journalist, I need good quality photos from anywhere, anytime.  As far as my photos go?  They're excellent, I mean, you're not going to get magazine ready photos unless you know what you're doing, but there's two automatic settings for amateurs, which is what I use the most because when I'm taking candid photos, I don't really have time to sit there and fiddle with the exposure or anything else.The zoom is for days!  I love it.  They're great for taking photos at a football game, or anywhere you can't be up close and personal.The only bad thing I have to say about the camera is that the battery door IS flimsy.  I saw the comments on it so I was cautious with my camera when I first got it.  Since the memory card is in the same spot at the batteries, you have to open the door to get your photos, but, the camera comes with its cords.  So I make sure I always have my cord with me everywhere and I always use it to take pictures off of my camera.The lens cap is pretty \"flimsy\" too.  The cap itself is fine, but it isn't a cap that you squeeze on the sides so it unlatches and latches to your camera, it just slides on.  Which means it comes off pretty easy.  But, when I'm holding my camera bag in one hand and pulling my camera out with the other.  I don't really have any hand to take the cap off with, so it's nice sometimes to be able to just scoot it off by dragging the lens against the inside of my camera bag.I don't think the camera is very fragile.  I've dropped my camera once because the strap got caught on the corner of a corner when I went to pick my camera up.  It didn't land on the lens though, the bottom of my camera where the batteries are hit the floor, and my door burst open and my batteries rolled everywhere, but everything still works perfectly fine.In all honestly, you could a small, compact digital camera from Sony or even Fuji as well for the same price, and the same quality camera.  But I choose to buy the FinePixS2950 because I like have something sturdy to hold in my hands, and I LOVE the viewfinder.  It's a legit viewfinder, what you see, is what you get.  I had a Sony CyberShot that I loved, but when the screen cracked and I was resorted to using the viewfinder, I noticed if I zoomed in all the way.. my picture was completely off of what I wanted to take a photo of.  This Fuji has an electronic view finder though, which also means I can switch from the LCD screen when it's sunny outside and see what I'm doing.I LOVE my camera, and it's worth the money.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot to use in place of a DSLR", "Author": "Emily", "ReviewID": "REPUHZ5OMGQL6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera after my Sony Alpha a290 was stolen to not necessarily replace it, but to have until I can afford a new one. The camera is a bit bulky, but that is the only con I have. It is great for being on the go because it is still much smaller than a DSLR, and can take beautiful pictures. I mostly use the Macro setting for nature photography, so that was a main reason I chose this camera, and it does not disappoint. It is also great in low-light at night. GREAT BUY!

Cool little camera! If you're not into spending $500+ for a DSLR, this is probably the next best thing. Many functions of a DSLR, but no ability to change lenses. A little slow between photos, but acceptable for the amateur. Quality of photos very good thanks to 14 megapixels. I was surprised at the zoom - 18x, but I guess I didn't realize the power of 18! I'd use the word \"awesome\", but... One of my must-have features was a viewfinder, which is hard to find on point-and-shoot cameras. I find it easier to use, bracing it against your face gives you a steadier hand, and it gives you a more precise view than the screen. The size is perfect - lightweight and easy to carry around. Feels good in hands. Grip allows one-handed shooting if necessary. Videos are clear. Sound could be better, but, hey, the camera is less than $200! A snap to transfer photos/videos to your pc, Facebook, etc. All-in-all, an excellent value. Took this thing to Yosemite twice and got some brilliant photos and videos.

I wanted the wider 28mm zoom on this model, and so I thought I was \"upgrading\".The S2950 uses AA batteries, which are easy to find.  Someone who takes only 300 or 400 photos each year could put in a set of AA lithium batteries, and only change batteries once a year.With \"pre-charged\" AA rechargeable batteries, you can get more than 600 photos per charge without flash, or about 200 photos per charge if you use the flash for every photo. Because the batteries can be recharged several hundred times, you can get several years of use from a set of batteries.In fact, I have found that getting good photos from this camera requires some thought, and some work.  My best results have come from using the \"Aperture Mode\" and locking the ISO at ISO 64 and the Aperture at f/4.  In good sunlight, most photos are reasonably good, although the camera tends to shift blues toward purple, and reds toward orange.Most of my family and friends have dark brown skin tones, which the S2950 shifts toward greenish-brown or orange-brown, especially with flash photos.  The results with paler \"anglo\" skin tones are better, with the camera adding a bit of ruddiness to pale skin that looks attractive.In various auto modes, the results are often poor, as the camera selects ISO 400 even in good light, resulting in photos that are grainy and lack fine detail, contrast, and color saturation.  The solution is to use manual modes, lock the ISO at ISO 64 and f/4.The BIGGEST problem is that my camera has focus problems in temperatures above about 90 degrees.  In Texas, afternoon temperatures stay above 90 degrees from the end of April to the beginning of October.  Shooting outdoors in the summer requires taking each photo two or three times, in hopes that one photo will be sharply focused.The strong point of this camera is that it sells for half the price of comparable Panasonic and Canon cameras.  Among \"Super Zooms\", the S2950 is a real bargain...worth the extra work it takes to get good photos if you want a \"Super Zoom\" and are on a tight budget.Buy it if you are willing to WORK at getting good photos, and you are willing to take a photo two or three times to get one good picture.  However, if you want a camera that you can just turn on, snap away on automatic, and get great results, this is NOT the camera for you.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Target audience apparently not that smart.", "Author": "dpawl31", "ReviewID": "R324KY8ONN2SJJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have to say this.

If you want a standard point and shoot, look elsewhere. to sell this at this price point and afford to put these manual controls, they had to sacrifice somewhere. Buy a point and shoot at this price point with no manual controls you'll be happier if you don't want manual control.Now that that is over with, I'll tell you what's great. Zoom is great especially macro. Having the evf is great for stable shots. photos are crisp, well colored and very detailed. ISO200/400 is great for everyday use. All of this paragraph is referring to full manual mode shooting. Aperture and shutter priority is great as well.Only flaws? Video optical zoom is noisy, and photo ISO noise is rough advice 800.This camera it's not a point and shoot. For the price the manual controls are amazing.

This is especially true at the extremes of camera's operating range.Telephoto photography requires either a tripod or very short exposures. For example without a tripod a shutter speed of 1/250th is required at 9X, and 1/500th at 18X.Macro photography results in a very limited depth of field (i.e. the distance that a 3D object remainds in focus). Another pitfall of macro photography is the motion of either the object or the camera. A tripod or a very steady hand is required. Using the electronic viewfinder and balance your elbows against your torso will help steady the camera.

I have always been a fan of Fuji after previously owning there Finepix F20.  I did a side by side comparison of the photos took by each and there is hands-down no question proof that the S2950 takes much much better shots and is a vast improvement over my antiquated F20. I mean I could visually see how awesome the S2950 is.  Lots of features, half of which I won't use.  The 18x zoom is incredible.  The panorama as others have said is very awesome and very easy to use.  The pictures themselves are very crisp and clear.  The people saying it only takes ok pictures obviously aren't using the correct settings for their situation.  I also like the shutter select option as I plan on taking some artsy waterfall pictures while I'm there.  The pop-up flash is powerful.  This is the first camera I've owned with a pop-up so I've caught myself acouple times forgetting to pop it up. The lens cap as others have said is flimsy. It has yet to fall off but once I put it in a bag I imagine it will.  The battery and SDHC compartment door also seems flimsy, going to have to be careful as you should be any way.

In my opinion there are many misleading reviews for this product. I've been using the camera for a few days without any issues. I actually found the quality of the picture to be quite good, and the shutter time is pretty quick. Sometimes the HD movies have trouble focusing but it didn't seem to be a big disruption.Everyone saying that the camera has lousy shutter times in between pictures, probably has a crappy SD card in it. I went from a microSD card in an adapter (class 2 maybe?) to a class 10 SDHC card. BIG difference in shutter time. It would take about a second in between pictures, now its no more than 1/2 second in between. So if your shutter takes a while in between pictures, get a better SD card. Make sure it has a fast write speed (class 6 or above is best). Fujifilm's site recommends class 4 or higher.As for the picture quality being poor, I've tried my camera in all different lighting conditions. In doors during the day with and w/o flash. Outside during the day, and night with flash. Zoomed in and out. Picture quality isn't GREAT but its very good. I read the manual and tweaked the settings for the picture quality on the camera which seemed to help. Make sure its set to Image size = L(16:9), and Image quality = F (fine). This should give you the best quality pictures with the camera.Bottom line, no this isn't going to be a great camera, but its a very good one for the price range its in.

What I haven't seen mentioned is that the extremes are the only settings one can choose on both Aperature Priority or Full Manual.  In other words, at any focal length, there are only two aperature settings that can be chosen--in the case of the shortest focal length, one is able to choose only F3.1 or F6.4, nothing between.  The other thing of which I was unaware is that, while a specific ISO can be set on Aperature and Full Manual, on Shutter Priority, ISO can be set only on Auto, with a ceiling of either ISO 400 or ISO 800.  I guess this makes sense; since the lens has only two aperature settings, the ISO has to slide to accomodate the partial stop differentials at which the shutter can be set, but that doesn't mean I have to like it.Before I close, I probably should mention that I'm a D-SLR user, used to complete control, who purchased this camera as a convenient option to allow me to take photos without five pounds of camera hanging from my neck.  As such, I might be looking for more than would the average bridge camera purchaser.  On the other hand, my old Kodak 610, which I foolishly gave away, allowed me the ability to set the aperature to any opening across its entire (wider)range, and to set a specific ISO in any photo mode.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it!!", "Author": "Kt", "ReviewID": "R2QOV4KIHR3IXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price, I was a little skeptical that it wouldn't take good quality photos, but I love it, it can do so much and so reasonable priced!", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not an ideal replacement camera", "Author": "Stormy1", "ReviewID": "R3HUNSKXZPWNS9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the Fuji S2950 digital camera in the fall of 2011 and as I have had other Fuji digital cameras with fairly long zooms on their point & shoot cameras, I was disapointed with this camera.

I took this new Fuji S2950 camera to several outdoor events and used the \"automatic\" mode with no flash as it was broad daylight and the pictures mostly were blurred or \"washed out\"....a huge disapointment for me. I had to end up using a much smaller compact Fuji AX300 for my photos for both of those events, even tho the optical zoom on that compact camera was only 5X, their photos turned out much better.If I had to list the pros on this camera, I guess it would be that it's fairly easy to use, has an optical viewfinder, good flash and fairly long zoom. You also get a decent video with this camera in the video mode.Battery life is decent with this camera as it uses 4 \"AA\" batteries.The only con that I have had with this camera is the poor picture quality in any situation.It's a nice-looking digital camera with a decent zoom and plenty of features on it, but it simply did not live up to my expectations as an ideal replacement for my much older and now gone Fuji S1000 digital camera.If Fuji would have spent a bit more time with getting the camera to take a better picture in the Auto mode, then I would have given this camera a better review.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "SUPER NICE CAMERA AT A NICE PRICE!", "Author": "M.

A full DSLR is still a little on the pricey side, but I wanted to get her something with a manual shooting mode and that was relatively easy to use and learn the basics of digital composition on.This camera fits the bill well.  It fits well in hand, and is relatively light, and compact enough to fit in a compact SLR camera bag, so she will actually take it with her places to shoot.  Battery life (as is true of many cameras in this class) was pretty average - meaning she was going through AA batteries quite often.  I'd highly recommend getting a set of Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries or something similar for this camera for best performance and longevity.The user interface and controls on the camera are fairly intuitive, and easy to learn, even for a beginner.  She was shooting in several modes on the first day with great results.  The pictures are good quality, especially coming from the pre-programmed shooting modes.  As one advances, they can certainly customize settings to achieve more precise lighting, focus, and aperture control.All in all, I think this camera will set her up well to progress to a DSLR and more advanced photography if she so chooses.  And if not, the price was at the right price point that she'll have a great camera to take casual photos with!

Cons:-El modo manual no deja ajustar todos los par\u00e1metros.-La tapa de la lente no queda totalmente fija, a veces se destapa sin m\u00e1s.-Precisa de m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n para el f\u00e1cil ajuste de par\u00e1metros.-Creo que no tiene medidor de duraci\u00f3n de bateria.-No tiene memoria interna, requiere una tarjeta SD.A pesar de todo le doy 5 estrellas.Salu2 desde Paraguay", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid Performance", "Author": "P.

Wish I could rate it NO stars.I wanted a camera that runs on AA batteries and has an optical (or electronic) viewfinder. So when on vacation in bright sunny places and my batteries die, I can run into any store, buy standard AA's, pop them in, and use the viewfinder to take priceless memories of loved ones I can't see in the glare of the ubiquitous LCD displays.There only seem to be 5 cameras left in the entire point-and-shoot marketplace that have both features. And only 2 of them under $200.The Fuji FinePix S2940 had a lot of promise. But for three little things.1) Picture quality is POOR. My old 2megapixel Fuji takes better looking pictures.2) Video Quality is worse. It may be full 1280 HD. But the quality is horrible. Gritty and grainy. With no image options available at all. My Canon PowerShot takes great videos with numerous options, including macro. And this Fuji sound quality is far worse than the image quality. It too is gritty. There is a constant white noise present which drowns out any dialog unless the subject is shouting. And it frequently crackles like high-pitched thunderstorm.3) The Battery Door is prone to breakage. It is the same lousy design as my 8-year old 2mp Fuji Finepix. And that one broke after only a few months' use. The worse part is, it's not actually the door that will break. It's the flimsy little retention tabs on the camera body itself that break. The door could be replaced (according to Fuji customer service). But when this bugger breaks, you'd have to replace the camera body. Terrible design. I guess they feel built-in obsolescence is a good thing. Makes you buy more frequent replacements.Well, this POS is going back to the store tomorrow. And I'll buy a Canon or Nikon instead. Even if I can't see what I'm doing on bright sunny vacation days.Hopefully camera manufacturers will wake up and start offering more cameras with back-up viewfinders for when you're not vacationing in a dark cave or rainforest.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointing Results", "Author": "dianeo", "ReviewID": "R2PCQHMR8HE5RC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera because it had a viewfinder.

When I get my money back I'll let you know.I spent three hours playing with this camera and getting to know its features only to find that it has very limited and pathetic features. The quality of the photos doesn't go up when altered. Literally, each setting produced the same quality photo; all of them very low. There was so much noise (and remember, I do this for a living with multiple professional DSLRs. I'm not just blowing smoke here.) that the photo was impossible to use. It's shutter speed alterations did not correctly change shutter speed (At 125 shutter speed I was getting incredibly dark photos with f/3.6 and a 1600 ISO. Ridiculous.) The lens had severe light aberrations in normal sunlight, and while I'm on the topic, the lens zoom didn't adhere to the chosen frame setting. (At a selected 16:9, zooming cropped the screen quality. Why in God's name would it do that!?) The manual ability would have been great if it...well it just wasn't great. 14MP is hardly high quality when it's 14MP of low quality, poorly lit, blurred photos.
