Hart", "ReviewID": "R3D7W5EYMNV90", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was a gift to my wife and she loves it. We are very impressed with the 30x zoom and the quality of the image. It's size is very convenience.One draw back is that it is difficult to hand hold at high zoom. This could be easily compensated for with a Tri-pod, mono-pod or just bracing. However, the proto quality at 30x is still outstanding and clear even if hard to center at high zoom.  We would recommend this camera to our friends.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pleased... but hesitant.", "Author": "T.

The camera box itself did not have the Sony security tape and it caused me unease. BUT...everything seems to be working fine and does not appear to be used in any way. As long as everything keeps working, this has been a great value!", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty good bundle so far, Camera doesn't fit in bag.", "Author": "Dale \"kujospam\"", "ReviewID": "R1UYM769T5K3QC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love the camera.  I have not tested the extra batteries yet, so I'll update the review when I do.  The one major problem that I have is that the camera bag can not hold the camera,  The bag is too small, maybe mine is messed up a little bit, and it looks like it might be in one corner.  I recommend buying a separate camera bag.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3HNYDIXTFSLJ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received my camera only days before I left for a 12 day trip to Israel so I had limited time to \"learn\" it before I left the country.  It delivered in so many ways--took excellent, high quality/resolution shots in a instant's notice, and was able to move easily through the zoom/tele range in a responsive manner.  One thing that I hated---its \"record\" and \"custom\" buttons are where your right thumb wants to naturally sit (especially when taking one handed photos) that it kept screwing me up.  I thought I was going to be able to take a pic, and nothing would happen EXCEPT I'd be recording video (which I didn't want) or have to work my way through the \"custom\" option.  What a pain...sometimes, I'd have to turn the camera off and back on just to get back to where I wanted to be.  While it might just be me, I have to think that these buttons present problems for others too due to their location.Otherwise, the camera performed as promised and I'm VERY pleased with the quality of the photos, which,in the end is why I bought it.", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great deal on the bundle!", "Author": "Bernie", "ReviewID": "R181RF9O6C7YDT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most of the reviews have been about the camera and I concur with almost all of them - great zoom capability (30x), terrific photos, cool features (wifi / remote control / GPS), great video and more or less the same gripes - no Raw capability, not crazy about the manual pop-up flash (wish it was automatic), the display is hard to see in bright daylight but I would still recommend this camera.  The bundle came with a Sony 64GB class 10 memory card, a Sony carrying case (I though it was too small but it works), 2 extra batteries, a battery charger, HDMI cable, screen protector, and tripod.

There is not a chance you could fit the camera into the case provided with the bundle.  I considered the bundle a good value when purchased, however it is a waste of money.

The controls are not as intuitive as I expected but easy to use once you get use to them.  The case I received with the camera was too small.  I emailed Focus Camera about it.  They said that they would look into it but I did not hear from them.  After about one month, I gave them a one star rating.  After that, I did hear from them.  They said that Amazon had packaged the order and not them.
