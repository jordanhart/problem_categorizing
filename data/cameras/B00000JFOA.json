It has a MAJOR drawback though, and I may be returning this camera and buying a different one. The drawback.... It EATS batteries !  A set of Heavy Duty  Alkalines will barely last 20 minutes (even with the LCD display turned  off.)! I bought two sets of 1200 MA rechargeable batteries from Radio Shack  plus a quick charger ($60 worth), and can barely get one set recharged  before the other runs down. Don't count on being able to fill up your 8Meg  flashcard AND download pictures on the same set of batteries!A second  NECESSITY is the AC Adapter. Without this accessory, battery life becomes  even more of a problem.

The quality of the pictures are great, the controls are easy to pick-up (even for someone who is new to photography), and if you bring it to a party---the \"oohs\" and  \"ahhs\" will still be echoing throughout the room hours after you  leave. Two friends, after borrowing and playing with the camera, have since  went out a bought their own (I wanted mine back!). The only grudge I have  is not really against the camera itself, but the company. When you buy the  camera...make sure you also buy a 32mb Smartmedia card (the 8mb card that  comes with it is nothing),  make sure it also *comes with* 4 NiMH  rechargable batteries (the camera is supposed to come with these!), and buy  a Floppy Path Adapter (though optional...makes downloading the images *a  lot* quicker).", "Date": "December 10, 1999"}, {"Title": "Excellent photos; some design oddness", "Author": "S.

The NiMH batteries largely fixed the battery problem (before, I had to carry a pile of spare  alkakines). I'm not sure how Olympus's folks signed off on some strangeness  in the mechanical design (wayward lens cap, oddly-placed strap attachment  things, power switch / shutter button placement). Also, the Flashpath  (floppy) adapter is a major pain to use. The PCMCIA adapter is simpler and  works better. A PCMCIA reader for a desktop PC/MAC is cheap. An included  case would have been nice. Olympus sells one for this camera, but no one  ever has it in stock. I don't even know what it looks like.Having said  that, I'm very pleased with picture quality and ease of use. Resolution and  color are excellent. The automatic mode tends to overexpose flash pictures  taken in some situations (like across a dark room), but the overrides for  shutter and aperature priority work well. You can also fine-tune the  exposure, among other things, and still use the fully-auto mode.Bottom  line: an amazing piece of technology; takes excellent photos (for a digital  camera); very good value for its capabilities.", "Date": "November 21, 1999"}, {"Title": "Good Camera..  for $800 bucks you should get more extras...", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3LE438CIEZGPJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got my camera and it worked well, with impressive results.  I was amazed at the detail in the 1600x1200 medimum compression mode.  Pictures can be enlarged about 400% without noticing grain.However; then I had to  purchase a camera case to keep it in.  (This was very hard to find because  of the odd shape of the camera.  None of the \"off the shelf\" ones  fit well.  I had to settle for one much larger than the camera because of  the odd shape.)  Then after the first 20 pictures I had to replace the  disposable batteries that came with the camera with rechargable batteries  and a battery charger.  (It eats batteries - BIG TIME.)  Then I had to  get a lens cap keeper.  (The camera \"spits\" the lens cap on the  floor if it is left on the camera, when the camera is turned on.)  Then  I had to get an additional 32 meg smart media card.  (Since I wanted to  take more than 8 quality pictures without downloading.)Then I had to get  a USB smart card reader to download the pictures in an acceptable amount of  time without running down the rechargable camera batteries.Now, all I  need to get is a photo quality printer to print some of the pictures that  I've taken......Bottom line,  it took me $1,300+ to get the camera set  up the way I wanted.  I feel the camera case, rechargable batteries,  bettery recharger, lens cap keeper, 32meg smartcard and USB reader should  have been included with the camera...

S. Gilbert", "ReviewID": "RLZVJ3KQJ3S1Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most people don't realize that the best thing about the Olympus C-2000 is that its zoom lens goes from an aperature of f2.0 to an aperature of f2.8. Most people don't even know what an aperature is or why a 2.0-2.8 range  is good. So if you're like most people then let me explain.A lens that  has a 2.0 rating lets in more than twice as much light as a lens with a 3.5  rating, like the Nikon CoolPix 950. Therefore, if you are indoors, and you  want to take a picture without a flash (which is highly recommended to  preserve natural-looking colors instead of washed out pictures of people  with red eyes), then the Olympus C-2000 is definitely the best camera.  Also, the C-2000's form factor is better than Nikon or anybody else. The  camera is small and light, and feels well-made as you hold it. The Nikon  however feels flimsy and the zoom responds slower. The Nikon is in two  pieces as well, connected by a swivel joint. That seems more likely to  break, and I don't see why having a swivel joint is important or  useful.Overall, in my two years of working at a camera store, the C-2000  is the first digital camera to deserve true merit. It's well priced and has  image quality comparable to models costing ten times as much. Also the lens  is a high quality aspherical Olympus element. I wouldn't recommend anything  else.jonathan s gilbert", "Date": "September 13, 1999"}, {"Title": "Great Value, Great Features = \"Great Camera\"", "Author": "D. R.

The 2020 Z can be had for about the same $$$ as the 2000. The lack of sound when recording quicktime movies isn't really a concern. I think I'll  wind up buying a Sony digital 8mm camcorder soon anyways...I also bought  a microtek CameraMate smartmedia card reader (USB) to hook up to my PC. Had  to upgrade the PC from win95 to 98 though, in order to activate the usb  ports.I bought an additional 32MB smartmedia card and a Flashpath floppy  adapter, as well. The flashpath works just fine, but it's slow. Also, you  have to install the special flashpath software before using it, which  Olympus does not tell you in advance. So you need to keep the software with  you if you want to be ready to move files to \"any\" pc. Other than  that, it's OK. I mostly got it for ease of connectivity between my home and  work pc's, laptop, etc.For the price of the C2020Z, the flashpath  adapter should be included, as well as the case. expect to shell out  another c-note if these are important to you. It would also be nice if  Olympus had designed a special one-piece battery for the 2020Z, as many  manufacturers do. Transferring the four AA-size batteries in and out each  time for recharge is a pain in the neck.Overall, these are minor gripes.

When my wife and I were researching this buy  we decided against disk storage camera's (our friends have them) because  the disk drive is just something else to eat the batteries.  Also the  C-2000 can take a 32MB smart media card which greatly increases picture  capacity at higher resolutions -  about 489 standard, 64 high, and 32  TIFF...it will take about 120 standard with its included 8MB card.  I  already upgraded the card and bought an AC adaptor (not included)...and the  charger for the batteries is on the way.  I will not use alkaline batteries  again.  Right now I am using lithiums and I am seeing about a 4-5X greater  life over alkaline.  My friends who had digital said that it is better to  not take pictures using the LCD screen...I agree, we use the view-finder,  then check the pictures with the LCD (eats the batteries).  I am sure I  will be happy with this camera for years.  Good advice is to read the whole  instruction book right away, the camera does a lot more than I thought it  would.  By the way, we bought the camera in a retail store (going on  vacation, wanted it NOW) and even with comparision shopping we now wish we  got it on-line.

It makes sharing pictures with friends as you take them so much fun, and if the picture is poor, you can erase it and make another.  I have experience with cameras for 50 years,  and I know the technical stuff pretty well.  This camera has the  flexibility of a good SLR with a 35-105 zoom.  I bought a cheaper Olympus  without an optical zoom first. That camera was fun for a beginner, but a  true optical zoom makes this a dream of a machine. Put a lens cap saver on,  tuck the camera into a small waistpouch, and enjoy a quality camera with  great portability.  I take it everywhere.  Also, get an AC adaptor and  battery charger.  The 32mg card holds over 60 photos in the compressed HQ.  I love it!  PCMagazine (Nov. 16, 1999) rates it higher than the Nikon  Coolpix 950 for the serious photographer. Of course, the big plus is being  able to manipulate the photo in an editing program like the included  PhotoDeluxe or even better in Photoshop. I enjoy importing the pictures  into a program like Printmaster and making montages of picture shoots.

I like the Kodak controls better, but  the Olympus fits my hand well.  The power switch on the Olympus is where  the shutter should be, and, the menu commands (such as delete last picture)  are not terribly intuitive.  Also, the flash is closer to the lens than the  Kodak, so red-eye is more of a problem.  But, the 3x zoom makes the  difference for me, we'll learn how to use the controls.  Definitely get  a USB PC Card reader to move the pictures to your PC, the serial connection  is VERY slow.  Finally, Olympus makes the mistake of giving you regular  alkaline batteries in the box.

I was was very happy with it, got many high resolution pictures with an excellent color reproduction. I got my C-2000 because I wanted the next  generation features in a smaller package. C-2000 preserves the high quality  of the optical 3X zoom subsystem, while making it smaller. I like the new  1600 by 1200 pixel resolution, since I print a lot of 5x7 and 8x10  pictures. The color reproduction is excellent, as good as a 35mm film. The  new electronics in the camera is impressive: much more memory, faster  processor, more sensitive CCD. Now, I am able to take multiple pictures in  a burst mode, a useful feature when there is a lot of action. I delete the  frames I don't need at the later time. Also, the time between taking single  pictures is much shorter, especially if flash is not used. The new CCD  makes it much easier to take pictures in the low light conditions. A lot of  digital cameras have difficulties auto-focussing in these situations. I  also like the new feature of being able to play the slide show directly to  the TV through a video output on the camera. It is great for parties,  especially with kids. They like to see themselves on the TV, only minutes  after the picture is taken. I got the 32MB SmartMedia memory card. The  included 8MB card is OK, but the capacity is insufficient for high-res  pictures. (Make sure you get SmartMedia, not the incompatible Compact  Flash. Some Web sites don't know the difference!). This memory stores 64  pictures in the 1600x1200 high quality mode, or 32 pictures in the  1600x1200 super high quality mode (JPEG compression of higher quality, but  requires more storage). I find both to be excellent, but prefer SHQ mode  for 8x10 printing. I got the USB Smart Media reader. It transfers the  content from the memory card to the PC much faster than the serial port or  a floppy adapter. You notice the difference when you transfer 32MB worth of  pictures! An improvement needed: the C-2000 needs separate buttons for some  commonly used controls, such as flash, focussing style, macro mode etc. It  is much harder to go through a menu to get to change some of these  settings. D-600L used to have this feature. Overall, I am very pleased with  the C-2000.

This camera is the only one that has all of the features that I wanted:  zoom lens, high enough resolution for 8x10\" photo printing, ease  of use, small size, comfortable grip, and the ability to attach external  lenses and filters.I was able to purchase this camera in time for a  vacation to San Francisco and I have no regrets.  It worked perfectly and  captured an amazing variety of photos in very challenging situations.  Each  8Mb flash card holds 122 `internet quality' jpeg pictures that look decent  printed on as a 4x6\" picture.  They look great on the computer screen.  The  really high quality 2Mpixel shots that look fantastic printed as an 8x10\"  print take a lot more space.  You can store 7 of them compressed (jpeg) or  just 1 not compressed (tiff) on one 8Mb flash card.What I liked: Powers  on fast so that I can take quick action shots, light weight and balanced  feel, 3x zoom lens, external lens and filter adapter available, LCD display  refreshes fast and is accurate, all adjustments can be controlled manually,  takes great pictures automatically, video cable is included and makes great  slide shows on the go, takes wonderful pictures in very low light  conditions, and it includes software to stitch together panoramic picture  sequences.What I didn't like: It takes about 10 minutes to download a  full flash card on the serial computer cable and the power button is too  close to the shutter button (oops, I hit the wrong one again).  You can  purchase a high speed flash card reader to attach to your computer to speed  up the download process.  Can't do anything about that power button except  train your fingers.Accessories I purchased and recommend you get: Extra  flash cards, NIMH high capacity batteries with a slow charger, the optional  external lens adapter, and a circular polarizing filter.  The extra flash  cards give you the option of taking more pictures in one outing.  The high  capacity batteries will make your life easier with less battery changes. I  recommend that you avoid buying a fast 1 hour charger for your batteries.  They apply too much current, make the batteries hot during charging, and  don't deliver a full charge.  Try an 8 or 16 hour charger instead.  They  aren't as rough on your expensive batteries and usually do a better job of  charging to full capacity.

Good quality construction  and switch feel, solid feeling (no flex in the body), battery life is good  (with the free NiMH batteries), the floppy adaptor works well (but low  batteries on the adaptor can confuse by manifesting themselves as a  malfunction), the 32 MB card is plenty even for auto-show type massive  picture-taking.  Saved me a bunch in film and developing costs (I work on  my car and take lots of pictures all the time).In short, at this price, I would buy it at once if I did not have access to it at work.", "Date": "June 2, 2000"}, {"Title": "a great product, but what to do about a carrying case?", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3REGPV7S9680J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

This camera rules!!  The quality of the pictures is amazing-my prints look fabulous.  One complaint-this camera eats batteries for a living!  Make sure you buy the  rechargeable batteries (I think the camera should have shipped with  rechargeables).

Camera is light and small, could actually be a little larger to make it easier to handle.  One should invest in a couple of 32mb Smart Media Cards - I highly recommend  Alix Memory Cards (800 580-6940) - they are competitively priced and offer  top notch service.  Also I recommend their Universal Photo Reader, it's  alot faster than using the cable that comes with the camera.  Your computer  treats it as another hard drive and transferring photos could not be  easier.  I didn't really like the photoediting software that came with  the camera, I went right back to using Ulead PhotoImpact.  You'll need to  get a good battery charger and a couple sets of recharable batteries - this  is a must.  Photo quality is outstanding for shorter range shots.  I found  that when shooting landscapes, the images were not as sharp as I would have  liked.  An advantage of the camera is that you have the option to manually  set alot of the settings, just like a regular 35mm camera, all the other  digital cameras in this price range that I researched did not as many  manual setting options. Cons:  When one is using the viewfinder to take  a photo it is easy to press the power button instead of the shutter button.  You'll need a strap to secure the lens cover to the camera strap, otherwise  it'll be lost in no time.  The camera comes with only an 8mb Smart Media  Card, I think the standard should have been 16mb.", "Date": "July 13, 1999"}, {"Title": "Excellent images, very flexible, some user problems", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2O5OHRHR468MY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've found the C-2000 to be an very good camera, taking excellent photographs. The clarity is very high, no major distortion of images, some lens flare, very responsive. No one at work was able to tell that I had  used a digital camera instead of 32mm. Very good in low-light with or  without flash. You can definately see that Olympus has been in the  photographic business for a long time and has brought its high standards to  the digital camera world.It has a couple of drawbacks though: 1) The  lens-cap must be removed before turning the camera on because the lens is  going to extend itself about two inches while taking pictures. That makes  it too easy to lose. Spend $1.00 and buy a lens-cap-keeper. 2) Not quite as  close-focus as the Nikon CoolPix 950. Definately spend the money on NiMH  batteries! As with all digital cameras you'll go through a set of alkalines  every 16 frames while NiMH will last through hundreds.", "Date": "July 13, 1999"}, {"Title": "Needed parts", "Author": "Daman Allen", "ReviewID": "R2BCLP165JUZZ4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera is old and uses an outdated memory card system.

I've also found that my  batteries tend to last 10-15 minutes longer than friends who own different  digital cameras (even when I use the LCD display constantly).The  included software is helpful, but I find that I am using Microsoft  PhotoDraw 2000 in tandem with my camera rather than the included Adobe and  Camedia applications.The only real beef that I have with the C2000 is  the location of the power button.  The power button is located in the  position where you would expect to find the shutter button, which leads to  some comedic moments when you line your family up for a picture, tell 'em  to smile, and then mistakenly turn off the camera.It's a small price to  pay for a truly amazing piece of technology.
