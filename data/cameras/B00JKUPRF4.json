It just doesn't look like it would house a telephoto lens - especially an 18-300mm lens.  Upon opening the box, it is indeed a small lens for what it is.  It's weight is 550 grams compared to the hefty 828 grams of the original 18-300mm lens it replaces.  550 grams is also about the same weight of the 18-200mm lens.  This newer lens is lighter, smaller and less expensive than the lens it replaces.I replaced and sold my 18-200mm, and my 55-300mm for this one.It is true, and I was a bit mystified, that this lens does not come with a lens bag or a lens hood.  But on the other hand, the Nikon lens bags do nothing to protect the lens in any way.  So I always buy my own.  And as far as the lens hood goes, ken Rockwell recommends you leave it home anyways when using this lens.I've taken a few shots and the images are impressive to my non-technical eyes.  I believe, as my research concludes, that this lens is just as good if not better than the lens it replaces,If my review was helpful, and I hope it was, please choose the yes option in the comments section below.  Thank you.

I used it that day and the next and so far I am very impressed. I'm using it on a D300. There are purists that will say that all super zooms are garbage, but I've been shooting as a hobbyist since the 60's and this is the best zoom lens I've ever had. Very sharp, with fast and accurate focusing. I was trying to decide between the previous (heavier) Nikkor 18-300 and the forthcoming Tamron 16-300, then this lens came along. I think I made the right decision.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great lens... despite it's versatility.", "Author": "Tim S.", "ReviewID": "R2JRQ0W0S8P5G0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Outstanding lens! Super sharp, fast accurate focusing (even in low-light) and lightweight!I initially bought this lens specifically for walking around street photography use. But after just coming off a three day nature and landscape shoot with the 18-300, I'm thoroughly impressed. What stood out to me (other than obviously not having to keep changing lenses), was the fast accurate focusing, especially in low-light situations. The 18-300 was amazing in this category! There were many times I was sure the focusing would be off, but I was wrong. I was pleasantly surprised to see that all my images were (at the responsibility of the lens) razor-sharp.Then there's the convenience. Concentrating on getting the shot, and not having to constantly change lenses IS everything it's cracked up to be. Although not my intentions, during the entire three days I never brought my 16-85 or 70-300 out of the bag. Didn't need to. The only other lens I used was my Nikon 10-24. Yes, the 18-300 is a tad slower at the longer length than my 70-300, but I never missed the small difference. And did I mention the light weight of the 18-300?The only slight negative was a little lens creep. But the 18-300 has a lock for this if needed.I have eight other Nikon lenses, and this lens is so good, this is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review.So, my recommendation: Don't listen to all the \"holier-than-thou\" critics on the Nikon forums that claim this lens is a waste of Nikon time. No, it's not a \"professional lens\" not a 2.8 and it doesn't cost thousands of dollars. But it's a damn great lens. You won't be disappointed. Needless to say, I certainly wasn't.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great lens as always from Nikon", "Author": "islandsound", "ReviewID": "R2Z6KREHU7VZAB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted this for a trip that is coming up so I don't have to change lenses constantly. I do like to limit myself to fixed focal length lenses but when you want an all in one as your go to lens this is the best one to get. This is almost the exact same size and weight of the 18-140 that is also an awesome lens but I personally wanted something with a longer focal length and was an all in one solution. Nice and balanced, fast accurate focus, great zoom and all around if this is the only lens you have I can't see how you will be disappointed. This is a nice addition to my ever growing assortment of lenses. I often contemplate going with something off brand but always come back to Nikon lens for my D7100.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good lens!", "Author": "Igor Sorokin", "ReviewID": "R11AG0HR6YQEOR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the lens 2 days ago and made several photos outside and indoor using it on Nikon D7000 in P mode. It is not bad. It is not 'super' either. The focus feels a little slow (maybe because it is quiet?). It is sharp. The color and contrast are good. The image is almost perfect in sharp areas. As soon as it gets less sharp it gets noisy especially at max zoom.  I also own Sigma 18-250mm (very good lens). The bokeh on Nikon is not as pleasant as on Sigma (it looks smudged). Nothing can obviously bit the range. Overall I rate at as 'good'.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Impressed!", "Author": "David Johnson", "ReviewID": "RFSVOMVRCTYC9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this lens yesterday and immediately mounted it to my D7100. Already I've taken in excess of 50 images. I traded a 18 -200mm NIKKOR that I had on my D90 and then D7100. This new lens improves upon everything the 18-200mm did well. It's much sharper at 300mm (max zoom) than the 200mm (max zoom) ever was. Even at 18mm the images are sharper at the edges than the 200mm was. With minimal post processing the images pop! It's a little pricey, but I'm sure I'll keep it as long as I did the 200mm. No comment on video as I haven't explored that yet. For the most part I still use my video camera for video. I highly recommend the new NIKKOR 18-300mm", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "ACCESSORIES NOT INCLUDED", "Author": "Jonathan A Brown", "ReviewID": "RUC3BIGGQK40E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received the lens so this review is only about what was not included.

Mcguire \"dennis\"", "ReviewID": "R2TOUVAFUR0H98", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very nice lens and I love its versatility.  The only problem that I have with it is trying to focus on something when zoomed into 300 mm.  I probably need to read the manual a little closer to see if I can focus on one small thing when zoomed in completely.  I haven't had the lens very long and haven't read up on all of its capability.  I did however take a trip across country for two weeks and I did get some amazing photos with it.  Overall I am happy with the lens mostly because of the versatility of being able to shoot at 18 mm and 300 mm with one lens.  It may seem heavy to some, but for what it does and its compact size, I don't think it can be beat.", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this lens!", "Author": "Candace in Phoenix \"Art Historian\"", "ReviewID": "R2XJYQ5YHODNYT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my lens for about 3 weeks now. It's slightly heavier than the 55-200mm that I had been using the most prior to this purchase but now I've gotten used to it and it doesn't bother me at all. I am so happy to not have to change lenses outside to get a wide-angle view anymore and I am enjoying getting better close-ups of birds and butterflies with the 300mm focal length.At first, I wasn't sure of the bokeh as it only opens up to f/6.3 when you're at 300mm but now I like it quite a bit. It's slightly different but the autofocusing is fast and sharp and the subjects are very crisp and detailed. I've gotten some gorgeous shots. Even at 300mm, I haven't experienced shake, thanks to the VR.It is somewhat odd that no bag is provided but all my other lenses have bags so as long as there is always a lens on my camera, I don't need another bag and I'm pretty sure this is the lens that will be on my camera 95% of the time anyway.This is the most I've ever spent on a lens--although I realize that lenses can be far more expensive--but I'm glad I splurged because I'm so happy with the results.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nikon 18-300 Lens", "Author": "Don D", "ReviewID": "R229TC4G16TFQ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Lens is very clear and takes excellent photos but at 18MM i get vignetting  which is a little frustrating.I really do like the zoom to 300 mm.  ( I also have a 18-270 Tamron which I like as well, but get a similar effect of vignetting).I like that the Nikkor lens stays where I set the zoom as opposed to the Tamron which tends to slide in and out without my assistance).I do recommend either of the lenses if you keep in mind the Tamron is about 60% of the cost of the Nikkor.The Nikkor does seem to be a little clearer.  So it is a trade off.What I like about either of these is the fact I do not have to change lenses and open my cameras to the environment as often.", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Lens", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R20140529ABYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was continually swapping from 18-70 and 70-300 lens.

I'm pushing 800 pictures since I got the lens, and I've very satisfied with it.
