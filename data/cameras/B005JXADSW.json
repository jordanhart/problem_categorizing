{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Maybe slightly ahead of its time; make sure you can play HD", "Author": "plyopowerd \"Arrow Dynamic Mom\"", "ReviewID": "R25XKR8P4CIDFF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own several devices for recording and playing digital videos: a Flip MinoHD, a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH5 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 2.7-Inch LCD (Black), a Palm Pixi smartphone and an older Sony miniDV tape camcorder (disclosure: the Flip and Panasonic cameras were Vine freebies) and now this Philips Qvida camcorder, also from Vine.  They all have their optimal uses: the Flip is good for casual at-home or near-home videos since it has no card slot for additional memory; the Lumix is good for traveling since it does have a card slot and can be recharged by AC, but has no zoom; the Sony is good for taping TV shows, and the phone, also zoomless, is good for quick on-the-fly videos like a celebrity sighting on the street.Where does that put the Philips? Pretty much like a Flip with a card slot, larger and more versatile screen and a choice of video resolutions - full 1080p HD, \"sports\" 720p HD or standard def. It also has features like snapshot mode, dual recording (recording HD and SD at the same time - handy if you need to email or upload a video, since the HD files are huge), 3 second pre-recording and onboard editing (you can trim the beginning or end of the video).What I liked:- The large flip screen is very versatile; you can flip it out and turn it 90 degrees counterclockwise for recording someone else, turn it another 90 degrees and flip it flat against the body for video viewing, or turn it 90 degrees clockwise for recording yourself, like for a blog or YouTube rant.- The screen tells you if you're recording in full HD, SHD or SD, and how much time you have remaining.- The batteries seem to last awhile, and the unit automatically turns on when opened, and shuts off after a few seconds when closed.- You can take snapshots or videos with a flip of a switch.- The video trimming and pre-recording features work well.- The HD videos look great on my HD TV (but see below).- Sound is very good, whether played back on TV, the computer, the camera or YouTube.What could be improved:- The touch screen, as others have noted, can be hinky, and there's no alternate button control.- Touch screen menus can be confusing and hard to control.- The record/zoom control is poorly designed; three separate buttons would have been much better.- Controls in general can be hard to figure out without downloading and studying the user manual. I discovered, after a few weeks, that playback volume is controlled with the zoom switch.- Snapshots tend to be blurry.- No cover for the lens means it can easily be scratched.- \"Wide\" isn't very wide; you'll need to step way back to film a group (a shortcoming for the Flip as well)What you need to consider before buying:- A lot of computers choke on HD videos if they don't have a fast processor or suitable video card. If you can't play HD videos from YouTube then you'll probably have problems with these HD videos. I can only play HD videos on my 1080p HDTV, not on any of my computers. (That's where the dual recording comes in handy)- You'll need to buy a micro SD card to record anything, and you'll need a mini-HDMI-to-HDMI cable to link the camera to your HDTV unless it has a USB input.Edited and updated 4/17: The dual recording DOES work! The dual videos didn't appear on the camera's screen, but when I plugged it into the TV, the dual videos appeared. I also added a 4th star because I've really gotten to like this camera, and have pretty much retired the Flip. The full HD videos I took of outdoor activities on a sunny day, look spectacular on a big-screen HDTV!  If they could tweak the controls (starting with that record/zoom switch) and make them more intuitive, this would be a winner.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "OK Flip-Style Camera, but Touch Screen Is Not Worth the Price Bump", "Author": "Joseph \"jck09\"", "ReviewID": "R26LRPIIH25FXN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Summary:  This is an OK but not jaw-dropping videocamera along the lines of the older Flip cameras.  Many people may have a phone that takes good enough video to make something like this surplus.  If you need a light camera to carry along in case you want to take basic video, this is good, albiet with some weird design choices.  However, I don't think the touchscreen adds much, so if you're interested, consider a non-touchscreen version.Note: For some reason, the description of this product currently says that the camcorder has 4x optical zoom.  It doesn't have optical zoom at all.  It has 5x DIGITAL zoom.What's good:+ This takes pretty good video at up to 1080p resolution.  The anti-shake feature seems to work pretty well, and the fold out screen is handy for taking video from weird angles, like holding the camera above your head to get a shot from the middle of a crowd.+ The camera is very compact and comes with a carry bag.  It's light enough that you could drop it in your bag and forget it.+ I like the 3 second feature.  Basically, if you have it set and have the unit on, then it keeps a constant 3 second buffer.  When you hit record, the unit uses that buffer to start your recording 3 seconds before you actually hit the button.  This isn't always helpful -- you need to have the unit on and your shot framed or else you will get either nothing or 3 seconds of your shoes, but when you're tracking something and waiting for the right shot, it's kind of cool.What could be better:- As I said, the touch screen feature is forgettable.  I didn't find it any easier to use than button based menus from other cameras.- While the still photo feature is handy, I thought the color balance on still photos looked a little washed out.  This wouldn't be my first choice for still photos -- in a pinch, I would probably just use my phone, even with less resolution.- I didn't have problems with my hand covering the lens or flash like some reviewers, but do have one major design gripe.  The record button is placed right in the middle of the zoom in/out rocker.  This has caused me to stop recording more than once when I tried to zoom in or out but accidentally touched the record button.- This doesn't have replaceable batteries, so if the built in rechargeable battery runs out, you're done for the day.  It recharges through a pop-out male usb plug, which wouldn't be my preference.  If you have a laptop, the unit sits right on your desk next to your laptop while recharging, but if you want to recharge from a power adapter or a tower computer, either you have to have the whole unit dangling out in space, which will probably break your usb port sooner or later, or you need to buy a male to female USB cord.  I have about a million male/male, but am not crazy about buying one more cord for my cord menagerie.- Lastly, the on-board memory is so small as to be useless.  You will need a microSD card to do more than test it.Conclusion:  IMHO, this is a little too much for a throwaway videocam, but not quite enough for a serious family camera.  If you want something for casual videos, I recommend you use your phone or buy something more basic, like the Philips CAM110BL/37.  If you want a camera to preserve family memories, I would consider the next step up to a Sony HDR-CX160 High-Definition Handycam Camcorder (Black), which has the same quality high def video with much better zoom.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "The definition", "Author": "Henry Colmenares", "ReviewID": "R1VKD7A5C4TBGG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the definition of this camera is regular.

This camera provides 1080p videos but NOT 1080p quality videos.  In other words, just because the videos are 1080p in dimensions does not mean that it was recorded that way.  It's no different then if you wer eto take a video from your iphone and then use video conversion software to enlarge the video to 1080p instead of 720.  (It's like taking silly putty and pressing it on a comic strip, then stretching it out, then telling people that the comic strip was that big.)The USB connector that pops out at the bottom will now NOT stay back in so I am forever with a camera that has this stupid little USB thingy sticking out the bottom.  Which means that now it won't even go into the little felt case that comes with it all of the way.I thought that it's sideways grip might be a good thing but nah.  By holding it that way, when you move your thumb to press a button, it tends to want to slip off the palm.  So you don't really have a free hand when using this.  Even more difficult if you are left handed like me.BUY A MICRO SDHC or you only get about 8 seconds of HD video!  Don't say I didn't warn you.BUY A USB EXTENSION or otherwise, try sticking this thing in a USB port while hanging in mid air (unless you have a laptop or a USB hub that is laying flat)  Luckily, I had a spare cord laying around.I didn't give it just 1 star because overall, it's worth the $70.

It does say microSD compatible, but it's a bit deceiving for the consumer.IN FACT, this product page description states that the following:\"For convenience, the card slot on the camcorder takes universal microSD cards, letting you expand the memory up to 32 GB, which will store up to 8 hours of full high-definition video or 32 hours of standard-definition video.\"Really, Philips, really?  \"Letting you expand the memory\" ?? It's more like, if you want a video that is longer than 15 seconds (no typo!) then you will essentially be forced to purchase a microSD card or this thing is useless.FURTHERMORE, this product page description also states:\"For HDTV viewing, an HDMI output offers a direct connection to HDMI-enabled televisions.\"This statement is very deceiving!In actuality they should have said it provides a mini-HDMI output, whereby now you must purchase a mini HDMI to regular HDMI adapter.  And no, mini-HDMI cables are not ubiquituous at Walmart or Target.  Really, Philips, you couldn't have just made the slot just a little bit bigger to take real HDMI cables?LASTLY, the camera and video recording quality is very dismal (dark) even in a brightly lit room.  In fact, I will state that the camera phone in my phone and my wife's phone has better quality video.Get the FLIP CAMCORDER while you still can - I realize Cisco purchased Flip and then decided to can the entire consumer line of Flip, but for 1/2 to 3/4 the cost of this Philips camcorder, you can get a fine 720p to 1080p HD camcorder with an *included* cable that hooks up to REGULAR HDMI and built in 60-2 hours worth of HD recording (again, you don't have to go out and buy a microSD card).  Also, my Flip works great in non-ideal lighting, far, far better than this Philips.So in summary:1. You will need to purchase a microSD card, in addition to the pricey cost of this camcorder2. Philips does not provide the \"mini\" HDMI cable to hook it up to an HDTV; other manufacturers do provide an included cable to connect to HDTV; Philips should have included one.3.

The other thing I don't care for is the usb plug.  It pops out of the bottom of the unit and is what you plug the unit into your computer with to download your videos and images and to recharge the battery.  I don't care for it because the entire weight of the unit is being held up on this plug.  It would not take much to damage the unit.  I also wonder how long it will last.

The audio quality in videos isn't bad either.Okay, now the not so good!  First off, it just somehow feels weird to hold.  It's hard to press the record button and not cover the lens, as another reviewer noted.  It just somehow seems designed by someone who never actually gave it a try and saw this flaw.  It has almost no internal memory, only enough for about a 10 second video, and it requires a micro SD card, which is not something most people have around.  I had planned to use a standard SD card from an old camera for this, as most cameras accept, but no dice.  The still pictures I tried taking were just awful.  There might be some trick I haven't mastered, but the non-user-friendly nature of the instructions and the odd touch sceen make this hard to figure out.  The GUI is quite confusing.  The directions helped almost not at all.  They seemed aimed at non-readers, with pictures with lots of arrows and the like.We have an old Flip, which is easy to use, has internal memory and takes some pretty nice films.  I thought this camera would be a huge upgrade, but it just doesn't seem to be.  Maybe with lots and lots of tweeking and good luck, we could get it to take okay videos, but it's not going to be very easy.One other note--to charge the battery, you plug the whole camera into the USB slot, the same thing you do to upload videos.  However, it's pretty awkward to do this to charge it, at least on our computer.  The camera hangs off the front of the computer, and any stray kid or cat could probably knock it out of charging and to the ground.  Other devices have a cord to avoid this, but not this one.Overall, kind of a disappointment.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad form-factor - Definitely not a FLIP replacement", "Author": "R. Hammer \"rhammer\"", "ReviewID": "R3DFK7F8JXJZBJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "With t-ball season right around the corner, the wife and I were excited to try the new Qvida 1080p video recorder from Philips.  We had been utilizing the Flip camera for years and have loved the form-factor and simplicity of operation surrounding the Flip.  Since the Flip was discontinued by Cisco this seemed like a nice replacement and a move into the 1080p world.Out of the box the Qvida seems to have that same portability and size that we enjoyed with the Flip.  Unfortunately that's where the similiarities end and the disappointment began:DISLIKES:- Did not realize that this item required MICRO-SD cards to record to.  The Flip had internal memory so there was no accidentally forgetting to insert a memory card or having to buy a new memory card (i have never used Micro SD cards, and the plethera of SD cards I do have won't work in this unit).  So out of the box I couldn't even use the video recorder.- Holding this item in my hand is so awkward.  The camera fits in your hand like holding a cell phone sideways with the slim edge in your palm.  It is difficult to hold for a long time and your hand develops fatigue quickly (which adds to shake in the video).- Your thumb naturally rests on the power button.  I saw this potential issue while looking at the box, but didn't realize it was going to be such a big issue.  You have to use your thumb to push the record button and push the zoom up and down (which sits above and below the record button).  A couple times I would accidentally push the record button while trying to zoom (which stops the recording!!).  So I made an effort to keep my thumb out of the way.  So if you're right-handed your thumb will sit on the left side of the camera's body.  Take a look at the product picture and you'll notice that the power button sits right on the left side where your thumb would go.  I've had a couple of accidental pushes of that as well.- The touch screen is difficult to manipulate.  I agree with some other reviewers that the screen has a difficult time recognizing touch input.  I have regular sized hands for a man so I don't have fat fingers which would cause multiple touches.  There is genuinely something wrong with the screen that it doesn't recognize simple touches from fingers.  All menu options are contained within the touchscreen menu so not being able to navigate the options easily makes setting up and maintaining the video/photo library difficult.- Video Quality was no better than my IPHONE 4S videos.  A dedicated video camera should come to the table with better performance out of the box than your cell phone.  This is not the case here.So not to be completely biased in this review there are a couple nice touches:- Just like the flip this model has the flip-out USB connector which makes charging and downloading videos easy.- A fold out screen is a nice touch and makes following the action as the screen is bigger than the Flip.All in all, avoid this unit.  Your cell phone (which I'm sure you already own) provides just as good of video and photos without having to carry around another item.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Avoid It - A Complete Disaster", "Author": "Bradford Schmidt", "ReviewID": "R13S3YRMPOPO9R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like this camera. For some reason I root for Philips to produce quality products, and I'm always looking for a dark horse to win a market segment. And at first glance, the specs seem great and the features are well worth using.But it's just awful in so many ways.First, a basic data point: there's almost no on-board memory, as there is in a Flip. Now, I know many of these types of cameras don't have on board memory, but at this price point, there should be more than 14 seconds of recording time built in.Beyond that, they've decided to use microSD cards for storage, so if you have plenty of standard SDHC cards (as many of us do) you're out of luck. You'll need to spring for a new microSD card, unless you want to pull one out of your phone (this is the only piece of equipment I have that uses microSD outside of my phone). Oh - and NOWHERE on the box does it say you need a memory card of any kind, much less what type. Not as big an issue here where at least the type of card is mentioned - though the lack of on-board is not - but I really pity a retail customer who gets sucked in unknowingly.But these are minor issues that could be excused it it was a pleasure to use. Sadly, it so completely isn't.To begin with, the touchscreen is effectively unusable. I can't believe how many manufacturers seem to be willing to put a horrible touchscreen on their equipment just to be able to use the buzz word. The problem with this one is that the areas that need to be touched to do most things (like, um, change from \"night\" to \"indoors\", or switch effects, or set the date, or hit PLAY to watch a video, or SELECT a video) is so tiny (little arrows) that it simply can't be used.And I don't mean they can't be seen - they're easy to see.  I mean if you touch it with something bigger than a stylus (none are included, nor is there a place to store one) it rarely registers a touch, instead sitting there non-functional and mocking the user. I've tried hitting a button 10 times in a row, swiping, touching hard, touching soft, touching and holding, and it won't do anything. My wife tried. My kids (small fingers) tried. The screen is erratic at best - maybe a 15% response rate.However, if you use a stylus or pen tip, it works fine. So it's basically something about defining the area that can be touched - I'd hope that a firmware upgrade fixes it, but don't hold out much hope.OK - So let's say you get the touchscreen thing sorted, and don't mind using a stylus. Well, it's still a disaster. See, this is held with the screen flipped out to the left (which may be an issue for lefties - hold it awkwardly in the right hand, or awkwardly in left, crossing over to hit touch screen right-handed -and even righties, as we're forced to use the touch the screen left-handed), fingers curling around the front, thumb up in back to hit controls. The problem is that almost any time I pick it up to use it, my index finger ends up blocking some of the lens, which is on the leading edge of what you hold, directly opposite the record and zoom buttons.What this means is that if you hold it in a comfy position to actually hit record or zoom, you're extremely likely to have a finger in your shot. And again, this happened with me, my wife, my kids - WITHOUT me telling them about the issue in advance - I just said: \"check this out - tell me what you think.\"So O.K. - maybe my thumb is too short. Maybe my entire family suffers from short thumbs, causing us to slide up too far, and thus blocking the lens. Well even the longest-thumbed among us is going to have a problem using the camera's light/flash, because it's directly under the lens and COMPLETELY blocked by everybody's index finger that I\"ve seen pick it up to use it. What were they thinking?Honestly, I wonder if anyone at Philips even looked at one of these before deciding to sell them. They need to either a) fire their industrial designers or (more likely) b) not buy crappy third party products they have no hand in designing. I really can't believe they're brought this thing to market.As for picture quality - my cell phone (an HTC, NOT an iPhone) is actually far better. Colors were washed out, and even pictures taken outdoors in daytime appeared blurred, despite not using the digital zoom on them. You can go 12 MP all day long, but if the pics aren't clear, who cares?Movies are a bit better, but not much. Even slow pans caused excessive blurring, and the the digital zoom is awful (that's not surprising - many digital zooms are), displaying no detail at even partial zoom.Perhaps in a pocket cam from a no-name company, sold in a cut-rate pharmacy toy department, aimed at kids and priced under 40 bucks, these issues would be excusable. From Philips, priced close to a double c-note, it's an insult to consumers and an indictment of the quality control at a once proud firm. With so many alternatives that are far better, many of which cost 40% less, I can see absolutely no reason to purchase this.A depressing, embarrassing disaster.

However, there are times that I want more than I can get from my little Canon PowerShot -- especially when it comes to video (which I always say I'm going to get into, but never really do). My old FlipVideo 1.0 wasn't going to cut it anymore. So I was rather pleased with the Amazon Vine offer of the Philips CAM300WH.In practice, though... it's okay. Just okay.On the plus side:* It works trouble-free with my Mac. Pop out the USB plug, attach it to the Mac, and it does all the right stuff with iPhoto. (Apparently there's software on-board to support Windows, but I didn't want to start up my Windows laptop just to try it out.)* The battery hasn't run out yet. It recharges from the computer, which I suppose could be a problem if I took it on a long trip to Europe without my laptop.* The video quality seems very good, through I haven't done more than a few videos and they've all been short. (You don't want to see videos of my cats? I won't insist. But really they are _very_ cute... you sure? Okay.) The anti-shake seems to work very well for video; my 2-minute recording of my embroidery teacher demonstrating a technique looks... well, not *professionally* done but not as clunky as I expected.* I very much like the way it folds up, and how it turns on by unfolding the camera.The negatives:* Nonexistent documentation. You're left to figure it out. That can take a little while, since at first it seems as though everything is done via the touch-screen. In reality you take the picture by pushing a button (which also starts and ends video recording).* The touch-screen interface is a nice idea, but the screen is too small and the \"universal\" icons left me mystified. And if you're holding the camera with your right hand, you're left to mess around with the touch screen with your left... it all feels awkward. (I suspect it would be worse for someone who is left-handed.)* Despite the promise on the box that the camera deals with hand-shake, I found that several of my still pictures were far from crystal clear. In fact, on a recent vacation I took both the Canon and the Philips, and intentionally took the same picture with both cameras. In every case the Canon's picture was in better focus.* There's a tiny, easy-to-move switch to toggle between taking video and still photos. TOO easy-to-move. On several occasions I thought I was taking a still shot only to realize that I'd shot a movie that was a few-seconds long... and missed the photo I had in mind. This caused me to use unladylike language.* It doesn't come with the microSD card. If you order this, be sure to buy one of those, too. They aren't cheap.All in all: I'll use this for video (oh boy, baseball games are coming!) but it won't displace my Canon PowerShot for \"real\" photographs.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simple Easy Excellent Quality", "Author": "Stephen W.

This was something of an experiment.This Philips camera - video camera - camcorder is great.  It is simple to operate and easy to understand.  The build quality is excellent.  It is so small that it looks silly on a tripod.  I see that as a good thing.Most important of all: it makes great videos with good sound.  I totally love the special video modes.  Black & White and Sepia are great, but 70's home movie camera is awesome.  Now if I ever see a Sasquatch all I have to do is switch to 70's mode to make the video totally unbelievable.  It's like I never even had to join the modern video era.

In your pocket, it resembles an iPhone 4S whose photographic capacities it surpasses in certain areas. While the 4S also has 1080p video, it \"only\" delivers 8GB still shots. Unlike the 4S this little camera has an optical zoom (4X) and some neat features like \"prerecording\" for three seconds prior to actually shooting. I haven't quite figured out the latter feature, but the idea makes sense, why miss good shots because you have a slow trigger finger?Storage seems to centered around high capacity micro SD cards which can hold 9 hours of HD video with 32GB cards. Fortunately storage is cheap these days. Transfers and charging tales place with the built in USB connector.So what is the problem with this iPhone lookalike? Well that is the problem. It looks like an iPhone but only does two things-take pictures and take video. The touch screen is clunky and not as responsive as iOS devices. Since there is no WiFi connectivity, there is no geo-tagging, no automatic date and time corrections, and of course no wireless iCloud availability until you transfer your pictures to a Mac.If what you want is a powerful point and shoot, those limitations should lead you to this terrific camera. I suspect the next generation of this camera will be even more than just an iPhone lookalike. You might want to wait for it or maybe the iPhone 5. The competition won't stop soon.
