I have an HD video camera already so won't be using that feature much.  However, I received my package at night and took some indoor, night-time pictures.  The quality was great (using the automatic setting).  I even zoomed-in to take a close-up of something on the far wall and even that turned out crisp and clear which is amazing!  Some folks had mentioned graininess indoors, but not sure why I'm not having that issue at all.I've seen a few people who noted that the included rechargeable battery pack doesn't work.  I also thought this until I realized this morning that you have to remove the batteries from the charger (they come already in there) and take off this clear plastic strip that keeps the batteries from being in contact with the metal strip.  Then, when you plug it in, the red lights will come on to show it's charging.  Also- for people who spend a lot of time in different countries, it's great that this comes with the European adapter (very small and portable so you can put it on before traveling) and a car charger.I've seen other folks complain that the case doesn't fit the camera (???).  I am able to fit the camera comfortably, with strap, and put the accessories in the various zippered pockets with space to spare.  I can't imagine how people have had a problem.... except that MAYBE they didn't realize that the internal divider that comes in the case is simply VELCROED IN! Folks- just pull that divider out! I actually scooted it to the side, put the camera in and then put the (included) tripod just on the other side of the barrier so it wouldn't scratch up against the camera.  This divider is made to be adjusted to the shape and position you want! I suppose that if you left it in the middle of the case (as it comes), the camera wouldn't fit, but it's clearly a movable/removable part...One other complaint I've seen has to do with the flash.  First - yes, the camera has a flash.  There's a little button on the left to pop it up.  And  yes, you can force the flash even when the automatic settings don't think you need it! All you do is press the button so the flash pops up and the LCD screen will show you some flash options automatically (red-eye reduction, etc...).  Scroll through those options and the second one is 'force flash' which will fire the flash on all photos (until you close the flash again).Besides that, my only complaint so far with the camera is that the SD card slot is in the battery compartment.  It's a little annoying, but no big deal.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "skoogy99", "ReviewID": "RT8AHGR38V7W1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera primarily to use on an upcoming trip to Africa.

It came with plenty of accessories, and the camera took decent pictures. I didn't really get a lot of hands-on with this camera; but for the few minutes I spent with this on Christmas eve, it seemed to work well and take good pictures. I personally had a Fuji FInepix S1500 for several years that was a wonderful, little camera. The S4200 is definitely a step up but reminds me a lot of the S1500. I think my niece will appreciate the 24x optical zoom as she continues using this camera. The S4200 would be considered a \"bridge\" camera as it is lightweight and compact like a \"point and shoot\" camera yet it has the feel and advanced functions of a DSLR.Considering the price vs. features/build quality, I would definitely recommend the S4200 as a good choice for one who is interested in moving up a level from a \"point and shoot.\"", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera and stuff", "Author": "Berry Bitty City Market", "ReviewID": "R2IK3K33T9OSGL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am still learning the camera, so I'll just say even I have been able to take acceptable plus pictures.

Monahan", "ReviewID": "R1JJQR7K9PE3GJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fuji makes a fine bridge camera.  My first one (which I still have and use) is an S5000.  It is a 7 mp extrapolated to 10 mp.  It takes an excellent photo.  The main things that are great about it are missing on my other 2 FinePix cameras (an S4000 and the S4200).  As a consequence, I don't find the other 2 as user friendly.The things missing on the other 2 are:1.  a rocker switch on the rear of the camera for framing with the telephoto lens. (The newer cameras have a ring around the shutter button.  This necessitates removing the finger from the shutter button to frame the photo.)2.  a separate slot on the side of the camera to load/unload a card.  (The new cameras require opening the battery compartment to load/unload a card).3.  a focusable EVF.  (The new ones are fixed and are difficult to use as I wear glasses.)The S4200 is a fine camera in it's own right and at the right price.  (My S5000 was purchased in 2004 for over $450.00.  The S4300 was less than 1/2 that price)..  I've since discovered that the S8200 has 2 of 3 of these features.  Maybe next year!Incidentally, the S5000 is no longer available.  If you're in the market for a camera that has many of the features of a DSLR without the high cost, I recommend FinePix Cameras.  Another great thing about all of the FinePix cameras is they use 4 AA batteries rather than a proprietary battery.  Just carry a couple of spare packs of AAs with you and you're good to go for a LOT of pictures.  (The flash does use a bunch of battery, but outdoor or bright lights, you'll get a few hundred shots per 4 batteries.)Have fun!", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "This bundle was a great deal; but hurry!", "Author": "David P. Miller \"Mitch Miller\"", "ReviewID": "R3VCG5T7H6SLJS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded from a S5000 (which was great in it's day) and this latest version is the perfect \"next generation\" of the model. However, Fuji is getting away from the AA battery style and opting for battery packs, so they are phasing out the S4200 (4300,4400,4500) series units. Nothing wrong with the camera, just going with the market flow. Since I had a dozen rechargable batteries for the S500, this worked great for me. I haven't used the new camera much yet, but I can tell you if you're not ready to go DSLR just yet, you need to get in on this bundle from Beach Camera through Amazon as soon as possible, cause they're going fast.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera - Great Accessories - Great Service", "Author": "Craig A Smith", "ReviewID": "R3RLXUWIMADMOQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No issues whatsoever! Just don't expect a DSLR or something, for this price, get real! That said, awesome amateur camera for this price! My fiance loved her gift. She now has the nicest camera of anybody I know, and doesn't have to stress and guard it with her life as you would if you bought a 1000 dollar semi-pro camera. This is more than adequate for most amateur photographers. Insanely customizable. Easy to use if you don't mind reading the manual when necessary and taking the time to get to know it and tinker with it. That's the fun part if you ask me.
