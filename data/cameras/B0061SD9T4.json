{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Steal of a deal!", "Author": "SemiProPhotog", "ReviewID": "R1BP1M1LLIPJUU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Body alone worth the price, but when you tack on the \"throw in\" additional items, you can't really beat the deal. YES, some of the items tossed in the package aren't brand name/flawless for the long term, however they aren't worthless either. I was rather impressed with the package offering, so of course had a fair streak of skepticism on what would actually arrive in the mail. More than pleasantly surprised.First impression: legit company & great deal for the money. Camera is in fact brand new (although it does appear someone opened the actual box with the camera, however everything still wrapped & intact with everything from manual to cables to software untouched). The toss in items are not so shabby either, between the lenses (included two-neither stellar, but the 18-55 [58mm] is a solid starter if you don't have something better) and additional teleconverter & wide angle w/ macro conversion lens (two more not useless goodies for the 58mm). Haven't bothered with the included flash as I have a proper external speedlite that surely exceeds anything that could offer, but if I didn't have a decade + of slowly accrued lens & accessories (and could afford a camera of this caliber)I would love this starter package to play with.As far as functionality, ran some basic test shots in varying modes & lights, with great results. The included Canon battery needed charged, but popped in the Vivitar additional battery & good to go while the other charged up. Only complaint I have, I honestly can't fault the company for, and that would be the shipping issues I had. While I still received it in reasonably good time, the initial delivery date was almost over before I looked up the tracking & saw it was delayed (again, this is UPS, not Davis). After almost 3 more days, it finally arrived & upon inspection, the box took a beating (UPS=United Parcel Smashers) and was fairly weathered and crushed in on one side. The contents were packed with just enough padding to not be too disturbed & everything individually wrapped or boxed, so that helped.In the end, I am quite pleased with my order & would absolutely recommend this deal to anyone interested in purchasing the 7D!", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Package Deal", "Author": "Marianne Robinson", "ReviewID": "R2RQARC3JDTGSB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera with all the different lens, filters etc.  Sure would have been nice to get the operating instructions as there are so many features to figure out.

My only issue was that one of the lens had a default. Because it was a new item I had to send the lens on my cost to canon directly to be fixed. Which they did and sent it back to me within 2 weeks.

However, I did anticipate that everything would at least work. Over the last month, I have been practicing with the camera and learrning to use the lenses. Today, I opened the Zeikos 57-in-One Card Reader and attempted to transfer some pictures I had taken to my computer. I could not open more than a few files without the card reader crashing. If I had seen that mentioned in the reviews, I would not have purchased the package,  Without purchasing another card reader, I cannot, to my knowledge, transfer data from the camera to my computer.  A search of the individual item (the Zeikos 57-in-One USB 2.0 High Speed Card Reader) on Amazon.com reveals that it has a review rating of slightly more than 1 star out of 5.

Do your pricing on the body only however.  I bought better lenses, a bigger, better bag, tripod, filters, etc.  I actually laughed at the bag and tripod that came with this set.  The bag is flimsy and things can easily fall out of it.  The tripod is small, light, and breakable.  Might be nice for hiking, but seriously... just buy \"real\" accessories and shop around for price comparing this set as if it were body only unless you're a beginner and will only use the kit lenses.  The Canon 7D is one fine camera!  I would highly recommend it to anyone other than pros who need full frame.", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "AWESOME DEAL--SUPER FAST DELIVERY!  LOVE this camera!", "Author": "Rebecca Boothe", "ReviewID": "RFJ098TXEVCLK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "FIRST OFF:  I am VERY HAPPY. Very, VERY SUPER HAPPY with my purchase.  Best deal I could find.  I highly recommend this seller and the product.  Great price, super fast shipping, new amazing camera and software with lots of new extras.  A beginners dream!SHIPPING:I was shocked at how fast I got my package.  Ordered on a Tuesday, expected it the next Monday-Thursday...GOT IT SATURDAY!  Two business days before the expected 1st possible day of delivery and it went from NY to UT.  I had free delivery so that was extremely impressive!!PERFORMANCE:  As far as I can tell, Amazing, wonderful, GREAT!I am a novice photographer so to get a new DSLR of this quality and at this price with all the additional pieces was fantastic!  As I am a beginner everything looks amazing to me so I cannot give a review as to the nit picky details professionals might notice as to the performance of the camera itself.  The camera gets pretty decent reviews everywhere I've looked.  Most of the negatives I've read probably won't be noticed unless you really know your stuff.  I'm sure most of those things can be overlooked if you don't have 5K+ to plunk down on a professional DSLR.  We have a director friend who also happens to teach film at a big University here who says it is a really nice camera for it's range.PACKAGING AND EXTRAS: Just fine.  All new.I did an amazon search for all the additional pieces and came up with slightly over $500 worth of extras.  I can't say for the quality of all items, but that is still a pretty good deal seeing as though the camera itself is worth over $1400.  Great to build from if you are a beginner like me.SOFTWARE:I successfully registered my camera with Canon (you have to go to their site) and uploaded the software and updates from online to my computer.MY ONLY COMPLAINT: The tripod is a little bit wobbly-especially when fully extended but I guess any photographer will tell you to invest in a good one and not to scrimp there.LAST THING:THE camera bag works fine to carry almost everything necessary.  It would be nice to have a bag with extra/separate compartments and a zipper top but hey, if you don't already have one...this one will do just fine.", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "great Canon 7d package with everything you need", "Author": "zuhal turnacigil", "ReviewID": "R305BTE2C5ONHA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the price for Canon 7D package is very very reasonable.Every other things you receive with the package are going to help you especially when you are working professionally.Canon 7D  is a great camera with lots of new advancement.The shipping process was just 2 days and everything was wrapped carefully.My friend also bought the same package and we are really happy that we were able to found this deal because as you all know Canon 7D (body only)is already expensive.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Somewhat", "Author": "Danny", "ReviewID": "R2B14MUVNMHDZF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It was ok.
