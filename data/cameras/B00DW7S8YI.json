{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good choice!", "Author": "Kimberly R. Norton", "ReviewID": "R3PO9TAOA0EAMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you like the Canon Rebels AND you want a small camera then the SL1 with 18-135mm lens is a good choice.  I had this camera with 18-55 and 55-250 lenses which equal useless.  The whole idea of haveing a small portable dslr camera is to not worry about extra baggage yet have the option of using extra stuff.  With this particular lens it will do about 90% of all shots you want to take (unless you are interested in long range shots).This camera is also available in 18-55mm lens only. If you only take wide angle shots then that one will work but I would not recommend it. I guess if weight is a concern then 18-55 will work but your portrait photos will have people looking like a Poodle with a big nose and small ears.  Larger focal lenghts 85 - 135mm give better images on portraits, in my opinion.Picture Quality?I have a Nikon d5200 and d7100 and the photo quality looks different from the Canon.  I prefer the Nikon quality but there is nothing wrong with the Canon quality - it's a personal preference. If you take pictures with the SL1 then you will probably like them. You only run into problems when you shoot a different camera, like Nikon d5200 or d7100, then try to compare the images.  The d5200 is much larger than the Canon SL1 and the d7100 is larger than the d5200. The Canon 70D is pretty big too. So if size is a concern the the SL1 is your best choice.Again, if you like the quality of Canon images, especially the Rebels, then you will like this camera.  Just make sure to purchase it with the 18-135 lens.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DW7S8YI"}}
