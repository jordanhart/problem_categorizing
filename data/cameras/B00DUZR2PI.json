What can I say they did a good job. The kit came as described and nothing missing.It also was shipped and received incredibly fast. My only complaint is a minor one. Some of the accessories that where included are on the cheap side. But they all work good and for how much the whole thing cost, Its a great deal. I would defiantly buy another one from them for my self any time.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overall  98% satisfied", "Author": "Q. Stevenson", "ReviewID": "R31JHFSXV15SEX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I REALLY want to give this 5 Stars. This is an amazing bundle at an amazing price point. The shipping was incredibly FAST which is a quality much sought after when making purchaces from online vendors. When you purchace at a physical store-front, you have your product in hand at the time of purchace. When you purchace online, there is a time gap betwen the time you  make the purchace and the shipping time it takes for you to receive your item. So the faster the online seller ships, the faster you get your item. Superfinds did Excellent here and shipped the same day I purchaced. Everything was boxed and packageed professionally and presentably. There was even a hand written note, adding a personal touch to my purchace with Superfinds. This I really liked, because it showed me that the business cared enough about MY order to take the time to hand write me a note regarding my purchace with them.As mentioned in the  beginning of this review, I said that I really wanted to give this 5 Stars. The ONLY reason I am not giving it 5 is because the SD card I received with the bundle was not comparable to the SD card depicted in the image advertised.  The card I recieved was a Class 4 card. The card advertized in their bundle picture is a Class 10 card. It's not a big deal if you are shooting stills. However, you can run it to issues when trying to shoot HD Videos with a class 4 card. And, a big focal point of me getting this camera was to shoot HD video. I saw that this package/bundle had the Class 10 card included with the camera I wanted PLUS all the accessories so i jumped on it. Other than that THIS is an AMAZING Bundle for the Canon T3I at a Great Price. Buy fom Superfinds. Hopefully they'll see this review and work with me on the SD card issue.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice kit and good-valued", "Author": "Yan Ni Kong", "ReviewID": "R39LC18PGMYAHZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This kit is a very nice one, especially for the beginners.The price is also the best I could find online.The customer service I got from Linda is very nice as well.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera, great price", "Author": "Judy Hall Jacobson", "ReviewID": "R1PPS0LSQP5TYZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first digital SLR I have owned.
