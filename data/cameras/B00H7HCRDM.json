I bought this for my son for Christmas and the experience could not have been more disappointing. From the start the desktop app that we needed to download to install the firmware update for this camera failed to load properly on our mac. We tried many different times to download that on several different computers and it either failed to download or failed to launch. In short, we never got it to work and our attempts at contacting Looxcie customer service/support failed as well. The new desktop app ruined my ability to sync with my LX2 as well. We had very high hopes for this camera based on the LX2 but we are currently trying to return this camera. It came to us through an Amazon reseller - even though it was a PRIME purchase - and hope there won't be problems with the return but apparently this is not as simple as orders that are fulfilled by Amazon - whom we have NEVER had any issues with whatsoever. Just a disappointing Christmas purchase all around and I suspect it boils down to an incompatibility with Mac operating systems.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loxxcie", "Author": "George Barrera", "ReviewID": "RQGR6R6HUSC7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Looxcie is great and can be used to record in small spaces or different than normal angles.
