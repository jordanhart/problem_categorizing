{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An Amazing Camera!!", "Author": "OrangeCrush \"Still shooting with Film!\"", "ReviewID": "R1SOBPIM4GOBRR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually still shoot film the vast majority of the time however I purchased my mother a G-10 for her birthday last year and spent a couple weeks using the camera so I could adequately teach her how to use it. I have since borrowed it on numerous occasions and was actually about to buy my own G-10 but then I heard about the G-11 so I figured I would wait and buy the new upgraded version. I am glad I did just that. For me this camera is worth upgrading to just for the swivel LCD view screen on the back. I cant tell you how many times I have shot outdoors and was completely unable to see the LCD screen even when you shaded it with one of your hands. Adding the swivel option basically eliminates this problem. This option is so nice when shooting outdoors that I am honestly thinking about upgrading my mothers camera for this one reason alone as she doesn't have the best eyesight which means if I am having problems seeing the viewfinder, I can only imagine how hard it is for her to see it.The next best thing I have noticed about this camera is its improved film speed ratings. I have already done a lot of testing with the G-11 and to say that they have improved the speed ratings is a huge understatement especially in the higher film speed settings. I was extremely hesitant to use a film speed over 400 with the G-10 yet I am using speeds above 800 with the G-11. Depending on the conditions your shooting in you should see anywhere from a 1.0 to 2.0 stop difference. I did some tests where the G-11 shot pictures at 800 that were basically equivalent to a 200 on the G-10. I was hoping for an improvement in this area but wasn't expecting this big of an improvement.The next biggest improvement has to be with the auto mode. I tested the auto mode extensively with the G-10 as that was going to be the mode my mother used the most, at least out of the gate, and I was unimpressed. There were too many shooting situations to count that easily fooled the camera into shooting with settings that were less than optimal. You would still get decent results but it definitely needed improvement and they have done just that. Running the identical tests I did with the G-10 clearly showed that this camera is much better at selecting the appropriate shooting mode. Some conditions were drastic improvements. This is probably the 2nd biggest reason why I am most likely going to be upgrading my mothers camera to a G-11.A lot of people were concerned with the G-11 as it actually has a smaller picture size than the G-10. The G-10 has a 14.7 MP size and the G-11 only has a 10 MP size. Overall that's a 32% decrease in maximum size. People who have a high understanding of digital imaging sensors knew not to worry as the MP size is not the most important aspect to an imaging chip. Details such as dynamic range, image noise and low-light performance are just as important, if not more important, when discussing overall image quality. I for one have always hated the MP war as we passed the quality that the vast majority of the population would be content with a long time ago. It has basically become a numbers game where people think that bigger is better and they just don't seem to grasp that they will never have any use for such high MP images. So I tip my hat to Canon for taking this extremely bold step as this is the FIRST time that we have seen resolution reduced in a line of cameras that is still progressing forward. IMO this is the white flag that signifies the war of the MP is finally coming to an end and we will finally see companies focused on these other, equally important, image qualities as much as they have been with the MP size. As for the image quality of the new sensor, its outstanding! I immediately noticed a difference in the overall quality of the images. They seem richer with much less compression on the higher and lower ends. If I had the choice of choosing between the G-10 sensor and the G-11 sensor I would take the G-11 sensor every single time. Again a big tip of the hat to Canon for boldly choosing to go this route with the G-11 sensor.The G-11 retains the same 5x optical zoom lens from the G-10 which in case your unaware is equivalent to a 28mm to 140mm lens. Also the same is the aperture settings which go from f/2.8 to f/4.5 depending on the zoom setting. Shutter speeds range from 1/4,000 to 15 seconds and it has the same metering modes as the G-10 (evaluative, center-weighted and spot). Thankfully they didn't make any changes to the manual dials at the top of the camera as that is easily one of my favorite aspects to these cameras. ISO speed and the camera mode dials let you quickly and easily switch the most important settings. I an an old school photographer so I still prefer dials to buttons. IMO its the best set up out of all the point and shoots on the market.2 other noticeable improvements include an increased flash sync speed of 1/2000 and a high-definition HDMI connector (Dont worry it still has the USB 2.0 connection).The bottom line is that Canon has taken the G-10, which was easily one of the best point and shoots on the market, and made some outstanding improvements that have taken this camera line to a whole new level. If your one of those people who care more about how many MPs your camera has than the actual image quality of the camera then you should stick with the G-10. If however you are more concerned with image quality than MP's then drop what your doing, list your G-10 on eBay and run out and buy the G-11. The image quality, improved noise performance, and swivel back LCD screen make this camera absolutely worth every penny.The only negative thing I can say about this camera is in regards to Canon's sheer ignorance when it comes to the lack of standard size filter threads. How hard would it be to design this camera so it had a 52 or 58mm threaded lens opening? Trust me when I tell you it would be extremely easy. At the very least they could design it so all you needed was a simple step up ring to 52mm or 58mm. Instead they leave out threads altogether and make you go out and spend around a hundred bucks on a 3rd party aluminum lens tube that then allows you to use 58mm and 72mm filters. The \"Plastic\" Canon Lens tube isn't even an option as its so poorly designed. It just really annoys me that canon totally ignores this aspect of this camera. In all honesty threaded lens openings should be mandatory for all cameras, even point and shoots. Again it would be EXTREMELY Easy to change.Overall the G-11 is simply an amazing, must buy, camera.5 Stars!!Edit......The more I thought about it the more I thought I should come on here and be more specific in regards to the lens tube issue. While Amazon will not allow me to write the name of the company that makes the aluminum lens tube that people should buy if they want to use filters with the G-10 or G-11, I can however be specific in regards to which one you absolutely should not buy which ironically is the one made by Canon. The lens tube that you should stay away from is the LA-DC58K Lens Adapter and here is a link to that item.Canon LA-DC58K Conversion Lens Adapter for Canon G10 Digital CamerasThere are multiple problems with the LA-DC58K. First its plastic which means the overall quality is much lower than the other options on the market, besides plastic threads are never a good idea as they wear down with time making it harder and harder to properly screw things in as it ages. This simply doesn't happen with brass or aluminum threads. The biggest problem with the LA-DC58K is that it doesn't fit soundly on the camera. Once installed it should be 100 movement free, in other words it should have a nice sound fit and that just isn't what you get with the LA-DC58K. It rattles around and is completely unstable once fitted in the camera and this is simply inexcusable. As if this wasn't enough you also get severe vignetting at wide angles and the tube isn't long enough thus it restricts full zoom ability. I honestly have absolutely no clue how this accessory was allowed to go to market in its current condition.I know it may seem unbelievable that Canon could design an accessory for one of its flagship models that has this many problems but believe it as everything I wrote is 100% accurate. I am one of the unfortunate people that ordered the LA-DC58K. It was absolutely horrid and was boxed up and returned after less than an hour of use. Its a shame that I cant give the name of the company that makes the aluminum version but since its not sold on Amazon its against their policy to list it. Just Google \"Aluminum lens tube canon G10\" and you should easily find the company that produces it.I hope this helps!", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very pleased with the Canon G11!", "Author": "C. J. Boyle", "ReviewID": "R1QQ8ZCMM3NK21", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this camera and wanted to post my impressions of the camera from the perspective of an average camera user. I bought the G11 for my husband, who wanted an easy-to-use camera with an optical viewfinder and a swing-out LCD that was viewable in bright light. He is an avid hiker, cross-country skier, & mountain-biker who just wants to get a good shot when he pulls out his camera.  On the other hand, I'm a more advanced (not pro) camera user with an SLR setup and I'm comfortable with manual controls. Both of us take photos for our own enjoyment and to share with friends and family.We both love this camera! The wide angle is wide enough for vacation and scenery shots.  It takes very good people pictures and we like the face-detection feature, but turned off the anti-blink mode (maybe I DO want a picture of my granddaughter with her eyes closed!).  The close-up/macro photos are incredibly sharp and have impressive depth-of field. My husband likes the brief on-screen tips when he changes settings (and will likely turn them off once he's more familiar with them).  When I use the camera, I find it very easy to change settings, although I sometimes find I've inadvertently pressed the metering mode button when I pick up the camera.Power-on is very fast and shutter action is quick as well. The colors are very good - I have no complaints at all in that regard. I've taken both jpeg and RAW photos; the jpeg's look really fine to me, and I think I'd use RAW only when taking pictures I'd want to play with, such as landscapes, sunsets, close-up portraits, things like that.We found that in auto mode, the camera takes slightly over-exposed outdoor pictures in bright light. That is easy to adjust using the exposure compensation button in one of the non-auto modes. Or by just turning a few more degrees away from the sun - that works well, too! I like that there's some resistance in the adjustment buttons on the top of the camera, making it hard to change something by accident - a common problem I've encountered with other P&S; cameras.  I also like the adjustment wheel in the back; I find it easy to use and like that I can use it to move quickly thru the various options.Both of us are comfortable with the handling/heft of the camera. It feels solid and well-built. Neither of us likes the neck strap so we bought the a wrist strap to use instead. It would have been a nice \"option\" for Canon to design and include a wrist strap with the camera - it seems counter-intuitive IMO to have a smallish camera need a neck strap!I hope this brief review helps some people who are looking for another perspective on the G11. It's not meant to be a comprehensive review - just the personal impressions of two \"average\" camera users with a couple of different expectations.", "Date": "October 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "A nearly perfect blend of features.", "Author": "Kirk Tuck \"Kirk Tuck\"", "ReviewID": "R10YKYX2G1K81F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only owned a G11 since this morning but was compelled to write this review for two reasons.  First,  I am amazed at how well Canon listened to their customer base.  People loved the G10 ( and I plan on keeping the one I've been shooting for the last year....) But the two biggest complaints/suggestions I've routinely heard are:  1.  The high ISO noise is too obvious and noise filters blur the image.  2.  I wish it had a flexible screen on the back.  To those two complaints I would have added:  It would be nice to have a better optical view finder with more accurate framing.We all hoped that they wouldn't change the things that everyone liked such as the wonderful analog controls on the top of the G10.So,  I now have camera that IS really about a stop and a half or two stops more sensitive.  400 on the G11 looks better than 200 on the G10.  I'd buy the camera just for that.  Secondly, the screen on the back now swivels.  Nope, the viewfinder didn't get improved.What you are getting is a really nicely made camera that is convenient to carry around (but not really pocketable)  that works quickly and well and is getting into the quality space that used to be the sole provence of DSLR cameras.  You also get a nice movie mode (640, not HD) which works well for web projects as well as a camera with smaller file sizes than it's predecessor.  It is 10 megs versus 15.  Another reviewer griped that the G11 should have had a longer zoom and 24 megapixels.  I don't want either of those things because I understand the greater the range of the zoom lens the less well it can be corrected for optical faults.  I don't want more megapixels because 99% of what I print is 12 by 18 inches or smaller and both cameras will already do that very well if you practice good technique.  There are  plenty of long zoom range cameras that work well for snapping your kids playing soccer.  I have a Canon SX20 that does a good job with that.  But there are few small cameras that are both fun to shoot quickly, on the street and it available light situations that also yield really nice files.  This camera is one of them.  We should give a few kudos to Canon for getting rev2 (actually rev 8) right for what we really like to do as photographic artists.I hope someone writes a really good book about using cameras in this class.Also thrilled that Canon uses the same battery between the G10 and the G11.Added last night:  I went out shooting in the soft rain and gloomy half light yesterday afternoon/evening.  I used the camera at ISO 400 and 800 and shot as low as 1/25th of a second.  The images did not have a lot of noise and the IS worked very well.  If you've shot with Canon's previous powershot cameras you will get used to the controls and menus very quickly.", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon G11 vs. Canon S90: A Matter of Personal Preference", "Author": "G. Gilbert \"G. Gilbert\"", "ReviewID": "R3EM6GGC6GRIUK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon G11 vs. Canon S90: A Matter of Personal Preference (I'm posting a very similar review under both the S90 and the G11.)I've been trying to find a 'carry everywhere' camera to always keep on my person so that I don't miss the amazing things that make up the events of everyday life (like tomorrow when I actually get to get off the R train at Cortland Street in Manhattan, something I haven't been able to do for years due to construction).  I wanted something that was (1) Small and (2) Had the ability for full manual controls for shutter speed and aperture.  The two cameras that fit this bill very well were Canon's S90 and G11 - Canon's top of the line point and shoots in their respective series (S and G).  But which one?The two major things that the cameras have in common (in addition to the above mentioned manual controls) are:1. The same image sensor (same size, etc)2. The same image processorAnyone who's written a comparison of the cameras will point this out quickly - because normally 'which camera' would come down to these one of these two issues.  In addition to these things, there are dozens of other features that both cameras share: this makes it very difficult to decide \"which camera?\"  Having owned both of them (but ultimately deciding to go with the G11 and returning the S90) I would like to make a short list of positive/negatives which I think could be deciding factors when trying to choose between these two excellent cameras.  Instead of listing both positive and negative points by each camera, I'll simply point out the positives of each that the other model does not share - I hope that this is helpful in your decision!G11: Advantages- Hot shoe: but on a compact?  Some people will say \"it's pointless to use an external flash on a compact camera - the whole point is to be compact!\"  That's a valid critique, but at the same time there are times when it's nice to be able to throw a flash on a compact if you really need one.  I own the 430EX and the 580EX II (both compatible) but I picked up the newish 270EX with the G11 and it works fantastically with the camera without adding a lot of weight.  Both the camera and the flash fit perfectly into the Pelican 1060 case side by side but with enough room to stay padded with the foam insert.  And hey - if I want to throw the nearly-twice-as-big-as-the-camera-itself 580EX II on the G11 I can do it!  Yet I can also do without it - the camera is versatile this way in a way that the S90 is not.- Vari-Angle LCD: which at first I found annoying.  The screen adds just enough bulk to the camera that it does not fit in smaller cases which it otherwise would.  When I first got the camera I was really rather annoyed by it in fact - not only because of the bulk but because it is actually smaller than the LCD on the S90.  I had to read another review to realize that it was a much better thing than I realized - because it allows you to hold the camera at all sorts of different levels and angles while still allowing you to see what you're shooting.  I really enjoy doing photography with the camera low to the ground (I have an angled viewfinder for my DSLR) and so this works perfectly for what I need.  As others have pointed out, the Vari-Angledness of the LCD allows you to flip it while in storage so that it's even more protected.- Remote Shutter Release: you can use one!  I love doing night photography and that the G11 allows me to use a cable release really seals the deal on the S90 vs. G11 for me personally (granted on the S90 you can always use the 2 second self-timer).  Good news too if you use a Canon Rebel DSLR - it's the same cable release.S90: Advantages- Very compact: quite a bit smaller than the G11, it would easily fit in pockets and cases that the G11 never could.  If you're into Pelican cases like I am, you can fit the S90 in the Pelican Micro Case 1010 with room to spare.- More efficient controls: the ring around the lens is amazing and an excellent idea.  Especially when in manual mode, this makes setting aperture and shutter speed a snap (it's more awkward on the G11 - you have to use the small back dial and then toggle between aperture and shutter speed with a separate button which can get to be messy when you're trying to shoot quickly).- The f2.0 lens: a full stop faster than the G11's 2.8 lens.  This is a LOT of light, and especially important when you want to take photos in low-light situations (note though that the lens on the S90 doesn't zoom in far as the G11 if that's important to you - both lenses are the same focal length when zoomed out).Both the G11 and the S90 are beautiful, well made cameras that will serve any photographer well when you're looking for something that's not DSLR sized.", "Date": "November 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Everything I Wanted", "Author": "Andrew Cooper \"Andrew Cooper\"", "ReviewID": "R1S9QADWRQSK5L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A few days hands-on with a new camera have allowed me to form some opinions. Overall I am very impressed, the camera looks to be everything I wanted. Build quality appears to be up to the G-series standard. The wider lens gained with the G10 and carried over to the G11 is distinct improvement. Photo quality meets my high expectations, what else do you want to know?I am not writing this entry as a complete review, the digital photography websites will do a far more thorough job of that. But I do have some comments on the camera I wanted to put here. Much of my comparison is against the Powershot G9, as I never have never seriously used the G10.After using the Canon G9 for so long I have had no issue in learning the controls of the G11, most are located in the same places, the menus are mostly unchanged. This was true from the very first frame when I was using the camera in the dark. The only real difference is in the top wheels, where exposure compensation is now a direct control and not a rear thumbwheel action. Considering how often I use this function the top wheel is a very welcome improvement. ISO gain is below the main function wheel, something that has the benefit of being harder to actuate. I had a few instances on the G9 of finding I was using a high ISO when I wanted low ISO as this wheel had gotten accidentally changed.The camera is a bit larger than the G9, most of that seems to be front to back. The data sheet shows the camera to be 5mm (1/4\") thicker than my G9, you feel that 5mm when gripping the camera. It takes a larger pocket to hold the G11. The camera just fit in the shirt pocket of the aloha shirt I was wearing when unpacking the camera, but barely, not certain I would call this a pocket camera.The return of the flip-out viewscreen is welcome, but with mixed feelings. The loss of 0.2\" in screen size from the G9 is not an issue, despite some negative comments I have read on other sites. I enjoy the ability to compose a photo with the camera held over my head or close to the ground. This is something I loved about my old Nikon 995 and allows some great creative possibilities. I worry a bit about the robustness of the screen assembly, will I inadvertently damage the screen or the swivel mechanism?I do forget that the screen can be swung out. At least twice already I have found myself in an uncomfortable position trying to compose a frame before realizing I can just flip out the screen and stop straining my neck. Duh!The screen is just beautiful, nice color, bright and with very high resolution. Some difficulty seeing the screen in full sunlight unless you turn up the brightness all the way, annoying to do when the setting is buried in a menu. The screen also shows every little greasy fingerprint, it is nearly impossible to avoid putting a finger on the screen during handling.One price of the larger area taken up by the flip-out viewscreen is a smaller area for the rear panel controls. They are certainly more compact than the G9, I have had some issues with my fat thumb when using the wheel and rocker. I suspect these will go away as I become more practiced with the camera.I have now taken a fair number of photographs under a wide range of conditions.  The low light performance is a dramatic improvement over the Canon G9. I had done specific testing with the G9 after I ran up against the G9 performance limitations in low light during normal use of the camera.To see what the G11 could do I set it up with a tripod to take photos under the light of the full Moon.  To my surprise the camera did a respectable job of landscape photos lit only by moonlight.  This is something I have done with a DSLR on several occasions, but did not expect to do with a compact.  At ISO1600 and 3200 there is appreciable noise in the photos, but these speeds are by no means useless.  The in-camera dark frame subtraction also works well, with no hot pixels apparent in close examination of the frames.Another pleasant surprise was the quality of the new lens. From the first images the lens has continually impressed me as better than the G9 lens for sharpness. I was surprised when closely examining the day's images, fine details in a seed head were perfectly sharp to the limit of the sensor resolution. The limiting resolution of the camera was indeed set by the sensor, not the lens, at least under the right conditions. Is this simply the lower resolution sensor? Is this a result of not pressing the performance past the resolving power of the lens? Or is the new lens design simply better than the G9?My only major complaint is one that many others have leveled against Canon...  Why does this camera not have a decent video mode?  I usually shoot still, but like to do a little video when the situation calls for it.  The 1024x768 video and time lapse video modes of the G9 are missing.  Why can they not add at least a 720p HD mode?  There is likely no technical reason for this.  Some internal Canon politics with the video camera division?The camera is indeed everything it has promised to be, with very few shortcomings. Beautiful pictures from a compact camera. I look forward to a long and productive relationship with this camera.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Why I bought the Canon G11 instead of the S90", "Author": "Traveler", "ReviewID": "R1ZKH0SL4RIPS7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're already in the market for a top level P&S; that shoots RAW then you're probably looking at the Canon G11, Canon S90 or the Panasonic LX3.  All three cameras have their plusses and minuses so no one should be saying which one is best.  The question is what works for you.  That's all that matters.The Canon G11 and S90 both share the same sensor which means they have almost identical noise performance.  The big difference on the low light issue is that the S90 starts at f/2 and the G11 at f/2.8.  Sounds like a small difference, but it isn't when you need all the low light capability you can get.According to at least one blowhard pro reviewer (Ken Rockwell - don't know how the man passes as an \"expert\"), you'd think that the G11 was a waste of money in comparison to the S90 and that only people who want a heavier camera for no apparent reason would want the G11.Here are my reasons:1. The G11 has an articulating screen.  There are multiple uses for this.  A)Makes self portraits easy; B)Allows you to inconspicuously take photos with the camera down at your waist; C)Allows you to compose photos at ground level without lying down; D)Allows you to take photos with the camera over your head in crowd situations; and E)Allows you to protect the screen by turning it inward towards the camera.  I know the articulating LCD has its detractors, but to me it's one of the top reasons I bought it over the S90.2.  The longer focal length: 140 vs. 105 on the S903.  The heavier weight.  Heavier means metal.  Metal means this camera can take more abuse.  Pros in the field frequently choose the G series Canons as their backup because they're built so well.  If you're not going to take your camera on a mountain expedition, for example, then you might not need the G11's sturdier build and the S90 might be a better choice.4.  The easy to use \"as if it was designed by a real photographer\" outside dials for mode, ISO, and bracketing.But the G11 also has its issues.The f/2.8 lens IS a concern, although the cameras do even out around 50mm and the G11 surpasses the S90 at the other end of the zoom.  There are times I really don't want to carry that extra weight.  And the G11 has bit too many extras on it that make it more complicated than it needs to be.  Quite honestly, I hate how Canon designs their interface.  I'm a Nikon DSLR user, but their P&S; cameras don't match the Canon's in terms of quality.  I love what the G11 can do, but I despise trying to change settings on it.There's one reason why none of these things pushed me towards buying the easier to use S90:  I also bought the Panasonic LX3.  The LX3 has an f/2 lens and an ultra-wide 24mm lens.  It's older technology than both the Canons, but whoa does it fill in the gaps on the G11.  It's lightweight, easier to use, wider lens (even if it has limited zoom), and has a specific feature not on any Canon: dynamic B&W.;  I know, I can get the same effect with software after shooting.  But that's not my style. I generally shoot it just the way I want it in the moment.  I don't enjoy spending a half hour at the computer trying to tweak an image to death.  I was self taught on a 35mm shooting almost exclusively B&W; so Panasonic's bow to us long term photographers is greatly appreciated.I realize most folks can't afford to get two top of the line P&S; cameras.  You have to decide what features count the most.  I'm betting most users will prefer the S90.  They won't use the articulating screen and they don't need the sturdier build.  For people who want to just take photos of friends and family I actually recommend the S90.  But if you have needs that go beyond that, start giving the G11 a serious look.  There's just one fly in the ointment I have to add: The S90 has the slowest continuous shooting speed of all three of these cameras at .9 fps vs. the G11's 1.1 and the LX3's 2.5.  If you're shooting fast moving children, for example, you might want to back up completely and reexamine what it is you need as a cheaper camera without RAW but with faster continuous shooting might be the better choice.I'm writing this review in late 2009.  I've read that Panasonic will probably release the LX3 replacement, said to be the LX5, in 2010.  If they keep the positives and add a longer zoom and an articulating screen then forget everything I wrote as I will be ditching both my LX3 and G11.  I hate the Canon interface that much.One last thing on weight - bought a camera grip that just makes the camera feel perfect in my hand and I'm no longer afraid I'm going to drop it.

Nothing, other than its noise levels at higher ISO settings. Is this a serious problem? Well, if like me, you want a camera that's a portable alternative to your DSLR and which operates very close to your DSLR's performance, then it probably is. How much so? Here's two examples that made me invest in the G11. The first was when using the G10 on a bright blue-sky day to shoot sports events on its \"Sports\" program - the camera, correctly, chose shutter speeds of 1/1250 and as a result set ISO ratings at around 400, but noise was evident at 50% magnification and very marked at 100% magnification. The second was when snap-shotting my children indoors in reasonably good late afternoon light with the flash turned off - on the \"Auto\" program the ISO was, again correctly, bumped up to over 200 and, again, noise was evident at 100% magnification, so much so that I was forced to manually set ISO to under 200 with the resulting problems of moving subjects and slower shutter speeds.You could say that I'm being overly \"picky\" here, but I don't think so... while these noise levels are acceptable in cheaper and much smaller point & shoot cameras, they're not acceptable in one that's priced at DSLR levels. More importantly, they mean that it can't be used with confidence as a portable point & shoot alternative to my DSLR, which was one of the main reasons for buying it. Sure you can overcome some of the ISO issues by using the camera's huge number of manual over-ride options, but you shouldn't have to.The reason for this is, of course, the mega-pixel count in the G10 which while good for marketing purposes is just too high for the chip size in a camera this small and which therefore precipitates additional noise at even relatively modest ISO levels. Set the camera to under ISO 200 and you get the resolution advantage of 14.7 million mega-pixels but your shooting options are reduced; let the camera do the work and, in anything other than \"normal\" situations, noise could become a serious issue.Time to assess how my newly acquired G11 performs in similar situations... the answer?... perfectly. My test shot comparisons between the two cameras show noticeably reduced noise levels for the G11 at anything over ISO 200 with, as noted by other reviewers, something between a one & two stop improvement. What this \"one to two stop improvement\" means in practice is that in the critical band between ISO 200 & 800 (critical because ISOs in this range are typically selected by both cameras' pre-set programs in poor daylight or in normal daylight with high shutter speeds) noise is not a serious issue with the G11 - it also means that the G11's noise levels across the board are as close to my DSLR as I'd hope for or expect. In terms of resolution, there is indeed a slight loss in the G11's performance with slow ISO rated shots (i.e. 80 or 100) that's noticeable if they're blown up to very high magnification levels... but, am I really going to use this type of camera rather than my DSLR for huge prints or professional quality studio or field work? Unlikely. Also, there seems to be a marginally better \"feel\" to the G11's shots at below ISO 200 which could be the result of claimed improvements in its image processing or just my perception. Whatever, the bottom line is that the G11 produces the same or better quality photos than the G10 in virtually all \"real life\" situations that I'm likely to use it for.Other differences? Well, the G11's rotating screen gets a lot of praise but, in my view, can be argued either way: it has obvious benefits but it makes the G11 feel a little \"bulkier\" and, to fit it in, it's necessitated two unfortunate changes to its rear panel layout - a reduction in the size of the rotating wheel surrounding the rear function button, making it much less tactile, and a 10% reduction in the size of its viewing screen. In all other respects the camera's are pretty much identical: the G11 has a couple more menu options which most people will never use; it has two additional pre-sets on its main dial - a \"Low Light\" program, which is of limited value, and a \"Quick Shot\" program that's pretty much the same as the \"P\" program but which replaces the image on the screen with an easy to read summary of all the camera's settings; the \"Panorama\" pre-set on the G10's main dial is included as one of the \"Scene\" options in the G11; and, the on/off button on the G11 is slightly smaller. In other words, other than the advantages/disadvantages of a rotating screen, nothing worth writing home about.Oh, and the price... the G11 is, at present, about \u00a3100 more than the G10 in the UK, which is a pretty big difference. Is a \u00a3100 price hike worth it for improved performance in certain situations and a rotating screen? Well, that's your decision: the G10 is a perfectly acceptable and usable camera once you know its ISO limitations but, if you don't want these limitations or, if you want the confidence that the camera will perform at close to DSLR levels in virtually all situations you throw at it, then the G11 is definitely worth the extra money.

Also I afforded very nice lenses, my flagship being a great, versatile 18-200 mm Nikon zoom. With this type of equipment I certainly got spoilt, especially where speed, responsiveness and picture quality are concerned.The main reason for me to buy the G11 was to own a portable camera which would offer a similar quality and scope for creativity as a SLR. I aimed for the G11 because of the sturdy built, the reasonable resolution, the good reviews on performance in poor light conditions, and the articulate screen (which is extremely practical, I would really like to see one on more SLRs).I have not been disappointed in some respects: the picture quality is imressive (though not quite what you get with a D200 type piece), the handling very comfortable, poor light performance very satisfactory and it is easy enough to just slip into a pocket or backpack and have ready when needed. I am also very pleased with the battery life, I think I must have taken well over 500 pictures with the LCD screen on, and viewed a lot, before having to charge the battery the first time. I bought a spare battery and thus equipped I believe you are good for a week of intense photography out in the boons without running out of power.The main negative issue I observed so far is the speed of the camera, or the lack thereof: From turning on to being ready to focus on something it's reasonably quick (I estimate about 0.5 sec). The time to focus is a little too long for my liking and sometimes the AF has trouble \"deciding\" what to focus on. There is virtually no shutter lag, fortunately, but then it takes an awfully long time (1-2 sec)for the camera to save the image and be ready for the next shot (but maybe that's also got to do with the SD card...).This really is the main critical issue. The second is the really pathetic optical viewfinder, but I had been alerted to that due to by many previous reviews on Amazon (really great forum by the way :)Still, the camera has some great features I would like to highlight:- the articulate screen, wonderful for finding new perspectives and for unobtrusive photography- the inbuilt B/W and sepia programs, I marvelled at how good some pohotos look when you convert them- the LCD screen is excellent for viewing pictures and the possibility to flip it over for protection and saving battery life (if you can tolerate the viewfinder) is very practical.All in all I like the camera, and would recomemnd it as a solid, workable, well performing piece for mobile photography in very decent quality. Don't expect it to replace your SLR, but rather compliment it. I gave it 4 stars due to poor speed and viewfinder, if these issues were resolved it would easily qualify as the best option in the class of point and shoot cameras.", "Date": "December 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Canon G11 SDHC Memory Recommendation and Features", "Author": "Brett", "ReviewID": "RIS64SLKJSKYV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll get around to the memory recommendation in a minute. I purchased the Canon G11 and a Canon underwater housing (130' rated) for scuba diving. The combo works very well together. The camera has an underwater preset mode which produces exceptional scuba diving photos. The G11 was a little intimidating at first but after a few hours of punching buttons and reading the manual, it was clear that the camera has many advanced features and wasn't all that difficult to use. It includes numerous preset modes, (underwater,snow,portrait,action,foliage,etc,etc,etc)to make taking great pictures easy. I was truly inpressed with the possibilities. I have taken numerous stills (with and without enhancements)and videos. The photos and video have been impressive. It can do color swap, and color enhancements, like taking a picture of a child holding a red rose and only the red rose has color, the child can remain black and white. Very cool stuff.Back to the memory thing....I wanted to know what Size (GB) and Class (2,4,6,10) of SDHC card Canon recommended to optimize the cameras performance. The new SDHC cards have a Size in gigabytes and a Class. (Some cards show a Multiplier like 100x, 133x or even 400x). The Class and the Multiplier are essentially the same thing, transfer speeds. The bigger the number the faster the transfer rate.The camera doesn't come with a memory card and the manual doesn't tell you what to buy. So, I sent a note to Canon and they responded within 24 hours and answered me on a Sunday. \"Thumbs up\" on Canon Customer Service.Here is there response:Thank you for writing to us regarding Memory card choices for your PowerShot G11.While we don't publish the internal transfer rates for our cameras, the following information may assist you in deciding on memory cards:Some memory cards rate their speeds by a \"class.\" Canon cameras are recommended to be used with cards rated are class 4 for SD (Standard Definition movies) and class 6 for HD (High Definition Movies) or higher because of the large amount of data being written to the card. As long as the card adheres to the following card standards, the memory card should be compatible regardless of the class or speed rating.The PowerShot G11 will accept SDHC memory cards with a capacity of up to 32GB.My Comments:The cost for the SDHC cards vary all over the place. I have used a Class 2 card and it seemed to work fine. However, I wanted to see if bigger and faster was better so I ordered a Verbatim 16GB, Class 6 ($52). I got a \"memory card error\" with two of my cameras and now have to return it. (It was big, fast and cheap, but didn't work). I have two other Sandisk Class 4 cards that work fine. So go with Sandisk. A little more money, but they work. I picked up a Sandisk SDHC 8GB Class 10 for around $58, shipped. The 8GB card gives you around 2990 photos or 240 minutes of video. The larger capacity cards seem to be exponentially more expensive. The Class 10 is fast enough for good recovery time between shots and high quality video. The Canon manual lists several different type of compatible memory, but go with the SDHC card.I hope you find this helpful.....it's a great camera, packed with features, and if you're into scuba diving...even better.", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot G11 review", "Author": "Gary Wilson \"Gary Wilson Photo/Graphic\"", "ReviewID": "R1FC0W3FBCPOAU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Over time I've owned nearly all the PowerShot G system cameras and still have the G1 and G2 for sentimental reasons.

I am very disappointed with it, and more specifically with Canon's customer service.  (No problem with Amazon.)  The white balance is clearly defective.

They acknowledged a defective optical assembly, replaced it, and sent the camera back to me two weeks later.  The problem remains.  I uploaded comparison digital images from my cheaper, old Canon A-95 (which are accurate in color) and my new, defective G-11.  Canon's tech support people were very nice and suggested a few tweaks, which didn't help.  I then dealt with Canon's customer service.  Because this camera has been defective from the start, I asked Canon to exchange this G-11 for a new one rather than waste two more weeks of my warranty time shipping the camera back and forth.  I uploaded many more images to them and Canon customer service said they would bump the issue up to the senior engineers and that I would hear back quickly.  I'm still waiting.  I am sorry I ever bought this camera.  Prior to this experience, I had been a loyal owner of Canon cameras since 1971!UPDATE:  I finally heard back from Canon.  They told me that the sensing mechanism in the G-11 is so sophisticated that it will see yellow light even if my eye perceives white!  They sent me a photo taken in their own lab which was as yellow as mine. (Why would they think this is acceptable?)  They said the solution is to use the \"P\" mode rather than the \"auto\" mode.  This did little to correct the situation.  And I SHOULD be able to use the \"auto\" mode on a $450 camera! Canon also suggested that the problem might be the lighting in my house; however, I had the same yellow color with three different types of lighting - compact florescent, halogen, and incandescent.

The Canon G11 is the first such camera I have seen that can actually come very close to matching the quality of some DSLRs, but in a much smaller package.I purchased my G11 in November 2009 as my daughter was about to be married and I wanted to be able to snap images of the day with a small camera even though I had hired another professional photographer (actually one of my assistants) to \"officially\" photograph the event. I also picked up a Canon 270 EX flash and let me tell you this combination is really quite impressive. I shot most of the photos at ISO 400- ISO 800 and am quite pleased with the image quality. I shoot exclusively RAW files and process them in the Canon DPP software to eek out the absolute best image quality that the small sensor has to offer.As a general rule, shooting at the lowest ISO possible is a good idea if you want the cleanest file possible. However, the G11's noise pattern is somewhat more like some high speed film emulsions and so it can actually be used for creative effect if desired. Nice. However, at speeds of up to ISO 400 and 800 the noise is very well controlled for such a small sensor camera and allows the creation of very clean prints to at least 11\"x14\" size and possibly larger. At lower ISO settings, significantly larger prints are possible. I have created 16\"x20\" prints from this camera shot at ISO 200 that I will be exhibiting in an upcoming gallery show. Really quite impressive from a compact camera.The articulating LCD screen is a wonderful addition to the G11 after being absent for a few years from this line of cameras. Besides that, it is very crisp and the colors are fantastic. I find myself shooting at waist level quite a bit using the LCD to frame shots in much the same way as I used to with old 2 1/4 film cameras.Another pleasant surprise is the quality of the video that this camera creates. While it is not Hi-def, it is very smooth and even the sound quality is quite good. Couple that with the low noise this camera is capable of and you end up with very nice video clips if you so desire.Of course, like any compact camera, there are some things that could be better. The G11 is pretty fast, but is not going to be as responsive as a DSLR. The zoom range of the lens is very useful, however, getting precise focal lengths is not easy with the motorized zoom. I do not find this to be a problem just something to be aware of. The optical viewfinder is somewhat useful, but more framing accuracy would be better. You do not lose anything when framing with the optical finder, you simply end up with a bit more in your shots than what you saw in the finder which can later be cropped out if desired. I find I am actually not using the optical viewfinder as much as I thought I would so this has definitely not been a problem. The LCD screen is 100% accurate...WSWYG.Like any piece of photographic equipment, the more you use it, the more familiar you become with it and the more it becomes an extension of you. For now, I think this camera is probably the best all around compact digital camera on the market from many standpoints.

This camera was available for \"Pre-Order\" from Amazon for $499.00 and as soon as it arrived it stores the price on Amazon shot up (over 650.00 at one point).  So I purchased it from Best Buy for $499.00.  Another reason I purchased from Best Buy is because of the extended warranty I could get.  I plan on using this camera kayaking and the possibility of dropping it in the water or getting it wet made the extended (all things covered) warranty a must. Amazon's extended warranties through N.E.W. are worse than awful and I know that from experience.OKAY review the camera already:This is a review for people who are neither professional photographers nor pretending to be.  I currently own a Nikon N65 (film) circa 2002 and an Olympus OM-1 film camera.  My wife uses the Nikon extensively and we love that camera.  IF Nikon made a point and shoot camera like this I would have bought it over Canon, however, they don't.  No, Nikon Coolpix are their offerings and they are too big, too small or just too expensive.This is my first digital camera.  I have tried using friend's cameras, and tried countless ones in stores but I have always hated the feel of them because of the size of my hands.  I blame myself.  I was beginning to think all point and shoot digital cameras were made by and for Lilliputians.  Like most people my age I wear eye glasses.  Being able to see the LCD is fundamental and with all the point and shoot cameras I've tried I can't see the LCD without my reading glasses.  (I don't usually carry them \"in the field\" (sorry for the professional jargon).  Furthermore, out in the sun if the LCD didn't rotate, I couldn't see the screen even if I did have my reading glasses.  The LCD on this camera is exceptional not only because of the tilting ability, but because of the resolution; lots of colors, clarity and contrast.  I can make out the image without pulling out my reading glasses.  Even in the sun I could make out the screen very, very well.  Having a viewfinder is also a great advantage on sunny days!  Not many point and shoot cameras have view finders.The camera is very easy to set up and get started.  The instruction manual is good (a great manual would be bigger, have larger type and be made of a water resistant paper).  The menu (actually the entire camera) is very intuitive and very easy for us old curmudgeons to embrace and get to know.  If you've bought a camera in the last ten years (including the $20.00 throw away ones from the grocery store) you will have no problem using this camera and you won't even have to open the manual.  The On/Off button is very easy to find and you'll be off and running.  There are not a lot of buttons to become familiar with either and as I said the menu system is very easy to navigate.I am a computer guy but hate electronic devices (go figure).  My twelve year old son was showing me how to do things with the camera after he played with it for a half hour or so in the back set of my car; I call that intuitive by any standard.  I know kids are more into electronics these days, but this is not an Xbox we are talking about.  He had to figure out on his own how to navigate around and did pretty well.  He saved me from reading a few pages of the manual.  So easy even a twelve year old can do it!  I love the fact that this thing can take videos as well.  You can't zoom in or out once you start recording but you can always stop and change your field of vision and begin again.The included software for PC's is easy to install and use. I have not used all of its features yet as I use PhotoShop for picture editing.The Good the Bad and the Ugly - I am not a professional photographer (again).  But I know an SLR from a point and shoot.  I know the fundamentals of taking a picture.  I know that letting the camera make up its mind on settings (aperture, Shutter speed, ISO speed etc.) is like me setting the cruise control in my SUV then taking my hands off the steering wheel and expecting the vehicle to get me home safely.  Come on; let's be serious for a moment.  For those folks offering negative thoughts or reviews based on using the Auto/Auto function/setting, then saying that \"they think the photos could be better\", well all I can say is DAH! Play around, it doesn't use FILM, erase!!!!! Take more shots, try again, review the photos BEFORE you get home (that would be a good idea.  I think that's why these were invented, so we didn't have to wait for the development of the film to find out we missed a shot!!!).This camera is well suited for those looking for a balance between high priced DLSR's and point and shoot convenience with excellent picture quality.  It will not fit in a shirt pocket (unless you are wearing size: Paul Bunyan) but if you wear loose fitting pants or jeans (a normal men's style pant found worn by a normal man in the year 2009), the camera will fit in either the front or back pockets just fine.My only complaint is the size of the manual (roughly 4X5 inches) and the type of paper it's made from.  I don't expect this camera to do things a thousand dollar camera should do.  I bought it because you don't have to be a rocket scientist, or techno geek to use it.  AND people who have larger hands and fingers can use it easily; you don't have to have hands and fingers the size of an underweight eight year old to feel comfortable using this camera.

So I purchased the G11 PhotoMed Attachment in addition, which I used for 1 month.  I was getting much better quality in terms of depth of field, but I was still having a problem with the lighting.  With the Photomed Attachment, I was getting a more even balance of lighting with their mirrors and plastic diffuser on the lens, but NOT GOOD ENOUGH.  I was still getting dark buccal corridors which I really didn't like. HOWEVER, The P-Mode (Portrait or Program) extraorals (Straight, Profile, and Smiling) were MUCH better than my Canon G7.  It was the intraorals that I was not happy with.SO I purchased a LED Ring Light DigiSlave 3200 instead and I was able to solve my problem with Buccal Corridors.  Digi-Slave L-Ring 3200, Powerful, Versatile LED Ring Light with Focusing Light, Removable Diffuser, Continuous or Flash for Digital Macro PhotographyI was able to get light all the way back to the molars.  However, I was sacrificing a small amount of depth of field because I no longer used a macro lens.  But I didn't need a macro lens because the G11 Macro Feature was great for orthodontic purposes.If you are looking to take Full Retracted Smile, Buccals, Occlusals and Extraoral Profiles (ORTHODONTICS and BEFORE/AFTER ANTERIOR CASES), then you should definitely buy the Canon G11 with LED Right Light DigiSlave L-Ring 3200 (+adapter).If you are looking to take 1:1 or 1:2 photos of 1-2 teeth, then you should probably get the PhotoMed G11 Attachment.  The uneven lighting won't bother you since your field of view (ie: 15-25mm) is small.The price difference is $700 for the PhotoMed and about $225 for the LED Digislave Right Light, so I would save $475 and get the one with better lighting.EXTRAORAL SETTINGS:  Set to Portrait/Program, Turn Flash on.  Change the White Balance to Flourescent since I shoot in the office.  The photos turn out even better than with the G7.  The Key to this is to FOCUS (press 1/2 way down) while aiming the camera at the patient's chest or arm and then bring it up to the face.  If you don't do this, then you will most likely focus on the wall and not on the face.INTRAORAL: Set to AV, F8, Custom White Balance to a Gray Color. Turn on Macro Mode and you're set. Zoom about 80% of the way on Optical Zoom only, not digital zoom.  The G-Series's LCD screen is incredibly easier to take photos than the dSLR BIG camera body.  Relatively same quality photos without the hassel.Please message me if you have any questions.", "Date": "October 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera, but . . .", "Author": "Jody Ann Burch", "ReviewID": "R3BF43ETG3QKTG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been playing with this little camera for about a week now.  Let me throw in here that I've been doing photography as an advanced amateur/sometimes professional for a very long time, using Nikon SLR equipment exclusively.  However I've postponed switching to digital until just recently.  This was of course prompted by an increasing scarcity of services available for film and the need to share photos over the internet.I decided to abandon Nikon and defect to Canon based on both personal experience and reviews.  For the personal experience part I was given a Nikon Coolpix 5000 to play with.  What a clumsy piece to use.  But it did give good results once beaten into submission.  Following that up we needed a digital for my wife to take on a trip to the U.K.  We decided on the Nikon P90 because of it's physical size, MP size and it's 24:1 zoom range.  This camera too gives good work, but seems very difficult to work with in the Macro mode and some other things.  Possibly from lack of experience with it.Based on that I began looking at other options and decided to defect to the Canon camp.  So far I am very happy with the G11, particularly in the ease of use category.  I have only one complaint, and that's the optical viewfinder.I realize that most people don't use that much these days, preferring instead to use the camera-held-at-arms length stance to view the LCD.  To me this is inviting camera shake, image stabilization or not, and is just a clumsy way to take pictures - in my opinion.  It's also iffy in some lighting situations.  I prefer the optical finder when I can use it.Back in the \"old days\" of rangefinder 35mm cameras Leica, Canon, Nikon, et al had some wonderful bright frame finders that zoomed, parallax corrected, and in some cases even changed frame size to acommodate the difference in lens coverage at different focusing ranges.  Why can't they (Canon in this case) resurrect that technology now?  The G11 has no frame lines, no parallax correction lines, no even a box to indicate where the AF zone is.  Even the clumsy Coolpix 5000 has that.If the G11 had that sort of finder it would be perfect for me.  As it is it's very good; I can learn to live with the finder.  But if the finder was improved it would be a lot better.Canon PowerShot G11 10MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Stabilized Zoom and 2.8-inch articulating LCD", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's the sensor!", "Author": "Patrick Denker", "ReviewID": "RGXONHO8DSM7K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A brilliant point-and-shoot camera for image quality, low-light performance and advanced controls. The G11, like its slimmer sister the S90, uses a bigger light sensor (the heart of any digital camera) than any other point-and-shoot on the market. It won't give you the image quality at higher ISO speeds (i.e. in low-light) that you'd get on a DSLR, but it's a big step in that direction, and vastly superior to all other point-and-shoot cameras in that regard; image quality up to ISO 800, and even 1000, is just fine! That means you can shoot in low-light, indoor conditions without the flash and get lovely natural-lighting results with perfectly acceptable image quality.The G11 is definitely bulkier than other point-and-shoot cameras, but will fit in a pocket and is still much smaller than either an SLR or even any \"SLR-style\" super-zoom camera. I had an S5 IS super-zoom and often left it at home because of its bulk. Not the G11.Another advantage of the G11 is its slightly lower megapixel count. As serious photo enthusiasts have long complained, cramming more and more megapixels onto the same small sensor merely results in high-res versions of grainy, noisy pictures. Fewer/larger pixels on the sensor means better image quality (less noise) and better low-light performance. Kudos Canon!The G11's only drawbacks are its lack of HD video and the fact that its LCD -- which is big, bright, twist-out and ultra-sharp -- is poorly color-calibrated, showing much more color saturation than the scene (or resultant photo) contains. It's a small quibble, and presumably something that Canon can and will address in a firmware update.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect step up from a point and shoot", "Author": "B.

I started considering the G11 when I reached a point where I wanted to do things with my photography that the 790IS was simply incapable of.There are three main reasons why the G11 has been perfect for me:1. I take a lot of pictures of food (and never use a flash in restaurants), so the low light performance was very attractive. Except for some far more expensive SLRs, I haven't seen anything that matches the G11's low light performance.2. I love taking pictures from interesting perspectives, so the articulated LCD really helps when I'm composing shots from those angles.3. The G11 has lots of dials, which saves a ton of time when trying different settings while shooting. While the G11's menus are easy to understand (especially if you've used a Canon before), going though on-screen menus is slow and generally a pain. The physical dials make changing the settings fast and painless.I'm very happy with this camera and would recommend it to anyone looking for the next step up from a point and shoot.", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Charles Pettis", "ReviewID": "R2FNINRK913L4X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review of the Canon G 11 reflects my own tests and opinions.I used a Canon Eos 40-D for years.

The comparison on inside pictures in lower light leave the G-9 in the dust. Results are fantastic.The 40-D high speed shooting is, on occasion, very useful.

Often when I was photographing children, the lagtime on the photo being taken was so long that a child would change expressions, talk to another person in the room, turn around and move out of the picture before the photograph was done.  Yes, in spite of my love for my Sony Cybershot with the Carl Zeiss lens, it was time to replace the camera.  The G11 has changed my photographs dramatically.  Certainly, in low light situations, there will still be some lagtime but nothing like most cameras.  This camera takes photographs to a whole new level.My husband, who is an artist and photographer, has been insisting for years that my abilities were higher than the camera I have been using (albeit not so high that I need to use his Hasselblad) and he finally made an argument that made it worth my while to change cameras.  We would not use my Carl Weiss has a hand-me-down, but instead I could keep it.Suffice it to say that after a few weeks of using this camera and seeing the beauty of raw files and the gorgeous detail, I handed down my old camera voluntarily.  I still use film cameras for some pictures and situations but there is almost no reason to anymore for my purposes.  Film and the process of making photographs in the old way still have a certain beauty to them if one enjoys darkroom work.This camera can be used as a manual camera for those who still prefer to make their own decisions about what is happening in the picture.  So many times, you have to work to trick automatic point and shoot cameras to avoid automatic settings.  This camera allows you to make choices to be in control of the picture.There are a lot of interesting technical details to this camera that a lot of people more qualified than I have talked about.One of the most significant improvements in this camera is its capacity for raw capture.  Raw files can be processed outside the camera with software programs without altering the information that was in the original capture.  All cameras have some kind of compression or processing algorhythms, which permanently alter the image content.  Raw file capability allows images to be processed by special purpose software, like Photoshop and others, without altering the information of the original capture.  The raw file is essentially your negative.One of the paradoxical improvements over its predecessor is that Canon reduced the resolution of the sensor and improved image quality.  They have enhanced performance at higher ISOs.

You can't expect it to be something it is not intended to be. But if you like DSL cameras and don't want to lug one around, you can't go wrong here! The ease of use, the easy access to the settings (placed on top)fast shutter speed and multiple settings both manual and automatic, these are  just some of the fine features of this amazing camera. I enjoy the wieght and construction of the body as well. No flimsy door to mess with, great durability and simply sturdy construct. Shooting in RAW is great for those of us that edit in Photoshop, and I must admit with a good quality SD card, such as extreme III with a 8 gig or so, you can take a lot of pics on one card even in RAW. I do NOT use this camera for shooting video, I wanted a camera, not a camcorder...so baring that in mind I cannot say anything regarding the video features, to me they are meaningless. The camera has good stabilization, and once you get to really know the ins and outs of the various settings (trust me there are PLENTY) then noise reduction, image clarity are all very capable of being achieved to bring forth the finest quality of photo's you desire. I do suggest that you purchase a pocket guide for this camera (it ranges from 10 bucks on amazon, to what I paid, 14 bucks at local national chain bookstore) so that you can really master all that this camera has to offer.I have had NO PROBLEMS with battery life at all. Now bare in mind as most photographers will suggest, have a spare fully charged battery at all times! I declined buying a spare for nearly triple the cost at a local camera shop and purchased my battery online through Amazon and saved big time. Shipping was FAST and the battery was brand new as described. Again let me state clearly, you WANT a spare battery regardless of the fact the battery has a good life span on a single charge, you don't want to push it, and be left stranded!I do like the rotation of the screen for various angles. I shot a concert with this camera and it was extremely helpful in tight spots getting caught up in and above the \"Pit\". It is also very helpful for level shooting for low shots and not wanting to bend, or high shots that you want to have the foundation of the shot leveled off, allowing for example buildings to be level and not having to squat down as low etc.If you shoot using a high resolution, then croping is going to be your best friend in addition to the 5x zoom. You can bring your pictures in close up during a crop and maintain the clarity and low noise. One thing to explain the ISO is NOT the same (exactly anyway) as the ISO of a film camera, so remember this, get your guide book and play around with the ISO settings that best suite your shooting conditions.I have read some negative things about this camera, and have summed it up to, lack of experience with the camera, lack of understanding what the purpose is for this type of camera, and over expectations, (such as slamming it for not being a camcorder, duh,...it's a CAMERA!) It is NOT a DSL, it is a compact, dang near a DSL, and you cannot go wrong if compact, quality, and variablity is what you are looking for! I HIGHLY suggest it as a purchase! I have already reffered several friends to purchase it and they have and love it!I have sold stock photo's, and have sold retail, know a little about what I am doing, and I can do some amazing things with this camera. Would not trade it for the world! Think Compact, close to DSL, not a cam, and has major versality, and you got the \"Picture\". For novice users, this camera is user friendly without a doubt. For advanced users, it's all good!!! Hope this helps, and enjoy our art, that's what it is ultimately about!

Let me count the ways:1, Ok, let me say this up front: Yes, the so-called \"High Sensitivity System\" works, and works as advertised. It's better in low light than Panasonic's LX3 (same sized sensor and faster lens), or any of the legendary Fuji \"Super CCD\" cameras like the F30 or F31, or their successor EXR cameras (though its not leaps and bounds better when the Fujis are in EXR mode). Heck, its almost a match for Panasonic's 4/3 GF1 (to be fair this might be because the GF1 doesn't process JPG's as well, that's a MUCH larger sensor) Part of the advantage is in the bigger photo-sites on the CCD, the aperture at the wide end helps too, but neither explains the low light performance entirely imo. Truth be told, from the samples I've seen, the G10 was also better in low light than I would have expected. I don't know what other voodoo Canon has up their sleeve here, but regardless, this camera takes usable pics at 800 ISO, and even 1600 ISO. Even 3200 ISO might still produce a usable 4*6.2, Awesome lens. This is the best quality lens I've ever seen or even heard of on a compact. The only issue I notice is minor chromatic aberration (purple fringing) at 100% when viewed on the computer. None to be seen in prints at least as large as 8*10 even in bright light. Yes you can also edit this out with the supplied software if you shoot raw. Otherwise, sharp, clear, beautiful, damn near flawless from edge to edge.3, Best stabilizer I've ever used. My last camera was a Panasonic TZ3, stabilizers are one of Panasonic's strengths, but this one is noticeably better. It gives me crystal clear shots at focal length/shutter speed combinations the TZ3 wasn't capable of.4, Great layout. Intuitive and customizable controls make manual mode easier to use than any other camera I've tried. This was a huge plus for me. I knew how to manually set exposure before I owned this camera, but I wasn't practiced enough to reliably capture a shot of anything that wasn't standing still unless I left it in auto or program. With the G11, I could actually leave it in manual mode all the time, from the first day.5, Excellent build quality. This is my first G, so I don't know how it compares to its ancestors, but compared to any other compact I've seen its built like a tank. Frankly, its better built than Canon's entry level SLR's. Nikon's too.6, Beautiful high resolution LCD.7, EPIC battery life. This appears to be the same battery the Rebel XSI and T1I use. It says its good for 400 shots. All I know is after 300 shots over the course of a week, I still showed 2/3 full.8, Very powerful onboard flash for a compact. And its adjustable of course.9, Almost comically powerful AF assist light. With AF assist engaged, focus times in the dark are pretty much indistinguishable from focus times in daylight.10, Shoots almost as fast in RAW mode as it does with JPEGs. Can also shoot RAW and JPEG at the same time.11, Extremely tight macro mode. Can focus at less than 1cm (though there are substantial lens artifacts if you do)12, Extremely accurate Autofocus13, Continuous shooting is nearly unlimited14, So I don't make this longer than necessary I'll cram the rest in here: wide end aperture goes all the way to 2.8 which is getting to be a rarity, shutter speed ranges up to 1/4000, has removable ring for converter lenses, METAL tripod socket, LCD swivels and tilts, viewfinder is not nearly as cheap as other compacts (though still not great) many highly customizable options I've barely explored like adjustable saturation and sharpening.You get the idea. This is a wonderful camera. It stands head and shoulders above any previous compact I've purchased, and all my earlier ones (Panasonic LZ5, Canon A710, Panasonic TZ3) were well above average.It's not perfect of course. There are a few quibbles1, Shot to shot time is surprisingly slow. Nearly 2 seconds between shots, and continuous shooting is at less than 2 frames per second. Slower continuous shooting than my LZ5 which is 4 years older, and was about half the price even then.2, It's a little on the bulky side (which isn't all bad, it feels good in my hand) you aren't carrying this in a shirt pocket, and you'll be lucky to get it into a pants pocket if you don't wear cargo pants. It does fit well in jacket pockets though.3, In spite of the bulk, there are plenty of cheaper cameras out there with much longer zooms. Its telephoto is exactly half as long as my old TZ3. You can buy telephoto converters to increase the range (and I'll probably do this eventually), but they effectively shrink the aperture while you use them (pics get darker), the converter isn't stabilized, and who knows if the converter lens is anywhere near as good as the G11's lens?4, There is no \"Superfine\" JPEG option. My 10mp JPEG photos are actually smaller files than my highest quality 7mp photos from my TZ3. So far no major complaints about the \"Fine\" level of compression (and to be fair not only do I have the RAW option, but my \"fine\" only JPEGs do hold up under a higher magnification than the TZ3's \"Superfine\" 7mp photos, but still on a camera like this, you'd think I'd get more than 2 levels of JPEG compression, or at least that the highest quality compression would be available.5, This is an expensive camera. MSRP $500. Amazon helped me out by selling it $50 cheaper, and throwing in free shipping, but this is still not cheap. In fact, the MSRP is only $50 lower than Canon's entry level SLR, the Rebel XS.Bottom line: Except for the speed issue (which isn't terrible, just slightly disappointing) and my quibble about the number of JPEG settings I get, these are really more trade-offs than true shortcomings. The camera is bulky and expensive because of all those great things I raved about earlier in the review (high quality lens, powerful flash, solid construction, huge battery, ect.) I bought this camera because I wanted something that was really a cut above what I owned, but I couldn't justify an SLR to myself, because I didn't think I'd take the time to learn to use one (their menu systems are surprisingly complicated if you want to venture outside the preset scene modes), and anyway, I didn't think I'd bother to lug an SLR around often enough to take many pictures. Given my particular wants and needs,I basically could not be more satisfied, and highly recommend this to anyone with similar requirements. However, like any product, this isn't for absolutely everyone. If you're deadly serious about photography, and you're on a budget, get the Rebel XS  kit instead (or even the Nikon D40). The G11 works wonders with what it has, but its not as good as a camera with full sized interchangeable lenses and an APS sized sensor. If you already have an SLR and want a high quality backup, get the Canon S90 instead (its the G11's stablemate, same awesome sensor, high quality lens, full manual controls, its much smaller and lighter and lists about $70 cheaper. In exchange, you get a shorter zoom, and it also lacks the G11's tanklike body, huge battery, ect). You can also get a Micro 4/3 \"Electric Viewfinder Interchangeable Lens\" (SLR sensor, smaller body, no SLR viewfinder) from Samsung, Panasonic, and Olympus now if you have deep pockets and are mostly shooting wider angle (they'll take tele lenses, but they're pretty unwieldy with a long lens). If like me, you're after a very high quality do-it-all camera that will fit in a jacket pocket, then the Canon G11 is simply the best digital there is. Its well worth $500, and I'd highly recommend it to you, hence my enthusiastic title and tag. I love my G11. In good light (say enough to make 1/60 or faster, F2.8-F3.5, and ISO 200 or darker come out properly exposed) it will make prints at least as large as 8*12 that are indistinguishable from a consumer level SLR, at least to my eye.", "Date": "January 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Quality control not up to Canon standards", "Author": "Matthew Vosburgh", "ReviewID": "R396XBUTD5MR3Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Love the size and the many hardware dials. The sensitivity in low light is terrific. The pictures are not bad for a camera with a sensor this small (and it is a small sensor).Many people opt for the S90 (& S95), as that line is closely related in internal hardware, but is smaller and with a brighter f/2.0 lens.Mine had one flaw right out of the box, a big fleck of black plastic stuck in the middle of the viewfinder optics, but I use the viewfinder so rarely I let it slide.Then about a day after the 1 year warranty expired, so did the internal backup battery. It is not user-replaceable, and without it the camera requires you to set the date and time every time you turn it on.

Canon claim it can be fixed by inserting a fully charged battery and leaving the camera overnight, or by leaving the camera plugged into their expensive optional wall adapter, but neither approach worked for me.

VANDALEN", "ReviewID": "R2YKT78ADQHKU8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As much as I love shooting with my Canon 7D, there are times when it just isn't practical to carry around a bulky camera and bag with additional lenses, flash, etc.  The G11 made the most sense for a point & shoot choice since it is more advanced than most other choices in the price range and offers flexibility of settings control for those more serious shooters. My first digital camera was the Canon G2, so it just seemed appropriate to return to the \"G\" series.Why the G11 and not the Canon S90?  While the S90 is one of the best compact point & shoot cameras going in its price range, for me the G11 has several key must-have features the S90 does not: 1) hotshoe so I can use the same flash unit for the 7D and have much better lighting options than the onboard flash as a result, 2) articulated screen which is an essential for stealth shooting of people for better candid shots, 3) 5x magnification as opposed to 3.8x for the S90.  Some will argue that the S90 has a faster lens than the G11, but keep in mind that is only at the widest focal range.  When each are zoomed in, the G11 equals and then surpasses the S90 while adding 1.2x more magnification.  The manual EV, ISO and mode dials are also a big plus.After several weeks of shooting with the G11, I have grown fond of its overall performance.  However, there are three areas that have come to annoy me with respect to image quality and handling.  The first is the apparent limited dynamic range in that highlights will always be clipped or \"blown out.\" Take a picture in direct sunlight and sunlight areas on light objects such as flesh or light fabric will be pure white.  Even bright objects on cloudy days show the same behavior.  The best way to correct for this other than shooting in RAW and manual settings is to set the EV exposure control from minus 1 1/3 to minus 2 and turn on the i-contrast feature.  Turning down the EV will retain more details in bright areas while the i-contrast feature will then recover lost detail in the dark areas made more dark from the negative EV setting.  It seems to work pretty well, but you still may need to make post-processing adjustments.The second gripe I have with the G11 is the performance of the on board flash.  Most of the time I have to \"dial-in\" the flash brightness and exposure compensation to get the best exposure with flash.  This is not comforting when you only have the chance for one shot that counts.  Closer or further shots will require constant flash/exposure tuning or else you'll risk overly bright or under exposed shots. Addition of the 430 EX II flash used in bounce mode is the best way to go here - but the flash unit is bigger than the camera.The third issue I have with the camera is more of a subjective one - handling.  While this is still a rather \"large\" point & shoot, it's still too small for my hands.  What I find is that I am hitting buttons and changing settings simply when trying to hold the camera for a shot.  There is just no room for your thumb and fingers to securely hold this thing (always have a neck or wrist strap on when using). Sometimes just opening the fold out screen introduces a bit of risk in dropping the camera. In that regard, smaller and simpler point and shoot cameras may actually be easier to handle.  I can understand now why many people using p&s; cameras always seem to have several non-use fingers pointing away in different directions.Despite the issues I mentioned above, the G11 is still a nice camera to have with you as a travel backup or when you don't have a pressing need for the DSLR.  For the best results,  it needs its user to know how to use and work with the many setting features as with an SLR.  It is not small enough to put in your pocket, especially if put first in a protective carrying case.  A travel case for the G11 would either have to go on a belt or in a large purse.  On the plus side: it's still much more compact than the classic 'ol G2.Update (10/24/10): After several months of continual use for when I'm not lugging around my 7D and lenses, I am reminded of the G11 - and virtually all point-and-shoot - limitations.  While a good DSLR can be turned on, pointed, zoomed and shot in as quick as one to two seconds, I've found that the G11 will take from five to six seconds to do the same.  Sometimes the zoom is non-responsive on the first try.  This is mainly an issue if you do that type of photography where you need to capture something quickly.  If you try to capture something like a hit-and-run, for instance - forget it. Within its limitations, however, the camera has worked well.  I have noticed that the mic system for video on the G11 is apparently very sensitive to wireless signals, resulting in a continuous \"crackle\" sound if someone has a bluetooth on.  In the exact same shooting environment (a vanpool), my 7D does not have an audio issue when shooting video.  The main complaint I have with the G11 at this point is ergonomics: the camera is just too small to have the external controls it has.  Many times I am inadvertantly pressing options on the multi-function dial without knowing it and suddenly switching to manual focus, or changing the custom color options for video just by holding the camera and opening the flip-out screen. DSLRs are large mainly in part to allowing for optimal ergonomics/quick camera handling with the multitude of external control buttons they have.  The G11 is just too small for similar controls as there is no place to securely hold the camera (you end up doing the typical p&s; holding routine of non-essential fingers pointed away from the camera in different directions).  It is also a bit difficult at times to grip the edge of the flip-out screen with the left thumb and open it.  I do like the dials at the top of the camera for EV and ISO but would like to have aperture and shutter speed there as well.  Perhaps beyond the G12, Canon will revisit the ergonomic approach.

I gotten some good quality pictures and the camera has met most of my expectations.  I normally use a Nikon D-90 and am used to framing my pictures through an eyepiece.  This was particularly important to me when out on the water as the strong sunlight makes it difficult to shoot using the LCD monitor in all situation.  The biggest disappointment with this camera is the inaccuracy of the viewfinder.  The user's manual says that the viewfinder has a field of vision of approximately 77% of the actual shooting image.  Therefore, I realized the camera's viewfinder would not display the entire frame I was shooting -- but it is also completely off center.  I tried taking a photo of a large rock in the water expecting that the resulting photo would have space all around in excess of what I saw in the viewfinder.  To my surprise, the image cut off the top of the rock and the additional space was at the bottom of the image.  This seems to negate the purpose of even having a viewfinder.

I had however been shooting from a 450D so had simply got use to that sensor quality, so i was quite harsh on the camera in the beginning.The camera has fantastic functions with an easy to use positioning of the ISO and F stop dial, which gives the feel of a DSLR. When shooting in manual mode it can be a little slow alternating between shutter speed and aperture, as you use a button and shared jog dial. The auto mode is great for quick shots, however i have discovered, in order to get a far superior quality, shoot in a mode that allows for RAW images. Disappointingly, there is no HD video, which is odd as most of the competition has picked up on this technology. The only thing i am not entirely in love with is the white balance modes. I often get blue tinged images, this is however fixed in 2 seconds in photoshop, or with some more time playing around.The camera has an amazing amount of preset scenes, for anything from fireworks, to underwater conditions. The night mode is good, however don't expect any amazing pictures as the camera goes into a mode skyrocketing the ISO way beyond the maximum of 3200 indicated on the ISO dial. The aperture levels are very responsive, it would have been good for the level to go beyond 8.My images also significantly bettered when i focused on maintaining really low ISO levels, rarely going over 400. Photos still look great at 800 and are fine at 1600, you see quite a bit of noise at 3200.When tweaking images in photoshop you understand the real advantage of this camera over an everyday, or even good point and shoot, as the photos true detail is made apparent. I have taken photos which have turned out with plain white skies. After working with the shadows and curves i find highly detailed, vibrant blue sky and cloud definition.For this price i highly recommended this camera, just allow for time to play around with the settings, or to go through a field guide to produce really awesome shots!P.S I did a lot of research before choosing this camera, including the Olympus Pen (great sensor, but slow functionality and limited features) Lumix FZ38 (Awesome zoom, lower picture quality, odd bulky shape) and canon powershot Sx1 is (better picture quality than Lumix, great zoom, odd bulky shape)Good luck!", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very satisfied with G11", "Author": "S.

The G11 is an advanced camera that I wouldn't recommend to the average snap-shooter, but it is a camera I would recommend to someone who has a DSLR kit and would like to have a small camera as a back-up or to carry around. The advanced photographer will experience a camera that tries to reproduce the old range-finder experience (in terms of control and heft). I say \"tries to reproduce . . . \" because it is a digital camera and the G11 is not be as instantaneous or as responsive as its film counterparts, but it rewards forethought and planning with great images. I was tempted to invest in the micro four-thirds system, especially Panasonic's great GF-1, but it meant investing in another system of bodies and lenses. I may still be tempted to do this in future, but only as a DSLR replacement. The G11, on the other hand, while not being able to meet the same standards as a DSLR or micro four-thirds camera, does operate well as a 'bridge' camera.Things I really like about the G11 are its viewfinder (not perfect, but useful), its dedicated mechanical controls, its improved noise results, RAW files, good battery life, build and the articulated screen. I don't use the screen to compose very often, but it is useful to review results. Something that could be done better is the AF and burst speeds.

Two qualities I wanted, in addition to clean images were a view finder and flip out LCD. Actually I had boiled down my choices to the G11, the Canon S95 and the Lumix LX5. All three are great cameras and once you had one I don't think you would be disappointed with any of them. The biggest reason I choose the G11 was because it was the only one with a view finder and the flip out LCD. I'm not disappointed.Granted the view finder is not that great and it only shows about 75 to 80% of the scene, but so did the A95, and it was easy for me to pick up on what I needed to see through the view finder to know what was going to be in the finished image. It's not that hard to do. Using the camera this way I not only get sharper images but it saves on battery life as well. By holding the camera against my face, along with the image stabilization I don't have to worry about holding the camera steady when using the LCD and holding the camera out from the body.I use the image stabilization on shoot only, on general shapshots I will either leave the ISO on auto and in the P mode and let the camera do the work or I will leave the ISO on auto and set the aperture that I want. For more important works I will set the ISO and choose either the aperture or shutter that I want and basically the camera reacts faster than expected, and I'm impressed with it. Not as fast as a DSLR but faster than some would have you believe.Overall the image quality is great, even up through ISO 800. After that noise does start to appear but in most cases, if the exposure is correct it is quite acceptable, except for work that may be shown in a gallery. Also, I set the over/under dial at 2/3 underexposure for daytime use and reset it to -0- for indoor use. In addition, I set the exposure setting to Vivid for more saturated colors. I have tried the Positive film choice and to appoint I like it; similar to Kodak Ektachrome and occasionally I will use that as well.What it boils down to, is to first let the camera show what it can do and then experiment with what you think it can do and just learn what works best for your needs. If you want DSLR quality then buy a DSLR but if you want a camera that will give you great images, is fairly fast and, once the ins and outs are learned, is easy and fun to use then the Canon G11 is the camera for you.And it makes a great street photography camera as well... :-)", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Canon G11 or S90......", "Author": "Jiunjr Feng \"Robert\"", "ReviewID": "R664HMMYEQ9ZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are way many reviews about G11 and S90, and it's the most headache thing for me to select the correct one, which I would like to spend money on walk and shoot porpose instead of carrying my Canon 30D.  After deep thinking and borrow G11 and S90 from friends to play couple days.  Yes, I like S90, which is a perfect size compact camera.  It have way more advantages and improvements.  However, G11 fits more my personal requirements.I finally choose G11.Here are reasons:1. Both G11 and S90 are based on Canon's DIGIC 4 Image Processor, so everyone feels both with the same performance.  I have to say not true.  You can check Canon 50D, which is also Canon's DIGIC 4 Image Processor, but people use Canon 50D not saying S90 the same as 50D.  The reason is all about lens.  S90 F2.0-4.9 is btter than G11 F2.8-4.5.  This is my key concern for selecting S90 instead of G11, so I took some indoor pictures with both S90 and G11.  After comparing those picture, I would say, S90 is awesome, but G11 is good enojugh because low light mode did help with Canon's DIGIC 4 Image Processor improvement.2. S90 has bigger LCD, which is 3.0\", but G11 LCD size is only 2.8\".  3.0\" LCD is bigger, but I want to take my picture on my self for fun sometimes, so G11 LCD is cool on it as my very very old PRO70 (Canon first semi-SLR in 1998).  I would say that I am happy to have such adjustable LCD again.3. G11 Quick Shoot Mode, which S90 not provided, is the key feature for me to select G11.  It does help a lot to catch those pictures when my son is kicking soccer or doing other excersises.  Even this mode is a battery drinker because it keep the camera nonstop focus on target, I have to prepare another backup battery.4. Shutter Speed.  G11 has Auto (1 - 1/4000 sec) and S90 only has Auto (1 - 1/1600 sec).  It's another key for me to choose it because my kids won't stand there for letting me to take their cute pictures.  They are moving around everywhere unstoppable.5. Closest Focus,  G11 is 1cm, and S90 is 5cm.  I would say G11 better on it due to my job related to electronic design.  Many components are way smaller than usual.6. G11 has optical view finder.  It's not a key concern, but I just like it since I used many digital and tranditional cameras with optical view finder most of time from 8 years old and already get use into it.  It's just a personal reason that my eyes don't like digital view finder.I would say G11 is a camera with most required functions as I expected.  S90 is also a good camera.  It really depends on your purpose and expecting of the camera.  If it's just a street camera with few club or at home indoor low light picture without flash casually, S90 is good enough for it and way better than pervious Canon S, SD, or A products.

I took the G9 to Italy over the summer, and it was great, but the initial start up and the lag time between taking pictures longer than I would have liked, even on a full battery.

It is easy to use, takes beautiful photographs at very high resolution, and has just about any feature you would want unless you're looking for a point-and-shoot with HD video capability.The large, bright LCD screen swivels out and around so you can bend over to shoot a ground shot, fold it back into the camera for hand-held, and most importantly fold it up when finished shooting to protect the screen. It has nice selection dials on top to adjust ISO, exposure, and shooting modes quickly by hand rather than fishing through menus. The menus are well organized and have easy to read letters and icons. It took only about 20 minutes to explore it all and get the camera set up the way I wanted it.High Dynamic Range photography requires that you shoot 2 or more shots at different exposures to get a full range of detail and color in the highlights, mid-range and shadows. The G11 makes this very easy. Set the camera in Aperture priority mode, with the aperture set wider for shallow depth of field and smaller for a greater depth of field.Use a tripod. The Manfrotto Modo is literally perfect for this camera and will let you get all the way down to the ground for macro shots or up to or above eye level depending on your height; it's affordable and lightweight with a great joystick handle and bubble level built in. Any tripod will do for HDR with the G11.In the menu, select autobracketing and increase the range of the 3 shots it will take to -2, 0 and +2 exposure stops. Then, click the timer button and select a 2-second timer delay. Those two steps are key, and you have to select them again each time you turn the camera back on. Getting a 4-stop latitude with 3 exposures will give you great results for HDR. Using a 2-second timer with your tripod eliminates the need for a remote or cable release to keep the camera absolutely still when taking the 3 exposures, which it fires off automatically in autobracket mode.I shoot JPEGs at the half-resolution Large setting, which gives you big images with smaller file sizes. I know some photographers also recommend shooting RAW + JPEG for HDR, but right now I am not doing that. I expect it would give me more latitude in editing, so I may try that in the future. Right now, I use auto-white balance, which is fast and accurate. I also use Aperture priority to make sure the depth of field does not change when it's taking my 3 autobracket exposures.That's it. Now you can take your 3-shot sets back to the computer, and open them up in your HDR software to make your composite. I use Photomatix Pro, which is generally regarded as the best HDR software. [...] has a great tutorial on HDR and you can get a discount code for the software there. With Photomatix, you don't really need to use Photoshop; however, if you already own Photoshop CS2 or higher you can \"merge to HDR\" your three photos and then do tone mapping. Photomatics does all that with just two buttons, and has lots of sliders for tweaking the results. Trey Ratcliff also recommends noise reduction software after tone mapping an HDR; I haven't gotten that yet, but with the right tweaking you might not need it.The G11 has a bunch of presets for different shooting conditions. I have never seen a camera with modes like \"Aquarium,\" \"Fireworks,\" and \"Underwater\" but the G11 has them. It shoots SD video, but it's higher resolution than most SD video I have seen. Not HD, but close. It has many of the features of a DSLR, but costs much less than a DSLR with comparable features. I debated getting this or the Nikon D40, but went with the Canon G11 because it has autobracketing, which the D40 does not.The smaller, lighter Canon Powershot S90 is $100 cheaper than the G11, has an actual control ring around the lens, and is a lot more low profile, but has all the same features except an actual viewfinder and no swivel LCD. It's easier to carry around, but seems like it would be just a little harder to use because it has a pop-up flash where you would want to hold it with your left hand, and the other option is to hold it with your thumb over part of the LCD screen. Also, without the swivel LCD, it's harder to get low or ground shots or over-the-head shots. That said, it's the same camera basically as the G11, and that includes the DIGIC 4 processor, which is the same used by the $2,700 Canon 5D Mark II. The G11 and S90 also use CCD sensor chips, which are a little better than most CMOS chips, and with the DIGIC 4 processor you get better low-light performance out of them.For a more all-inclusive review of the G11, I recommend Ken Rockwell's excellent website, where he has reviews on just about every camera and lens Nikon or Canon have made plus many others.To sum up, I am very satisfied with my G11 Powershot. It is a suitable DSLR replacement for most photography opportunities, and produces great results for HDR compositions.

It has preselected focus options, or make it AUTO and it can detect the focus mode. I must admit G11 does not make the best choice always, but it is satisfactory for me. Secondly, if you are not happy with G11 decisions, you make your owns and use P, Tv, Av, M. Its Bright 2.8-inch Vari-Angle PureColor System LCD enables you to take overhead pictures, I mean you can take your kids' pictures at the birthday so easily, among the cheerful kids around them.

I primarily use a point and shoot Canon SD600.  I have tons of friends and family who shoots with SLRs and I finally realized the huge difference in image quality, I wanted to upgrade with a better camera but I didn't want a complex/bulky/expensive SLR.  G11 was one of the recommendations we got, it suppose to be somewhere in between.  I'm still learning a lot about this camera but here's what I have observed from an amateur point of view.Pros:1.  Images are crisp (in my opinion).  Tried several settings in dark/bright areas, inside and outside.2.  Takes clear pics even at max zoom.3.  Easy to change settings (once you read the manual).4.  LCD which can be flipped.5.  It has tons of built in settings which you can choose, good for those who don't want to manually adjust settings for themselves.6.  Has Manual adjustment options as well.  (A lot which I still need to study).  Even for an amateur, playing around with these settings is easy.  Get's me more into photography than what I signed up for but I consider this as a plus.7.  Flash is powerful, tried variety of dark/bright but shadowy settings and flash is sufficient.  External flash, don't need it so far but nice to know I have options.8.  A lot of hint's/help text built in the camera, it helps me navigate/pick settings easier.9.  Size and weight is about right for me (I did prior research).  Not something you put in you pocket but still good.  I look like a tourist but it hangs comfortably around my neck when in use.  Not too much bother to carry around in a backpack with the right camera case.10.  Battery life is great.  Have used it several times for an entire day and battery did not run out of juice.  Battery recharge time is fast as well.Cons:1.  The dial on the right hand side sometimes unintentionally moves while holding the camera to take a shot.  Buttons in the same area unintentionally gets pressed as well.  When this happens, it makes you miss an opportunity to take a shot.Overall I'm pretty happy with this camera, a definite step up (actually a couple of step up) from SD600.

It bridges the gap between the tiny SD600 and the heavy Nikon SLR.  I just returned from a one week vacation trip during which I took over 500 photos with the G11.  The picture quality results just blew me away!  I found my pictures needed very little \"tweaking\" (editing) and that they permitted cropping and enlarging with no problems.  Most shots were taken at ISO 200 or less, so I have not yet put the camera into low light situations and cannot comment on its high ISO performance.  The menu system offers an amazing array of options and choices.  I recommend studying it and learning all its features before starting to use the camera.  I also found that I can use my SLR's external flash units on the G11 (in manual mode).  Bottom line here is that the G11 has surprised me with how well it performed.

Hey, what are friends for? When I went to replace it, I found that the G10 was no longer readily available and my friend, a Canon rep, said that the image quality with the G11 (despite the drop in pixel count) was actually better. Hmmm, better image quality than a G10 - count me in!The G11 handles like a professional instrument. There is a serious, rugged quality to it. It isn't heavy, just solid. The controls are similar to the G10 so I didn't have to crack the manual to start taking pictures. I love the way the lens retracts into the body - covering and protecting the lens when it sits in a camera bag or coat pocket. The traditional viewfinder only shows a fraction of the actual image (my guess - 70-80%) so for critical compositions, I use the fold-out screen. For anyone used to shooting with a video camera, swinging out the screen and making pictures will seem second nature. I tilt it to minimize reflections in bright sun and rarely peek through the viewfinder. Also, the ability to fold it with the screen facing forward protects it from damage in transport - I love this... It is something I liked about the G5 and missed on the G10.The zoom range is adequate for most casual shooting situations with a thumbs up for the 28mm lens effective angle of view at the wide end - perfect for family group shots and a welcome feature in a Point and Shoot.There are more features than most people will have a need for but if the shooter has pro-leanings, this camera can make some amazing images. Even if you never dig deeply into the manual to find them all, things like the image stabilization will be there and automatically help improve your pictures - maybe your best pictures ever!The reason Canon gives for going to 10 megapixels is to improve image quality by reducing noise at higher ISO settings. I rarely use an ISO above 200 so I wasn't expecting to benefit from that change but I tried shooting at ISO 800 (not recommended for big prints from the G10) and found the images quite good.The real benefit to a camera like this is the ability to shoot JPG, RAW, and RAW and JPG images at the same time. The quality of these RAW images is truly top notch. You could, if you were a pro, sell the shots, they are so sharp and the colors so true. Speaking of colors, the white balance technology built in is top notch. I leave it set on automatic and have gotten excellent color in difficult, mixed fluorescent lighting.So, the verdict is in for me. This is a great camera and a good evolution up from the G10. I recommend it for anyone who just wants a \"good\" camera and doesn't want to have to become a camera expert to use it - you can set it for AUTO and simply frame your shot and push the button (i.e., point and shoot). For the more photographically adept, you can just about do it all with the G11. RAW, manual focus and exposure, video clips, it's all there and it's all good.If anyone wants to buy this one, I may not agree to let it go.", "Date": "March 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "IT IS ALL ABOUT PICTURE QUALITY", "Author": "CAMPJEEP", "ReviewID": "R2XQJVY7HPZ0XO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Out of all my canon point and shoot cameras I will choose the G11 if it is a important picture and I have to get it right.

I never thought a compact point and shoot camera could produce such great photos.I am getting about 400 to 450 pictures per charge, ( A nice backup battery is a power2000 for canon NB-7L ( 1500 mAh )$19.00 ).

This is just me but it seams to speed up your flash shots alot. Note - (I use energizer ultimate lithium batterys in my speedlite 270).The G11 just has a good heft and feel to it, this is not a lite or little camera by no means.

I wanted something less obtrusive for people pictures, and something portable to \"grab and go.\" Enter the G11.Overall, I like it; it is much more portable than a DSLR, though for someone who is used to more diminutive point and shoots, it may seem bulky. To me if feels light (almost too light), and it's compactness makes the controls feel a little cramped. But it does look pretty cool, and feels pretty sturdy.I like the \"analog\" dials, with easy access to most of the features I use frequently. One of my favorite surprises was the ability to set the timer for face recognition -- a 2 second count down starts when a face enters the view.It won't replace my 40D -- but I didn't expect it to. I knew it would have some limitations; for me, these include a slight shutter lag when pressing the shutter, compared to the 40D (but not as bad as the S3), and a slow burst rate (a little less than 1 a shot per second). It also has too much noise at ISO 400 and up, so I will only use 200 or lower, which generally won't be a problem for me since I tend to use flash indoors.The zoom range is 5x (optical) which suits my intended purpose, but it wouldn't work if this were my only camera.

I usually shoot PROGRAM mode and manually set the ISO to get the sharpest image possible.  But the camera sets the ISO for you in all the scene modes, and it bumps up the ISO to high values (800)for flash and very early on.  It doesn't need to do this at all-- my other cheap Canon and Panasonic cameras keep the ISO at 100 or at most 200 if the flash can provide sufficient light.The solution, then, is to manually set the ISO (easy to do with the dial), but it is not possible to do this with the SCENE modes.  Now most scene modes are junk, but a few of them have some color and white balance settings that are not that easy to do yourself.  So, an extremely irrational decision on the manufacturer's part; make it easy to control ISO, take away that control for scene modes, and then pumping up the ISO (blunting the image quality) in those modes.Revised August 2011.  The camera programming has either malfunctioned or I am now aware of how bad AUTO mode is.  I have also read bad comments on review sites.  Indoors the AUTO function is unusable.  It sets the ISO at 800 and uses extremely slow shutter speed no matter what, and the images look terrible.  The flash is perfectly strong for using ISO 100 in \"P\" mode for close in flash shots.  No reason to use 1/15 exposure.  This is really odd because in my cheaper Canon cameras AUTO mode is perfectly acceptable, and I have been impressed by the choice of ISO and exposure in cheap CANON Point and shoot.So I would say, if you are an \"AUTO\" mode shooter, this camera is unusable.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera", "Author": "Dan R.

Use has included time on a vacation trip. I agree that quality and feel of the body is a step down from the earlier metal bodies, but it is serviceable.  I had reservations about the rotating viewing screen.  It adds bulk and is potentially a weak point as regards durability.  However, it works well and overall the screen versatility is a plus.  I entirely agree with others that the picture quality is superb, particularly in low light conditions.  My biggest disappointment is the reduced options available for Photostitch as compared to the G7.  The Photostitch option is now bundled into the SCN program, instead of having a stand alone slot on the dial.  I particularly miss the the option to stitch a panorama in the vertical format.  Also, when operating the camera, it is all too easy to touch buttons inadvertently, creating an unwanted option.

Traveling with kids etc. and knowing that at some point they would want / need to take some shots the point and shoot was a must.I researched a number of models and ultimately made the G11 selection due to the advancements since the G10.  Previously, I had looked at the G10 and while I liked many of the features, the low light photo quality was a major issue for me.The G11 arrived on time and as advertised in a multibox shipment from numerous sellers.  I ordered new SD memory cards (SanDisk Extreme 8GB 30MB/s) and a new battery (MUST).  As always, thanks Amazon.The pictures immediately looked fantastic.  The few test shots around the house the day before departure had great color, very nice depth and were good and sharp.  Of course the kids favorite part was the video mode which is also very nice.Throughout the trip (to Washington DC) over a beautiful spring week, the day time photos were spectacular.  Open frame shots of monuments, close ups of the cherry blossums, wide views of the city ... All very good.  The movable screen was a terrific advantage in that pictures could be shot from overhead of crowds but still allowed visual composition adjustment.  Inside shots were also good in bright exhibits but, clearly some challenges still exist in digital photography in low light.Couple negatives / surprising ... - The ISO selector dial can be set to a specific speed but the \"Auto\" selection on the top dial will still adjust the ISO to whatever it \"wants\"  ... This was a challenge in low light exhibits when trying to still retain some quality of shot.  The automatic advancement to ISO1600 made for some pretty grainy/noisy images.  After some study, low light shots were immediately changed to a more manual mode. - Battery life was not what I expected ... Perhaps my expectations were too high but roughly 250-300 pictures was about it on a full charge (thank goodness for the spare).All in all, a great camera with a few small challenges but the quality of most shots were on par with my big SLRs when outside and were easy to work around in non-optimal point and shoot territory.

I am a fairly \"rough\" camera user in that I carry my camera on my belt in rain, snow, cold, and heat while hiking, climbing, off-trail scrambling, kayaking, etc.  The G11 is definitely the second best camera I have ever owned (OK, here is the scale, I shot with a Mamiya 7 for several years and out of nostalgia it will always be my \"favorite\" camera).  The G11 is a great compromise between durability, useability, and creative flexibility.In my mind, the G11 really stands out for the following reasons:1)  Great picture quality when shooting in the program mode2)  Most of the key features I use are one button away (as opposed to several menus down).  This includes flash control. self timer (for when I put the camera on a Gorilla pod), +/- exposure, ASA, macro, etc.3)  Battery life (I am amazed at how long the battery lasts, I had intended to buy a second battery but do not need it.  I did not need a recharge after 300 photos over two months and recently ran it dry after 200 photos, 30 minutes of video, and probably 30-45 minutes of screen review time.  The screen was on throughout.4)  Large, clear screen.  This is beautiful and I feel spoiled.  I did put a screen protector on it (if you do, get a GPS one.  The first one I tried, for a PDA, resulted in some strange polarization issues but the GPS one works great.5)  Key creative features such as the ability to move the focus/exposure frame, flash power, full manual, etc.One key disadvantage of the G11 (like most reflex cameras) is the complication in using filters.  I am trying an aftermarket device for filters and it works, but is a bit cumbersome.I have a little camera bag that fits on my belt and the G11 tucks away nicely.  I wore it full time for over a week with little or no interference.  One nice bonus, I did not expect, on the G11 is the outstanding video it takes.  It shoots in .mov and does a nice 720x480.  I have stopped carrying a flip camera and find myself taking more video because it is so convenient.

I was trying to decide between a PnS and an entry dSLR and decided that the G11 was the perfect blend between the two. A significant part of the reason I decided on the G11 was the improved low-light capture quality and that Canon returned to the articulating LCD. Taking RAW and large smooth edge JPG files, at the same time, is a significant feature that few other PnS and many entry level dSLR cameras don't even have.The G11 has all the creative control of a dSLR and ease of use expected from a PnS. I love being able to adjust the aperture (Av), shutter speed (Tv), ISO and exposure for when I want/need to be creative/controlling and the next use have a full range of PnS presets for capturing memories with family and friends; without having a big, bulky and obtrusive dSLR get in the way of a candid moment.My only wish for the G11 were that the lens were capable of f2.0, but since most dSLR lenses aren't capable of that, it seems like an extreme wish.Note: about a week after getting my G11 I noticed a 2x2 pixel white spot, with a 8x6 noisy rosette around it.

If you wear glasses you can adjust the viewfinder correction for your eyesight without glasses. Not many point and shoot cameras have this feature.  It is what I would call a medium size camera.  It will fit into your coat pocket but not you shirt pocket.  If you are not much into photography just put it in the Auto Mode and forget the rest.  It will be difficult to make a bad picture.  The swivel LCD makes it easy to shoot pictures of yourself or other pictures at difficult angles.  It comes with a neck strap but I would suggest a $3 wrist strap.  I cannot find anything I do not like other than I wish it was a bit smaller but then I would lose many of the features that make this a great camera. The movie feature is simple and easy to shoot. I first hooked it up to my Mac PowerBook and my pictures were immediately displayed and available for transfer to the computer even without installing the software that comes with it.

Junqueira", "ReviewID": "R1JBM649FNYOHV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've agonized about which compact camera to buy, the G11 or the S90 for a couple of weeks. In the end I bought the S90 and some of the reviews really helped me, so here's my contribution to the people making that decision today:Do you own a DSLR? Definitely go with the S90.Are you looking for a camera to take in your pocket? No doubt about it, go with the S90. I've used the G10 and G11 and, believe me, there's NO WAY you are taking them in your pocket!The big differences between the two, which I'm fairly sure you all know by now are:- The focal length (105mm for the S90 and 140mm for the G11)- The manual controls- The size- The hot-shoe (only the G's have them)- The flashWell, let me start by addressing one of the main complaints I've been reading about, the fact that the rear wheel is \"loose\"and that you can change your definitions without noticing it. It was a concern when I bought the camera and, to my surprise, it has NEVER been an issue while shooting. I don't have small hands and I don't know how other people hold a compact camera, but for it works like clockwork, no problem whatsoever. I even dare to say that if it was a bit harder to move it, it might take from the easiness of changing your controls before shooting the picture.The difference in focal length doesn't bother me. Would it be nice to have more on the S90? Yeah, sure. But is it a concern? No, not for me. I'm strictly against using the digital zoom, but on the few times I tried just to see the result, I confess I was a bit surprised (on the good side) by it.The manual controls are exceptional, the combination of frontal ring, back ring and shortcut button make it easy to change configurations and control the camera. And for those of you wondering about the speed in doing it, I can say that I've been taking pictures to make a book about the life guard service here and it's all about speed. Sometimes I take the S90 to the beach instead of the big DSLR's because people won't even notice me taking pictures with it, and the DSLR's always cause a fuss, specially when people are being rescued and are ashamed to be seen in that light...As for the size, I bought it to have a everyday camera always with me and this is the perfect one for this. A couple of friends decided to buy one after seeing mine (one of them is abandoning his G10 for it). And I was very, very pleasantly surprised by the image quality and camera quality I got with the S90, I never regretted choosing it and now, after having handled a G10 and a G11, I think I would be mad with me if I had chosen the G11 instead of the S90.Some reviewers have questioned the built quality of the S90, but I don't have any complaints about it, and it has been living in my pocket for over a month now, receiving some fairly rough treatment sometimes. As for the shutter release on the S90, yes, it is in a bit awkward position to be sure, but after one or two days with the camera you'll adjust to it. Is it a serious problem? Not even close!Regarding the hot-shoe and flash: well, I own two DSLR's, so if I want to put a big flash on top of the camera, I'll take the big one. It might be different for people who are buying this as their only camera. I hate flash and avoid using it always, even bumping the ISO to the moon, but, on the occasion I used the in-camera flash I was amazed by it's power.When I'm shooting \"professionally\" I tend to go with the RAW + JPEG mode, but sometimes I prefer to use the strict JPEG mode and it has a very interesting color control that helps eliminate the need for working the files later on. Anyway, you can change that configuration in about 2 to 3 seconds if you need to (the RAW/JPEG, because the colors are even faster).A lot of reviewers and photographers talk about the S90 exceptional AutoWhite Balance, but I don't really like it, I tend to prefer choosing presets all the time (I don't like the auto WB in my NIkon's DSLR's either), but that is also very easy and fast to do in this camera.Well, that's about it. I'm sure there are other reviews discussing the technical details more deeply, but I've been a VERY HAPPY S90 owner for the past month or so and I'm sure glad that I chose the S90 instead of the G11. To tell you the truth, I don't see much reason in buying the G11, as it is not a compact camera, it is not a DSLR, it is not lightweight, so it's a middle everything. But the S90, and I've been hearing the same opinion from others for the past weeks, seems like the queen of compacts for now (I hope the manufacturers start a \"fully manual compact\" cameras war now).I believe that, for most buyers, the S90 will always be the smart choice!", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "I like it a lot", "Author": "Stivo", "ReviewID": "R2Q5QQN6OJOT2S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'd wanted a Canon G series since the G9, and my wife finally let me buy one.

Yet, I have been involved in photography for over 30 years ever since I was in middle school. I have owned mostly Nikon cameras up to F4s, then I switched to digital with Nikon D70 as soon as it became available, and then D300 about two years ago...I have owned Canon G3 about 6-7 years ago. I immediately fell in love with its articulated LCD. Why? I found it is very useful to take a shoot from different view angles that will make your picture more attractive. And particularly useful if you have just had a small child that starts to claw across your living room floor.As most of us here, I shop for G11 as a camera that I can take it everyday and everywhere. In my mind it is perfect for that purpose. I bought it as a \"tool for photography\", so I am not bothered too much for its weight and size. For this G11, what I like the most is that it is extremely easy adjusting almost all important parameters for taking a good photo, such as ISO, shooting mold, exposure compositions, exposure lock. After I get the color balance stored in the short-cut button on the left side of the camera, everything is at my fingertips.  I can not found what else I would ever missed. If that is not enough, it provides C1 and C2, to store two customer-settings of your preference.Of course, it could be better. For those who expect to use G11 for shooting their kid involving in-door sports game or stage performance, they could be disappointed a little. I think it does not focus fast enough, and can only take about one frame per second. OK.

There should be some sort of lock on it to keep it on the correct setting. Another down side, for me, is the battery. I have always had and preferred to have camera that took double A batteries. This the first camera I have had with a specific battery and a plug in charger. I am not thrilled about that but the thing came as a package so what do you do?Another point I would make is the shutter release should stick up more so when it is pressed one can avoid camera movement while taking a picture. The way it is now, one has to be real careful when taking the picture to push only the shutter release and NOT the whole camera.I have not tried to take action shots so I can't say how well it reacts to that. I hope it does well or I will have to bracket my shots in the hope of getting a good one.Overall, I like the camera and plan to keep it.And I would agree this camera is about as close as you can get to a DSLR without actually getting one.", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Inge Santoso \"Learn and Grow!\"", "ReviewID": "R1M2UOLM0XFBD8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Canon G9 died on me during a trip to Egypt, so I bought G11 as a replacement.

The vari-angle allows a full view of the subject without having to contort in awkward positions.I have an online business (personalized magnets and labels); with over 1200 products. I needed a camera that was convenient, easy to understand and pretty much automatic; and at the same time, was capable of producing clear, crisp closeups that captured the fine details of small print. This Canon performed every time with superb quality. I would not trade it for any other camera.The only small disadvantage is the manual is so small and the print is very hard to read.

Butterfield", "ReviewID": "R17SRJBRCN1BAY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an excellent serious amateur camera with one major flaw.  Attaching a filter, such as a polarizer, to the lens is a pain. I purchased a non-Canon brand adapter to attach the filter to the camera body because the Canon was plastic and the non-Canon was metal.I do mostly outdoor photography so I use a polarizer frequently, a split ND now and then and a 6 stop ND for some long exposure  water shots occasionally. Attaching filters is important to me, but apparently not to Canon.First you have to remove a lens ring outside the lend barrel on the G11. Be careful as it is easy to loose.If you want to use the polarizer with wide angle view you attach the first tube to the body and then screw on the filter. If you try to zoom out to 140mm the lens hits the inside back of the polarizer and the camera shuts down.  So, to use the polarizer with anywhere near the 140mm length you have to unscrew the filter, screw in the second extension tube to the first and then attach the filter to the end of the second tube.  Now if you want to zoom back to wide angle you get serious vignetting.The 2 tubes I have measure, when combined into 1 tube for telephoto use, 2 \u00bc long by 2 3/8 diameter. That takes up too much space.I shoot HDR and to try and hand hold a filter on the front of the lens just causes too much camera movement. So that is not an option for me.Canon really needs to design a removable step-up ring that attaches to the front of the lens.I really hope that Canon will solve this problem before they produce the G12.  It is my only complaint, but it is a major one.What I love most about the camera:  the articulated screen, RAW format, size and overall image quality.

I think this is a very worthy successor to the line. After a month of ownership, about 750 pictures and thousands of miles travelled with it, I can report that I am very pleased with it. My primary needs for this camera are something compact that I can throw in a carry on bag for travel or something that I can conveniently grab at home for a party or for Internet images. It must have excellent image quality, offer advanced features and controls and accept an external flash. The G11 meets all of these requirements and offers a few bonus features such as a built in ND filter, very good video (but non-HD which I don't care about) and a superb swivel display.I find camera operation very straightforward and I really appreciate the abundance of dials for ISO, Exposure Compensation, Modes and more. For me, it feels faster than software menus and is easily double checked visually. Power up is fast as is autofocus and I have rarely found myself waiting for the camera to catch up to me. This makes it well suited for travel or child photography where you must seize the moment. The lens range is excellent, particularly the wide end of 28 mm which again is very useful for travel where you may be shooting in tight interiors or trying to capture groups of people or large vistas. As with all lenses of this type, there is noticeable barrel distortion at the wide end which is correctable in post processing. Shooting small product images for auctions or sharing on the Internet is easy with the macro mode and the swiveling screen. The flash does a fair job of throttling down for close range. Macro shots might work better with a bounced external flash such as the 270EX though. Speaking of the 270EX, it makes a perfect mate for this camera because it is so small but still offers bounce capability. I am able to squeeze it into the Tamrac travel case that I use for the camera.The creative possibilities with the G11 are tremendous since output is really very good and the artistic control and features are so comprehensive. Kudos to Canon for the brave move of downsizing the megapixel count and focusing on image quality. The improvement in ISOs above 80 is very significant - I used it repeatedly at ISO 400 on a recent trip. With my old G9 I would not have considered using this setting because of the cost in image noise and quality. Battery life in my experience is very good and reliability overall for the camera looks promising since I used it in rain, sub-zero and hot temperatures without a hitch.If there are any drawbacks to the camera for me, they are that the controls are a little crowded for my average male hands and the multipurpose rotary dial on the back could use improvement, it is too cramped and spins too easily.

After all the photos I have taken with this camera, there is only two things I can see needs to be improved. First, when you go into the movie mode the ring tends to move to a position other than what you selected before. You need to check this before every shot. The other is that there is no bulb selection. Fifteen seconds is the max you can use. I know it's rare you would need this, but, I would have liked this.Other than that I think the camera is the best I've owned.

The first 2mp one I had took the best pictures of everything I shot (except macro), the last one I had was the A650 12mp camera and it was the best overall but getting kind of beat up so I sprung for the G11. Dont believe the other reviewers, this camera takes horrible pictures. The battery life is also bad. I took it out the first full day on vacation with a newly charged battery and after a few hours of off and on shooting the battery died. This happened a few days in a row with different batteries. I was expecting better quality pictures even with the lower resolution but better processor but I was sadly mistaken. The A650 which Canon discontinued for some unknown reason pictures were sharper and took better low light pictures by far. I have not experimented with the non auto settings much except the low light setting which knocks the image size to 1824x1368 which is unacceptable to me. The camera feels solid and looks nice and has the swing away LCD, but that is really not as important as picture quality. I am very bummed out and wish I could get my money back..............  I still cannot believe the first Canon I ever had took excellent pictures of EVERYTHING!!  Not sure what they were thinking of but somehow their RD decided to make higher mp cameras over the years with successively lower picture quality, which is a mystery to me.

But I have to say that Canon just skimped too much trying to maintain its presence in the category. Understandably, the yen has appreciated considerably against the US dollar so they had to cut down on giving us the features we would have liked (24mm equivalent wide angle lens and a bigger zoom perhaps), but I could have lived without it if it weren't for the awkward weight balance and the thin grip (at least, for my hands which are not big by any means but also not small). The pictures that it takes are very nice. I am not a professional though, so I am looking for something that is relatively easy to carry around and that doesn't require too much hassle to put on the polarizing filter I have come to demand for my work. Canon should have given the way the lens extends and how that impacts the extension tube setup a lot more thought. And yet, I could have lived with that too, but this is no small camera and it weighs my bag down like a brick.

Here's my 1st video review of a product on amazon.com. If you don't know me at all I'm actually very present on the internet. My name is bboyspaz ([...]) But as I explained in the video, I'm not a photographer but the Canon Powershot G11 really did its job and is totally awesome. So check out the review!!Canon PowerShot G11 10MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide Angle Optical Stabilized Zoom and 2.8-inch articulating LCD", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Well I'm spoiled", "Author": "T. Danner \"TJ\"", "ReviewID": "RV6TT9GNMZX44", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that my main camera is a 5D mkII and I love it. I bought this as a always have with me kind of camera. I think it takes pretty good photos sometimes, but you have to get a lot of settings right for that to happen. I have taken some really good macro shots of flowers but most of the landscape shots are not keepers.I like the zoom range.But the problems I have with it are:Noise, unless you use ISO 400 or lower. Auto ISO gave some really bad noise.When I pick up or hold the camera, my thumb, and I have small hands, is on top of about 4 buttons, which are easily pressed. Which you then have to reset.The only problem I have with the features is that there are really a lot of them and they don't work if you take RAW shots. I realize that's because with RAW you've got it all right there. But that means that if I'm shooting in a difficult environment, I have to make all the settings myself. Not always easy to get the best shot.", "Date": "November 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Returned - broken", "Author": "P. Vinall", "ReviewID": "R4ACP5NDYDNUM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was so excited to try this camera, but three days later it went back.  The LCD stopped working.My background includes extensive photography with film.  I tried digital with a Canon S50 starting in 2003.  This got me hooked on a smaller camera size and I thought the G11 would be the perfect compromise- SLR features in a more compact size.Pros:- Low light picture quality- Pro features - hot shoe, manual exposure controls, RAW format, view finder- Dials for exposure compensation, ISO- Articulating LCD (until it broke)- 5x optical zoomCons:- Cheap construction - particularly the LCD- It seemed to switch to Macro for no reason and I'd have to change the mode to get out of itMy Minolta SLR and Canon S50 felt very solid.  I traveled and did outside activities without much fear of breaking the cameras.  The G11 feels delicate.  And the poor LCD stopped working in less than a week.  Not sure if it is a design or manufacturing issue, but I'm going to wait for the next upgrade before looking at the G series again.  Instead, I'm thinking of a Canon S90 or perhaps a Nikon SLR.  Or perhaps I'll just stick with my Canon S50.", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Obsolete At Birth", "Author": "budwzr \"budwzr\"", "ReviewID": "RR2HHUNYKZB7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The G7 was the camera that started the revolution against big bulky DSLR's, and ate into their marketspace by attracting the prosumer photographers. Canon had a real HIT!So what did Canon do? They released three more generations of G series with NO HD VIDEO!That's why I bought a Lumix fz-35, and then I found out that Lumix is a better match for the manual shooter like me, because all the manual controls are right up front, and Canon wants you to use their Digic chip, that's why they took raw out of the G7, but had to put it back in due to customer uproar.Canon wants their camera (Digic Chip) to get the credit for great shots, not the photographers. They're very haughty and arrogant now. It feels like they're trying to dictate the photography market instead of making cameras that customers really want.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointed!", "Author": "Muhammad N. Islam", "ReviewID": "R223ICZBU4YSFL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am disappointed to say the least with the performance of the new and much ballyhooed Canon PowerShot G11. I am a little guy and I was getting tired of carrying my Nikon D90 around my neck and wanted to get a compact yet versatile performer. I pinned my hopes on Canon PowerShot G11 to give me the satisfaction and sorry to say that my hopes and expectations have been dashed. I received my G11 yesterday along with a nifty small Canon Speedlite 270EX flash. Both items appear to be very well made with a small but not too small size and weight -- nearly perfect everywhere companion camera. With great expectations and enthusiasm I charged the battery, put in a SanDisk Ultra SD card in the designated slot of the camera set out to take some indoor and outdoor (brightly lit by sun light)test shots using both ambient light source as well as using the camera mounted flash. Oh yes, I used mostly AUTO setting to snap the shots. Rushed to download the shots to check the results on my computer using the newest version of Photoshop Elements. These test shots are not exhaustive by any means but they give me enough indications that Canon has failed in it's mission to produce a quality camera. I have listed below some of my observations:1. Pictures do not appear sharp.2. AWB is poor with yellow overtone indoors and blueish outdoors.3. There is a magenta fringe at the outline of the subjects (house and tree-trunks -- for lac of immediately available and suitable subjects).I must admit the flex LCD screen is a delight. The handling of the camera is nearly perfect in my smallish hands. Available features on the camera is plentiful. Canon may as well get rid of the view-finder from the future G series cameras unless of course they improve it substantially.No matter how beautiful the camera looks and feels in our hands, pity it is still a dud. And I am sure many other owner-users will agree with me. I shall be most hesitant to recommend this camera to any of my friends and reserve the recommendations for you know who!", "Date": "October 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Arrived broken", "Author": "Shahama", "ReviewID": "R3ESVBVWXSH6XG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The product arrived broken and unusable.

However, there are few noticeable benefits. We appreciate the new variangle (swivel) LCD with viewfinder, and improved automatic shooting feature of the device itself.Most importantly, Canon's G-Series offer excellent photographic capability.", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002LITT56"}}
