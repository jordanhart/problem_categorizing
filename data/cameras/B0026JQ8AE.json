{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent pictures, major drawbacks", "Author": "Michaela", "ReviewID": "R3V1YI0C8NOQ4Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm no photography expert -- strictly point and click. This is my first digital camera. I'm pretty computer literate but know a very little bit about manipulating digital photos using very basic programs -- mostly I know how to fix color balance, crop and resize. From my very amateur perspective: the photos are excellent, I love the video capability, and the automated functions (zoom, light level, etc) work very well.There are 2 major drawbacks to this camera, though: there is no direct viewer, so you can only use the LCD display, which is very hard to see in daylight. And there's a huge lag time between photos -- it takes several seconds for the camera to reset itself to take a photo, unless you use a feature that I never remember to turn on until afterwards. There's also a long lag between the time you press the button to take the photo, and the time the photo is actually taken. Very frustrating if you're trying to catch those moments-that-occur-in-a-split-second.The zoom is great, but you MUST have a tripod to use it to fullest advantage -- it's a very long exposure. I don't like the EasyShare digital editing program at all, and use PaintShop Pro instead. I got an LCD cover/shade for the display -- protects it, and makes it easier to use in direct sunlight.Wouldn't buy it again, but it was a good starter digital camera (I got it at a terrific price from a redbrick store -- much less than what it's being sold for here) and now I know what to look for next time.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "\"It's a love-hate thing\"", "Author": "P. BENNETT", "ReviewID": "R2RKX0FY7RIIOX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My first introduction to this camera was through my wife's uncle. He walked in with a shiny black camera stuck onto a walking stick, and he looked like some cyberpunk out for some birding. He tipped the viewing screen towards me and zoomed in on a shot of his grand-daughter playing softball. She was in the act of swinging her bat and the ball hung motionless in space before her like a fat toad. He winked at me and said, \"99 bucks!\"I had to have it. Amazon had it, of course, and it was the best deal in town. I awaited its arrival with great anticipation.When I charged it up and charged out the door, I was immediately struck by the amazing power of its zoom. This camera has the best zoom I have ever used outside of an expensive SLR. I was focusing in on things miles away, and the photos came out clear as a bell. The 'auto' setting is clever enough to take great photos under almost all circumstances. It's light, and yet large enough to hold comfortably.It wasn't without its problems, of course. It wouldn't start up when I wanted it to (it has a sliding start button which brings to mind cranking up a Model-T), and it doesn't shut down when I expect it to. It frequently shifts into a twilight zone where it won't take photos and neither will it turn off completely. There is no low battery warning, and so my first inking of power trouble is when it flips into \"Kodak Share\" mode and then shuts off.However, I was willing to trade all these negatives for great photos. Over time I have explored the other camera settings, and become aquainted with their faults. The macro setting in particular is weak: I had gotten used to the spectacular closeups available from my Canon, and this Kodak is a very poor substitute. The flash is a mixed bag; it is so bad, with so many random effects (like slow sync), that it actually takes some great shots - albeit accidentally. But hey, a good photo is a good photo.Finally, it has impressed me with its durability. When I knocked it into a pond and fished it out 5 minutes later, I figured it was gone forever. It was with mixed feelings that I took out the battery and left it on the shelf to dry. Weeks later, I reinserted the same battery, cranked it - and it miraculously came to life. My old Canon would never have survived that dunking.In the end, when the zoom knob fell off and I was left with a spectacular lens I could no longer zoom, I had to face the question: replace the Kodak, or buy a different camera. I did both. I bought a compact camera that bores me with its mediocre performance, and then I went and got me another Kodak ZD8612. With all its faults, with all the missed shots because it would not turn on, with all the software irritations, it still takes some great photos. And isn't that what a camera is for?", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "i really like the camera.", "Author": "Digit", "ReviewID": "R2BB9RWDK1QI2Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "compared to my samsung 8.1 megapixel picture camera , i like this one way better...i use regular AA batteries ... i thought i needed a special battery but found out i don't.this camera takes the best looking natural pictures out of any of the camera's i have had... which is not many.my experience is that any time flash is applied it causes un-natural glare... so i try not to use it when possible on any of my camera's , and i really like the  ISO mode on this camera... i can take pictures in low light and still get a good picture.i also like the make... it holds steady in my hand.personal opinion: a tripod is a good thing with any high zoom camera.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "All cameras have their pros and cons...this one is no exception", "Author": "John Janaro", "ReviewID": "R3TJS34VCQ5RQ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before you read this review, I must warn you that I am only 14 years old (I am writing on behalf of my dad).  Keep that in mind as you read this.  I make no claim to be a photography expert.  My dad and I bought this 2008 model at a local flea market for 40 dollars.  The former owners made no complaints about it and it seemed to be a good camera.  This is the second camera that I have had, although I have seen and worked with many others.  There are many pros and cons to this camera.  I'll start with the pros.1. The zoom on this camera is phenomenal (12x).  I wouldn't bother with the digital zoom.2. There is little delay between pushing the shutter button and taking the picture.3. It is constantly focusing and refocusing and if you have a stable hand you can get an extremely clear picture.4. The lens is so large that the flash is not necessary for any setting (I haven't used it since day 1).5. It has several specialized settings for particular scenes such as snow, sunset, beach, stage, mountains, etc.  It has 2 timer settings one for 2 seconds and one for 10 seconds.6. It has a gripper on the right side for easy handling as well as a strap.7. Though it is big it is light for its size.8. I fully agree with what another reviewer said about its durability.  It has withstood many drops and crashes and even a slap shot at it.9. Since it does not need to use the flash the batteries (I use AA rechargeable batteries) last a considerable amount of time.  I would recommend getting about 8 rechargeable batteries and a charger and use those.10. Though it only takes 8 MP pictures, they are very good, in fact just as good as the standard 14 MP picture.  As a result of this, it holds more pictures on it.11. The videos it takes are good as well but the sound quality is not particularly excellent.12. Since I bought it at a flea market, I did not get all the accessories with it.  I have not seen how the \"easy share\" feature works on this camera.  I will leave this feature for the other reviewers.Now for the cons.1. Many of the pictures it takes are blurry.  A few of them are not just a little blurry, but extremely blurry.  One could almost describe this camera as having \"moods\".  It can take amazingly clear pictures and sometimes can take amazingly blurry pictures.2. The editing features on the camera are not even worth considering.  Don't waste time and battery on these features.3. Many video players on computers cannot play its videos.  It needs Quicktime (a version from at least 2008).  Quicktime comes with the software but if you have Windows XP service pack 1 you are out of luck.  Service pack 3 will work.  (SP 2 I am not sure about).4. Some of its indoor pictures have a weird yellowish light color to them.  Sometimes the angle of the lens can fix this.  It might be because of my non-use of the flash.  From the few flash pictures that I did take indoors, I was not pleased.  Everyone looks like pale faced zombies.5. There is a 3 second delay between pictures.6. As another reviewer said, there is no low-battery warning.  The camera might turn off without notice, or when you turn it on it might not respond.  In this respect it is very easy to get mad at this camera.7. As mentioned above, the sound quality of the videos is mediocre.8. The lens is so big that sometimes it can take in too much light.9. There is no lens cover, however, the lens is made of strong glass and doesn't necessarily need one.10. It is too big to fit in a pocket and so you will have to carry it in a case, on the strap around your neck, or in your hand.There may be more pros and cons that I am forgetting but that is the vast majority of them.  To sum up this camera, I would say that it is wishy-washy.  It takes great pictures when it has the \"mind\" to.  I would not recommend this camera to everybody.  Some people might find the blurry pictures or the large size undesirable.  Depending on the above features it is your decision on whether this is the right camera for you.
