It's definitely entry-level, with few bells and whistles, but it takes sharp pictures. Some of the reviews I read indicated that the photos taken in low-light situations weren't the greatest, but that hasn't been my experience at all. I have taken a few pictures while out on the town with friends, and the pictures came out perfectly well. The pics I took at an outdoor wedding last week were beautiful--the bride even asked me to send them to her for her album. Overall, the camera is easy to set up and use, and takes great pictures. For the price, it's a great little camera!", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly Surprised", "Author": "AmerAussie", "ReviewID": "R3COUUIUUQB9EB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 6 year old son had been asking me for a camera for about a year, so on vacation I gave in. He told me he wanted a blue camera and pointed to this one. I'm normally a researcher, but the price on this compared to other comparable or \"better\" cameras couldn't be beat. Boy am I impressed! This camera takes better pictures than the Nikon Coolpix I bought for my husband! Honestly! I started using this camera for all of our vacation pictures and just love it. I may not give it back to him. : )What I don't like is the software that comes with it. It is slow to load, freezes and gets touchy about which photos it will let you crop. You are better off using your choice of photo editing software, although it did do a decent job enhancing some of my more distant landscape shots. Don't buy it for the software, buy it because it's a great little camera at a great price.", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "cute but complicated", "Author": "Laurencia \"Eva\"", "ReviewID": "R377GVCGVO3M76", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is the third Kodak camera I own ; this is the tiniest of all which is great; it is light and takes good pictures. The reason why I don't like it too much is that it is more complicated to use; the last small one had a small wheel on the top that made it easy to adjust it to close-ups etc. This one doesn't have that practical solution, it takes more time to find what you are looking for. Also it is more complicated a slower to transfer the pictures to your computer. I admit I am technically somewhat challenged but this is the type of camera that is supposed to be used by people like me.The price is good though and I hope it doesn't die on my too soon.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Somewhat of a basic model for Kodak", "Author": "ginmar \"book/digital addict\"", "ReviewID": "R14MJGCELHZ0KA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Kodak, after Canon, is my favorite brand of camera, due to the sturdiness of the casing and the wonderful way they have in-camera programs which other cameras require you to do on the computer. You can edit videos on the camera, clipping out frames from video, and so on. If they just added extremely high speed video, I'd be ecstatic, because I love to shoot lightning storms and then clip out the best individual frames as stills. 30 frames per second is pretty slow when it comes to lightning. But enough about me. Like all Kodaks, this is sturdy, with excellent in-camera editing features such as panorama, video editing, touching up photos, and a variety of 'scenes', which is Kodak speak for different settings for different photo ops. It is absurdly, delightfully small---smaller than my blackberry. It's smaller than a deck of cards.  It's somewhat basic in comparison to my z1485, which is basically a tiny almost-SLR. But if you want a camera to grab as you're dashing out the door, this is it. A word on Kodaks: I went to Iraq and I wound up killing two cameras, or rather the heat did, along with the rough and tumble conditions. I think the heat is what fried them, literally, because on some days, it was 100+ by 9AM---in the shade. By noon it was unspeakable.  A friend gave me a floor model, used, from a store, and that camera got kicked around, subjected to the conditions that had killed the other two cameras, the heat, the dust, and the abuse, and though by the end of the tour I had to keep the battery compartment shut with a rubber band, it still worked just fine. When I got home I upgraded to another Kodak. I gave the old one---still equipped with the rubber band----to a soldier friend, who in turn took it to Iraq with her. It came back with her in fine shape but finally back home, it gave up the ghost, yet was in good enough shape to be sold for parts on Ebay. Its successor---the much beloved V505---went to friends when I upgraded from that one, and that too performed admirably till it got fried in an electrical incident. Every Kodak I've had---and I have three now---- are tough, small, and versatile. I'm very fond of them, and all they need to do now is to make a camera that has night vision and shoots at FPS1000.  That's all I ask. Until then, I've got these in my bag when I go out the door.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great pictures in a compact size", "Author": "Lincoln Reagan \"The World is a Wonder\"", "ReviewID": "RHHPC8S247AO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera for my elementary aged daughter for her birthday. I had another Kodak, the M1033 and was happy with it. We used both on a recent trip, and when Dad (me) slippery-fingered the M1033 (larger one) and broke it, this Kodak Mini filled in admirably. My daughter took great pictures with it. It is not a \"kids\" camera, but is sized so they can used it effectively.

Excellent photos and small enough, and light enough, to put in a pants or shirt pocket and not bulge or feel heavy at all.  In fact, it's easy to not even think about the fact that I have a camera with me.  As for size, I can easily hold it in the palm of my hand.  This is the camera I want for everyday activities and where convenience matters.  I can just grab it, stuff it in a normal pocket, and go.  It's there for every candid or spur of the moment shot that I would have missed.I find this camera much more versatile, with many more features, than any cell phone camera.  And since it's so small and has so much more capability, there's every reason to take it along.  And it's certainly much easier to upload and share these photos.  The software works perfectly and is simple and straightforward.Okay, you get the idea I'm pretty happy with this purchase.  I can even take it with me on the bicycle, where normally I'm trying to get rid of every item and every bit of extra weight.

It has done a very effective job in realistically photographing wounds that I blow up on the computer to make presentations to my fellow medical professionals. I especially appreciate the fidelity in the close-up shots I take of wounds. The compact design lends itself to this task because it is easy to carry and use without being a distraction. The only caveat I have had with the Mini M200 is it feels cheap and fragile. In regular use at the hospital, not a demanding environment for a camera, the protective battery cover popped off of the hinge and refused to snap back on. I have filed a repair request with Kodak and now I have to wait and see if they will repair the camera under the warranty. Other than this battery cover issue the camera has worked very well. If it had with a little more robust design and construction I would give this camera a 5-star rating but this problem holds the rating to just 4-stars.", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super disappointing", "Author": "Sheila \"Sheila\"", "ReviewID": "R3AYS53S8WUUUE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this for my 9 year old daughter. She brought it on vacation and snapped over 400 photos.  Literally 5 were not blurry.  I realize a 9 year old wielding a camera is going to result in a less than perfect picture, so I tested it myself over several days. I took about 100 pictures and had a very difficult time getting a crisp image.  Of the total 500 combined pictures less then 10 were worthy of a 4x6 print.The battery life is horrible. The camera needs to be charged so often, it often was left behind because it wasn't ready to go.The shutter kept getting stuck open.There is no macro whatsoever. Don't even try.On the positive side, my daughter really liked the purple color. Its a little sparkly, she really thought that was cool.  The size is also really nice for little hands and to carry around.Unfortunately, we have returned this camera and are looking for something better. I'm really disappointed that we didn't try it before we left for vacation.

My only criteria was the smallest camera I could find (for around $100 or less), because she loves taking pictures when she goes out running but hates carrying lots of bulky stuff.

It's so small that handling it is almost tricky with adult-sized hands, but not too great a price to pay.She loves the clever tiny mirror on the front for self portraits.  It's all you need--don't waste extra $$ on a fancy front LCD screen. The battery life is really outstanding (even a year later), and the pictures are plenty sharp and clear enough for our needs.  The screen doesn't have any scratches on it a year later, despite doing nothing to protect it.Like other reviews have pointed out, no fancy bells and whistles here, just a solid, basic camera that gets the job done and is highly portable while doing so.

In three weeks, they took exactly (7,942) pictures, never using a case, just stufffed in a pocket.  Couple of falls from waist level to concrete or cobbles; no apparent damage.We had only one issue with any camera.  One lost the little internal retaining clip or spring that holds in the SD card, but the camera door held it engaged just fine.Charging from USB was handy off the laptop or supplied AC adapter; I hate AA or AAA batteries in cameras - they seem to last about a hundred shots.  Best day for one of these was (312) 10-MP shots with some battery left.The camera turns on very quickly - plenty of ability to whip it out as we were driving past something and get a good pic in time.The totally flat \"closed\" position makes it easy to slide in and out of a pocket or backpack strap.Pictures in decent light were great - inside a dim cathedral, the shutter speed was slow enough to blur occasionally.  The zoom is not much - 3x gets you some closer, but better to crop later in a photo-editing program.The panorama feature gave us some great shots of big vistas and cathedral ceilings - three seamlessly-stitched-together pix into one.I've got no reference to judge them from a photography standpoint - I'm just a casual picture-taker to record projects - but foor the purpose we used them for, they couldn't have performed better.<edit> - we also ordered a red one; got neon pink - not an issue for our youngest girl!", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wrong color twice!", "Author": "J.

As an inexperienced digital camera user, I didn't realize the camera itself would only hold 10 (ten) pictures!!!  I was so excited about getting the camera in time for Easter, when it failed me fast.  I fault the DESCRIPTION of the camera for this.  It might have made a difference in my decision.Most of the instructions are written with the assumption you already know how to use a digital camera.  Nothing for rank beginners like me.Overall, I really like it.  It's lightweight & small & easily carried in my purse or pocket.  It takes decent pictures, which I hope with time will improve as I gain more experience.One other thing which I don't particularly like is that the USB cord & power cord are one & the same.  To solve this problem, I bought a battery charger K7700 from Kodak, which comes with a 7006 battery, so I could have a charged battery at all times.  I don't think the K7700 advertised on Amazon comes with a battery - at least I couldn't find any description that said so.Now I've spent about $150 (my upper limit) on this camera, when I was so thrilled about finding it at $89.

The price went up after it's discontinued and it's merely 2mb photo. So, I was searching and then I found this camera coming out. I was so thrilled. I grabbed it since it was on sale. I would have paid 99 dollar cuz there is nothing like this. So, I couldn't be happier. I took some photo and the photos are better than I could ever expect. I have had kodak before. I didn't like it. I didn't like canon either. Pictures weren't that good. It was dark and it looks like they want to make the picture pretty rather than crisp and lively. This one does that. I like it a lot. It's so so small and light. It's almost like children's toy but it's not. It has all the function that normal people would want and it's fairy easy to operate. I loved HP camera. It's so so so easy to operate and there is like no button but the round navigation button and on and off, but, it's ok. This one is near easy. I don't need such and such function. I like just shot and go. The picture is definitely better quality than canon. My canon is cheap one but more than double of this camera's price. what a bargen. Thank you thank you Kodak. I wish they make portable printer. Portable is ripp off and many many people would want to hands on. They now making printer but it's so bulky like every other printer makes. Somehow they make it big. I guess people at the office like big ones, but it's not for me at home. It was going to become smaller at some point but then it got bigger again. They figured it sell better when it's bigger? Down side is small portable ones becomes rip off. They can just put any price and we don't have choice but to buy big one for a cheap or pay extra extra for small ones but they look like they could be switched.
