{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent value for your money.", "Author": "Richard Miranda \"Amazoner\"", "ReviewID": "R321K424ZTOOCS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased the Photosmart M437 for $100/- from Walmart. I was able to use all its features without even reading the manual. What a relief from the other cameras that I used that were cluttered with buttons and dials all over, half of which I did not even know what to use for. The use of the buttons on this camera is intuitive. It has just what we need, no more, no less. I take multiple pictures for every pose and select the best one for printing when I view them on the computer.If you are not a professional and just take family pictures this is the camera for you. And if you think you need more than 5 megapixels, you are insane.This is my 3rd camera in the last 7 years. My first camera was a $400/- Kodak, 2nd was a $280/- Canon. Both of them broke after 2-3 years of use. Every year technology is progressing at such speed, why spend hundreds of dollars on electronics that gets cheaper every year and also on features that you will never even use ?HP is a name I trust. I have used 4 laptops over the last 5 years, 1 Sony, 1 Dell, 2 HPs.  The Sony broke down, the Dell is the slowest though it is the latest and has a unfriendly keyboard/mousepad layout, the 2 HPs I'm most happy with. One of the HPs I have been using for the last 5 years. By now I know HP is a quality company. That is why I purchased this camera and I'm happy with my decision.", "Date": "September 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "a good camera for its price", "Author": "Gheorghe Stratan", "ReviewID": "R1Q62SLUHZDGBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the second time this camera for my friends and I am very satisfied of the quality of the photos, specially the photos taken in the nighttime.

Gates", "ReviewID": "R3LI33YJBLLK3E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I owned this camera for about a year.  The only reason why I have to get a new one is because I carried it in my purse and broke the LCD screen.Generally, I really liked this camera.  It was quick and easy to use (hence carrying it in my purse) and it took pretty good pictures.  I did have some blurry ones, but not too bad. Usually if I was in too much of a hurry.The only drawbacks are that it takes lousy nighttime pictures (everything is dark) and it has a fairly slow shutter, so you have to wait for the camera to focus.It's the first digital camera I owned, so I can't compare it to others at this point.  I thought it was good for the money.  (I paid about 90.00 from wal-mart)I used rechargeable batteries, and usually didn't have to recharge them for weeks.  I would use the camera several times a week.  I did use it for an entire week when I first purchased it (for a trip to Vegas) and the rechargeables worked well the entire time.", "Date": "July 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "So pleased with my new camera!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Catherine Holtzclaw", "ReviewID": "R31RK6TPSW9IKM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I dropped my camera a few weeks ago and wanted another one just like it.  I was lucky to find this one...second hand...and I am thrilled.  Works great and I do not have to change anything on my computer with the manner in which I deal with my pictures.  I hate change...it is SO time consuming!!!  The camera that I found through Amazon is a model that is not made anymore...works great for ME !!!!!!!!!!  Got fast delivery...great seller !!!!", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent buy 4 the price", "Author": "protourist", "ReviewID": "R24KOILYYWZWJZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera was a great buy for the price.

He wanted an easy to use, good quality digital camera under $50 and this fit the bill.  He's had no trouble with it.  Taking pictures is easy, and so is transferring them onto his computer.  He did spend $8 on a thumbnail flashcard, since the built-in memory is pretty feeble, but that was a modest investment.  Now, he can take hundreds of good photos without frustration.", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "five star camera", "Author": "charmaine \"Charmaine\"", "ReviewID": "R1OIDV8FQV6SAL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the M547 HP camera 6pix and the best camera.  Clear pictures and easy to use.  I wanted to purchase another but this model no available so the next best one wasM437 5pix, same ease of use and same quality of picture.  For some reason HP cameras are hard to come buy and not longer seen  in stores, WHY.This is a great camera and perfect for a not so tech person.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Gina M.

Harrell \"lilbadbrew\"", "ReviewID": "R1UTUYXRTRECAP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I came to Amazon just now & bought this again.  The first one I purchased from Walmart two - three years ago.  I loved it, but just dropped it last night & messed up something internally because now the lens doesn't zoom in & out, and the little black shutter thingy won't open.  I am so bummed, I use this camera almost daily.  It takes good pics & I know how to use it & upload to my computer,..  I'm not technically savvy & HATE to figure out & learn new software, programs ect.  In fact i think the hp was only my second digital camera ever!  I was still using an old film camera up till about 5 years ago. Anyhow, since this one works great, & I didn't want to go thru all the learning process again, I bought it again.  Obviously, i'm no expert on digital cameras by any stretch so really can't compare to what else is out there.  For our casual use, this one is as expensive as we want to go.  I realize from what ive read, it's considered on the lower end of the cost scale! yikes!  I can't imagine paying so much for a camera but thats just me.  With my 1st HP-M437, I also purchased several pairs of rechargable batteries so I always have some extras charged up & ready to go.  I haven't owned many electronics, perhaps only a set of two-way radios, an ipod, and two digital cameras lol(refer to above comment about being technically waay behind), but the ones i've owned have been battery hogs, this camera is no exception, however doesn't seem as bad as whatever my first one was. As much as i use it, without rechargables no way i could afford to take pics!The only thing I can think that i'm not wild about, is the battery compartment door slides off really easy.  It's right where your right thumb is whilst aiming. If my thumb slides to the right just barely, off slides the little door & batteries fall out.  On the other hand, I hate when you need 2 screwdrivers & a sledgehammer to open the battery door, so maybe i'm just hard to please,..I definately would recommend this camera.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000N23XFY"}}
