{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Steven J. Streitfeld \"SJS\"", "ReviewID": "RFFEJRWZZWG6R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I should say right from the outset, the most important factor in buying a digital camera for me is the camera's zoom capability.  Several years ago, I began my digital camera collection with a cheap Samsung (S630), followed the year after with the Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ-8 (432mm zoom)  and the next year with the FZ-18 (504mm).  It seems each year, camera companies try to outdo one another with the biggest zoom for the buck.  Several weeks ago, I bought this camera with a mind-numbing 840mm zoom.  Don't be surprised if the 1000 mm zoom comes out next year.  Surprisingly, for a camera with this kind of capability, it is light as a feather and differtentiates itself from the other ultrazooms out there by eliminating the Electronic View Finder completely in favor of a 3\" screen monitor (I suspect this omission may cost them sales).  The instruction manual can be downloaded from the Olympus web site.  The camera's software can be downloaded by connecting the camera to your computer (make sure your memory card has been removed to download software)  What also differentiates it from the others out there is that you can edit the still pictures you have taken using the special effects function from reducing red eye, shadow adjustment, adding/reducting color saturation, and cropping.  Some of these functions were available in my Samsung S630, but in none of the more expensive Lumix models.  With most digitals, if you want to edit your pictures, you would have to download them to your computer and use the camera's editing software or Photoshop.  By using Panorama function you can take up to 3 shots manually or automatically  and the camera's computer \"stitches\" them together into one panoramic wide angle shot. quite a technological achievement.  Also differentiating this camera from its main competitor, the Fuji HS 10, a rather affordable price tag of $349 vs. $499 for the Fuji.  The HS10 also has a smaller manual 720mm zoom and uses 4 AA batteries as its power source, which I consider a disadvantage in taking motion pictures.  The SP 800uz has the capability of adjusting the focal distance during film recording in some modes, not always available in cameras of this class.  Unlike the Lumix cameras, there is no hood lens included to take shots in bright sunlight, a slight disadvantage.  There is no thread on the barrel for attaching wide angle or telephoto lenses, but with an 840 mm telephoto lens, why would you need one?  The camera comes with cables to connect to your computer and your HDTV to playback still and movie pictures in 720i high definition.  A rechargeable lithium battery pack is offered instead of the Alkaline or NiMH rechargeable batteries in Olympus' previous models.  If you take a lot of motion pictures, alkaline or rechargeable NiMH batteries must be replaced or recharged at more frequent intervals than most Lithium battery packs, or you could continue to invest in 12 packs of disposable alkaline cells.  The rating for the included standard Lithium battery pack is 900 mAh.  Imported batteries with a rating of 1400 mAh are available from 3rd party suppliers.  A higher Mah rating means you get more usage between charges since the battery has a higher storage capacity, similar to having a larger gas tank on your car.  Battery capacity is important if you use your camera frequently or take motion pictures which drains the battery...and your memory card.  Another factor to consider is the camera's 2GB internal memory, making it possible to store many pictures without the use of a memory card.  The camera has an app to transfer the pictures taken from the camera's internal memory to the memory card.  The camera accepts SDHC cards up to 8GB, an important consideration if you take a lot of motion pictures.  There are several shooting modes available and the camera has a small user-friendly internal manual to explain each mode and what flash, ISO, aperture, white balance settings are available for each mode, making taking pictures almost foolproof. There is a manual pop up flash for low light conditions.  For shots taken with the digital zoom you should use a tripod to avoid camera shake at the far ranges, a problem endemic to a lot of ultrazoom models, not just this particular model or manufacturer.  This is a great camera if you take sports pictures from the nosebleed seats, go on whale watches frequently, or want to take unobtrusive shots of your subjects from a distance.  With an impressive ISO of up to 3200 sensitivity (unfortunately, the higher the ISO, the higher the distortion and graininess when enlarged for prints) you can also take excellent shots of moving subjects.  I rate this camera highly.", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for amateur and professional", "Author": "Gary Vengley", "ReviewID": "R2A04UMGT5131C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are so many models out there and this camera is really a good fit for those who want to just take good looking photos and videos without having to go to school to learn how to operate this camera.  Once you get past the prelimanary stages of locating all of the buttons and what they do it is pretty easy to perform the functions and it will do just about anything you want it to.  It's versatility is what sells this camera as it doubles as a camera and video so you aren't lugging around equipment when you go out on your vacations or just to the park.  The 30x zoom makes life so easy when you are on trips and can't get close to the subject matter.  We take a lot of cruises so when you are on the balcony and want to take a picture of something that is far away...no problem at all.  The Panarama setting is so easy to operate that it adds another dimension to taking pictures in exotic locations.  The digital age makes it so easy to take and discard photos that you like and don't like and you end up with the 'perfect picture' that you wanted.  14 megapixels will ensure you never have to worry about quality of reproducing photos and since we don't reproduce any photo over an 8x10 we know it will come out perfect.A 4 gb chip is more than you need and gives you enough room for photos and videos.  Anything more than this chip is overkill and who wants to store that many photos on a chip without D/L to a storage area?The only drawback I see on this camera is the setup where you really need to read the instructions so that you don't end up erasing the memory of the camera instructions before you insert the chip.  Our camera did not come with the instruction booklet so I had to go to the website to D/L it and then go step by step from the instructions to set it up.  Very important that you follow this or you will erase the onboard camera memory...that's a bad thing.Camera setupSet the camera date and time, time zoneand display language automatically; installthe camera instruction manual and PCsoftware (ib).Do not insert SD/SDHC memory cardsbefore the camera setup.Do not format the internal memory until thecamera setup is complete.

Actually, I have been using it right out of the box without ever charging and it is still going strong!The setting are easy to access, and a breeze to adjust or just leave it in I/auto as I did for great results.The BadI am quite disappointed with the video capabilities (or LACK of them!) with no optical zoom available for HD video recording unless you switch off the sound! Birthday parties and sports events will never be the same without sound and it beats me why Olympus  would come out with such a stunning camera and leave out such an important feature!I also tried shooting video in VGA mode but still no optical zoom. The camera does allow you to use the digital zoom but it turns decent quality video into a horrible blur! (I could have lived with the digital zoom for my purposes if it had worked better)Also worth a mention is the auto focus on video recording which is very slow, too slow for me.The Pro'sReally excellent quality build, this camera will last for years!!! (if you don't end up returning it)Excellent 30x optical zoom capabilityGreat looking design, compact and lightLong battery life, I still have not charge the battery yet and have taken 100 photos and 20 minutes of video.Nice LCD screenExcellent quality photos (well,to my eyes, everyone will have their own opinion)Many nice features that should satisfy most folks.2 gig built in memoryThe badNo zoom capability when recording video with soundSlow auto-focus when shooting video (too slow for me)No HDMI cable included (seems to be standard with most camera makers)The \"magic\" settings, are just a cheap gimmick and not worth bothering with.On the Olympus web-site, the spec's for the camera include 1080i HD video, it DOES NOT have this feature!As you can see, there are a lot of pluses with this camera and one big minus, and because I planned to use this for wildlife photography where the zoom will come in handy; as well as to record video of birthday parties and some soccer games the lack of zoom capability is hard to swallow.I was aware that the camera may have a zoom issue but the digital zoom would have been suffice it would have worked better. The auto focus on the zoom is also slow.I have also ordered the FUJI HS10 and will receive it this week. I will be doing a comparison of these two cameras and decide then which to keep!Bottom line is this is a five star camera if you plan use it for photography ONLY and a great buy for the money. However, if you also need it for video, I don't recommend it!", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "You Buy This For the Ultra Zoom - Great Pictures", "Author": "Tom D", "ReviewID": "R3BERV9D5JOAEV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some of the reviews for this camera don't make sense or are for a different model.  For example, the zoom is fully functional on my SP-800UZ in video mode.  But if you're buying this camera, you want it for the ultra-zoom, in a light, relatively compact camera that delivers sharp pictures.  There's an old expression that goes something like, \"what kind of camera takes the best pictures?  The one you have with you.\" You may be able to get a better photo with a RAW image from a digital SLR with a $1,500 lens (or more.  This has one of the best digital zoom's I've used; most are useless.  I took photos of lighthouses over water 7 and 9 miles away and got better detail than you could see through a telescope.What's amazed me most, especially at this price point, is the sharpness of the images across the zoom range.  I'll try to post a picture of a fly and a spider on a humingbird feeder.  In the original you can see the hairs on the fly and the threadlike legs of the spider from a distance of about 15 feet.  I have another of a wild turkey at about 40 feet that shows the details of his feathers and hairy head.  People at 300' are easily recognizable.Don't expect this camera to do unreasonable things that others don't do either.  The built in flash has a limited range, maybe 10' to 12' before it starts to fall off.  On the other hand, you don't really need a flash for most indoor shots unless it's candle light.Read the manual.  Sorry, this one's only intuitive after you read the manual.  Just try to find video mode for example, without the manual...you might get there.I miss a viewfinder.  I knew this camera didn't have one and decided to live without it.  But with the ultra-zoom at full zoom, finding an airplane in a backlit sky is a hit and miss exercise; you have to back way off the zoom, find the plane, then try to zoom in while holding it on the screen.The only real complaint is that the focusing software sometimes has trouble finding what to focus on  and it takes a couple of attempts to get to the right portion of the image.  That only seems to be a problem at higher zooms.  It's especially troublesome when again you're trying to find a small plane in a large blue sky, or the flip side, a boat on a large lake while flying over.Read the instructions, practice a bit, learn the camera and unless you want to lug the big stuff, this will be your camera of choice for most occasions.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good camera....", "Author": "lordhoot \"lordhoot\"", "ReviewID": "R2LJ0RM3582L68", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Having used this camera for several days, I can basically say that this camera falls right between your basic point and shoot and ultrazoom. I will try to write this review so it won't terribly overlapped some of the other well written reviews. For those thinking this is the next step after SP590UZ, you are pretty wrong. Although zoom is extended to 30x, your camera features are more closer to your basic point and shoot camera. This is clearly indicted by the fact that Olympus did away with the electronic view finder and manual adjustment features that previous SP series had.I have read the previous reviews on video capabilities of this camera. They are mostly on the mark. I don't think Olympus cameras were any good with their videos and they are still light-years behind Canon SX20 IS and SX10 IS on that score. You don't buy this camera to take video. You buy this camera because it easier then heck to use and it got 30x optical zoom. (Of course, I would have prefer a wider angle for little less zoom.)On one super positive side, they did away with Olympus xD cards (Thank the Camera Gods!) and now you can used SD cards like any other good cameras out there. On the sadder note, they did away with the AA batteries to power this on and switch to li-on battery. Of course, li-on battery is better for video but this Olympus camera, like all others, happened to be pretty lame with their video capability so you will be shooting more photos then video. AA batteries in my book is better because you can always get your hand on more batteries. Also taking away four AA batteries made this camera too light. With no EVF and light camera, shooting at long zoom can be chore even with their well made image stabilizer system. Having wrote that, I have to say that this camera is very comfortable to hold. But like any other point and shoot that relied strictly on LCD monitor, you will suffer on very sunny days when that LCD become very hard to look through. That is why for camera of this much zoom, EVF is mandatory and this camera don't have it.The camera performed pretty well in lighted area but I regret to say that the photos comes out bit grainy and noisy as the light fades. The auto focus seem to be inconsistent in the darker places and I am not sure why. The flash works pretty well though but its hard to manage it.If you look at the back of this camera, you will realized with much horror or with some relief (depending on what you like) that there is almost no buttons back there. There is this red button for video and a button for playback mode. Rest is used for surfing the menu system. For me at least, I find it a pain to navigate through all these menus to adjust this and that as I want it. Especially when I am adjusting and adapting as I shoot. Usually most cameras of this type got EV adjustment button, self timer button, marco-micro button and all that. Not with this camera, you got to go through the menu system for just about everything. Some may like this, I did not so that is one of the reasons why I gave it only three stars.This camera is hybrid between a basic point and shoot and your latest ultrazoom. Lacking EVF and manual control features make this closer to the a basic point and shoot with a big zoom. I am not sure who wants something like this but I am sure somebody does.I hope this review complements the other reviews out there. Most are pretty good, pointing out the pros and the cons of this camera in their own colorful style.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Overall Value", "Author": "Randolph Wein \"Upto N. O'Good\"", "ReviewID": "R3LPB4X85XDYBT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This brand new entry from Olympus still is not widely known. But along with its little brother, the SP-600UZ, it offers the most features at one of the lowest prices of any \"hybrid\" camera (top-end point-and-shoots that approach the quality at nowhere near the price of SLRs).Frequent promotions lower the typical shelf price of the SP-800UZ from approximately $349 to approximately $289. The 600UZ is about $100 less, but offers fewer options at reduced quality, and a zoom only half as powerful.What is to like about Olympus' new flagship? A LOT!Start with the largest lens ever on a point-and-shoot. Zoom factor always is the first feature I look for, and this is the first hybrid to reach the 30x mark. That gives MUCH flexibility for your shots, no matter the setting or subject.The second-most important feature for me is burst-shot capacity. Again Olympus shatters the standard, moving from the previous offering of one setting to five! Three are the traditional rapid-fire exposures, offering fast, faster, and fastest. At the other extreme is a setting that takes almost portrait quality shots, but with much quicker recovery time between exposures. It really is not a true burst, but a cross between burst and automatic settings.The fifth burst setting is the feature I find most useful. This sets the camera to take a quick a very short pause between each exposure to refocus and recalibrate for changes in lighting and distance. The result is much higher quality shots than with typical burst with little sacrifice of continuity.Of course all the burst settings sacrifice some of the lens excellence and flexibility offered by the special settings. However, shots still are good quality (and can be edited to become even better). And when shooting dynamic settings, such as picnics and birthday parties (but NOT fast-action sports), you are likely to get -- even if by the law of averages --  at least one good-to-excellent shot per burst.The significant negative to this otherwise wonderful camera is the ease of use. So many features are packed into the sturdy, lightweight and excellently shaped build that making them all easily accessable proved to be a challenge so far unmet.Once found, the features are excellent and give wonderful flexibility in composing and exposing your pictures.Video capability is the other most common -- but to me unfair -- criticism. The video feature is greatly improved from previous Olympus models. However, do not make the mistake of thinking this will replace or substitute for a video camera.This is a single-shot camera! It also is capable of capturing moving images and sound, but not nearly at the level of its single exposures.Overall, this model's power (size of lens, 14 mp exposures, flash flexibility, and long-lasting batteries that re-charge quickly from typical outlet converter or more slowly within the camera when connected by USB cable to a computer)and features (variety of exposure, style, and effects settings) make the SP-800UZ almost untouchable in its market niche.Factor in the regular price reductions, and to me the choice is clear.

Setup was a breeze and I learned the camera after about two hours of playing with the settings.  The zoom is incredible and and super close up pictures are the best I've ever taken.  I've seen some other reviews that have been critical of the camera's few manual settings, but, seeing as how I'm an extreme amateur I like the auto settings.  Taking good pictures is more important to me than being a good photographer. I'm also not bothered by the lack of an optical eyepiece, as the LCD screen is strong and clear even in sunlight.  I was a little leary of purchasing such a new camera that had so few user reviews, but after having used it, I would make the same decision again.UPDATE:  20 months after I purchased the camera and I'm still loving it!  I've gotten some magnificent shots, ranging from a full moon with craters clearly visible to birds in my backyard feeder with the tiny seeds from the feeder showing clearly in their beaks. I've also gotten several frameworthy shots with this camera, all using the automatic settings.

I find that saving images to internal memory is much faster than saving to a card.  Camera also has functionality for transferring photos and video from internal memory to a card inside the camera.-- Appears to be very well-made.  Although the casing is made of plastic, the camera looks and feels very solid.  My impression is that this camera will last a long time.-- Weight:  A bit heavier than a point-and-shoot, but light enough that I can easily carry it with me most places.  Because of it's size, it doesn't fit in a pocket, but it does fit in a small carry-on or large purse.-- Consistent photo quality.  I'm consistently getting excellent outdoor photos and very good indoor photos.-- The 30x optical zoom works great.  I'm getting very clear outdoor pictures at full zoom.  Indoor zoomed pictures are slightly grainy, but that's true of many cameras in this price range.-- Option of varying the resolution from 3MP to 12MP.  I rarely need 12MP, so by using a lower resolution, I get many more images before having to transfer them to a card or computer.-- Video: Exactly what I was looking for.  Great for capturing events with family and friends.  Includes decent audio that can optionally be turned off.  With audio turned off, you can zoom while filming.-- Small, light-weight Li-Ion battery.  I'm getting about 300 photos and 10-15 minutes of video per charge.  Battery recharges in about 2 hours.  I just keep two additional batteries on hand, and I'm good to go in pretty much any situation.  (I found the best prices for extra batteries here on Amazon.)-- Price:  Great value for the price.  I got it on sale at a big-box store; worth every penny.-- Very good macro and super macro.  After a bit of a learning curve, I'm now consistently getting great macro and super-macro pictures.-- Filters:  These are more fun than I expected.  I didn't think I'd use them at all, but I do.  The \"coloring book\" filter is great for making personalized coloring books for the children in my life.-- Includes an option to add several seconds of audio to still pictures.  Very handy for quick descriptions of pictures so you don't forget later.-- Built-in Flash:  I like the fact that it the flash never pops-up automatically.  It will fire automatically in certain modes, but if you don't want the flash at all (and I often don't), you just leave the flash closed.Could be Better, but Do-Able:-- Size:  From an ergonomic standpoint, I wish it were a little bit larger.  Initially, my hands felt cramped when using the camera, but I got used to the size after about a month.-- Menu-based controls.  In terms of both convenience and ergonomics, I strongly prefer buttons and dials.  Buttons and dials are easier for me than going through menus.  Additionally, the control (a combination button/dial) that is used to access the menu is fairly small and almost flush to the back of the camera.  I have average-size hands, and it took me awhile before I was comfortable with the menu conroller.  I imagine this would be even more challenging for someone with larger hands.I initially planned to return the camera because of the ergonomic issues.  But I only found a couple of other cameras in my price range that were more comfortable ergonomically, and both of those had too many other negatives.  I've since found a more comfortable way to hold the Olympus and am gradually getting used to the menus.  The camera does such good job in auto mode that I often just leave it there and don't bother with other options.-- No view finder:  I wish it had one, but that is becoming less of an issue the more I use the camera.-- User Guide:  Entirely digital.  If you want hardcopy, you have to print the 70+ pages yourself.  The manual is pretty good, but I'd like to see a little more detail in some areas.-- Focusing:  It took me awhile to figure out how the camera focuses.  But now that I've gotten through the learning curve, I'm consistently getting very good pictures.-- Camera cannot be used right out of the box.  It must first be initialized, a process that requires connecting the camera to a computer.  At least for me, the initialization process was not very intuitive.-- Error messages: This is probably the camera's weakest point for me.  If I'm changing settings, I sometimes get an error message saying I can't choose a particular option because it conflicts with another setting already in place, but it doesn't tell me which one.  The user guide doesn't have a chart or summary explaining this, either.  So I'm left to either trial-and-error or digging through the lengthy manual to determine which settings work with each other and which do not.Bottom Line:I wanted a camera that was between a basic point-and-shoot and a DSLR and had basic video capability.  I also had a limited budget.  This camera fits the bill.", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not the best camera in it's field. Customer support not good.", "Author": "Daniel J. Burejsza", "ReviewID": "RRYRFHDXR3LV6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There are no manual modes for either exposure or focus. Sometimes you can trick the camera into the right exposure by selecting one of the various program options or scene modes, but there is no way to convince it to focus properly when it chooses not to. I have a bird feeder on my front porch. In low light, (like dusk), I can't get close enough to the feeder for the infrared light on the camera to help with focusing, (Birds fly away). Attempting to focus on other objects that are a similar distance away, (as the manual recommends), also does not work. In bright light it is hard to tell if the camera is in good focus because the screen is difficult to see, (there is no viewfinder to block out screen glare). The lens cap constantly falls off, exposing the lens to possible damage and there is no way to fasten on a protective uv filter.The camera comes bundled with software called \"ib\". This software has a bug that will not let me run it without entering an activation code. I emailed Olympus customer support several times asking for the code. They say it doesn't exist. Once they suggested that I use other software. When I suggested that I could also use another brand of camera as well, they transfered me to another department at Olympus. I have emailed them again several times and they insist that I call them by phone so that I can help resolve their problem.I am not happy with a company that wants me to spend my time repairing their mistakes.Today I would buy a camera that has a viewfinder, manual exposure, and manual focus options. Having a large zoom and a automatic camera is fine, but only if the pictures are in focus. I can use computer software to lighten or darken a picture, but there is not much you can do with a blurry picture.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Definate improvement over my previous Olympus Ultrazooms", "Author": "Macuser", "ReviewID": "R2OG17AP1W2QV1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have previously owned two other ultra zoom Olympus cameras (C-770UZ and SP-570UZ) and after reading some lukewarm reviews about the image quality of the SP-800UZ I was a bit hesitant to buy one, but after one day of owning it I feel pleased overall.This camera is indeed a paradox because although it apparently was intended for point and shoot novices, the image quality out of the box in iAuto mode is not that great (focus is soft and color saturation is on the flat side and there are no in camera adjustments possible to correct those deficiencies as there are on the C770UZ and SP570UZ).  However, an experienced user quickly finds out that in P (Program) mode with the ISO set at 50 and the white balance set for sunshine, the sharpness and colors in outdoor landscape shots substantially improves. Then after adding additional sharpness and color saturation to the images in a photo editing program the image quality looks stunning!  So in the end my still photos with the SP800UZ are very pleasing and satisfying.I also found the criticism about \"noisy, out of focus images\" in full or near full telephoto mode is unwarranted if the ISO is set at 50 and a tripod or some other support is used.  I also found the criticism about the \"tiny fingernail operated control wheel\" unwarranted because once you get used to it, using it becomes second nature.One criticism I would agree with is the camera occassionally has trouble focusing, but my guess is I can rectify this via more closely paying attention to where the target box is positioned.The lack of a viewfinder is a slight inconvience in some situations, but I have to admit I rarely used it on my other two Olympus ultrazooms.The 2GB of internal memory is super nice as is the cameras small size and lightweight.

I started with a 2 megapixel model and each year or two bought a new one, usually to coincide with a trip I was taking abroad which I wished to document and would probably never be able to repeat. I have taken thousands and thousands of photographs with Olympus SP cameras, and have been especially impressed by and eager for extensions of the optical zooms as I am often at some distance from the subject of my photos (eagles nesting in Alaska, Penguins ashore in Antarctica, statues at the top of some very tall column in Barcelona, a painting high on a wall in Eureka, my dog frisking in the field at home). You can imagine then how I looked forward to getting the SP-800UZ with both an increase in zoom (from 26-30) and megapixels. I expected to be able to get better photos of the same type of subjects as I had been shooting, and with the 15% increase in zoom, some new subjects which had been previously out of my reach. I got the SP-800UZ for a cruise trip from London across the North Atlantic to Nova Scotia and then Florida.  We had two stops in Iceland and I was determined to see the great waterfalls, get some shots of the scenery sailing into and out of the ports,  and take in the London scenes.I was disappointed in this camera almost from the outset. I had to give up and stop using it a few days into the cruise and substitute my older SP which I had brought along as a backup in case something happened to the SP 800UZ. Here are the problems: the new camera has been redesigned. It is smaller, and lighter, than its predecessors. Being also rated at higher megapixels and optical zoom this sounds like a win-win-win-win. But the redesign has made the handle - that protrusion at the front right of the camera- smaller. When you grip the camera your palm tends to rest on the control panel of the device, which is at the right rear. Your palm resets the controls, sometimes while you are shooting. I am not a power user. I want automatic focus and stability controls on and I'm happy.  I have had to stop and manually adjust the settings back to those settings virtually every shot I have taken. This means no more fast shots - no more seeing something interesting and whipping the camera round to get it. Or rather it means more blurry shots of something which might have been a good photo (see focus below, too). These \"bus window\" shots are vital to those of us who can travel, but can't hire a private vehicle in each port.Moreover the auto-focus is at the same time poor, and slow. You have to wait much longer than with the prior cameras in this line before the camera is satisfied that it has a focus. And even then it is usually wrong. You won't notice this until you load the photos onto your computer and see them at screen size. They may look ok in the display on the camera back but they won't on the computer, especially if you crop or enlarge them (the point of having 14 megapixels).  if you want to be sure of your shot as you take it, shoot, then set the camera to display so you can see the shots you have taken. Pick one, then zoom in on the photo. It will likely tend to blur out quick early in the zoom. If you have a stationary target and all the time in the world you can delete the poorly focused shots and repeat them until you get something better. I usually have a target which is moving relative to me, and no time to get more than that 1st shot. That first shot which has been so satisfactory to me on my earlier Olympus cameras, and so disappointingly elusive with this one.Shots at the full zoom are the worst, focus-wise. I did not find that the extra 15% of zoom got me any improvement in photo quality at all. All you get, in effect, is an extra extension of zoom which is entirely lost in the blur of going beyond the capacity of the camera to focus.And then there is the battery situation. The earlier cameras took 4xAA batteries. The new one takes one of those light, slim, lithium batteries which are expensive, difficult to find while traveling, require a special charger, are incompatible from one brand of camera to another, and, just for the kicker, don't last long in this camera. I found that if I were going on an all-day trip - and an-all day trip on a cruise is about 6 hours- I should take at least two extra batteries with me. Batteries which I had to buy before the trip and spend some time charging on the ship the evening prior to the trip.Another way the camera was made smaller, and lighter, was by eliminating the viewfinder. The theory is that the display is now so improved that the sun will not wash it out when you are shooting outdoors, so you don't need the viewfinder. This theory is mistaken.Ok, lets sum up: The placement of the controls and the grip on the camera case create a design disaster making it very difficult to rely on the settings when you shoot. The auto-focus is very slow and not very good, making quick photos almost impossible to successfully shoot. The display will wash out in strong light so you'll have to take some shots without being able to frame the picture you are taking -which means some people will lose their heads or feet. The battery is expensive, doesn't last long when you are using the camera, and often incompatible with similar batteries in other cameras (and their chargers) so don't count on being able to borrow from your shipmate, or to help them out.If all you want to do is take routine snapshots of things that are relatively close to you and don't move, which you can redo if you are not pleased with the first try, and if you're ok with pictures that are more or less in focus, this camera will probably work for you. So will many much simpler, cheaper cameras. No matter what your goal this is not the camera to buy if you have any alternatives at all. I'm going to sell mine, cheap. My advice is: don't buy it.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "I have used many cameras in past 50 years but..", "Author": "Peakperformance Ken", "ReviewID": "R8JN0Q9IA7W4K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have used many cameras in 50+ years and am relatively computer knowledgable but this camera is the most COUNTER intuitive piece of equipment that I have ever had the displeasure to use.

I haven't bought myself a new camera in years, and I have an old Olympus C740UZ that I just love (it has taken a beating and still takes awesome pictures).  In December 2006 I had bought a new Olympus SP-510 and returned it, but I read some good reviews on the SP800-UZ so I figured I'd give Olympus another chance.I am definitely not a professional photographer, but I am certainly an above average amateur.  I have gigs of pictures and everyone is always complementing me on my shots.I will say that yes, you can take amazing pictures with this camera...IF you have everything set exactly right and the time to fiddle with it between shots.  Not practical if you are shooting your kid or pet doing something cute right now!  As far as snap and shoot forget it.Pros:-Very nice design, fits well in my hand and controls were easy to use and accessible.-Beautiful large display screen.-Amazing zoom (see also cons).Cons:-Focuses slowly and often not on the desired target.-Pictures were often over/underexposed and colors tended to be off.-You DEFINITELY need a tripod if you go over about 15x optical zoom.I took almost 500 pictures with this camera over the period of about two weeks under many different light conditions.  On the iAuto mode (their snap and shoot setting) even on a bright sunny day, many of the pictures of my daughter playing in the pool were blurry.  I couldn't believe it! Pictures of her playing at a playground at dusk were underexposed on almost every scene setting, and the pink of her skirt was not right in any of the shots.Menu choices are often odd too.  For example, on the iAuto mode, you cannot set the rapid shutter settings.  Attempting to allow digital zoom for shooting video always gave me an error message that I had incompatible settings.Reflections (especially bright sun on yellow) completely wash out to white.  I tried changing the shadow setting, the white balance and just about every mode, but couldn't get the shots of black-eyed Susan's not to have white spots on them.  My old Olympus and my daughter's little Kodak did not have this issue, they correctly captured the light yellow my eye saw.If you max the optical zoom, even if you stabilize the camera, clicking the shutter is often enough to blur the shot.  I did get one good shot of a bluebird fairly far away, but I reviewed the shot, went to take another and the camera was locked up!  By the time I remedied the situation, he was gone.  This is ultimately why I returned the camera (like I said I REALLY wanted to like it).  I returned the camera because about 50% of the time when I went from reviewing a shot to try to take another picture it would lock up.  It locked so badly that it would only reset by popping out the battery!Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed in this camera, and am definitely NOT buying another Olympus!", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Do Not Recommend", "Author": "Katherine Gonzalez", "ReviewID": "R25Z2FY7E5Z8AK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have purchased several cameras over the past year, and this is by far the worse camera I have ever bought.

I have seen many travelers buy cameras with optional lens and they look professional but by the time they decide which lens to use and get everything setup they have lost the shot. This camera will allow you to get the shot quickly since you have the zoom capability in one lens. Another feature is that you have to manually engage the flash so you will not be taking flash pictures accidentally where you are not allowed to use the flash.

The shots I've gotten so far with the SP800-UZ have mostly been spectacular!  I mean professional quality!  The resolution is excellent, and it has two ways of magnifying the optical zoom: fine zoom, and digital zoom.  It can shoot a leaf from twenty feet away and make it look like a macro shot.  Speaking of macro, it can focus to within 1cm of the subject in Super Macro mode!  It's not great in low light, but a long zoom and low light ability are usually mutually exclusive.  It has a power-saver mode which I use most of the time, which greatly extends battery life.  It has lots of modes which let you express yourself, my favorite being Magic Drawing mode, which takes photos which look like pencil sketches.  It takes panoramic shots and stitches them together in-camera (my Nikon requires uploading to a computer) The Olympus photo-handling system seems to be better than that of Nikon.  It's feather-light for a camera with such a long zoom (less than a pound).  It does seem to have a long shutter delay, and the off-center tripod mount makes it off-balance on a small tripod.

Parker", "ReviewID": "R1Y0KETAVOPEYG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I started digital photography in 2005 with an Olympus C765-uz, 4 mp with which I got some of the best shots I've ever taken, especially with the super macro.  Despite later adding two Canon dslr's and a Panasomic Lumix, I was still looking for a higher megapixel version of the 765 and have found it in the 800uz.  Things I like about the 800 uz are its size and feel, its comparatively quick shutter response, the ease of menu usage, much higher mp's, and its flexibility from quality super macro to 30x zoom all in one camera.  Compared to the older Olympus and the Panasomic, visibility with the view screen is much better in bright light which makes up somewhat for the lack of a viewfinder.  Things I don't like are having to recharge batteries in the camera (no external battery charger provided), and the shorter battery life compared to any of the above-mentioned cameras, at least for my first usage.  Fortunately, the one I got came with 3 batteries.  Great camera for the price.Following up after about 6 months of usage, I have additional comments.  The camera continues to be excellent for scenes, panoramas, and reasonable zooms with good light, especially of things like butterflies and dragonflies.  Photo quality, of birds for example, at the highest zoom is usually fair to poor.  I've found a dilemma in usage in that you have to re-set almost everything every time the camera is turned off, but if you leave it on in anticipation of subjects, then the battery goes rather quickly.  I have found myself going back to the smaller Panasonic and larger Canon more often in recent months, although I would still favor this camera for its diversity when I'm on longer hikes and not wanting to weigh myself down with a dslr and its lenses.", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Room for Improvement", "Author": "MLB", "ReviewID": "RRYQH43ERVAPO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've been using high zoom digital cameras for several years and take all sorts of pictures.  I like the ease of a high zoom point and shoot with some manual control.  I decided to try the new Olympus because of 30x zoom capabilities and other features.  The creative art filter to make a picture look like a drawing is pretty neat and has proven to be useful.The SP800uz doesn't seem to have the same vibrant color and clarity that my previous digital offered.  The auto focus is inconsistent.  Sometimes it takes multiple refocus attempts and/or multiple shots to get a clear picture.  This is very frustrating when a great shot is lost due to the camera's inability to focus (even with the auto focus assist light).  The camera needs the stability of a tripod even when it's not at full zoom, despite the fact that it's supposed to have dual image stabilization.I've also noticed that the white balance is off.  Sometimes the colors are right on and other times (same setting and lighting) they come out with a yellowish tint.The 800uz boasts of a 3\" LCD viewing screen.  This is deceptive as it only uses about 2\" of the screen for typical picture display with a black border on each side.  I contacted Olympus regarding this, after several days they replied only to inform me that this is normal and the only way you get use of the full 3\" screen would be to change the quality setting to 16:9 mode or while shooting video.

The camera has plenty of good qualities and just as many bad qualities.The Pros:*Exceptional zoom (30x optical is unheard of on a camera like this)*Great picture quality at 14 mega pixels*HD video always looks great*Fairly compact.  Just a little too big to fit in one's pockets, but not bulky at all.*Nice big screen makes life way easier when you can see the picture you just took.The Cons:*Battery life is horrid.  Mine usually lasts just a few hours on a full charge.  I blame the big screen and the camera having to work to adjust the giant lens.  Even when avoiding adjusting the zoom, don't expect much from one battery.  Always carry at least one spare if you are going to be out for a whole day.*Auto focus can be very slow at times.  This is especially frustrating when you are trying to get a pic of moving wildlife or something like that.  Also the camera seems to over or under focus more than any other camera I have used.*The menu is a bit confusing at first.  It's even more frustrating when you want to change a setting but the camera won't let you and only says \"Conflicting Settings\" but doesn't want to tell you what you need to change to have unconflicting settings.*The special settings such as the \"auto panorama\" and, my personal favorite, \"tracking focus,\" though great when they work, usually don't work.  The auto panorama stitches together a series of pics to make one big picture, only problem is the camera doesn't always take the picture in the right place so by no fault of your own the pics frequently don't line up correctly.  And the auto tracking function rarely tracks the right thing you select, and when it actually does track the right thing it usually doesn't focus on it correctly.And I'm not judging this whole model of camera on this, but just months after I got it the flash broke.

If you use extensive zoom and image stabilizer features, the batteries get sucked down in no time at all. And when you are out in the emiddle of nowhere it gets a little expensive to carry a cadre of Olympus OEM batteries with you at $40 a pop. And we all know the predictability of aftermarket batteries for $5 each. My old Olympus C3040Zoom with its conventional 4 AA batteries outlives the SP-800UZ's daily expensive battery change by a month or more. Take a hint, Olympus!I've only had the camera for approximately four months but am beginning to notice that it apparently draws significant power from the battery when it is not being used. If you do not use it over a period of a few weeks it is best to keep it plugged in to either the charger or the computer so as to keep the battery up to full charge. These little batteries are simply too small for a camera of this magnitude.Then there is the charging issue. Why only offer a stock camera with just the feature of USB charging? Are we tied to our computers everywhere we go? It doesn't cost that much to throw in an external charger so as not to totally disable your camera while charging batteries. And as far as I can see, Olympus doesn't offer one! Yes, there are aftermarket chargers available but the life of the tiny batteries almost dictates using an external battery pack connected to the camera by the USB cable. Not a great solution but would allow you to take photos with more abandon without worrying when your camera is going to go to sleep. And it is more bulk to carry around to compensate for a simple oversight in the camera's design.Other comments: The lens is OK but sports noticeable optical aberrations at extended zoom ranges.

I had plans to buy a different camera but my friend being excited by 30x zoom capability gifted this to me and ruined my plans. I accepted it whole heartedly and tried to like it whole heartedly but I haven't succeeded yet. This is what I think about the camera.Most of the weight of the camera is from the lens, still its not heavy. The build quality is very good and the controls are easy. It does gives lot of freedom to experiment. LCD screen is quite impressive so is 30x zoom. The photographs and video taken in sufficient light are quite good. Battery live is good. I especially liked panoramic mode. It has capability to take photo in bursts, with different exposure and focus.Coming to the cons, this camera does not impress when it comes to photo quality in low light. By low light I do not mean really low light. I have 6 13w cfl lighting up my 25X40ft room and still the camera will not take good photographs. The photographs look alright on the LCD but are soft as you zoom in. The photo quality will go down if you increase the ISO or zoom. Any ISO above 200 is guaranteed to give a soft or grainy photo. One way to take alright photo in low light it to use very low ISO and use a tripod but this is not feasible all the time and still the photographs will not be crisp. As a matter of fact higher ISO are useless even when its bright sunny day. Story is same for video too. There is another problem with video, you cant zoom in or out once the recording starts.So its up to you if you want zoom and alright with bad performance in low-light photo and high ISO you can give this camera a try.

I used it for about an hour before I figured out the digital zoom was turned off out of the box. Once turned on it really came to life ,it was really neat. I could zoom in on a poster across the room and read the printed date. Also with this camera a tri pod is going to be a great addition. Stable photos with great zoom in a handheld seem very hard. Stick it on a tripod and they really become much more clear and easier to take. The Macro setting is crazy.

A lot of folks gave bad reviews on this camera. I think this is not a fair judgement. As I believe that quality of pictures are determined by the \"photographer\"-you, who handle the camera, not from the cost of a camera. I have seen some of my friends take sloppy photos with $2,000 camera. You can take very nice pictures if you learn how to use all the built-in functions offered by SP-800UZ. If you love wildlife like me and like to take birds and nature and DO NOT want to carry heavy duty DSLR equipment, this camera is for you. A lot of people complained pictures got very blurry at higher zoom. I found an easy solution by adding a tripod. You can manually adjust many details, including the lighting makes this point and shot camera almost an entry level DSLR. Again, you just need to learn all the functions well and to me, I downloaded a user manual from Olympus official site ([...]) and read the total 73 pages. Please save the user manual on your PC instead of printing it(save trees). Some people also complained about the manual does not come with the package. Hello, please wake up, we are at a tech era. You can find any thing online these days.I bought this camera in July and did not want to write any review until I am certain its capability. When I showed some of my bird pictures to friends, they told me \"you must have a nice DSLR\". I told them \"nop\". They just could not believe me. Sure, if you are a professional, you should not look at this review or this camera. But, if you are an amature or you do not have the $ to buy a DSLR (let's say you are saving $ for that), or you just want to take some memorable photos, you might want to consider Olympus SP-800UZ.To see is to believe. Check my birding website at [...] (copy this link and paste onto your search engine)for all photos (photos taken after July this year) and videos/Movies (BTW, great HD videos) I took from this little camera. Again, this is not a perfect camera. But for the price of it, it is at top of line at 30X zoom and, let this camera amazes you![...]P.S.

I didn't realize this when I bought it and for me it makes a big difference.  This camera is less intuitive than my other camera, a Canon PowerShot S5 IS.  I have tried changing some settings and I keep getting a message, \"conflicting settings\".  I can't seem to get it to 30x zoom.  The zoom is currently not much better than the 12x on my S5.  I did a test with these two cameras.  I stood in one spot and took the same shot with each camera.  The S5 didn't zoom in quite as close, but the resulting photo was better and clearer when enlarged, even though it is an 8MP compared with the Olympus' 14MP.  I admit I have not read the online manual, but I never needed to read the manual for the S5 and I have used it for 2+ years without the same difficulties.  The only reason I bought the Olympus SP-800UZ was for the 30x zoom, which I assumed would be FAR better than a 12x. I'm thinking of returning this camera if I can't get this issue resolved.

It has a nice flash to brighten the photo if needed. A lot of times I don't use the flash. I think you get a lot out of this camera for the money. Sometimes it may take a while to focus, but it is not bad at all. This is something else I was looking for. I didn't want a camera that took a long time to focus on every picture. I am that type of person that does a lot of research before I buy something. This is what I decided to buy and have been happy with it.

My Fuji was a good camera, I loved it, but it had so many features that I would get really confused trying to operate it, other than just point and shoot.  I read the reviews on the Olympus SP-800UZ, and was excited about the 30X Zoom that it provided.  I am an amature at taking photographs, but I love pictures, all the in's and out's of photography is more than I have patience for with any camera, so all I want is a good picture result, with whatever I use to take pictures with.  I could do without the video in a camera, for I have a video camcorder that I like to use when I do take video's.  I wasn't looking for that in a camera, but most I looked at with higher pixels and zoom features had the video as well.  I received my Olympus camera the next day after I ordered it.  Amazon is good to send the items I have ordered promptly.  My card didn't come till the third day after I received the camera, but that was ok, as I was getting use to the camera somewhat, and playing with the zoom.  I do really like the zoom, the menu seems nice and easy to understand as well.  One thing I did not like, is the software that came within the camera, of which I do not intend to use, I use Paint Shop Pro for my pictures.  I uninstalled the software after reviewing it, and just simply browsed thru my Paint Shop Pro software and received the pictures from the camera that way.  When I received the card I had purchased for use with the camera, I formated and that seemed to solve the problem of my computer hanging up when the camera would load the software, it seemed to just keep wanting to load the software for some reason, maybe I wasn't doing something right, but since I didn't like the camera's software anyways, problem with that was solved, or I hope so!  The manual I installed onto my computer, and kept.  The setup instructions was confusing to say the least, and the print was so tiny I had to use a magnifier to see it!  The zoom is nice, but when you are zoomed to full capacity it is hard to focus, the least movement blurs the image.  I will have to learn how to do that correctly.  I haven't taken but a few pictures to get the feel of the camera, but what pictures I took that I kept a steady hand was really nice.  It took the battery a long time to charge thru the computer, so I used the adapter after about 4 hours waiting.  I would have given a five star rating on first impression of this camera, I like how it feels, and once I get used to it's functions, and learn some about it I think I will grow to really love it, the only thing that wasn't to my liking was the included software with the camera, the tiny print of the Quick Start Instructions and it's lack of clarity in directions, and the charging of the battery time.  I have an extra battery due to come soon, and know right off that I will need one charged as back up, if I am to use my camera extensively.  I like dealing with Amazon, and I hope to love this camera eventually for it is nice in most all of it's features.  For someone who is not an expert either with camera's or the picture taking in's and out's, doing thing's manually with a camera, I think the menu within this camera will be a big help to me.

I even bought a delkin shield(3 inch which doesn't perfectly fit)and it has minimum effect on the glare. I hope olympus comes up with a sunshade as an accessory in the near future. Love the zoom and in my opinion it takes sequential pictures at super speed.  I gave it a 4 because of the glare problem. Also love the ease of making panoramic pictures. It is soooooo easy. Some reviewers complain that you have to do everything via the menu on the screen. It is very easy to figure out how to use the features and there are even explanations about the features when you browse through the menu. Very intuitive and user friendly.

The zoom was rewarding, but of course some rules had to be obeyed at its maximum. The Fine Zoom gives you a plus in performance at the price of the image size (8M maximum). I liked the menu also (mainly the classical selection wheel transfered within the display). I'd liked to mention some other nice features (photo \"paraphernalia\" if you wish) like the auto-mode panorama and the drawing mode.At the beginning I've been rather upset by the absence of the manual mode (the lack of the viewfinder had not been a problem for me); then I've discovered I could emulate the desired configurations by the settings in the menu, admittedly a more complicated way.When shooting movies you have to decide if you want to use the optical zoom variation and no sound recording, or to choose the sound and the digital zoom variation only. I think this is because the zooming in being rather noisy.As drawbacks besides the ones in the list I'd like to mention the battery charging through the camera, so blocking any activity during the action.

I first saw it from a T.V. retailer and ordered it on wait list. My old point and shoot was only 2 years old but I was starting to see the quality of photos and videos degrade.  I was especially excited that this Olympus had high-def video too!  I was all in!  Then next day I saw it here at Amaazon for bout 40 bucks cheaper (inclusive).  I quickly canned the wait list and grabbed it here at Amazon. In hindsight  I wish I had shelled out the extra 40 for the option of an easy return.  The seller I got it from here charges a restocking fee, opps...my bad.  I'm not one to just give away money like that so I keep it.No major complaints about the camera but after having a compact point and shoot this bulky \"slr style\" is well...cramping my style.  Where am I gonna put it in my purse?  And a camera bag? That's so \"90's\" lol.Yes the video capabilities is improved (which I like)!  The wind noise is extreme outdoors however.  The zoom is pretty amazing (when I keep it steady).  The regular photos are a crap shoot, sometime good sometime not, even with flash up it is spotty.  For these reasons I think I would just be happier with a compact \"point and shoot style camera\" with HD video.  In fact less than a week later ANOTHER t.v. retailer was pushing one 100 dolla cheaper than the olympus and it was cuter too but I'm stuck with what I have.  Maybe I'm just a commitment phob...Oh well's either way I still have a good camera, just have to take the time to get the settings right (translation-read manuel) and get used to lugging it around.

The controller that should move the lens has stopped working. It still takes pictures and videos, which I will use it for now but for ordinary photography I will have to buy a new one.

I have an e-mail into tech support but being the weekend I have yet to hear back from them.  Also I have had problems with the conflict of settings message.

Will never buy Olympus again.I watched the QVC promotion at just a couple dollars less than Amazon, but had to add shipping, so looked here on Amazon and with prime shipping (free) the price was about $3 higher than QVC, but less in final total.My first fancy camera 16 years ago, bought in Hong Kong, was Olympus, used it for years, back in the days of 35 mm, thousands of pictures.I've gone up in features and down in price since then, with many digital cameras.Now they are so cheap that the low cost is as bad as the low value.This Olympus?  It will take, like always, hundreds of hours of study to do all that stuff, and I'll write another review after I've used it for a month or so.I've recently bought three video cameras at Amazon, threw two away, using my Flip which I like, but this Olympus puts me in a bigger league for movies than I've =been in.I bought and returned several video editing programs, all much too fancy, finally got a early version, Adobe Premier Pro 1.5 and it is finally simple enough to learn for an 80 year old guy.So I've put my first title on a video now, published it on Vimeo, with the Olympus and that simple editing program I'll have a ball.More later.The four stars are prospective conservative.

The \"benefits of registration\" were impossible to read. The final launch of the software presented an almost completely black screen with tiny amount of vague gray words and menu items that could not be read. This seems to be popular currently.
