{"Reviews": [{"Title": "most fun spy camera ever", "Author": "christine freeland", "ReviewID": "R3A9XFFE3J23R1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I cant remember the last time I this much fun with a new camera.  It's a cat!  The lens is in the cat's left eye where no one would expect to find it, so candid photos are super easy to take.  Plus, it's just fun to point a cat at the world.  I also like that there is no digital display which means you have no idea what you have captured until you get home and connect to your computer or tv.  I gave it a 4 star rating because the camera itself is not that amazing.  I posted a few of my test photos here on amazon.Here are some things you should know that are not in the product description:1. you will need to get your own microSD card.2. photos in Hi Res quality are: 2048 x 1536 (750 KB +/- per photo).  Lo Res is 1024 x 7683. camera has many modes - still photo, movie with sound, self portrait timer, and unlimited photos once per second (there is a indicator light which changes color based on mode. kind of tricky to remember - manual comes with a nice chart)4. camera can be in color or black and white.5. cat paws are magnets so you can easy stick the camera on something metal to do self portrait or take a photo a second and watch the world go by.  fun!6. power cord, usb cord and tv connection cables are included in box.  internal battery takes about an hour to charge in full. lasts several days.7. for best photos - take them in natural daylight and stand still when pushing shutter8. because of magnet feet, be careful throwing it in your purse or bag, as it might wipe your credit cards or other magnet strips clear.So there it is, you'll be purchasing this for fun and novelty, not so much on great camera qualities.  I think $150 is too much for what you get, but that's not stopping me from keeping it on hand to shoot photos daily.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "This camera is just for fun! Just cute fun.", "Author": "Joycedevivre", "ReviewID": "R2BG1QJ37V8HSJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Please read christine freeland's review for some good specifics. This review is for the Lisa Larson orange striped cat camera. They also have it in solid black and solid white but what's the fun in that? I saw this in an UO catalog and Amazon had it for $40 cheaper so I had to check it out. Something I'd like to stress is that you need a *MICRO* sd card. This is the size for cel phones and not the regular sd cards for like the wii or a lot of canon point and shoots. They recommend that you devote a MICROcard to this camera so if you don't already have one please add it to your order so you can use the camera right away. Also, after popping the card in and out of the camera like 6 times it seems to be stuck in there so there you go.This camera is adorable. It makes me smile just to see it. It is also tiny--around the size of a half deck of cards and plastic so it's light. It's easy to throw in your pocket but also tiny/ light enough that it's easy to misplace.So 5 stars for the camera being  super cute. The camera's  performance though is pretty lacking so for that it's a 2 (why I'm giving it 3 stars). We've called this the \"box of chocolates\" because you never know what you're going to get. What looks like a teeny view finder is really just the light that tells you what mode the camera is in so you'll need to practice to get your shots centered. The shutter speed is really slow so forget anything that even vaguely moves on camera mode. Even when you and your subject stand as still as you can the pictures are never sharp. The colors come out garish and are often either very over- or very under-exposed. There is no display window unless you want to shell out an additional $150 for the monitor ground (which then makes this just for fun camera nearly $300 and for that you can actually get a really nice point and shoot) so you never know what you captured. Did they blink? Who knows. Is it too dark? Again, who knows. So it's kind of fun to upload the pictures to see what you get if it's not for an important event. Out of 50 images I thought one was good but they were all at least interesting to look at.I have not tried the black and white or rapid fire mode. The video mode surprisingly captures audio. While the colors are as off as if you were just in camera mode, if you have a movie editor you might have better luck clipping out a good shot than trying to take a still one. That said, I'm still taking it out every day to take random shots just to see what I might get.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$92.95", "Features": null, "Name": "Superheadz Necono Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ZVt9j8cPL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004R0NKSS"}}
