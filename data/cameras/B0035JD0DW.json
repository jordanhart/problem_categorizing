{"Reviews": [{"Title": "DSLR features, point and shoot price", "Author": "J. Harley", "ReviewID": "R1D52TVTHT4FU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Fuji S1800 is a a nice tweener, filling the gap between pocket point-and-shoot cameras and a DSLR.  It's larger than typical point and shoot cameras (thanks to the 18X zoom lens) yet smaller than a DSLR. Despite the extra bulk, the S1800 is light and compact enough  to carry around for extended periods. The plastic body is sturdy and light.  The camera is powered by four AA batteries (alkaline or rechargeable).  All of the controls are very well placed and settings are easy to locate.  The top dial allows for quick switching between automatic, manual, aperture priority, shutter priority, or programmed scene shooting modes.  There is a button on the back for switching between the LCD or the electronic viewfinder.  The flash performs well and has a slow sync feature.  There is no input for an external flash (or any other accessories other than a tripod). Shooting with the S1800 is a joy.  Although it's best to learn how to make the most of this camera's capabilities, even full-auto mode can produce excellent results.  The 18X zoom lens has great range and good quality from wide angle to telephoto.  In one particular shot, I photographed a medicine bottle approximately 15 feet away in dim lighting. I had no problem reading the smallest print on the bottle in the image.  Auto mode isn't perfect (just like every other camera out there) and there were some occasional focusing and exposure issues, but overall, I took more good pictures than bad, even in challenging lighting.  Some of the features, like blink and smile detection, seem to be more of a gimmick than actually useful. Blink detection seems to randomly pop up at will, even if there are no people in the picture.  Blink and smile detection aside, the S1800 does have several features that are really useful, such as a burst mode (several rapid photos taken in succession), facial recognition, zoom bracketing (several pictures taken at varying focal lengths), and more.  The S1800 is so user-friendly, these features are useful for beginners and experienced alike.  The S1800 lacks a raw mode.  In-camera compression is usually spot-on, but I had a few shots where it went all in, resulting in soft shots.  Overall image quality was very good, with the S1800 holding its own against several of my more expensive cameras.  Although my Canon XSi is still the champ of my household, the Fuji compared well to my Canon G10. I tried several different SD and SDHC cards in the Fuji. It recognized every card except one, an ancient 8MB generic SD card that came bundled with a camera I purchased nearly a decade ago.  It did recognize a newer generic 32MB SD card that also came bundled with a camera.Video mode is okay but nothing great. Videos are stored in AVI format.  HD mode is pretty good compared to the standard resolution but doesn't come close to the performance of a Flip or dedicated HD video camera. You can zoom during filming, but the zoom motor creates a noticable buzzing noise in the video.  It's not even the same sound heard when actively zooming the camera.  About the best way I can describe it is similar to the sound made by a hand buzzer.The large LCD display is decent when shooting in good light and during media playback but it's a little noisy when shooting in reduced lighting.The Fuji offers DSLR image quality and features for the price of a higher-end point and shoot.  It has a few minor flaws, but considering everything Fuji packed into this camera for the price, you can't go wrong.  It's a perfect step-up if you're eager to explore the realm beyond basic point-and-shoot but not quite ready to take the plunge into DSLR territory.", "Date": "March 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "S1800 Boom or bust", "Author": "MiannaJo", "ReviewID": "R1WCHXZVMGDVOU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the 1800 after seeing a HSN demo on the camera. First, I must be honest by stating I am a retired journalist who shot her own photos, and a long time Nikon owner and more recently a digital Canon SLR owner. I still shoot and sell my work, mostly scenery and automotive photos.The camera interested me because I was looking for a great camera, small enough to fit in my handbag. What the S1800 offered was a pretty good camera, not real great, but really nice. My beef is there is no RAW capabilities, but I guess that was to be expected at that price. Unlike above reviews, I think it is a battery hog and unlike my Canon, I can't plug the battery into the wall socket overnight. I purchased this camera because HSN really pushed the video. Eh, not so great. If you want great videos break down and buy a dedicated video camera. The video capability is good though if you chance upon a rare opportunity to shoot something. A lot of shake with the video. Finally, the lens cap wants to fall off all the time giving way to a possible lens damage while toting it in my handbag.Now the plus side. It shoots a great image, especially in the wide lens mode. Great panorama when you need it. The camera is way above the little boxy point and shoots for stabilization because of the hand grip style. The telephoto is as good as you are going to get in a non SLR. I compared it side by side with my Canon's lens and it gives the lens a run for its money, but I also must agree a tripod is almost a must for the long shots. After you learn all the whistles and buttons you will have a pretty nice camera for the price. Half of the features could be eliminated like blink and smile, but it is likely a consumer driven factor.All in all I gave it four stars. For my professional work, I will of course stay with my trusty Nikon film and Canon digital SLR, but for a fun camera with compact features--go for it.I have recommended it to all my point and shoot friends as a step up camera", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "A lot of camera for your money.", "Author": "Ralph C. Browne", "ReviewID": "R2KFOXLXGEWBEG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you are one of those digital camera users who want some of the high end features of an SLR without the big price tag this might be right for you.  It is so new hardly anyone knows it is slowly coming out on the market.  Got mine at a special launch on HSN.  Though there have been mixed reviews as to how good it is I don't have any complaints.  Like zoom capability?  The Fuji S-18 has as much as anyone practically needs.  My only knock is you have use a tripod when using full zoom power unless you have a steady hand.  The super Macro feature is great too if you like getting things really close up.  Amazing resolution overall.  The 3 inch LCD is nice but like all LCDs is hampered in bright light conditions, super sunny days.  Thats where the good old Standard View finder comes in handy.  It is better than most and works great in all conditions, even if you have wear glasses like me.  Indoors or on less sunny days the LCD is just fine.  There are a lot of really great features that are easy to use and figure out even if you don't ever read the operation manual you can upload on to your computer.  Good all around product if you are looking for an upgrade or even a first time buyer.  At the price point it sells for you get a lot of camera for a very good price.  Though it uses AA batteries, alchaline or rechargables, and they seem to last a long time.  Got a great little battery from Amazon that brings your batteries back to life in almost no time at home or on the road. You don't have to worry about fidling around with your camera settings and killing your batteries befor you take a picture....like me.  Check it out.  Nice camera based on Fugi's S-15 with a couple of extras thrown in.

From the time I opened the box, read the manual, took some test shots and was viewing them on my computer (I didn't install the supplied cd for picture viewing direct from the camera) approx 30 minutes went by.Camera setup is a breeze. The manual is very easy to follow with clear instructions. For my test shots on my initial use I used the \"AUTO\" Setting. There are four other picture taking settings- Scene Recognition Auto, Scene Position, Panorama, Custom.  Additionally there is Movie mode where you can record HD movies in 720p quality.The SD Card and 4 AA Battery's go in the same compartment on the bottom of the camera. I prefer having the AA's as there have been many a times that my original and spare batteries have run out and I wished my camera took  AA's.The camera's \"menu\" is easily navigable and is not overly complicated.You have the option of viewing your subject prior to and after the shot thru the view finder or the 3.5 inch display. The ability to review your pictures and zoom,shift, etc is present as well.Intelligent Face Detection,Red- Eye Removal and Blink Detection worked flawlessly for me in sunlight, indoors in normal lighting, and lower light conditions inside and out.One of my favorite features of this camera is the Burst Mode (Continuous Shooting)-There are 5 different Burst Mode options which I know I will get a ton of use out of during the kids sports season coming up.The 18X Zoom is outstanding. I have photographed subjects that I thought I would need the Hubble for and I have been very pleased with my results.As far as performance in the \"field\" goes the camera is about half the size of other SLR Camera's like the Nikon D40 so that helps on weight. I didn't experience any software \"hic-ups\" when changing between settings and switching rapidly from mode to mode etc.  I took approx 300 pictures with the settings on the highest resolution possible. The battery usage is good as I still have the original ones in and haven't received and low power notifications.To sum up my experience this 12.2 Megapixel S1800 Camera from Fuji Film is a camera that a novice or a professional would be happy with. There are very detailed ISO setting's and shutters speeds that can be manipulated and a boatload of different \"scene\" selections such as fireworks,sunset,snow,beach,party,flower,night,etc,etc.  The plethora of simple yet advanced features can turn anyone into a true \"shutterbug\".", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Decent Camera, Good Value", "Author": "K. Salinger \"FNP, RN\"", "ReviewID": "R286AQOL74W7YR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My husband was surprised by how small and light this camera was when he took it out of the box. For some this might be a positive, but he found it a little small to hold comfortably in his hands and with not enough weight for it to feel steady. He was looking for an alternative camera to his Canon Powershot point-and-shoot camera which he uses for vacations... basically a home use camera that he didn't have to worry about putting in his pocket. So he wasn't worried about size and weight issues and he personally prefers a camera with a little more bulk to it. However, for someone looking for a more powerful camera than a point-and-shoot as their primary camera for vacations and while on the road, the size and weight would definitely be a positive.The camera is very easy to use and takes excellent pictures. The optical zoom is excellent (much better than the digital zoom quality you get when trying to zoom in closely with a point and shoot). There are tons of features and he still hasn't tried them all, but as others have mentioned, the blink detection doesn't seem to work very well. He was taking pictures of our daughter and it didn't notify him on several occasions when he could clearly see she blinked in the viewfinder. Also, the video mode was lacking the quality he gets when taking videos on our Flip Video Camera (highly recommend that by the way), so don't get this thinking you can take quality pictures and videos all in one package. His only other gripe was that the dial to change modes seemed to easily get bumped out of the mode he intended to be in.Despite my complaints, overall this is a decent camera that takes great pictures. Although I'm certain there are better cameras out there similar to this, for the price this is a good value.", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "An excellent choice for the price", "Author": "T. Kunikov", "ReviewID": "R6MF1MF1NDNWD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been looking for a camera for months now, so when given the opportunity to review this Fujifilm FinePix S1800, I jumped at the chance.  As with any product, there are good and bad aspects to the camera.  The real and final question will always come down to whether the good outweighs the bad.  In this case, I would say you definitely get your money's worth, and then some.First thing you will notice about this camera is that it is LIGHT and small!  Then, you'll be amazed by the zoom!  Definitely two large pluses for someone who doesn't enjoy lugging around heavy cameras for their zoom capabilities.Having said that, and having used SLRs in the past, as well as regular point-and-shoot digital cameras, I knew that I wanted my next camera to not have that 'lag' between the time I hit the shutter and when the picture is finally taken.  I don't want to wait around 2 or 3 seconds (which seems like not a long time, but even so, it's annoyingly long when you're trying to hold up a camera and pray that you won't move it by accident) for the picture to be taken only to find out something went wrong.  With SLRs it's instant and that's what I was looking for.  With the FinePix S1800, it's almost instant, and considering this is about half the price of the cheapest SLR that I would get (a Canon rebel), that's perfect for me.I have to agree that the digital display on the camera is a bit 'grainy', I have found this mainly on point-and-shoot cameras, not on SLRs.  In the end the quality is good but not at the level of a more professional (and more expensive) camera.  Then again, you have a lot of options with which to make it a better picture, and depending on lighting, exposure, etc., you might get exactly what you want.  But leaving it on auto will not produce the same type of picture, quality wise, as an SLR on the same setting.  In the end, for 230 dollars, you definitely get a good quality camera and one that non-professionals can at least experiment with and enjoy.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good for the price", "Author": "DAN", "ReviewID": "R1SG3DPO4ZWH61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera mostly for the zoom and the quality of the lens you get for only around 200 bucks. This camera does not have a RAW mode so it's really a point and shoot BUT it has many different features you might find in professional SLR cameras that cost hundreds more. If you know what you're doing, you can do a lot of manual shooting. I'm not going to give it a 2,3,4 out 5 because I don't' like the cheap plastic feel or that it's too light or that I don't like the color, like some of the other reviewers mentioned.. How cares??? I give it 5 stars because the quality of the pictures is great and for what this camera is designed for, it does beautifully.", "Date": "April 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Really Good Camera For the Money", "Author": "The Kodachrome Kid", "ReviewID": "R2UZGLN8LOHPMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using my Finepix S1800 for almost two weeks now, and I have to say that I'm truly impressed.  Although Amazon's not going to like this, I didn't buy it from them. I bought mine from a competitor at a lower price... Mine was reconditioned by Fuji, and came with no neckstrap, lens cap, or batteries. If you buy it new, you get those items. Anyway, I got this camera because I couldn't afford a Nikon D5000.  I'd been using my film cameras, as well as a digital Olympus C-700, and felt it was time to get something better than the old Olympus.  This Finepix fit the bill.  It functions flawlessly, the lens seems pretty good, and the software menus within the camera are a breeze to master.  The only gripe I have with the camera is that it doesn't do RAW format..  I can live without it.  The images I've shot are sharp at all focal lengths, and the low light capabilities, especially the built-in Infrared AF, are pretty good, too.  Oh, yeah, probably the most exciting feature of this camera is the Dual Image Stabilization.  It has allowed me to get tack sharp shots at shutter speeds that would be impossible to get with a 35mm SLR.  I've shot handheld shots at well over 200mm focal length at 1\" and even slower!  It's just amazing to rack the zoom all the way out to the equivalent of 504mm, and shoot at 1/60\", even 1/30\", and know you can get the shot.  Just astounding.  IT WORKS.  It's wonderful in macro mode, too.  Although undoubtedly there are better digital superzoom bridge cameras out there on the market, I seriously doubt if any come close to the S1800 in terms of value.  The camera is inexpensive, well-made, handles well, and is fun to use.  It's a nice machine.  Oh, one caveat - it's REALLY fussy about the memory cards it can take - SanDisk and Fuji SDHC cards are recommended.  The cards MUST BE CLASS 6 TO WORK WITH THIS CAMERA!  Do not try to use a regular SD card, or anything less than a Class 6 card.  I picked up an 8GB Fujifilms SDHC card for around $30 that gives me over 1,700 shots at the S1800's largest, best image quality - I can live with that.To sum up -- get this camera.", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fine Unit for Money", "Author": "Gregory C. Van Eeckhout \"fish&hunt;\"", "ReviewID": "RPMCVIW6G52XA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Only had the camera a month, but it is doing well with many tasks.  a couple of initial thoughts: The built in panoramic feature works well and so you do not have to take 3 individual pictures and create the image on the computer, although you can only use 3 images for the panorama so if you want more images you might still have to use a computer program to mesh images.The burst image taking mode, is still not all that quick for catching a faster moving object (ie like my dog) and I may be able to improve this by a bit more experimentation.  a negative is they only included a printed version of the basic, simple instruction manual and had to print out the detailed manual off the website.  Seems to be quite good on batteries, I am using NIMH rechargeables and getting lots of time out of them (sorry no precise measurement, but its good)  Electronic viewfinder is decent and so if you really needed to conserve batteries operating without the large display is sure possible.  Optical zoom seems great, and like the fact that you have to over-ride the default settings in order to use any digital zoom, which should keep friends of mine from over zooming and wrecking a photo by going into digital zoom. HD video seems to work fine and appears pretty good,as noted by others you can hear the zooming of the lens as you are shooting, not a big deal if like me you plan to set some of the footage to music.

Compared to the Nikon its obvious the quality on the L100 is superior. The zoom is almost identical L100=15x vs the s1800=18x which is strange to say the least. Wide angle shots are about the same, I have taken and compared pictures with both cameras. The S1800 has an enormous advantage over the L100, and it is that you get control over many settings. If the L100 had that it would be an awesome camera. I have been a point and shooter but now I am reading and learning about manual settings. And that is why this camera is great, its a great bridge camera to learn. Never had a dSLR but I know my next camera will be one. Meanwhile I am learning on this one and getting ready to move onto a dSLR in the near future. At its price point this camera is an affordable step towards the dSLR world or simply a step towards better pictures. I dislike the fact that memory card and batteries share a compartment. This may be done to keep someone from yanking the card out while the camera is still writing to it. I don't use the packaged software I put the memory card in my reader and transfer pictures, its much faster that way. Auto focus gets a little confused at times but I reposition and its all good. Video is okay but is not good, this is a camera with video function not a camcorder. If you want video buy a camcorder, if you want to take pictures and take video clips then you should be fine with this.

I compared this camera with the Nikon Coolpix L110 and the Panasonic Luminix DMC-FZ35, along with several other models.  I'm not a professional, so I just wanted a camera that was easy to use with a larger zoom.The Panasonic stood out with the best features and picture quality.  It was also nearly twice the price of the Fujifilm and had a smaller LCD screen.  The Nikon did not have an optical viewfinder, which I really appreciate in direct sunlight.This camera is loaded with other features like manual settings that you will not find unless you go to the higher priced cameras.  It is very easy to use, even without reading the manual.  The controls are well positioned, and the more I use it, the more I find out that it will do.After having the camera for a week and shooting about 100 pictures, I was still undecided about keeping the camera.  I loved all of the features and the price is fantastic for what you get.  The problem was that many of my pictures were blurred.  Some of them were excellent, so I kept using it for another week.  At that point, I decided that all of the great features were not worth the number of blurred pictures.  I decided to give it one last try, and I went outside to shoot a few more with maximum zoom.  I was surprised an how many came out perfect at that range.  That is when I realized how slow the focus is.  I was used to my old Kodak point-and-shoot which had limited range and seemed to focus quickly.  With this camera, you have to press the button half way down to focus before you snap the picture.Like I said, I am not a professional (or even a good amateur).  Now that I have that figured out, all of my pictures are clear, even at maximum zoom.  I'm really happy I didn't send it back.  I like having AA batteries and they last a long time between charges.  The camera is light and fairly compact.The reason I gave it 5 stars is because there is nothing close to it in this price range with the features and quality.  It is not as good as the Panasonic or some of the other other higher priced cameras, but that would be comparing apples to oranges.", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera, I'll leave the tech talk to the professionals though", "Author": "J.

My most recent Canon, the 10mp SD something or other Coach edition - purchased for over $500 4 yrs ago, finally broke (lens error of some sort) and was over $200 to repair. So off I went to find another option.I stumbled upon this camera by accident, wasnt looking for a Fuji, after all I'm a Canon person, lol. But this model was mentioned on so many different sites I had to check it out.This little camera is super easy to use. I have 3 kids, an 8yr old and twin (almost) 5 yr olds who are all starting sports this fall. My favorite feature of the camera is the \"burst\" mode. You have the option of taking 20, 10, or 3 high speed shots with one press of the shutter. I tested it out by asking my daughter to jump and spin in a circle. She did, I used the 20 shot, and I captured liftoff to touch down. Super cool.The panoramic mode is cool too, it allows you to take 3 pictures in a row (like a mountain range or whatever) and it takes the 3 shots and \"stitches\" them together right in the camera. Saves you the work of editing later if thats your cup of tea. I cant be bothered with anything more than cropping or whatever, might go crazy and turn one black and white...and oh, this camera does that too.The zoom was a big draw for me. My old Canon had a zoom that was less than impressive, but this Fuji is pretty powerful. It does take a steady hand to be fully extended and snap a clear shot without a tripod, but after a few test shots I was able to take some pretty crisp images.I have to be honest and say I am no professional to speak intelligently about aperature or F speed. I took a photo class in high school, but that was more than 15 years ago. You'd be better off asking me how to speak French, since I supposedly learned that too..Anyway, the price is right, the camera is lightweight and comes with a neck/shoulder strap. Only complaint is that the lens cap falls off mine.I would recommend this camera, especially to parents looking to get the capabilities (or some of them, at least) of a DSLR but know their kids will just ruin the $700 base model without a lens and decide to hold off for a less expensive model until the kids can distinguish between mommy's camera and the play cell phone they throw across the room.

Key phrase: \"FOR THE MONEY\".The camera has some nice features and is really easy to use.  It felt comfortable in my hands and the battery life was great compared to some other inexpensive cameras I've owned.  The battery/lense cover are cheapies.  One wrong move and you could easily render this camera useless if you break the battery door.So - aside from the cheap parts (what do you expect out of a $170 camera?) let's talk about picture quality.  I will start by saying I do not consider myself an advanced photographer.  Maybe I could have played around with the aperture and shutter speeds a little more to get better photos but who knows?  I primarily take pictures of cars - sitting still.  Most of the pictures I would shoot would come out a little blurry.  This is a problem for me.  I was able to get SOME decent snaps but majority of them would come out a little fuzzy.Also, the camera would sometimes power down randomly and would also freeze up occasionally.Now - before I ever purchased the camera I was in a stand still over which camera to buy:  Fujifilm s1800 OR Nikon L110.  I went ahead and purchased the Fuji because of the cheaper price.  Little did I know, one of my close friends actually owns the Nikon L110.  After playing around with it for a bit I decided I needed to send the Fuji back and get the Nikon.  The camera feels so much more sturdy and also takes much better pictures not to mention the lCD is actually clear and not grainy.All in all - take a trip to Target and test the two cameras out prior to purchasing.

I want to learn photography possibly up to a semi-professional level  but I didn't want/ didn't have  the money to commit to a full blown DSLR  so when shopping around I encountered the s1800 and its brother the 2550? which has an hdml connector.  it had many features I was looking for  good pixel size,  built in zoom,  even some video capability  weighing the features and the limitations I decited to buy the S1800....in the box was the camera (its slightly smaller and lighter than I expected but im old school when it comes to 35mm and its just good enough not to have a \"cheap feel\")  it came with 4xAA batts,  an inexpensive strap, a unimpressive lens cap,, and a USB cable,,  and like 3 basic manuals in different languages and a CD with some softwear and advanced manual  i havent installed yet. the support was a cardboard eggcarton configuration.I took the camera out  and played with it knowing little about digital camera operation but was still able to figure out basic operations without a problem.my first shot was a dragonfly on a branch  from 6feet away in daylight  and I have to say the results were a plesant suprise as there were some reports that it was blury at high zoom and I found the camera to be respectably stable (I did have a mini tripod attached for added stability but wasnt ground placed) the shot had the dragon fly in crisp focused detail. (im using one of the lower picture resolutions the 2mb on fine  it translates to about a 500k pic.my next attempt was some star shots  and while I was able to shoot the intended star I failed to get anything like a starry night pic  but it may have been my failure and I need to be more agressive with the configurations, (on a side note  the eyepiece crosshair functioned like a hud scope  and by placing my eye a few inches back from the eye piece and looking with both eyes  I was able to target a selected star to get it in frame even at full zoom)my third test was falling water I set this on the sport setting but was unable in a few frames to get frozen falling water  I need to do more research as I believe this camera is capable of it.my final is a sunset (there is a sunset specialty setting)  even in my crappy ugly location ,just goofing off I took a photo that has gotten a wow responce several times from friends.FINAL NONES  a 4gb chip will hold like 6000+ of the low resolution pictures (500k)  this is a very versitile camera for the money and I think it would find a place as a support or backup camera even if I had the big bucks  would like to see RAW format,  thumb drive support, filter threads, and exterior hookup ports for flash and mic and shutter.APRIL 02 2011 something new I encountered is the camera essencially only has 2 F stop settings  you can zoom to  bend to others up to F11  as I understand it a full DSLR has direct access to  7-10 f stops", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm FinePix S1800 camera", "Author": "Jan", "ReviewID": "R33GYILXIJWJMC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been extremely happy with this camera.

I currently have a Canon Rebel XSi and when I took both cameras to a nature preserve, I felt the Fujifilm camera took better pictures outdoors on a beautiful sunny day. I have been very pleased with the supermacro pictures as well. The zoom works great for taking pictures of birds in trees too. The camera is extremely light-weight and small. It is perfect for hiking or biking when you don't want to drag on a big camera and lenses. I preferred my Canon camera for taking pictures at my neices wedding indoors.

Granted I have only had it for a few days but I love it! I consider myself a novice in training, so some features of this camera I am still struggling with, such as setting shutter speed and aperture. I don't even know what aperture is right now, but I am learning. I have used the SP mode, panorama mode and video mode but so far I stick to the auto mode till I learn more. The zoom is incredible on this camera, I took a picture from over a block away and it was crystal clear like I was standing there! The sport setting on the SP mode is awesome as well, I finally was able to get pictures of my cat/dog playing and running around. The clarity of the pictures is way better then my point and shoot as well as audio playback. I love the fact that you can switch(with the push of a button) from LED screen to electronic view finder for that traditional camera feel. It was way lighter then I expected but I don't mind that. It came packaged in its box (disks, manuals, lens cap, padded shoulder strap, batteries and av/usb cords) that was packed in another box with plenty of packing supplies to keep it from moving about.I am still learning so this is the best review I can give right now.

The deal breaker is the price/value - for a camera like this with these features, you won't find anything for this price. This was the ultimate deciding factor. I needed a camera just for a month's worth of vacation (9 different locations), and didn't want to risk losing/damaging something high-price that was just for the trip.2. Love these type of cameras in general - the best of both worlds: smaller and lighter than a true DSLR, but with the same (if not better than) telephoto and wide-angle aspects; more functions than simple point-and-shoots, faster focus and actual shooting times, and faster recycling times (time between shots).3. For the price, the added 720p video functionality is awesome. Video is quite good, and the auto- focus and iris functions are quick.4. Panorama function - I'm not big on gimmicks, and haven't tried panorama features of other cameras, but this one is excellent. The stitching is nearly flawless - there is a \"ghost\" image which pops up on the left side of the screen so you can line up your 2nd and 3rd shots - very neat.5. Uses 4 AA batteries so you can always replace them (at souvenir shops, etc.) when caught in a bind.CONS:1. Average photo quality. At this price this is to be expected, but just want to let you know. Use the \"Landscape\" mode to bring the most out of your photos if you're using this on a vacation.2. It's the best of both worlds, and it's the worst of both worlds: doesn't have all the high-tech features and qualities of true DSLRs; slow start-up time; is too big to put in your pockets.3. Audio on video recording is absolutely horrendous. It's monaural, and if it's not someone standing and speaking right in front of the camera, all you get is audio rubble.4. AA batteries can also mean a bad thing. If you are a knucklehead like me and forgot to bring rechargeables or a bag full of replacement AA's, your battery bill can be almost as high as the camera itself. I was on vacation in various parts of Asia for a month, and even there where everything is dirt cheap, 4 AA's cost anywhere from $5-10 at the souvenir shops. I went through at least 7 sets - some didn't even last a day!In the end I highly recommend this camera, because of its value. I got it when it was a \"buck-sixty,\" and even then I thought it was a steal. Some junk point-and-shoot cameras don't cost this low.If you can accept its limitations, GET this camera!And GET rechargeable AA batteries!", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera.

First off, the quality of photos with moving subjects is very poor, even when on sport mode and using a tripod.  Also, ordinary photos are pretty good, but still are a little fuzzy.  It seems the only time a clear photo can be taken is when you are outside in the sun taking a picture of a still subject.  You cannot be in artificial lighting, be in the dark, or have a moving subject and still get clear shots.  I have read the book and messed with the settings, and nothing fixes the quality of photo.  When taking pictures of something black or in a dark room, the LCD screen shows a blue fuzzy color instead of black but on the photo it shows up black.

The best photos are those taken with the subject in bright sunlight at ISO 64, the aperture set at f/3.1, and the color balance set at \"fine\".It is worthwhile to work your way through the 140 page owner's manual page by page.

The S1800 can produce mediocre or poor results in its \"auto\" modes, but it can produce professional quality photos when you take control yourself.I've found some \"quirks\" with the S1800. The owner's manual warns about problems caused by hot temperatures, including purple bands across the photos.  And, when temperatures in Texas go above about 90 degrees, some photos of my photos have been ruined by purple banding.  But the S1800 also loses its ability to focus in very hot weather. And, it loses its ability to focus when the batteries get hot...such as when you take 20 or 30 photos in just five or six minutes.NOTE:  The Fujifilm S1880, S2500 and S2550 are essentially the same camera.

Mchugh \"animalfriend\"", "ReviewID": "RTWZL4JNEYKF6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received my S1800 four days ago, so while I may not be \"qualified\" to review it based on extended use, I did take several hundred shots over the weekend \"trying\" to make myself like this camera.A bit of background first because I think it influences my review. My first digital camera was an Olympus 5060 and I loved everything about it. However, after several years and thousands of great photos, it started having \"electronic\" issues - the camera would start cycling random settings and the only way to stop would be to shut it off - sometimes that worked for a week, other times it didn't work at all. I wanted a camera with a better zoom anyway, so I upgraded to a Sony DSC H5 with a 12X optical zoom. I wasn't as happy with the Sony, but it was still a decent camera that took good pictures. It recently started having some problems common to the model (LCD viewfinder went white first, but the camera was still useful) and then the shutter button broke (a very common problem with this camera). While I just ordered my second shutter button (some people have replaced them 3-4 times), I thought it might be a good excuse to buy another camera. Hence my search...I love the zoom on my Sony, so that was an important consideration. I narrowed it down to a few models, including a Canon, Panasonic, and this Fuji. The Fuji stood out because of the price, so I thought I'd give it a try. I paid $500+ for each of my previous cameras and since technology advances so rapidly, I thought a less expensive new model would surpass my older ones. I was wrong and was disappointed in the Fuji.I mention my background because I think for someone who's upgrading from a cheap point-and-shoot, they'd be pleased with the S1800. But if you've already had even a mid-level digital camera (I know my previous cameras are far from top-of-the-line), I think you'll be disappointed in it's performance (i.e. focus time); options (everything from limited image size to the lack of \"scene\" choices), and results (clarity and color of the photos).Again, to be fair, I only used this camera for a few days and perhaps with more time, I may have had better results.The S1800 does have some good features: the zoom is incredible (but the resulting photos are fuzzy at full zoom even when using a tripod); it's relatively easy to use; the shutter lag is almost nonexistent ONCE IT'S IN FOCUS (very important because that's one of the key reasons I'm returning it - it takes too long to focus in some situations); and it's very inexpensive (for what you get). I didn't have any problems with the \"feel\" of the camera, as some other reviews stated. It definitely feels more \"cheap\" than my old Olympus 5060, but it compares to my Sony DSC H5 - which was a much more expensive camera to buy.One of the problems I experienced was the focus time. I use my camera to take a lot of pictures of my pets. This camera lags far behind my Olympus and Sony in the focus time. There were some shots that were delayed by at least 2 seconds. This may not seem like much time, but when you're trying to capture \"a moment,\" it's lost. The test shots I'm comparing were all taken outside in natural daylight. My Olympus is almost instant and while the Sony has a slight lag, it's not as long as the Fuji. Another issue with the focus is that more often than not, even taking it's sweet old time, the results were out of focus anyway.Also along the lines of focus, while the zoom drew me to the camera, I was disappointed with the results. I haven't been blown away by the quality of my Sony pics at 12X either, so this may be an issue with digital cameras. I'm comparing them to photos I used to take with my 35mm telephoto lenses. But still, the S1800 was not of the quality I achieve with my Sony. And this was using a tripod for zoom shots.The color: When I loaded my first few shots, the color didn't seem as vibrant as it should be, so I took some identical test shots with both the Fuji and the Sony. Without getting into manual settings on either camera - just factory default automatic everything - the Sony far outperformed the Fuji in color. The Fuji's colors were much more muted by comparison. Perhaps this could be overcome by changing the settings - I don't know. But my quick comparison showed definite inferior color.Another thing I didn't care for was the inability to select from \"quick scenes\" that's common to most digital cameras. The Fuji has a setting where it selects for you, but you can't do so manually (as I can with both other cameras). This may not be a big issue for those who prefer manual settings, but if you want some control over \"quick/automatic\" settings, it's a feature I think you'll miss.Perhaps I missed it, but I couldn't find any option for photos less than 2MB. This is a rather large file size if you're taking pictures for email, to list items on Craigslist, or other applications where you want a small file size. The Sony and especially the Olympus allow much greater control over the size and quality of the photos. They Olympus is more complex (but allows for small file size) and the Sony has a setting specifically for \"email\" photos. Again - maybe there is such an option on the Fuji that I didn't see - but \"standard\" selections only go down to 2MB size - and since it doesn't come with any memory card, I was constantly running the camera back to my computer to transfer the pictures.And finally, while this may not be the case for everyone, I found it uncomfortable to hold after a while. I have small hands, so this may have contributed - and I didn't affix the neckstrap, so I was holding it the entire time I was using it (which was a lot because I was trying to evaluate it).Overall, I wasn't impressed and I'll be returning it. As I mentioned, if you're only experience is with a \"pocket\" point and shoot, I think you may be pleased - especially for the price. But if you've enjoyed a little \"better\" camera in the past, I think you'd be more satisfied in spending a bit more on a different model.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "beware fujifilm warranty!!", "Author": "Ms. Stacie A.

As an appraiser, I needed a good camera, and I thought the Fuji 1800s would be good, especially with the 18x optical zoom, the price, and the HD video. The reality is that this camera does not take good photos (on any mode that I have tried), does not have good video (really that is HD?), has significant shutter lag, a grainy lcd screen, and an annoying battery compartment that you have to open in order to access the SD card (all 4 aa batteries will pop out). Also, the battery meter is hard to access and my new aa energizer rechargeables would act like they were dead and then the camera would work again-weird. I tried this camera for a few weeks and really wanted to like it, but today it is being returned as I think an \"in between\" dslr and point and shoot camera, while in theory may sound good, I would rather get a full dslr and spend a few more bucks. I am not trying to be harsh to Fuji, and it seems the 18x zoom is the real good feature of this camera, but everything else is hard to like.

The flash works well though you must push a button to pop it up. No motor to break I guess. Overall, it is an ok rig. My old fuji f10 takes better pics and is quicker to focus, but has 3x optical and uses xd cards. If zoom is king overall and you are not a pic quality nut this is a good value at 150 or less.

We prefer not to spend a lot of money for a camera because our engineers are rough on them and they get beaten up.  They are frequently out in the rain or snow, dragged up a ladder, used on a scaffold, etc.  We typically own at least 3 of these cameras at a time.  One of them, which was approximately 3 years old, was recently dropped, damaging the zooming capability of the lens.  We sent the camera back to Fuji for a repair estimate, which they provide at no cost.  As it turned out, the estimate for repair was about $100 and for a few extra dollars, we got a new and improved version of what is basically the same camera we had before with a warranty.  It was not a hard decision to make.  Fuji even shipped the old camera back at no charge.  The new camera has an 18:1 optical zoom, while the old one had a 12:1 optical zoom.  The increased zoom capability will allow us to get better closeup photos from a greater distance than the old camera.

The camera does NOT come with a camera SD media card, a negative.  Having to run out to WallMart to buy one was a pain [$12-15].  The electronic view finder is tricky, also, and unavailable when certain conditions are present.  The lens cover is both a winner and a loser:  it pops off the moment you turn the camera on, a plus, but is cheap and does not fit tightly, and thus is easy to accidently knock off.

You can't do that with this camera, which means you have to load the CD on any and all computers you might use.

True, the manual suggested using a tripod, but one is not always available when you are ready to shoot.The manual is better than most, but there are still a few pages where an engineer is required to translate.  Still, it is organized well and is written in good English.  [And French, and Spanish.]Quality of photos you might ask?  I'd rate them a 9 on a scale of 10.

The most annoying thing about the camera is the freeze ups. I have a 4gb Fujifilm SDHC card, and it freezes up on me occasionally when previewing pictures on the card.

If they had simply threaded the lens so it could accept a standard size filter, it would have greatly expanded the functionality of the camera.Problem two: You can't save your images in RAW format. This limits the things you can do with the images in programs like Photoshop and GIMP.Both of these features could have been included, and it wouldn't have affected the average customers point-and-shoot experience with automatic settings.I think if FujiFilm fixed both of those things, this camera would give entry-level DSLR cameras a bit of competition.But it wasn't all bad. The macro and super-macro settings allow for some very close up and highly detailed photos, and the zoom is excellent as well. The ability to manually select ISO (as well as the wide range of ISO settings), f-stop, and shutter speed, make this a really remarkable camera despite my personal complaints with it.So if you're looking for a far better than average point-and-shoot, that can take good photos in a variety of settings, this is the camera to buy.I rated it a 5 across the board, because for what it is, this camera is beyond excellent.

I leave mine on Shutter priority and set the shutter speed high enough to avoid blur.Zoom is nice took some hand held at maximum zoom that turned out perfect.Software that is supposed to work with Windows 7 crashes on the 64 bit version unless you set comparability to XP.Mini USB plug is so small hard to orient it when plugging it into the camera unless you remember the USB symbol on the plug faces the front of the camera.Video not all that great sound wise.Even after all these gripes I like the camera and it was at a good price. To get anything better would have cost almost 200 dollars more. I have had much more expensive cameras that had noise in shadows even in bright sunlight and I am surprised that a camera that does not have a CMOS sensor can take this kind of quality picture. If this camera is an upgrade from what you have been using you will be very happy. If it is a downgrade from an expensive DSLR you have to live with its quirks.Would recommend this camera.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Don't Do It", "Author": "MrsStigg", "ReviewID": "R23MSF1ZXF0TPN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worst camera I ever owned.My batteries are drained almost as soon as I put them into the camera.The photos are not very good and the settings are always screwed up.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Glad I bought mine before it became popular!

It is almost a perfect cross between professional and personal.Some functions on the camera I don't know anything about as I have never taken classes, but other functions are as easy as going to the menu and selecting what you want for the scene you are taking the photo in. It starts up fast but takes a while to focus witch is something I really dislike as you cannot manually focus. Another thing I don't like about this camera is that it's zoom is digital and the lens can't be removed as far as I know of. Some of you might think there's no problem with having a digital zoom, we'll when your videotaping it makes noise that is captured in the video as the mic is on the side of the camera instead of in the front like it should be. As far as battery consumption goes with this camera, overall I don't really have a problem. I'd say battery life is about up to an hour and this is no problem if you buy a couple sets of rechargeable batteries. The video mode on this isn't as good as I expected it to be; it looks good on the three inch lcd but when its on the computer it is definitely not hd video. I've only gotten it to 480p witch is a major downside. However it's not bad for the price.I really like how this camera can stabilize images when they are moving at a fast pace or in motion. I'd say the ratio to good photos to bad photos of in motion subject is about 60 to 70 if you don't have aperature mode on. Night mode is not very good unless your subject is still and you have it in night(tripod) mode. Regular night mode is ok but its not as good as Night(tripod) mode.If your subject is very still then you will have a great shot it is very clear and I use this mode even when it's not night. auto gives you pretty decent shots and they have an sr auto mode that detects which mode it should be in and switches it automatically, I've gotten some really unique and great shots from this mode that I like a lot.Overall if your looking for a great mid personal to professional dslr camera that's affordable than this is just for you, but if your looking for a more professional camera I would recommend saving more for a better dslr.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "blurry photos", "Author": "wendy", "ReviewID": "R3SVHIT5OF85FR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I admit I am not the most tech savvy person but this camera is very hard to use and does not get quality clear photos on a consistent basis.

And I wasn't dissappointed.I purchased the S1800 because of the quality of the zoom, and speed of the camera compared to the Nikon.I also purchased the S1800 because of the ease of menu navigation I was used to with a previous Fujifilm F50fd.The shots compared with the S1800 and the F50fd were amazing, even though both cameras are at 12mp.The S1800 outshines in clarity, less noise and overall better picture, especially in low light photos.The body is small, but very lightweight, very easy to carry around.The only downside I have with this camera is that it takes 4 AA batteries, and is a bottom loading SD card. (Means I have to take off the tripod every time to get the SD card out)And that the battery cover seems cheap and flimsy.The camera also makes a low whining noise in quiet situations when the lens is turned on, but it shouldn't bother most people.The main problem that people have against this camera is the SD card not being compatible, but I have not have that issue, my 16gb Kingston SDHC card has no issues at all. Even my other generic brand SD cards have no problem being read, including Kodak 4gb SD, Panasonic 2gb SD, and an imitation chinese brand SD cards has no problems at all. If you have problems with your SD card, you can format them from your camera.Another problem that people have with this Camera from previous reviews I've read is the blurriness.With a ultra zoom camera, you're GOING to have blur if you're not using a tripod to steady the camera, This isn't exactly a point and shoot camera. And for those who are unfamiliar with photography, do not know how to use manual mode, and only use automatic mode will lower the quality of all photos.Overall, I can say that this is one of the best product I've bought in 2010.Not exactly a Point and Shoot camera, and not exactly a DSLRFor $150, you definitely cannot go wrong with this purchase.$150 is a good investment to practice photography and learning how to use a camera and how they function before actually purchasing a DSLR", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Jason Lawrence", "ReviewID": "R1LRRZBQRSAC3V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "love the camera.

There is no comparison.  The s1800 photos as a whole look far more professional.  The s1800 seems to have a black element added to the photo processing so blacks are really black and not a blend of primary colors.  This camera loves black and white and shadows. The colors are vivid and sharp, especially against a dark background or subjects that have flecks fof black.  I have already taken several photos I am proud to hang on my wall.

Simkin", "ReviewID": "R2Q69CUNXU2GHI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera through Amazon about two weeks ago, and I have been very happy with my purchase.  When you consider this camera's sub-$200 dollar price in light of what it is able to do, there's no way to give it fewer than five stars.  Unless you plan on becoming a professional photographer, this is the last camera you'll ever need.  I have already taken sports page quality telephoto pictures of my daughter's soccer games, and HD quality video of school events.  This camera is amazing!  The image stability works as advertised, as does the blink detection.  The 18x zoom is just unbelievable, you can get on-the-field type pictures at events.  You are getting so much camera per dollar spent that you literally can't go wrong with a Fuji.To be objective, let me mention a few of the camera's weak points.  I mention these with the understanding that none of these detract from the five-star rating when considered in terms of the its price. First, the auto focus system is not quite the equal of the high powered zoom the camera has.  What happens is, if you're trying to take an action shot at extreme range, the camera will not focus quickly enough to get the shot you want.  To overcome this you have to anticipate the shot you want.  You partly depress the shutter button which activates the autofocus.  When it's \"on\" it will give you a yellow crosshair type reticle.  Keep it depressed as you track your subject, then snap the picture slightly ahead (before, prior to) of the scene you want.  It takes some practice, but you can get excellent shots doing this.  You face a similar challenge when using the motor drive feature.  You just have to make sure that you are \"pre-focused\" on your subject before you start shooting.Second, the camera's microphone is located near the lens.  When you are video taping and you use the zoom feature, it ends up being pretty lound on the soundtrack.  I would point out, however, that you only notice this when taking quiet videos, like nature or something like that.  At a sports event, you'll never hear it because the ambient crowd noise more than drowns it out.  It doesn't really bother me, but it is noticable.Despite these weaknesses, my five star vote stands intact and unblemished.  For under two hundred dollars, you're gonna love this camera!  It is probably one of the most versatile and capable non-SLR digitals that has ever been marketed.

I attended the Activision concert and was able to take these really amazing photos even from far back. I was amazed at how far I could zoom in to snap some ace photos of Usher, Eminem, and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden.The only downsides? I had grabbed a random SD card my family owned to use for my photos, and found out too late that the camera only takes Class 4 SD cards. This means that I was only able to take a max of around 8 photos my entire trip at E3. Not only that, but I lost the box that the camera came in on the flight to LA (I was all caught up trying to help this man with his luggage that I left the box under the seat after I had grabbed my carryon). So, I wasn't able to take the current photos off my camera, and had to rely on these two eyes of mine for the rest of the trip. You can't use a typical mini-USB plug on this camera since the plug is more square than rectangle, so I have yet to find a cable that is compatible with this one. But really, I was really, really upset that the camera doesn't recognize anything other than Class 4 cards. I certainly do not like having to go out of my way to find compatible products. This is why I gave it 4 stars. I may amend this review after I order a new card, but what a hassle! If it only accepted every class of SD cards like most Canon cameras do, and accept universal mini-USB cables, this would have almost unanimous 5 star reviews on Amazon and be a constant best seller in my opinion!Other than the experience above and the sad loss of the box, this camera was a real treat and I had some amazing photos.

I was very impressed with my initial pictures taken at Letchworth State Park last Autumn and I wanted to update the review after some real experience with it. I am not a pro but I do use this professionally (I am a Realtor). I had several years experience with a 6MP Fuji P&S; and that was not an easy decision since I am from the home of Kodak. I needed a couple of features which that did not have, namely a through the lens viewer and a wider angle lens capability. Both features work great. The wide view is not so wide as to cause distortion and the lens capability allows me to take better shots without dealing with glare on the ample back screen.As I learn more about photograghy I realize that there are other features I would like to explore but the bottom line is those require a full on DSLR camera. This has more to do with special flash functions than higher quality pictures. If you are looking for a P&S; camera that has high quality picture quality as well as a whole host of special features, this is it at a modest price.  I am learning about bracketing and HDR- if you have no idea what I am talking about then you probably don't need to spend one penny more for another camera.I had a few issues which were from unfamiliarity. I am not impressed with the manual (online), however my latest issue (it stopped taking pictures which is unconvenient at least) was resolved very quickly by Fuji. (Tip: 1-800-800-3854) If something odd like that happens, try this: Menu; Setup; Reset; OK.If need be I may update this again.Original:I just received this a few days ago. I went to Letchworth State Park in NY to take advantage of the fall colors and try out the camera. For some reason the Chrome selection does not work. It just toggles past it. What disturbs me is that nothing in the manual talks about warranty. After chasing my tail with Amazon (seems the best option is probably going to be to return it), I got a link to Fuji and am waiting to hear back to see if there is some software update to correct this. Anyway, in the warranty verbiage they talk about refurbished parts or camera to solve the issue. Whoa there! If I wanted refurbished I would have bought one for less money!Hopefully there will be a software fix for this problem. I have had a simpler Fuji camera for a number of years and it has worked flawlessly giving great pictures. That was one of the primary reasons I chose to go with this one. BTW, I took a look at the pictures I took at the park (149 to be exact due to battery life) and I expected to have a lot of throw away shots (I am no pro). I was extremely impressed with how they came out. It seems the Fuji quality pictures are still available with this camera. In fact the chrome function is available on my older Fuji. Anyway I will follow up once this is resolved so as to give proper feedback (I haven't thrown in the towel on this, I just want it fixed). BTW, I bought a Durecell charger and spare batteries. I think they are a must with digital. I used the Discharge function to finish them off as out of the box they were not near full charge. This is all to be expected.

I wanted to obtain more than 5 megapixel capability.  The wider angle and longer telephoto lens was also a plus. The lever action would be a reasonable alternative to the buttons for adjusting the focal length, but the action is so fast that adjustments are too great to properly use the lenses capabilities.The lens performs well optically, but it does not have threads for a protective or other filter.  More importantly, it has only two aperture settings.  This reduces the camera to using variable image sensor sensitivity instead of f-stops: fixed ISO settings are impossible in Auto, SR Auto, Natural Light, Panorama, Movie (of course), and Shutter Priority modes.  It also eliminates all but the most rudimentary ability to control depth of field.The view finder suffers from chromatic aberration, though the problem does not appear in the final image.  The diopter adjustment has been removed making the view finder making it difficult to use for those of us who wear glasses.The shutter response is agonizingly slow rendering the camera unfit for candid shots, animals, sports, and many other types of photography.

Being my first camera, I wanted something that could take very good shots of small animals and reptiles, as well as my artwork.After a little over a year with this camera, I've found some faults.1. I have used the super macro setting with perfect lighting, on full zoom or no zoom, yet no matter how close or far I am, if the subject (insect, reptile, flower) is under 3\" or so, it will come out noisy and the color will be off. I see little to no difference between macro, and super macro, other than not being able to use the flash, or full zoom optical  on the super. Not a problem for things larger than 3\", such as mice and large birds/insects, they usually come out clear and defined if used in proper light and the correct settings.2. The \"specialized\" settings, such as sport, low light/fireworks, party, beach, and sunset, are not as significant as they seem. You can do better on \"custom\" mode, and change the settings as you go. All that those fancy settings do, is what you could do manually, and it comes out better if you do it yourself. Even worse, you can not control the light, ISO, or size you want to photo to be. The only setting I am fond of in that section is \"flower\" in which case they do come out slightly more vivid and the background is wonderfully blurred.3. The digital zoom is NOISY. I can almost guarantee, no matter what setting you have it on, even with a tripod, the photos will be grainy and blurry. And if this is a moving object, forget about definition and contrast, it comes out overly bright or dark, and the shutter takes forever to actually take the picture.4. Color is decent, if you have it on the right settings, and in perfect light. If you want nighttime photos, please use flash. Without it, the photos are overly red, blurred, and grainy.5. The auto (which I have used once, just to see) is very poor. I try never to use it, just because you are capable of so much more when you edit the settings yourself. Auto is for quick snapshots, and only if you do not care about quality, they are washed out and not to the camera's full capability.6. The movies are great, in good lighting. However, you can not focus while you are shooting, it auto focuses, often leaving you a few seconds of a blurry subject. There is no light correction, special features, or stabilization. You literally point and shoot. An example can be found here:[...] and [...]Lots of grain mentioned? Yes, even with 12.2 MP and low ISO, it still takes grainy photos over 400 speed.This is a very nice camera for the beginner and intermediate. Editing is usually a must. However, although I am in not a professional photographer, and do not have the terminology of one, I am an semi-professional artist, in which case I need spectacular reference photos for my artwork, with excellent color accuracy, contrast, and little or no grain/noise. I shoot with the lowest ISO I can manage, usually 64 to 200 MAX. I am looking to upgrade to a DSLR, or higher quality PnS very soon, but I highly recommend this camera for anyone who wants to take nice \"around the house\" shots.

Uses an SD card.  Love the SD card.  Our original Fuji used an XD card.Cons and this is a big one for me:1. The wonderful SD card and the batteries are in the same spot.  Once that cover is off, both the batteries and the card are exposed.  You think, \"So what's the big deal?\"  The big deal is that sometimes -- not just sometimes but frequently even though I am careful, the batteries come out too.2. The cover holding in the batteries and the SD card is difficult to remove.Overall, the camera is just not as user friendly for me.

I purchased it as a stepping stone to a dSLR, and most often shoot in manual mode. For $200, I think the super zoom lens is pretty awesome. zoom is reasonably quick, and despite the barrel/pincushion distortion at either ends of the zoom range, it does very solidly in the middle range. The barrel distortion on the wide end is actually a bit fun when you get used to it (though technically undesirable) and the pincushioning isn't enough to be a real problem. The super-macro setting is brilliant - this lens focuses criminally close. Although this isn't \"true macro\", it's still pretty dang awesome.This is the first camera I have shot in manual mode, so I have some gripes that may be considered normal on a camera of this level. The aperture can only be set to one of two settings at any zoom range - which means that you do not have full control. The Electronic Viewfinder (used for when it's light out so you can avoid staring at a screen with glare) is almost nauseating because of the slight lag. The little screen in there is also very mediocre. A lack of a \"B\" function for the shutter is a bit annoying, but also something I guess I hsould expect from a camera like this.The high iso capabilties of the camera are near-nonexistent. I see very bothersome graininess coming in at even ISO 400. That means it's hard to take photos in even slightly dark situations without the flash, which is extremely bothersome. I especially like taking night shots, and end up taking most photos at ISO 100 or 200 with a tripod at 8\" exposure and maximum aperture.This camera is also BIG. If you're planning on getting more into photography, I would look at other options. Smaller compacts will allow you to carry the camera with you in your pocket, which is a great learning tool (always have a camera with you!). This won't fit in a pocket, but will take up some awkward chunky space in the corner of a bag. remember that size isn't everything - the canon G11 will sprint circles around this camera but is significantly smaller.

I've taken thousands of photos, and it was a tremendous upgrade from my previous FujiFilm camera. However, there are some definite pros and cons about the camera.Pros: While not a small camera by today's standards, it is a convenient size. I've never had any trouble carrying it on trips. The photos are great, even at full zoom. I've taken a lot of photos of people, wildlife and nature. It's not the best in low-light scenarios without a tripod, but that is something you'll see with most cameras. I've received many comments about the quality of the photos I take. The camera will also pick up bright stars and can photograph the moon.Cons: There is a distinct \"clicking\" noise in videos if you zoom in or out during recording. You may have trouble uploading videos directly from the camera if they're too large. The auto-shooting dial to switch between settings will alternate between Auto and Scene Selection without the dial being touched. This can cause you to lose focus on a shot and have to re-focus. This started happening after about a year of use. After two years of use, the zoom button started malfunctioning.Overall, it is a good camera. The photos are great, but the hardware does not stand the test of time. I would not recommend the camera, unless you're on a strict budget. I would not re-purchase the camera.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm FinePix S1800 12.2MP Digital Camera w/18x Zoom.", "Author": "Jayman \"J. Williams Photography\"", "ReviewID": "R2VDPUQ5FL8U5H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I normally don't leave reviews about any of the products I purchase. However, this one deserves it. This is the first time I've ever used a Fujifilm brand camera and I must say, it's got what it takes if you know what your doing. It's set up for both, basic users and advanced users. I personally am a photographer and normally use multiple cameras for different setups and that's the main reason I have purchased the Fujifilm FinePix S1800 after reading more than 50 other reviews about it. However, do not go by the photographs that some have stated they took with this camera. These photographs are stock photo's from the original website and was taken from the Fujifilm FinePix S2800HD camera and it is a little more expensive. I own now the Fujifilm FinePix S1800,S2550HD, and the S2800HD. Don't waste your money on the S2550HD-only difference is the HD quality and if you have the skills you can get the same quality from the s1800, and the only difference with the s2800 is the HD quality and the mega pixel. I as a photographer would not use 14.2 mega pixels to shoot quality photos. Now I have some issues to state about the S1800. I don't like the fact that it's more than 150.00 after tax and don't have the option to set other lens on it, I own a cheaper brand that I paid 89.00 for and it has many different lens options. This is a downer on such a nicely set up camera. However, it does have the Super Marco which is great. I don't like how slow it is to transfer the photos to the computer, I am fast paced and this slows me down a lot. It's feel is off, meaning it feels grungy. The texture on the camera is bubbly and is hard for me to get used to. Another problem I found is the cameras stability control, it works, but it don't. I suppose if you had a very windy day and your camera was moving very fast and as if it was almost trying to fall over than it works good. I tested it and had to move it fast and side to side more than an inch to make it work on both stability control settings. This is poorly set. The photos are high quality though and that's a plus. Note: Do not use Alkaline batteries if you are doing photo shots, you'll be replacing them every 10-15 min. I use rechargeable 2900mAh batteries and they get me through at least 2 days if I happen to forget to charge them each day. I take photos all day long this camera should have the option to use AC/DC power pack. But it don't. Over all rating is 4.0 of 5.

The 12 megapixles take fantastic photos if your subject isn't moving at all. I take photos of people who are skateboarding, or rollerblading, and it is almost impossible to use in those situations because the shutter isn't fast enough. Although in every other situation this surpasses every task you throw at it. The stills are fantastic like I said. The video features are great also, but the only issue with that is it doesn't auto focus. Whenever I try to take video, the HD is amazing and everyone I know is impressed by it, but when you move the camera while recording, it goes out of focus and it takes a while to catch up, and there is no way to do it manually. I absolutely love the panoramic mode and for $150 I would buy the camera simply for that. In the end its a great camera and the HD is great minus not being able to focus correctly and the slow shutter speed I would recommend this to anyone any day.

Most of my pictures were in low light conditions which I know is worst-case.  The pictures were not good at all--they were fuzzy and dark.  The video quality was even worse.  The videos were dark and had lines of light throughout them. I admit that I did not play around with the different modes because I felt like the Auto mode (which detected which mode to use) should take good pictures. It seemed to do a good job of detecting the right mode but pictures just weren't good.  On New Years Day, I started using my Canon in the same conditions as the Fuji to compare them.  There was a huge difference, especially in video quality.  The Canon video was significantly brighter and had no lines.

With tempuratures in the teens and twenties I've been taking long distance pictures at full zoom through the kitchen window over the sink with my arm braced and the pictures have been acceptable. Closer shots have been impressive. The camera has some sort of stabilizer in it; it will hesitate when taking a shot to lock in on the subject and get the clearest picture possible.

I have found digital cameras so lacking compared to film that I am a late convert.  I find that once used to the controls, it is easy to use.  The zoom covers most all of my needs, and the lens, while not up to the standards of old minolta glass, has FAR less barrel and pincushion distortion than some of the earlier cannon autofocus lenses, and in fact is surprisingly good.  I particularly like the manual modes.  Image stabilization on stage one still requires a steady hand or tripod at max zoom.  Complaints about blurry zoom are user error issues.  I have not had time to check out all the \"scene\" modes, but being used to manual settings, this will take some getting used to.  Exposure has been dead on very consistantly.  Focus in spot mode is really \"spot\", so it needs close attention.  The intelligent focus mode is excellent  Macro is very clean.  In sharp mode, sharpness is on par with more expensive cameras.  Noise is  adequate at low iso settings, but despite some reviews, is better than many costlier cameras provided you stay below 800.  If you are comfortable with gimp or photoshop this is very fixable.  Noise is poor at very high iso settings.  Auto white balance, when compared to manually set balance is right on the money.  Chromatic aberation is about the same as most cameras 100- 150 $ more, a little less sharp edged and intense but sl larger.  Since there are few ultra-zoom cameras in this price range, most comparisons are with more expensive cameras.  This one will do a better job than a Nikon, not quit as good as a cannon, and is an excellent value.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm all the way", "Author": "M.

I also have a Casio S12 that I love.  This S1800 takes nice clean pictures, very little noise.  Portraits are tack sharp, landscapes are bit soft but little or no noise.  I like the image stabilization.  I set the camera to P and set my ISO to 200 indoors and I.S. still works and the ISO remains at 200.  The 18x zoom is like having a telescope.  I swear you could use this camera as a papparazi camera.  When you fully zoomed out to 18x, there is another button you can push that doubles the zoom twice.  I think that is 72x, I could be wrong but it seems like it doubles for each click.  It lowers the megapixels but the photo is still optical and sharp.  Then there is digital zoom on top of that, but I do not use it since it is apparent that it degrads the quality too much.  To get this zoom in a slr you would have to spend thousands just on the lens alone.  This camera is a very good value.The flash seems decent, good enough.I was having card errors at first until I changed the SD card.  I am using a Kingston 32GB SDHC card and it seems to be working good.  So I suggest playing with it before you start taking the important shots to make sure the card and camera like each other.The HD video is the best I have had in a camera.  The I.S. works in video also and the video turns out smoother.  It is also very clear and vibrant.  People complain about the zoom noise while taking a video.  I do not see it as a problem, especially if your video has any kind of sound, you will never hear the zoom noise.  If it is perfectly quiet, then you hear it.  There is also some background noise in video's but again, not a big deal especially if there is any kind of sound in the video.  I got a lens adapter that tightens onto the barrel of the lens.  So even though there is no thread on the lens, you can still attach things to it.  The lens adapter with a uv filter was 25.00.  I keep the uv filter off because I feel it degrads the quality, but I keep the lens tube on, it makes the camera look nicer, plus protects it from a fall.The price is right, the camera is best in it's class.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great picture quality", "Author": "Karen Zygnerski", "ReviewID": "RMDRVKFA01BYD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The quality of the pictures for the price is fantastic.

He has always been into taking quality pictures, and we have owned and used an old Fuji SLR film camera for years. My daughter gave us her old Fujifilm A303 digital, which was so user friendly, that when it finally quit working well, we went straight back to Fujifilm and bought the Finepix S1800. It is not for the fainthearted; let me make that clear here! My husband loves it, but he read the book-the one you download and is over an inch thick, rather than the owners manual that comes with it. He can make that camera do everything you would ever want. It doesn't have manual control for closing down the lens, which is the only place he would want improved, but this is really more of a professional type of users camera.I just take pictures in the auto mode.

This is my second camera I own.  I own the Sony Cybershot DSC-P5 which was a great camera back in the days.  But the FujiFilm S1800 is far beyond the Sony Cybershot.  This camera is a 12 Megapixel camera capable of shooting panorama pictures right from the camera.  There are a lot of features besides this.  I'm not a fan of Optical Zoom, but this camera handles it well.  There are many custom settings based on the situation.  Scenic, Portrait, Nightime, Sports.  It also allows you to shoot continues frames as well.  There are a few different options within the continuous frame mode itself.It also shoots 640p movies.  Depending on the amount of SDHC memory you can shoot up to 30 minutes worth of video. At the largest files and resolution.The camera has a great feature for face recognition and also blink detection.  Which alerts you when the camera thinks that the person blinked.  You have the option to re-shoot.I like the fact that you can do a panormaic shot up to three panels and the camera will \"stitch\" the picture for you right from the camera.  Many other cameras rely on you to do this with the software, but you can do it right from the camera.The best thing is that this camera runs on regular AA alkaline batteries, or other types that size and not these batteries that are hard to find or need to be recharged.  You can use AA rechargeable batteries, but if not, the good old AA Alkaline will work.  My mother has a camera that she can't find batteries for because they no longer make them.  I'm so happy that this camera is not like that.The things that I thought would've been nice is a better lens cap.  It comes off very easily.  The other thing I wish it would do is automatically pop the \"Flash\" hood up for you if the lighting is not enough and the mode is set where you need light.  One of the Canon pictures I use at work, actually opens the hood for the flash when it detects that there needs a flash.  With the Fuji S1800 you need to press the button to open the hood.The other issue I have is that I wish it would include at least a 2 MB SD memory card.

For the past several years I have exclusively owned Panasonic Lumix FZ series cameras and have loved them. I like DSLR type cameras because they are more sturdy and have more features than point and shoot cameras. My most recent camera was a Panasonic FZ35 that I paid $329 for. By accident I dropped it and it broke. It was still under warranty, but I was told it could take weeks or months to get it repaired by Panasonic's repair company.In the meantime I needed a camera because I am a seller on ebay and I have to take photos of my products. I was in a pinch and borrowed my mom's Canon PowerShot A470. It was a horrible camera! The photos came out blurry, the exposure was way off and my pictures looked dreadful. The only way I could take a decent photo with that camera was if I had a tripod and the photo was taken outdoors. I was desperate for a cheap camera that would take quality photos.With both fingers crossed behind my back, I purchased the Fuji S1800. I saw a few negative reviews stating that the photo quality was lacking. I don't know why, but I chose to ignore them.I was looking for more than just a point and shoot camera and one that was similar to my favorite Panasonic Lumix DSLR type cameras. As soon as I received this one I took it out of the box and fired it up. It was a nice looking camera and was almost identical in looks to my favorite Lumix FZ series DSLR type cameras. The body felt somewhat cheap and plasticky though. I was nervous because I hoped I didn't just waste my money. The pictures came out blurry, dark, grainy and the colors were soft and not vivid.It does have a lot of features similar to the Panasonic Lumiz FZ35, but the quality of the camera is just not up to par with my Panasonic. I know the camera is a lot less expensive than the Panasonic camera I am mentioning, but for the price it should at least take considerably better pictures. I tweaked all the different features, tried all the different menu features and it still did not really make much of a difference. What a shame because I really wanted to like this camera.Also what surprised me is that even the worst cameras will take a decent photo outside. This one was horrible outside and everything came out very dark. I tried adjusting the white balance and the iso settings and it still didn't do much. I also even tried using the flash outdoors in shady areas and everything still had a dark hue.Only in the best lighting conditions will this camera perform well.

Because of the love I had for my S5200, I decided to buy the Fuji Finepix S1800.Needless to say I was VERY Disappointed!!!The primary reason for my disappointment was the picture quality in natural/low light conditions.  I tried every setting imaginable to produce a good picture inside my house.  Everything without the flash was grainy.  I took pictures with my S5200 from the same angles in the same light, just on the auto setting.  These pictures were way better!  We also attended a concert for my son and shot some video in the school's gym.  Again, very grainy, unimpressive picture.  This left me thinking that the S1800 was not an improvement over the S5200.

As a former point and shoot, I wanted to upgrade to something that was more advanced but also easier to use. The handgrip is really great for keeping my hands steady for zoomed shots. Being used to point and shoot and taking photos with my iPhone, I instantly noticed a difference in zoomed picture quality. Still, as others have mentioned, you will probably need a tripod for extreme zoom which is to be expected from any camera.The 18x wide-angle optical zoom is AWESOME! I have never had a camera like this before and, like I said, been an iPhoneographer primarily and rarely get prints of photos, only upload them for friends and family to view on Picasa and Facebook. Anyway, the wide-angle lens is amazing. I live in the land of 10,000 lakes and there are opportunities all around me to capture gorgeous landscapes from lakes to hillsides to beautiful green forests. This was the big hook for me. I'm a panorama addict and I can't rave enough about how great these pictures are. I'm also looking forward to my next family reunion and getting everyone in one shot without having to squish everyone together. The zoom has also won me over completely. It is extremely powerful. The example images are no exaggeration. I zoomed in on my neighbors mailbox halfway down the street and could clearly see the intricate detail and name carved out of the post. I could have never done this with my point and shoot.The Sensor-shift Image Stabilization is also very valuable to me. We were out adventuring last week and it was a brisk, chill day and I had the darnedest time keeping my hands still with that chilly wind beating on me. But every picture I took was still clear as day and you'd never know how I was struggling to keep still.About the HD video capture, however, I have to be honest and say it's not that great. In fair light conditions the video was pretty grainy. It wasn't terrible and my cheap video camera does much worse, but I was somewhat disappointed. The resolution was huge, sure, but the quality was just not there. It certainly wasn't any better than my current point and shoot, but not any worse either so I guess it's a wash in that respect. On the other hand, I love that we can just plug the camera right into the TV and show off our photos with a slideshow or watch the videos on the fly right after taking them. My 5-year-old loved the fact that I could set the camera up and let him dance while he watched himself on the big screen. A nice plus. ;)I also love having a viewfinder, as others have mentioned. I don't really have too much trouble seeing the LCD on sunny days, but sometimes for me it's just easier to get the shot I want with a traditional viewfinder. As for the LCD, I was disappointed at first that it is not a touchscreen, but what started as disappointment quickly turned into appreciation. My point and shoot has a touchscreen and I am constantly accidentally changing settings just by holding the camera. I really enjoy having complete control over the UI, even though it is done through the buttons and not touchscreen. Sometimes doing things the old way is better!I do have to point out a few flaws as others have, regarding the blink detection and smile recognition. These have never worked for me and seem completely random. I am looking to just turn them off because it gets rather annoying when the camera won't take the picture because it's waiting for the smile that's already present. That said, you are still getting a lot of camera for your money. This is the same price as my little point and shoot, which will still have a place in my home simply because it's so small and portable, but for special events and when I'm looking to capture something really great, this camera is my new best friend. It has so many advanced features, just enough to get me going on my journey to became a better photographer, but not too much to be overwhelming or to require me to tote along a huge bag full of gadgets.

My Kodac, even after years of abuse and use, never had a grainy screen.2) when I tried to delete pics the camera would freeze up and not complete the delete comand. It would also freeze up after I zoomed in or out. This is not winning it any admiration from me. The only way to unfreeze it was to dislodge the battery compartment and remove the batteries as the on/off switch was also froze up.3) Low light is terrible and since I will be taking a lotof indoor pics, I will treat this like a cheap disposable camera as that is what it seems to amount to.

The problems with this camera arose when I tried to take indoor photos.  If you can use natural light, the photos are fine.  If you are unfortunate enough to need the flash, you're going to get a terrible photo.  Every photo taken with a flash was much too bright.Even when I would back up and use the zoom feature, most of the time these photos were too bright and washed out.

M. Arnold \"Geoff, that is\"", "ReviewID": "R326T69EG2YSZ8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We take the \"trickle-down\" of technology for granted, and nowhere more so than in digital photography. A couple of years ago, most cameras had sensors that could register 3-4 megapixels and  \"optical zoom\" of 3x. Indeed zoom was so pitiful that camera incorporated the widely ridiculed \"digital zoom\" which traded image quality for zoom. Things like 10MP sensors and zooms of greater than 12x were the province of the semi-pro and DSLR crowd, and commanded commensurate prices. Today, every camera can handle more pixels than we know what to do with, and even shirt-pocket sub-compacts can do impressive optical zooms using bizarre optical plumbing.I used to have a rule: buy the best digital camera I could get for $250. Every 18 months I would get a new device which absolutely knocked the socks off its predecessor. Technology trickle down.But how fast does stuff trickle down? And what happens if a manufacturer gets it wrong?Coincidentally, I got hold of the subject of this review, the Fujifilm S1800, just a few days after I'd bought myself a Nikon Coolpix P90. On paper, they look fairly comparable. The S1800 is 12MP, with 18x zoom; the P90 is 12.1MP with 24x zoom. (But how often will I care about the difference between 18x and 24x?) Both have image stabilization (essential at high zoom, unless you carry around a tripod), and loads of fancy features which take forever to learn. The biggest difference is the price: the P90 cost me just under $400, while the S1800 is $204 - almost half the price. Clearly the S1800 is a great demonstration of technology trickle-down: features which used to be expensive are now available at a more modest price.Well, maybe not. My partner and I tried the S1800 in various settings - portraits, landscapes, action shots, bird-watching, macro - and neither of us was impressed. The autofocus light is extraordinarily bright: portrait subjects were literally dazzled by it. Action shots and birdwatching were frustrating, because the shutter lag is so bad. Landscapes? Every shot required color rebalancing. And the slow, noisy zoom discourages the use of the available 18x magnification.You can see a couple of comparative shots at my MobileMe gallery - go to [...]The S1800 certainly includes a number of interesting features, and I'd encourage you to see if any of them address your personal photography needs. It offers HD video, but frankly if I want video recording I'm going to use a dedicated camcorder like my trusty JVC Everio GZ-HM200. But at the end of the day, I felt that the FinePix S1800 wasn't ready for prime time - that the relevant technologies had not yet \"trickled down\" to the point where they were really usable. The worst offender is the shutter lag, which is probably symptomatic of a range of small design choices and technology selections.I'm sticking with my P90.", "Date": "May 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Traci Swoboda", "ReviewID": "R1INJINFSP5Z4B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was my BIG christmas present to myself and I blame myself for such a bad choice.

You can take it without the extra light, but if you want to see what your doing you might want to add the light. I was going to box the S1800 back up and send it back. But now decided to keep it. Today I did some more testing and found out I can change the ISO which is max out at 6400. Default is 100 (Auto SR) M ISO 800 is better to use. If you change it to 1600 in low-light they it's to grainy. I think Fujifilm was trying to make this Digital SLR-Like easy for everyone to use. Well in a way it is easy. You get a lot for the money. I quickly ditch the Panasonic Batteries for Sanyo Eneloop you can take 500 digital shots with those you can find them here with the quick charger: http://www.amazon.com/Sanyo-Eneloop-Pre-Charged-Rechargable-Batteries/dp/B000IV0REA/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1269578616&sr;=1-5. 4x AA is what the S1800 uses. Here's shot of the micro-close-up:[...]The image above convince me to keep the S1800, otherwise it would have gone back in for a full refund. Indoor shots using ISO 800 instead of Auto 100 were better. Blue snow clears up when you move the camera to the lite area. I had given S1800 a poor score but after taking some more images to day I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Make sure you get the latest firmware update from Fujifilm. Best way to get that into the Camera is to use SD card and download the file to your computer and copy it to the SD card. Fujifilm gives you app to move the file to SD card. Don't know why they do that. Still you turn off the S1800 and then press power and press the DISP/Back button. After that it will ask you do you want to upgrade the firmware you say yes indeed!There is also HD mode, still for what you get 720p, external speaker to here back your video. I have something else for video which is small and has stereo sound. The S1800 is mono, but good enough.
