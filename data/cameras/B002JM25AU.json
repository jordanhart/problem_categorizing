Its photos are technically pleasing 95% of the time. I never knew a camera could be this nice.I love how the self timer works. It stays in effect until turned off, so I can do a long session of tripod mounted macros without having to use buttons and menus. There's even an option to have it remember the self timer setting when the camera is turned off and on. This will save huge amounts of time for night photography.The interface was very easy to figure out. I was operating it with ease right away.Video quality is excellent. 30 fps 1280x720 clips look incredible on an HDTV. The camera allows white balance and EV adjustments in video mode. The live histogram is accurate and useful to help capture the ideal image. Audio sounds clean and great too. The self timer function is available in video mode, so camera shake at the beginning of clips can be eliminated. Unlike QuickTime, the camera's AVI file format easily imports into Windows Movie Maker and Virtual Dub.I use D-Range to control shadows and highlights. It works! I took a picture of new, bright white sneakers with black accents in noon sunlight and it turned out perfectly, even with contrast set to high. That kind of subject has far too much dynamic range for other cameras I've used.I wish it had a black and white mode so I could simply get BW photos directly. There's an in-camera conversion option, but in the opinion of this reviewer it's a waste of battery life and storage space. Picasa does very good BW conversions of P80 photos. Other cameras have problems with challenging BW subjects like white and chrome cars on sunny days, but Pentax has it figured out. I'm always amazed to see wide, perfectly contained histograms in test photos I was sure would be failures. It's hard to make it clip shadows and highlights.I didn't expect such useful results from a small, high resolution sensor. To my delight, the sensor delivers 12 good megapixels. Detail is excellent. The camera doesn't aggressively reduce noise and smear colors together.It does lens correction. 28mm shots with strong barrel distortion are beautifully converted to scenes with straight lines and edges. It happens fast too.I'm a very negative, fault finding person. It says a lot that this product exceeds my modest expectations.After experimenting with its huge amounts of adjustment settings, I will use it in Auto ISO, high contrast, high sharpness, medium saturation, daylight white balance, D-Range shadows and highlights, and 7 megapixels. EV adjustments are rarely necessary thanks to D-Range processing. Leaving it at -0.3 appears to work well most of the time.If I'm in a photographically ideal situation, I'll turn off D-Range and go to ISO 64 at 12 megapixels. (The lower limit with D-Range on is ISO 125.)The tripod mount is centered, so the camera won't easily tip over with mini-tripods. I use a mini-tripod as a camera grip for more stability. It compensates for the P80's small size and light weight.The camera has some purple fringing issues, so I can't give it 5 stars. They're easy to take care of in editing. I bought the thing mainly for black and white, so purple fringing doesn't matter much to me.I tried its highest saturation setting and would not recommend it for normal, colorful scenery. None of the color channels blew out, but maximized blue skies and sunlit green plants looked too weird for my taste. High saturation would work better with drab subjects to bring out more color than the eye sees.", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "S. Ishman \"rock doc\"", "ReviewID": "R1FXRBNQDK9AZT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have used this camera for a couple of weeks and have found it to be a great buy.  I wanted a very compact camera to carry basically anywhere and this fit the bill.  It has a wide range of options that I am still trying to master.  One negative I have found so far, and it may be user error, is the pictures blur very easily as the magnification is increased.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Karmin", "ReviewID": "R2IZVHJ0VBZ5IF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a novice, and I use it for family pictures and videos.  It does the job perfectly!  The Pentax brand stands up well to the beating delivered by a family with several toddlers and young children.  I like all of the settings, helping me to be a better photographer than I actually am.  My only difficulty with the camera is that one of the settings delivers two flashes, so my family would forget and moves as soon as the first flash occured.  With several reminders, though, my family has gotten used to it, so now our pictures turn out beautifully!  Plus, if I just use a different setting, it's not a problem!  One thing I really like: my old Pentax wouldn't take pictures of my son playing b-ball in a gym very well.  This model does a great job of taking indoor photos of moving objects with the proper amount of flash!", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best compact I've ever owned!", "Author": "lab-rat", "ReviewID": "R3HFMA09XM0ANZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera for a year, and I have never been disappointed.  The picture quality is amazing; I get comments all the time on how clear and high quality my photos are.  I have taken pictures with this camera in Utah, Washington, Nevada, DC, Virginia, New York, Alabama, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic... waterfalls, deserts, people, animals, snow, sun, beach, forest, ocean, overcast, indoor... you name it, I've tried it.  And almost always I am pleased with the outcome. I have owned 8 compact digital cameras as well as 2 digital SLRs, and this is by far my favorite.  It's so sleek and small, I take it everywhere and use it daily.  I've dropped it a few times and it doesn't have a scratch.  The color is classic and even a bit glamorous.  The picture modes are maybe a little overkill, but they're also fun to use in different situations.  My father (photographer) and sister (not a photographer) now own this as well, and are just as pleased with the ease and quality.  I HIGHLY suggest buying this camera!!!", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, great photos!

Kuntemeier \"TKE Drew\"", "ReviewID": "R5QUWNB2UG2ZC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall, I'm happy with this camera.  The \"shortcomings\" I list below don't affect me very much.  It has way more modes than are necessary, but once you find which ones you really need, you can just ignore the rest (like the mode for photographing food dishes).There are three shortcomings for this camera.1- Pictures in low light rooms.  I have tried many modes that are suppose to be made for low light pictures and still can't get very clear images.  You would probably have to use a tripod to keep the camera absolutely still.2- Every so often the camera just locks up.  You have to remove the battery, insert the battery, turn the camera off, then turn the camera back on to be able to start taking pictures again.  This doesn't happen very often but the first time it causes you to miss a picture, you'll be pretty upset with it.3- Video pauses every 10-15 seconds.  I haven't determined yet if this is something I can fix using a different video player.  When video files were transferred to my computer they pause/skip a few frames about every 10-15 seconds.  I don't take much video so this wasn't a big issue for me.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "James Forester", "ReviewID": "R2YKEGKSW9KDJD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the first time I've ever posted a comment about any product, but I'm incredulous thinking how it is possible that on this technological era a company can launch to the market a product like this. I thought that whatever the price this level of quality was a thing of the past. This camera is simply terrible; you can never and will never get a decent shot. Every image is horribly oversaturated and video looks like cheap VGA, also terribly oversaturated. I know it was the cheapest with HD video, but even thou it's not worth the price. After a few minutes walking with the camera in my camera case the Optio was already scratched, both the front cheap plastic and the LCD. Yes, walking with it inside the camera case. Surely the camera has a lot of modern shooting modes, but they may be considered as an entertainment, because whatever mode one chooses quality is the same and there are absolutely no differences between images taken with different selections. Face recognition?! If you try to focus someone and there's some object with a strong colour next to that person, the autofocus will concentrate on the object instead. And this happens in any mode; the camera always locks the auto-focus where you don't want it. Try to photograph a pet or any large object, the auto-focus will lock on the middle point or somewhere that it incomprehensibly chooses and the pet head or the rest of the large object will come out totally blurred.After just about a week using this camera I got a blank screen and a lens error message. I got scared because this happened with the Fuji FinePix F10 that beautifully served me for 5 years, some time before it passed out. But hey, if the lenses stop responding you can always use it as a card reader; an expensive one.By mentioning Fuji, if you want an under $100 camera working on AA's my advice would be that you pay only $10 more than for this Optio and buy a new Fuji FinePix AX200 series. For $10 more you'll get 12 MP instead of 10, a 5X zoom instead of 3, HD video at 24fps instead of 15, you'll get a 28mm \"wide\" angle lens instead of the 32mm of the Pentax and the better Fuji image quality. Sure, you'll be surprised with the strange noises that imamate from the movement of the lenses, reason why Fuji suppressed sound recording during video shooting while zooming, but the end result of picture and video quality is way much better than with this camera.And you cannot use the zoom with the Optio while filming, anyway.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "I ended up returning this camera", "Author": "J.
