It has a faster CMOS chip which will give you better low light picture quality.  This was my biggest complaint with the SX210is.Update: 7-19-2010 The video that I posted today is to answer questions about the camera's cycle rate.  It is not an overall camera review but a demonstration of how long it takes the shutter to fire and a demonstration of the \"wicked fast\" continuous mode.  I posted the continuous mode photos on my Google Picasa account which can be viewed by going to my Amazon profile page.I am a professional motion picture camera assistant and an advanced hobby photographer.  I own a Nikon D90 and several other compact cameras.  There are times that I wanted to bring a decent camera but didn't want to haul my SLR kit around with me.  I have always felt like I had to make a big compromise until now.  This camera captures amazing images for such a compact device.  If wanted it also allows for full control of all aspects of your shots including ASA, shutter time and aperture. The HD video it captures is fantastic and it does this without the need to hand focus like my D90.The first thing that you will notice when you get the camera is that it is very small.  It is the size camera you can put in a belt case and forget you have it with you.Controls - I am use to more direct access to the controls but anyone who is familiar with SLR photography can easily navigate the controls without a manual.  Amateurs or those unfamiliar with SLR controls have two great options, Auto or EZ mode.  You can put this camera into the hands of an inexperienced photographer and if they can compose a shot, and have fundamental consideration of lighting, they can get technically great pictures.Colors are accurate with excellent black detail for this price range camera.  This camera achieves a level of image quality that was available only from professional SLR cameras a few years ago.Once you turn on the camera, you are going to be impressed with the wide end of this cameras lens.  For vista shots, it does not show wide lens distortion.  For close wide shots, it does show an acceptable amount distortion that is fun to shoot with.  When I took this camera on a family trip, I was easily able to hold the camera myself and get all 4 of us in the shot.  The only issue that I have with this wide mode is that it will not fully translate in a standard 4X6 print.  You will loose the sides of the pictures when you print.  I hope that the 16X9 HD ratio will become a standard for future photo prints.  Of course you can set the camera to shoot a standard 4X6 printThe long end of the zoom is equally amazing.  The image stabilization seems as good as Nikon's VR system.The SX210is focuses almost as quickly as my SLR Nikon D90 in still mode.Contunuous Mode- The camera can record 2 FPS in continuous mode.  It is a lot of fun to record action sequences or take a series of photos if you have the need to grab a lot of shots in a short time. I posted a few series of shots on my Google Picasa site that can be viewed through my profile page, or paste:[...]Movie Mode - The camera really shines in video mode, it focuses quickly and tracks action well. This Canon camera can continuously focus the image rather than having to press the button halfway to activate focus.In video mode, the exposure shifts in steps rather than gradual transitions.  In other words, the exposure could be good for a particular scene and as it transitions to a different lighting scenario the exposure clicks to the proper exposure.  Dedicated video cameras transition more smoothly between different lighting conditions than still camera shooting in video mode.It shoots 720p movies that rival a dedicated video camera.  The optical 14X zoom is amazing.  This camera could take the place of a stand-alone video camera for many people.  The audio quality is good but not fantastic. You can notice the steady shot while shooting videos.  It works well until you get to long end of the lens where you will notice that the image jumps around when you try to hold a steady frame.  In reality, you would never want to shoot zoomed in all the way.Con's- I'm getting picky here but you should know...I would have liked a viewfinder. Shooting in bright sunlight can be difficult with the LCD screen.  I also find that resting the camera against your head helps steady shots.I wasn't really crazy about the exposed LCD screen.  The screen is made of glass rather than plastic, which is nice.  If placed LCD side down it does not rest flat on the screen.  It instead rests on the mode rotary dial and the opposite corner of the camera.  I wish manufactures would engineer a slightly raised screen bezel to prevent scratches to the screen.I think it could have been better if the microphones were in front of, rather than on top of the camera.  There isn't enough separation between microphones to realize stereo sound capabilities.  The microphone is very susceptible to wind noise.Low light mode is still slightly noisy compared to the D90.  Don't expect a miracle low light camera and you won't be disappointed.  Still it is a lot better than other compact cameras.  Please see the low light photo I posted.The pop-up flash for the camera is positioned where your left index finger would typically grip the camera.  I keep forgetting to relocate my fingers when I turn on the camera.  It works well for illuminating snapshots.  I have found that it is a bit inconsistent.  Sometimes it gracefully lights shots and other times it performs as a typical compact camera flash.Conclusion:I really love the camera and would purchase it again if I manage to destroy it or loose it.  The zoom range is amazing and very useful. The color this camera captures is realistic and detailed.  It is compact, easy to use and fun to shoot.  It is not equal to a quality SLR camera but is clearly better than all of the compact camera's I have used.  My impression is it's in-between quality in a compact body. It definitely sets a new standard.If you have any questions or want other information that will help improve this review, please leave a comment.  I'd be happy to repost any improvements.My review is intended to give a overall consumer impression of this amazing little camera.  I could have gone on for pages and there are plenty of professional reviews on the internet if you want to find out very specific information.Don't forget to order a case or SD card when you order this camera as it comes with neither.SD CARDSI tried SD cards that ranged from a class 2 Panasonic to a class 10 SanDisk 30MB/s.  It didn't make a lot of difference in the cycle rate the camera was able to shoot at.I have 4 Transcend 8 Gig Class 10 cards that I primarily use with this camera.  10 Mbs write 16Mbs read.  I would recommend them because they are a good value and download at a reasonably fast pace.  If you decide to the card in the future for another application (like a video camera) you won't be stuck with a slow card that is obsolete.BATTERIESIf you get a spare battery get the OEM Canon Battery.  I was tempted to save and bought the Lenmar replacement battery. I would suggest you save your money.  After the first few cycles it would read full on the camera's battery indicator but not be able to power the camera.CASESThe Canon PSC-3100 PowerShot Case for Canon SX200IS Digital Cameras is really too large for this camera.  See the posted pictures on Amazon's consumer photos.  I went to an electronics store and tried all of the cases. I liked the Lowepro D-Pods 20 best. Amazon sells it for $9.23 and it's Amazon Prime too. This case is snug fitting and offers spare battery and card storage. I posted some snapshots and a video.Avoid the temptation to put a compact camera unprotected in a jacket pocket.  The dust and dirt contained within can work itself into the camera and optics.  There is no easy way to address this.I posted a video review there also.Lowepro D-Pods 20 Camera Case (Black)Lowepro D-Pods 20 Camera Case (Black)Some sample photos are at my Picasa account that can be found in my profile page.", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "My thoughts on SX210 + update", "Author": "R. Murdock", "ReviewID": "R2CTTCCTQL4Y9S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off - background on me and what I was looking for:  I would classify myself as an intermediate photographer.  I own a Nikon DSLR which I use primarily for low light situations having learned the hardway at my son's 18th birthday that my old point-and-shoot did a lousy job of photos in low light situations.  I am planning a trip to Europe in the fall and simply did not want to lug my Nikon camera around with me along with all the other stuff - like map, dictionary, travel guide - that I would have to take with me as I wandered around whatever town I was in.  So I started my search for a really good PNS camera.  What was I looking for in the PNS ?  My goal in picture taking is to have a terrific photo of what I actually saw.  So when I got home and looked at the photo, I would say:  Yes, that's exactly what it looked like when I was there.  So onto my criteria:  First size.  I wanted it to be small enough to fit comfortably in a pocket.  Second, confidence that it would take good to great photos under normal (not low-light) conditions.  Third, I liked the idea of HD videos of my trip, so I wanted that capability.  Fourth and finally, at least decent performance in low light conditions as I expected to frequently want to take photos inside a museum or art gallery.The search turned out to be much more difficult than I had expected.  Frustratingly difficult I will add.  No one camera is loved by all reviewers.  So those of you reading this review, who are still searching, I feel your pain.  I came to the conclusion that currently there is no perfect PNS that does it all.  I would do hours of research on the web and then go to the local camera store to actually play with the PNS cameras that had caught my interest. In the end I concluded that there are 3 or 4 reasonably good PNS cameras out there, but all of them required me to compromise on something I wanted.  So figure out what your must-haves are and sort through the available cameras accordingly.Obviously I chose the Canon SX210.  I have had it about 3 weeks now and have taken about 200 photos and about 6 HD movies.  My comments in no particular order:1.  the Canon does a good but not outstanding job of taking photos under normal daylight conditions.  I did play with several photos on my computer and kept zooming in on a particular point to see when the picture would deteriorate.  Of course it did eventually, but again, since 8.5 x 11 is the max size I expect for any enlargement, I do not see any problem with the picture quality.2.  the HD video capability is more fun than I had expected.  Again as already noted, the mic's are located on the top of the camera.  Great for recording my commentary, but not so good for recording sounds coming from whatever you are videoing.  One other point:  the Canon allows you to zoom in while taking an HD video.  That's great, but with 14X optical zoom, the more you zoom, the more susceptible the camera and the video you are taking is to shaking.  If you zoom all the way to 14X, I found it impossible to avoid shaking when holding the camera in my hand.  At no zoom, there is no problem with shake when taking a video.  Bottom line:  limit your zooming in when taking a video.3.  I agree with everyone else that placement of the pop-up flash and the telephoto zoom in-and-out mechanism is NUTS.  What were the Canon engineers thinking ?  However both are annoyances rather than deal-breakers.4.  the battery life is reasonable but not outstanding.  I never ran out of battery life during a day of shooting photos and the battery re-charges in about 2-3 hours.  Not bad.5.  Speed - I bought 2 Sandisk Extreme III 4 GB Class 6 SD disks.  I agree with the suggestions that you have to step up to a Class 6 disk to avoid serious delays when writing the photo to the disk.  I also decided against one 8GB disk since I did not want all my pics on one disk.  Back to speed - I also turned off the automatic review after each photo taken, and found that improved the speed of the picture taking noticeably.  You can also turn on continuous picture taking and take a \"burst\" of photos if so desired.  Bottom Line:  speed is fast enough for my needs.6.  Definitely buy a plastic shield (or cover?) to protect the 3\" LCD screen on the back.  The Apple Store has them if you can't find them cheaper any place else.7.  The camera feels surprisingly heavy to me.  But solid.  I guess 14X optical zoom does create some weight.8.  I set the camera on 9MP pictures since 14MP is overkill for me.  I would never enlarge a photo to more than 8.5 x 11 anyway.  I left the movie on HD settings however.  Dumming down the photos to 9MP also improves the write-to-disk speed BTW.9.  Expect a serious learning curve with this camera.  I printed out the manual from the PDF file and it is 180 pages.  Not all was relevant to me and my interests, but still I have spent several hours reading and re-reading sections of the manual.  Since I will not take the manual with me on my upcoming trip, I have to know how to manipulate this camera.10. The 14X optical zoom is really impressive.  While that was not a top consideration for me, having that capability is very cool.  You can easily zoom in to an amazing degree on something from a considerable distance away.11.  Low-light - I am still working on this one and how to manipulate the camera to get the best LL photos.  In dim lighting it does OK - by upping the ISO, so you pay a price in the quality of the photo.  In the black of night - it does OK if the subject of the photo is not more than 6-8 ft away from you.  But I tried a photo at night of the moon shining off the Pacific ocean from my balcony and that did not work. Not a real surprise, but like I said, I need to experiment more in this area.In summary - I would describe this camera as being a really solid good versatile PNS.  You can put it on full Auto and snap away happily, or switch to one of several pre-defined settings (landscape, portrait etc), or if you are really into it, go all the way to completely manual and set everything yourself.  That's not for me - but you do have that capability.  The HD Videos are great, but even a short one takes up about 80-90MB of disk space.  And as noted, you are unlikely to pick up the sounds from whatever it is you are videoing.  PS:  I have never encountered the much discussed problem with lens shadow.All-in-all a solid performer in an amazingly small form factor that will do what I am looking for and more on my upcoming trip to Europe.10/10/2010 update:  Just returned from my 3 week trip to Europe and wanted to update my review.  Took about 1,500 photos and about 30 movies.  And right now I am in the midst of reviewing them on my home computer.  So how did the Canon perform ?  It was terrific.  First off - I really appreciated the small form factor on the trip.  It easily fit into a slot in my messenger bag that I used on the trip or into a front pants pocket.  I was able to quickly retrieve it and snap photos very rapidly.  Never missed a shot I wanted to take.  Second - the zoom feature turned out to be very useful when I wanted to take a photo of something in a museum or art gallery along with 1,000 other tourists.  I would stand as tall as I could and zoom in over the heads of the crowd and 90% of the time could snap a great photo.  Third - I took a lot of photos inside churches and art museums where flash was not permitted.  Especially stained glass windows in several cathedrals.  When I took the photo I could tell from the sound of the shutter, that the camera was using a very slow shutter speed.  Most times I was taking the photo with only my hands to hold the camera - and always hoping that the image stabilization software would do a good job.  Now that I am home I can tell you that the IS software did a remarkable job.  I have had to delete about 5-10 photos at most.  It truly is impressive.  Fourth - the movie feature turned out to be very worthwhile.  As I look at the movies now, I am impressed with how faithfully the camera captured what I was viewing at the time.  Fifth - battery life was terrific.  Never had any problem during the day when I would be taking the photos.  However I did recharge the battery most every night.  Overall - for me and what I am looking for in a point and shoot camera with a compact form factor - the Canon SX210 turned out to be a perfect choice.  Highly recommended.", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "It's all about the zoom", "Author": "Iowadad", "ReviewID": "R39R2Z50SIOZNY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very fun compact camera.  I don't believe they upgraded the sensor from previous Powershot cameras so the picture quality isn't a miracle or anything.  What is really cool about the sx 210 is the zoom lens.  I get shots with this camera that just wouldn't have been possible with my old Elf.  There is such a huge difference between using the true optical zoom on this or the digital zoom of my old camera.  In that way, there is sort of an increase in picture quality because I can get in close on my subject and not have to crop my pictures and lose resolution later.The video function is also a plus.  The sound from the stereo mic is decent and, again, the zoom lens really comes into play in terms of the shots you can get.  I've shot videos of my kids on stage, clear across a large hall, and really come up with some nice clips.I haven't used the manual settings on this camera as much as I thought I would.  I've found it difficult to focus accurately or quickly enough with the little wheel.  I play with it sometimes for macro shots and such but, primarily, I've used the automatic function to good effect.  Someone who wants to spend the time and play with the various functions and gimmicks will probably enjoy this quite a bit.  I tend to have my hands full these days and it has been very useful as a point and shoot, enhanced significantly by the ability to zoom in close.The pop-up flash takes some getting used to but over time I've come to like that feature.  There are a lot of times I don't want the flash to fire and it's nice to be able to just snap it shut or hold it shut as you turn on the camera.  It becomes second nature eventually.", "Date": "April 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nearly perfect all-around point and shoot!", "Author": "Volchitsa", "ReviewID": "R22WFUJE2HCBP0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "NOTE: If you are confused about some of the issues brought up in the negative reviews, including the LENS SHADOW ISSUE, please read my commentary under the UPDATE section at the end of this review and feel free to ask any additional questions.___________________________________________________________________REVIEWPeople have already written excellent reviews for the black version of this camera and, obviously, everything applies to the Gold version as well. I will summarize my own experience with the camera and update the review as I learn more. Feel free to ask any questions.I am a hobbyist and own a Canon DSLR with some high end lenses and accessories. It's a great setup, but because of its size and weight I rarely have it with me. I got sick of missed opportunities and knew I needed a pocket camera to take with me everywhere.I've owned a Canon Powershot SX110IS 9MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) previously and thought it was great, which is why I considered getting the Canon PowerShot SX120IS 10MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Images Stabilized Zoom and 3-inch LCD this time. However, it's not pocketable, so I've also considered the amazing Canon PowerShot S90 10MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-inch LCD, Panasonic DMC-LX3 10.1MP Digital Camera with 24mm Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black), and Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX1/H 10MP \"Exmor R\" CMOS Digital Camera with 3-inch Touch-Screen LCD (Grey). These are all great on their own, but lack the zoom, and Sony also lacks manual modes. When I finally saw an SX210 at a local store, I almost bought it on the spot. It's pocketable yet boasts 14x optical zoom and all the benefits of the SX120 plus more!Color: The Gold color is actually quite pleasant. It isn't the \"bling\" bright yellow gold as it might appear on pictures. It's a softer champagne-like gold that I personally love. It's perfect if you want something unique, yet not obnoxious. I was excited that Canon provides a color choice for this camera.Size: The SX210 isn't as tiny as some Elphs or other manufacturer's (like Sony) pocket cams, yet it's borderline pocketable and quite light. I can put it in the back pocket of fitted jeans comfortably, although I definitely recommend a pouch (it won't fit into my back pocket with a pouch though).Design: Nothing special about the design, but it looks classy and serious. Looks much more substantial than the somewhat plasticky SX1XX line. There aren't many buttons, but it's enough for easy and fast operation. If you've used Canon point and shoots before, you'll find the interface familiar, although it looks more sleek and refined than the slightly outdated SX110 interface.The control (not the mode) dial is actually not physically labeled. BUT when the camera is on, touching the control dial slightly will display the functions of the buttons. Touch the left side of the dial and it will highlight the function for the left button and bring up a brief description. This allows for a dynamic arrangement of functions in various modes and although it took a little getting used to, I'm a big fan.The mode dial is way too stiff for my liking and requires two fingers to operate. At least it won't change accidentally...The flash position did startle me at first, but now I don't mind it at all. Yes, your finger is over the flash and it tries to pop up when you turn the camera on. However, the finger will suppress the flash popping up, and most of the time you don't want flash up anyway. So it's strange, but it works out in the end.Screen: I would prefer a regular aspect ratio screen to the wide one on the SX210. It's catered towards HD video, but I use it more for pictures, so with the black borders around pictures it effectively becomes a 2.5\" screen. But it's a minor drawback and the screen is gorgeous otherwise. It's much more accurate in terms of colors and exposure than the Sony TX1 screen I've tried.There isn't much of a bezel around it, so I'd recommend a screen protector. (Don't use those film ones, use a stiff glass or plastic one. There are many available on amazon and ebay - you don't need a specifically SX210 one, just get one big enough and cut it to size. What I did is get a screen protector from a local Verizon store - they have nice stiff ones for the touchscreen phones like Droid and cost only $12 for 3 of them. When the protector is on, it looks exactly like the screen without a protector, which cannot be said about those film ones).Operation: It's not the fastest camera around and the zoom is a little slow, although smooth. I've found it to be just fine for everyday shooting and the smooth zooming works great on videos (with other cams I'd often overshoot). As I said, the interface is in line with most Canon's point and shoots.Image quality: Canon rarely disappoints in this aspect. The images are perfectly sharp (unlike the Sony TX1) and the colors are vivid yet accurate (unlike some Panasonic and Sony cameras). At lowest ISOs and regular conditions, the quality rivals some DLSRs. As in many point and shoots, noise becomes visible starting at ISO 400, but that's the price you pay for a 14x optical zoom. Low light pictures are not as good as the lead cameras' such as the S90, but they're not any worse than most point and shoots and are just fine for printing.Lens: The lens is in line with most point and shoots today (f/3.1 to f/5.9). The zoom is very smooth (and you can control the speed), although a little slow. 14x is amazing and image stabilization works great. No noticeable distortion.Flash: Nothing special, average for point and shoots. Good exposure. In auto mode, the camera does a great job trying to balance the background and foreground when using flash. Careful though, it might crank the ISO up to keep detail in the background when you shoot in low light.Video: HD and normal video is great. The same awesome image quality as in picture mode. Videos look crisp and colors are great. The auto focus performs perfectly, works very quickly, and is very accurate even for moving subjects.Many cameras won't allow you to zoom while taking videos, but this isn't a problem with the SX210. Since the camera is so small, camera shake is inevitable, so I would avoid zooming in too much if you're not using a tripod or a monopod. Audio is fine. Stereo audio sounds great on paper, but I don't hear much difference. Note that HD video eats memory cards in no time, so if you're just taping for web or the like, just change it to normal quality.The dedicated video button is very useful to have! Can't tell you how many times I forgot to get into or out of video mode with other cameras. It still has a video mode, it just makes it faster and easier to shoot video on the go.Features: This camera is pretty impressive in terms of features, both the serious ones such as manual modes and the more gimmicky features you see in lots of newer point and shoots cameras today. Here is a summary.-Auto and Easy modes: intelligent scene recognition works great most of the time. Even I use Auto often instead of manual modes as it is very reliable.-Manual, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, Program modes: godsend for point and shoots. You might not think you need them now, but if you start learning about photography more, you'll be glad you have them!-Scene modes: All the general ones like sports and portrait, as well as cool unique ones such as:  -Smart shutter: camera automatically takes the picture when either a smile is detected, a new face is detected, or 2 seconds after a wink is detected. All of these are customizable and work just as described! Very useful for self portraits and such. As a backup, the camera fires after about 15 seconds even if it didn't detect anything, so no missed shots because it didn't recognize a face.  -Low light: Lowers resolution to improve quality. Sets ISO is pretty high. Nothing amazing, but good results.  -Color Accent and Swap: Canon's favorite - isolate a color (with the rest in black and white), or swap two colors)  -Fisheye effect: Look at sample fish eye images online. Just a fun effect. You can control amount of distortion.  -Miniature effect: Nothing like a true tilt-shift, but gets decent results. Blurs parts of image to make an illusion of a miniature. Customizable.  -Stitch assist: helps taking panoramas-My Colors: tinker with colors - can add/subtract saturation or accent reds/greens/blues, can lighten/darken skin tones, etc. Great settings I use a lot.-White Balance: learn to use custom white balance - it's quite painless and yields amazing accuracy in white balance. Use an opaque white object or a white wall to fill the frame, just press a button, and the white balance is set perfectly.-Exposure Compensation for flash and for general exposureBattery: I loved how the SX120 uses AAs (long lasting and easily available), so I was a little skeptical about the SX210. But I wasn't disappointed - the battery started getting low only after a week of moderate usage including many videos. Replacement batteries are very cheap ($5 off-brand).Other:Something else unique about this camera is it recognizes SDXC memory cards - the successor to the SDHC cards that will surely become popular soon. They allow for bigger read/write speeds and capacities of 64GB and more.As with any new gadget, I recommend reading almost the entire manual. I have quite a bit of experience in cameras, and yet I always find something new or peculiar in the manuals. For example, you can press and hold the Disp button and it will bring up the brightness to 100%. Do it again to go back to your custom brightness setting. This is great if you keep the brightness down to save battery, yet need it up when it's bright and you're outdoors. Beats going through menus any day!If you press and hold the center button (Func/Set), the camera will bring up a clock. To do the same from when the camera is off, press the center button and while holding it, press the power button.What I would've liked from other cams incorporated into the SX210:-Faster operation and zoom.-Better low light performance.-Faster lens (f/2 would be great at wide end).-Better macro mode. I miss the SX110's ability to focus at 1cm for gorgeous pictures. SX210 focuses at a comparatively disappointing 5cm.Gimmicks:-Capacitive touch screen for focus points and faster operation.-GPS sensor for geotagging, since this camera is so perfect for travel.-WiFi - to upload pictures onto the web or even onto smartphones on the go.Conclusion:This one is definitely a keeper for me and it will never leave my side, even when I have my DSLR with me!The pros outweigh the cons and this camera definitely beats the competition. The price is right too and will definitely come down soon.Sorry for the very long review, but I am very excited about this find and I hope this helps. Feel free to ask any questions.___________________________________________________________________UPDATE 5/3/2010Re: LENS SHADOW ISSUE from other reviews (A copy of my reply in the discussion of the black version of the camera):Stephen (top review author of the black SX210), AAAA (another owner of the SX210), and myself have all had a frustrating experience with J. Collins. I would not take his reviews into account, as they can be quite misleading. Unfortunately, he does not respond well to logic either. Please instead read about other people's experiences with the camera and ask any other questions you might have from knowledgeable and logical people such as Stephen.From my experience with DSLRs, many point and shoots, and the SX210 itself, the flash shadow issue is MINOR. It is certainly true that the LENS CAN CAST SHADOWS, but:1) As Stephen said, this is INHERENT to many cameras, even top of the line professional ones. It's physics. (Also, forget about using macro mode with flash, NO camera is going to give you even lighting).2) The shadows ONLY appear when there is something within about 1m of the camera on the right side of the frame.3) The shadows CAN BE ELIMINATED easily if you zoom in a little (and stand back to get the same composition if needed).4) ASK YOURSELF: how many times have you taken shots that required flash and which had a subject in the right side of the frame that was closer than 1m to the camera? Look through old pictures to see whether you have indeed been in this situation. If so, ask yourself whether you'd be okay with either cropping the picture or zooming in a little.5) If you find yourself in situations described above often and are not okay with the solutions, then LOOK FOR A DIFFERENT CAMERA. Obviously, a camera with an internal lens will work best. Be prepared to sacrifice optical zoom.6) If this is a minor issue to you (it's not even an issue to me personally) and if you're reading this, you'll probably love this camera as it is one of the best all-around point and shoots around.Re: Battery lifeI'm waiting for some official review with controlled testing to see whether it is really that much worse than AAs. I don't notice a difference myself even though I owned an AA camera, but I don't shoot consistently enough to be sure. The battery life has been fine so far and the batteries are as cheap as rechargeable AAs. Also, it is worth noting that this same battery has been used in other cameras. Although power consumption obviously varies from device to device, it is worth checking out the reviews of other cameras with the same battery. I'll try to research that myself as well.I'll update if I learn more.", "Date": "April 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just about perfect.", "Author": "Mike Pieronek", "ReviewID": "R6DRHON3JAYT8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(This text is posted on my personal website along with sample images and video.[..]I am excited about Canon SX210 IS camera. I read the specs Canon published back in February 2010. It had features I was looking for. I pre-ordered this camera before reading any reviews.Here's what I liked about this camera:- Quality of pictures- HD 720p video- 14x optical zoom with image stabilizer.- Optical zoom functions when shooting video (a biggie)- Mode wheel- Secondary 4-way controller with scroll wheel- Face detectionPhysicalThe SX210 is not a tiny camera like my Casio EX-H10 or even the EX-V7. It's about an inch and a quarter thick including the extension for the lens.  Double the thickness of my Casio EX-H10. It's about half and inch wider than the smaller Casio. It is still very pocketable. But you can't put it in the front pocket of your jeans like you can the thinner Casio. I'm fine with the size. I usually wear carpenter pants with an extra pocket on the side. The camera fits in the extra pocket just fine. Considering the wonderful zoom I have no right to fault the camera size. That said, if you need an ultra compact camera to slide into a narrow pocket, the SX210 IS may not be the right choice.FeaturesThe zoom lens is pretty remarkable. It extends out from the camera about 2.5\". It can shoot a wide angle shot of a building and then zoom in on the door close enough to read the numbers. Check out the clock tower picture in the samples. What incredible range this lens has. It's quiet and smooth as it moves. The zoom has two speeds. It can be hard to move only at the slower speed. The zoom button is quite small. It's hard to hold it with consistent pressure. Is it a problem? No. It's just a trade off with a small camera. The macro mode is excellent too.HD video with zoom was a must for me. I have a Sony HDR-HC5 HDV camcorder. It takes very good videos. Ever since I've had it, the standard def video of my cameras just hasn't been desirable to me anymore. This SX210 shoots video at 720p or 1280 x 720 px. My HDV shoots at 1440 x 1080 px. The video is interlaced. The Canon SX210 video is progressive scan. Overall the Canon video quality is very good. The ability to zoom while shooting is fantastic. I recorded my daughter at her swim class and was able to keep her full frame for the length of the pool.Mode wheel. The more camera's I've had the more I want this feature. I used to love the novelty of the 'on screen' interface. I've grown tired of it. Of course it is necessary because of the enormous number of parameters which can be changed. The mode wheel on this camera can get to selections which are 10 menu button clicks deep on the Casio. I like the Portrait, Landscape, and Movie are points on this wheel. So just by turning this knob to the icon the camera switches into this mode immediately. In bright sunlight I don't have to even look at the screen to know I'm a new mode. The movie mode on the knob is great, but Canon did one better and made a dedicated movie button. When you're in any mode you can click the red button and immediately start shooting movies. Casio has always done this and I love the feature. The red button is configurable to do a variety of things, movie mode is the default.The camera has, what is now a standard, 4-way control disc. You click up, down, left and right with a select button in the middle. The 4-way controller on this Canon is also a scroll wheel. So when you are moving between pictures in playback mode you can quickly shoot between images by turning the wheel quickly with your thumb. This scroll wheel is used to navigate the camera menus too. The optical zoom controller also works in playback mode. You can zoom back so 50+ thumbnails are on screen. All actions are very very quick. No lag or waiting for the images to display and move.The flash is great too. Not for it's performance, though it seemed to work fine. I didn't really test it much. I like the way it works. It pops up when the camera is turned on. 90% of the time when I turn the camera on my finger is on top of the flash and it doesn't pop up. Not a problem, blocking it doesn't harm it. If I need it I just pull it up to turn it on. I like this very obvious and direct control over the flash. I don't like to have to click a menu 4 times to turn it on or off. Many times I'm at a venue where flash isn't allowed. Using an on screen menu isn't nearly as obvious pushing the flash down and knowing with certainty it will not fire.The SX210 has great face detection. I like this feature because it draws green boxes around faces it recognizes and guarantees the face you want will likely be in focus. I know many many cameras do this, but this one seems quicker to find the faces and focus. The wink shutter is a neat idea. We tried it and had to wink several times to invoke it. I'm sure with practice I could make it work more reliably. It's fun but also a feature I'm unlikely to use often. Still fun to play with. Smile shutter takes pictures automatically any time it sees a smile. This could be fun to set up for a party. I find it incredible that a camera now truly 'sees' what it's taking pictures of. It recognized the face of a statue I took a picture of, as well.The camera has continuous focus. Instead of pushing the shutter button halfway down to force focus the SX210 is always focusing. I like it.I've had the camera less than a week. I still have more to learn about it. The menu structure is simple with the AUTO setting or deep with the manual modes. I think this camera is a wonderful choice for someone who wants a camera and a video camcorder. It does both very well.I highly recommend the Canon SX210 IS. It's a very enjoyable camera to use.", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Canon PowerShot I Have Ever Owned!", "Author": "sevenzeroseven", "ReviewID": "R2TSYM28T1P0AV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited for a while to see what was up with Amazon's release date. I have a huge European vacation coming up in a couple weeks, so I couldn't wait much longer to get used to a new camera. I surfed on over to Best Buy and there it was...with Free Shipping and I am loving this camera!  Best point-and-shoot I have ever owned.This is now my third Canon PowerShot.  I am by no means getting rid of my SD750 though - great camera, but there is 2x's the pixel and zoom in the SX210IS.  I never thought that I was going to have a point-and-shoot with image stabilization like my Nikon D90 has.  The red-eye correction works best if the setting is to reduce DURING the photo taking.The 3\" LCD is so clear and so the colors are bright.  The video capability is just uhm... WOW!  I thought the SD750 took amazing video, but the video this camera takes is mind-blowing.  I filmed some of us at our softball training tonight and if I could - I would show you how amazing the videos came out.  I am using a 16GB Transcend Class 6 card and the download time was pretty fast.  I had about 17 minutes total.Zoom zoom zoommm (did that sound like a Mazda commercial?) The zoom was also tested at my softball game.  I zoomed in on my friend out in left field and the Red Sox logo was CLEAR!  There was a bit of grain, but when I say 'bit' - it was so minimal.Day photos - vivid, clear, and overall superb quality.  Low-light - great quality and the best that I have seen in any point-and-shoot - just let it do the right focusing and you have some decent photos. Night - it was pretty dark before softball was over tonight.  I walked over to the dugout and just started randomly taking shots at some objects where it was pitch dark - they came out like it was DAY!  I the arranged a softball, bat bag, and glove about 60 feet away from me and zoomed, well - the photo came out clear, bright (but not overdone) and way better than I ever expected.I now joke that this camera has higher MP than my DSLR.  My Nikon D90 is a 12.1 and this is 14.1 - I honestly never thought that I would have a non-DSLR that had these options, but Canon surely has made a great choice in this area!Overall, I am extremely happy with this camera.  It was well worth $350 for a compact point-and-shoot.  I will be looking forward to seeing more reviews since there are only six (including mine) as of now.Hope you enjoyed my review & hope you choose this camera!", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good P&S; with good image quality and low light performance", "Author": "Rick in Virginia", "ReviewID": "R28JL3A633OG4L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I compared this camera to the Panny zs3 (in lieu of the zs7 which wasn't available at the time), and the Sony hx5v. I did buy and use all three cameras to do this test. You can only go by reviews written by others to a certain point, and then you need to see for yourself. The canon won out after hundreds of photographs were taken and compared among the three cameras. Here's why:1. Panasonic zs3.-The overall image quality on the panasonic just wasn't that good.-Low light performance and IQ was very poor.-The form factor was good-I didn't like the fact that the battery was expensive, proprietary and had a firmware bit that made 3rd party batteries inoperable, meaning that a spare battery was a $40 expense.-Several photography sites have stated that the IQ of the zs7 was not as good as the zs3. Therefore, the zs7 was out of contention.-While gps is interesting, I have managed all these years to go without it and don't believe that it adds much to the package.2. Sony hx5v-burst mode at a maximum of 10 fps is very nice. The downside is that the camera does in fact take 17+ seconds to process all that data and during that time you cannot take a photo.-Hand held twilight is nice, though IQ is average-Anti blur motion is also nice, again, IQ is average-25mm wide angle (at 35mm equivalent)is nice.-Form factor is okay, however, the microphones for the video are poorly placed and are exactly where your fingers fall when videoing.-Flash is weak and shows up off centered if you shoot with a wide angle-No iris - uses a neutral density filter to achieve an ersatz f-stop. Therefore, you get one depth of field for all photos.-With the ND filter, you get only 2 f-stops.-Image quality was poor at any magnification. Heavy use of noise reduction obliterates and smears detail in the photo. For desktop viewing and small prints this won't be a problem.-the lcd screen was just about useless in very low light. And since the camera has no view finder, you have to guess what is properly framed or not.-poor white balance.--While I did take video with the camera I didn't fully evaluate it since I was not pleased with the stills. However, the low light video at late dusk and around the house was dark and flat and not really viewable.- as with the Panasonic, gps really isn't important to me and I'd be paying for something I don't see a use for having.3. Canon sx210 is-good image quality, some noise above ISO 200, but correctable with Neat Image-I thought the 14x zoom would be too much, in fact, it is nice to have.-It would be nice to have 25mm on the wide angle end and reduce it to 12x on the tele end.-burst mode is not too bad with a fast card (SD Class 6)...cycles at 0.7 seconds. Nowhere near as fast as the Sony at 10fps, but gets the job done. Importantly, you can continue to take photos until the card fills and it is never \"busy\" processing images. So there is a trade off. With the Sony, you get 10 shots in a second and have to wait 17 - 20 seconds to take the next shot. Or with the Canon you get about 4 frames in 3 seconds and you can just keep shooting. To me, that was somewhat important since the photo I might really want could occur soon after I used the burst mode on the Sony and I'd just have to watch it go by.-very good low light performance in manual mode or auto mode-much brighter lcd screen for viewing in low light. Low light video far better than the Sony.-the fact that you can manually close the flash is great in my opinion. Several reviewers have complained about it - however, I like it because when it is closed, it is off. In other P&S; cameras, depending on how I would change the shooting mode among program, auto and others, the flash may become active without me thinking about it. And at times when flash is not allowed nothing is worse than having a flash go off. With the sx210, when the flash is off, it is off.-video is very good as is sound quality. The hd is in 720p and that is just fine, and when viewed on TV, it looks great.-I do think that the form factor could be improved - give me a little something to grip. It's not bad, but it could be improved.-A low light mode is available that pushes the ISO to 3200. It gets the picture, but it is certainly noisy (clean up with Neat Image).-somewhere in this camera the cost savings for not implementing gps is made up somewhere else. I think it is image quality.The Canon sx210 won out - primarily because of image quality. Some of the features on the Sony were very nice and I had to give it a lot of consideration before keeping the Canon and returning the Sony. But in the end, a camera is all about the image and when taken with the other capabilities of the camera, that nod goes to Canon.UPDATE later this same day: While thinking on the burst mode question and thinking of a work-around I experimented and checked the burst mode in different shooting modes, compressions and resolution and found that if you shoot in the low light option (within the scene mode) you can get about 3-4 fps with resolution of 3.5MP. It isn't 12MP, but it isn't bad either and the results are quite okay. And outdoors with good light the noise is dramatically reduced due to a high shutter speed.", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lens Shadow FTL", "Author": "J.

You can, of course, still post your questions in hopes that someone else more seasoned than myself will be able to offer an answer.  Good luck in finding the camera that best suits your needs =).THE REVIEW:This camera takes decent photos with one MAJOR exception that I will discuss later. However, it teeters right along the outer boundaries of the point-and-shoot category as it definitely requires you to get to know about ISO, shutter speed, aperture, and various other advanced camera options if you want to take the best photos.I am also satisfied with the video quality, although I was expecting better for HD. It seems that the only thing high def about the video is the actual pixel dimensions.  It certainly doesn't produce true high def quality. Instead, it is grainy and lacking in clarity. With digital cameras, unnecessarily high pixel dimensions in video should be sacrificed for better quality. Leave true high def for camcorders and other video devices that can actually take advantage of the technology and keep the digital camera res to 640x480 unless it's actually capable of true high def. If not, call it like it is and advertise it as \"wide screen\" since, in reality, that's really all it is.  I'm just trying to help others avoid the same misconception I had when I saw \"high def video\" since, to me, high def means high def.And now for the nitty gritty! I've since purchased and returned two SX210s, both of which were notorious for producing the lens shadow phenomenon caused by the position of the flash and the length at which the lens barrel extends from the camera.  This combination of poor design implementation creates the potential for the SX210's lens barrel to actually block the flash, resulting in a shadow of itself being cast in the lower right corner of your photo.You might be thinking that all you have to do to is either retract the lens barrel to keep it out of the way if you don't need the zoom or simply turn off the flash.  Both are certainly ideal solutions, but, unfortunately, retracting the lens barrel is not an option and the SX210 does poorly in low-light environments without a flash.  The net result is an uncompromising camera that greatly limits itself in the conditions in which it can be used effectively.In spite of the fierce opposition you see me faced with in discussions here, I think most of you will identify with the shooting positions I demonstrate in my video review.  I am certain that everyone has had those moments when they wanted to pick up their camera on a whim and take a picture of a friend, pet, or whatever other subject happened to be photogenic at the time.  With the SX210, however, something so simple as taking a picture of a friend next to you on your couch can result in a fudged photo.Summary: I initially chose the SX210 because I simply wanted an all-around good camera. It was a major disappointment to me when I realized that I had to be conscious of where I was standing in order to avoid the lens shadow. Having to retake a photo because I happened to be too close to a wall or couch cushion was largely irritating, especially since this is a point-and-shoot, not a professional-grade SLR.I wish Canon implemented smarter design with the SX210 rather than resorting to the numbers game. 14 megapixels with such a small image sensor? Boasting high def video when it doesn't produce true high def quality? 14x optical zoom with a lens barrel so big it that blocks the flash?Canon, let's do better next time, shall we?", "Date": "May 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Compact Zoom Camera", "Author": "S. J. Simmons", "ReviewID": "R1PN8U6G8L0H4U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera has just the feature set I wanted, and using it is a truly enjoyable experience.  The best feature of the camera has to be the nice, sharp 14x wide angle zoom lens (28mm-392mm equivalent).  While not the fastest lens Canon makes (f/3.1 at 28mm; compare to the S95's f/2.0 lens), it's very sharp and the camera seems to focus quickly, especially in well lit situations.  The lens zooms  by a small lever on the top of the camera--that's a design feature that likely will take some getting used to.  It's a departure from the normal lever that surrounds the shutter.  I personally like the traditional design better, but this works just fine.The camera also sports the ability to take HD movies (720p).  I wanted this feature to take videos of my children, but I've found it very useful in other situations as well.  My main photographic interest is nature photography, and my DSLR is too old to take movies, so I now take this with me to shoot HD video of the scenes I shoot with my DSLR.  Because it lets you set your video exposure manually, you can pan the camera while shooting to achieve a nice, even exposure.  This was a nice, unexpected benefit to the camera.The manual controls are also fairly accessible.  There's dial that controls the on screen menus, and because the operations change in different shooting modes, they aren't printed on the camera, but if you touch the dial, they will appear on screen, and it's very easy to manually set the shutter speed, aperture, ISO and many other features.  Unfortunately, the camera does not allow you to move the center focusing point to a desired position on the LCD screen. I don't know why they left this feature out, since it's helpful when using a tripod, and my older S3IS had that ability.  But you're not likely to use this camera on a tripod often, so it's very easy to focus on the center point and recompose when you need to, so I haven't really missed this feature.  When shooting people, you can set the camera to automatically focus on people's faces, and you can even choose a mode that will take the picture when everyone in the photograph is smiling.The design of the camera is very compact, slim and attractive.  The largest complaint I've seen with the camera is that the flash automatically pops up when you turn on the camera, and if your finger is covering the flash, it will keep it from popping up.  This was annoying to me at first, but I quickly learned to either hold the flash down when I don't want it or keep my finger off the flash when I do.  And the flash can be manually raised or lowered at at any time, so it's not a big deal either way.  The LCD screen is bright and colorful and LARGE.  It takes up almost the entire back of the camera, which is very nice.My biggest gripe with the camera is that Canon decided to cram 14 mega-pixels into the tiny sensor.  This has to be little more than a marketing device.  With a sensor size this small, crowding this many pixels into the sensor only increases noise, and then Canon compensates for the noise by running noise reduction, which then lowers the sharpness of the image.  So there's no significant gain in overall picture quality by raising the resolution of the sensor.  I wish Canon would have used the same 10 mega-pixel sensor they used in the s90 with this camera.  I suspect the image quality would be significantly better.That said, the image quality of this camera is pretty darn good.  Especially at low ISOs (80-200), this camera performs very well.  As you raise the ISO into the 400-1600 range, noise becomes a more significant factor, and Canon's noise reduction causes the image to lose detail.  Because of this, I rarely use the automatic modes in lower light situations because I don't trust the camera to choose the ISO for me.  I'd rather choose it myself and keep it at 400 or lower if possible.  I've been very pleased with my results.When I take this camera with me on nature shoots, I now frequently take roughly the same shot with this camera and compare my results to what I achieved with my DSLR.  Of course, my 10 mega-pixel Canon 40D shooting in RAW is noticeably superior to what this camera can produce.  The 40D is significantly sharper, has less noise, better color, and so on.  This shouldn't be surprising.  At the same time, however I suspect if I printed out both shots as an 8\"x10\" print, you'd be hard pressed to see the difference.  With the noise reduction abilities of Lightroom 3, I'd be more than willing to shoot with this camera when I don't have my DSLR available.  I've been very happy with the results of this camera.This is just fun and enjoyable camera. The 14x zoom lets you get close to your subjects, and the HD movie performance is fine for well lit situations.  When I researched this camera, I narrowed my choices to this camera an the S90.  I chose this camera because of the 14x zoom and the ability to shoot HD movies.  Faced with the choice again, I'd make the same one.  I highly recommend this camera.  But if you can live with less zoom, Canon just announced the S95.  It has a 3.8x zoom and a fast f/2.0 lens, a larger sensor with \"better\" resolution (10 mega-pixels), and better manual controls.  I'd check that out as well.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera in its class", "Author": "G. Allinson", "ReviewID": "R1YK367J2K8QJY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read many reviews and my choice came down to this camera, the Canon Powershot SX210 IS, and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7.  I've been a long time Canon fan. That did influence my choice and I bought the Canon.  Being familiar with the general control and menu system, manual layout, and computer software helps. I've had this camera for about 5 days and have taken more than 200 test and learning photos and about 25 additional photos.  What follows are some impressions.In my research, I've read many complaints about the flash design.  It is true that in some cases the lens housing will cast a shadow in the lower right hand corner of the photo when flash is used.  I've found that zooming in ever so slightly will eliminate that. The other flash complaint that others have is that it pops up and is in an inconvenient position.  I too find that the flash is often under my left index finger, but that can be a good thing as I can easily keep it down when I don't want it.  I have no trouble letting it up when I want to, either.  In fact, I routinely leave on the flash in the camera settings and then pop the flash up and down at will.  It is much easier and faster than turning it on and off in the settings.  If I'm in a place where flash is prohibited, keeping the flash down will positively keep me on the good side of the museum guards, etc.  I see the pop-up flash as a huge plus, as I can easily open and close it at will.  In my opinion, the flash is completely adequate for a compact camera.I find the Tv (shutter priority), Av (aperture priority) and M (manual modes) to be outstanding on this camera in ease of use and results.  I couldn't be more pleased with the ease of control and the associated image on the LCD.  I literally get what I see.The LCD is large and the information displayed is very welcome (easily turned off at the push of the button).  The combination scroll wheel and 4-way pad is awesome. For those that don't know it, a slight touch in any direction will display the 4-way controls on the LCD (they change depending on shooting mode and therefore can't be printed on the camera).  The LCD stands up to full, bright, California sun in situations where I'd have to resort to the viewfinder on my older point and shoot camera.  I don't know how they did it, but it works and can be brightened even more than normal by holding the \"display\" button down if needed.The quality and color  of the photos are great.  Depending on the shot there can be a disappointing amount of CA (a.k.a. chromatic aberration or purple fringing) in the corners in high contrast situations when examining a photo pixel for pixel (an extreme view to say the least).  Of course at normal viewing sizes it either can't be seen or is in the acceptable range for a camera of this class.  Frankly, that is an engineering trade-off in the lens design that I accept due to this camera packing 14x optical zoom and decent wide angle performance into such a small package.  I bought this camera for travel ease because I don't want to pack along my dSLR (theft, size and weight considerations).  I'm willing to make that trade-off and understand what and why it is.Did I mention this camera has a 14x optical zoom with image stabilization?  That's a huge plus for me.  This camera puts the \"super\" in \"superzoom\".  It also has decent wide angle performance.This camera handles ISO settings above 200 about as well as I've ever seen it handled in a compact camera. The Auto mode is perfectly acceptable for a quick snapshot, though I prefer to use the Program, Tv, Av, and manual modes.  I find that the Auto mode does tend to favor higher ISO settings than I would choose manually.  Like all cameras, even those with IS, taking a moment to frame and focus the shot, and holding as still as possible in the process still helps.  You still need to follow basic good practices to get good pictures.I've found the zoom lever not to be a problem.  I've quickly adjusted to it and use it with ease.  I still have trouble finding the power button without looking at it or thinking about it.  The good news is that I'm in no danger of turning it on or off accidentally.  The knurled mode dial on the back is great.  It is stiff enough to not move accidentally and loose enough to move when needed.I've only shot a few short video clips. They are acceptable for my purposes which are quick memories rather than great movies.  I like the 720p HD capability. I wish they hadn't bothered with the video cable, but then again, I still have the video cable from my old camera sealed in its original bag.The battery life is not stellar, but it recharges in a couple of hours.  Pick up a couple of inexpensive aftermarket batteries and you will be good to go. A nice 110 to 240 (only need the plug adapter for international travel) battery charger is included.There are a lot of fun, pre-programmed and artistic modes available, many of which I'll never use.  But for those of you who want them, you will not run out of fancy effects to keep you busy.Speaking of 14 MP, I don't buy into the MP hype.  Whether for reasons of speed in writing to the SD card or for saving storage space, the 9 MP mode works just fine.  I do wish that Canon had made this a 9 or 12 MP camera, but their marketing dept. seems to have overruled their engineers in this department.  Fortunately, I don't think the 14 MP really hurts the camera either.In closing, Canon has packed a lot into this compact, travel superzoom camera.  For its size, it does a solid job and I would recommend it.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Point and Shoot", "Author": "Lola Tinney", "ReviewID": "R1I90WDN81L76S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered two cameras, this one and the Panasonic ZS7 Lumix, because of the mixed reviews for this camera,.

Keener \"NK Mom\"", "ReviewID": "R1WFEGR9DV7IPP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a photo techy. I don't do aperture and focal length and all of that jargon. I'm a mom who wants good quality memories of my family. What I was looking for in a camera:* Works with my 4 GB Eye-Fi card (my 3 year-old one did not)* Could fit in a shirt pocket or purse* Good battery life* Good quality photos in the auto settings* Quality photos when zoomed in* Fast recovery time between shots (kids move so fast I was always missing shots)* Ability to zoom in and refocus when shooting videoThis camera delivers all of that and more. I learned about this camera from the Eye-Fi site of compatible cameras so waited until there were some reviews of it. I was greatly encouraged that so many photo buffs bought this camera as their point and shoot option when they didn't want to lug around their SLRs. They obviously are going to be more particular than I on the photo quality and the fact that so many found the quality close to the quality of their SLRs was good enough for me.Was a little concerned about the flash placement but turns out not to be an issue. The flash opens fine if you have to have your finger there and I have quickly learned to turn the camera on one-handed, which is easy to do because of its size. No problem with stabilizing the camera either. You can take crisp shots one-handed in normal photo taking circumstances, indoors and out.I've had it two weeks now and the battery is about 3/4. I've only taken about 30 shots so far but at least it doesn't drain just sitting around.I think the photo quality when zoomed is fabulous! I took one across the room and I can see the texture of the wall in it. I uploaded here a couple of shots at 14x zoom through a dirty window and they are gorgeous. One was while the wind spinner was in motion and it looks just like it was still when the photo was shot. Though I did change the setting for that one to continuous action on the Kids & Pets setting. Looks like that setting shuts off the 2 second review photo. In that mode I can take a shot again as soon as I can think of it so should be great with my kids, maybe 2 seconds between shots. I did take shots using the digital zoom (56x digital zoom) and those were blurry but that was with me holding the camera. Would probably work on a tripod.The video works great and I love that I can zoom in and pan and it refocuses automatically. My old camera didn't do that. If you wanted to zoom, you had to stop, zoom and then restart. This one also doesn't seem to pick up the sound of my breathing in the video which my old one often did. The whole HD thing isn't something I can speak to. I want to be able to shoot video clips. I play them back on my computer not my TV. They are for me and the grandparents.The smile detection seemed like fun and worked pretty well. Haven't tried the wink thing yet. I'm not getting any shadow like one reviewer said but honestly haven't been using the flash much. It takes great shots inside in lower light and when I have used the flash I'm finding I'm not getting that flash overexposure you often get. Photos just look properly lit.

The low light and natural light photos are great and I am very happy with my purchase.  I was concerned that you only get a basic printed manual and the rest is on a CD.  However, after reviewing the manual on my computer, there weren't any sections that I felt I needed to print out.  The on screen menus are easy to follow and the pop-up flash, while somewhat annoying, hasn't been a problem for me.  I do what another reviewer suggested and hold my finger over it when I turn on the camera.  It appears to be more fragile than my Fuji Finepix J10 and I find myself being extra careful and gentle with it.  But it may just seem so since it cost so much more.  I find myself wanting to go on vacation or to the zoo so I can take some really cool photos to compare with my other two cameras (the Fuji and a Panasonic DMC-FZ30).  All in all, I am very pleased.For those of you wanting a hard shell case to protect this camera, I finally found the right fit in the Case Logic SLDC-202 Compact Camera Case.

Well, if you take a close look, the images are not good. I can zoom in on my other camera images and get great detail. However, with this camera, zooming in, you find loss of detail due to hi ISO noise as well as JPEG artifacts. Since the max aperture is f/3.1, limited light causes AUTO mode to take shots with ISOs usually 160-400 range. The noise due to this is very visible compared to the clean 80-100 ISO range. On top of this, Canon decided that Fine mode is good enough and dropped SuperFine mode in favor of smaller size images. So there is additional JPEG artifact noise. (The DCT QT table is a lot more coarse especially on the chroma side, even at the DC level. This may explain the washed out & weird colors too.) I was looking forward to this camera based on specs, and waited 3 wks for it, but am extremely disappointed. 14 Mpx & $350, c'mon Canon! There is NO point in buying a 14 Mpx camera only to have the image quality ruined by ISO & JPEG noise.The LCD is not as bright as the SD790, and is effectively only 2.5\" for 4:3 images. I also take lots of panos and find it difficult to move the wheel all the way around and choose SCN setup to stitch assist mode. This is a simple step on my SD790. Canon does not even provide a printed Users Guide.So I just had to return this! It's bad unless you just don't take a close look.What I did like was the 14x zoom, widescreen HD movies & images to match, custom timer up to 10 shots, manual controls, and good images at 80-100 ISO.Oddly enough, I was nervous about the pop-up flash & weird zoom lever, but they did not bother me at all.", "Date": "April 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Overall good.", "Author": "Danno", "ReviewID": "R31M6WJTK5WZBR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm quite pleased with this purchase. The SX 210is is worth the pennies you put into it. Has pretty good AI for a point and shoot, fair low light pictures and amazing HD movies. I rarely use the flash since it degrades the true-to-life perception in photos, and it performs like a champ. In bright daylight the pictures are extremely crisp and full of color. In low lighting you do notice some noise since the ISO is ramped up to compensate. Using manual settings you can get crisp non-action shots even in low light. Rarely get blur when using the flash even with fast action shots.This camera takes amazing video. I've used it in the home, and out and about. The focus is a little slow if your moving from close to far objects but the detail is really worthy of being called 720p. It has tons of options for effects and manual control. Quite impressed with the technical abilities of the camera. Definitely has captured memories in detail that I haven't had with previous cameras.I have a Canon fs11 camcorder and the SX 210is takes better quality video in my opinion (fs11 is much faster from turn on to a record though).A few cons:Low light can produce noise and blur when taking pics. Videos are slightly grainy/noisy but nothing game breaking. Still great detail, its 14mp for crying out loud.The focus during videos is a little slow. The manual focus option can actually work faster if you know what you're doing.The Mic doesn't function well in a windy environment, but works great otherwise. Stereo sound isn't awesome unless things are to the far right or far left and then you can really hear it.The guy that posted about the dark shadow in the lower right is truth. But I've only personally found it when taking a macro picture with the flash. Taking a macro you're better off using natural light or background light anyway.For entry level or just needed a good P&S; this is a great camera. And for those comparing this to entry level DLSR's, there's no comparison. Apples and oranges. Just depends on your take of photography.

First, the true test of any camera is how well it photographs oil paintings.  This camera is suburb.  My wife is an artist and photographing her paintings is always a challenge.  I followed a tip on the internet and chose Scene -- autumn leaves.  This pumps up the color slightly and makes the photos close to the original.  We compared the photos with the original paintings and they were mighty accurate in color reproduction.  The photos are much better than what my wife obtained using professional photographers in the past.Second, the camera does well with photos partly in the shade and partly in the sun.  I would say that results are very near that obtained with film SLR cameras.  Most digital camera freak out under such circumstances.Third, the camera performs extremely well under low level light conditions.For the size,features and performance, this camera can't be beat.I bought spare genuine Canon batteries and I get about 230 photos per charge, which is more than adequate.", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Why so Slow?", "Author": "S.

I thought, YES! this is exactly what I was looking for. I own 3 Canon cameras and have been a loyal customer for years. Much to my dismay, this camera is disappointing. I should have waited and checked the camera out in the store - hands on. My biggest diappointment is the slow processing time. I have 2 year old twins that I wanted to take close-ups of without always being in their face. I have to wait a total of 4 seconds between each shot before the camera is free to take another. Way too long with children or animals or anything that moves. The Canon tech support suggested I turn off the review, but how would I know if I got the picture I wanted? so that was not a good option for me. The zoom button in my opinion is hard to maneuver. My finger gets sore pressing that tiny, sharp lever. I would not recommend this camera to people who have any kind of arthritis. The zoom is slow, which I would not mind if it wasn't also hard to press. In all fairness, you can get some superb shots with this camera. I took some close-ups in a parade and was happy with most of the pictures. Probably lost some good photo opportunities because of the slow processing time. As hard as it would have been for me, I would have forgone my loyalty to Canon and gone with another name brand like Nikon, but I don't see anything like this out there YET. The bigger zoom cameras are bigger and don't really slip into your purse. I just wish I knew why this camera is so slow in processing? Such a step backwards for such a great company.

Both are minor issues.I own a Nikon D90 and D300, but I also travel with a small PowerShot as my \"pocket camera.\"  My first was a SD900, followed by an SD990IS (which was a slight improvement). Yet I was never really happy with the image quality of either, and the video was a greater disappointment.I was about to buy a top-rated S90, in spite of its age in digital camera terms. Yet I opted to pre-order the SX210IS, as newer is generally better.Both the 14.1 MP 14X Zoom are a bit over the top - I'd prefer a wider angle and not so much zoom! Yet no regrets - image quality, color saturation and HD video quality are noticeably better than the SD ELPH series (some costing more than the SX210IS).I just bought two 32 GB SD cards and can't wait to shoot lots of street photos and some video on an upcoming trip to Barcelona. This camera is perfect in places where expensive DSLR or HD camcorder equipment would attract the attention of petty thieves.I did have one instance while photographing kids, where the camera simply would not auto-focus. Yet that may have been new-user error, as I had my D90 in the other hand. No problems since.When a new HD model of the S90 is released, I'll likely give away my SX210IS, as I did with my previous PowerShots.

Easy to use, has TONS of features and manual settings for the guys that like to take more control, and the pictures are outstanding. The quality of pictures I am getting over my a720is is incredible. I am getting a much sharper, clearer, and more colorful picture and I thought what I was seeing before was nice with that a720...This camera has a plethora of fun settings, smile detection, wink detection, blink detection, redeye removal and prevention, an amazing zoom length (14x OPTICAL!)and it's no slouch on the macros either. I also love that this camera not only tells you what setting you have chosen on screen, but it also explains WHAT THE FEATURE DOES FOR YOU! My wife, who knows ZIP about photography, is now taking better pictures than ever before and is beginning to understand what changing the settings will do for her. Very nice touch by Canon...I researched the daylights out of this camera and I couldn't find a negative professional review. I read a LOT of them too. If your budget is around three hundred dollars look no further.Oh, someone else here wrote a review and commented that the camera zooms very slowly. This is NOT true. Had he read the manual he would have discovered that pushing the zoom button a little harder makes the speed increase. You can almost snap zoom in on a subject if you want to. I LOVE how Canon designed the zoom because you can crawl or run while zooming in...it's your call.EDIT:I just got home after using this gem to shoot my daughters softball game. Let me tell you, it's so nice to sit in the stands and get a close up of her on second base! The 14x zoom is still surprising me! Last year when shooting pictures using my a720is I always had to get as close as possible to get a decent shot and that camera has a 6x optical zoom. The day was cold and cloudy yet every picture and video I shot looked fantastic.The video is what prompted me to edit this review a little. I set it to record in HD and shot her at bat and while running the bases. You can still zoom in and out while shooting video which is another plus I discovered by the way. When I got home I was amazed at the quality of the video it took! It even looks better than what my full blown, mid range Sony handy cam produces! I can't believe I am getting video this clear, colorful, and sharp from a pocket sized camera. I installed an 8 gig, class 6 HC SD card in the camera and still had a TON of room left. Granted I didn't shoot a lot of video that day but I know I can fit a decent amount on there if needed. You can also step down the quality to also not take up so much space.Anyway, just buy this camera. It packs a punch in every category and is easy to use.Oh, the 8g HC SD class 6 card I bought was from Transcend. It has worked flawlessly and is very, very fast.

I ordered the SX210IS because of the HD.  The primary features are the same as the SD800 but better.  The only \"downside\" of this camera that I have found so far are the following:  They all have white print on the buttons.  The white print on the gold body does not show up well.  The camera body comes in gold, black and purple.  In fact, in bright light its even worse because the metal is a little shiny.  The contrast between the white print against the gold colored body is difficult to see.  I showed the camera to five of my friends and they agreed with me.  The flash is located in an awkward place.  The area where the flash pops up is where I naturally hold the camera so the flash usually doesn't pop up because my finger is holding it down.  With my old camera this was not a problem because the flash was built in; not pop up.  With this new camera I have to remember to hold my left hand in the shape of an \"L\" and let the camera rest in the corner of my \"L\".  My right hand can hold the camera as normal without obstructing anything.  With the red eye \"on\", there is a significant delay.  If using red eye feature, be sure it's when your subjects are posing and not moving as they will surely have a long wait for you to take their photo.  Regarding the video feature: The HD quality is noticible compared to my old camera.  Sound is better too.  Be aware that in order to view HD video on a computer, the computer needs a minimum requirement for viewing capability, so read the online user guide first to see if your computer matches.  Regarding the delivery of the product:  It arrived on time.  I had ordered a HD SD card on the same day.  The SD card was cancelled by the seller due to lack of inventory, so I had to go online and order a different one.  As soon as the SD card arrived, I popped it in the camera and finally \"played\" with it.  At that time I realized the white print on the gold camera was terrible.  But by this time, with the delay of the SD card, I was outside of the window of time that the seller accepts returns.  I called Amazon and also called the seller and explained what happened.  I have since sent the gold color back and reordered the purple one.  I still have the problem with the location of the flash, and red eye, but at least I can see the camera settings!!  The return of the gold color camera was easy and went without any problems.  I'm currently using the purple one.

My tests of the Canon SX210 and Nikon S8100 show that the low light photos from the SX210 are very good but the Nikon has the edge when it comes to low noise at high ISO.  However, if you also want great low light video, the SX210 is in a class by itself and the Nikon simply can't compete.  Credit Canon's long history building camcorders --the SX210 even outperforms the HD video quality of the $350 Canon R10 camcorder I recently tested (and returned).  In my two weeks of evaluation, I've determined that the Canon SX210 is the optimum choice if you want the best balance of low light photos and good video.Here are my observations after two weeks of testing:CANON SX210 PROS-Very good low light video, video brightness control really boosts low light sensitivity.-Very good still photos, camera chooses higher ISO settings to reduce motion blur-Camera displays its ISO choice when you pre-focus (not possible with Nikon)-Extensive customization settings for every shooting mode (versus limited Nikon settings).-Widescreen LCD for full frame video display-Very good build quality-Pop up flash automatically raises or lowers when you power on/offCANON SX210 CONS-Body design makes for tricky handling (pop up flash, no rear thumb grip, smooth surfaces)-LCD is only 230K pixel (compared to the incredible Nikon 921K pixel display)-Still photo review area is much smaller on widescreen display-Overall still image quality has more noise and less sharpness compared to the Nikon-Some flash shadow at the 28mm wide angle setting (disappears from 30mm on up)NIKON S8100 PROS-Nice build quality and easy-to-handle design.  Feels like a pro-sumer $600 camera.-Outrageous 3-inch, 921K pixel LCD display --amazing clarity and detail.-Decent HD video in daytime lighting.-Powerful flash that provides excellent illumination at all zoom settings (no flash shadow at wide angle).-USB battery charging in camera (can connect to your PC to charge).NIKON S8100 CONS-No manual control except for +/-exposure compensation.-No brightness or white balance settings for video (versus Canon's excellent custom controls).-Auto white balance is fooled by compact fluorescent lights (Canon's AWB is more reliable).-Camera prefers low ISO settings even in low light and this can cause motion blur.-Significant zoom motor noise during videos (versus the nearly silent Canon SX210 zoom)-Video focusing is often slow to lock (but still photo focus is fast)-Pop-up flash must be pushed back into camera body before stowing camera in case.-Camera beep and shutter release sound can only be turned on or off (no volume adjustment like Canon)STILL PHOTO QUALITY COMPARISON:Photos in good lighting are comparable between the Nikon and Canon.  The Nikon has the least noise at higher ISO settings.  In low light, the Nikon really shines and if you take photos of non-moving subjects, the S8100 is your best choice.  However, the Nikon chooses very low ISO settings (and therefore low shutter speeds) to achieve this great performance --not good if your subjects are moving (you'll get blur).  At high zoom, both cameras have to use lower shutter speeds and every super zoom camera suffers from this issue --it's the problem most people complain about when they try out their new cameras.  The only way to solve this problem is to either use the flash or set high ISO (something the Canon does automatically) in order to force the camera to select a higher shutter speed.  There is no other solution and no camera has yet been developed to solve this problem -it's a compromise of light, optics, and sensor sensitivity in compact camera bodies.  For all around shooting, the Canon is more reliable since it chooses higher ISO (and hence faster shutter speeds) to capture non-blurry images.  Both cameras do well when the flash is used but the Nikon's flash works better at telephoto settings.HD VIDEO QUALITY:Both cameras have good HD video and excellent image stabilization in good lighting.  As with most super zoom compacts, focus lock in low light is a challenge but the Canon SX210 is better than the Nikon if you want faster focus lock during video.  The Canon operates more like a dedicated camcorder; the Nikon operates as if video was a second thought feature.  The Canon's low light video brightness, focus speed, and silent zoom motor make for great video under all conditions.  Unfortunately, the Nikon's noisy zoom motor is recorded in videos and the camera simply can't provide bright, usable videos in low indoor lighting.  In low light, the Canon is in a league of its own.  If you're trying to video children or pets running back and forth quickly at close range to these cameras then you'll be disappointed in ANY super zoom compact camera you try.  The fact is the ultimate, magic \"focus anywhere instantly\" machine has not yet been invented.  However, as an alternative to lugging around a dedicated HD camcorder, the Canon SX210 is hard to beat for convenience and consistent HD video quality.OVERALL:I really, really wanted to keep the Nikon S8100.  It has superb handling quality, great low light still photos and an impressive 921K pixel display.  I have owned several Canon and Fuji digital cameras and have never seriously considered Nikon's point-and-shoot offerings until the introduction of the S8100.  However, the Nikon is not a well-rounded still/video camera.  It does a few things very well but fails at others.  The Canon SX210, on the other hand, is a much better performer at each end of the still photo and video spectrum.  The Nikon is great camera to hold and operate from a hardware standpoint, but the Canon simply out performs it when it comes to getting the best quality photos and videos under a wide range of shooting conditions.  After months of research and camera testing, I believe the Canon SX210 provides the best balance of performance among its peers if you're in the market for a pocketable camera that can deliver very good photos and high-quality videos.SPECIAL NOTE ON POP-UP FLASHA lot of people complain about the pop-up flash on super-zoom cameras since the flash is usually located on the top left corner of the camera body and occupies the space where you want to hold the camera. Be advised that the pop-up flash is a physical necessity in order to move the flash far enough away from the camera so that the long, super-zoom lens doesn't cast a shadow on your subject when the flash fires. If you really don't like the inconvenience of the pop-up flash then your only choice is a limited (7X or less) zoom camera or a bulkier SLR-type. If you want a pocketable super-zoom, you'll just have to get used to this flash placement. It may be a minor inconvenience at first, but in the end it's a non-issue and should not be the sole reason you give up on the incredible performance that compact, 14X zoom cameras like the SX210 have to offer.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best of the 2010 compact megazooms", "Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "R1OK3TVLYBZYFZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The roster of new compact megazooms for spring 2010 is very impressive with all the major manufacturers coming out with hot new cameras. I waited to read the reviews from the earliest adopters (thanks all of you) before picking this Canon. The raw statistics were themselves impressive. The 14x zoom and 14 MP live up to the hype. I was super-impressed with how well I could \"pull in\" subjects across the field.But the other features of the camera make it a tremendous little package. And it is indeed little. It fit comfortably in a cargo pant side pocket. Light and small.The dedicated video button is a great idea and made me more likely to shift to video than I would have been  without it. Also, I love the old style mode dial. Much more convenient and easy to use than a menu driven system. That being said, the menus and the navigation dial are very well put together and easy to navigate. A very bright, big and clear LCD screen.I love having manual focus, Aperture, Shutter, and Program settings like on an old camera, and I was thrilled to see that the changes in settings showed up on the LCD to simulate what the shot would look like. Super cool for an amateur photographer and will help me take better pictures in the future.The shutter speed is fast but still not SLR fast. The lag between shots is less than my previous camera but still not perfect. I like that you can shift back to the shooting screen before the previous image is finished writing to disk.Strong low light performance. I was surprised at how well it did in pub lit mainly by Christmas lights. I got clear, balanced shots when every other camera at the table was producing nothing worth keeping.I have not had much luck with the continuous shooting modes yet. I'll need to do some homework to understand why those are not working for me. Also, I have not had success with shooting fast moving objects. The kids and pets mode was not fast enough for the zoo and I could not \"outsmart\" it with any of the manual settings. Finally, battery life is a point of concern. On my first long day of shooting, the battery signaled it was getting low before evening. I have ordered a backup battery to be sure that I won't run out of juice on a whole day away from home. I would have expected the battery to last a whole day no problem.Overall, I couldn't be happier.

It is worth sharing that there is only one competitor in this class which have RAW mode, CASIO FH100.2) Auto bracketing (I am not sure if any competitor provides this feature)Overall this is best camera in travel zoom class.Does not matter what star rating you see for this camera in reviews just go to store and try all the cameras and try to shoot other than Auto mode(I am sure you know competitors SONY H5V, Casio FH100, Panasonic ZS7, Samsung HZ35W).You will agree with me that when it comes to camera no one can beat CANON.As a final note if Zoom is not a concern try Canon S90 or S95(upgrade to S90).", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera with 1 surprise", "Author": "Profweb \"profwebbob\"", "ReviewID": "R3CYEHRVZ21UTI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll leave the technical reviews to others.  I bought the SX210 primarily for the 14x zoom and it has let me get some fantastic photos.  I was even at one event where a guy with a digital SLR who had been sitting behind me came up to me at the end and asked me about the SX210 because he had seen (over my shoulder) the shots I was getting with the zoom and was impressed.I did have one surprise though.  Apparently the LCD display is polarized.  I found this out the first time I tried to take a vertically oriented picture while wearing sunglasses and all of a sudden the LCD went totally black on me.

Most of the interior photos are crisp and the wide angle setting works well in large unlit rooms. These cameras eat batteries quickly so I recommend an extra battery and car charger.

I've read some negative reviews about it so I was prepared for a disappointment. But I'm glad to say it works great for me. The pictures were mostly taken in bright sunny conditions and the bright scenes were a little washed out but iPhoto on my Mac lets me tweak them so they come out great. Nothing will help out of focus pictures though. I knew which ones I goofed on so it was no surprise when they came out blurry. I never used a tripod on any shots and as lightweight as this camera is you won't need a very big one to hold it anyway.  I took all of the pictures on AUTO or Macro to start off and I will use all of the manual adjustments later. I was in such a hurry to see how they would come out I didn't read up on advanced settings yet. I still own a Canon G9 which takes beautiful pictures that can look outstanding with iPhoto in my Mac. It seems to have plenty of scene choices that can be accessed easily enough to experiment. The auto focus did hunt some in darker conditions in the swampy area I was photographing in. But I still got some great shots and used photo lock to focus on a near object then moved to the object I wanted. I will mostly be taking outdoor photos so auto focus in dark conditions won't be a problem for me. The zoom worked great too taking some full optical zoom pictures of wildlife that look great. I only used the video a couple of times so that's a work in progress keeping it steady,the auto focus worked good while filming and I zoomed in with no problem also. I only use video for a few minutes at a time so it's not that big a deal. This isn't a camcorder too! Just a little extra to use every so often. I took 102 photos and a couple minutes of video in about 2 hours in the park. I didn't check the battery afterwards, I just put it on to recharge when I got home. I can't really say how long the battery will last but I'm not a professional who'll be out all day shooting photos so I'm happy. I will say the small controls on the back are not made for people with large hands. I found it easier to use them the more pictures I took and made adjustments. The menus and the wheel to navigate them is pretty cool to. Just download the manual on your computer and read up on the things you want to try. Don't try to do everything in one day. Put it on auto and see how you do then move on . This camera easily fits in your pocket or a small holster. I just left the flash down until I needed it and that way it never got in my way when I was holding the camera. This was the biggest complaint by most people but you just open it manually for an easy solution to me.

Now there are many good cameras of this type to choose. I narrowed my choices to the Canon SX210 IS, the Samsung HZ35W and the Panasonic DMC-ZS7. I am fortunate to have a great camera store in my neighborhood. They are fortunate to have me for a customer, since I have have spent the price of a nice car there in the past 25 years. That's why the let me have three cameras to try over a weekend. I just went out with them and shot about 100 photos with each.It was easy to rule out the Canon, because it was just annoying to use. The zoom lever is tiny, there is no grip, no place for your thumb, the flash pops up whether needed or not, etc. - this may not bother you, but it was too much for me. If the Canon's image quality were significantly better than the other two, I might put up with the annoyance. Though the Canon's image quality was certainly very good, the Samsung and Panasonic photos were actually better when examined at 100%.It was a more difficult choice between the Samsung and Panasonic. I judged the Samsung's image quality to be better for my taste. The Samsung has a truly superior AMOLED screen, the best I have seen on a P&S; camera. Comparing the ZS7's output to my old ZS3's, I saw little improvement. I had hoped for better, but it was close enough to the Samsung for me. The Panasonic also just felt right in my hand, since the body is the same as the ZS3 that I had used for a couple of years. In the end, I finally made the decision based on GPS performance, where the Panasonic is just in a different class. Google \"site:[...] samsung hz35w gps\" if you want to see what I mean. If you don't care about the GPS feature, I recommend that you give the Samsung HZ30W a try.  It appears to be identical to the HZ35W except for having a conventional LCD screen, no GPS and lower price. This was the camera I had originally wanted to try, but none was available at the time.", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not happy Canon", "Author": "MiaDavo", "ReviewID": "R2O7V1GDK93DS9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I never usually write reviews, but this camera has annoyed me so much that I wanted to share, and to also get it off my chest. I have owned many cameras in my past, including a Canon DSLR (400d) but wanted something compact, with a bit of zoom that I could take out and about without lugging around my entire kit. I am not looking to take superior art like pictures, but just to capture moments with my family and friends with ease.First of all, this camera has been designed so ergonomically wrong that it makes me cringe. The flash pops up right where you will hold it with your left index finger, which has resulted in me missing spare of the moment shots which I can now never get back. Also, holding it vertically can make your fingers slip, and completely change it from ready to take to previewing old pictures, which, many times now, has resulted in me missing important shots (including my best friend walking down the aisle at her wedding). I am a female with small hands too.My biggest disappointment with this camera is its lack of focus and image quality. I will admit that yes, this camera can take a great picture, in absolutely ideal conditions, where you have all the time in the world to get the perfect shot, but how often are we presented with that situation? And no matter how many times I give it the another chance, my photos are always tarnished and I curse myself for taking this out.After months of giving this camera chance after chance, taking it and testing in many different situations, I have sadly come to the conclusion that it just cannot perform to an acceptable standard. I have now purchased the Canon G11 (after doing extensive research this time) and I must say that this camera is absolutely incredible! This is what I have been looking for. Yes, it is lacking the zoom that the SX210 has, but what would you prefer, a camera that can zoom but can't guarantee to perform when needed, or a camera that can perform in most situations it is faced with absolute ease?", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera, a few issues", "Author": "Thomas F. Coulton", "ReviewID": "R3GN44LVXYKP39", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera over the weekend wanting some time to play with it before heading to Vegas. I took the camera out for a trial run at a Wisconsin State Park and was very happy with how the pictures came out, and I left the camera in AUTO mode the whole time.I have played around with some of the other settings and really did not find those to be a make or break for me wanting this camera much less see myself using to many of them.What was the make or break for me was the not only the image quality, but also the video. It does shoot 720p HD video and it does look good on my laptop. I really wish companies would get rid of the .mov format for video, makes it really hard to just use the basic movie maker in Windows, now I have to buy another program to do a conversion if I want to edit it at all. But you can upload to YouTube as is no problem.The ones thing that really has me bummed about the video that I did not hear in the video I shot at the local Best Buy, was the motor and zoom button noise that the mic pics up.In the store the music is so loud that it drowns out the motor sound and the click sound from pushing the zoom button. As for the click sound, with enough practice you can learn to hold the camera where you will not make that sound, but you can hear the motor sound. It is not loud, but you can hear it.The camera does take a little time to get use to holding. I did find myself many time putting my finger in front of the flash, but after a while I was able to find a comfortable place for my left hand.Here are some shots I took with the camera, the first 3 shots I wanted to see how close across the lake I could get zooming in. The first shot is no zoom, the next is the 14x normal zoom and the 3rd is maxed out at 56x digital zoom.Pictures 4 and 5 are the same, picture 4 is maxed out and picture 5 is no zoom.[...].Pros:Pictures look good in AUTOVideo quality is goodLightEasy to useGreat battery life.Cons:Some bad design featuresMotor sound in video when zoomingHard to hold with left hand", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera", "Author": "Surfer mom", "ReviewID": "R3KNVB7OO0YFNZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched camera reviews for about 4 months before deciding on theCanon SX210 IS.

The images are beyond compare.  I connected the camera to my 32\" Panasonic Viera HD TV with an HDMI cable and stills look like you are there.  Color and sharpness is outstanding.There are a few tricks I learned to getting good results from the camera:1) You must make sure you are focusing on the right thing.  If you are shooting a photo of a person standing in front of the Grand Canyon, make sure the auto-focus focuses on the person's face and not a rock that's 5 miles away.  You do this by centering the person in your picture and pushing the shutter button half way down.  You will see the little focus target box in the viewfinder on your subjects face.  Then compose the shot the way you want it to look.2) Flash is amazingly good for a little camera, at least compared to the other 4 digital camera's I've owned.  I always use the flash for fill when taking pictures of people outdoors, and find the pop-up flash very useful.  Here's why:  I have the camera set for \"always use flash,\" but the flash is disabled when you close the pop up flash.  Now I don't have to navigate through menu's to turn the flash on and off.  This is especially useful if you're looking for a dramatic effect by using existing light in dim or night time conditions.3) Pick up a few cheapie off-brand batteries here on Amazon.  They're like $2 each, which is a lot better than Canon's battery price.  Shooting video eats batteries a lot faster than shooting stills.4) I got some fantastic night time pictures by setting the camera onto manual, opening the lens to its widest f-stop and selecting the shutter speed as I watched the image brighten in the LCD screen.  What you see is what you get, but if your shutter speed is under 1/30th of a second, you're going to need a tripod, or at least a flat surface to steady the camera.  I got a 5 second exposure by holding the camera firmly on a fence post, and it looks darned good for a point and shoot.5) If your computer has an SD slot, you can transfer the images directly from the card to the PC without loading all of the Canon software.  That's my preference.I was a little disappointed by the video, but I think it's because I failed to set the camera properly.  Video generally looks crisp on the camera's LCD screen, but when played back on my HDTV, it's soft.  There's quite a few more settings than just selecting \"best quality,\" and I didn't read the manual, so my bad.  The video's not horrible, just not up to the quality of some of the samples I've seen from other users in their on-line reviews.On my trip, four other people on our tour bus saw me shooting video with my point and shoot, and by the end of the day, they were all shooting video.  Most of them didn't even realize their cameras could do it.", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lens Shadow FTL", "Author": "J.

with this camera.  Hopefully, it can potentially help you save up to $60 in restocking fees and return shipping costs should you find the cons I address here to be just as unacceptable as I did.Pros:Decent picture. Lots of neat features. Unfortunately, there are a few major cons that give me no choice but to be overly harsh on the SX210.Cons:I've since purchased and returned two SX210s, both of which were notorious for dumping shadowy blackness in the lower right corner of my photos. This phenomenon is caused by the camera's lens barrel which blocks the flash, causing it to cast a shadow in your photo.To be fair, the shadow doesn't show when you're in wide open spaces or not using a flash. If you're shooting indoors, be wary of objects to your immediate right when using a flash or you'll almost certainly see the shadow in your photo. The shadow CAN AND DOES APPEAR at standard, non-macro range (see video).About the high def video: It's only high def by virtue of the fact that it has the appropriate number of pixels. It certainly doesn't produce true high def quality as it is grainy and lacking in clarity. I'm fully aware that it's a camera and not a camcorder. I'm just trying to help others avoid the same misconception I had when I saw \"high def video\" since, to me, high def means high def.Summary:I initially chose the SX210 because I simply wanted an all-around good camera. It was a major disappointment to me when I realized that I had to be conscious of where I was standing prior to shooting. Having to retake a photo because I happened to be too close to a wall was largely irritating, especially since this is a point-and-shoot, not a professional-grade SLR.If you're primarily going to be shooting outdoors, the lens shadow won't be an issue. After all, the SX210 has a 14x optical zoom, so I can only assume that the majority of its users are going to be outdoors photographing birds and other various wildlife.I wish Canon implemented smarter design with the SX210 rather than resorting to the numbers game. 14 megapixels wich such a small image sensor?  Boasting high def video when it doesn't produce true high def quality?  14x optical zoom with a lens barrel so big it that blocks the flash?Canon, what were you thinking?", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Class 4 flash card (or faster) is needed.", "Author": "sqeeky", "ReviewID": "R1TGX718R1EGAM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although I could not find this specified in any of the manufacturers information on line, I didsee in the accompanying documentation that Canon recommends the user buy a flash card that is atleast 15mb/s.

As a die hard Nikon fan I was hesitant to purchase this Canon. But the 15x zoom, 14 mp and small size put me over the edge and I'm glad I made the switch. It's not as great as the DSLR's or the full feature digitals but it's excellent for everyday use and quick, high quality photos. This little Canon also seems to be designed much better then simlar cameras from Nikon, Sony and Samsung. Pros - size, zoom, ease of use, design, photo quality and cost when compared to other camras with the same features.

It doesn't take photos in RAW, which isn't a big deal to me. The image stabilization doesn't come even close to as smooth as the stabilization of my Rebel T2I with either the 18-55mm kit lens or the Tamron 18-270mm VC lens in video or still shots, but to compare the 2 is unfair for the compact camera. For what it is and does it's the next best thing when I can't carry a DSLR. Shot to shot speed is on mine quite impressive for a compact, again to compare it to a DSLR is slow, but unfair. Truth is it's used more often than my DSLR cameras because it's so much easier and convienient{SP} to tag along when I'm on the go. The quality of the images is impressive when the proper mode is used and or used in Manual mode, A Pri or S Priority. Video is quite good, but will definitely require tripod at the long end of it's impressive 14x optical zoom. I never use digital zoom on any camera because of both my shaky hands and image degradation, therefore I can't fairly comment on that. Others complain about the pop up flash which activates in all modes, but it's so easy to either hold it down or push it down that it's a non issue.

The in camera editing/art features are fantastic and are fun to play with. The menu was a little different than the ones I've used before, but if you've ever used a Canon you'll get the hang of it. My only complaint is it takes a second to wake up, for example the flash has to charge. I'm not a heavy flash user so it's not a big deal.

I just liked the larger optical zoom lens. WOW.  What a surprise.  This is one amazing camera.

I can not believe the quality of the pictures and the ease of use.  I haven't picked up my big camera since.  I do recommend going to a LOCAL camera shop because they are really there to serve you and have the knowledge and expertise to help you pick out what is best for your needs.  The best Buys and similar stores are just unable to provide the expertise needed.

King \"Sea King\"", "ReviewID": "R2KNB16AQR2GXQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been buying Canon cameras since their first digital fell on the market. I love them, I admit it. I've tried others, they don't compare. That being said, they have never been amazing in low light and they waited their sweet time to put out a pocket sized camera with a usable zoom. I've been holding off buying one for 3 years just so Canon could get their poo together. I was getting mad, how could Sony, Olympia, etc. have streamlined, pocket-sized, 5X zoom, OK in lowlight, easy to use, market ready cameras years ago and Canon - who, with Nikon, is really the only camera maker worth paying for - be so far behind? Now I understand. They waited because, as Woody says in Toy Story, they weren't aiming for the truck. This camera blows every other camera I have ever had out of the water. Not only did they laugh at 5X zoom and give us 14X OPTICAL with 14 MP, which is unheard of, but it's almost impossible to take a bad picture. I'm still messing with the options and figuring out how to use some of the settings, but honestly, putting it on Auto or Portrait and just 'pointing and shooting' got me some amazing shots, even at night - phenomenal shots. THIS CAMERA IS EASY TO USE! The only thing I had trouble with is taking pictures of a drummer on stage, which, if you have ever tried to photograph concerts, you know is pretty much an impossible task in general - crazy low light, distance and lots of movement. There's a little bit of noise in low light shots, but the color is wonderful and the ease of use is unbeatable. I'm even in love with the flash as it doesn't drown out the color or background like most do if it's just too dark and you need to use it.I have 2 complaints, and they're legitimate ones.1: Battery. There's no way to turn off the display to save it, the life is pretty short, and the batteries are expensive. But that being said, for every day use, get 1 extra and you're probably fine. I took mine on vacation, charged one at night and used the other during the day. Battery life is about 2-3 hours straight use, but if you turn it on and off for a few shots throughout the day, you're fine. I have 3 in total, just in case.2: Flash pops up automatically when you press the power button and it's right where you comfortably hold the camera for use. I have a feeling I will be wrecking that motor. Seems like an oversight to me, but as you can manually close and open the flash, hopefully I'm not killing it every time I accidentally hold it down - I guess that's TBD.FYI standard underwater houses do not work for this camera because of the lens length (even without hitting the zoom), and night shots get trickier when the battery life is low.The video is not true HD (its 720p) but as I bought it for photos, not HD recording, I look at 720p as icing on the cake, and the sound quality is not bad at all - I filmed a song in a rather loud concert hall, and it came out pretty well - plus you can zoom during recording, which is great (you'd that that would be an obvious thing, but not all cameras let you).Almost no red eye issues thanks to the pop up flash - in fact, my blue eyes looked rather dynamic in almost every shot, and the flash is perfect for standardizing pictures with too much background light. AND, the thing is pretty sturdy. Hate to say it, but it's been dropped, yet doesn't even have a scratch.This camera is so wonderful, I'm thinking of selling my Canon PowerShot SX1IS.Now buy it already!", "Date": "February 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "for $199, can't beat this!

I found this difficult for two reasons. The first reason is that the level of detail on the screen is just not as good as the image through the lens. The second reason has to do with factors such as glare, brightness and contrast, and a slight amount of far sightedness making it somewhat difficult to adjust focus from a distant object to the screened image. However, I found that with a little patience and practice the images shot with the new Cannon SX210IS came out well centered and the autofocus did a credible job of obtaining details. This is no doubt due to the great combination of the zoom and the 14.1 MP images. The patience and practice came in handy during my grandson's soccer games, trips to playgounds when photos of both grandkids were taken and during the Thanksgiving holidays when friends and family dropped by. One slightly negative note regarding the flash capacity at ten or more feet should not be considered a deterrent to purchase of this camera; but, should be a factor to consider when preparing to take a shot. I know from research and reading that there are ways to overcome some of the lighting issues with settings internal to the camera. However, I have not taken the time to reset them and experiment with them yet.This camera was also used to take video shots of a few moments duration and the imaging was very nice and stutter free. The microphone is a little on the tinny sounding side in my opinion and not quite as good as a purpose built video camera. However, for a small format camera that easily fits in your shirt pocket it is much less cumbersome and less intrusive as was noted during my granddaughter's Thanksgiving recital.In addition to the camera, I procured a very nice 16 GB class 10 sdhc memory card good for hours of video or hundreds of photos. I highly recommend this size card and the class 10 speed to make the most of the camera's capabilities. I also purchased an extra canon OEM battery which I have not even needed to use as the battery life of this camera has been very nice.I have had photos processed at local photo kiosks on up to 8 by 10 sizes and used similar and smaller sized printed photos on our home printer and been very happy with the output.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot SX210IS", "Author": "jlg", "ReviewID": "R2BTE2NA73AJUO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to use, however, one's left hand can very easily be in the way of the flash as it will automatically rise when the camera is turned on.

The automatic settings--auto, night, indoors--all seemed to over-expose the shots--which was worrying, but I switched to manual (the controls were fairly intuitive, so I didn't have to keep referring to the manual), and could take shots without a tripod. As long as I can get shots fairly easily, I don't mind.  But for those wishing for better auto shots in low light, I guess they are correct in complaining, or at least noting the problems.My expectations aren't high... I just needed a new camera to replace one I've had for five or six years--so just about anything new would be better for me!  I wanted this one because I hadn't tried a Canon before and everyone was always raving about them (I'd had Olympuses), and I liked the super-zoom in a small point and shoot.  The size and weight is convenient.  The color is cute, too.

After many researches and testing of 2 other camcorder in $300 price range(Sanyo VPC-FH1A, Panasonic SDR-H100) I've decided to get a travel zoom type camera with good photo and video quality. And as long as photo is descent, I was mainly interested in better video quality.SX210+Pro+longer zoom+Bright Viewable video in low light with only 2candle on a table.+Excellent user control and menu and spinning control switch, I loved the menu and control.+I would say about 20% longer battery life than the panasonic with its GPS off.+Manual focus option+Better flash light exposure/light handling+No motor noise during zooming in video.-Con-Soft/fuzzy lens. Not sure if unit I got was defective or all of them are alike, it is 1of2 main reason for not keeping Canon. General users won't realize this unless you do a side by side comparison with a sharper image.-High noise video. Even in bright indoor lighting condition. The 2nd main reason for not keeping Canon-The weird...or lack of ergonomic design, which one can get used to with practice. Hard to operate with one hand.-Sound recording is lacking, when replayed on my pc, sound felt distend and tinny.-Highlights pink/magenta color.-Its got great flash exposure, produces nice looks flash photos, but in auto mode, it would lean to use longer exposure/higher ISO over flash...no idea why...ZS7+Pro+Beautiful video, the video is over processed, but video looks great.+Sharp lens, takes sharp photos and videos+Wider angle, and the i-zoom is very usable.+Great sound recording quality, what you hear is almost what you record.+Ergonomically friendly to handle with one or both hands.+When in full auto modeCon-Image is over processed...I really don't like it...look too unnatural to me, Even customization to tune everything down in setup does not help much. However, most general users will find the image beautiful, but that's because some of the details are gone, and colors are adjusted. A image taken of my wife with ZS7 will show her with smooth skin with light makeup, but when taken with SX210, you'll see the reality of wrinkles and no makeup. However same would apply if you want to take image to show detail...there will be no detail of fine scratches/fine dusts/fine particles...-Video taken with 2 candles, and background music in the room to emulate cake cutting, was very dark. However, if you can adjust the brightness and contrast on the player you use, you'll still be able to see most things that was captured by Canon. So the data is still captured...just too dark to be viewable.....wish this was adjustable in camera.-The menu control is not as innovative and easy to navigate as the Canon, is not bad, but can really see some improvement.-In auto mode, it leans towards using flashes....which does not offer as good as exposure when compared to Canon.In the end I kept the Panasonic and returned the Canon. It was a hard decision for me until I realized the fuzzy image Canon was producing, because I simply can't stand a fuzzy video or image. My wife is happy with the wrinkle removing feature...and I will revert to my DSLR if I wanted to take photos of greater detail. You will not notices the fuzzy images unless you pixel peep at 100%, it really doesn't matter to most users who print at 4x5.

It was time for a serious upgrade (camera, not husband)and I didn't want to make a serious mistake as this is for the long haul (camera and husband).  I have used a Canon Powershot point and shoot for several years, in fact, technology had left me in the dust. I definitely did not want a SLR, I wanted something that I could use at a moment's notice. I want pictures of my husband, family and friends, my cats, my garden when the hydragenas and roses are in full bloom. I am not doing a magazine layout for Vogue. This camera description was just perfect for my list of wants and needs.  Having used friends' Elphs I was not impressed with the tiny bits as they were just too awkward for my mature fingers.  I verified this was not a problem after I did a test run in a camera store. I almost fainted at the camera store price as it was MUCH higher than Amazon.  The next day I had a message from my Amazon Cart informing me there was a fifty doller drop on the Amazon camera price.  It was kismet!Thirdly, one of the best features about Canon is that you can use their cameras right out of the box, which I did with this one.  Ease of use, set on Automatic, zoom in or out, click and download.  I have used only a few features on this camera and find the picture quality AMAZING!  Amazing ZOOM feature! I waited for the right one to come along and I am not sorry to have done so (husband and camera).  The auto setting takes motion without blurring esp. nice in a high pixel point and shoot.I did purchase two products to complement this camera (also researched and reviewed by PC Junkie) that I highly recommend:Transcend 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6Deluxe Leather Case PSC-3200 (for SX210IS, also compatible for S90)Enjoy the pics!", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot & MAC Smooth Operation!", "Author": "Zamo \"Flamerose\"", "ReviewID": "R2J1QK39LLTFUZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those MAC lovers, this camera works very well iPHOTO.

The manual features that allow you to set the shutter speed or the aperture or both is exactly what I wanted.  There are a number of automated settings (portraits, landscape, indoor) that look useful, but there's no documentation to say what the settings are or how they are determined.  This camera will be a favorite friend over many years if it lasts that long.  I think I'll be able to get exactly what I want in a quick shot when I get used to the camera settings for different lightings.  It also allows you to set the ISO, but I haven't researched how these words from the old days of film translate to a photon collector.  What I remember about my old SLR was that with 400 ISO film I could set the shutter to 1/125 or 1/60 and get a pretty decent photo in low light without blur if I kept steady.

While people may get used to it over time, forget about handing the SX210is to other people.  No one could hold the camera right!

It was stolen out of my car, so I went for a slight upgrade. I figured 210 has to be better than 200, right? And cheaper. More mega pixels. Bigger zoom. Score...Or not.First off... for a point and click camera, it really expects you to trust the automatic features. For instance, try turning the flash on or off. 3 minutes of menu-hunting, people. The SX200 has a nifty little button right on the back (on, off, auto toggle).From day 1, the auto lens cap on the 210 didn't open entirely, leaving a black vignette on all my photos. I had to remember to push it open with my finger, smudging the lens half the time in the process.The LCD is a joke. It's set to widescreen (I suppose for videos), but because of that it adds black sidebars to your photo previews. This makes the 3\" LCD virtually 2\". It's a camera, not a video camera. The screen should take preferance to still photos and make them larger. Put the black bars on the video!I'm returning it and getting another SX200 IS before they go completely out of stock. It was a wonderful camera (although slighty bigger/heavier), and I suggest you skip the 210 and do the same.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worst Canon I Have Owned", "Author": "Dolf M", "ReviewID": "R3B8LWC4NY4PKL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned nothing but Canon digital cameras since the 1MP days...

First: the zoom. It's a 14x optical zoom. Not a 3x optical plus a useless \"digital\" multiplier. It's going to be tough to hold it steady enough at 14x to get sharp photos in all but the brightest conditions, but that's why they make tripods. With this lens you can zoom in on high-up building details or that strange bird across the marsh. I also use it to get photos of far-off signs I want to read.  The other feature - and one I rarely see on cameras in this category - is a Manual setting for aperture and exposure. I admit that under normal conditions I usually leave it on P, or Av or Tv. But once in a while I want to do something the camera doesn't recommend and blur out running water or get a smaller depth of field or something like that.  The M setting is why I bought this camera.I just got back from a trip to Yosemite and I was really happy with the shots I made with it. There is a bit more noise than with my DSLR but nothing terrible. Obviously, this won't replace a high-quality SLR under all conditions, but sometimes you really don't want the bulk. I haven't really used it with the flash but I assume it's about as useless as on most P&S; cameras.I'm giving it five stars because of how well it works for me.  But I do want to mention two little downsides: First, there's no viewfinder so for composing you have to use the screen. In bright light, this suffers the usual visibility problems. Second, the battery life is not very good. If you do a lot of in-camera review and deletions, the battery may not even last for one full day of shooting. I bought two extra (Canon brand) batteries and go out with at least one fully-charged spare on me. I have had to use my spare.

Very slow shutter and taking pictures of my 1yr old boy and 2yr old girl is very frustrating. It comes out blurred most of the time!!! Even when using the children/pet setting. My 6yr old Kodak takes better picture when it comes to moving objects. I don't recommend it for parents whose main purpose is to take pictures of their children who moves a lot and runs around. There's a great lag in shutter, even if I turn \"review\" off. Another negative is, when using flash, pictures came out to be super bright even in distance and it just washed out the picture.

The optical zooming while video recording is what made me choose this over the more expensive s95 (which was $299 on thanksgiving).The manual features are up to the mark, the sensor is not as strong as s95, (low light photography without flash requires an ISO setting of 800 for non-blurred pictures while same would be possible at ISO of 200/400 on s95). The grip of the camera is perfect, I wasn't very fascinated by the zoom joystick at first, but you get used to it! The dial to switch the modes is a little tighter than what it needs to be. Flash quality is excellent, it's only the mechanics of the flash that scares me a little bit. You can force it to open close manually and it also opens/closes mechanically at power on (if your finger is not covering the flash, it will open) and power off.The screen is also excellent. Mic quality is awesome for videos (including the stereo effect). I am not sure if there is an option for reducing the wind disturbance, but at first glance I couldn't see it!

This camera does the job... that is for sure. The first thing I noticed about the camera was that it takes amazing video. In fact the video is better than my mothers video camera she received last year. The only down side about the video is that it saves without any compression making the file sizes huge, but since I can compress the video myself using 'Any Video Converter' (which is free) I have no issues.The photos come out really nice with the flash. Even in light settings, it seems that when the flash is on the camera takes better photos. With good lighting it takes surprisingly sharp photos. I say that it is surprising because you don't need to keep your hand perfectly steady all the time. It definitely is built with some good algorithms for face finding and focus.The only down side to the camera was the blurr affect of moving objects. I was disappointed with the fact that some of my pictures were coming out blurry but then found that compared to all the other cameras that my friends and family received for christmas, my camera was blurry far less often than the others. Some of the other cameras were even priced higher than my SX210IS and could not produce a single crisp image.

Hardy", "ReviewID": "R16QJIDMP4BG4N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi.  I think this is a great camera and am glad I bought it.  Got it on Black Friday 2010 on Amazon for $200, which was a heck of a deal.If you are looking to make a decision, here are some observations that may be helpful.I have been a photo enthusiast for 20 years.  My main camera is a Nikon D40 with lenses ranging from 17 - 200mm.  Have owned Canon compacts for over 10 years.The camera design has one interesting design aspect.  The flash always wants to pop open and it's a smidge awkward to hold, but I am getting used to it.  On the other hand, pushing it back down is a positive switch when you know you don't want the flash.The 28mm is wide enough for me.  The magic is on the long end. Most cameras go to maybe 135mm.  400 is a huge difference.  With the digital zoom on top of that, it's around 800mm which is ridiculous.  I hike and camp a lot, so the 28mm is good for sunsets, etc.  On the long end, I can get shots of shy birds, or shots of things I want to remember but don't want to get so close to - like bears and cougars.  True story.This is marketed by Canon at a semi-advanced user, and one does get shutter, aperature, and full manual controls if you want to use them.  Program mode works very well.  Put it in Auto mode and hand it to someone to take pictures of you when you are out and about.I set mine to \"Vivid\" just because I like the saturated look.Probably the best feature is the command dial on the back.  You can fine tune the exposure on the fly up and down by two stops if you are taking a picture of a high contrast situation and the meter doesn't give you what you are looking for.  That's critical to me.Having the capability to take video up to HD quality is a bonus.  Low light photography is also quite good.It can also overlay a composition grid and do a quick zoom on the focus area to ensure what you want is in focus.It's not a 'party camera' you can slide in your pocket like the SD1400.  This thing has a BIG lens barrel.This is a 'travel' camera.  It's not big by any stretch, but pocketable in a jacket.  Very good picture quality with a long lens.So in the final analysis, I love my Nikon D40 and use it a lot when I am feeling artistic or have a special occasion and want to carry it around.  This camera is fantastically capable, and I keep it with me all the time.  Canon will eventually redesign the flash location.  It's not a deal breaker for me, though some reviewers have a strong opinion on that one.It's not a DSLR in terms of image quality or speed.  But it's 90% of what I could ask for as a hobbyist. This could replace my D40 if I didn't just enjoy using a DSLR.All in all, it's a great camera.  I am glad I bought it, would buy it again, and would recommend to a friend.Cheers,R", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "T.

There is little positive I can add that has not already been said, so I will only list my otherwise minor gripes about an otherwise great product.Most armatures (like me) will find themselves using the AUTO feature quite often, at least until they are confident enough with the more specialized settings, and for the most part it is a great feature. One aspect I like is the ability to focus the AUTO setting to adjust based on the area of the scene that is most important. Such as center, surroundings, and full scene. However if you intend to take a lot of quick shots, it takes a few seconds to 'prep' the shot before it is perfect, which might be irritating... This is also the case when taking video. If you make rapid changes in distance and lighting, the few seconds of blur can be irritating.Another thing is the speed with which the camera actually takes the pictures. Mine seems to pause about 3 seconds between every snap while I hold down the button. And this is even with preview disabled. Reducing the picture resolution doesn't seem to have any effect either. Perhaps a faster SD card might help, but they get very expensive past the 15Mb/s rating. I wish there was a way to speed this up.Lastly, the microphone.

The position of the flash at first sems strange but after you get uesed to it it actually is not bad at all.  You can simply close it if you want to and leave the flash on. I strongly recommend this camera.  It really produces excellent pictures under many different conditions and that is the bottom line..", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good camera, only if you know what you're getting", "Author": "Joe W.", "ReviewID": "R3PH6BESOEYKOS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This review is my personal opinion. I bought this camera elsewhere, but Amazon is still perfectly safe. The SX210IS has a wide screen LCD.  This is great is you like to take a lot of movies.  If not, the screen is just too big for the pictures that it takes. I bought it mistakenly thinking that it could take shots in the same shape as a print, that is 4 by 6. But this camera does not do that. It takes 4:3 shots and 16:9 shots (as in standard and wide screen TVs).  Most folks will want 4:3 and for this, the screen is too wide.  The camera has what reviewers call \"heft.\"  I call it heavy.  Too heavy for my shirt pocket.  On the plus side, it takes very decent pictures and has a number of settings usually found on SLRs, such as Aperture and Speed priorities. In short, if you want a mini-SLR and you don't mind the default 4:3, than this camera will work great.  On the other hand, if you want a second camera, one to just throw in your purse or carry in your pocket, then look for something lighter.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "canon power shot 101s  review", "Author": "lee schwartz", "ReviewID": "R2K3E1UCJSH7ID", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "great little camera that takes very nice images and color.  neat little devices like taking pics with subject wink or when teeth show.  cannot for the life of me figure out how to send images on a mac.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "S.

I've gotten multiple Powershots over the last decade and been really happy with all of them.  So October 2010, I thought I would spend the extra money ($320 versus the average Powershot ~$200) to get one with a better lens.  And THAT was a HUGE mistake.I started noticing problems with the focus halfway through December (convenient - I have virtually no photos of the holidays that year that aren't blurry).  After deciding that I couldn't do anything else to fix the problem, I spent $25 to send it in at the beginning of January 2011.  They apologized, said it was defective, and fixed it for free.Fantastic.Then in May, my lens was having problems retracting.  So I spent another $25 to send it in again.  This time they charged me $150 to replace the lens.  I had a big vacation coming up so fine - I paid the money.  I got the camera back.Then in August, I start noticing problems with the focus again.  So I write Canon, begging, saying that I simply can't do this anymore.  I'm coming up on my one-year warranty, I've already sent it in once, paid an additional $200 for it, I'm over it, I want a new camera.  They were gracious enough to send me a shipping label and said to make a note that I am requesting a replacement.  So I did that.  And THAT'S where my respect for Canon as a company ended.I sent my camera back in.  I got an estimate for $130.  To which I called them in a fury saying absolutely not, that I could not possibly put more money into a camera that simply wasn't worth it.  They apologized, saying it should be free.  Fine.  So a week later, I check on the status of my camera online - nothing.  So I call them - AGAIN.  Apparently it was shipped across the country without my knowledge, the process is delayed by a full week, and they can't make any comments on my account until it lands at the new facility.  Fine.  So I wait another week.  I have to call again (keep in mind that I'm on the phone with them for 30-60 minutes Every. Single. Time.).  They say that they have no idea why it was shipped to another facility, nor why it's taking so long.  So they refer me to a customer service rep who takes 3 days to call me back.  I miss her call (dammit!) and now haven't been able to get in touch with her despite calling her yesterday and today.  I've also informed them that I'm leaving for vacation in 5 days and would like to actually be document the experience.  Look where that's getting me.For those of you keeping track, I've now spent $300 on the camera, $50 in shipping and $150 on a lens for a grand total of $500.  For a whole lot of stress, a lot of time on hold, and very few pictures from the last year of my life.The fact that they keep \"fixing\" this camera and it fails two months later gives me total lack of confidence both in this model and the manufacturer.  I'm not sure if it's a defect within this model (as I've always loved the Powershot and I've heard great things about their DSLRs), or if it's just this particular one that I have.

Terrible place for a flash however you can push it down and raise it up manually after the first turn on so I can deal with that.I have short stubby fingers and holding the camera with ease is a little difficult.  There are no grips and it is a slippery camera to try to hold one handed without some type of curvature. My hand actually cramps up from holding it.  The toggle switch used to zoom in and out is very tiny and I wish canon left it old style  on the shutter button.The lcd is nice but I don't understand why they took away viewing for the entire screen for a picture leaving the sides blank.  You will however save yourself a lot of money purchasing one with a rechargeable battery vs battery operated only cameras so if your thinking about the price think of the $10 plus dollars for lithium or double AA's you stuff in the other cameras and if you use them a lot like I do you will be running to the store frequently.I LOVE all the IDEAS of this camera and so many features but design is \"killing\" it -and me.

I had seriously looked at the Panasonic Lumix ZS6 and ZS7, but chose the Canon Powershot SX210IS, based on reviews and specs.  The picture quality is good, as is the video.  Low light pictures are OK.  My main problem is that the designers forgot that humans have to hold it. The flash, which rises up when the camera is switched on, is located where the left forefinger naturally holds the camera.  Since my forefinger is pressing on top of the flash, the flash does not rise up, and is interpreted by the camera as that I do not wish to use the flash.  Since I normally use the flash as a fill-in, I have to pull out the flash manually.  This is a continuous nuisance.The camera is small and light, and I am afraid it will slip out from my hands. The small hand strap is liable slip off easily.

The top reason is the optical zoom.  Having a camera that is this compact with an optical zoom of 14x is amazing and blows my old Canon SD1000 IS's optical zoom of only 3x out of the water.  Next, would be the functionality.  The SX210 IS is a nice middle of the road offering between the ELPH line and Canon's DSLR cameras, so it has some advanced features that advanced shooters will enjoy but it still retains some of the fun effects that are offered in the ELPH cameras (such as color swap, fisheye, and miniature effect).  Honestly, the 14.1mp didn't sway me that much (I immediately set it to 9mp) but the clarity is amazing.  Another nice feature is being able to shoot video in HD.  I haven't connected the camera to the TV yet (with the provided stereo AV cable) but if it's anywhere nearly as clear as it is on the 3\" widescreen, then I'm sure it'll look quite nice.  I still have to tinker with different outdoor settings but I'm pleased that I haven't seen the bottom corner shadow that some people reported (though I think that might have been due more to poor photo composition rather than a performance issue on the camera's part).

But I am disappointed in some of it's functions. I like most people wanted to find a camera that is easy to use and takes quality pictures, I was also looking for one that had really good zoom.The first thing I noticed that I wasn't totally happy with is that the flash opens right where most people place there fingers to hold onto the camera. There has been a few times that I have turned the camera on and without realizing that my finger is on the flash so it doesn't open. I have to turn the camera on then off again to get it to open.The second thing was the power button is way too small. I have petite hands and fingers, but I have to make sure I push right in the center of the button to turn the camera on. This can be annoying when I am in a hurry to capture that perfect picture.The zoom is unbelievable, but the more you zoom in the more shaky the image gets on the screen and the longer it takes for the camera to focus. This has caused me to miss some shots or to have shaky videos.Lastly, it is not all that easy to use. I am not the best with technically but I'm not the worst either. I read through the manual, but it's pretty hard to remember all of the functions and how to get to them without it. Hopefully this will become easier with time.The camera is lightweight, small, does take wonderful pictures when you have the time to zoom, click and wait.

I mainly used the preset settings because I didn't have time to read the instruction manual before my trip.  As a novice, those pictures came out better than when I tried to control the settings in all but one instance.  After borrowing a friend's older canon for a few shots, I realized how helpful the optical stabilizer on this is to me.  Similar shots with the two cameras came out much clearer on mine.  My only complaint is that it's just a bit slower than I'd like.  I got most of the shots I wanted but was a bit slow on a couple and missed the shot.  I knew that going in, but despite that still felt it was the best camera out of all those that had similar features and price.

Apparently, it was designed for advanced amateur photographers, and offers 14.1 mega pixels, 14x wide zoom, and 3.0\" wide LCD.My purchase process here was a bit unusual for lazy old me: I needed a new camera, so first went online, looked up the ratings of digital cameras.  Made up a short list of likely candidates by price and quality, went to Amazon and checked on the early users' reviews.  Everyone raved about this new one, coming out soon, so I bit.Well, there's no question, the camera is cleverly made.  It seems to have, let's call it, a plain vanilla auto, it doesn't allow manual control of the flash, but it will just take pictures.  Then it's got a Smart Auto setting. Allows manual control of the flash.  And it knows what's in your potential picture: human beings, or just scenery.  Knows when more human beings enter the picture, and adjusts itself.  Also knows if you are in close-up, bright light, backlit light, blue skies and backlit blue skies, sunsets, or dark.  And adjusts itself for all of the above, which is pretty remarkable to me.  It'll shoot short movies of course.  It has manual settings appropriate for amateur photographers, such as people, landscape, night, kids and pets, and indoors and something called smart shutter.  It doesn't have a sports setting, unfortunately, which my previous camera did: guess you'd take sports in the kids/pets setting.  It's also got a setting that adjusts portrait/landscape, and settings for the more advanced that I'll probably never use, to change aperture and speed.I do have a couple of quibbles with it.  It has no built-in memory, and doesn't come with a memory card, so you can't use it right out of the box, unless you've a memory card handy.  It also comes with only a very small booklet, \"Getting Started,\" instead of a full manual, that too makes it more difficult to use right out of the box. The full manual comes on CD as 150 pages of PDF.  I'd prefer to have this information in hard copy, but my little home system can't possibly print 150 pages.  I've been told by other more knowledgeable users that that's the way better digital cameras are shipped today, and I can't argue with them.  So, buy a hard-copy manual from the vendor?  Anyway, guess both of these deficiencies were dictated by the desire to bring the camera in at the best possible price, and it does come at a very good price for all the exciting new technology it bears.

At this price-point it's worth thinking carefully how important mega-zoom and video are to you.  dSLR really is night-and-day better, and though more money obviously, at this price point you probably are considering saving for one, and I'd think hard about that.Last note: stabilization is pretty good for still pictures, a bit less so on video.

But when I bought it and tryed to use it I found it doesnt have a image stablizer (I tend to shake) The instruction say if it shows the shaking image to put it on a tripod (not very often possible). Most of my photos were blury. When they werent blury they were very nice shots.I also found it hard to figure out where the menus were to change the settings, like light, and picture size. As they dont print books anymore I was trying to figure out the camera without any help (yes I know its on CD but hard to take a computer out when you're taking photos).I had some trouble with depth of focus. The camera was focusing on the wrong subject which kept flustrating me.Worked well in low light. And I used the video camera feature and thought for a small camera it did well.

We used our daughter's 110IS in Paris and loved it.  This one is smaller, but I'm not so sure I like the feel of it as well.  My biggest complaint is that the battery is discharging in one day after a couple of hours of use and a hundred or so pictures.  I've written the Amazon seller as it's probably a bad battery, but still.  I'm charging the 2nd one right now (I bought a package set), but if it discharges too, I will pack the whole thing up and send it back.I definitely agree that the mode dial is really difficult to turn.  They could really improve on that.  It's on the top and a bit awkward.  Also, this camera has more features than my daughters (like afore mentioned sepia, etc.), but I have not found the pictures to be as crisp.  I need to play with it a while, and perhaps mess with the ISO, but out of box on Auto, I'm not getting crisp fantastic picture like we got with the 110.  Maybe it was because we were in Paris!In addition, in Auto on the 110, you had a macro option.  Now, you have to switch to Program mode for macro.  That annoys me.  I also don't like the little zoom tool.  It's a small piece that sticks up and you move it left and right.  I just find it a little slow to use.  And agree on the mention of your finger is on the flash when you turn it on, which makes it stay down, even though it wants to pop up.The gold is lovely, so we'll see.  I probably need to play with it a while, but I was expecting WOW, especially in picture quality.  Shots are blurry and a little grainy, but it may be the settings and I need to practice with it.  Not quite point and shoot though, in my opinion.Review Update:It's been another week and I'm sending it back.  Butterfly Photo said the batteries that ship should last about an hour or two of use.  That's ridiculous.  Both of my batteries discharged in around that amount of time of use.  SO disappointing.  And then there's the crazy shadow in low light situations because the zoom goes out so far, it blocks the flash.  I'm going back to a AA lithium based, which lasts for longer than 2 hours.  More like 2 weeks of heavy use.Yesterday I charged the battery, and went to my nephews wedding.  Took about 30 pictures and 20 minutes of video.  Then made it to my daughter's performance, took another 20 minutes of video, and the low battery began to flash.

I especially liked the quick select option for the video. I also liked the CCD sensitivity and the 14X zoom feature. I probably took over a 1000 shots with the camera and had it 25 days. Basically I was comparing the performance to a Kodak Z981 camera, but of course the Canon SX210IS was smaller. I also take a lot of indoor videos of children. I also carried it on several birdwatching trips. I feel I gave the SX210IS a real test and I wasn't really happy with the overall usage of the camers.Cons:I was disappointed with the indoor videos because it really struggled with sensitivity. Part of the reason is the large zoom that reduces the sensitivity and one must be aware of that. I was also annoyed with the menu settings that continully were somehow wrong, and in birdwatching, you don't have time to search around in menues. The Kodak Z981 was so much easier to navigate and get to what you wanted quickly. The only plus that I gave the Canon SX210IS over the Kodak Z981 was a quieter zoom lens action. However, another negative is that the Canon zoom is much slower than the Kodak zoom. I really got poor birdwatching pictures most of the time,and even worse with the extended digital zoom. I tried all of the optional Mode choices and again was frustrated with navigating menu issues.There is no viewfinder and trying to use it in bright light is difficult. I like a viewfinder but it is missing, which is sad on a camera in this price category.I really wanted to like this camera, but I finally returned it because it just isn't easy to use.I also use a Pentax DSLR as well as my Kodak Z981 and I like both of these camera's user interface much better than the Canon.

There are a number of settings that I love using, primarily tilt-shift mode manages to make boring things quite interesting.What sets this camera aside from all others is its amazing durability, this little thing has survived a minor flood (not that I recommend this for pooltime), a number of accidental drops, a few stomps, a toddler chewing on it and an overzealous dog.

Instead, I searched high and low for the perfect compact camera and fell in love with the Canon PowerShot SX210IS. I purchase it in 2010 before my honeymoon to the Bahamas and have used it for multiple vacations since. It will go fully automatic, which is rare in a point and shoot, and it takes amazing photos. I've taken shots in Nassau, Freeport, Cocoa Beach, Miami, Charleston, St. Thomas, Grand Turk, Half Moon Cay, San Juan, Nags Head, Washington D.C., etc. It'll also be with me this fall when I visit Mexico, Belize and Isla Roatan. The only time I've ever had any problem with photo quality is in some low light situations where I refused to use the flash. I prefer natural light and only use the flash when forced to. The zoom is more than adequate and the picture quality is superb. I absolutely recommend this camera.

I purchased this camera, as a \"pocket\" camera,  about a year ago to replace a Canon Digital ELPH SD 500.  That was a mistake.  I have found that the images produced by this camera are substandard, dark and flat causing me to edit and brighten each and every picture through iphoto before I add them to our digital albums.  Further, and perhaps the most frustrating problem, is the verrrrry slow autofocus which causes me to miss many photo opportunities.  I have now gone back to using my Canon ELPH as a pocket camera because it is much smaller and therefore more convenient to carry and the images and autofocus are no worse than the SX210is.

After turning the house upside down for a week, I decided that my camera was gone and needed to purchase a new one before our trip.  After a few days of reading endless reviews, I settled on this camera and I couldn't be happier!First of all, I got the camera about 3 days before we left for our trip, so I didn't have much time to learn how to use it.  That said, for a low tech. person such as myself, I found the camera very easy to use and was pleased with the many different shooting options.  The zoom is the best feature by far.  I was able to zoom in on my son's face as he watched the parade or I could set it to autoshoot and take several pictures in a row as he went around on the carousel or other circular rides.  Some of the pics came out blurry in this setting but there was always one good \"keeper\"!  Other things worth noting are the stabilized zoom (very nice), the large LCD screen, and how compact it is!  Although I wouldn't suggest carrying it in your pocket, it is slim enough to do so in a pinch.  And has the zoom capabilities of much more expensive and bulky cameras.Overall, I love this camera!

I needed a new camera and this time, decided to go a little higher and buy the best point and shoot at the time. Boy, was I wrong. The camera takes great pictures, when you have light. The dark settings do nothing so any picture you take not under light comes out horrible. The 720p video is pix-elated and blurry, and I'm sure is not native 720p, because the picture is horrible. Not crisp or clear. And if you do manage to record a video you like, and want it on your computer, you'll probably end up with same problem I have and the video will be corrupted once its on your computer. I sent my camera in to Canon for repair since it was under warranty to see if they could fix the problem. The RMA said they replaced the motherboard, but when I got the camera back, I was still having the same problem. And for no reason after video recording for 20 minutes, the camera shuts off the record by itself and after recording for half an hour, the battery dies. I couldn't believe all the problems I had with this camera when I've only owned few cameras in my lifetime.

Although the flash sometimes wants to activate, it can eventually focus on demand.I have also taken excellent shots of the moon during several full moon rises.Two things that weigh against the camera are its slow shutter release and the added weight.  This weighs almost twice as much as my S90.  And the shutter release and auto focus can take a few seconds to activate, which can create blurry photographs or badly-composed shots of running pets or children.Image quality is excellent though.  So if you are looking for an excellent macro camera, a decent video recorder and shots of and low-light landscapes or portraits, this is an excellent camera despite the incremental price increase of almost a hundred bucks since I bought this camera.  It's an excellent alternative to other cameras.PRO:MacroLow-LightImage qualityCON:WeightSlow shutter releaseSlow flash", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Companion Walk Around Camera", "Author": "WWJDwithCA", "ReviewID": "R31DCRJNM64UYL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I personally really enjoy photography, and I like to use professional level equipment.  I'm not talking about a having a digital SLR kit either, I'm talking about high quality professional glass, so when I go out shooting I take it very seriously.  But as most people who enjoy semi-professional photography they don't enjoy lugging the equipment, and this Canon Powershot really is a nice addition to my equipment inventory that has really brought some joy to my overall experience.  The macro images are really quite excellent, the landscape images are very good, and the ability to zoom in tight is really quite amazing.  I find that I can actually take many pictures that I don't miss my SLR.  Then there's the 720p video with a very good built-in condenser microphone.I like the adjustments and flexibility of the camera.  You can easily over-ride the flash to fill, you can change the color settings fairly easy before shooting a video, and when changing color and white balance settings you immediately see your changes in the screen.  You really just need to spend about a 1/2 hour messing with the device to figure out how it worked.  Maybe it was an hour, anyway it wasn't difficult, and I didn't have to sit and read the manual.  If you don't know photography you will need to read it, but otherwise you'll be fine.  The function wheel is pretty cool, lightly touch the wheel in any of the four corners and macro, exposure adjustments, flash control, and timer pop onto the screen, so you can make quick adjustments  without going thru the menus.The video quality is not on the level of the still image quality, and I was not able to figure out how to switch to manual focus shooting videos, but overall they are pretty good, 4/5.  Still images don't give you the option of a raw format, jpg only, so 14 MP is desirable with JPG compression.Overall, amazingly awesome all around still and video camera that I can carry in my pants pocket!", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "CANNON SX 210", "Author": "Douglas S.

I like this camera because it has 14x optical zoom, which is great for zooming in on people, but not so great for difficult wildlife pictures.  I was hoping I might be able to take this camera backpacking and leave my SLR behind to save weight.  The key question was whether the zoom was good enough to take the pictures I wanted of wildlife (including birds) that I see when I'm hiking in the National Parks.  From my house (open window), I first took a picture with the Powershot SX210IS of a cooper's hawk way in the back of my yard at maximum 14x optical (not digital) zoom (on left).  I then pulled out my Canon XSI SLR with 70-300 mm lens and took the same shot (see right picture).  Both were outside the typical range of the lens, and both had similar megapixels and file size; however, you can tell the left picture is not near the quality of the right picture.  As I said, I like the camera, but you might want to temper your expectations.  It's great for people, but not a replacement for a real zoom lens for wildlife photography.By the way, I have no problem with the pop up zoom.  I like the option of opening and closing the flash with my finger to suit my needs.  The video is nice, but note that you cannot play it on your computer because it's high def.

I hadn't decided whether I wanted to by a dslr yet and I thought the manual controls on this camera would allow me to learn photography without making a huge financial investment.  It was a great little camera with an awesome zoom lens.  The flash is in an awkward place right uner your left index finger, but I think you would get used to that after a short while.  In the end I decided to return this camera.  I found that although it did have full manual controls, a lot of the functions were located within the camera menus.  It was very time consuming to have to go through the menu to change the aperture, shutter speed and ISO while trying to get a shot.  I ended up borrowing a Canon G9 from my brother that is older with less zoom on the lens, but all the manual controls are located on the outside of the camera via a dial or button.As far as ordering through Amazon, it was an excellent experience as always.

This is her third point and shoot having worn out a Lumix and a Casio both having broken within a year. She wanted a SLR but I knew she wouldnt be able to shelp it around in her backpack so I looked for the highest end point and shoot that had the clearest pictures and HD video capacity, as well as low light ability. This camera had it all. I heard from her by phone that this is the best camera she ever owned, the pictures are crystal clear, easy to use, has all the stuff she loves, fisheye, low light and zoom. She could take shots of flowers with the dew drops on them as well as Sunsets with equal quality. She said, after begging us for a heavy big SLR, that she was so happy with the quality of this camera and this was providing amazing clarity for the size. I also bought another Lumix top of the line point and shoot for her twin brother who is now traveling in Europe. I noticed his shots are not as clear, however it may be how he transfers them to Facebook. They are fuzzy and look grainy which is surprising also for Lumix but they are no longer using the Leica lenses on the lower end models.I researched every camera out there, all the specs, all the reviews, and bought her lots of memory as she will be doing the video magazine for the organization she is traveling with. I think if you are frustrated with the limitations of a point and shoot and need the next level of camera this is really the one to choose. Also I got an open box camera on Amazon for much cheaper than the regular retail. It was in perfect condition, so it really made the deal worth it. My sister also has a Cannon camera and sends me beautifully clear pictures as well from France, that she downloads to my email and look great as well.

I do LOVE the zoom lens, it's the only reason why I am going to hang on to this camera. the wide angle is nice to have too. but more and more, I have been choosing to bring my SD600 with me since it is smaller and in many ways, better. two reasons why:1. for the SX210IS, consistency is unreliable. sometimes I get amazing photos, sometimes they are bad-- blurry (even when I'm using a tripod), too dark, too light, etc. when I get a good photo, it is awesome. but for the most part I feel like I could trust the SD600 more.2. image detail when viewing @ 100% on my computer--- as a test, I shot several photos on auto mode in my living room, focusing on a painting that was about 8 feet away from me.

To compromise its well-designed 14x opt-zoom, diaphragm and flash, the company squish the flash to the corner so it is not very comfortable to hold on the left.

This might be a perfectly good camera for an average or novice user (hence the high amount of positive reviews) but for the price, I feel there are better cameras out there.Immediately I was disappointed by the image quality. The color calibration was way off right out of the box (blues looked purple and you don't even want to know how skin-tone looked)and not only that, but the display screen was somewhat pixelated making it difficult to decipher whether or not the picture itself was any good or not.The flash pops up on the top left corner which is an awkward place for a flash because your hand would be there to hold the camera, so I kept accidentally covering the flash or pushing it down.

Perhaps I am not using the camera correctly, and when I get a few spare minutes (which isn't often) I will read the manual.  In the interim, as I stated, I've had some mixed reactions.First reaction is that the close up shooting on this camera is below par, at least in the auto and easy modes (haven't taken enough time to learn the manual, AV and TV mode yet. Call me old school, but the thought of how some of these modes are digitalized and basically a computer version of reality makes me miss my 35mm.  But, I digress).  I've tried to zoom in even moderately on objects that are close to me (1-2 feet) and am incredibly disappointed at this camera's lack of ability to auto zoom on what I'm going for.  Perhaps I'm doing something wrong, and if anyone has any thoughts or recommendations, please let me know.  B/c I'm definitely not happy with this feature.Second reaction is a simple one.  As a father and soon to be husband, I carry the camera in my pocket with me quite a bit.  I'm extremely, extremely disappointed with the two \"eyelids\" that protect the lens of this camera.  I'm surprised that no other review I've read has noted the issue that I'm having - maybe something in my camera is broken?  Anyway, the \"eyelids\" (for lack of a more technical term) come open quite easily in my pocket, which would seem to me to open this camera lense up to a pretty significant amount of scratching and other damage. Why don't these lock in place when the camera is off?  One of the first thoughts I had after buying the camera is \"I'm going to need a slim case or lens cap if I'm going to keep this in my pocket very often\".Third reaction is that the zoom and longer distance pictures seem to be excellent so far.  I'm very pleased, having used some longer and larger zoom lenses on my 35mm, with how well this camera zooms for a pocket sized point and shoot.Next - there is definitely a delay when trying to take shots.  Kids and pets is mixed - sometimes it captures pictures incredibly fast (esp w/no flash) and others, it's still slow - not good when you have a kid!!  Or pets, which I don't have anymore.The number of different shooting modes is definitely good. I like this quite a bit.  Ditto that with the little wheel on the lower right hand side - this wheel is both practical and easy to use.  I like how the menu comes up when you touch it softly to show you what it does.  I also like how it allows you to scroll quickly through pictures on the review mode.I'm torn overall how I really feel about the camera.  Unfortunately, it seems to be my experience that you need to get 500-1000 pictures before you really have a feel for a camera, and of course, by then, who's going to take it back??  So, we'll see.ps - Maybe mine has a different function or extra mode b/c it's brand new, but the zoom can go up to 56x, and when used properly (ie - on a tripod or other stabilizer), it takes EXCELLENT long distance shots.pps - I have this set up to notify me when you write comments on my reviews.

My two biggest issues were the flash location as my hand would get in the way of it automatically popping up & then the screen would instruct me to manually raise flash which I could not figure out how to do (did not check instruction book as wasn't worth my time since it was going to be an ongoing problem I did not want to deal with)& when I tried using telephoto to close in on small Lego it would not focus well. If the camera was placed directly in front of object with no telephoto the macro mode turned on automatically and took a good quality picture. This is probably a great camera for people who want to use a point & shoot for outdoor use, but it didn't meet our unusual needs.I did not give it a 3 because it wasn't fair to grade it on a purpose that is outside its intended use. People who want to take pics of their kids or outside will probably find it very suited to that purpose.Our $95 older model Canon takes better pics for our purpose so wasn't worth keeping. Returns to Amazon are always awesome & easy. Square Trade warranties can also easily be canceled & refunded, both are great companies that I'm thankful to do business with & I almost never buy retail thanks to Amazon's excellent business practices.PROS-Picture quality was great-Screen was large & very good display-Macro focus on no telephoto was very good.-Great screen info when shooting modes are switched and easy to read without glasses for this over 40 yr old.CONS-Flash is very poorly located, makes it difficult to hold.-Did not focus well using telephoto for indoor use on inanimate objects.-Somewhat \"heavy\" for body shape so not as easy to hold.

Recently I took this camera on a cruise ship, ( left my DSLR at home,did not want to hang a big chunk of camera on my neck) and this camera helped me do a pretty good job documenting my vacations with pics and videos. First of all I hated the zoom lever right away, is too small and flimsy it takes some use to it, the whole build of the camera feels flimsy, is plastic and very light in weight you have to be very delicate in the handling of this camera. The S80 feels more like a camera in every aspect.In the photo side of the house, color acrracy, exposure, metering, focus speed I found it exellent. The image stabilization works well with the large zoom, of course the more stable your the better your long distance shots are gonna come out.I found myself using the presets when I didn't have time to tweak, it worked out fine and i never lost the spur of the moment in any shots. In treaky situations manual mode is the way to go, if you use a DSLR before you'll feel right at home with this camera's manual mode. Also anybody with no experience with cameras can shoot very good pics in auto or easy modes in most shooting enviroments. The flash also works fine and you can increase or decrease the intensity, combine that with manual ISO, aperture and shutter speed and you will have perfect pics all the time.In the video side of the house. In broad daylight you will get a beautiful 720p High def video (mov file format) but guess what; in low light is a different story, the camera manages to mantain color acurracy and brightness but the noise plague is inevitable. In mid to low light the white balance is a little slow adjusting, but of course you have white balance presets to overcome that. Also in low light the focus starts hunting(all cameras do in low light)and some time is really hard to get it back, so I quickly switch to manual focus, avoid zooming and ohh! what a difference that made. That's a general rule to shoot in low light for any camera not just the canon sx210, you have to know your camera well to get the best out of it.I wanted portability and a little better quality of pics and vids than a smartphone.

I am running windows xp on a dell with plenty of ram and disk space. I googled the error message I received when I tried to do my first download and came up with dozens of hits.  This is a common problem for all cannon digital camera's.  On cannons web site they have a \"knowledge base\" for problem solutions.  Among my choices were:  reboot; reinstall cannons software; reinstall windows; upgrade to a newer version of windows; download windows service packs;  etc etc etc....  It is either my fault or my computers fault but cannon takes no responsibility.  I also sent an email to cannon describing my problem in detail and the only response I received was an email stating that they had received my email.  before you buy a cannon google your model number and look for problem/complaints.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Short Changed", "Author": "Robert B.

It touts the review about the guy that's a professional photographer and can use this camera in place of his SLR or video camera. Do not fall because of these kinds of reviews, this camera dose not come close to ANY modern SLR or HD video camera.  Compared to my other Canon cameras (G9 and VIXIA HV30) this camera has a very cheep lens and 14 mega pixels dose not help a crappy lens. You get what you pay for, not what these 5 star reviews say, so beware.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Color of camera", "Author": "Prickly Pear", "ReviewID": "RJBUO98TH71R2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was in a \"purple\" mood when I ordered this camera.  Otherwise, I would have gone with the more conservative gold color.  Quite disappointed that the camera looks closer in color to my \"red\" netbook (I would call it burgundy) than the true purple shown on my computer screen.  It's more violet (reddish) than purple. In fact, I thought maybe I got a \"red\" one by mistake, but that was another camera that came in red. Not all that important, I know; just one of the downsides to ordering online. Writing this so anyone else out there who is influenced by colors will be aware.Before I used the camera, I knew I had a good one because my stepson and son-in-law went ga-ga over it. Now that I've used it, two of my favorite things about it are the telephoto capacity and the fact that I can take pictures without a flash in low light conditions and get a good picture where other cameras couldn't get one even with a flash. It's awesome!!Took me a while to learn -- and still learning -- how to set all the features because I don't like spending time to put a CD in the computer or going to an online manual to search for specific instructions. It's easier to thumb through a paper manual and mark it for quick reference next time.  But I have to say, never having had a Canon before, it's pretty user friendly.  It did take me 3 months, though, to figure out that when you press on the edges of the round dial you get four different menus depending on which side, top, or bottom was pressed.  I kept getting one of the menus, but didn't know how I did it and didn't know how to make it stay there long enough to choose. Even the aforementioned camera nerds couldn't tell me. But then I accidentally pressed a different side and figured it out. :)", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Powerful 14x optical zoom with Optical Image Stabilizer; improved Dynamic mode for enhanced image stabilization\n14.1-megapixel resolution for high-quality prints up to  16.5 x 23.4 inches\n28mm wide-angle lens; 3.0-inch wide PureColor System LCD\nHD shooting capability at 720p with stereo sound plus HDMI output\nDIGIC 4 Image Processor with evolved Face Detection Technology; new scene modes", "Name": "Canon PowerShot SX210IS 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 14x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Purple)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51jNgDgrVrL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0035FZJMG"}}
