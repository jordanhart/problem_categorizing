I bought a different one Metra 70-1763 with Amazon and this one works, it fits on the electrical wiring harness from the radio.  Amazon credits back my account that is why I am still shopping in Amazon; it is a reliable website company. Also if you have this kind of vehicle, it comes with the cd-player and the radio on top, you will need to buy Metra 98-7499 Turbo Pocket for Nissan Vehicle, if not you will have a whole top or bottom of your radio.  Also you need brackets to hold your radio with this Metra 98-7499.  You can use your original brackets from the original radio but you have to do some adjusts with your drills and dremel tool.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Fit", "Author": "S. Fox \"regular guy\"", "ReviewID": "R35KRSX4R9UVB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I installed this in the lower part of the radio and vent panel on a Nissan 300ZX.  I had previously installed a new radio on the upper part of the panel using a Metra install kit .This pocket fits perfectly against the panel and with the screw attachments provided.  It is well built and has plenty of room for sunglasses and other things.  A nice feature is the texture on the front lip of the pocket, which adds a touch of class to the plastic material.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Yup, fits", "Author": "B.

I took out my Din 2 radio, placed this between the brackets, installed it, set up my din 1 radio, and it was done! I wish I had bought this when I first tried it, it's the easiest and most obvious solution. Don't pass this up for another set, you can just use your factory brackets with this!", "Date": "August 20, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000K50GFO"}}
