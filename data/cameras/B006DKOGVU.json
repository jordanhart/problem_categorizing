The issue I ran into was that I needed to split each of the 4 cameras signals to route to the DVR and this Quad processor but it will not work.I believe the issue is the signal level of the camera signal, by using the BNC splitter and trying to send one signal to the DVR and the other to the Quad Processor it dropped the signal too low and I would not get any signal to either device if they were both connected. If I disconnected one output of the BNC splitter to either the DVR or the Quad processor I would get a picture.I have now ordered different Quad processor that has a loop out on each of the 4 camera outputs and hopefully that should work.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006DKOGVU"}}
