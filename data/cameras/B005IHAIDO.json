{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Simply the best midrange DSLR (that isn't even a DSLR)", "Author": "D. F. Watt \"dfwatt\"", "ReviewID": "R1AIOBLUPZENKA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a serially (and extensively) revised review, as I have had a chance to spend over a year with this camera.  It has stood the test of time.  With only very few limitations (outlined below), it takes superb stills and very good video. JPEGs print out sharply at 30 by 20 print sizes (as long as I stay under ISO 800).  RAW images at low ISO will print tack sharp to 36x24.  When paired with the new Sony 16-50mm 2.8 lens (see separate review for this terrific lens), takes some of the best pictures this side of a FF pro camera - if you stay to ISO 800 and under.  The one Achilles heel of this camera is low light noise, but I mostly avoid shooting at anything over ISO 1600, so this weakness is mostly rendered a moot point, and is also mitigated by the excellent sensor-based image stabilization (which gives a 2 stop advantage and works with ANY lens).  This means that the A65 has low light capability of a camera that can shoot at ISO 6400 but has no IS.  For those shooting in the virtual dark, see body text for comments (and confessions).And for those curious about the cryptic header (that this isn't a DSLR), it is a DSLT - meaning that a fixed translucent mirror that doesn't move replaces the standard SLR mirror that has to flop in and out of position in front of the sensor.  That design difference is the key to the camera's unique strengths (and its weaknesses in the minds of many purists).  However, that single design difference allows the much faster and more accurate phase detection autofocus system to be working all the time, including while shooting movies (something no other DSLR can do), and thus gives you full time live view, much faster hi-speed shooting, and a lighter body, but also requires an electronic (non-optical) viewfinder, and with a modest (~30%) loss of light to the sensor (with some attendant noise penalty of roughly \u00bd F stop).  The key issue is whether that balance of pluses and minuses works for you . . . . but for most people looking for the best possible still photography and video, this is, at least in IMHO, a truly brilliant stroke that in one fell swoop removes some of the chronic limitations of the classic DSLR environs.  There are a few downsides, but with HUGE upsides.  Whether its mix of features works for you might depend on what and where you shoot . . . .Pros:1) Best viewfinder in the sub-frame world (2.4 million dot OLED), as bright as any full frame viewfinder, and with far more useful information.  Once you've used it, you may not be able to go back, and optical viewfinders seem frankly primitive and confining.2) Class leading 24 megapixel resolution (at low to medium ISO, yields remarkably detailed images, esp in RAW).  Good dynamic range and color from this sensor (but see last update).3) Many useful shooting modes including panorama and high dynamic range modes (but see cons on panorama mode). Intuitive and yet deep & customizable operating system.  But can be put in simple AUTO and AUTO+ modes for the less technical.4) Full-time live view system and full time phase detection AF for both stills and movies - FAR better than the clunky live view systems `tacked on' in traditional DSLRs, and the contrast detection DLSRs have to use with mirror-lockup during movie shooting.5) Class-leading video resolution (1080 at 60p) with as good video capabilities as most camcorders. Typically excellent video if shooting in 60p, and with option to use either viewfinder or LCD for framing video - something no other DSLR can do.6) Intuitive and well thought-out ergonomics.7) Fast and responsive operation.  Fastest continuous shooting in class (10 frames per second).  Fast focusing, decent menu speed (improved w/new firmware)8) Excellent image stabilization system in both stills and video (and no more rapid sensor overheating from the IS being engaged during video shooting that plagued the Sony A55).9) In-camera GPS (can be defeated).10) Decent battery life (significant battery upgrade from the Alpha 55) given that EVF sucks down a lot of battery.11) Perhaps as good features/price ratio in the middle to high-end consumer/prosumer group as any model.12) Easy access to any Minolta lens and a decent selection of Sony lenses for reasonable money, particularly a superb new 16-50 mm 2.8 lens (see separate review).13)  Ability to remove virtually all CA, distortion, and vignetting in increasing number of Sony lens (firmware-based).  When used with new 16-50mm 2.8 lens, produces very sharp images, w/out any visible classic optical distortions (CA, vignetting, barrel distortion, etc).Firmware correction of classic lens optical aberrations has to be one of most under-appreciated but valuable features of this new camera's operating system.  These corrections work with many popular Sony lenses (now available for virtually all the Sony kit and telephoto zooms and most Sony primes), w/ more included in future firmware. Software correction makes a VERY discernible difference in large prints, and means that these classic distortions are basically a non-issue for corrected lenses (see DP Reviews treatment of this).Cons:1) Some increase in noise at higher ISO, particularly in RAW images without NR (noise reduction).  Not surprising in view of increased pixel density (see #9 below).  But this is clearly the camera's one major weakness, and no sense in glossing over it.2) Despite six firmware updates, several which were supposed to address this, both built-in flash and external flash (Sony's HVL-F42) still yield consistently overexposed pictures.  Can be easily fixed with exposure control but this shouldn't be happening.3) As great as the EVF is, sometimes the view is too contrasty, yielding either blown highlights or `blackout' regions - needs contrast adjustment function.4) Not as svelte as the Alpha 55 (but for those with big hands, the extra heft and size work).  Quite hefty with the 16-50 2.8.5) Limited control options in high-speed shooting modes and in movie modes.6) Screen blacks out once you fill up the buffer in high-speed shooting and you have to wait until all the images are dumped onto your card with poor buffer depth (common problem across Sonys - even the new A99). Why can't Sony get this fixed????7) Resulting loss of live view in high-speed shooting modes can make aiming the camera a bit tricky.8) Switching between viewing photos vs. videos is still a bit cumbersome and awkward.9) Default JPEG settings are both too smooth (need sharpening), and at the same time rather noisy at higher ISO - requires users understand menu options and make adjustments to get best possible JPEGs (set NR to high on high ISO, and sharpening to 3+ gives you the best JPEGs without discernible artifacts in JPEGs).10) Sweep panorama modes often poor in resolution (because of having to remove panning effects and image smear with very high shutter speeds and high ISO?) compared to stitching together your own panorama images from discrete images (i.e. using Microsoft ICE). Sony should fix this as it limits a very useful mode - should be an option to use lower ISO and hold the camera still and move through field of view instead of rapid panning.11) Although the EVF is generally excellent, view becomes noisy in low light.12) Video in low light can be under-exposed, and camera will not go above ISO 1600 for video shooting.BEST IN CLASS SPECIFICATIONS?Although the Sony Alpha 65 might have flown under the radar in the context of the simultaneous release of Sony's flagship Alpha 77, I believe it's actually the better deal for everyone who's not interested in a pro-style body.  It contains most of the high technology of the flagship model Alpha 77, minus the top LCD panel and the 12 frame per second shooting rate (you'll have to suffer along with a measly 10 frames per second), a less complex AF system, and a few other minor `downgrades'.  But the sensor and the EVF (in my judgment, the most important innovations of the A77) are intact.  All this for a significant reduction in Price ($949 for body only versus $1449 for the Alpha 77).  (NOTE: both prices have come down).If you're interested in video, there are few cameras that equal the video specification of this camera, as most DSLRs will only shoot in 60i (often times interpolated from 30p), whereas this camera will shoot a true 60 frames a second in progressive scan.  Still pictures are spectacular, with more resolution than virtually anything outside of the full frame 24 megapixel Nikon D3X.  A large 19x13 printout of a standard test image from DP Reviews studio scene shows the A65 very, very close in resolving fine detail to the Nikon D3x (the previous resolution king in 35mm photography prior to the Nikon D800 and able to resolve detail comparable to 35mm Kodachrome 64).LOW LIGHT PROBLEMS?Although the recent Digital Photography Review (the closest thing to a definitive reference source on digital cameras on the web) slammed the Alpha 77 (same sensor and basic image engine as the A65) for its high noise particularly in RAW, and its somewhat `mushy' JPEG rendering, while I generally agree, some clarifications are called for.  First of all, the default JPEGs can be significantly sharpened.  I run the camera in the `standard mode' (one of several `creative modes') but with sharpening at 2+-3+.  You wouldn't want to do this with a Canon (they are already a bit `crunchy' in terms of their default JPEG settings), but there is no artifact effect that I have been able to find (due to excessive smoothing in the default JPEG definitions?) and this adjustment gets much closer to the maximum detail out of the 24MP sensor.  Also, one can also set the HIGH ISO NR (noise reduction) to high, instead of its default.  This combination gets much more out of the sensor than its default settings without extra noise above ISO 800.  Someone at Sony seems just a bit too enamored of the `smooth' look - almost all of their cameras are set up with default JPEG definitions that could benefit from modest sharpening.  Again Canon goes the other way.Furthermore, DP Review's own images show that even at those soft and somewhat noisy default settings, the camera does pretty well compared to the competition - and really quite well indeed given the high pixel count/small pixel size.  If you look on the DP reviews website, and use their revealing and useful studio scene comparator tool, and pull up images from several full frame cameras such as the Sony 900, the Nikon D3X, and even the pro-Canon EOS-1D Mark IV, the Sony A65 holds its own at low ISO, with frankly more detail than any 2011 35mm camera (outside of the Nikon D3x and the NEX 7), only giving ground a bit as ISO gets above 1600 (with its much higher pixel density as a major disadvantage).  Even there, in low light, I believe that the camera does a credible job, and begins trading off some of its resolution advantage for more noise reduction.  Even in head-to-head comparisons with the A900 (FF 24MP sensor), the A65 does a very credible job as ISO rises - and with the disadvantage of a smaller APS-C sensor.  Admittedly, any FF model (and esp. the newer FF models like Canon EOS 1Dx and Nikon D4 - both low-light phenoms) are going to trounce it at 3200 and 6400 in terms of noise, but realistically, this is not a camera for low light, and if you shoot mostly in the virtual dark I would not recommend it.  On the other hand, I certainly don't shoot at light levels where I need ISO 3200 and up, and I am not adverse to using a flash.  Full frame cameras are going to be significantly better in low light - but they cost anywhere from three times to 10 times as much, are much bigger and heavier, and have bigger, heavier and much more costly lens systems.More telling are the comparisons on a level playing field.  A recent comparison of this camera with the Canon EOS 7D and its cheaper cousin, the Canon Rebel T3i/T4i (at the same price point as the A65 and also w/an APS-C sensor) showed that the although the Canon 7D kept a somewhat higher percentage of its ISO 100 resolution at 1600, the Sony was still handily out-resolving it at ISO 1600. So do take the \"low-light noise\" knock on this camera with a grain of salt.  If you need convincing, check out DP Reviews JPEG image comparator for yourself.  Pixel peepers only.BOTTOM LINE - SONY AND THE BIG TWO?It's all about which tradeoffs you want to make.  Sony made a clear decision to trade low light ability for speed, resolution and detail in better light.  For me, that's a good-to-great tradeoff, but for some others, perhaps not so much.  Obviously, it's just a matter of priorities and personal preferences. You really can't have everything.  In bright light, the A65 is going to slightly out-resolve both the new Canon EOS 1Dx and the Nikon D4 for lots less money, and some Canon devotees are upset about potentially spending seven grand or so when this new pro camera comes out, and getting only 18 MP worth of detail. On the other hand, that camera (and the new Nikon D4) will take good to great pictures in the virtual dark. If you love to shoot in very low light, get one of the new Nikon or Canon full frame cameras (Update - or the new Sony Alpha 99).  Just remember bring a truckload of money for the camera and lens systems!  If you are willing to trade some of the low light ability for: 1) a more compact lenses/body; 2) much less money than a full frame system; 3) some of the better video one can get from a DSLR camera, then this system is for you . . .  and is a very good deal. If you believe (like some purists) that HD video is a modern corruption of the original function of SLRs, you probably aren't someone who is going to like Sony's somewhat iconoclastic approach anyway.Bottom line - there isn't another camera for $800 (body only) that comes close to this feature set, and with impressive speed of operation and ergonomics.  This is a shot across the bow that both Nikon and Canon are very concerned about.  Anyone who compares this to the Nikon 7000 or the Canon EOS 60D (two other prosumer models - with the A65 slightly cheaper than either) has to walk away thinking that the Sony is the better deal - and simply a more capable camera - again except in very low light.  If you're interested in live view, the live view on this is so much better than the clunky live view on both the Canon and Nikon it's not even funny.  It's far more responsive and much faster.  And one look through their dim optical subframe viewfinders, after you've used the amazing EVF on the Sony Alpha 65, and you won't be able to go back to Canikon.  The EVF alone is a paradigm-shifting experience - once you've used it, optical viewfinders in traditional sub-frame DSLRs seem primitive and confining.If you look at Digital Photography Reviews over the last 18 months (the closest thing to a definitive reference on the Internet about digital photography), they have given four APS-C Sony cameras highly coveted Gold Awards in the last year and a half (the Alpha 65, Alpha 55 (its predecessor which also won Camera of the Year from Popular Photography in 2010), the NEX 5N, and just recently, the NEX 7.  They have also given four Silver Awards to Sony (the NEX 3C, the Alpha 77 and Alpha 35, another silver to the more traditional DSLR Alpha A580).  Four Silver and four Gold Awards in 18 months.  NO OTHER CAMERA MANUFACTURER HAS EVEN BEEN WITHIN SPITTING DISTANCE OF THIS PERFORMANCE ON THE PODIUM IN THE LAST YEAR OR TWO. If you put all of Nikon's and Canon's awards in the FF DSLR and APS-C classes together during the same period, they aren't even close to this medal haul. (UPDATE - the new Sony A57, the Sony A99, and the RX-1 all secured Gold Awards from DP Reviews - meaning that since August 2010 Sony has received 7 Gold Awards from the best reviewers in the business.  In that interval, Nikon, Olympus and Canon TOGETHER have secured FIVE Gold Awards in the combined FF and APS-C camera groups (not counting the D800/D800E as two models).This suggests that a subtle but real shift of power is taking place in digital photography.  Although professionals still clearly gravitate toward the Big Two (where Sony has been seen as an interesting distraction and lightweight), there is increasing reason now to seriously consider Sony, and not just in the APS-C segment.  Most believe that Sony is now making some of the best compact ILC cameras (the NEX series), and starting to challenge Canon and Nikon in areas of their traditional dominance.  In the space of just over two years, Sony has made traditional DSLRs look clunky, limiting and  . . . . well, dated.  Unless you are ideologically married to an optical viewfinder - or shoot in the virtual dark - you'll love the A65 and its big brother the A77.  There is nothing better in the APS-C segment right now.  As far as the high-end full frame pro market is concerned, let's see how the upcoming full frame Sony A99 stacks up against the full frame Canon 5D Mark III and cheaper Canon 6D and the new Nikon D800 and cheaper Nikon D 600 (all in the pricy 2-grand-and-up range with several of these over $3000 just for the body).  Although Canikon have completely dominated that market, they may finally have some serious competition, even in the pricey pro camera territory.April 2012 UPDATESeveral interesting new developments.  First of all, the new Nikon D800/800E has blown away the competition in terms of resolution, and with surprisingly good low light abilities too - might be the best sensor residing in any camera including medium format (and it's clearly a Sony sensor).  Then again, it's 3 grand to get the Nikon D800 body (and $3400 for the Canon 5D Mark III), making the A65 still a great deal for almost the same level of detail as the D800.  These two new cameras are about 1.5 (Nikon) to 2 stops (Canon) better in terms of low light noise than the A65/77,  but it will be really interesting to see what the new full frame Sony A99 brings to this heated up pro camera territory - sometime this summer or fall. You will see a full review of both the Canon 5D MkIII and Nikon D800 on Digital Photography Reviews website soon.  I expect them both to easily secure Gold Awards.  Pressure will be on Sony to hold serve.  The problem is, historically, Sony is not into competing in the high-end pro FF arena - two cameras there over the last 5-6 years compared to 10-12 FF Canikons?  Sony has its work cut out given the excellent performance of these two new FF models from Canikon.On the home front, the new Sony firmware 1.05 (for both the A65/77) is a big improvement in several areas - it (sometimes) resolves the overexposure problem in ADI flash mode (still not quite right however), speeds up picture preview (it's now virtually instantaneous), provides correction profiles for some additional Sony lenses (distortion, chromatic aberration, and vignetting corrections) including the 70-300 mm G (pro) telephoto (good news for me simply because I own that lens), and fixes a few other items.  The speed of preview is really impressive.  As soon as you finish the shot, it is available for review on the LCD.  Shutdown is MUCH quicker.  Nice job Sony.  Now if you could just get the flash exposure spot on all the time.June 2012 UPDATENot surprisingly, both the new Canon 5D Mark III and the Nikon D800 easily secured Gold awards on DP Reviews.  I think just to avoid controversy and bickering between the two camps, they gave them both the identical score (82).  Sony's full frame A99 however appears delayed and probably is not going to be out this summer.  I continue to be impressed overall with the A65 and have now taken at least 6000 pictures.  Clearly the one Achilles' heel of the Sony A65/77 is low light noise, particularly above ISO 1600.  However, with the current 16-50 2.8 lens (with F4/5.6 being sharpest edge to edge), I get a full two stop advantage, relative to a typical kit lens which has to be stopped down to f8 get really sharp, which pretty much balances out the two stop noise disadvantage that this camera has relative to a full frame camera like the Nikon D800 or Canon 5D Mark III (shooting at F8).  There are times when I wish the camera had somewhat better performance at ISO 3200, and certainly the RAW files have significant noise at that setting, but Sony's RAW editing software can potentially do a pretty good job with even those somewhat noisy files in terms of cleaning up the noise without losing all the fine detail.  I think if you want to put the extra time into shoot RAW, and use IS, you can mitigate the low light disadvantage of this sensor, although still this is its one weakness.  Again if you are shooting in bright conditions, or using flash, this really never is an issue.September 2012 Update:So where do things stand now that several new competing cameras have been released - including the new Nikon 3200, and the Olympus OMD5?  The Nikon 3200 at $699 looks like a very good deal and is slightly better at high ISO (about a half f-stop) in terms of noise than the Sony A 65/77, with the same 24 megapixel resolution (and basic sensor) as the Sony.  The Olympus OMD 5 has fantastic high ISO performance for a micro 4/3 sensor (better than either the Nikon 3200 or the Sony A65 frankly) and also offers better JPEG definition than either Sony or Nikon (to the point where RAW post processing typically yields little).  The much improved high ISO performance of the OMD 5 also underscores how sensor manufacturers are continually moving the goalposts in terms of improving both high ISO performance and resolution at the same time.  The Sony A65 still looks like a great deal as it undercuts the Olympus in price, and although it's somewhat more expensive than the Nikon 3200, it has a significantly better viewfinder, much better high-speed shooting, and better movie modes.  So . . . the short form of the story is while the competition is getting better, the Sony is still a very solid choice in the mid-range DSLR segment.October 2012 Update:Sony just released its new firmware version - 1.06.  It does a number of things, including - most significantly - improving ADI and TTL flash over-exposure.  Flash exposure is still not perfect, but it's better than earlier versions of the firmware and less variable.  I'm using one of Sony's dedicated flash units (the now discontinued HVL 42 flashgun) and was troubled when bounce flash consistently overexposed.  It's now better but I still have an occasional over-exposure (on both flash direct illumination and on bounce flash), and baseline exposure appears about a 1/2 EV overexposed, suggesting that there is still something modestly amiss from time to time with flash computation.  This was never an issue on the A55 so there is something about this camera's firmware or control system that is still not quite optimized on this point.  In any case, it's good that Sony has acknowledged the problem because initially it looked like they were refusing to admit it.  In addition, 1.06 increases the number of Sony lenses that have built-in firmware correction profiles (correcting the three primary optical distortions of chromatic aberration, vignetting, and pin/barrel distortion issues).  Virtually any lens that you can buy on the Sony website with this camera now has software correction for these classic optical distortions.  Advantage Sony.Some interesting new options in the mid-range DSLR segment. Pentax just released the K-30 at roughly the same price point as the A65.  Best high ISO performance outside of a FF sensor (and full weather sealing - unheard of at this price point), but limited movie mode support (no options for external mic, no dedicated movie button, no still shooting during movies) - Pentax was really thinking about stills when they made this camera, and although its low light abilities are clearly better than the A65's - and anything else in the sub-frame world - if you are not shooting in low light much of the time, the Sony is the more `balanced' choice.  Pentax uses the 16 MP sensor that Sony supplies to Nikon and also uses in their own A33/35/55/57 APS-C product lines, which is the best current 16 MP subframe sensor in my opinion.  Nice job overall by Pentax, so if you find the A65's Achilles heel of low light noise a real hindrance, you will likely love the Pentax K-30, unless you are a serious videographer.  Casual video on the other hand will be fine on the K-30.  So there are many attractive options in the subframe semi-pro or `prosumer' segment.  Still think that for most people the EVF, great movie ability and support, superb 16-50 2.8 lens option (really a G- or Zeiss quality lens for just over kit lens money), great resolution, etc. of the Sony A65 outweighs its one big deficit of high ISO noise, but if you disagree with that, by all means, get a K-30.  Very close to FF noise performance with fully usable ISO 3200/6400.  Credit to Pentax (and to Sony's great mid-res APS-C sensor).November 24th UpdateI have had a chance to spend almost two weeks shooting with the Sony A99.  Very fine camera, wanted to keep it but after much vacillation, decided against that and just returned it.  Here's why - it's just not $2000 better than the A65 for my purposes, although if I was a pro shooter, or shooting mostly in low light, I would have kept it.  Here is how I think it stacked up against the A65 - and Sony is competing not just with Canikon, but with themselves now too - the clearest indication that Sony's SLT environs has really altered the mid to high end DSLR scene.Pros of the A99 vs the A65:1) Superb low light performance, almost as good or as good as the new Nikon D600 and competitive with any FF camera.  Credit Sony's fine development work on the FF sensor for this.  Two full F stops better in terms of noise than the A77/65.2) Somewhat better autofocus performance than even the A77, but only if using AF-D lenses - and not many of them.3) Weather sealed (advantage vis a vis A65 but toss up with A77).4) Better video support and better low light video with much less noise (but see cons).5) Amazing front control dial that really aids on the fly adjustments.Cons of the A99 vs the A65:1) $2000 more - pretty big ticket item that requires you love at least something in the PRO: column a LOT!!2) Weight - with comparable lenses, (15-50 vs 24-70) the A65 is almost a full pound lighter (1200 grams for the A65w/lens vs. 1720 for A99w/CZ lens).  That extra pound really makes a difference.  It's frankly tough just toting around the Sony A 65 with the 16-50 2.8 lens, but the Sony A 99 with the Zeiss 24-70 2.8 is really a monster.3) Lens (and other ecosystem) costs - the 16-50 2.8 (see my Amazon review of this amazing lens) is every bit the equal of the CZ 24-70 for $1000 less - one of the great values in walk around lenses anywhere.4) Speed - high speed shooting on the A65 is up to 10FPS while the A99 can only do 6FPS - both are stuck with seriously undersized buffers - a really stupid mistake that was repeated on the A99 for unfathomable reasons.5) No built in flash on the A99.6) No substantive differences that I can see, even at 100% view in RAW if ISO is 100-200.  Barely (and I do mean barely) noticeable by ISO 400 in terms of noise, but cameras really start to separate only at 1600 and up.7) In view of recent reviews, overall, poorer video of A99 vs. A65 (see Tim Naff's superb review of the A99 on Amazon, and discussion of the video issues facing the A99 - something of a shock given Sony's hype about pro videography support for the A99).Most of this looks like a predictable summary of tradeoffs of full frame cameras (weight and cost vs. better high ISO) compared to their subframe cousins.  It is a real testimony to the A65 that most of the time I couldn't take a better picture with the A99, except when it got dark.  So if you shoot a lot in low light, and have the funds, the A99 looks pretty attractive.  If funds are more limited, the A65 is still a real deal and offers a lot for the money.  The clincher is that the A65 takes good to great video and the A99 pretty average (at best) video.Update February 12th, 2013Some stunning developments that could rock the APS-C world and that have sailed mostly under everyone's radar.  Nikon released the 5200 - an upgrade over the 3200 which used basically the same Sony sensor as the A77/65.  But this new camera has a Toshiba sensor, and one that comfortably outperforms the competing Sony chip.  It shows more dynamic range (one full EV), an extra full bit of color depth, and not surprisingly, about a 500 ISO advantage in low light in DXO testing (some of that emerging from the loss of light to the translucent mirror).  However, even without the mirror, testing this against the sensor of the NEX-7, this new Toshiba sensor is better (minimally in relationship to ISO, but with still 1/2 EV advantage in dynamic range). Technical details aside, it's simply a better sensor, and the first time that someone has made a sensor for APS-C that outperformed the Sony equivalent in years.  But does this mean that the Nikon 5200 is a better camera?  Well if you are shooting in low light, yes, it probably is, although I still prefer the great Sony EVF over the dark `tunnel' viewfinder experience on subframe DSLRs like all the Nikon DX cameras.  But still, this sensor and its low light performance is a major shot over the bow for Sony, the first time in a long time that someone has produced a better APS-C sensor than Sony.  Will this translate into erosion of their market dominance in sensor technology?  It's really kind of a shock given the Toshiba is not known for their sensor technology prowess but it raises some intriguing questions.  Will Toshiba be able to produce a FF sensor that also outperforms Sony's amazing 24 MP FF chip? (powering the Nikon D600, Sony A99 and the amazing Sony RX-1) (see my Amazon review of this quite pocketable wonder camera).In any case, the release of the Nikon 5200 and the pending release of the D7100 (same impressive Toshiba sensor and a pro-grade autofocus system and without an optical low pass filter) suggest clearly that Nikon is doing a `full court press' on the high-end sub-frame market.  The lack of a low pass filter on the D7100 means that it will probably out-resolve virtually any other 24MP sensor, perhaps with the downside of more vulnerability to moir\u00e9.  This Toshiba sensor is a full f stop better than the Sony chip on noise (meaning that is only one f-stop poorer in terms of noise than a bunch of full frame models, seriously closing the gap with pro FF equipment), and has somewhat better dynamic range than Sony's chip also.  This suggests that the Nikon D5200/D7100 will offer a very serious challenge to the A65/77, esp. with the great Nikon ecosystem support.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal Game Changer", "Author": "jstover33", "ReviewID": "RNPVFRJMZA3VL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only had this A65 for a couple of days so let's call this a \"first impression\".  I think one of the early magazine reviews called the A65 and A77 \"game changers\".  I have to agree and think that the engineers at Canon and Nikon are really looking at this camera.  I also have a Nikon 5100 and Canon G12 in which to compare.  Neither of those cameras are slouches.  The G12 is my \"go to\" and I love it dearly (buy one).  Of course it is a high end P&S;, but a P&S; none the less.  So I will base my comparison on the Nikon 5100.Most of my comparisons have been indoor flash shots and a night shots outside.  Pixels comparisons aside (16m for the 5100 and 24 for the A65), I am astounded by how much better the Sony photos are.  And I thought the 5100 was good-and it is, of course.  One of reasons I bought the 5100 was to replace a Nikon D80.  I love having a flip out screen, which it and the Sony have.  I NEED flip out screens, the G12 has one too.  I take a lot of my shots from a position other than up to my eye.  Anyway, more about the A65.The OLED viewfinder is amazing.  For a real thorough review of the viewfinder alone check out a review of the A77 here on Amazon.  The A65 and A77 share the same viewfinder.  First off, is shows the entire image which you don't get with the 5100.  You have to move up to, what the D7000 to get that?  I have to tell you the ability to level the camera in the viewfinder in two axis is REALLY handy.  No more wonky horizons.  I hike a lot in our local PA mountains.  The ability to sight across from one hill side to the other and use the viewfinder as a sighting level is a real cool, but admittedly esoteric use of the view finder.  Once you have the viewfinder tilt and yaw indicator you will be spoiled forever trust me on that!With the push of a button you can zoom in the view finder very easily.  You can turn on and off the information you see in the finder.Here's another advantage in bright daylight:  You can review the photos in the finder with your eye through the finder.  That is another of MANY pluses of the EVF.  I understand Sony has broken some new ground with this new EVF vs. the older iterations of EVFs.  They are here to stay.  My guess is the optical viewfinder will fade (no flames please). This a very big deal.  Using it is a \"wow\" moment as it is a better mousetrap.If you put the 5100 on Live View and compare it to the Sony A65 there is NO comparison.  If you take a photo in Live View you need to wait until the darn mirror flips up and down.  Slooooooow.  A P&S; camera such as the G12 is MUCH faster shot to shot since it does not have to operate a mirror. The Sony just zooms along merrily, click, click, click, click.  Then if you want to mimic a chain gun on a Apache helicopter put it on a continuous 10 shots a second mode.  I had no way to measure it, but I put the 5100 on continuous shooting (of course, NOT with Live View) and it was quite a bit slower with that darn 'ole mirror getting a workout.  Don't forget, though, to minimize your SD card choking on all that data you need to use one of \"Extreme\" SD cards.  I assume you would want that type of SD card for videos anyway (I don't do much video).  A cheapy SD card will work fine unless you want to play machine gun with the shutter.  No matter what, it will not keep up with 10fps for very long.  I am not sure how the other DSLRs fair in that regard.  I did use it an action pistol match my son and competed in.  I was able to capture his flying brass and the Glock in full recoil which was pretty cool.I recently shot some video and played it back on my Sony Bravia 50\" TV (I am NOT, in general, a Sony fanboy, as I currently own Nikon, Canon and Lumix cameras) via the mini HDMI port on the camera.  It was truly excellent.  Another review here on Amazon from an obvious video enthusiast called it \"amazing\".  I won't dispute that.  The quality of the audio seem pretty darn good.  the microphone sits on top of what would be the pentaprism in an arc.  Previously, my videos from the Canon G12 have been on my computer monitor.  I am not doing a pixel peeping comparison.  Based on my experience and web site reviews the video capabilities are probably best in class.Shot to shot comparison is:  A65 is sharper, but with better color rendition.  The only thing the 5100 MAY have over the A65 is perhaps a slightly stronger flash, but not by much.  a November 11th review on a German camera web site came out and declared the best camera under 1000 euros.  I think the camera has maybe two weakness (or maybe two characteristics that are not better than a Canon or Nikon):  the first is that the flash is good but the Nikon may be a bit better.  But no one matches Nikon on that.  The second is that at high ISOs the quality MAY fall off a little more quickly than comparable Nikon or Canon offerings.  That MAY be a tradeoff from having 24m pixels.  I say that ONLY from the reviews I have read.  I have not had any real world comparisons for high ISOs. My comparisons using a flash in a room with a lot of detail shows the A65 pretty much blowing the 5100 into weeds.  I think some have also questioned that the Sony .jpg engine and advised shooting in RAW until Sony refines the firmware.  That may be, but the photos, to this amateurs and non-technogeek, look awfully good.  It is a heck of a camera and a joy to uses.I like how the A65 has a dedicated ISO button for quick changes.  You can modify one of the 5100's buttons to do the same thing, but I don't think it is as intuitive.  In fact, none of the command structure in the 5100 is as intuitive as the Sony's.  I have to hunt for options on the Nikon that seem easier to find on the Sony.  I have had the 5100 for 7 months and only two days for the Sony...Here is a bonus to the Sony that I was ignorant of until last week.  Legacy AF Minolta and Konica-Minolta lenses work just fine on all the Alphas.  Shame on me for not knowing.  When Sony bought Minolta in 2005 they wisely retained the old A-mount.  Why is that important?  You are not stuck buying new Sony lenses.  You can buy good used Minoltas that are HIGHLY rated Japanese made lenses.  I got my A65 with the 18-55 kit lens.  I just received a used Minolta 70-210mm f3.5-4.5 off eBay for $120.  It is MINT and works PERFECTLY.  If you do a quick search there are web sites devoted to rating Minolta lenses that work with Sony Alphas.  Did I say BARGAIN?  The lens I bought I think sold for $350 when it was new.  On site showed it at $625 in today's money (based on the old purchase price) if I recall.  Even if the Nikon, Canon and Sony were equivalent at the same price point (and they are not) being able to use the legacy Minolta lens is a real plus.  (I almost forgot-I had a Canon Rebel XTi.  Had buyers remorse right away. The photos from it just did not look good, but that is dam water long gone soured me on Canon DSLRs.  I love my G12 though!  I realize Canons DSLR are fantastic cameras with lots of happy campers.  A semipro I know that shoots wildlife switched to high-end Canons from Nikon simply because comparable lenses from Canon are much cheaper than Nikon, but that is a story for another day).If you check out eBay lenses.  I cannot recommend one seller too highly;  ddrfam1439.  Dennis deals only with Minolta lenses and is the best seller of ANYTHING I have bought from eBay.  There are other reliable lenses dealers on there, but if Dennis has it I would buy with 110% confidence.I considered the A77 too, BUT here is the problem:  a big price hit over the A65.  Yes it does have a magnesium body and is weather sealed.  If I go hiking in bad weather I will take my weather proof Lumix TS2.  It is quite a bit larger and heavier though than the A65.  They share the same EVF - that is important.  Yeah, I guess it has a couple more focus points, but in real world I don't think that matters.  Sometimes technical reviews focus (to steal a phrase) on pixel peeking and theoreticals rather than real world use.  Maybe a pro needs the A77, but $999 vs. $1999?  I can find other uses for $1000 - more lenses and filters maybe with lots left over for 18-year old Scotch.I have always had Nikons and Canons, but until now, never gave Sony a look.  The buzz about the A77 caused me to check out the line and I am glad I did.  This Sony A65 is like jumping into an Audi S4 from a VW Golf from my Nikon. I think for $999 there is nothing better-at the moment anyway.I will try to update this review over time.November 11, 2011 UPDATE.  Remember the scene in \"Something About Mary\" when the greasy P.I. Healy (played to a \"T\" by Matt Dillon), was lurking around Mary's apartment?  Through his binoculars, he got a glimpse of the body of her prune-like neighbor, but not seeing the face he thought it was Mary.  To his fellow buffoon and voyeur he muttered \"oooof, first chink in the armor, Teddy\".  Well, the A65 has a problem.  Sometimes it will not shut or or start up.  Taking the battery out and putting it back in solves it for a while.  It is acting flaky.  I did check on-line and I am running the latest firmware (1.03). So I called Sony...they are emailing me a FedEx label to ship to the Laredo TX service center.  The camera is working, but I don't trust it to hold the charge as something drained the battery even though the switch was 'OFF' when I was not using it.  I will report how Sony does on service.  It is working so I will use it some, but ship it out on Monday.November 14, 2011 UPDATE:  I updated and edited some of the text above.  AND the camera seems to be working just fine.  I may not sent it back just yet.  I took quite a few shots and video yesterday.  Likely, my 5100 is going on eBay; don't need both.Late November 14 UPDATE: Although it does seem to be working fine now, I think since I have the FedEx (ground) label I may as well send it back to have it gone over.  By the way, when I was talking to Sony over the weekend they gave me the address to send it to.  I then said it would be nice to get a prepaid label.  The rep said, \"we will email you one\".  I am not sure if she just forgot or that is something you have to ask for.  With Sony losing money it may be the latter.Update November 24, 2011: camera was shipped to Sony in Laredo, TX on 11/16 and arrived 11/21.  I received an email from Sony that evening indicating it was received.  I just got a phone call this morning (Thanksgiving!) from a fellow at the service center asking me questions on the on-off/battery issue.  He said it will ship next Tuesday and arrive to me on Thursday.  I have to give Sony high marks to Sony for customer service at this point.  I did feel bad, though, for the fellow working on Thanksgiving.  That was pretty unexpected.Update March 18, 2012:  I have had the A65 for some time now and can reflect further.  It is a fantastic camera with a ton of best in class benefits with only one Achilles heel (very high ISO performance-beyond 1600-is not as good as Canikon).  OK, so what I have been up to?  Buying lots of Minolta legacy lenses (50/1.7; MACRO 50/2.8; 35-105; 35-80; 700210/f3.5-4.5) and a Sony Carl Zeiss 16-80.  Here would be a killer deal:  buy the A65 body and the Carl Zeiss 16-80.  Then add maybe the Minolta 70-210 (a good one if you can find it.  Get the Minolta MACRO 50/2.8 too if you dig closeup work-which I do).  I have run comparison tests on all my lens as accurately as I can...the CZ is fantastic from center to edge.  The Minolta 50 MACRO 2.8 is just about as good, but the 50/1.7 falls on its ass in the corners-at least my example does.  I also compared these lens to the kit lens...the kit lens is no POS.  It is quite decent.  I got my CZ lens off eBay in as new condition for $625.  New it is $800, so it is not cheap.  Some have complained that it has a plastic (well made though) body and not metal (the mount is metal).  Well, a metal CZ lens cost about double this one, plus it is LIGHTER - always good.At the risk of repeating myself...the ability to use those legacy Minolta lens is HUGE.  For example, the MACRO 50 I got in super shape off eBay for $220 (and gulped at that).  The Sony version of that lens now sells for over $500!  I paid only $120 for that 70-210/f3.5-4.5 and it is fantastic.  I don't know what you would have to pay for a new lens with comparable optics and range.I have also picked up a couple of flashes.  You can get a Minolta 3600HS for a good price on eBay.  It DOES have its limitations (head flips up but does not swivel and cannot cut the power).  A MUCH better choice, albeit more expensive is the Sony HVL-F56AM.  It is a rebadged Minolta 5600. It has far more capabilities than the 3600.  Check them out.If you REALLY want very high ISO performance, buy a Pentax DSLR and not the Canon or Nikon.  Pentax blows everyone into the weeds-and they are an excellent value.  As for really low light stuff, such as street shooting, I am fortunate to have a Fuji X100 which does that so well (among other things very well, but with more than a few quirks).", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Review of the Sony A65 DSLR Camera", "Author": "Eric Tessmer \"Honolulu Hawaii\"", "ReviewID": "R15WO8VIYPANEA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Review of the Sony A65 DSLR Camera  by Eric Tessmer,  Honolulu HawaiiOverview:I'm writing this with the hope it might save time for others, since I just invested many hours doing camera comparisons before buying my own new camera.  I have been a biomed technician for 35+ years, so my experience evaluating equipment and its features may be useful to others.Before I purchased this camera, my experience had always been with Nikon or Canon cameras.  I have been using Canon cameras for over 15 years and have been happy with all of the models I owned.  I had no interest in Sony originally, but a friend of mine, who has considerable photography experience, suggested comparing the three top cameras in this DSLR class before buying.I compared the Sony A65 vs. Nikon D5100 vs. Canon T3i.  I also spent a fair amount of time looking over photos, specs, and reading what professional and \"average Joe\" photographers think and feel about Sony and specifically the A65.I started out biased towards Nikon and Canon, not even liking Sony cameras, based on the ones I had seen a few years back.  But some of the reviews and comments about the new Sony DSLR were from nationally known professional photographers whom I respect.  Also, I saw that Trey Ratcliff, the HDR guru, stated that the newest Sony cameras will be real game changers in the DSLR world.  With all of this, I took a closer look at what all the buzz was about.I am a member of DP Review and have posted numerous questions about this camera there.  I have also spent time in camera shops holding, inspecting, and taking photos using the Canon T3i, Nikon D5100 and Sony A65.  I poured over a lot of reviews, professional opinions, specs, and technology, learned a lot, and ended up really liking the approach Sony was taking - not trying to copy, but to truly innovate.  Sony is obviously investing very heavily in their camera division.Look, Fit and Feel:Although the Canon and Nikon have a good feel to them (Nikon getting the definite edge), I liked the Sony quite a bit better because the body felt better balanced, was slightly lighter and smaller, and the button layout was intuitive and had a real solid feel.  Also, the hand grip side was sculpted and deeper with a larger thumb pad which gave a surer, more confident grip to my hands than either the Canon or Nikon.View Finder (VF):Both Nikon and Canon use optical VF and Sony has an Electronic VF.  Both the Nikon and Canon VF were quite small, but were also fairly clear.  The Sony looked very good and I took several pictures which were very easy, especially with the useful overlays (similar to what you would see on the monitor).  Here are the specs:* Eye-level fixed XGA OLED, 1.3 cm (0.5 type) electronic viewfinder* 2,359,296 dots resolution* Magnification approx.1.09x* 100% frame coverageFrom Image Resource Website: \"In a class of cameras that tend to be fitted with comparatively small pentamirror viewfinders, the large, bright and high-resolution EVF of the Sony A65 stands apart.  Unlike optical viewfinders, the size of an EVF doesn't have to be constrained by the size of the camera's sensor, which means it's possible to offer a finder much closer to the size photographers enjoyed when they shot film SLRs.  In terms of size, clarity and utility, the finder in the A65 at least rivals, but in some respects surpasses some of those found in much more expensive conventional DSLRs.  Compared to its direct APS-C format DSLR peers, there is simply no contest.  The A65's EVF is close enough to the quality of a high-end optical viewfinder that it has advantages (the ability to preview exposure and white balance, or to gain-up for working in low light).  The OLED Trufinder that Sony is now using over older EF technology is a very different beast - its 2.4M dots are able to provide a 1024 x 768 pixel display and do so with a progressive update.  As a result, the viewfinder not only gives a more detailed view but also one that's free from tearing.  After extended use, we're confident in saying that it is the best EVF we've ever used.Low refresh rates were often a bugaboo of early EVFs, but the problem seems pretty completely banished with the combination of the Sony A65's sensor, fast processor, and OLED EVF technology.  The area where EVFs completely crush optical viewfinders is, of course, in on-screen information display.  With the whole viewfinder area a full-color high-resolution image display, readout, status and other information can be displayed anywhere you please.  Not only that, but full menu displays are a button-press away, so your eye never need leave the viewfinder while operating the camera.\"I particularly liked the 3-axis level indicator which you can turn on in the VF.Shooting and Controls:Shooting: all three cameras were pretty much the same, but with a slight edge to the Sony, since with Sony, there seemed to be zero lag when the exposure button was pressed and the control layout seemed better.Controls: all were very good, but the exposure control being on the left side of the Sony made it much easier to control your settings while looking through the VF.Photo Reviews and other photographers comments:Of the numerous comments from owners of this camera, the only major negative I read was that it does not do as well in low light situations.  If you do a lot of action shots over ISO 1600 in low light, then the Nikon and Canon will outperform the Sony.  This is due to the fact that Sony has 24MP vs. Canon at 18MP and Nikon at 16MP in about the same size APS-C sensor.  The Sony also uses a pellicle (transparent) mirror.  There's no reflex mirror to raise, but there is a 20% light loss to the sensor.I have the same issue with my current Canon at 15MP with a CCD sensor, which is worse because I cannot shoot anything over ISO 400 without seeing some noise and over 400 it is really noticeable.  I have managed with ISO 400 or less for my quality shots for over three years, so I can deal with 1600 or less.  Thus I still feel the other advantages of the Sony A65  outweigh this disadvantage.  Plus, as one user pointed out, there is a noise-reduction multi-frame mode which allows you to take six shots in less than 1 second and it combines these into one low-noise image for low light photos.  The sample photos look very good.The pellicle (transparent) mirror in the A65 uses the same technology as on Sony's high-end semi-professional A77 model.Another edge Nikon has over the Sony was that several reviewers felt that the JPEG algorithm was slightly better in the Nikon at higher ISOs and recommended shooting the Sony RAW at over 400 to get the best image quality.  In the RAW format, the Sony image quality was judged to be significantly better than either Nikon or Canon up to 1600 and was comparable to full frame DSLR sensors.A bit more information on the pellicle mirror from Imaging Resource: \"The defining feature of the Sony SLT-series cameras, the translucent (or pellicle) mirror allows most light to pass through to the imaging sensor beneath, while a small portion is reflected for use by the camera's phase-detect autofocus sensor.  This unusual design brings three main advantages over a traditional SLR: full-time phase detection autofocusing (even during video capture), improved burst shooting performance, and a modest reduction in camera body size.  This, combined with use of an electronic first curtain, allows the Sony A65 to capture 10 frames per second with less noise and vibration.\"One reviewer, Michael Reichmann of the Luminous-Landscape.com, summed up his perspective on Sony and their position well: \"Never underestimate Sony. They are the new kid on the block when it comes to mid-to-high-end digital photography, but they are an 800 pound gorilla in the electronics industry, and the digital cameras industry is now the electronics industry.When Sony purchased Konica/Minolta in 2006 they acquired substantial SLR, DSLR, and optical lens technology along with staff and expertise.  They also added a licensing / manufacturing relationship with Carl Zeiss, so that they could use that company's lens technology for both digicams and DSLRs. Not to be discounted is the fact that Sony is one of the few camera makers that designs, engineers, and fabricates their own sensors and other semiconductors.  Indeed competitors such as Nikon and Pentax reportedly have Sony fabricate their sensors for them, sometimes based on Sony designs as well.It's now five years on, and Sony has had decent success with their Alpha cameras, and during the past 12 months with their NEX series of CSC (Compact Systems Cameras).  Their A900 and A850 cameras have been the least expensive full-frame 24MP cameras on the market, and last year the A35 and A55 introduced Sony's unique \"Translucent Mirror\" technology - a pellicle mirror that allows extremely high speed shooting, and continuous autofocus in video mode.The NEX cameras have offered up the smallest and lightest weight APS-C sensor cameras available, and have been very successful in some markets. Now, in late August 2011, Sony has announced four new cameras, three of them with 24 Megapixel APS-C sensors, along with a new NEX model with a 16MP sensor, and a number of lenses and accessories.  This isn't just a large number of new products all at once - it's a full-court-press on the rest of the industry.\"DP Review gave the A65 it's Gold Award, meaning it was rated the best in its class.Photo Quality:From various websites, I looked at hundreds of side-by-side photographs of the same image using the A65 vs. D5100 vs. T3i and I have definitely come to prefer the Nikon images over Canon.  But I also believe Sony has a big edge over both.  Even with high ISO limitation, I still prefer the Sony A65 image quality over the Nikon D5100 & D7000 even at ISO 1600.At 3200 both Nikon and Sony images are compromised, but the Nikon is definitely better.Nikon Comparison:I did a direct comparison with the D5100 and here were the main A65's advantages:* Much larger viewfinder - more than 90% larger* Built-in image stabilization vs. none* Faster continuous shooting - 10 fps vs. 4 fps* Much higher sensor resolution 24 MP vs. 16 MP* Built-in panoramic creation vs. none* 3D photo capable vs. none* GPS vs. none* Better light sensitivity 12,800 ISO vs. 64,000 ISO* Faster autofocus phase vs. contrast detection* Much better viewfinder coverage 100% vs. 95%* Built-in focus motor vs. none* More focus points 15 vs. 11* More cross-type focus points 3 vs. 1The main A65 disadvantage to the D5100:* Noisier image at high ISO (over 1600)* Fewer lens selections* Slightly larger and heavier (by a few mm and grams)* $200 more expensive than the Nikon D5100Conclusion:While I initially took a skeptical approach about the Sony camera, I gradually became convinced that the Sony A65 was my best choice.  I made the purchase through Amazon and it is interesting to note that from the dozens of stores and websites I checked, no one was discounting the camera.  They all were the same price - a very good sign of the quality and value of this camera.Now I have had this camera for a month, have taken over 1,000 pictures of various types and settings, and absolutely love this camera.  It both lives up to the hype, and has also exceeded all my expectations.  I have had ZERO issues with this camera and here are some of my favorite features:* Built-in panoramic stitching - fabulous job stitching together a bunch of photos into one seamless photo in a few seconds - all without having to use a tripod - it really works amazingly well.* Noise reduction Auto-ISO - multi-frame merged shots for great low-light shots* Several choices of built-in High Dynamic Range (HDR) shooting modes - with stunning results* Built-in help and explanation menus* Intuitive menu selections and controls* Incredible detail and full shooting information in electronic viewfinder* Easy to use and flexible HD video mode* Very sharp high resolution photosEric Tessmer, CBET, Biomed TechnicianHonolulu, HawaiiTo view some of my photos visit:[...]", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "The A65 is the Answer", "Author": "Greg R.", "ReviewID": "R1PYV1SS2M66RD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the Sony A65V for about a month now.  I'm difficult to please (I'm notorious for taking electronics back when I'm not completely satisfied), but I'm keeping the A65.  I feel like it's the best option around which to build a new camera system.The EVF - While you do lose 1/3 of the light to the fixed-mirror design, you make up for it with the amazing EVF and the camera's speed.  The EVF is much larger than anything else in its class.  It's also very responsive and smooth.  You will quickly forget that you are using an EVF, except when you enjoy the benefits of (a) seeing changes in exposure as you move around the scene, (b) focus peeking during manual focus (outlines what's in focus in red), (c) tons of information on the screen, and (d) previewing images directly in the EVF.  You really don't even need the rear LCD.  I returned the Olympus OM-D EM-5 because of the EVF.  It doesn't compare to the A65.  The Olympus is slow to respond when you put it to your eye and the quality makes you miss an optical viewfinder.The Sensor - The A65's sensor, when paired with a quality lens, allows for extensive cropping.  The intelligent digital zoom, paired with this resolution, is very usable.  Also, the colors and dynamic range are impressive (noticeable upgrade from my Canon XTi).The Handling - The camera is a perfect size.  The menus are well laid out and the ergonomics are excellent.  It makes me want to use it more.Video Autofocus with Phase Detection Autofocus - Thank you.The Speed - Shooting 10 fps with full autofocus when shooting action is much better than the 4-5 you get on other cameras.  Try to take a picture of a player swinging a bat or a couple kissing on their wedding day.  You will appreciate having twice as many frames to choose from.The Gimmicks - I'm not big into fancy shooting modes (e.g., pin hole, retro, 3D, etc...).  But two modes on the A65 are very useable.  First, multi-shot noise reduction works amazingly well for still subjects.  ISO 6400 on MSNR essentially looks the same as ISO 800.  Even if your subject is moving, it will pick the best shot from the bunch and do its best with noise reduction by gathering info from the other pictures.  Second, sweep panorama is better than stitching in Photoshop; sweep panorama takes many pictures and intelligently frames around moving subjects (Photoshop can only work with what it has).SteadyShot - Having all of your lens immediately image-stabilized is a major benefit.  This not only applies to primes, but also non-IS zooms (this makes the Tamron 28-75 f/2.8 a very attractive option).The Bad - You do pick up a little more noise vs. something like the 7D, but it's hard to notice unless you are pixel peeping.  However, the biggest practical issue with the camera is that you don't see the effect of SteadyShot image-stabilization in the viewfinder during stills when you half-press the shutter button.  This drawback does make me miss my Canon lenses.THE COMPETITION - I've used all of these other cameras in the field.  Here is why my main camera is the A65:- Sony A77:  I didn't mind the higher price;  I did care about the weight; I don't need the weather sealing.  The A65 is more fun, produces the same quality pictures, and is less intimidating to subjects.- Olympus OM-D EM-5:  The Olympus is only about 100g or so lighter and doesn't fit in your pocket either.  The lenses are lighter but are not that much smaller.  Noise and image quality are comparable.  However, the biggest drawbacks for the Olympus are (1) the EVF doesn't come close to the Sony, and (2) the low-light autofocus performance and continuos autofocus performance will drive you crazy.- Canon 5D Mark III:  Yes, the Canon will take better pictures in low-light (not much better in good light) by about 2 stops.  But you don't have in camera IS to stabilize prime lenses.  Plus, the Sony's multi-shot noise reduction will make up the ground in noise for still subjects.  Essentially the Canon only bests the Sony in low-light moving subjects, when you'll use a flash for critical IQ anyways.  Finally, the 5D Mark III is way too heavy to be much fun to use.  I was sick of carrying it after one day.  I didn't even mention the price.- Sony NEX-7:  The NEX costs more, autofocuses worse, has an anemic lens selection, and still won't fit in your pocket with a lens.  The NEX, however, has the advantage of slightly better low-light IQ and is probably the system of the future for Sony.  I was tempted.- Canon Rebel T3i or Nikon D7000:  You gain a small amount of low light performance (barely) and you lose all of the fantastic features of the Sony.  I'll take the Sony.", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Packs a lot of punch", "Author": "Damian P. Gadal", "ReviewID": "R2RTCDDG3JORQJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great prosumer camera that packs a lot of punch.  Digital cameras continue to evolve, and Sony is pushing things along nicely.  I wasn't sure what to think of the Translucent Mirror technology, but have to say that it's impressive and really preforms. I've been shooting with DSLR's for a while and was curious about the Sony.After carrying around this camera for a couple of solid weeks and playing around with every setting available, and I can say this is an impressive camera.  It is solid, with no real noticeable shutter lag, and the results are often stunning.There are several things about this camera that I loved.  The first one is the built in GPS for geotagging images.  I geotag everything, so not having to carry around additional equipment to do this is a time saver.  The images come out of the camera tagged (though I'd suggest having your camera on for a few minutes, so that it becomes location aware, before shooting).  I know this isn't a deal breaker and something a lot of folks will never use, but it's an awesome feature to have.The fact that this camera can do in camera panoramic images is great.  This is another time saver.  If you've ever done panoramic imaging you know that it's a process to download and stitch the images together (even though Photoshop has made this process easier).  I like anything that saves me time, gets me off the computer, and lets me shoot more.  I do want to mention that it took some trail and error to get used to the panoramic function, but it's something you get the hang of rather quickly.Some of the other in camera effect modes are fun, like the \"HDR\" painting, soft focus, pop, retro, red (this feature needs a bit of improvement), toy camera, etc.  These all made shooting a lot more fun as I could use them in the field, and see the results then and there.  No long hours of post processing.  And shooting should be fun!I loved the grid features, (use the rule of thirds grid), and level...  No more pesky slightly off horizons that need to be straightened up in post.This camera also shoots in 3D, but this isn't something I can take advantage of right now.  Nice forward thinking though.The live view is outstanding.  Crisp, clear, and it shows you how a change in settings is going to effect your images.  A must have, especially if you're just getting into photography, this will speed up your learning curve, and get you comfortable with shooting in manual mode.Shooting HD movies is easy too.  Just dial in and shoot.  You can even change lens focus while shooting.  NICE.  There's a menu setting to reduce some of the wind noise that the camera captures, which is helpful.Playback is a breeze, and the battery really holds up, but if you're like me and tend to be out shooting a lot you'll probably want to pick up an extra battery.  I have to mention that I like the battery charger, small, compact, folds up, easy to carry, and no cable. NICE.The camera didn't come with a memory card, so you'll need one to start shooting.  It would be nice to include at least a 2GB SD Card so you can shoot out of the box.Face and smile detection, nice features, and more or less standard these days.Anti-dust technology.  Nice.  If you plan on changing lenses, dust is always a potential issues.  Nice to see that Sony acknowledges this and builds in features to deal with it.The one thing I wanted to mention, and is that though this camera works well when shooting in low light and taking long exposures, this is the one area where I really noticed grain and flicker in the live view and viewfinder.... That's not to say the resulting images are effected, they weren't.  It's just something that I didn't expect, and caught me by surprise a bit.  For me shooting in low light requires a bit of extra concentration so that I can get the results I'm after, and I was thrown off a bit.  There's still a difference between looking through glass and at a screen, nothing tragic, and something still being worked out.  Just something I wanted to point out.This camera isn't heavy and bulky, so it's easy to carry around and have some fun with.So, why only four stars?  Just acknowledging that although I think this is a great camera and would recommend it to anyone, it does need a bit of improvement, most having to do with firmware.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "fantastic for a newbie to the \"DSLR\" world", "Author": "bored99", "ReviewID": "R1ESLYCZHDMQWN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been taking tons of pictures for years so I wanted to upgrade from my point-and-shoot (I got tons of compliments on those pictures, and thought I could maybe do more with a nicer camera), but with two little kids in tow, the thought of venturing into the \"real camera\" world was previously too daunting for me. A few years ago I did buy a camera that was a step up, with a fixed lens but wide angle and zoom, and full shutter/aperture control for more flexibility (Finepix S100fs), and I did get some truly beautiful pictures from that camera, but I'd get bad pictures more often, due almost entirely to the learning curve. And because of the challenges, my slower, cheaper point-and-shoot was still my go-to camera for most scenarios.My youngest child is now 5 and I decided I was ready for an interchangeable lens camera, but my goal this time was to get something that wasn't so intimidating that I'd just give up and revert to my old standby. I'm really all about \"eye\" and prefer my tools to be intuitive so I can focus on the scene more than the camera. And the A65 seems to do the trick. I tested the Nikon 5100 in the store, and confess that the menu structure confused the heck out of me. The Canon T4i was the other camera on my shortlist, but I ultimately opted for this one because of ergonomics and speed. Now that I have it, I love it--it's easy to use, easy to understand, flexible enough to do everything I could do on my Fuji plus a ton more. If I ever feel confused there's that little \"?\" button, which gives me more info on almost any of the settings, but isn't insultingly basic like some of the help screens I saw on the Nikon 3200 (not the 5100). From the reviews it sounds like this is a great camera for people who have far more \"real\" camera experience than I do, but I did just want to say that for anyone else looking to make the leap from a point-and-shoot into more serious photography, I have found this camera to be an easier way to progress along that learning curve than some of the other ones I've tried.Some tips for the other newbies:* The screen is so fantastic it will make all your shots look great - don't believe it! Zoom in to double-check that things will look as good up close as they do zoomed out, or you may think you got some great shots, and find yourself disappointed with minor blurring when you get back home* The picture effects are really quite fun, but only work in P/A/S/M modes... so if you don't have a clue what aperture/shutter to use, put the camera in \"auto\" and take a test shot, and then use those settings as your base, and feel free to tweak from there. When I tried this today, it kept defaulting to really wide apertures (in the f4-6 range)... so again, if you zoom in on the display, you'll be able to notice if your depth of field is wonky and requires even more aperture/shutter adjusting. (Bigger aperture numbers--like 20--have more depth of field, and smaller apertures have smaller depth of field. When tweaking this makes your picture way too light/dark, adjust your shutter in the other direction to compensate.)* I enjoy taking shots of an item in the distance framed by something close, and sometimes my camera would focus only on the close item instead of the far. Although I played with changing its metering mode, I eventually just switched to Manual Focus, and found the camera actually makes that easy--as you adjust the focus, there's a tiny box in the middle of the screen that turns green when you're in focus. And it's really picky, so when it's green you can trust that the focus is correct on that item, as you move your camera to reframe the shot. I never would have expected to use manual focusing, but the camera makes it so easy that I actually do it a lot.* Although the \"picture effects\" are really fun and easy to access (the \"down\" arrow on the circular control thing), they include just a \"high contrast\" B&W; or a \"rich tones\" B&W; that takes 3 shots and is sort of interminable if you're doing long-exposure night shots. If you're wanting a vanilla-grade black and white, it's under Function > Creative Style (just above \"Picture Effects\" in the Function menu) > Black and White* \"Menu\" (one of the few controls on your left side) is for general settings; the \"Fn\" (function) key on the right side is the one you want for per-shot tweaking. The camera remembers your previous settings when you've been playing with things a lot... which is great when you're shooting a bunch of similar scenes on a particular day (say, foliage), but if you come back a week later, you may forget all the places you've tweaked things. If it's too overwhelming to remember what you changed so you can reset each item, look in the \"Menu\" choices and find the \"reset everything\" button, so you won't find yourself doing something like inadvertently shooting everything with \"vivid\" color or a way-too-high ISO.* The level tool is AWESOME! Non-level shots were one of my biggest problems in my other camera, and I love this. My only tip for this tool is that you should first compose your shot (everything you're going to do prior to hitting the shutter button), and then level it at the very end--usually it only needs a tiny bit of adjusting, but if you level first and then re-compose, well, you'll be leveling again at the end anyway. Or <cough> not composing your shot, which isn't really recommended :)* Underexposed/overexposed shots - if you click the \"play\" button to see your picture and then cycle through the various \"Disp\" (display) options, you'll see one that flashes at you if you have over- or under-exposed parts of your shot. Sometimes a little of this is OK (for me! maybe I'm not picky enough), but if large chunks of your screen are flashing at you, consider tweaking your shutter/aperture (or just \"exposure\") and trying again* Initially, the \"help\" screen will appear whenever you change scene modes--and remind you about things like the fact that it will fire flash for \"night portrait\" shots. At first this is helpful, but as soon as it becomes annoying, just be aware that there's a setting under \"menu\" where you can turn this off so it will stop harassing you :)* Go online and download a copy of the owners manual--the online version is more complete, and has an \"advanced\" section that isn't in the printed version that comes with your camera", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Digital Toy Box for Photographers of all Levels ...", "Author": "DACHokie", "ReviewID": "R1HNRLSTA5EK5A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an intermediate-level \"camera user\" (I hesitate using the term \"photographer\" as it sounds too professional to describe my level of expertise), I require a camera that simply covers the basics of picture quality, ease-of-use, dependability and maybe a few \"bells and whistles\" for artistic experimentation purposes.  While I do own a true classic photographer's camera (Canon AE-1), I found that I lacked the patience to fully utilize all the amazing features of such a camera.  Things have significantly changed in the digital era as so many of these features (and more) are simplified and more accessible to photographers of all experience levels.  The SONY A65 is a great example of a camera that covers all the basics while including a multitude of nifty features that should serve as a digital playground for novice photographers.Considering my average experience, I honestly found the SONY A65 a little overwhelming at first.  While the versatility of such a camera provided an initial shock, I have grown to appreciate the adventure of discovering its many features, such as:Design:  the camera is \"meaty\".  Solidly built, a degree of heft and a rubber-coated right-hand grip, the A65 holds firmly and comfortably ... especially those with larger hands.Electronic View Finder and LCD:  I simply feel more comfortable taking pictures with a view-finder(old school) and the image clarity of the A65 view-finder is outstanding.  The LCD is amazingly vivid and clear as well.Combination of Image Stabilization and Auto-Focus:  All I can say is my 6-year old daughter shot some amazing photos of vintage World War II airplanes at a local airport by using the LCD for point-and-shoot.Frame Rate:  a whopping 10 FPS ... this feature was perfect for photographing Fourth of July fireworks.Custom Effects:  I am still exploring the customizing effects (posterization, retro, partial colors, etc.), but these are on-board features that provide a palette for professional, artistic experimentation in lieu of a computer photo editor.Panorama:  I like the seamless the \"sweep\" panorama provides over the \"matching puzzle\" assembly my previous cameras required for panoramic photos.The HD Video Quality:  While other cameras I've owned had video capability none compare to the overall quality of the A65 ... it instantly replaces my Sony Camcorder.While I absolutely love this camera, there were a few issues I had with it:Menu Options:  I found the menu options to be a little confusing at times and I am still working my way around this camera to acclimate myself with Sony's menu structure (I am more acclimated with the simplicity of my old Nikon camera).Button Placement:  I have experienced some problems inadvertently pushing buttons (mainly the zoom button) with my thumb while taking pictures.  I believe it is more of an acclimation issue (I have larger hands) than a camera flaw and I am working on simply altering my grip.Low Light Videos:  I found the video quality a little disappointing at lower light settings.Overall, as an amateur, the SONY A65 gives me everything I could possibly ask for in a camera.  The options are almost limitless as I feel I have the perfect tool to take my photography skills to a higher level.  While this may be considered a \"mid-range\" camera from the professional perspective, it delivers on every front for me.  I believe Sony has firmly established itself as a serious player in the high-end camera industry with its Alpha series.I recommend the Sony LCS-AMB/B Alpha Soft Carrying Case for the A65 if interested in a smaller, less cumbersome case designed specifically for the camera.

I purchased it a couple of days ago, and I will be returning it this coming week.  Ironically, my reason for deciding this is just NOT the right camera for me is the very feature adored by other reviewers...the electronic viewfinder.  If you are a traditionalist, I am not sure you will like this at all.  The image you get through the viewfinder is actually so high contrast (especially in bright light) that it is difficult to see the finer details of the subject you are focusing on.  It might do well for people who shoot landscapes and portraits and use auto-focus most of the time.  But I do a lot of manual-focus macro work, and for that this viewfinder is almost unusable.  If I am trying to focus on a tiny insect, and want to see that the little hairs and its eye are in focus to take my shot...forget it.  It is so hard to see details like that with this viewfinder that I almost feel like I'm shooting blind.  Also, as an eyeglass wearer, I am used to having to deal with a bit of side glare when looking through an optical viewfinder, but the problematic effect of that is much greater when attempting to work with this one.Everything is a trade-off.

This friggin camera blew me away. Don't believe people saying that this camera is not a good beginner Camera cause it's totally false and probably said by Idiots who assume that you would be as dumb as they are in figuring things out. Simple Easy camera that can get as technical as you want it to once you get to that point if you're a beginner. Guides you through everything which is a function you can shut off once you figured it all out which should take you less then a few days. Image quality is SUPERB. If you're a beginner the Auto focus will amaze you. A lot of reviews mentioned that it does not do well in low light which i say is false. Not saying it will or won't take better photos then its competitors but that if there where any it would have to be under extreme scrutiny which seems to be complaints more toward low light situations. Well what about everything Else about this cam that rocks against others. It's Clearly a winner for me on many levels.  The EVF (ELECTRONIC VIEW FINDER) gave me the goose bumps. Crystal clear image which will make you want to buy this camera even if the rest of it sucked. The EVF activates when your eye gets close to it and automatically shuts off the 3\" LCD screen which helps in the Kinda low battery life issue.  The camera body is plastic but by far from cheap. If you have big hands would recommend you go feel one first because my hands are pretty big and my pinky does hang off the bottom. Kinda uncumphy but not a major issue at all.  For the beginner....night time shots in the twilight mode is lovely. Now some of you might have flash guns lying around so be informed that it is not a standard one and that you should Buy a cheap($9) hot shoe adapter.  Video....wow, talk about some quick crisp clear auto focus with the ability to do 1080 that will make your videos look like it was done by a pro  Lens is a kit lens so you get pretty much what it Implicates but that's with all cams you get.  Thing is quick as hell but be warned that after taking the 10fps there is a one or 2 sec delay where the cam takes time to dump it onto the SD card so have a decent SD from higher class which will be faster in accepting the dump.  The shutter sound although a minor thing sounds SEXY. That's the word i would use to describe it.  Now....If any of you are interested in this cam or trying to start your own studio I would definitely recommend this cam.  I myself bought a little studio stuff myself which I will put links to below which you might be interested in and I know some of the stuff will not be pro quality I wanted something on a budget that would be close. One thing I recommend is maybe get the Body only and purchase 1 or 2 lens separately. One great lens is Sony SAL30M28 30mm f/2.8 Lens for Alpha Digital SLR Cameras Everyone gave it good reviews and its like an $800 lens for only about $170. Might be able to avoid using 55mm kit  Another Item I bought was some soft Boxes. this was the best deal I could find in my price rangeePhoto VL9026S3 3000 Watt Continuous Light Kit with Carrying Bag with 3 each of 6.5 Foot Tripod, 22x28-Inches Softboxes and Light Heads with 15 45W 5500k CFL Bulbs It is pretty durable. Kinda pain in the ass to put together and if you wanted it for portable use it is doable butnot so fun. But you can't really beat the price. puts out abundant amount of light and its under $200 bucks Reflectors are a must and this one Neewer 110CM 43\" 5-in-1 Collapsible Multi-Disc Light Reflector is awesome. its huge when opened but it twists up to fit into about 12 inch diameter which fits into a bag that is provided.  This was a good deal on an SD card Transcend 32 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card (TS32GSDHC10) about $32  Here is another bargain... SP2000 Backdrop Background Support Stand For Muslins, Scenic Backdrops and Chromakey Greenscreens or Bluescreens Its a background support for your muslin or whateve but for the price it was a pretty sturdy stand. At that price you'd be a fool to complain about it. remember this will be a budget studio.  Now for that muslin you need... CHROMAKEY WHITE MUSLIN 9'X15' BACKDROP BACKGROUND SCREEN Hmmmmmmm. for Ima give this an \"Eh It's OK\" cause it is kinda on the thin side and does need to be ironed but it is only $33 bucks and not so bad for that price so it evens out. and the black one is hereBLACK 9'x15' PHOTO GRADE MUSLIN which is about $30 also.  Need A macro ring? Awesome deal this thing was NEEWER\u00ae Macro Ring LED Light - Works with Canon/Sony/Nikon/Sigma lenses Although it says it can be used with SOny be warned that it will not fit in the shoe so I would recommend a cheap hot shoe adapter as I mentioned before. But this thing is more then Awesome and way worth it. Only $33 bucks  Extra batteries is a must. Because the A65 does not have the greatest battery life. but at this price for these spare batteries You can't go wrong. these TWO NPFM500H Lithium Ion Replacement Batteries w/Charger for Sony A65 A77 Alpha Digital SLR Cameras DavisMAX Accessory SLTA65 SLTA77 Bundle were only $27 bucks. you get two spare batteries that fit into the sony plus a car/home charger. all that for 27 while sony battery will run you about 50 or 60.

Since I had Nikon Lenses, I upgraded to the Nikon 5100 last year.My experience with my Nikon D80 was a bit of a love-hate thing... when it worked, the results were terrific.  However, half the time when I would be going to take a picture, the shutter wouldn't \"fire\" -- whether it was because the camera was trying to auto-focus or because the lighting wasn't right and trying to get the flash to \"come up\"... If it was a posed picture, my family would get fed up with trying to maintain their smiles long enough to get the picture.  If it was a candid -- forget about it.My experience with the D5100 was better.  I didn't have the \"lag\" in trying to get the shot and again, the pictures were excellent.  But things like trying to review the shot was just cumbersome.  Also, sometimes while reviewing shots, I would get stuck in some weird display mode and I would have no idea how to reset it.  In short, the camera was too smart for me.  But it was a Nikon so I figured it was worth the learning curve because the results were what I was really after.I got the Sony A65 and it is so intuitive right from the get go that I can just take pictures -- I don't have to worry about why isn't the flash coming up or why is it taking so long to focus -- it focuses FAST and \"re-triggers\" (takes the next picture) so quickly that you can basically just keep your finger on the shutter and take a whole series of shots comfortable knowing that ONE of them will turn out.With the Nikon, if I wanted to use something other than Automatic mode, I had no idea what I was doing -- with the Sony, I instantly was able to start playing with different ISO settings and adjust exposures without ever having to crack the manual.The one \"ding\" I would have for this camera is that it tends to over-expose a lot of the pictures -- which explains why I have been playing with the ISO settings.  However, it isn't awful and I would have slightly over-exposed pictures than missed pictures any day of the week.One of the things that had kept me tied to Nikon for so long is because I had Nikon lenses.  However, my dad had some professional grade Minolta lenses from the 90s and since Sony had bought Minolta (and kept the Minolta lens mount system) imagine how thrilled I was to be able to use my dad's lenses!!!  To me, that was one of the things I was the most excited about.  So I traded my sister -- she got my Nikon and I got my dad's lenses.I had always figured that the price of using a DSLR was having a camera that would be smarter than I am... however, the Sony -- even though it is a very high-end camera -- is designed so well that even \"dummies\" like me can use it right out of the box.

Ordered the A65 since it has the same sensor as the A77, but is smaller and easier to handle.Right away we noticed the A65 allows for more flexible shooting than a conventional DSLR in stills and video. I found no problem using the EVF for kids soccer games in daylight and my wife was very delighted she can use the LCD to take pictures \"with the big camera\". We use the LCD where it can tilt up to shoot low.  There are a ton of features like Face detection that you would normally see on a Sony point-shoot. This is a really big deal and surprised Sony doesn't market it better. Both the LCD and EVF are excellent. Don't let traditional view points hold you back.Sony really hit a home run with the new 1.5x crop sensor and it's advanced sensitivity and dynamic range more than make up for concerns I had about this new technology. Based on the picture quality, it really deserves that gold award it got on Dpreview.I've own Canon DSLRs and m4/3 systems and played with the NEX. I prefer the SLT over the NEX because better ISO logic and lens system. The ISO stays at normal 100-200 in daylight and doesn't go over 1600 indoors. The NEX will go to ISO 640 in auto-ISO mode even in daylight.The only negative to me is that Sony's jpeg engine is not as good as Olympus, but this version of Bionz is much better than what I've seen on their point-shoots.The AF is extremely fast and it keeps video in focus unlike the Canons, which is another huge plus. I import AVCHD movies into iMovie and have used Aperture for processing RAW stills.The controls are well arranged and build quality seems very nice. Body is made in Japan. No problems. It's a good value for a multi-purpose camera and makes my DSLRs look really old.UPDATE 03-15:  I have found one flaw with the A65. Taking video in indoor lighting situations yields very dark results. For some reason the camera requires a lot of light beyond the normal incandescent and florescent bulbs you have at home. I noticed the A65 is fixed at f/3.5 and 1600 ISO even with a fast f/2.8 lens. I checked my Canon 60D and it performed better, but no AF, and went to ISO 3200 automatically. I don't think this is a design flaw with the A65, just some bad decisions in the firmware because the LCD screen is plenty bright before recording video. Photos are are still quite nice at ISO 1600. IMO a flaw that will be a problem for any parent wanting to record video of kids during the evening or at some inside program.Update 04-18: While the firmware update did not change any video options, based on the IQ with the 16-50 f/2.8, the A65 still deserves 5 stars. The video quality is excellent, just need extra lighting when inside at night. Overall, the AF is very good and I get consistent results. The firmware update reduced time to shutdown and process images, so it's a better camera now.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Digital viewfinder valuable assistant", "Author": "Studs", "ReviewID": "R1XNJTKJ19SBDS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some may see digital viewfinder as gimmicky but I see it as a valuable tool.  I like the ability to change the display, sometimes you may want to have overlays other times your just want to see the subject without the tools in the way, and you can cycle through these all while your eye is in the viewfinder.  I can understand why the purists and the old 35mm users shy away from the digital replication of reality, however augmentation I find to be a very useful assistant, really a matter of opinion.  I highly recommend you play with each in person to see what best fits you.  I will update as I use this camera more, right now I am still honeymooning with it, while I can't offer much in comparison to other SLR's I hope to at least assist someone in their decision.  I tried looking at many different models and manufacturers, watching video reviews, checking websites and such but ultimately handling them and snapping off a few was key for me.  One advantage I didn't realize in store is as you change ISO settings the viewfinder also lightens and darkens, giving you a preview almost of the exposure settings.  Unsure if this is also in traditional viewfinders, if not it is a valuable tool in learning proper ISO settings and shutter speeds.  Ultimately the pictures are what matter, not the equipment and I found the digital viewfinder a great assistant in helping me compose my shots and adjust exposures.P.S. If you buy a Sony SLT don't forget to upgrade the firmware, mine came out of the box with 1.05, went to 1.07 and the user interfaces and picture reviewing sped up considerably.  Windows 7 and Mac Snow Leopard would not mount the camera without a memory card present which was irritating since instructions state to remove memory card for upgrade.  When you remove the card neither OS would recognize the camera as being connected.  The only way I was able to mount the camera without a card was with my trusty old XP machine, not sure why this yet, if I find out I will update, at this time I could not find any answers why.", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "My First DSLR/SLT Anything", "Author": "ShaneW", "ReviewID": "R2G7207YVFO5AO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now i don't expect anyone, and i mean anyone to base their purchase off of my review, i am a super-novice.I have only ever had one \"camera\", a point and shoot canon, over 3 years ago. Since then my pictures have been taken by my phone. Or more than likely, not at all. I have always wanted an SLR, so i can take real photos, not using some crappy P&S; Camera, and for awhile been considering picking up a nikon, or canon DSLR.Now i work at AAFES, And they did not get the camera i bought in the end, but they carried the A55, and the A65.Well impressed with the 10FPS that the 55 had, and even more-so with the 12FPS that i saw with the 57. (shows how much a novice i am if i get excited about that huh?) Anyway, so i got to play with the camera showing it to customers and such, and TBH, I fell in love with it. It had a better feel to me than the nikon 3100-5100 or the canons i have gotten my hands on, all within the \"Under $1k\" Dollar range. After asking some people i know, a photographer mainly, i got positive ideas about this camera as my first camera. (Amazon Reviews on this camera too).  I was TBH saving for the A57, well as you can see i decided to wait one more month and buy the A65, which on my behalf i am GLAD i did so. The feel of the camera is much better than the other 2 i liked.It has a sturdy feel to it, Much better than the Canon t3/t3i i held personally, less \"Plasticy\".It does shoot quiiiite quickly if you have good lighting. So make sure you match the camera with a fast card, like the Sandisk extreme, or extreme pro cards. So the buffer can clear quicker.And get a tripod, if you plan on using BULB, or any slow shutter speed; than you will need a tripod to prevent any movement in your hands.BY the way, If you have a problem with this camera when you unbox it then go to sony.com, support and download the firmware update tool. Update it and Voila! Problems sorted. Noone is perfect, nor are sony, but at least they addressed the issues some people complain about with this camera. (At least the ones they discuss ;) )My review will probably change as i become more accustomed to using this camera, and learn. However i need to buy more lenses(Sony 35mm Prime lens anyone?).

Moving from Sony Alpha A200, which now seems archaic compared to the A65. The translucent mirror design is a gamechanger in digital photography. This camera shares many of the same features as its big brother, the A77. Same sensor, same OLED electronic viewfinder (beautiful!). The A77 has a magnesium body which is sealed for dust and moisture and a few more performance features (12fps vs. 10 fps for A65), 1/8000 shutter speed vs. 1/4000 shutter speed for A65, a bit more ISO control, etc. However, the A77 is bigger, heavier and has less battery life than the A65. For me, it was not worth an additional $500+ for the extra features and heft. Personally, I'm taking the savings and purchasing a great lens, probably the 16-50 Sony f/2.8 lens. The kit lens that comes with the package is good, but not great. In hindsight, I probably would have skipped the kit lens and purchased the Sony 16-50 f/2.8 lens (which comes with the A77 in the kit).Pros: 24.3 megapixels, great low light performance (up to 16,000 ISO), stunning full HD 1080p video (my A200 did not take ANY video), fast, quiet, tons of customization and features, upgradeable firmware (and Sony has been responsive in releasing firmware), many lenses are compatible and available(including older Minolta lenses), cool and easy panorama sweep feature, in camera HDR, selective color photos (e.g., red only, blue only, green only), swivel LCD with 921,000 pixels, long lasting battery, takes SD cards or Sony memory sticks, GPS.My photos are already better!

Adams", "ReviewID": "RJSKGEMYK7NFO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is coming from someone who has been TRYING to stick with Pentax.  However, after trying three different K-r's and a K-5 and all suffering from tremendous front-focusng problems, I decided it was time to change brands.  I'm also a supporter of the underdogs and prefer brands besides canikon...What really drew me in was the feature set.  This resolutions is simply unheard of in this price range, but this camera provides it and does so very well!  I also personally prefer built-in stabilizers, which this camera also provides.  But what really grabbed my attention (and what sets these apart) is the translucent mirror.  You can read all about it elsewhere...  but in a nutshell, whatever comes through the lens is picked up by the CMOS all the time while it's also being reflected to the AF sensor.  So you get live-view all the time plus tremendously faster focusing than you'd normally achieve using live-view.So how's this work in the real word?  Exceptionally well!  The camera is almost always focusing regardless what AF mode is set.  While it can get a bit annoying, it does help keep the image relatively in focus.  Once you tell the camera to focus, it locks in very quickly and accurately.  Even images taken at wide-open apertures are focused spot on.Another nice \"feature\" of Sony cameras are their lenses.  While there's not the massive selection you find with other brands, there are some exceptional deals out there.  Many of these lenses might feel cheaper, but they all seem to have very good glass.  Plus, you can still use many of the older Minolta lenses which can be found for quite cheap as well.I've only tested the movie mode a couple quick times.  Honestly, I still feel camcorders and SLRs are two completely separate entities and shouldn't be combine.  From what I can see, the quality is good, but you still get some rolling shutter effects.  Also, while it can auto focus while recording, it still tends to hunt and most lenses are quite noisy.  If the camera is stationary and focus is locked, it'd probably be fine.  While the video mode is probably one of the better ones among dSLRs, I still wouldn't suggest it (or any SLR) for video recording.My only slight quibble with this camera is the noise at higher ISOs.  While the Pentax cameras wouldn't focus in low-light, they did exceptionally well controlling noise.  The Sony gets pretty noisy at ISO 1600 where the Pentax's were still pretty happy at ISO 3200.  Pentax also did better with incandescent white balance, but a customer WB setting on the Sony has resolved that problem for me.One other issue I have, but very minor, is the lack of advance options.  There are very few tweaks for the camera, but I guess these are saved more for the A77...All in all, I'm very happy with this new camera.

I got the Sony as I had an old Minolta camera that went toast and after playing around with point and shoots, I wanted a \"real\" camera again.  I had been looking to upgrade from the a230 and was considering a number of options from the more compact Nex and the like to Cannon, Nikkon and others.  I had been holding out on those, however, as I do shoot quite a bit of video as well and while a lot of DSLR's and compacts do video, it really wasn't up to snuff for me.  I had also considered just getting a dedicated video camera but really wanted something that could shoot pics and video very well.  Well after a ton of research and months of waiting I pulled the trigger on the A65 and I could not be happier.The camera shoots excellent pictures and there are a ton of settings, most of which have already been covered in other reviews here and else where.  Not a lot of the reviews talk about the video quality and I have to say that it's simply beautiful.  Low light performance was a major factor in deciding on what camera to buy as most point and shoot and entry level video camera's really suffer in this area even in just normal indoor lighting.  This camera is awesome in low light, average light, good light, etc.  It does take a bit of tweaking but the auto focus is really good as well.  I shot some video at the Dead Sea Scroll exhibit in Cincinnati, which you can check out here if you like. [...] view it at 1080 full screen and you can really see what I am talking about.There are a few things to get used to, when in auto focus mode the onboard mic can pick up some sounds as camera lens is trying to focus, if you or your subject is doing a lot of movement.  It usually only happens when you are zooming in or trying to get close up, but if there is ambient noise it's not really noticeable. It's so good at video, that I may use it more for video than I intended.  I have no doubt that you could make a short film very easily with this camera, you would need a few things but at the cost and the quality I don't think it can be beat right now.Overall This is a great camera, Sony really is doing a good job with the Alpha's, I highly recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony A65 camera", "Author": "Bob \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "RHJ1G95B6COMH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned my A65 for several months now and I am still delighted.

However, after conducting research and uncovering amazing reviews of the Sony A65 (such as at dpreview), I decided to purchase the A65 and compare it to a new D5100, purchased from a local store with a good return policy.  Frankly I was stunned at how the Sony captured more \"keepers\" (I primarily use the camera to take pictures of kids) than the Nikon.  While the image quality of the successful shots was generally equivalent between the two cameras, what really distinguishes the Sony is the operational technology built into the camera.  For example, face detection opens up a world of possibilities that I had not considered before - such as the ability to set the camera to \"auto focus wide zone\" and allow the camera to \"find\" a face on which to focus (the camera is smart enough to avoid focusing on extraneous foreground or background objects when it detects a face).  Coupled with continual auto focus, this makes tracking a moving kid a lot easier than Nikon's system (which of course isn't too shabby itself).  In addition, continual auto-focus while filming movies is real and quick, especially when compared to most other DSLRS.  The EVF works just as well as an optical viewfinder, and if one observes any downside to the EVF (I note that others find fault with its low light performance), the negatives are easily outweighed by the ability to interpose important electronic display elements while looking through the EVF (such as a live histogram or face detection), that are not available in the alternative systems.  Finally, the ability to use the rear LCD screen to actually compose shots with no shutter lag (as opposed to functioning mostly as a reviewing screen, which is the case in most DSLR's) is a great benefit -- I find that kids like to see the camera operator's face, instead of the lens.The downside of course in switching systems is replicating a lens and flash lineup.  However, this wasn't as painful as I thought it might be, mostly because Sony lenses (and third party compatible lenses) are significantly cheaper than their Nikon alternatives (in-body image stabilization permits the purchase of non-stabilized lenses, which drives down the price required to, for example, purchase a 18-200 lens).

While I enjoy the camera very much, the presence of these issues sometimes gets in the way of enjoying the camera to its fullest extent:1) AEL/Focus lockIn multi-segment metering mode, BOTH the exposure and focus are locked when the the shutter is pressed halfway, which I consider a good thing.  This allows me to set exposure+focus with one button and then recompose the scene prior to taking the shot.  In the other two metering modes (center-weighted and spot) pressing the shutter half-way only locks the focus.  If you recompose the shot, the exposure setting changes based on the new area.  While in these two metering modes, you have to use the AEL button to hold the exposure.  In many cases, I prefer to use center-weighted metering so as a result, I have to push two buttons to hold exposure and focus.2) Exposure meterAlthough there is wealth of icons and status data on the VF and LCD screen, it is missing a  exposure meter in P/A/S shooting mode!  How can this be on such a pro-consumer lever camera?  Am I missing it?  If so please submit a comment and let me know.  The only indication you get is a flashing aperture/shutter-speed if you pushed the setting too far (greater that +/-3EV).  But you have no idea how far off you are getting away from nominal exposure as you change settings.3) Image preview - zoom in/outIf you press zoom while viewing an image, it automatically takes you to very large magnification.  This is good if you want to check focus but sometimes all I want to see is if the subject has blinked or not.  And because of this feature I have to zoom out substantially or pan around to find the face and check the eyes.  It can take a good 10 seconds and people don't want to wait around for the second shot.4) Image preview - zoom buttonsOn a related item to above, the zoom buttons do not automatically zoom in/out if you press and hold.  You have to press the button for each increment of zooming.  I have counted 24 presses of the Zoom Out button to get back to full view of the image!! I know you can press the center keypad button to fully zoom out in press, but the point is that if you press Zoom In, be prepared to press a Zoom Out a number of times to see a slightly less magnified view.5) Image preview - scrolling through imagesMy 32GB card can hold 3000 pictures but the camera offers no practical way of navigating in this very large space.  The fastest way I have figured out is to scroll down in increments of 9 thumbnails, which can take minutes to go through that many pictures.  I am really surprised at this lack of software support to find pictures or navigate sensibly.  A friend's 2 year old Nikon (D3100??) has the option to zoom out from one picture to 9 thumbnails, to 50 thumbnails to a calendar navigation where pictures can be shown by date taken, all by pressing the zoom out button incrementally.  Oh, and the zoom in/out advance automatically without having to press each time.There are many things I really like about the camera and I have waited years to upgrade my camera (my previous being the Olympus C-8080 I bought in 2003!).  So I am a bit disappointed at not being able to get the full functionality I was hoping for.I am not sure what I'll end up doing.

But I have a major gripe about the Sony A65 and that is in button placement. When shooting raw the slightest touch of the Smart Teleconverter button or Control button - Picture effect causes a nag to pop up on the display and finder saying \"Not allowed in RAW or RAW+JPEG. This is extremely irritating and no way out in the menu selections as this means more button pushing to clear the nag which will pop up every time you change your right handed grip or finger placement.

I sold the A55 and returned the A65. Both for the same issue. These cameras have a major problem with Dust. Either on the sensor or on the mirror. I had to have the A55 cleaned professionally for 80 dollars. I do not change lenses. I had a Sony 18-250 on both cameras. The store employee said that dust enters the camera from the Zoom part of the lens. I'm not sure I believe him but the pictures on the A55 had about 10-15 dust spots after 4 months of use. The Dust removal system on the A55 did not work at all! Which lead me to believe that the dust was on the mirror. The A65 developed 1 dust spot after 2 weeks. Again the lens never came off the camera. The A55 took wonderful pictures, well saturated colors reasonably sharp jpg's. The A65 was a different animal. Pictures were not as sharp as the A55 even with a +3 sharp factor on the jpg's. And colors were muddy. I love an electronic EVF, which is the main reason I bought both cameras. But to have an EVF you need to have a static mirror with an open sensor. I think this is the downfall for these cameras.  The perfect camera (For Me) would be the A55 with an APS sensor and a FIXED 18-250-300 lens. Size does not matter! It would be no bigger than an A55 or 65 are now and an enclosed system would end the dust issue.

I don't know how many people reviewing these sony cameras print their pictures, but I do and the pictures always had a lot of noise in dark areas, weren't sharp, the colors were never vibrant, and I normally had to edit the crap outta them to make them look like they weren't taken with my iphone. They looked slightly better on a screen, but once printed- I would have about one good picture out of 100. And that was the a55. I thought I had just got a lemon or something, since it has so many raving reviews.So! I had a bestbuy warranty and broke the a55 after two and a half years, and because I had a sony zoom lens I could do nothing with, i decided to be upgraded to the a65. Even with a poor experience with the a55, I was so thrilled to get the a65, thinking It would be a better dslt, and I have to say it was worst as far as picture quality goes. Edges not sharp whatsoever [which is the main thing I look for in a photo], colors are faded, when I print the pictures it looks like an iPhone took them. I know how to use a camera, I tried different times of day and different settings. Also, I'm printing the pictures at an actual photo lab. I could get better pictures with a canon sx260.I was very very unhappy with the picture quality, and I showed about 6 other people the pictures and literally all of they agreed. Same terrible noise and grain in dark areas like the a55,, blurry, faded colors. The dark areas don't even have to be that dark to get noise. The pictures look beautiful on the bright LCD screen, but it's a big difference than what your actually getting.However! Some things I did like about it was how easy it is to use, it explains everything as you go through the settings [great for beginners]; how friggin fast it is (which is the first thing I noticed when I took my first picture), and the body IMO feels very sturdy.  Also, the viewfinder to lcd screen with just your eye is a nice feature. Or was that the a55? i dont remember. Besides those things, i was extremely dissapointed, and I returned it and stood at bestbuy  for half an hour debating between the nikon d5100, d5200, and d7000. I want the d7000, but it was out of my price range, so I got the d5100 to just try out a nikon; and mannn, what a difference. Huge huge huge difference. It's cheaper then the a65, and so much better as far as picture quality goes. I was flipping through some pictures last night, and they are so so vibrant and crisp without editing them. On my computer, I was flipping backwards through my pictures and all the sudden the pictures got ugly and I was like, \"what happened with that one in all these beautiful ones?\" And I realized it got into pictures from the a65.Im really feeling the nikon, but I will be returning it as well, this time I'm gonna get the d7000 and take the price hit, because the body of the nikon feels very cheap. I've had it a week and the battery cover won't open. Also, you have to turn a nob on the top of the camera to switch from viewfinder to LCD every time the camera turns on, and I don't use the viewfinder and that's inconvenient for me and made me miss a picture yesterday. The camera is 4fps i believe, and it is a tid bit slow if your thinking about using it for sports. Maybe you can buy a lens. Idk.And one last thing negative about the nikon is I personally don't like the Double shutter noise it makes every picture you take. Besides those, though, the picture quality is so far impressive. ive only printed a few, but they werent too shabby either. I buy a camera for the pictures, really, and if you do too, you will notice a difference in a sony vs. a nikon. I didn't think it would be a big difference when I originally bought the a55, but I regret that choice three years ago. I've wasted hundreds of pictures IMO not using a nikon.These are all my personal experiences and opinions. I don't do anything professional with photography, I just like taking pretty pictures :) and am kind of particular I guess. I'm planning on posting this on the other cameras reviews, too, in hope of helping someone else. I have done hours, days, MONTHS of reviewing a whole lot of cameras; and ended up more confused then helped. Even now, I'm typing into google \"d5200 vs d7000\" :)  good luck camera buyers- your probably torn between two cameras right now, and I hope this review helped.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera Does Not Turn On", "Author": "M.

I would have to remove the battery pack and replace it and then the camera would turn on.  I see that others in these reviews were having these issues and that there may be a firmware update for the camera that MIGHT fix the problem, but I am sorry, that is a HUGE problem in quality control.
