{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Easy Share is Easy to Use for Digital Camera Rookies Like Me!", "Author": "kone \"kone\"", "ReviewID": "R33EHXK2E9EZKO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Kodak's entry into the digital camera market was later than its rivals, the Japanese camera companies, such as Nikkon and Canon.  However, with the release of the Easy Share Z740 5-Megapixel camera, Kodak establishes itself as a real competitor.This is my first digital camera and I am quite pleased with it.  I have been taking pictures with a SLR film Canon camera for over 25 years and was reluctant to go digital, as I had a great set-up (lenses and accessories) with the film format.  Even so, it is readily apparent that film photography will soon be ancient history and digital photography will certainly become the future of picture taking.The Easy Share is a very easy camera to learn.  I spent about 45 minutes reading the manual with the camera in my lap exploring all the buttons, options, and settings.  From that point on it was a cinch to take great pictures, as the camera is so easy to use.  For those who want a simple point and shoot camera, the automatic setting will give you the simplicity you desire.  For those who want more control over the camera settings, such as F-stop and shutter speed, there are settings for these as well.  For this reason, the Easyshare Z740 is a great camera for general use.  It has a very nice flash that pops up when you need it.  The flash also has features that you can control if desired.I bought the Easy Share because I read in reviews it was a good quality camera, and primarily for the 10-power optical zoom lens.  The 10x lens is a good quality glass lens that gives sharp shots.  I love the versitiliy it gives the photographer!  Most digital cameras have 3x optical zoom lenses and then utilize a 5-10 power digital zoom.  The Kodak Easy Share has a 3x digital zoom making the total zoom a 30 power combo.  However, if you have any experience at all with digital zooms you quickly realize that they produce an inferior grainy (and usually blurry) image.  However, because the Easy Share has a 10 power optical zoom, one rarely needs to go beyond this and use the digital zoom.  Beware of cameras that proclaim their 20x or 30x digital zooms and the image will greatly disappoint you!With a 512 MB flash (memory card), the camera will take about 350 pictures before having to download the pics to a computer for storage or printing.  The transfer process is so easy.  My wife, who is a computer illiterate can even manage this task.  The software (computer) program that comes with the camera is very adequate and reliable.The lithium battery for the camera is charged easily by simply plugging the camera into a pod that comes with the camera.  There is a jack on the bottom of the camera that plugs into the pod and charges the battery without having to remove it from the camera each time, a feature that is very simple and handy.The camera itself is much smaller than a standard 35 mm film camera so it goes anywhere with you.  The controls are well-placed and easy to use.  After a session or two of practice shooting, you will be able to operate the controls like a pro.Finally, there is of course a color LCD screen that shows you the picture you just shot.  There are additional controls that allow you to scroll through all your pictures, delete those you don't want, and save those you want to keep.  Again, it is all very easy to learn.  Coming from a film camera background, I found this editing feature to be the best aspect of digital photography, for there is no guessing as to whether you got the shot or not - it is right there on the screen in living color!  If you don't like the exposure or cropping, simply take another one!  In digital photography, there is no \"wasting film\"!All in all, this is a solid digital camera that will please anyone interested in getting into digital photography.  The price is very competitive considering the extensive options that Kodak packaged into this deal.  If you are just getting into digital photography or are looking to upgrade to a higher megapixel camera, the Easy share will not disappoint you. I highly recommend it.Jim Konedog Koenig", "Date": "July 30, 2005"}, {"Title": "This camera does so much!!", "Author": "Sara-s", "ReviewID": "R3DVLBH58NF00U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Kodak z740 primarily for the high resolution and the 10x zoom, both of which are worth every penny.  Once I got the camera, I discovered that it has far more to offer.  It is surprisingly compact and lightweight.  I found it easy to learn and operate, plus it has all the different shooting modes.Here's what I love about it:1)You can figure out how to use it with very little trouble. (But read the manual, to get some helpful tips.)2)All the different shooting modes allow you to get shots you might otherwise miss.3)The burst mode, for action shots is awesome.  I was able to get sharply focused shots of ducks flapping their wings.4)The camera has good ergonomic design; the grip is comfortable and the buttons can be worked with ease.5)It is designed to accept accessories, such as filters and a wide angle lens.A couple of hints:1)The flash pops up automatically when the camera is turned on.  This is normal.  If it bothers you, just hold your finger over it, when you power up.2)The wide angle lens gets in the way of the flash, so wide-angle shots may come out too dark.  If you switch the camera to night mode, it should solve this problem.3)Kodak sells accessories for the camera, but they are pricey.  Look on line for other companies that sell compatible accessories for less.4)It's a great camera. Have fun with it!!!", "Date": "October 31, 2005"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Camera", "Author": "SCRinMemphis", "ReviewID": "R1GAIFZN4GXL1W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Want a camera that is easy to operate, takes great pictures, and as \"affordable\"? Our family highly recommends this camera.We came into the search with several basic criteria:1) It must be easy to use (no background in FORTRAN or C++ required)2) High quality (5 mpx)3) Fast recovery time4) Easy to move photos to the computer and print5) AA Batteries if possible6) 5-10x zoomI was shocked to see the Z740 met each of these to our satisfaction.It seemed that when we were researching, we'd find a camera that was 5 mpx, took AA's, but had a 5-6 sec recovery. Or another camera would have a 2-3 sec recovery, 5 px, but had a non-standard battery type.We were about to give up and just buy the one that \"most\" fit our criteria -then a friend recommended the Z740. We've been amazed.You select the picture mode by rotating a dial. Within seconds, you can take a video, rotate the dial, and take a still shot - No searching the menu to put it in video mode - just rotate the dial.Focus is \"point and shoot\" - a set of brackets resizes to show you what the camera is focusing on and then turn green.Picture review is easy - a single button push puts you in \"review\" mode - You can then zoom in or out on your picture.Transfer the pictures by simply placing the camera on its docking station / printer, then push a button.The computer software is fairly intuitive, though those who use other photo programs like Adobe Photoshop or Corel Photopaint may find it a bit basic.The little printer prints GREAT photos - but they are expensive (Kodak propriety paper and ink ribbon) - $25 for 40 prints; still, it does a great job of printing \"waterproof\" prints. To print, you just hit the \"print\" after you dock the camera, or you can print your photos from the computer to your desktop printer, OR you can send pictures in to a photo developer (local camera shop, Sam's, Costco, etc.) to print only photos you want.My wife does scrapbooking and it is ideal for her.We highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "May 3, 2005"}, {"Title": "Easy to use with high quality", "Author": "Dergie", "ReviewID": "R3HWJYJ082DNIR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a reasonably prices 10x zoom camera that is easy to use and takes great pictures then this is your camera.  I looked around at several different types of camera's including Digital SLR but settled in on the Z740.  For my general use picture taking it has enough features and quality.  It is a little slow between pictures but that is not new to me as a digital camera owner.  If you need to take hundreds of pictures a minute this is not your camera.  The on screen descriptions when you change settings on the camera were a nice addition for me (I never knew what half the stuff on my last camera was for).", "Date": "November 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Finally ...takes Lithium CRV3 Batteries!

Gioia", "ReviewID": "R35XHH9ZUIK4P8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Previously, I owned a Canon digital that I was very happy with, but it was only a 2mp with 3x optical zoom. So if I was ever going to get a new one, I was going to upgrade. After having it for about 6 years, it has started to die on me.  My job requires me to use and sell cameras and to develop film, so you can only imagine how hard it was for me not to buy a camera everytime I saw a new one come out. They only get better every year! I actually was in the market for the 6490 model, but it was discontinued, so then I was researching the 7590 and waiting for a good price. Then I found this one on the Kodak website, and it is almost exactly like the 7590, except it takes AA's instead of the rechargeable lithium battery, which I really wanted. After further looking I found a really good deal on the Z740 so I had to buy it! I will say that I am impressed with the life of the battery that came with it. I still haven't had to change it and I have had the camera for about two months. I have used both the viewfinder and the LCD screen and I have taken lots of video and still no dead battery. After selling and using digital cameras for over 6 years, I will have to say that this is one of the best! The only thing better would be an slr digital,but I don't have the $1,000 or more to pay for one and although I would like to be, I am not a professional photographer, so this one is perfect. Also, as an added note.. When I sell to customers that have never used a digital before, I usually suggest a Kodak, I have found that  Kodak has the most user friendly cameras. Good Luck and I hope you find the perfect camera for you, I know I did!!!", "Date": "October 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great camera at a great price", "Author": "J. Willis \"James A Willis\"", "ReviewID": "R3JQS1W62OXRUK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I took time to review many different models. I and my family are average users, looking for the best price versus features versus ease of use. After reading the rave reviews of the Z740 I decided to purchase it. Amazon had the best price hands down--about $30 less than anyone else. There was no sales tax required with Amazon, and it was delivered inside of 4 days (free shipping).We have not been disappointed! This camera is very easy to use, and it takes amazing pictures. With 10X optical zoom and 5 megapixels, the clarity and color are superb. TIP#1: Forget digital zoom when you evaluate cameras--digital zoom makes little dots bigger and is fairly useless because the pictures become less crisp when using digital zoom. You want as much optical zoom as you can get. TIP#2: Get extra storage for your pictures. I purchased a 1 GB SD card at Staples (about $65 after rebates and discounts) and can easily store at least 400 high quality pictures.As a bonus I decided to subscribe to the Kodak Gallery ([...]) to share the pictures we take--a great service and easy to use.This is a great camera, and Amazon is a great company. A very satisfying online purchase.", "Date": "August 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "Quite possibly the best digital camera under $300 (for right now)", "Author": "KMR", "ReviewID": "R23VHF6JIRWQE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Seldom does anyone ever find a product where EVERY single reviewer has given it a positive rating and positive feedback.  That was one of my research criteria that swayed me into purchasing after I narrowing down the field of cameras I was looking at.My search for a new digital camera started in May 05, when on a trip to London, I was frustrated by my older digital camera's (an Olympus) inability to zoom in tightly on far away objects.  This in spite of the cameras large megapixel capture size, but only a 12x overall zoom (4x optical and 3x digital).  I knew the key to my search was finding a consumer grade camera with a very high optical zoom, which not only lets you zoom in further, but the better the optical lens, the better your photos.The short list included cameras from the usual suspects, Canon, Nikon, and Olympus.  The Kodak Z740 also made that list as it had comparable features, and comparable zoom, to the $450+ competitors.  The one thing lacking in the Kodak, image stabilization, which is probably the one reason that the Kodak is priced quite a bit lower than its nearest competitors.  I decided that image stabilization was not too important to me, and I am glad I made that choice.  Afterall, I already own a tripod, so if composing a very detailed shot that requires the camera to be super steady, I can mount the camera and have all the stabilization I require.  Problem solved.That said, the Kodak Z740 takes beautiful shots.  It allows the user to tailor many settings in order to get things just right, and even in automode, the quality of the output is quite admirable.  The SLR type body means is quite nice also, with the flash positioned directly above the lens and the flash is also pretty decent pop-up variety that does a very good job (unlike other digital cameras).  Other cool features?  The burst shooting modes work well and I am quite pleased with what I was able to achieve while focusing on a moving object in burst mode.Another nice feature is that standard 55mm lenses can be installed on the Z740 body with a lens adaptor.  This again gives the Z740 lots of expandability and customization for the user.Grips?  Lens cover sucks (as mentioned by others), it does not fit as well as it could.  The LCD screen does not seem to provide true color in relation to the actual output of the photo.  My older Olympus displayed colors MUCH better on the LCD.Like I said for under $300, this is probably the best camera you can purchase.  If you are patient you can find it occasionally at name brand retailers for $240, which is the price I purchased at.", "Date": "December 27, 2005"}, {"Title": "Lovely replacement camera", "Author": "Syouki", "ReviewID": "R1RKKPKDQD7ODP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my Kodak DX4330 that was stolen earlier this year.  I love how easy this camera is to use and the quality as well as zoom.  The outside colors are wonderful.  My only problem with the camera is the quality of the inside colors.  I've tried various settings and they continue to come out rather a little dark unlike my 4330.  I still love this camera though and wouldn't change it for any other camera.  Thank you Kodak for another lovely camera.  The 10x zoom is one of the things that got me to purchase this.And I agree that I'd like to be able to zoom while filming, but the first time I used the video feature was at a United Way truck pull infront of my place of employment as I had to film and take photos.

I loved that camera, until I loaned it out and it came back ruined.  The model was unfortunately discontinued, so I scouted all brands, but ended up back with Kodak and this particular model.Selling points - (1) the price for a 5MP was very competitive; (2) the 10x zoom is amazing; (3) it comes with a great variety of photo-enablers which are very helpful to the point&shoot; novice, but also can be used manually for the professional; (4) if the 10x capability isn't enough for you addtional lenses can be added.Drawbacks - (1) the size, I thought that it was smaller than it is, but with the 10x lens apparatus, it gets bulky; (2) a bit big and an awkward shape for storing in a backpack for quick access; (3) the lens cover is a drag, it doesn't stay on! - a better design would be one of those automatic lens close-ups.But, nonetheless, this is a fine camera for people who want an excellent value, many features and top quality pictures.", "Date": "September 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "Ryan Lynch", "ReviewID": "R2Y68ZRLJ07F0W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Camera is remarkable.

That goes to show you how far digital photography has come these days. - One thing that makes this camera stand out from all the rest is it's 10x Optical Zoom Lens. This lens can get you up close and personal with anything your trying to capture, and the quality does not degrade, because it isn't the digital zoom. I would suggest getting a Higher Capacity SD card, 256mb is sufficient for most people (159 photos at 5mp Resolution) but if your taking a long vacation get a 512 or even a 1gb card for this camera and you won't regret it.

The 5 MP is just fine and handles an 8x10 with ease and even has the ability to be blown up larger than that w/o losing picture quality.

First of all, the preview screen has great resolution; this is not something I would think of as important, but compared to my previous 2MP camera, it is amazing how much of a difference it makes in taking a great picture to have a great preview.  Also, the 10x optical zoom is what really allows you to take close ups without the picture looking like an 80's video game!  Finally, the combined package with the printer makes actually getting the pictures OUT of the camera and onto paper (and we know we're all guilty of leaving them in there forever) so much easier.  Who would have thought that all you really wanted were some 4x6 snapshots?  Yes, we all like to have a large-size of some special pictures--and you can do that if you want to with it--but every picture does not have to be a masterpiece, so use the easy print feature with this camera and remember what it was like before digital cameras when you actually got a stack full of snapshots.

The images were amazingly sharp and the prints I made looked professional.  I hate reading owners manuals, but this camera is extremely user friendly.  My one complaint is that the batteries that come with the camera are not rechargable.  The camera is a little bulky (less than the previous model), but I bought it for the quality of photos, not to fit into my back pocket.  It is very easy to download the photos to my computer using the USB port, however I have a little trouble transferring them to the other photo program I prefer to use, but this is most likely my fault due to lack of knowledge of the programs.

Having burned through many small digitals since my first one in 2000, I am ready to buy a camera with a bit more size, a better zoom and a few more features. The price was right on this one, I liked the way it felt, it has a big lens and a burst mode for photographing my son's sports, and the controls were simple to understand and work.  There are several solid reviews from good sources for this camera, as well as a couple mediocre ones--but the camera offers so many features at such a reasonable price that I hoped the so-so reviews were from camera snobs and that we would be pleased enough.No such luck. Unfortunately, the picture quality for this camera  is often not as good as that of some of the cheap little pocket size digitals we've had previously.  Pictures taken outside seem to be quite good, but pictures in lower light when using some zoom tend to be very fuzzy. By lower light, I mean inside the house with indoor lighting in the evening--I'm not trying to take pictures in a bat cave or dark museum, just the standard pictures any of us might want to snap in our kitchen or family room.I read reviews that said a drawback of this camera was its lack of image stablization.  I thought, \"no big deal, I'm very stable when I take pictures.\"  Well, surprise, when a camera takes as long to focus in lower light as this one does (especially when using some zoom)we ALL shake.  A good percentage of indoor pictures have been blurry because of this. And even the clear ones don't seem to be \"knock your socks off\" sharp.At the time I bought this, I was also looking at a Canon A610. This camera felt so much nicer.  The Canon controls were totally inexplicable, making this Kodak look like a design marvel. Those are big pluses.  But the bottom line is, a camera needs to take clear, clean pictures and in that area, this one is not living up to expectationsADDENDUM, added later:  I've been outdoors taking pictures of a variety of plants, flowers and scenery and comparing them to the same pics taken on a decent little Nikon Coolpix. Wow, is there a difference!  Outside, this camera takes oustanding photos. I feel compelled to raise it up a star but the edit later feature doesn't let me. Give it a 4, not a 3.

Kodak color4. easy to use format5. comfortable feel6. good size screen (not great but very adequate)7. PRICE!Cons:1. Lens Cap (it has two big buttons which make it easy to remove but also is easily knocked off with the slightest pressure on even one button.2. EVF is a bit grainy3. Burst mode is a bit slow and you tend to shoot blind (CNET review) but not a huge issue unless the object you are using the burst mode for is moving at a rapid pace and in an unpredicatable  direction. Will be interesting to see if the slowness improves when I recieve my high performance SD card.4. Perhaps the biggest flaw is the lack of image stabilization.

So far, I am very satisfied with the quality of pictures that it takes, however THERE ARE DOWNSIDES.First it takes a while to boot up, not forever, but for a guy like me who is used to a quick film camera, it seems like forever.  And the power saving feature (which I do believe is mostly a good thing) requires you to restart the camera after a few minutes of not shooting. Then when it's time for a picture.. oops you have to turn it on.  This feature can be turned off, but then you waste battery life. Also the write speed seems a bit slow. Overall I think THE PROCESSOR IS A BIT SLUGGISH.  Another problem is that the screen is pretty small. You probably wouldn't notice this unless you compare it to it's more expensive counterparts.Finally, the whole Kodak EasyShare thing is really retarded. It does for your camera what AOL does to the internet.

I happened upon the Kodak Z740 on sale and bought it because of its small size, good optical zoom, and relatively high pixel count.  After using it for a few hundred pictures and a few videos, I find it to be a mix of good features and weaknesses.The good points are:1.  The camera takes good pictures, with good color, under a variety of lighting conditions.2.  The auto ISO works well with the flash so that you can get a well lit flash picture indoors even at some distance. This is important because the flash on small cameras is usually not very powerful.3.  The 10X optical zoom was very important to me to be able to reach across a room to get a closeup.4.  With a 1G SD card, you can take over 600 pictures before the card even thinks of filling up.5. Burst mode works well and it fun to use, especially since the memory card holds so many pictures.6.  The video feature is also a lot of fun and works well, and records sound pretty good.  A video does not use up excessive memory.  I found that I started using the video more and more.  A short (30 to 60 seconds) video is fun to watch and not as tedious as most home videos.7.  It's easy to access the shutter and f-stop controls in program mode.  In fact, all of the controls are easy to use, and the menu for setup is easy to understand.8.  The shape of the camera fits the hand well.  It's easy to handle and reach all the controls.The weaknesses are:1.  The camera takes too long to start up.  If you have the camera turned off and have a picture to take, you'll probably miss the shot.2.  (this is a big problem) The camera shuts down after some time that you can set in the setup, maybe three or five minutes.  It doesn't go into sleep mode - it shuts down.  What the camera should do is go into sleep mode and wake up when you press the shutter buton half way.  To wake the camera back up you have to turn it off and then turn it back on again, guaranteeing that you will miss whateve shot you want to take.  The designers were probably trying to save people from themselves by sutting off the camera after some time.  Perhaps on a future camera they'll offer an option of \"shut off\" or \"sleep\".3.  The camera is slow to focus in lower light conditions.  Again, unless you take the focus time into account, you'll miss your shot.  Focus time in good light is a bit slow but acceptable.4.  With QuickView on, the camera is slow between shots - you just can't take a few shots in quick succession, except in burst mode.  If you turn QuickView off, you get a bit faster cycle time between pictures but it's really nice to see the picture after you take it. One way to solve this problem is to show the QuickView on the LCD screen, and let the eye viewer continue to operate as a viewfinder.5.  Battery life is so-so.  The lithium ion batteries are too expensive and with rechargable batteries the time between seeing the \"low battery\" indicator and the camera not working is much too short.  You really need to have a replacement set of batteries in your pocket because the camera will stop working without much warning.The lens cap is junk - throw it away and get a netural density filter if you're worried about damaging the lens.  But digital cameras are disposable - this one will be obsolete in a few years so don't worry about damage to the lens.Some people have commented about the lack of image stabilization but I certainly have not missed it.  The imager in the camera has good sensitivity and coupled with the auto ISO the camera never seems to shoot at a slow enough sutter speed that you'd need stabilization.  Perhaps in very low light conditions, or in special situations with extreme zoom, it'd be of value.There are a few other things I'm not crazy about but they are more in the area of personal preferences so I won't list them here.  I don't use the PC software that came with the camera so I can't comment on it (I didn't install it).All-in-all, the camera is not bad, but I'd sure like one that solved some of the problems I listed above.

Of a bit more concern, if you prefer to use the viewfinder rather than composing pictures with the rear screen, as I do, and if you prefer to use your left eye, as I do, the zoom control is too close to the viewfinder to be easily accessible.  You either have take the camera away from your eye to set the zoom, or use your right eye.

It has a very nice LCD display, or you can take pictures through the traditional peep hole. On the view screen it will always tell you, which mode you are in, gives you a nice centering square, and what picture you are on, etc. The zoom on it is awesome, although I haven't used that much to date. You can take close up shots of flowers, insects, etc., and it still get everything just right. Three of my favorite features though are: the option to take video clips, and the fact that you can shoot photographs in black and white or sepia color, which gives your pictures a real antique or historical feel depending on what you are going for. It will even let play around with shooting night picturs, or different landscapes near and far.

If you're planning on taking pictures indoors under incandescent lights, you might as well find a different camera, because this one refuses to focus. The flash also washes people out unless you're standing about 8 feet away from them.I really expected a lot more from Kodak....looks like I'll be buying another Canon next time! : 0P", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "small annoyances", "Author": "Bella Luna \"misty blue\"", "ReviewID": "R1LKFQ9PPV9VPD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been happy with the quality of the pictures which has been very rewarding. I do have a couple of compaints though that I find worth sharing with others interested in this camera. The reviews I read before my purchase stated how the pop the lense cap popping off every time you turn the camera on is quite annoying which I found to be the case. There's no option to just look at your photos without the lense pushing out and the cap popping off. I have found that a camera that has an automatic lense like that uses up the battery pretty quickly. I find I need to replace the battery every 3 months with just general use of the camera. If purchasing this camera, buy the recharger along with it and a case as well.

Not great, good.First of all, I live in Washington.  I bought the camera during the summer and I took all these beautiful shots because there was great sunlight.  However once the overcast fall and winter started setting in I realized a major drawback, in low light the quality of photos drops off dramatically.Also, it's somewhat brittle.  It took an approximately one foot drop when I was in tacoma and the LCD broke, manual settings no longer functioned and I've had a lot of trouble with the lens.So in conclusion, if you are an inexperienced photographer, this is easy enough for you to pick up and take some pretty good pictures.  If you live in a cloudy area, you'll have to use flash and it doesn't pick up skin tones well at all when you use it.  I also wouldn't recommend it for a kid because one drop and look what happens.It has the basic manual settings if you're a slightly more advanced user, but with so many auto only settings if you know what you're doing at all, you'll probably be frustrated.You get what you pay for.", "Date": "January 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "My little money maker..", "Author": "Lela A.

A couple of the other reviews for this product hit the camera's cons on the head.  In order of annoyance (1 being most annoying):(1)  The focus is lousy.  It's horrendous in low light, and just plain bad in perfectly bright light.  I've found this camera has a real tendency to focus very precisely on background objects, even when you take care to make sure the green focus brackets are positioned correctly.(2)  The flash is weak in low light... except for when it is way too powerful.  I have a ton of photos where subjects' faces are awash in bright white light.  There is no controlling this, and in fact, I have taken the same shot several times in a row and experienced varying intensities of flash despite not doing anything differently.  And beware that the LCD screen will often make outdoor photos look darker than they really are (which causes you to use the flash for the next shot, which causes overexposed photos, which causes you to disable the flash... repeat, repeat, repeat).(3)  The lens cap is so awful it positively leaps off the camera.  The attachment point for the lens strap busted, too, so the lens cap falls to the ground now.  I swear, if you look at this camera the wrong way, the lens cap falls off.A solution is to shoot tons of pictures for any given scene or subject, plan on chucking about 1/2 of them due to flash or focus, and you'll be fine.

It has been droped, kicked, doused in water, had juice spilled on it and yet, much like a timex watch,it takes a licking and keeps on ticking! I am disapointed that Kodak does not seem to make a SLR Camera if they did I would invest in one! Kodak made amazing filmm so it stands to reason they make amazing cameras. I bought a fujifilm 12.2 MP to replace  my Kodak, as I THOGUHT I LOST IT! I was so disapointed in the fujifilm  brand I am  spoiled with my Kodak.  Mega pixil does not equal better, let me tell ya! I then found my Kodak and I am returning the FUjifilm and never looking back. If my Kodak ever does finally crap out on me, I will just buy another Kodak easy share z740, if they are not longer found I will up grade to its newer version.UPDATE: I bought this camera in April of 2006. It has been amazing, as i wrote. I ordered a Nikon D5000 as an intorduction to SLR cameras,I am ready to upgrade. I will continue to take pics with my Kodac easy share Z740.

I have moved on finally to a Canon XSI and while my wife and I took about 3,000 photos with this camera in 4 years, the build quality was horrible (the side door for the memory card slot is a very cheap plastic and will break off with time) and we were constantly frustrated by the extremely slow auto focus and missing out on shots.  Also the camera really struggles to take decent shots at night, you need to take several photos and have a tripod to avoid blurred images even on the night setting.

Used it many times while moving on inland boat tour to see whales and the boat was rocking big time but the photos are amazing.  The zoom is great, there are several different setting for scenery, portrait, night time, sports but they are super easy for a novice to use and get exceptional photos.  Never had a single maintenence problem with it either.  It comes with a rechargeable battery but we rarely use it preferring to use reg AA and carry lots of extras.
