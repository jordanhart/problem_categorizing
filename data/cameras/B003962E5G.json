{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So far, pretty good", "Author": "James Sabo", "ReviewID": "RUH7E95JQ02VF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I should preface this by saying that I used to be a semi-professional news photographer, so I tend to expect more from a camera than the average consumer might. I have a DSLR that I use for anything serious, but I need to have a pocket camera for those occasions where the DSLR is overkill, but the cell phone won't cut it.Bought this to replace my Pentax Optio S6. I had purchased an Optio S3 for my folks, and was impressed by the quality of the pics that such a tiny little camera could kick out. But the S6 never seemed to work quite as well as that S3-- the autofocus always seemed to fail just enough that the pic looked ok on the camera screen, but was bad when I downloaded it to the PC. I was also never that impressed with the flash for indoor pictures.So when making this purchase, I basically wanted to correct those three issues-- better autofocus, better overall image quality, and better indoor/flash images.So far, this camera is winning on all three counts. The autofocus kicks in in about half the time as the S6, and it has a focus assist light that I don't remember noticing on the Optio. In low-light situations, I'm getting reliable focus when zooming in on objects that are 10 feet away. The image stabilization seems to work very well, and it's much more obvious if a picture is out of focus or blurry than it was with the S6.The flash definitely appears to be a lot more powerful, but until I use it to take pictures in a bar at night, I can't give the final word on that.Likewise, the pictures I've taken so far appear to be pretty good-- the camera compensated for twilight conditions well on full-auto mode, although things were a bit oversaturated. The auto ISO adjustment kicked out relatively noise-free pictures even at 800, and 400 looked as good as anything I've gotten out of a point and shoot before. The real test here will be taking some outdoor pics in full daylight.One feature worth pointing out, if you're more accustomed to SLRs-- you have a dedicated exposure compensation button on the back of the camera, allowing you to make some manual adjustments to the image. The results are shown on the display in real time, so I was able to have the camera correctly focus on the ground, but expose for the sky. From what I've seen, however, you don't have the ability to adjust shutter, f-stop, or focus manually, although you can lock the camera to a specifc ISO.The video apppears to be acceptable-- I was pleasantly surprised to see that the image stabilization worked with the video, although the final result was nowhere near as sharp as I would normally expect out of HDTV resolutions. This may have been due to lighting conditions.Overall, this is a solid unit that's only a little wider than the diminutive Optio S series, while being slightly less deep. I'm impressed by what I've seen so far-- this definitely seems like the pocket camera that I needed. Small enough to not have an excuse to leave behind, powerful enough to take good shots, and at a price that doesn't break the budget.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price!", "Author": "K. Perry", "ReviewID": "R3HVY4ZQYZBR6P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first received my camera, my jaw dropped.The packaging was neatly packed inside a small box and the camera protected by a dust cover (?). I was ecstatic to know I wouldn't have to go pay $100s on batteries as this camera is rechargeable, a big plus for me! The iA (intelligent auto) is great. I never knew what mode to place my camera in for pictures to come out clear and crisp and knowing my camera can do that, another Pro! The flash is super bright. I've now decided I won't buy a camera unless it can slide down to turn on. It's also a less worry of the lens jamming as it doesn't come out. The blue was a GREAT colour choice.I highly recommend this camera to those not looking to spend a lot, and still want professional looking pictures!", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "A great little camera for the price", "Author": "V. C. Wald", "ReviewID": "R1OYXKBNWZ0WM8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a long-time film, and now digital, SLR user who needed something better than the (very low quality) camera in my Droid to carry around from day to day. This little Panasonic Lumix is slim, lightweight, and has a thoughtfully designed slide cover over the lens and flash that turns the camera on when opened and protects delicate parts well when closed. It's a no-brainer to use, although I've only had it for a few days and have not tried to explore features beyond the obvious. For instance, I have not used the digital zoom (which is invariably disappointing even in far more expensive cameras anyway).I took it around Lincoln Square in Chicago yesterday and it passed several challenges. In particular, I used it indoors without flash, and I was very impressed. Some images had to be brightened a bit (nb, I use PhotoShop, I have not tried the software supplied with it) to bring out details and contrast, but I have to do the same thing with photos off my Nikon SLR in similar conditions, it's par for the course. What is good about the camera is that it is smart enough to compensate for low light and record details, even if a little tweaking is required to see them on the photo. Being used to having a view finder and being able to brace a camera against me when I shoot, I have to concentrate hard to hold it still out in front of my face (no view finder on this little dude), but I didn't end up with any blurry photos from my own movement, suggesting that the image stabilization is working.I fiddled with macro mode a bit and was very happy with the sharpness of the results as well.If you're used to an SLR or a more sophisticated digital camera, you'll have to cut this little camera some slack, but you'll find it umpteen times better than your camera phone.

Matthews \"goldaegis\"", "ReviewID": "REEQBE9NJPUYF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Lumix DMC-FP1 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x zoom almost immediately replaced my Lumix DMC-FH20 14.1 MP 8x. The loss of double the zoom and the 2 MegaPixles was more than made up by ending frequent lens jam and retraction problems with the DMC-FH20.After getting rid of the DMC-FH20 I find the DMC-FP1 not only a suitable but an excellent replacement with both models using the same slim battery. In the DMC-FP1 it lasts more than +400 pictures (I rarely use flash) on a full charge. I don't know how long a full charge would last with the DMC-FH20, I didn't keep it long enough to find out once the lens jam and retraction problems began. On the subject of the Panasonic DMW-BCF10PP Battery, most after-market non-manufacturer made batteries will NOT work with either camera. These cameras \"know\" when a substitute is inserted.The DMC-FP1 aluminum frame and sliding lens cover (maybe entirely aluminum body) protect the camera in either a man's front pocket or a woman's small purse. This is an excellent take everywhere camera with 24 hour capability to provide up to 8x10 prints ( well, 5x7 almost always). After more than three months, it's my constant companion.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Bustin' Out the Blue Thang", "Author": "N. Isabella", "ReviewID": "R3U7QFSFKDNW08", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The two main reasons I purchased this camera is because of its zoom capabilities, and that the lens doesn't jut out of the camera when you turn it on like most models (this is the part that always seems to break). You slide the lens cover down and you're good to go. No moving parts.Images are sharp -- even with digital zoom. Though they tend to be a little grainy in low light without flash.Battery life is excellent. You can fill up a 2 gig card and still have juice left if you're not using the flash for every photo.There are plenty of options -- both manual overrides for ISO and white balance and whatnot, and presets for night shots, the beach, portraits...Shutter speed is fast with no annoying lag-time.The 720p video is awesome.My only complaint is that the instruction manual is worthless to anyone who can figure out how to insert a battery and press a shutter button. There're are a lot of little options and settings that are just not covered. And you'll be left frustrated until you catch the little disclaimer in 8-point sized font, beneath all the boilerplate in the silly \"manual,\" that full instructions are in a pdf file on the CD that the camera comes with. The CD also comes complete with a photo editing program that will crash and brick up your computer if you dare to install it.That said, I'd recommend this camera to the casual photographer who wants quality photos without shelling out more than $150.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little Camera for Online Store Owners.", "Author": "Akasha R.

I did read the reviews on this camera from several sources, and decided I couldn't go wrong for the price.  I REALLY needed a good Macro feature as I take pics of my small jewelry for my Online store that captured the details.  It was perfect for my needs.  It takes great Macro pics.  It's very easy to use for those of you who feel, as I do, uncomfortable with figuring out camera features.  It's very easy to use.  I have also used it to take pics outside, and at family gatherings and have always gotten great results.  You can also purchase a rechargeable battery...DO IT! I'm glad I did! I highly recommend this to those of you who have Online Stores and need a camera for that purpose.
