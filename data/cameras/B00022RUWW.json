I used it to catch someone breaking into my car back in 2004 in a home-made set up.  Although the video is B/W (because it was dark and the car is all grey/black inside) and it's YouTube video (highly compressed).When enough light is available it displays in color, but automatically switches to black'n'white mode when it gets dark.  I picked this camera because it had the best lux rating for its size, meaning it sees very well in the dark.  It's not perfect and needs some light, but I haven't seen anything better to date.It was originally captured at 640x480 and looks very crisp.  The police said it was the best security video they'd ever seen-- much better than anything they get from store robberies, etc.  You can also see a cleaner 320x240 video, although edited for fun, at [...]I now have the same camera sitting outside so I can see my driveway.  It's been working non-stop for 2 years in hot and cold weather.", "Date": "June 9, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$509.95", "Features": "0.33-inch color Sony HAD CCD image sensor\nWeatherproof bullet housing is incredibly small, allowing camera placement almost anywhere\nHorizontal resolution of 470 TV lines with 50dB or better S/N ratio\nMinimum illumination of 0.03 lux for low-light viewing\nRuns on regulated 12-volt DC power supply", "Name": "Speco Technologies Miniature Weather-Proof Color Bullet Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JaEu-TSML._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00022RUWW"}}
