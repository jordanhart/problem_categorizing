Almost useless.Macro: Ok, for the price, decent results but don't expect to capture bugs detailsUV filter: Very goodCloth: ExcellentAveragely a low level product, affordable for the price. If you are looking for satisfying results, save the money for other (pricey) lenses.

It gives my shots a round shape screen view instead of a normal view. Just be aware of the round screen shape if you are using it to take the best wide angle shot.
