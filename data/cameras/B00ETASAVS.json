{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice features!", "Author": "INDALU", "ReviewID": "R3M8Z7LRZ62REK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is Canon's new and improved Power Shot model.  I bought it to replace an older lower megapixel version.  The picture quality is excellent.  And the zoom is unbelievably great. Picture quality at max zoom is very good.  It has a billion features. I will probably never use some (including the WiFi) but it's great technology. Love being able to Edit on the camera and add effects. Good in low light. Macros are great. My only slight negative is the physical size.  It is smaller than I expected.  I have short stubby fingers and it is a little hard for me to grip, but otherwise I'm really happy with the purchase.  Snap this up....was $249 a few weeks ago and now already up to $269.  The bundle which includes a 32 memory card and extra battery is well worth the money.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$248.00", "Features": "12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor\nCanon DIGIC 4 Image Processor\n1080p Full HD video\n30x Optical Zoom and 24mm Wide-Angle lens\nOptical Image Stabilizer", "Name": "Canon PowerShot SX510 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 30x Optical Zoom and 1080p Full-HD Video Super Bundle With 32GB Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) Memory Card, Digpro Compact Camera Deluxe Carrying Case, Extra Battery , Tripod , Card Reader, Wa", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4195mEMAfEL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00ETASAVS"}}
