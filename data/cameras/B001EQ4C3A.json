{"Reviews": [{"Title": "excellent little camera", "Author": "Hot Damn", "ReviewID": "R3BKS24XGQA6JL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a few days, and already I love it. The points that have charmed me so far:1- very low shutter lag. you can take a picture quickly, and capture exactly the scene you want (not the scene 2 to 5 seconds after you point your camera).2- takes standard AA rechargeable batteries. also, you can turn off the LCD and use the old school view finder to save battery power in a pinch.3- the 'print' button is programmable, so you can use it for a variety of other functions (useful to me because I almost never plug my camera directly into a printer).4- the whole design of the camera is intuitive and easy to use.The only less-than-stellar aspect of this camera is its size. It's not bulky, but there are much tinier cameras in this class on the market. I wasn't quite prepared to remove a star for that, though, as a reduction in size would likely mean an increase in price. I think the trade-off is fine.Overall, I highly recommend this camera for point-and-shoot purposes. It's easily my favorite of the ~5 digital cameras I've owned over the years.", "Date": "December 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "The Canon Powershot E1 is AMAZING!", "Author": "Brandy Donelson \"Brandy D\"", "ReviewID": "R1W2F1URI9209U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just needed a camera for fun..and I have had a Canon before.  I didn't like that my old one had a rechargeable battery that didn't last long so I am really happy to find one like my old one that is a million times better in quality and it takes real batteries that LAST!!  I LOVE IT!! Takes great pictures and it's super easy to use...comparing it to my old one (which was an Elph), it takes much faster pictures although you do have to hold the shutter button down to take a picture which is annoying to have to tell other people using it.

I've been using the Canon PowerShot SD400 Elph 5mp 3x Zoom for the past few years and have really enjoyed it; however, this new camera blows it out of the water!Besides falling in love with the look and style of the E1 (it's the most beautiful shade of robin's egg blue I've ever seen), the pictures I've taken are incredible both in detail and clarity.  And I'm equally impressed how close you can get to your subject with the zoom.  I was going to get one of those Flip camcorders but the Movie Mode on this is perfect for capturing quick clips.The functions are all quite simple to use, you really don't even have to read the manual.  It also has an \"Easy\" mode, excellent for anyone who might be intimidated by cameras.  I feel this would be a perfect camera for both ends of the spectrum, from the novice to the more experienced.  I'm in love with it!

I used the Canon comparison to compare the A1000 and E-1 and found them to be the same camera except for cosmetic differences.  I bought several E-1 cameras as Christmas gifts for women in my family.  It is small, easy to use, has both an LCD viewer and a view finder so that the sun and other bright lights do not overwhelm the LCD viewer.  A novice user can put it on Easy mode and do quite well, leaving only the composition of the photograph as a challenge.  I set my wife's camera and that of her sister on Automatic.  Frankly, Automatic is a little better in program selection and is just as easy to use as is Easy mode.  For more challenging photographs, you can select Portrait, and other Scene modes so it is versatile.  It is small enough that I can carry it in a jacket pocket and I used one at the Tulsa State Fair 2008 so I had a ready camera with good capability without carrying a lot of weight.  Arthritis has helped me to decide on items of less weight and bulk.  The photographs I took of KOTV Channel Six personnel using the Portrait Mode turned out excellent and yes, I worked them in Photoshop CS4 but I had good sizes to begin with.  The image size is 10MP so it is adequate for most prints for those who would tend to buy this camera.  It is pretty as well as functional and its availability in several colors lets you buy it for family members without young women thinking you got everyone the same thing.  Overall, it is an excellent choice.Stephen", "Date": "January 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Deal", "Author": "Tammy Willis", "ReviewID": "R1ZV4BWWZTC1AE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this camera about a month ago, and couldn't be more pleased with it!

You aren't going to always get professional SLR quality images, but that's not what this camera is.  (Also, you can get better battery life if you get a set of re-chargeable NiMH batteries instead of using regular alkaline AAs.)The video clips are surprisingly sharp and clear on this camera, rivaling those on the Canon SD1200.  I took some indoor family photos at Christmas, and this camera's photos were actually somewhat sharper than the very same images taken with a Sony DSC-H20, which has bad indoor noise.The camera has easy to use features and buttons and a sturdy build.  I like that it has a rounded grip on the right side.  I also like the easy access ISO button.One bad thing was that I took some of my photos using an indoor scene mode, because in the LCD screen they looked so nice and warm.  However, after viewing them on a computer in Photoshop, those photos were actually too orange.  So don't be deceived by what you see on the screen, apparently the color there is not totally accurate.  I should have just taken the photos in Auto mode.I love the cool design and colors of this camera.  I bought the white one because it reminded me of my Electra Rosie bike.  So I stuck one of my little red rose stickers that came with my bike on the camera, and now they match!  Not that I'll be using my camera while I ride the bike, but still.

I got this as a package deal with the cables, case, rechargeable batteries, a tiny tripod (which is worthless) and a large SD card.  I've had a lot of people say I got a great deal, so keep searching on Amazon until you find it.  I found the package deal totally by accident when I lost my data and had to \"re-search\" cameras.

However ... Canon is one of the few that offers some features others don't.  First and foremost is a VIEWFINDER.  While it may not seem like a big deal ... a viewfinder is critical when shooting outdoors in bright sunlight.  (Ever tried looking at an LCD screen when the sun is at your back?)  Another feature I prefer is that this camera operates on two double A batteries which are available almost everywhere.  If you prefer rechargeable batteries, they are also available but double A's are a nice option when your rechargeables run out of juice.  Lastly, I find the Canon controls to be simple and intuitive for most users.  The large LCD screen is very crisp and the ergonomics very good with a \"grip\" molded into the sleek body.

Its such a doggone cute camera, its very depressing!I wanted to create a cute Hello Kitty-like startup screen for my wife, but everyone should ALSO be aware of this fact that is true for ALL canon cameras: you cannot save an altered image or self created image back to the camera, software will not allow you to, nor will saving it directly to a memory card! The camera will NOT read it.Also if you were thinking of creating your own custom sounds for the camera (or ANY canon camera) forget it, their software won't allow you to load it to the camera.One way Canon COULD solve the missing purple tab issue with the E1, would be to simply provide a firmware update.
