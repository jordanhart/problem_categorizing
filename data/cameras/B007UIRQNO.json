{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good stuff", "Author": "shaun", "ReviewID": "RQF614VEJHO9J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received this kit with a discount and so it was well worth it when I bought my Cannon Eos Rebel T3i  http://amzn.to/L9E0PV  I really like the little desk top tripod. The kit is well thought out. I keep most of it in a backpack I turned into a gear bag. The lens cleaner and extra battery I keep in the camera bag which lives in the gear bag.Pros:1. The extra battery is a Must have!!! I use my camera for a lot of video and recording at full 1920x1080 can use up a battery.2.Having a portable car charger is freaking sweet. swap out the dead one, and put in on the charger while you get back to having fun.3. The SD card reader came in very handy the other day( nephew's Laptop) , and worked great.Cons:1. The \" Leans Wiper\" is a unsented dryer sheet. :-(  It works fine,nut I would have liked to get a microfiber cloth.2. The Tripod is made of Very thin aluminum. it works fine I added a little 3-1 oil and things smooth right up. It is good for work on the desk top and is nice because you can collapse it down to fit in a backpack. But if i wanted i could bends it in half with little effort. Not rugged, I use it more for the DXG- A85V  http://amzn.to/1j1ngWV since it is a bit lighter.3. The cleaning kit included a pack of Five (5) \" Q-tips. Thanks....I keep them and the dryer sheet in the camera bag.Overall not a bad kit and good for anyone just starting out, but you will want to upgrade the tripod asap.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$38.73", "Features": "LP-E8 Rechargeable Lithium Ion Replacement 1500 mAh Battery + External Rapid Quick-Charger with Car Charger Attachment\n6 Foot High Performance Mini HDMI Cable\nFull Size 50\" Tripod W/Carry Bag\nUSB SD Memory Card Reader + Memory Card Wallet\nMini Table Top Tripod + Pack of LCD Screen Protectors + Lens/LCD Maintenance Cleaning Kit", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera (600D / Kiss x5) LP-E8 Lithium Ion Replacement Battery 1500 mAh w/External Rapid Charger + Tripod + Mini HDMI + USB SD Memory Card Reader /Wallet + Deluxe Starter Kit Bundle DavisMAX LPE8 Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5167n2iWENL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007UIRQNO"}}
