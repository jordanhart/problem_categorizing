Mindock \"stargazer\"", "ReviewID": "R3KALTA9FV34WD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is built like a tank.Turns on and is up and running about as quick you'll ever need. Turning off the boot up image in settings helps.It focuses very quickly.Many options are available. Be ready to spend a week, to master them all. Camera isa lot of fun to use. The more time you spend reading the manual, on the CD, the more you'll be impressed with it. It even has a built-in level and in-camera HDR. Lots of other goodies as well.Picture quality is better than I have ever seen from a point & shoot. It can shoot in RAW mode,Shoots photos in fairly dark rooms without the flash. My top of the line Elph always had trouble but not the G15. The lens istop notch, very fast.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing point and shoot for photography enthusiasts", "Author": "Richie Deschamps", "ReviewID": "R3FQSC8KWODULF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're a photography enthusiast, and you're looking for a solid point and shoot camera to carry around when you don't want to lug a ton of equipment on your back, this is the camera to buy. I don't think there is a point and shoot in this price range that has a lens this fast, particularly one that maintains a f/2.8 while zoomed to its maximum focal range. A lot of reviews compare this camera with Sony's RX100 -- a camera that arguably has a better sensor -- but even that camera has a minimum aperture of 4.0 when zoomed to its maximum focal range.I primarily shoot in low light situations, concert photography to be specific, so it's important that I'm able to get good results with fast moving objects in dim lighting environments. I tested this out last night at a show where the only lights were coming from a projectionist who was projecting onto a band. Amazingly, I was able to get great shots that rival some DSLR bodies I've owned in the past. Still no match for what I get with my Sony a65, but certainly impressive considering that this is a point and shoot! Even at an ISO of 1600, there is little noticeable noise and great bokeh behind your subjects.I haven't seen it mentioned in many reviews, but the video feature is also very impressive for a point and shoot. While I've noticed other reviews say that it is \"limited\" to 24 frames per second while in 1080p mode (if you shoot at 720p, it shoots at 30 fps), I literally NEVER shoot video UNLESS it's at a frame rate of 24 fps. It gives your video a very cinematic feel, and people tend to perceive video shot this way to look more professional. However, you can't control shutter speed, ISO, focus or aperture while shooting video, something that I can't help but wonder why not... maybe a firmware update is in the works. If that's the case, I could see this camera becoming a DSLR alternative for video enthusiasts.Although you're not going to achieve the same results with this camera as you would with a good DSLR, this little camera is a great addition to my collection, and I'm very happy with the results I've achieved so far. Highly recommend!", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "SLR substitute", "Author": "Slamron", "ReviewID": "R2EIC0MAGGOGOQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a Nikon D600 with a tele and a 50mm lens. With the bag it ways almost 4 lbs, way too much to haul it around during sight seeing. I bought the G15 because of its fast lense, reasonable zoom range, some of the manual settings posibilities and its fairly light weight. The pros: light weight, very good pictures in low light conditions, good white balance, reasonable distortion. The cons: it is borderline portable in my trouser pocket, the flash opens up only manually, the optical tunnel view finder is only approximate but useful in bright light. Manual settings not as easy and extensive as on my D600.Overall, it is the best point and shoot camera I ever owned.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera--good bundle.", "Author": "windbreaker", "ReviewID": "R128A1HZVOGD7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this G15 to have a good quality camera that has a fast lens and a lot of flexibility that I can take on hikes and runs in the local forests.

It has a good zoom range and the shoe for auxiliary flash is a nice bonus. If you're looking to replace an older camera, or buying this as a first camera for yourself or someone else, you wont be disappointed. It's built really well and has a few features that you wont find on other point and shoots.However, I ended up returning it as it just wasn't what I was looking for. I currently own a Canon Powershot ELPH, and a Rebel T3i. We love our t3i which is an awesome camera that takes amazing photos. The only problem is that it's too big to carry around as an everyday camera so we've missed out on capturing special moments and memories because we didn't want to lug the extra bag worth of equipment. We have the ELPH for that, but after seeing the difference in photo quality, its just hard to get excited about using it. I was hoping the G15 would narrow the gap between size/convenience and photo quality, but ended up being disappointed. The G15 took some nice photos in the time we tested it, but only a handful that were noticeably better than what the ELPH would have produced. And while it's small enough to fit in a large purse or backpack, it's still too big to fit in a jeans pocket or smaller purse(which is what my wife prefers). For the price it just didn't live up to what we expected, and if you're looking for a convenient point and shoot, I think your money would be better spent on something like the S110 or even the ELPH 330 (the upgraded version of what we own).", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Diggin it!", "Author": "Wendie Thompson", "ReviewID": "R3UEU8O2AB9H3A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am loving everything about this camera!

Still a \"pocket\" camera but easier to manage than others I have owned due to to thickness and surface texture.  While not a DSLR, it sure beats the bulk and weight and suits my needs.

Miller \"music lover\"", "ReviewID": "R3NP48XR1LPATB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For a while now, I've been wanting a compact digital that would shoot RAW, one to use for times when my DSLR is too cumbersome to lug around.  The G15 is a great solution.  It does indeed shoot RAW if you want that (but you can shoot three grades of JPEG, also), but it does a whole lot more, as well.  It's the next best thing to a DSLR.  In fact, it does things my 6-year-old DSLR does not, employing a number of advances in digital photography that have occurred over that interim.  For example, it shoots five aspect ratios, where my DSLR shoots only two.  It doesn't exactly replace a DSLR, but it's a very nice alternative for times when you don't want to carry a big camera.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "CANON POWERSHOT G15 12 MP DIGITAL CAMERA", "Author": "ROBERT E.

We are not let down.  This camera is simply the best in its class.  It is so easy to use and is capable of so much.  I did have to spend some time with the manual for the more complex shots I wanted to do, but after reading the easy to understand instructions, I had my custom light balance programed into one of the selections on the top dial (C1 and C2 are fully customizable settings- love this feature!) and now I just set the camera to that everytime we do a shoot under those conditions.When we looked at the cameras in person, many of the competitors cameras felt cheap and one more expensive camera had 3/4 of its monitor fried.  The sales person said it was a display model and they get abused, but we felt that was not a good sign, we want something that can handle travel.  This Canon definitely can take a lot.We love it.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot G15 12MP", "Author": "GLD", "ReviewID": "R5JX0BNIFRT3X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had the camera for several months and I'm still learning to use it fully.
