{"Reviews": [{"Title": "May be the best point and shoot on the market!", "Author": "R. Voorhees", "ReviewID": "R1XXZQ2P2ECE4L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I couldn't wait to get my hands on one of these, so I picked one up at the local BB, and I have to say, the wait was worth it. This is probably as close to a DSLR as you can get while still keeping the ease of a pocket sized point and shoot. It's laden with features, such as object tracking (think golf swing analysis!), lock in auto focus, which is great for movies...oh, and speaking of movies, it shoots full 1080p at 60p, and the image stabilization is incredibly efficient, even at the full 20x optical zoom. Smooth, smooth video on par with a GoPro without the fish eye effect.The sensor is amazing. extremely low light with no noise, and super crisp pictures...ALMOST on par with the NEX 5T. I generally give a camera the \"jeans\" test, where I shoot a close up of denim fabric, then blow it up to fullest magnification and look at the detail level. The detail level looks like a microscope...exactly what I look for.The LED display is fairly intuitive, is bright and crisp, so you get an excellent idea of how your pictures will look when printed. My only complaint is that I'm used to a touch screen, which this doesn't have. Some people like that, some people don't. I would have preferred one as it makes navigating so much easier, but again, the point is quality photos and video. I'll throw a couple shots up so you can see for yourself.I won't say this is a steal at $299.00, but in this case, you DO get what you pay for.Great, great camera!", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Pocket Point & Shoot - Big Improvement Over WX300", "Author": "FiveForm \"FiveForm\"", "ReviewID": "RO7XPPQ9NBQ9I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A year ago I purchased the predecessor to this camera, the WX300.  I had mixed feelings about it since I loved the long optical zoom, size and Wifi capabilities;  however due to the extreme over-processing of the JPEG images from the tiny 1/2.3\" sensor I wasn't pleased with the overly smoothed \"painted\" look, over noise corrected images (particularly when viewed at 100% on my monitor), so I returned it to my local BB.Now, when this current edition WX350 came out and I was able to see it and handle it a bit at the local store I was skeptical that it wouldn't be appreciably different than its predecessor.  But, since the images tried in the store looked good I took a chance and bought it at a very good price (comparable to Amazon's).  I've been taking some test shots over the course of the last week, and also decided to take it to a kids' soccer game this weekend and shot it alongside my Nikon D7000 DSLR with 18-200mm lens.  Looking at the results, side-by-side in Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5.4, I was highly impressed!  Not only did this little P&S; nail the focus in a fast moving sports activity at least 95% of the time, but the look of the JPEG files at 100% was much better than I had expected.  At auto ISO captures between 80~800 there was minimal over sharpening and noise reduction, colors were bright and saturated (a tad bit more than my taste), and all were worthy of either larger size web presentation or printing up to 8x10 (maybe even 11x14) right out of the camera.  The few videos I took also exhibited great focus tracking on the fly and the HD quality and sound were very nice.  I'm still playing with settings and seem to prefer the regular auto over the \"Intelligent Auto\" feature.  I don't use the scene setting much since the basic auto setting actually selects these \"automagically.\"In the end, I had more off-focus images from the Nikon DSLR (set at auto focus point select and auto tracking) than on this minuscule Sony P&S;!  I was shooting JPEGS (the only option) out of the WX350, and RAW images (later tweaked in Lightroom) out of the D7000. Needless to say, as a former professional photographer (now just having fun as a hobby), I feel that Sony has really delivered on this camera at an amazing price point with a quality build, to boot!  I also don't really see the need for most users to go to Sony's flagship point and shoot cameras like the RX100 or RX100 MKII.  Those do have the  1\" class sensor for less high ISO noise, but the new BIONZ X image processing (same as used in Sony's new full frame a7 full frame series cameras) makes the significant improvement in the WX350 over the WX300.  Since most of the other specs in this camera didn't change over the WX300 I'm guessing that the improved image processing has to be the result of the upgrade in image processing engine.You will find this camera hard to beat at the mid-two hundred dollar price range, and it should drop even further over the next 6 months.  For the casual shooter, amateur, or pro the WX350 is an excellent primary P&S; or pocket back-up.  Very quick into action with fast zoom, great video and fast focus it is now with me most of the time and is far faster to get into action than my cell phone camera. Speaking of that, having an Android phone with NFC, it's really cool to be able to pull up an image on the WX350 and tap it to my phone to copy the shot.  Controlling the camera from my phone works great, too, although I don't know how often I would personally use this feature - perhaps for candids of kids or wildlife, or such.  Oh yes, the battery life also is great, as well (good thing since you will need to charge the battery in the camera, tying it up (one downside, but you pay less for the absence of a dedicated charger).Finally, I have to say that I would buy the Sony DSC-WX350 again with no hesitation for a \"carry it everywhere, all the time\" camera that you can have confidence will provide the shots you need when you need them for much enjoyment....", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great replacement for phone photo addiction", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RS114SEL4RZYX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very happy with this. Indoors with flash the colors are not always true but it's pretty darn sweet and so many other ways. I've been looking for a camera to replace my cell phone.  I was looking for something truly tiny that I could keep with me; something that, though menu driven, would give me more photographic control. I shoot both a Nikon DSLR and the Sony Nex 7 but I found that I was addicted to using my cell phone on a day to day basis because of the size and ease of uploading images to FB. I started out with a Sony Nex 3n which is an excellent camera with a full size APS sensor, and it did ride in my purse nicely in the fake leather cover. But, when I saw this one I determined that it would be even better...plus I got rid of the Fuji SX I was keeping around for the 675mm reach( It was heavier than my DSLR).It starts up fast! I like to turn it on and see how fast I can get a shoot. The lens can be fully extended to reach 500mm and the focus is fast. The wifi transfer was quick and easy. I'm used to using Sony cameras so there was not learning curve.My main hesitation was the size of the sensor. But, compared to a phone with 8mp and a really tiny sensor, the image quality is amazing.This camera also makes sense because I am never going to get out to 500mm with a Nikon lens on my camera; can't afford it.I purchased the genuine leather case for this directly from Sony. Free shipping and 15% off when you register you're camera. That way I feel comfortable throwing the camera in my purse or sticking it in a pocket. Plus it is so classy in the case.

We have rarely been disappointed. The Sony DSC-WX350 is a very small camera which is capable of producing excellent image quality in both still and video modes.It is capable of recording video in true 1080  60 P quality.The camera appears to have a very high build quality.The supplied documentation is very poor, and it is very easy to confuse the input areas for USB and Power. There is a very detailed manual available online, but we think a camera of this cost should have some kind of users manual included in the box.We found the image quality (especially when set to the highest settings) to be generally excellent, and the same can be said of the video. If you want to record/transfer in the highest video quality settings (1080 60 P) you need a very high quality SDHC card, as the video transfer rate is 28 MBPS.The following criticism is partially due to our age and declining vision. If you have excellent vision, you can probably ignore this portion of the review.We found the camera controls and buttons to be very small, hard to differentiate/discern, and the controlling actions themselves to be somewhat confusing. There is no touch screen control at all, and selections are made by various controlling buttons. This made the camera difficult to set up, use and control.  You will find yourself frequently double checking which control your fingers are accessing.One interesting feature is the ability to change the aspect ratio of the still images.All in all, this is a very small camera with a big performance capability.Touch screen control would make this camera rate 5+!", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "two thumbs up", "Author": "chuck", "ReviewID": "R3UCUI93PX0E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "best bang for the buck considering what the camera is and does. can get pro quality pics for cheap. easy to use as well.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "VERY NICE, but worth a WX300 Upgrade ????", "Author": "Bears Fan Jim \"qm2-703\"", "ReviewID": "R3AGQ56A1556D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I own the WX300 and did not see any substantial improvement in the 350 so returned it.

I'm an owner of a NEX 5N and looking at the new A6000, but I am still impressed by the pictures and video of this tiny box. At current prices, the WX300 ($199) and WX350 ($249) are both GREAT BUYS. Personally, I bought the WX300 at $229, and am unwilling to take a loss in order to make , in my own experience,  a small upgrade to the WX350.Had the WX350 added flash compensation, this would have been a tougher decision, for that is a serious weakness to both these otherwise very usable travel cams.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Used the wifi at a sports event", "Author": "Sally A.

In the past it required hitting the button slightly before the horse started to jump and I could never get it right.I set up wifi with my Samsung smart phone and the app \"PlayMemories Mobile.\" It wasn't hard to figure out.

It works great outdoors and the 1080p/60fps video is very nice. However, almost every shot I have taken indoors has been ruined by the flash washing out the picture.  It is very strong and there is no real way to control it. You can control it to a certain point by using the exposure compensation feature, but what it really needs, and is missing, is flash compensation.  My RX100 has that feature and it is a shame that the WX350 does not have it.

The Sony DSC-WX350 creates videos in the MTS format, which requires 3rd party software to convert to AVI, MP4 or WMV so that the video can be played on a computer with standard media players.Sony does not provide computer software for playback or conversion of the video.So far, the 3rd party converters I have tried lost a great deal of the video quality on conversion (compared to the playback on the camera LCD Screen) or produced converted video with the video and audio tracks out of sink.As a digital camera, I would rate the Sony as good; as a video cam...well, I am not so sure about that yet.", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best point and shoot!", "Author": "Stephanie", "ReviewID": "R29HQBA3EE3M5Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fabulous camera!

I also took photos outside and was not disappointed.We were being filmed for a commercial for the university. The camera could not be in the shot, so one of the camera guys took it to hold.

It is true that the manual is online, however it does not take much to understand the camera. Just play with it before needing it.

The Canon took gorgeous pictures but I wasn't too happy with the low light quality so I bought this Sony thinking the superior sensor would do the trick.Well, this camera does perform better in low light and it's a more pocketable camera but that's where the similarities end.The photo quality in daylight was disappointing. They were not as true-to-life as the Canon.  Futhermore, the menu system is maddening.  It takes many presses of very tiny buttons (and God help you if you have big fingers) to change anything, even exposure compensation.  After 2 days of use I still struggled. And that's after reading almost every page of the awful web-based manual (the PDF is even worse, and there's no paper manual).Video was not better either.  Though it shoots at 1080p, if you freeze a frame it obviously looks grainy and not tack-sharp, even in daylight.  So you're getting basically 720p quality or worse, while wasting 1080p memory.  I must say I was REALLY impressed with their 5-axis image stabilization.  I mounted the camera on my car dashboard and drove around town.  Couldn't believe how steady the video was even while the car bounced around.  I have shaky hands and I must say this camera stabilizes better than any other compact I've tried.I'm hoping Sony releases the HX60V in the US.  It's currently only available outside the US. That will combine more manual functions with better video quality.  At least that is my hope.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sony DSC-WX350/B - TOTALLY AWESOME!

PRO, WIN 8.1 PRO COMPATIBLE - NO ISSUES AT ALL WITH THIS SONY - HOWEVER WITH MOVIES YOU WOULD NEED TO EITHER MOVE IT TO MP4 OR MPEG IF YOU ARE GOING TO UPLOAD VIDEOS ONLINE FOR YOUR INFORMATION!I wished I had looked on Amazon before going to the Brick and Mortar Store first I would have saved some money here - but either way this Sony Cybershot DSC-WX350/B is one heck of an amazing Camera! With 20x  Digital Zoom up to 40x Optical Zoom; 3.0\" LCD  @ 460k dots) even though it is only 18.2 MP - this is one heck of a computerized Digital Sony Cybershot with many built-in features to even special effects; it comes with \"Sony Silver X\" Battery, USB cable both for recharging and to upload to computer, unfortunately the case is sold separately; but I already have the old Sony Camera Cybershot Case.  Purchased a 64 GB Transcends SDHC-Pro Micro-card because this camera has the capability to handle HDMI! You can configure this settings very easily - so if you want to do a movie; you can and with this 64 SDHC-Pro GB makes it perfect for Movies and Photography, including the Panoramic, Landscaping and so much more. The biggest feature of them all; what was lacking what people missed the most in the old original Sony Cybershot Cameras - THEY ARE BACK plus MORE!  Take your time to get to know your camera and the settings there. While the only down side is - it is plastic but very durable plastic, not an \"El cheapo\" plastic; (but in my heart - would rather have it metal like the \"Good Old Days\").  One unique awesomeness is, you can save your battery life too; sometimes \"WE FORGET\" due to excitement that surrounds us that the camera is still \"ON\", I recommend that you configure it to automatically shut itself off; for turning it back on is relatively easy and a SNAP!How does the images turn out? AWESOME! You can adjust the features yourself or have the Sony Cybershot camera do it for you even in very low light. In addition, the sound is with good clarity with movies and sound for HDMI.  Yes, I am still learning my \"NEW TOY\" here since the one I am so used to, so much has changed over the years that it is surreal!++++++++++++++++++++++++++VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS SONY DSC-WX350/B:Just make sure you take the TIME to go to the SONY Website as listed on the BOX it came with, and REGISTER YOUR CAMERA; for every time you connect it whether by USB or Wi-Fi; any FIRMWARE UPDATES will be automatically detected.  In addition, this camera comes with many settings, so please take your time to configure your camera in the settings; for there is so much but not all settings \"ARE CREATED EQUAL\" so to speak. For every setting is different and unique in it's own right - hence why I have not only included the photo but also two differing Photo Images from two differing settings ...  I would have loved to include the Panoramic Shot but it is unfortunate Amazon doesn't allow this type of \"image\" as much as it is being beautiful as is. There is far more to your advantage, in order for this camera to work, unless you already understand the Techie Stuff; it pays to have that Sony PDF file which is the Manual - because the default settings such as Flash being \"auto\" which does not give you the change to turn off the flash; you have to configure it all and the PDF manual guides you everything from ISO to Program to Intelligent to multiple other features and plus the reason WHY some options are which I would best sum it up as \"grayed out\" because it is not available for this specific camera mode; in addition as how to use the x20 and the x40 plus the Macro - there is much LEARNING to use in this powerful camera, so what you don't know can result some options there. While yes, it does have a built-in tips and tricks in there but that is very limited and only if you have it enabled (I must add having this enabled actually will drain your battery resources if you already know how to use this Sony Camera - turn it off in the camera Settings).  Plus for the SERIOUS Photographers, there is a DSLR Color Meter mode that you can enable on specific or all for precision perfection, but usage of this will drain your battery so having a back up battery will be helpful here if you use this type of Meter Mode to get Professional Results. There are more functions and other features there including Cropping to Beauty Effects plus adding or disabling date (my Photo added to this shows this option, one enabled and one disabled). Yes, I have seen the manual but no, I have not read it *blush* because I pretty much know Sony Cameras very well since I first have (still own it) their first digital camera.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ALREADY ORDERED UP ANOTHER BACKUP BATTERY AND A SEPARATE RECHARGER (even though it comes with a recharger - it's just that I don't want to wreck up the USB Sony Cable by too much plugging and unplugging; I may just revert to using the longer USB (not available on Amazon) cable which has the Micro-USB port for the Sony; for the cable that comes with it is short).Sony NP-BX1/M8 Lithium-Ion X Type Battery (Silver)andSony BCTRX  Battery Charger for X/G/N/D/T/R and K Series Batteries (Black)Words cannot express the AWESOMENESS OF THIS CAMERA - the only sad part is, I am not used to plastic type cameras, because everything I have owned is literally METAL and HEAVY Type Photography Equipment - but this one will BLOW YOUR MIND as what's all in there and then more ... WORTH EVERY PENNY OF YOUR MONEY; AN INVESTMENT WELL SPENT!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~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nderwater Waterproof case for Sony Cybershot DSC W150,170,200,300This will work for SONY DSC-WX350 and WX350/B Series ... I am not brave enough to try this one. So if someone else is - go ahead and try it and post your results and photos and even provide an update about underwater Photos!  There is a function available for such in the WX-350/B Model... as well as W and WX 300 Model (They will all fit into this underwater case) ...If you plan on hitting on snorkeling - I am not sure of how deep one can go underwater with this camera but I am pretty sure there is a depth or fathom limitations / restrictions as how deep under water one can go; so if you're hitting up on the Caribbean to Keys to Cave Diving or Hawaii - You probably won't be needing to be so deep underwater to snap away those lovely corals and beautiful fishes!I'll be watching for some BRAVE SOUL to post on this one and how it turned out as well as photos; as many of us Sony Camera Lovers will be too - we will FOLLOW YOU!", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "amazing", "Author": "alexandra", "ReviewID": "R21AQZ1NER5T5C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "fantastic camera !! best i have ever had worth the money and so simple and small great for every kind of use .", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Christine", "ReviewID": "RTWBTZL35PMQD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera was received and was nicely styled and fit well in the hand.
