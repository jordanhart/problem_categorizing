{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Deflation in Action", "Author": "Amicus Curia \"pinbalwyz\"", "ReviewID": "RMZ40NDE9L7SC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My strongest negative feeling is the price on this came down $15 since I ordered it 3 days ago. And yeah, it has no VF, but then neither does it have any mirror slap. It has the same excellent APS-C sensor it's big brother (K5) has and even better video mode selections PLUS it has focus peaking.Despite all the carping, the body felt VERY comfortable in my big hands. The lens lock design for this body actually is sleeker and more ergonomic than the K5's. I'd purchased a Rokinon 85mm f1.4 prime a couple of years back, then buried it in my kit bag and pretty much forgot about it. When the K-01 arrived, I dug it out and slapped it on. WoW! A lens/body marriage made in Heaven. It felt perfect, the body and lens easily balanced with one another. The clarity and brightness in low light were a pleasant surprise. Unlike the K5, this body has Focus Peaking. It's not only a welcome backup for my K5, but has unique advantages in its own right.The rubber cover for the SD/SDHC/SDXC memory card slot is a bit more meddlesome than the hard door/cover on the K5, but it does NOT 'flop' once you take the time to slide/secure it back in place. This body has an external stereo mike input, and UNLIKE the K5, it has audio level control. It also has a built in stereo mic and I think the K5's built in is mono, though its jack is stereo.This unit may not be a spy's dream camera, but it should be any serious photographer's 'go to' camera for all around versatility and excellence at an unbelievable affordable price (currently). When I count up the advantage of being able to utilize my Pentax legacy/modern lenses, this thing just screams, \"Buy me!\"Make no mistake, this is no toy. The dials and buttons feel solid, not cheap. I would have liked a longer neck strap in the retail package.The 'play' button (when not reviewing your footage/shots) is a welcome asset in returning the focus area to the center of the frame when pushed. The K5 always takes me longer to return the focus area to the center of the frame, and when lots is happening, the time it takes can be annoying. There's lots to like about this body's design that some nitpickers and Polly Anna types have failed to recognize when they vacuously pronounce this design a marketing 'failure'. There may be no accounting for 'taste', but this body feels right in so many respects, it's a raving success here.I almost forgot something other reviewers ignored, the popup flash mechanism feels very secure and well engineered--almost like a fine Swiss watch. I'd have liked weather proofing in this unit, but there's nothing 'cheap' about the feel. As for the rubber sides instead of solid cover, perhaps that provides a little extra protection against unexpected minor bumps. Don't be afraid of trying this camera, especially with something more than the kit pancake lens. Kudos to the designer and manufacturers of this quality tool.ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS:  Another bonus feature the K-01 offers which the big name brand reviewers have all apparently missed is, not only does this body's pop up flash FEEL refined and well engineered with PLENTY of critical thinking invested in the design--It IS!  e.g. The K5's pop up flash was not available when the Rode Video Microphone (stereo) is mounted in the hot shoe. But the more thoughtfully designed K-01 allows a mic such as the Rode SVM to be mounted in the hot shoe AND allows the built in flash to operate simultaneously without having to remove the mic to allow for the built in flash. Given the instantaneous ability to switch (via the 'red' button) from single shots to video, this is a feature I doubt any other APS-C hybrid still/video camera of this quality on the market offers. Frankly, this camera's design is beginning to look like it's over some of its critics' heads.BTW, the larger body some critics disparage compared to the petite mirrorless competitors likely doesn't overheat its chip & electronic circuitry as rapidly as its smaller P&S; cousins. Another nice feature that's not mentioned in the reviews obsessing on the K-01's size/lines is it has not just interval timing for stills, but for video as well! That means you could set it up to catch a series of rush hour foot traffic, or any other anticipated regular event. This duckling is turning into a pretty elegant swan.When the price on this dropped to 346 smackers on Amazon (free shipping! No tax), I couldn't resist buying a 2nd. At that price it's cheaper than many less endowed P&S; cameras. At that price, they're GIVING this excellent photography tool away as though it were a lens accessory!", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great companion to your dSLR, or as a standalone camera", "Author": "R. Fortson", "ReviewID": "R1W3DFAXL4DYA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for a few weeks now and I must say I like it.  Owning the K5, I wanted a camera that would give me similar image quality in a smaller package.  The K-01 delivers on both counts, though it's not as small as I'd like.  However, it handles well, and the live view implementation is better than the implementation of live view on the dSLRs.  I use the DA Limited lenses on this camera, and they focus and handle very well.  I haven't tried larger lenses since I have the K5 for that.In social situations, the camera puts people at ease, and being able to shoot from the hip (literally) makes it easier to engage your subjects and still get excellent photos.I haven't shot much video with it, but having one-button access to the function is very handy.Using manual lenses on this camera is a breeze, much easier than the dSLRs for me.  With focus peaking and live view zoom, it's very easy to nail focus.If you're looking for a serious snapshot camera, this is a great choice, even if you don't own any Pentax lenses.  Teh 40mm kit lesn is outstanding, probably equal to the DA40 Limited prime (I have both and have compared them).  My only concern with the 40mm kit lens is the lack of a lens hood, thought it never caused me a problem in the time I owned the lens (I sold it since I have the DA40 Ltd).For people worried about the lack of an optical or electronic viewfinder, I've shot the K-01 several times in bright Texas sunlight, and the LCD works well enough for me to compose and focus.  Honestly, the lack of a OVF or EVF is a non-issue for me.All in all, I think this camera is a winner and well spec'd as a dSLR complement.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "I am loving it!", "Author": "Cheezr", "ReviewID": "R34N41FIQFYV2M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The more I use this camera the more I love it. I know that everyone on the internet is a critic but I am glad I gave in to my urges and got this camera.The controls are very well laid out and very easy to read and use. The menus also use a large font and are quite decent.The 40mm lens is razor sharp.The whole kit is just well made. It is the first camera that i have had in a long time that just gets out of your way and actually assists you in taking pictures. For example, when taking close up pics of flowers or whatever, you can turn on several features that give you excellent assistance in confirming your focus. Speaking of which, the AF is easily better than the Fuji X100 and on par with the Oly E-PL1.Another thing i really like is that the camera is completely trustworthy in full auto mode, you set it to scene and just concentrate on taking pictures and  they come out amazingly well (this is unlike my V1 which can take great pics but really makes you work to get them).That's my last remark, the image quality is truly exceptional! It is the best image quality i have had (better than X100). Don't believe me just go onto Flickr and do a search on K-01 and see for yourselves. I have quite useable pictures taken at ISO 12800 and ISO 25600 (realistically when viewed on the web and not blown way up).I just love this camera and i haven't been excited by a new camera in a very long time. the K-01 is well designed, well built, easy to use and has amazing image quality.If you are in the market for a new camera I encourage you to try it (after all you have 30 days to return it if you are not happy). You have nothing to lose and a great photography experience to gain.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Deflationary Pressure", "Author": "Amicus Curia \"pinbalwyz\"", "ReviewID": "R1FXWE3W1OQXUA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already purchased one of these (body only) to add to my K5 and K30. Naturally, I have an assortment of excellent KA-mount lenses, both manual and AF, legacy and modern. Some are Pentax, some are Tamron, some Rokinon, and even an excellent Bell & Howell branded 8mm fisheye. So in a world of crippling lens costs, I got a great deal. All of these bodies have built in stabilization. Remaining in a world of the K-mount series of lenses is a tremendous asset and money saver.These bodies are excellent. The metal framed K-01 is no exception. Though not weather sealed and without a VF, its other features more than compensate for those deficiencies. The K-01 I purchased @ 590 smackers was, I thought, a fantastic bargain for a unit with the same excellent sensor as the K5, K5-ii, Sony and Nikon bodies utilizing an APS-C format, given the superlative reviews for said sensor. The K30 & K-01 also have an improved processor that beats out the one in the K5 & K5-ii. But now (w/a little shopping) @ 346 smackers--well...they're essentially GIVING the body away. Why? I'm not certain. Perhaps the initial negative reviews of the design by some hasty naysayers tarnished the market for this gem. But at the current deflated price, even though I don't have an immediately NEED for it, I can't resist what amounts to a steal. I'm ordering another one! (Before they're gone)This body doesn't overheat in video mode. It's big enough to grip. Its size likely provides for the better heat dissipation. It has focus peaking. The LCD is excellent. Along with the K5 and K30, it takes great pictures. It's packed with features and fun. It's now cheaper than many P&S; cameras having smaller sensors and poorer performance. They don't have a VF either. It's a great backup unit for when your pricier K5 series is in the shop or otherwise indisposed. While not pocket sized, it's lighter and easier to carry around your neck. Did I mention it doesn't overheat in video mode? That means you can repeatedly take 25 minute clips without it prematurely shutting down. (Provided you have sufficient memory left and aren't using a resolution that will eat up the available file size before the 25 minute mark) Why all of the above models in the U.S. don't include a feature allowing successive image/video file creation without shutting down at all escapes me. Not incidentally, the K-01 uses the SAME battery as the K5, and K5-ii, though not the K30. They ALL accept the same SDHC/SDXC memory cards...more $avings. Sony's A99 body accepts 2 such cards and will record to both simultaneously, but it's $2800. Hopefully more camera makers will follow suit for the flexibility this arrangement offers. Right now, you can get an ultra-fast (~45Mb/sec) SanDisk SDHC card for around $35. Swapping is quick enough to make it a minor inconvenience compared to the Sony offering.If you're a video producer, having an extra (at such a bargain price) also allows you and an assistant to cover an event from multiple camera angles and/or w/varied lenses. The flash mechanics is refined and allows a Rode stereo mike to be mounted in the shoe simultaneously. They're not mutually exclusive. Being without a mirror, there's no slap. (unlike the K30, which is obnoxiously loud) The RED button allows for instant video clip recording--a nice convenience. The body and controls are solidly built. At its current price, this body practically becomes a lens accessory. Yeah, it's not a medium format or even full frame camera. So what? Except for specialized applications, the APS-C format shines in all other respects. The kit bag is lighter. The product is excellent. The bodies listed are versatile. I'm thinking with a proper wireless remote control trigger, you could have a studio on the cheap with simultaneous multiple camera angles. Get some lighting stands and quartz lamps at Home Depot for extra savings. They even have full spectrum bulbs on the cheap along with assorted color heat ranges.It's astounding to consider how much power this body (and its cousins) puts into the hands of the great unwashed at such a low price. Excellent photography and video composition is no longer only for the wealthy. It's now possible to document and tell those stories of your dreams. Don't be fooled by the hype and 'glamour' of the more advertised brands...this is a quality tool in the hands of a serious photographer. Even if it looked like a hamburger (actually, its looks tend to grow on you) its functionality would scream, \"Buy me!\"I read the hype of the other brands along with everyone else. I'm not immune to the 'center folds' they advertise. But in the end, I can't ignore common sense. This body just makes too much sense to pass up at this price. And, for the money, it'd make a great gift if there's someone in your life interested in photography.ps: Not only are they 'giving' this thing away, they're shipping it for free!

After a week or so of use. I must say that I really like this camera. I own the Pentax K-5 and K-X.  In the past I've owned the K-100D, K-10D, K-20D and the K-7.  This camera shoots photos of comparable quality to the K-5 and much better than the K-7.I bought the black camera and I like the styling very much.  The controls have a very modern look and are easy to use if you read the instructions. They are much simpler than the K-5. The photo quality is excellent and the Custom Image menu and the various programmable filters make it fun to shoot and to play around with the photo output. The ribbed rubber covering makes it easy to grip even without a more pronounced gripping extension on the right side.The size, for me, is just right.  I didn't expect a smaller camera since I knew it has an APS-C sensor and uses the K-mount lenses.  So far, I've used the Pentax 18-135 mm zoom lens with this camera.  If size is a real factor, I can install the Pentax 40mm Limited pancake lens or one of its cousins. The continuous live view is a real advantage in most cases as opposed to the on and off live view in the K-5.This camera is built like a tank.  It seems to be an all metal housing and the solid feel is very encouraging.  The memory card cover is easy to use once you get the hang of it.  Although a lot of reviewers have complained about the rubber cover, I found it quite easy to use once I studied its configuration.The auto-zoom feature is convenient for focus but in some ways complicates the composition of the photo.  If the subject of the photo is in the center of the frame the auto-zoom is a real advantage.  And sometimes the focus peaking function is a real advantage but other times it's better to turn it off.  In both cases, however, having these functions adds real convenience to photo taking and they are advantages that many cameras don't have.All in all, I think this camera is a hidden gem and is being greatly ignored and misrepresented by the reviewers.  At the Amazon price offered recently, it is a steal.", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not for everyone, but definitely for me", "Author": "Dorothy Gray", "ReviewID": "R31UWMY5S0U93C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Without getting into too much boring detail, I have damaged eyesight, and I have a tough time using DSLRs because of their reliance on tiny flashing numbers in the viewfinder, along with the annoyance of having to dig through various menu screens to get anything done. As a result, I am primarily a film shooter. I like my cameras straightforward. I like to think about getting the shot, not worry about the camera.Enter this little gem. It has Pentax's intuitive menu system, simple and easy exterior button design which calls to mind an old film camera, and a nice big LCD screen. It is mirrorless, so there's no noisy thing causing camera shake, but it has the same size sensor as most DSLRs on the market, and it takes Pentax's K mount lens line and older M42 glass via adapter. If you want you can get it with a nice 40mm ultra-thin pancake kit lens, which is of excellent quality; or you can get the standard kit with a couple of zooms, or a body only if you already have a set of Pentax glass.It has a nifty feature called \"focus peaking\" to aid with focusing when using those wonderful older lenses.Its video capabilities are very nice. I am not a videographer so I cannot go into a lot of detail on that.Certain review sites have complained about its ergonomics; but I tend to think these reviewers have never held film cameras and I wonder how they think a camera is supposed to be held.For me, the biggest drawbacks have been: 1) the rubber flap covering where the SD card slot goes: it's not intuitive, learning how to properly close it. It should not be closed like a door. If you do try to close it like that, it will keep coming open, or your finger will get caught on it, or some other such annoyance. The proper way to close it is to slide it back into place, then press down on it. 2) The LCD screen can be difficult to see in certain types of glare or very bright sunlight. I'm looking for the right kind of removable shade for these situations.But overall, I am extremely satisfied with this camera.

It isn't the big bulky weird looking beast that some of the critics would have us believe. Agreed it's not as svelt as the Sony NEXes or the Olympus & Panasonic M 4/3rds offerings, but that's because one of it's greatest attributes is this: if you're a Pentax SLR or DSLR owner, you don't have to make a huge investment in new lenses. All Pentax SLR/DSLR lenses fit and work with this camera. If you don't have the privilege of owning any of Pentax's great lenses,the Mark Newsom designed 40mm XS lens that came with my K-01 (I got the yellow one- way cool)is a great standard prime to start with. While amazingly, ridiculously thin, this little lens delivers sharp, well rendered pictures. The K-01's autofocus works fine in most situations, but when using a manual lens or when you find the autofocus hunting too much, there's the focus peeking feature that makes focusing a snap in any situation. The controls are well laid out and easily accessible, and I find the rubbery surface and shape of the camera make handling this camera a pleasure- never did I feel that I was on the verge of dropping it nor did I suffer any discomfort from handling it for extended periods of time. Some have complained about the rubbery flap that conceals the SD card slot, but after a few tries I found the \"trick\" to closing it and I have complete confidence in it's utility and I'm sure it will stay intact throughout the camera's life. The best thing about this camera are the pictures it delivers. Even in the lowest of lighting it's possible to get great virtually noise-free shots. I would recommend this camera to anyone who's main goal in photography is to come up with the finest quality photos- in this regard (and many others)the K-01 delivers the goods.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quirky but serious", "Author": "Pericombobulation53", "ReviewID": "R5SYJGQUAVGN0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to admit I'm a loyal Pentax fan and have been so for decades.  They are an underdog company but, well, I like underdogs and the fact is that Pentax DSLRs are extremely well built and generally offer more features at a given price point than Canon or Nikon.  That said, I was very skeptical when Pentax announced the K-01 last year.  I mean, a DSLR-like camera with no viewfinder?  No traditional optical viewfinder, nor even an electronic viewfinder?  For cryin' out loud, even P&S; cameras have optical viewfinders!  It was primarily the lack of a viewfinder that kept the K-01 off my radar until... the price began to drop.  And drop further... and further... and further.  I started reading other reviews from folks who I consider to be serious photographers who started snatching up K-01s as 2nd, 3rd, even 4th cameras.  I started hearing folks predict that the K-01 would become a cult classic in the resale market - ignored by the masses but in high demand by those \"in the know.\"Then it happened - I was invited to join a Project 365 - an online group in which each member attempts to take at least one photo per day and post it online.  It sounded like fun, but I started to wonder how I'd keep up with taking all those pictures.  My primary DSLR is in a big sling bag along with all the typical paraphernalia like flash, filters, tripod, lenspen, tubes, hoods, batteries and more lenses than I really need.  I couldn't see myself hauling all that equipment around everywhere I went for a full year, so I started thinking about a 2nd camera; Something smaller and lighter but still with an APS-C sensor.  That's when I decided to buy a K-01.The sweet spot of the K-01 is this: It naturally pairs well with older manual focus lenses.  That's not to say that other Pentax cameras don't work with manual lenses... they all do.  It's just that the K-01 has this new nifty feature called Focus Peaking that highlights hard edges in the frame which are in focus.  As a result, it is very easy to attain proper focus manually.  If you're a little scared of focusing manually, the K-01 will take you by the hand and show you that you have nothing to worry about.Also note that Pentax cameras have shake reduction built into the bodies, not the lenses.  So you can use shake reduction even with older lenses - another reason why the K-01 marries well with old lenses.The other reason the K-01 is a natural fit with older lenses is that for very little cash you can have a camera/lens combo that will take amazing pictures.  Many of the vintage manual lenses can be purchased very inexpensively used online.  Look especially for prime (non-zoom) lenses... it's a simple fact that prime lenses almost always take better pictures than zooms because they have fewer glass elements to distort the light path.  For example, the lens I use most often with my K-01 is a Pentax SMC M 50mm f/1.7 (vintage 1983 or so) which I bought for about 25 bucks.  It's an amazing piece of glass and in combo with the K-01 it produces pictures that are hard to match at any price.  You see, the K-01's dirty little secret is that it has a really good sensor.  The sensor is capable of a wide dynamic range and excellent performance in low light and at 16.1 MP you've got more than enough pixels to play with.So yeah... if absolute best picture quality is what you're after, skip the big box store DSLR and kit lens and pick up a K-01 and an old manual prime.  The total cost will probably be half or a third of what you'd pay for a big box store DSLR and the K-01 will blow its doors off every time.  It's that good.  I think a lot of serious photographers have already figured out that the K-01 and manual prime lenses go well together because that's what I hear of people doing, even to the extent of buying a K-01 for each of their favorite manual lenses so that instead of switching lenses, they just pull out a different K-01.  Don't get me wrong - the K-01 works great with new auto-everything lenses too.  It's just that some things go particularly well together... think coffee and chocolate.A note about sensors:  Size does matter.  In fact, it matters MUCH more than megapixel count.  The main reason is because of something called \"Crop Factor.\"  Look it up if you wish, but here's the gist of it:  Imagine a slide projector that is projecting an image on a screen.  Now picture the same image, same projector, but the screen is now much smaller... what do you see?  You only see the center portion of the image, right?  Kinda like zooming in, isn't it?  In this analogy, the screen is the sensor.  This illustrates how smaller sensors by their very nature inherently \"zoom in\" on a subject as compared to larger sensors.  Now try another experiment:  Look at a distant object - say a car that is 500 feet away.  Now find another object that is even farther away but in the same field of view - say a tree that is 600 feet away.  How much do your eyes need to refocus when you glance back and forth between the car and the tree?  Not much, right?  Now hold your hand up close to your face and focus on it.  Find another object a foot or so behind your hand - say your desk.  Glance back and forth between the two.  How much do your eyes need to refocus as you switch between the hand and the desk?  Quite a lot, right?  Your eyes have to refocus much more when glancing between the hand and the desk than they do when glancing between the car and the tree, even though the hand and the desk are separated by only a foot or so while the car and the tree are separated by 100 feet.  This illustrates how depth of field increases with distance.  Now put the two experiments together - how do you think a sensor that is basically always zoomed in (i.e. a small sensor) treats depth of field?  The answer is that it pretty much treats everything like the tree and the car.  Smaller sensors have a wide depth of field.  Everything is in focus.  While this may be good sometimes (like for landscapes), much more often you will want to control depth of field so that NOT everything is in focus.  If you want to take a picture of your kid (or your lunch, or a pretty flower, or the dog, or million other subjects), you don't want to see everything in the background.  You just want to see your kid (lunch, flower, dog, etc).  This is called selective focus, or subject isolation, and cameras with small sensors do it rather poorly.  That's why you just simply cannot get good portraits with a P&S...; the sensors are too small.  Long winded explanation, I know, but here's my point:  You really want a larger sensor and the K-01 has one.  As far as I know, it's the ONLY mirrorless camera with an APS-C size sensor.  APS-C is the standard sensor size for DSLRs.  Anything else is smaller and thus inferior (except Full Frame which is relatively new and very expensive).Now for the bad news (you knew not everything could be perfect in K-01 land, right?).  First of all and most annoying to me, the green and red button placement is terrible.  They should both be located next to the shutter release button.  It sounds like a minor thing, but moving these buttons would be a huge ergonomic improvement, as you have to reach across the top of the camera to hit them now and that's not easy to do when you're trying to hold the camera stead to take a shot.Second of all is the lack of a viewfinder.  Now I have to say, there are legitimate reasons why they left it off.  For one thing it means several fewer moving parts to potentially break, as the K-01 has no mirror to flip up and out of the way each time you take a picture.  Secondly, folks with glasses or declining vision may prefer the LCD screen anyway.  So I can't really criticize the lack of a viewfinder - just point it out in case you didn't notice (which I'm sure you did!).Third, the K-01 does not offer continuous autofocus (AF-C).  This is only really an issue if you take a lot of action shots (sporting events, wildlife, race cars, that sort of thing).  AF-C just means that you can track a moving subject with the shutter button half-depressed and the camera will continuously adjust the focus, so that when you press it the rest of the way, it will already be focused and can take the picture immediately.  The lack of AF-C means that you have to keep half-pressing the shutter button if you're trying to track a moving object.  Look, if action shots are your raison d'etre, then look elsewhere.  The best action cameras have viewfinders anyway (so that you can keep the camera steady against your head and locked to your eye) and the K-01 'aint got one.  Also, if you follow my advice and buy an old prime lens for your K-01 then you'll be focusing manually anyway, so the lack of AF-C won't matter.The K-01 isn't built for speed - it forces you to slow down and compose your shots.  To pay attention to framing, subject orientation, depth of field, dynamic range.  It makes you think and this is a good thing.What others have said about the rubber accessory door is totally true.  Fortunately it seems like durable rubber so I don't think it will rip off.  But still... seriously?  I'll bet someone could make a few bucks selling aftermarket K-01 solid metal accessory doors.  In the meantime, just pay attention.  If you close it the right way it will usually stay put.Finally I must point out that the K-01 is very well built.  I love how solid it feels, but if you think it's a pocket camera, then you'd better have big pockets.  It's kind of like the golden retriever who thinks he's a lap dog.To wrap up my long winded review, I'll make a few recommendations, some of which have already been mentioned above:1) Look for a used manual focus prime lens.  Any of the old SMCP Pentax 50mm lenses would be great.  I've found the M F/1.7 to be exceptional, but I've also used the F/1.4 and F/2.0 M series 50mm lenses and they are almost as good.2) If you do use an older manual lens, you'll need to enable the \"Use aperture ring\" setting.  Press the menu button and then the left arrow button and you'll see it.  If you don't do this it will just give you an error when using any old lens that does not have auto aperture.3) Disable the annoying Mark Newsom startup splash screen.  You can figure out how to disable it by hitting the Menu button.  It's somewhere in the LCD configuration.  This will save you a second or so whenever you turn it on.4) Program the green button to Action in M/TAv Mode > Tv Shift.  This will tell the camera to meter the scene and choose the appropriate shutter speed whenever you press the green button (as long as you're shooting in M mode).  You'll need to do this for any lens lacking auto aperture or else the camera will hold the aperture at its widest setting always.  Note that if you buy an old prime lens which DOES have auto aperture (the Pentax \"A\" series or higher), you can skip this.  It makes a good case for buying \"A\" series lenses instead of \"M\" lenses, but really, pressing the green button before taking the shot is not a big deal once you get used to it.  And the \"M\" lenses are cheaper.5) Program the red button for depth of field preview.  This is a very handy feature and more cameras should offer it.6) Shoot in RAW mode.  If you're not used to RAW mode, then get used to it because it offers way more flexibility in post processing.7) Enable focus peaking and leave it on.  I can't think of any reason to ever turn it off.All in all the K-01 is a fun camera to use once you get used to it.  If it still cost $900 like it did when it first came out I wouldn't give it quite such a high mark.  But as the price has dropped to under $300, you can definitely get 5-star photos without breaking the bank.  You just have to spend a little time and get to know this interesting little camera.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Image Quality", "Author": "J. \"bluemonitor\"", "ReviewID": "RCXSWLU3WH7S0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a fun little camera! The first thing that impressed me was the build quality. I know it looks pretty ugly in the pictures and resemble a plastic toy, but the fit and finish is really quite impressive - materials alone, I would prefer this over, say, Canon T#i series. This has so much going for it - takes standard Pentax-K mount lenses, standard flash, mic-in, 30fps 1080P recording, etc. THE IMAGE QUALITY IS SICK. I mean holy cow sick. Does not compromise my lens at all. Only cons are 1) lack of viewfinder and 2) slowish AF if you're coming from a DSLR... but I knew about these going in, so I am not disappointed.

This is especially true as it gets darker.Body is thicker than a NEX or NX. (However, neither has stabilization. NX lacks focus peaking)If one uses it by holding it in front of themselves, why does it come with a conventional neck strap? A wrist strap is a better idea.The Ugly:No \"Me too\" appeal. Does not say Canon or Nikon on the front.As stated in another review, this is not for everyone. It is not for the sports shooter but for those who want to get out and shoot creatively and for fun. It is also very good for video (1080, 720, VGA, all with plenty of options)  I use mine for fixed focal length lenses and not for zooms.People who never used one will howl at the body thickness. However, one can use thousands of PK mount lenses with it. The tiny 40mm lens that came with it is fantastic but I also like using a 35 year old A28/2.8 manual focus lens, as well as several others. No adapters needed! AF lenses will AF. Older lenses will meter. :-) One also gets a decent sized battery.Another howling point are the colored buttons. Access to them depends on how you hold the camera. This will vary depending on what you are shooting. One should hold the camera with two hands. Then, the placement of controls starts making sense. The buttons may be toy like in appearance but they are programmable. :-) My green buttond meters my old M and K lenses. The red button turns on Focus Peaking.The K 01 uses a Ricoh devised Focus Peaking. This and the image quality alone are worth buying this camera. It places an outline around anything that is in focus. One now has finer control over focus with no front or back focus DSLR issues. :-)It has similar features to a NEX 5N but implemented better on the K 01. Image quality is incredible, and one has more customization. If you are a beginner, i is easy to get going. If you are advanced, there are plenty of options, customization and control. Image quality and video can go up against Full Frame. For what it can do and how well it does it, it is a bargain. The big question is whether the form factor fits you.I recently went into a Big Box store to look for a new bag for it. My current bagsare too big. The sales person asked what I wanted to cary. I told him a camera and a few small lenses. He pointed me to the check in sized Nikon and Canon bags. I went and looked at the small camcorder size. He was confused and had to ask why. :-) The body may be apound but the lenses are usually less than 6 oz.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "An underrated camera with stellar performance!", "Author": "Jerry Jackson Jr.", "ReviewID": "R18TJ7QN2GYNE9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The bargain prices for the K-01 were just too good for me to pass up even though I initially thought the K-01 looked hideous and it was known to have slower AF than my Olympus E-M5.The reason that I couldn't resist is that I still have fond memories of using the Pentax Limited primes and some of my photos from back then just have a character that I haven't been able to replicate from my Olympus, Nikon, Fuji, Sony and Canon gear in the years since. I've captured some great images with the other gear, but the old Pentax shots just pull at my heart strings more.Anyway, after the K-01 arrived I was pleasantly surprised. I updated the firmware (version 1.02 on the Pentax website) and messed around with the 40mm ... a nice combination. The autofocus speed is greatly improved with the latest firmware. I also found that the box-like ergonomics make PERFECT sense if you hold the camera like an old medium format film camera with a waist-level viewfinder and vertical shutter release. In other words, cradle the K-01 in your hands so that you can press the shutter button on the K-01 with your thumb and not your index finger. Suddenly the green and red buttons are easier to press and the bottom right rear corner of the camera doesn't cut into your hand.The image details that come out of this camera with the 40mm lens WIDE OPEN at f/2.8 are nothing less than extraordinary. Stop down the lens and the details get even sharper! One of my friends who shoots medium format film thought several of the images I took with the K-01 must have come from a medium format camera with a high-res digital back ... there is just an insane amount of detail in these shots. Keep in mind we're talking about a ridiculously cheap APS-C \"cropped\" sensor and not a massive medium format image sensor here.The K-01 is a true testimony to the extreme image quality that comes from Pentax gear. The design of the camera body is so unique that most photographers don't take it seriously ... and that's a big mistake.

I was able to get several sharp photographs. However, I could not use it outside, I just could not see the screen in bright light. The only thing I could see was the focus peaking lines which helped me get a few good shots, but most outside shots were out of focus. Also the remote control software was minimal. I also discovered that when the HDMI cable is plugged in, it only supports playback and does not support live view. The battery life was dismal, it is more a function of how long the camera is on rather than the specified number of shots you can take. The battery was good for a few hours, then died.

The K20D tends to sit at home except for special occasions, and has no video capability.  The K-01 isn't as small as what I had in mind, and has no viewfinder, but I was won over by the fact that the price was very heavily discounted, and by the fact that it could use the Pentax lenses I already had.I ordered the body only, since I already had the DA 40mm Limited.  The first thing I did after the camera arrived was charge the battery, then install firmware V1.01.  I tested the autofocus first, because I had read complaints about it.  It doesn't focus nearly as quickly as the K20D, and it always hunts a little, even if the focus is perfect before I press the shutter release half way.  Still, it's pretty good compared to the point and shoots that I've owned.  It is sometimes unable to find the focus in low light, or with low contrast subjects, but it more than makes up for that with the focus peaking feature, which makes it very easy to manually focus under such conditions.I had also read complaints about the rubber cover over the card slot.  Indeed, for the first day or so I had difficulty closing it, and it always felt like it was going to come loose.  It must have worn in over time, because now it fits in place nice and securely, and I doubt that it will wear out before I've replaced the camera with something newer and better.The day after I got the camera, I took it with me when I went to work backstage at a production of The Nutcracker.  It fit in my jacket pocket, so I didn't have to leave it lying around where I'd be worried about someone walking off with it.  When I wasn't moving props around, I had plenty of time to play with the camera.  With ISO values up to 25,600, I was able to take snapshots of workers and dancers backstage in extremely low light (flash was off limits, of course), photos which I could not possibly have taken with a point and shoot, and which wouldn't have been nearly as good even with the K20D.  Some photographers wouldn't consider using anything above ISO 3200, but after running the photos through noise reduction software and using relatively low resolutions, they look fine to me; I'd rather have them than not have them.I also took some video, and found that the K-01 is able to take some very high quality video in low light.  It's also able to take some very jiggly and out of focus video too, if you aren't careful.  All in all, it does well enough for my purposes.It's not a lot of fun taking pictures in bright sunlight.  You can see the display well enough to frame your shot, but I would hate to have to focus manually.  Fortunately, the autofocus works pretty well in that situation.<edit:  Since I figured out how to set the display to maximum brightness, I have no problem taking pictures in bright sunlight.>To sum it up, I would like it to be smaller, and have a viewfinder.  But its size allows me to use my existing Pentax lenses, and for the price (under $350) I'm willing to forego the viewfinder.  If I know I'm going to be taking action shots, I'll use the K20D.  But I expect I'll be taking many more pictures overall with the K-01.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera!", "Author": "D. Stevenson", "ReviewID": "R34ZXJREWAUEVO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I cannot believe that they discontinued this camera. Talk about under-rated, this is probably one of the sleepers of the year, and now there will be no more. Once again the paid reviewers threw Pentax under the bus by reviewing all the wrong things.Ok. First lets talk about the bad right off the bat.1. Once in a while the wonderfully beautiful display screen gets washed out by the sun. That has never happened to anyone before has it? Hmm, tough one. My solution, wear a ball cap and shade the display when that happens.2. The little rubber door is not as easy to close as some of our wussy reviewers would like. Obviously they must be a bit handicapped. If something doesn't work like they are used to they have a fit. Hmm, another tough one. My solution? \"Quit trying to close it like a door!\" Instead slide it closed and press it gently into place. It works amazingly well when you do it that way.3. No viewfinder. What?! You mean none of you have ever used a camera that didn't have a viewfinder? Hmm, my solution? If you really, really need a viewfinder, buy one of those viewfinders off E-Bay that fit in the hot shoe. You can spend $30, or if that isn't good enough I'm sure someone will be willing to sell you an expensive Leica version for a whole lot more than $30. Whatever floats your boat.4. It costs too much. Yeah, you were right, it was a touch over priced when it first came out. Again, like this has never happened before. Every reviewer I have ever known has whined about the cost of a camera, whether it was Pentax, Canon, Nikon, or anyone else when they first came available. Get over it. The price will come down. They always do. If you have to be the first on the block to have one then it will cost you some extra scratch. Otherwise you do what most everyone else does and waits a few months for the price to drop a bit. In this case, since it is now discontinued, the price is VERY nice!5. Focusing. Once in a while this camera will have a bit of trouble auto focusing on something. This is very rare in the daylight and a bit more common indoors. I have to admit this is one complaint I have not really experienced. Yes, it does hunt around sometimes when it gets dark. So does my very expensive Canon EF 50mm 1.2L lens. If this is the type of thing that the reviewers find unacceptable then I guess that Canon's very expensive 50mm lens is also unacceptable. Or, maybe they are being just a bit unfair. But, like I said, I haven't had any problems yet, but I guess it could still happen. But, if it does, I do have a solution. Turn to manual focus and use the wonderful focus peaking feature (which I will talk about in a minute)and focus your lens! That is, if it isn't too much trouble.Most of the rest of the things I have read that reviewers don't like sounds like a lot of whining to me. Like the size of the camera. If you want a tiny camera then buy one. The K-01 was designed right from the start to use all those magnificent Pentax K lenses. It does that great. And it sits perfectly steady on a table, or anything else that is mildly flat, and allows you to take great images without packing one those tripod thingies. Try doing that with your wondrous Soney.Next is the fact that it was designed by some fella named Marc Newson. I have to ask, what does that have to do with the price of tea in some large Oriental country? Someone had to design the silly thing, why not this guy? Or maybe because it doesn't look like something else you are familiar with then you just can't figure out how to review it? As far as I can tell it works, and some of the design features are absolutely brilliant and should have been considered long before this camera came along. So, quit telling me who designed it and tell me how it works.Another thing I keep reading is that it just isn't as good as the Nikon, or the Canon, or someone else's camera. That is pure hogwash. I will admit that it doesn't work like those other cameras. So what? Does that automatically make it bad? In other words if it doesn't work like someone elses camera it can't be any good! The fact is, in many ways it is better! It is just different, and because its different the reviewers cannot see past their precious preconceptions.Ok, enough of this. Lets get to a few of the good things I found.1. The buttons and dials and knobs. The buttons and dials and knobs. The buttons and dials and knobs. Finally, a digital camera I can use with my gloves on. Unlike some reviewers I don't take pictures of wine bottle labels in a studio, or in Florida, or in sunny Southern California. I take pictures where most people do. Out in all kinds of weather. Cold  weather. Windy weather. At all times of the year. I just got back from my grand-daughters softball practice. Windy, cold, spitting a combination of snow and rain. Sound familiar? This camera will allow you to do all that without freezing your pinkies. And those wonderfully large buttons, dials and knobs will take care of everything you need to do while shooting. You can easily see what you need. You can easily feel the know, button or dial through the gloves. And you know that you pressed the button or turned the knob. Unlike a lot of other cameras I know where those knobs and buttons are so tiny you can't hardly feel them in the best of circumstances. But this camera is different. This Marc Newson fella certainly had his head on straight when he designed this camera. And if by some rare occurrence you do need to use the menus, they are wonderful, simple and very easy to use.2. Focus Peaking. What, never heard of that? I have a magnificent 105mm Vivitar One Macro lens in a Pentax mount that is probably the sharpest lens I have ever owned, but it does not do auto focus. I also own a couple of very nice manual Pentax cameras that focus this lens quite well. But I am no longer 20. I am no longer 30. In fact, I am no longer 40. Did I mention the grand-daughter? Lets just say that I am old enough that my eyes just ain't what they used to be. I like to pretend that I can still focus that old Vivitar as well as I used to, but I really can't. But...thanks to the K-01 I can! Focus peaking allows me to see exactly what is in focus and what is not. I am absolutely loving it.3. Image quality. This thing uses the same sensor as the very highly rated Pentax K-5. Too make a long story short, my medium format cameras have been getting a little rest since I bought this little beauty.4. Lenses, lenses, lenses. This camera will let you use any number of the thousands of lenses that Pentax, and many, many 3rd party manufacturers, have built in the Pentax K-Mount. And if that ain't enough then you can buy an M42 screwmount to K-Mount adapter and use the thousands and thousands of M42 screwmount lenses that have been built and sold. If you want it I am willing to bet that someone has probably built and sold it. And it is probably waiting for you on E-Bay. And the really neat thing is that you can focus that lens like you were still 20, even if you are still 20.5. Low light photography. Just like its bigger brother, the K5, this camera will take wondrous pictures in very, very little light. Need to get pictures of your two year old son's birthday party, and everything is lit only by those candles he is valiantly trying to blow out? Have no fear, the K-01 will get the shot!Anyway, I could go on and on, but it really boils down to just one thing. This is a terrific camera. If you take pictures in the real world, and don't mind the fact that your little camera has a couple of extra pounds around the waist, you are going to love this camera. Especially if you already own some Pentax lenses.As for all those bad reviews that those professional reviewers are intent on pumping out, I just don't understand it. All I can think of is that they must be using the yellow camera. I bought the black one so the yellow one has to be a LOT different than mine. It is either that or, as usual, they are just not looking at things that really matter in the real world. Maybe those little pictures of wine bottle labels and manikins have finally gotten to them.Pay them no mind. This really is an amazing camera and before you believe what they have to tell you, try it for yourself! You may find out you actually like it. It is too bad they discontinued it, but at least you can still own a great piece of history, and one that actually works in the real world!", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best camera deal out there!", "Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "R36QYG1L7U04M1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had tons of cameras and picked this one up last week because of a ridiculous sale.

They are roughly $800-$1100 for body only.And you can have that for $350! Or with the incredibly thin prime lens for $450. The prime lens is basically a lens cap and adds virtually no extra bulk to it. Yes, this camera is bigger than some of the other interchangeable cameras, but it's still small enough to fit into a coat pocket. With the other interchangeable cameras such as the Sonys, Panasonics, and Olympuses, the lens is sticking out so much that you can't put it into a coat pocket. Even with their primes, it still sticks out too much. But with the K-01, the lens doesn't protrude at all so it slips nicely into a coat pocket. The 40mm lens is $230-$250 by itself, so you're buying the camera for $100! It's ridiculous.So you can do this, plus use any Pentax lens out there!

If you are moving up from point-and-shoots, you maybe thought the Canon G15 or the LX7  was a brick.....ha !! So this cam is aimed at people looking for great photography through easily usable buttons and dials, not so much worried about weight (K-01 weighs about same as the smaller Pentax DSLRs...)Before buying and using the K-01, I already owned a NEX 5N and a Pentax K-30. Recently, I've used the K-01 in both the 40mm and then the bundled lens versions. I also last year joined an amateur club, and have borrowed extensively from others in the club.A./ The NEX 5N (best value of the NEX series for pure image quality) takes noticeably sharper, clearer high-ISO pictures (3200 or higher). It is today's best buy for those who value the combination of top quality stills and very high quality video above handling performance. But the K-01 blows away the premium compacts, even the P7700 which is the closest compact out there in body size and usable controls. As for DSLR's, the K-01 kept right up with my Pentax K-30 and my son's Sony A-57.B./  The K-01 is easier to operate than a NEX 5N: I've had a difficult time adjusting to the \"no-buttons\" NEX menu system. It is a chore to try to operate the NEX any faster than at a very deliberate speed. It does have a very good auto mode, but it is almost non-adjustable in auto mode, whereas the K-01 can make changes to WB and several other settings while in Auto mode. Very nice for those who want a pretty simple but creative learning camera.C./  The built-in flash is balanced over the subject area, and color rendition with the flash is very good. However, under 5 ft., this flash is so powerful that you may have to really dial down exposure or diffuse through a piece of plastic. That's okay with me, because stronger is fine as long as it is balanced.D./  Non-flash Auto WB is about as good as I've seen.  In most cases, equal to the NEX 5N, equal to my K-30, and much better than the premium compacts (LX5, XZ1, P310..)that I have tried..E./  Auto Mode will capture night scenes as well as any Night Handheld mode on any camera. The K-01 has maybe the best all-around Auto Mode on any camera - rivalling or bettering my Pentax K-30. By the way, Pentax did something amazing with the K01 - they set Auto mode's ISO range to be adjustable all the way to 12,800 !! Jeez, I love that, for the pure fun of it. I may get arrested some night, out there taking test pictures of neighbors' windows and porchlights when there's no moonlit sky to photograph.F./  However, outdoor daylight shots often need you to apply some HDR to balance overall contrast and reduce blow-outs. There is an HDR mode on the dial, and HDR level ajustments in the menu, but the HDR series of 3 shots seems nervously slow until shutter speed reaches about 1/500th.G./  Shot-to-shot time (incl. focus) is a little behind my K-30 (even when the K-30 is in LCD mode, to be fair), and about equal to the NEX.H./  With the latest firmware upgrade to the K-01, low light focus has improved to maybe a B+ grade. To be honest, all cameras have trouble focusing in low light compared to good light, and my jugment of the K-01 is that it is well in the acceptable range. In auto and on a tripod, the K-01 made a decent exposure at ISO 12,800 in the near darkness of my basement rec room. In existing light I have had few focus issues.I./  The 40mm lens is good, but remember it is a \"fixed aperture\" lens, making it difficult to compare against a kit zoom. The 40 will be at f2.8 when the kit zoom at 40mm is usually f4.0 or 4.5. The 40mm would be expected to be sharper at the exact focus point, but blur the sides just a bit more. Shooting a test of a world globe and the wall two feet behind it, the 40 was indeed just a bit sharper, but not that much. Just as with the NEX's 16mm pancake lens, I would consider the Pentax 40mm pancake to be  most useful for its physical size, rather than a huge step up in quality. On the other hand, the 40mm is probably as good as the best sweet spots on the kit zoom, so for its size you could easily make the 40mm your carry-everywhere lens.It is not sharp enough, however, to crop 200% and get a great result. These inexpensive fixed lenses and kit zooms are for better-than-average quality \"visible range\" photography, not for long-distance detail.J./  The DA L 18-55 lens is also not pro grade, but it has some good spots where proper ISO, aperture, and shutter in combination give very, very nice reults. Hey, it costs $100 new on Amazon...what do you want? Much of the time, I use Aperture mode at 4.5 and let the camera do the rest, or shutter mode outdoors at an appropriate speed for the weather/subject, and let the camera do the rest.K./  I've not fully tested the 50-200mm lens yet, but it looks usable, with no major flaw on the few shots I've tried. Again, it's only $200, and the shots I took at 80mm and 125mm were really nice. At the risk of repeating myself, buy a superzoom lens camera and a tripod if you love to photograph mountain goats 200 yards away.  -----------------------------------------------------------CONCLUSION:  The K-01 equals and maybe just surpasses the NEX series in VALUE FOR THE DOLLAR, winning for its better on-the-fly handling , its solid build , and since the NEX 5N has ballooned to $678, the K01 is much more budget friendly. The K-01 loses by a little in quallity at iso 3200 and above, and indoor video. Back on the high plus side, the K-01 can use older Pentax K mount lenses ON FULL AUTO W/O ANY ADAPTER!!! The NEX needs a very expensive adapter to use Sony DSLR lenses on Auto.  The K-01 is designed and built as solid as a brick. Since it looks like no other Pentax, I attribute this to Marc Newson, working around a literal \"box\" full of DSLR grade performance goals, including a true K-mount lens mount that inherently has a larger minimum focal distance to whatever film/sensor/mirror you have in that \"box\". I actually really like the feel of the K-01, even tho it is pretty much a two-hand shooter except for the 40mm setup. I also really like the look. I have since changed to the black one, but some of friends have told me they liked the yellow more.If only there had been a way to make the LCD tiltable like the NEX. What a camera this would have been. Maybe the tiltable LCD, tiltable flash, and better indoor video focus tracking are items for the \"K-02\" in a year or two. -----------------------------------------------------------------------KUDOS TO:  Pentax Engineering.....bold photographic platform, very close to that DSLR-in-a-box you were looking for. Performed very similar to my K-30 in almost every category except focus speed. Mostly, only the lack of a viewfinder keeps the K01 from being a DSLR....KUDOS TO:  Marc Newson....beautiful way to translate Pentax's \"functional K-mount box\" into reality. Good on ya, mate !! Or do Aussies lose that down-under talk, once they have an office in a high-rent district of London ?----------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE:I have to report that indoor video is not as good as I first thought.

I love the shape and size. It feels very solid. You can set it down on the back, bottom, or either side. The buttons are large and easy to access. The sensor is fantastic. I have the K-x and I can really tell the difference. The K-x, while great in low light, tends to blow out the highlights much more in daylight. Ever try and take a picture of someone with silver hair in bright sunlight? The HDR setting on the K-01, which takes and combines three pictures at plus, minus and standard EV settings, gives me something no other camera has ever been able to offer so readily, details in both the highlights and shadows. That is the kind of picture that I strive to take. (Yes, I know using the HDR setting is cheating).Video is very good. I didn't see the jumpiness that others have mentioned. Battery life is fantastic, way way better than the K-x. I wouldn't be surprised if one charge is good for over 500 shots. Shooting JPEGs, the multiple exposure settings are blazingly fast. Motor speed lags after the first six shots when set to RAW. I suppose that is a negative.I enjoy the artistic filters, especially the posterization, pastel, and watercolor.

Neither was an easy choice as k5 has QC issues and k30 has amateur outlook.  When I saw the price deduction in k-01, I bought it right away, hoping this would satisfy my shooting needs until a perfect model comes out in the near future.K-01 is a stylish, easy to use camera, delivering top notch DSLR level image quality.  The most impressive features are usable high ISO at 6400 and focus peaking.  I didn't buy the DA40 lens but I think this compact combination would be an excellent choice for balancing compactness and image quality.The pros:- well built and easy to hold.- clean image at ISO 6400- focus peaking, good for manual lenses.- it's a new design which is 100% compatible with my existing pentax lenses- it has everything unique to pentax, the SR, the colours,I am very satisfied with it but I deducted one star for the following cons:- slow focus, almost not working at dim light.  Better after updating firmware to 1.01, but it still occasionally struggles.- I thought it has no mirror hit problem for rear protruding lenses, but the compartment design prohibits some large rear manual lenses from fitting in. (e.g. Yashica DX50/1.4 cannot be fitted, and sadly I also made a scratch on the inside of the body).- the meter is not completely accurate with old manual lenses, but it's always a problem to modern cameras.- the body cover for access to SD card and usb connector is only soft plastic, which I'm afraid it may deteriorate over time.In conclusion, if you can get such outstanding image quality for this price, you can't really complain.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid body but, not for everyone.", "Author": "Perry", "ReviewID": "R2GB2FFTQB8J5P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Pentax K-01 to get back into photography and I figured this was a good choice as I had a few primes laying around from my K1000 days.  Now let me say I'm not going to get into all the technical specs of the camera as that isn't what photography is all about and, while there will be a few specs, they will only fit to serve a point.LOOKS AND BUILD QUALITY This camera is very unconventional in appearance and comes in multiple colors (I went boring and bought the black model, body only).  This really is all about your personal choice here but, I actually think it looks very nice as far as cameras go.Now the build quality is very high and the only issue I have is with the Rubber side cover and how flimsy it feels.  Other than that, the metal body and switches are top notch even if the body isn't weatherproof.IMAGE QUALITY This camera can really deliver solid images when coupled with decent glass and using the RAW image format.  Digital noise is very low going way up into the ISO range, contrast and sharpness are also very good and there's a whole host of image settings in the camera, to give you just the look you wants.AESTHETICS Pentax could have jumped on board with all the other mirror less designs but, they remained loyal to their base instead and delivered a body without the mirror box but, left enough spacing and their normal lens mount in the body.  This means every Pentax lens just works with this body, even without an adapter and I wish more of the other camera companies would take a page from this book. Another area where Pentax remained loyal was the hotshoe.  Several of the other companies decided to forgo the hotshoe altogether but, Pentax again remained loyal to their supporters and used the same hot shoe as their other DSLRs.These are very big for those with lots of expensive Pentax gear and I have to give big props to Pentax for this.METERING The cameras metering system seemed very functional and pretty solid on accuracy.  I found no major issues with blown highlights or excessively dark underexposed images.  This is about as solid as any other in this class.AF SYSTEM The auto focus seems to be fairly accurate and has decent consistency overall.  However, it is a pretty slow system when comparing it to the leaders in this market segment.  If you're in good lighting, you will get good results but, as the EV ranges drop so does the accuracy.  This is the one area I expect Pentax to improve significantly in the next generation of this body.CONCLUSION The K-01 is a solid body for the money and if you have any investment in Pentax gear, this is no doubt, the mirror less body for you.  If you're new to the world of Digital Interchangeable Lens cameras, then give it a good solid look and see if the body meets your needs.  If you're on a budget, then this body is also a good choice for you.  If you need speedy AF and faster than 3 fps shooting or you are invested in another systems glass, then pass on this body.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buy One Now Before It Is Too Late", "Author": "6x9 \"6x9\"", "ReviewID": "RGVVYU1FPP068", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In short:- this camera has carefully made analog controls. The mode switch and the power On/Off switch are both metal, so as the top o the camera which accommodates the flash.- has K-AF2 mount and accepts all K-mount lenses (and screw-mount lenses with an adapter).- has very good in-body image stabilization- has nicely implemented and convenient HDR mode- highly customisable, there are also two \"quick\" programmable buttons.- a bit bulky (but who said that it should not be?)- heavier than other mirror-less cameras, despite the fact that the outer shell is plastic (except for the flash top cover)- produces amazing photos, even at high ISO settings- has powerful built-in flash- menu is logical and straight-forward- takes the same battery as K5, K5 II(s) - meaning a lot of power and ideal backup camera for those who uses these SLRs.- exists in various paint schemes/color variations- focus peaking - great feature!- the DA 40 F/2.8 has 27 mm filter size (sort of odd for a stills camera)Do not make your judgement about this camera based on internet reviews only. Many of those have been written when the camera had just been released with v 1.00 software. So, many reviews mention sluggish and unreliable AF. This is not true anymore with the updated software (although the focusing speed is not supersonic either). Keep also in mind that the price at the time when most of the reviews had been written was still close to $1000, this also influenced final judgments.Hold this camera in your hands for some time and try different lenses with it. I find that the DA 40 XS is not the best match for this camera, as the lens is too small and light. With a camera having nearly SLR dimensions and weight you need a larger and a bit heavier lens.  The Pentax DA 35 F/2.8 Macro lens is a perfect match for me. However, this is my personal preference and you may have a different opinion.Take pictures with your favorite lens attached. You will be very impressed by image quality.I would like to address several negative points expressed in some reviews about this camera (I mean different reviews found on internet).- no classic optical or electronic viewfinder. It is  fine for me. You just need to get used to a different shooting style. Back to the photography era when cameras had  glass screens to focus.- LCD screen is fixed (not articulated). Perfect for me. Less to break. In one year of using my Olympus E-M5 I have only had to tilt the screen once. Why then to complicate the things?- it is heavy and bulky, and has no good grip. Nope, it is solid. It feels dependable. You will get used to it - just need to put a bigger lens as I said above. The 40 mm XS is just not the best fit from my perspective.- AF is sluggish. Not anymore with current s/w. It is noisy with screwdriver lenses and not as fast as on recent Panasonic and Olympus M 4/3 cameras, but it works well and is reliable.With current bargain price you can not go wrong.

Wide open (2.8) it can have purple fringing in very contrasty situations (for example in windows) but that happens with many other lenses (so it is normal), if you stop down (5.6) the chromatic aberrations go away completely even in the worst scenario. Personally i didn't miss the viewfinder, with the big and bright screen it is quite easy to focus and compose, i always wear a cap or a hat when the sun is strong so the sunlight never hits the screen directly, also the focus peaking function helps a lot, specially if you use old manual lenses, the other day i went to make some shots with a 135mm manual lens and almost all my shots are in focus. One thing i didn't like so much is the grip which is not so good, with small and light lenses like the 40mm xs or other like 50mm 1.7 it isn't a problem but with long and heavy telephotos (of more than 500 g) your hand becomes tired faster. Overall i think this camera is quite good, i would recommend this one to persons who shot in RAW, care a lot about image quality and are on a budget. It is not a camera for sports or fast action, sure any good photographer can get good shots in any situation but this camera (only 1fps in RAW, 6fps JPG, slower autofocus system but more accurate [no front focusing] ) is not optimized for that.

Aub", "ReviewID": "R2NXZJ7JYDW9I7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First things first, you must upgrade the firmware on this camera from 1.0 to 1.01.  The upgrade vastly improves the auto focus capabilities of this product and the K-01 now produces great results. Now on to the formal review.You have to commend Pentax with their decision on going \"bold\" with the design and implementation of this camera (You can go online and read numerous review article mostly condemning Pentax for not conforming to standard DSLR / ILC camera design, but as you will read in this article, the camera produces overwhelmingly solid results): Although it is a mirrorless and not an SLR camera, its size is closer to that of an SLR. (For comparision, I also own a Pentax k-x and it is smaller (slightly) than the K-01 (but not as thin)).  The thing also does not have a viewfinder which was/ is a major turnoff for some. However, the unit has an excellent LCD screen and (as most folks who are reading this probably know) is backwards compatible with all K-mount lens, which is wonderful since I have some really nice vintage glass that I can use with this product.Hands down, the images this camera produces are spectacular.  The 40mm pancake lens is super sharp and unobtrusive. No, this is not a camera to be used for certain professional scenarios (sporting events, photos requiring a zoom lens, etc), however for the vast majority of prosumer outings, this thing holds its own and does so exceptionally.The biggest complaint I'd give the camera (and the reason why it gets 4 out of 5 starts), is the lack of a view finder.  I took the K-01 with me to shoot an outdoor art exhibit and at times it was difficult to see the shots in the viewfinder under harsh sunlight. That in turn can make it difficult to set up your shot since you may not be able to see the images in the LCD properly.  In that respect, the K-01 is more in line with a point and shoot rather than a DSLR (since most do not have viewfinders).  Regardless if this \"flaw\" (if you want to call it that) , the pictures this thing produces absolutely trounces any point and shoot out there (even the Sony RX100 , especially if you compare the two cameras in low light settings). Most people may want to gravitate towards the RX100 because it is smaller and more portable, but considering how K-01 sells for about $200 less than the RX100 AND produces better quality photos AND is compatible with all K-mount lenses, I think it is a no brainer to choose this product over Sony.This camera is not a replacement for a good quality DSLR. But if you are in the market for a second camera and want something that behaves and is usable like a point and shoot but delivers stellar quality phones comparable to a DSLR, then this is the camera to beat.  Even if you don not have any K-Mount lenses, the 40 mm pancake lenses that comes with the unit is a workhorse that produces sharp pictures, even though you are sacrificing any zoom capabilities.I am glad I purchased this camera.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Thinking about Getting a Yellow One Also", "Author": "Kentucky Colonel", "ReviewID": "RA242HPD6RMY6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I doubt there is a better buy in the current camera market.  The photo quality is superb - due to the sensor being basically the same as in other #1 rated cameras from Pentax, Nikon and Sony.The camera, while not a compact unit, is smaller than my dSLR because there is no hump for a pentaprism or an eyepiece - that helps it fit nicely into smaller cases.  A regular dSLR is too tall for some cases.I had to get used to the rubber flap covering the memory card slot, a main complaint of others - but I did get the hang of it, and there IS a second, spring loaded cover to the slot - so it's not as though the card is in any danger of getting loose.Yes, the video image does suffer from a \"scrolling\" effect (that's not the right term, but other reviews talk about it) if you're panning from side to side - but I don't use it for video.  (It does have a nice stereo sound if you just want to record a scene without panning.)  However, if I want to shoot video,  I don't use a changeable lens camera anyway.  I get out my Ultra-Zoom Point-n-Shoot with 35x and Image Stabilization all built in.  I can't think of any dSLR at any price that can be fitted with a 24-840mm lens (equivalent) at any price - and the higher digital noise of a small sensor camera isn't an issue when the image size is only \"HD\" and moving at 24 or 30 fps.The K-01 also uses the same wonderful powerhouse of a battery as the K-5 and K-7.

I've been a long-time Pentax user, but left for Nikon a few years ago, after Pentax went along with Samsung sensors (big mistake on part of Pentax!).The color is vivid but still true, and the images just look so much more pleasant than my Nikon.  The low light performance is stellar.  The autofocus is snappy and mostly accurate, especially after the firmware upgrade.Though I first thought it was stupid to make such a big mirrorless, I now realize how convenient it is to just use any Pentax lenses without any hassle.  Basically, if you want a travel camera with the same quality of a dSLR at reduced size and weight, I cannot think of anything else as a better choice.  Sony NEX cameras are so much limited by the availability of lenses.  Panasonic and Olympus cameras in the M4/3 format, regardless how much people are raving about them, are still no-match for the cameras based on APS-C sensors.Oh, how can I forget about the in-body stabilization, which makes every prime an optical-stabilized lens?  Also, with magnification and focus peaking, you can manually focus any old PK lens without much effort.  Any other cameras can be so backward compatible?  At least I am not aware of any, other than Pentax.So, this is the camera I often recommend to all my friends, but unfortunately it is not readily available now.

The SR system works very well (it does make some noise as the sensor shifts).  Peak focusing is really nice.  The image quality is superb.  Despite the controversial appearance of the camera, it is a stellar performer.  I bought it at a blowout price right after Ricoh pulled the plug on that model.

Smith", "ReviewID": "RAVC2DQDQQAXT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm writing this to respond to the previous review, which is inaccurate.  Normally, I wouldn't respond, especially for a discontinued camera, but the review is so inaccurate, I felt compelled to respond.I have two K-01s.  I bought both in December from B&H; (sorry Amazon).  I bought the first in early December, then ordered the second after using the first for 2 weeks.  I especially like the terrific image quality, focus peaking (assists with manual focus), the interval timer, the camera's look, and its small size (relative to most dslrs).I also currently use a Pentax K5.  In the past, I used a Kodak/Mamiya 645 medium format digital back combo for 8 years, a Kodak 14N full frame digital SLR for 9 months, a Nikon D80 for 4 years, a Nikon D2h for 7 years, a Canon Digital Rebel (the first) for 6 months, a Sigma SD9 for 6 months, and a Sony 717 digicam for about a year.  In addition I previously used 4x5 large format, Pentax 67 medium format, Canon FTB, Canon EOS 10S, and Olympus rangefinder film cameras for many years.  So I know digital and film image quality well.Contrary to what the previous review says, the image quality of this camera is top notch for APS C.  You don't have to take my word for it, since there are a multitude of reviews here at Amazon, at B&H; and all over the internet which all agree about the image quality and directly contradict that review.I like the K-01 a lot, and on a tripod in low light, I prefer it to my K5.  Not having an optical viewfinder is an advantage on a tripod, because the K-01 was designed to use live view and has focus peaking, which is very helpful when you're trying to focus manually and/or in the dark.  The K5's live view is more difficult to use because it doesn't have focus peaking, and it clearly wasn't designed for primary live view usage.  For example, the K5's live view will time out after a few minutes, and drop out of live view because of sensor overheating.  Also, if you playback an image to check focus, the K5 will drop out of live view, so you'll have to press the live view button again to continue shooting.  All of that makes it much more difficult to use in low light/the dark.Handheld though, there's no contest.  K5 all the way handheld, unless you're in a situation where you don't want to bring the camera to your eye.If you're coming from a DSLR or SLR background and shoot primarily handheld, the K-01 will likely feel strange and awkward to you.  To me, it feels unnatural and takes quite a bit of practice to master.  After 9 months of use (mostly on a tripod), it still feels awkward when I shoot handheld with it.  Relative to a DSLR, it's slow to operate, slow to recover after an image is shot, and its autofocus is slow.  On the other hand, if you shoot primarily on a tripod or monopod and prefer to focus manually, or you're coming from another camera without an optical viewfinder, you'll likely love it.The 40XS lens is quite a good lens.  It's sharp, and has the excellent color rendition that Pentax are known for.  If you shoot into the sun, it will flare a bit, but most lenses will flare much more.I haven't used the video features much, so I won't comment on them.5 stars for tripod use, 3.5 stars otherwise.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Oh, boy!

I have the black body with the pancake lens.Have shot about 500 stills with it.I have shot semi-professionally since 1967- when I was doing high school newspaper work. A lot of my DC years included shooting \"grip and grin\" shots.My eyes are aging - so is my ability to \"see\" creatively - becoming an issue.From a near pro shooter - I have devolved to being now more of a \"picture taker\"...Unfortunately I learned that mine - (a gift from my brother) was a \"gray market\" model by Abe's of Maine. NO US warranty on it. Be careful buying one unless it comes from Amazon (US market version) or Adorama.My brother also gave me a great used Pentax 50-200mm AF zoom, a Holga lens for a Pentax K mount and a Nikon Ai (older not AF) Nikon to Pentax adapter for my older Nikon glass. This is my first Pentax after being a life-long Nikon shooter.This is a camera to play and experiment with. I am still fine-tuning my favorite modes on the camera. Focus peaking has been a great feature for manual focus work.I wanted one of these after I read Joe Farace's good review on the camera in Shutterbug magazine in 2012. From friends at the Google K-01 and Q groups - my mind was also made up to try to buy one. At one point the camera kit with the pancake lens fell to as low as $299US then went up to $499US.Unfortunately - Ricoh - new owners of Pentax - killed off this model from production in less than 11 months. Stupid.This initial quirky looking mirror-less DSLR \"platform\" takes ANY Pentax K mount lens ever made. With the usual 1.5x magnification on the sensor. The Pentax/Sigma/Tamron AF film or digital lenses shine with it. Manual focus lenses with no aperture linkage - still can be used.The battery life is great on the camera unless you starting shooting a lot with the built-in strobe - then it goes down a bit.It has a time lapse mode - which I have yet to have tried. Haven't shot any video more than 90 seconds on it.Am planning to plug my Shure mic mixer into the audio jack - to feed other mics in - for video. Monitoring audio is only by a \"meter\" on the camera's viewing screen when shooting - no ear piece jack offered. Pentax actually shot several \"point of purchase\" videos with the K-01!I need to save my $$ to get a wider angle lens of a diagonal fish-eye. With a T adapter - I could use my 500mm Vivitar mirror lens - sans AF - on this camera. Also a bigger Pentax, Vivitar or Mecablitz shoe mount strobe.I bought a remote camera trigger and a flash shoe adapter to use the K-01 with my Calumet studio unit and older Vivitar strobes. Have been playing with an old flash-panel and LED light units with it.When using the built-in flash at night - the auto-focus illuminator has been great.The camera CAN hunt auto-focus in some instances and when it does that - I go to manual focusing with it.My only concern about the camera is the rubberized battery door eventually falling off. Maybe the only design \"flaw\" on the camera.Other than that - a great design concept.It's fun and enjoyable to use!

As time goes on I'll post a follow up, but initially I can't tell you how impressed I am with this little camera for the price. This camera is surprising a lot of people I think after an initially bad opening run. News is that Pentax re-introduced it to the Japanese market (after declaring it discontinued). They should do the same in the US market as I don't believe this camera has run its course at all.First the bad: I'm not a huge fan of the design, and the ergonomics are really not great especially compared to my trusty K-20D. That camera (and probably other DSLRs like the K5) just fit your hand very well and are a joy to hold, but I've not really experienced any problems with the K-01 functionally. Had I not experienced the ergonomics of other Pentax DSLRs I probably wouldn't complain at all. The card/HDMI slot is covered by a goofy, flimsy rubber cap and not a hard door. It takes a bit of fiddling to close up, but, again I consider it a minor issue. The hinges are thin rubber strips and will probably tear over time with any rough use. This is my least favorite feature. But the camera has so many pluses that I decided to over rule this and give it 5 stars since it won't affect shooting.I wasn't sure how I would like not having a viewfinder but so far I'm really digging it. Point and shoot photographers have been shooting this way for over a decade now (including some very fine pro street and urban shooters) and though I like through the lens viewfinding for composition, I'm not finding any real limitations with this. The LCD resolution is very sharp and you get a live preview of your exposure that I found pretty accurate, something you don't get in an optical viewfinder. Not only that, but I can opt for the histogram and light dark area preview to show in real time (not after I've taken the shot). I did a severe direct sunlight test on the LCD with the sun overhead and slightly over my shoulder. The worst condition I could think of. Even though detail was compromised, I was still able to see the scene well enough and compose a shot. I did not expect this based on reviews I read and expected to have to run out and purchase an LCD viewfinder, which I still may eventually do.The pluses of this camera are many and I won't go into them all. If you do a search and read the reviews you can find many of them. This is essentially a mirror less K5, with a few compromises in things like external physical button controls and ISO range. But given that the K5 is a best in class ISO shooter its ISO spec is not really much of a compromise compared to the rest of its class. The sensor, processor and image quality are the same as the K5. The other plus is the price for feature ratio which is very good. I challenge you to find any other interchangeable lens camera with this much quality, capability, and lens compatibility for a comparable price. I purchased this with the pancake lens for about $400. If this camera continues to be discontinued in this market, the price may go down further. However since Pentax's announcement I have only seen the price stabilize and even go up a bit.Probably the most outstanding feature to me was (and always is) Pentax's habit of making cameras compatible with all their lenses past and present. This allows you to put some pretty fine manual glass on the camera going back even to the old Spotmatic days (with a screw mount adapter), and with focus peaking (a manual focusing aid) and in camera shake reduction (rather than lens based SR) this camera has a very good video spec too. This is HUGE folks! Imagine sticking a really high quality (vintage) manual 135 prime with macro on an HD video camera with shake reduction to boot. Uh huh!Speaking of video, I have not done a lot of testing yet but the specs are good. Better in some respects actually than its K5 cousin. An external mic port is included. Something the K-30 and even the new K-50 don't have (don't ask me why?) The outstanding video features are yet another reason I bought it and rate it high. Choice of automatic OR manual focusing in video mode is quite nice. I have yet to test those features but I'm anxious to do so. I've already seen a few very impressive short films shot on the k-01 and the possibilities appear to be very exciting.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Forget about all the bad reviews and buy it", "Author": "Raj", "ReviewID": "RAAVV6BTUB9G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used this since 2 months and only one thing comes to my mind is- 'Amazing'.

The issue manifests itself as an error message when you first turn on the camera. Some have reported that it can also happen after a picture is taken.My own experience is that this camera seems to perform best with smaller cards, 16GB and smaller. I see the issue when I tried to use a Lexar 32GB UHS1 card. I have since bought a Sandisk 16GB UHS1 card and I haven't seen it give me an error yet. I've also used an older Sandisk 8GB class 4 card without issue. The unit I got came with firmware 1.03 installed and I updated it to 1.04 and the memory card issue still persists with my 32GB card (but not on my 16 or 8).

In full manual mode, the focus peaking feature is incredibly useful. With my old K20D I struggled to get sharp pictures. With the K-01 the only reason I get blur now is when I use too slow of a shutter on hand held shots.The 2s/12s timer works well when you are taking shots using a tripods and you don't want to create blur from pushing the shutter. I bought a wireless remote and that works just as well. It has a hot shoe for external flash, an a built-in internal flash.I like the built-in HDR modes, though understandably the output is only available as a JPEG. It shoots in both \"raw\" DNG and JPEG formats. One really nice feature is that when shooting in JPEG mode when you review the last shot you took you can save it in RAW DNG mode while it still lives in the buffer.Movies are in Quicktime MOV format using H.264 MPEG-4 AVC. I haven't played around with the movie modes, but I didn't buy it as a movie camera. I understand that it suffers from \"JellyCam\" rolling shutting effects due to its CMOS sensor.

I tried formatting another brand of card, resetting the battery, etc.  It was stuck flashing yellow no matter what.  Finally, a Pentax tech told me it was defective and I should return it, which I did.  I love this model enough to immediately order another one exactly like the first.  I have my fingers crossed that it will work out, because it is just the right match to my other lenses and camera bodies, filling a void that nothing else I've seen can do.  That little 40mm pancake lens is astonishing!  I see that some people are repackaging the body with other lenses and selling the 40mm separately for more $ than the whole kit, and I'm not surprised.  And yes, the lack of a viewfinder is a bit of a pain, but I CAN wear a hat, after all.  It's worth the sacrifice to get such a great camera and lens at an affordable price--first camera on the market with \"focus peaking\".  Fantastic, sharp images and pretty fast.  I love the retro design and the size is fine with me since I can use my old lenses or pick up some of the great old manual lenses for it.  At today's prices I can't afford to buy a professional body or a \"limited\" lens to get unlimited quality but this gives me a fighting chance.  I can't believe that Pentax discontinued this camera and am so glad I snagged one before they became unavailable--and have my fingers crossed that it it will prove that the first camera defect was a fluke.  I love the Pentax system (starting with my old Spotmatic) and predict that the K-01 will become a cult classic.UPDATE:  As 2014 rolls around I've taken this camera to Alaska and done much more with it.  The focus peaking has stolen my heart, virtually guaranteeing in-focus shots just as I want them.  It's a wonder that they discontinued this model and I'm sure glad I got one.

I have some Pentax lenses from the AF film era and thought I might use them on this camera. That has worked well - I have fitted a Sigma 28-80 AF to the Pentax body and it works well. AF is fast enough - I have not had a problem with that. The lens is the main limitation for shooting moving subjects in anything less than bright sunlight.The camera handles well and it is great for trying unusual angles such as holding at ground level to photograph my pet dog. That can be done with a DSLR but it is a lot harder to do one handed!Design is cool - the camera looks good and works well. Batteries from Pentax seem to be hard to get and expensive so I have bought two from another manufacturer (on Amazon). These work fine.As an update, I can advise I now have the 27mm B+W filter. This fits the 40mm f2.8 lens perfectly.  Having the 40mm lens on, as I did today, really reduces the bulk of the camera. The photos I took with this lens are great. Very sharp, nice colors. Better with a moving subject than my 28-80. Auto focus was once again fast enough, I had no problems.The auto focus can be a bit slow in very poor light - I had problems getting it to focus at a party where the room was quite dark. I might use manual focus next time I am working in really poor light. When I was taking photos at a stage show with lighting (see one of the pictures in the customer images gallery) the auto focus worked OK, so I think it has to be really poor light to require manual focus. I updated the firmware to V1.03 (the camera has 1.0 in it out of the box). Easy to do, just go to the Pentax web site and download to your mac or PC then put the update on a SD card (or plug the camera in to the computer).

Performance wise, DSLR's will have the edge in the autofocus department. DSLR's also have a viewfinder that the K-01 lacks. But the K-01 is a powrful machine that delivers terrific pictures under various challenging conditions; including low light light situations where I find ISO 6400 to be a usable setting.Comparing the camera to other mirrorless cameras I find that the K-01 has an edge in the IQ department, and also, in the compatible lens department. Because the K-01 does not need an adapter for K mount lenses, you have a very wide variety of lenses that will not lose you any IQ or functionality. That is pretty significant.The negatives of this camera according to many is its design and size. I don't find the camera unattractive, and the added bulk does have a positive, and that is that when attaching a large lens on the camera you won't find an inbalance of weight between the body and lens as you will find in some other mirrorless cameras where the body is small and the lens is long and heavy. The consequence of having a  small body and heavy and long lens is that their could be some imbalance of weight and it would be somewhat uncomfortable to hold.However, the K-01 is bulky, so, if you want something lighter and smaller this camera might not be for you. The K-01 is still smaller than a DSLR, but it is bigger than most mirrorless cameras.In a lot of ways the K-01 is a hybrid of camera between the mirrorless class and the DSLR class. The K-01 is considered a mirrorless camera but the pictures are DSLR like quality, and the use of any K mount lens without any adapter is also DSLR like.I also enjoy the amount of features and customizations that Pentax has available. Plenty of filters to choose from; plenty of customizations to shoot how you prefer; and there is also post processing available.In my opinion, the biggest negative is the autofocus, which is not slow, but lags behind the latest mirrorless cameras that have super fast autofocus.All in all I find the camera to be unique with some key advantages over other mirrorless cameras. Picture quality, low light performance, and the ability to use any K mount lens without any adapter are these advantages. There are several excellent mirrorless cameras around this price range, but these key differences are significant and unique, and therefore gets a 5 star rating from me.The 40mm lens that is also designed by Marc Newson is very good.

Garrard", "ReviewID": "RIEQSFU4P63F5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pentax's K-01 may have failed to online press but pleases it's owners greatly. I could just stop the review right there.However, I must press on...this camera got a major unfair handshake and the score needs to be settled.The K-01 came out at a time when the press made expectations from every camera manufacturer about releasing their own mirrorless camera. And because the K-01 didn't meet their expectations, the press misunderstood this camera greatly. They lambasted it for the most part calling it ugly, fat, and totally missing the point - amongst other things.Totally unfair.Mirrorless today is still an experimental and developing camera platform. There were no rules then, and there are no rules now for this new frontier. As camera sales started to slide because of the digital camera bubble bursting and a poor economy, few camera makers started taking to experimentation again to fuel consumer demand, others just continued with the safe bet.Pentax, instead of making yet another \"me too\" camera like many other makers chose to do, decided to do something courageous and different with the K-01's design. And instead of being praised for experimentation (something the press and enthusiasts normally demand) the \"different kid\" on the block was made fun of and ridiculed.The K-01 was designed to target a different audience. This is a fun camera, meant to put the spontaneity into photography and draw in shooters who were normally intimidated by the look of a DSLR. There's a touch of class to the design, and thinking outside of the box. Yet despite its intent, the K-01 is also capable of high level performance ensuring new users could grow into the camera and learn. The K-01 also gave a much smaller body available for Pentax users who wanted something a little different and compact to shoot with when needed. The K-01 was obviously not meant to be a pocketable camera, and this was on purpose- it wasn't an oversight as many press seemed to think. It's also not nearly as large as reviews would have you believe.A huge advantage- Instead of starting a new lens mount that would derail owners of K mount lenses, this camera allows instant compatibility with all K mount lenses. Wasn't that hardly noticed by press? Sure it was mentioned, but not applauded as it should have been, and gives the K-01 a major advantage over competitors.The K-01 has many abilities and features that other makes and models only dream of. Its menu system is replete with customizable functions and sports high end features that allow the camera to shoot in a very wide range of circumstances- just like many high end Pentax DSLRS. Yet its looks and design manage to cater to those who want a simple but fun shooting experience. It's image quality scores the highest among ANY mirrorless camera even today. It's new firmware, showing full support by Pentax of its buyers, gave the K-01 much faster autofocus and additional features and stability.It's battery life, handling, video capabilities, and studio photography capabilities are top notch - adding to the value of the K-01 even more.Take this to a party and I guaranty you may get a couple laughs, but you'll get a lot more praise for a fun loving camera that can shoot better images than most Canon DSLRS on the market today. Laugh until you see its images. Ridicule till you know its capabilities. Then lets see who's talking.The K-01 isn't a perfect camera by any means, but no camera is. I dare anyone though to take this camera out for a day, come back and look at the images, and say they aren't impressed. If you let your guard down about it's looks, you might even enjoy shooting with it, and what do you know- even start to like it.A camera that shows high owner satisfaction despite the short sighted press, its a winner to it's owners.(A full review of this camera will be posted on my blog dub dub dub photographic-central dot blogspot dot com in the coming weeks).Carl", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Slick, easy-to-use body with tons of lens options", "Author": "Brianna Sheldon", "ReviewID": "R3SMLSENXAIAIF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*The Body*The Pentax K-01 is a relatively compact camera body (considering it mounts all K-mount lenses and needs to be deep enough for the mount and the focal distance of those lenses) with a nice, clean design.

Now I know that you can find other APS-C cameras in the $300-400 range on clearance these days (Samsungs and even some entry-level Sonys), but from the reviews I've read, they'd be hard pressed to beat the image quality of this Pentax!Plus, I totally LOVE the strikingly unique color and form factor of this fat yellow baby...you go, Marc Newson!  It feels pleasantly and reassuring SOLID in my hands, and haven't had any button confusion that others have complained about.The Pentax menu system is pretty much self-explanatory and intuitive...I have not had to refer to the manual much, albeit I know I am only using a small percentage of its full capabilities.I am going to start a photography night course in a few weeks' time, after which I will update my review.  But so far the pics that I've taken in \"Auto\" mode have been gorgeous, including the ones where I was playing with the manual focus in order to get a \"bokeh\" effect.The 40mm lens does require me to step back a lot farther from my subject than a normal 24-28mm wide angle lens, but right now I am reluctant to take on the extra bulk of the very affordable Pentax DA 18-55mm kit zoom lens...plus the zoom doesn't do much if any bokeh, sadly enough.

The photos are amazingly crisp and clear.  Even after all of my pre-purchase research, it has performed better than I had imagined!  At this point, I can confirm most of the positive feeback the camera has received, so will rather address two of the main negative marks against it.In all the research I did leading up to making a purchase, the major doubters of this camera referenced the lack of viewfinder and the AF speed (oh, and the design, but that means nil to me as I'm more concerned with what the photos look like than I am the equipment capturing them!).I will admit that the screen was a bit tricky to see at times in the sunlight, but I was able to find a way to shield it in most cases.  Though the viewfinder options are scarce, they are out there, so I may be looking into it.  But in all, it's not an insurmountable issue for an amateur photography enthusiast such as myself.Re: the AF, the firmware update is HUGE.  I shot most of the day without it, but as the sun went down I decided to put the camera down and process the update.  I noticed a huge difference, which quickly quelled my concerns over the AF issue.  But the upgrade is a must.  Note: I upgraded to v1.01.I am not a pro, by any means, but have always had an affinity for cameras and photography.  If you're looking to upgrade from a P&S;, need a tagalong for your DSLR or you're in the market for a camera that will give you more creative control and focal length options, as well as very high image quality, then this camera will not disappoint.The other final contender in my price point was (surprise, surprise) the Sony NEX-5N.  I played with it for a bit before purchasing the K-01, but the give-and-take on the pros and cons between the two was so close I couldn't justify spending the extra money.  And I'm glad I didn't.

All of this, makes me feel like i own a great camcorder, that has slow focus picture taking ability at maximum focal length with the added bonus of using interchangeable lenses.  Kind of makes me feel like a videographer, not a photographer. My fixed lenses and lenses at min focal length adjust adequately in both photo and video situations and the color is much more diverse than my old k-r.  One last downfall is the grip and the sd card cover which seem to go against a more traditional feel, i almost felt like it should come with a camcorder strap built in on the side.  Focusing with the lcd and not a viewfinder takes a minute to get used to but its actually kind of fun!

All it has is the LCD screen which can be very difficult to see when using the camera outdoors on a sunny day.  I partially solved this problem with a separate shoe-mounted finder.  However the accessory finder and evidently any other shoe-mounted device has to be removed to use the internal flash.This camera's claim to fame is that it will accept any lens with a Pentax K mount.  However, when using any Pentax camera, beware of some of the lenses made for Ricoh as some of these have a stuck pin problem that can make the lens very difficult if not impossible to remove.  The claim that all K mount lenses will fit this camera is meaningless because there is no way to accurately focus manual focus lenses.  The peaking feature was suppose to allow the user to manually focus lenses but this feature is so imprecise as to be useless when doing critical work with a shallow depth of field. With peaking, in-focus elements show up as silvery glittering picture elements in the LCD.  I made a series of test shots with a 80-200mm Tokina manual focus lens. Coming from both directions, from far and from close, I would focus until the peaking just appeared in the LCD on my focus target.  Every exposure made in such a manner was out of focus.  If, with a continual focus, I noted when the peaking appeared and when peaking disappeared and tried to focus near the middle of the range, I would get satisfactory focus about 1/3 of the time.  I read one professional review done shortly after the camera was available in which the reviewer claimed that their were also problems with the auto focus.  However I updated the firmware from version 1.00 to 1.01 and now the auto focus seems generally satisfactory.  There is a menu choice on the camera which will show the firmware version.  Any of these cameras still using the original 1.00 firmware should be updated.Another potential problem is with the USB-HDMI-memory card cover.  It is secured to the camera body with a flimsy rubber hinge that does not inspire confidence.Other than the above problems, the camera seems to work well.  Considering the onboard APS-C sensor, the camera is a real steal at the less than $400 body-only price tag, even with the finder problems.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "What could have been great...", "Author": "D.

While I really wanted a true SLR, I figured the K-01 would be a good match for me.  I do prefer using the LCD since I wear glasses and composing using the viewfinder can be difficult.  I also know the contrast focusing system tends to be much more accurate (with Pentax cameras), thus eleminating the front focusing problems I'd had.Well, when I first started playing with the camera, I was quite impressed by the focusing speed.  it still focuses much like any SLR running in live-view, but about 25% faster.  As long as you keep the lenses below about 100mm, they focus very fast and accurately...most of the time.  Problem is in fairly dark areas, the camera simply wont lock on anything.  And when you get beyond the 100mm mark with a lens, the focusing speed begins to drop tremendously.  Once you hit about 250, its about a 1/10th the speed of say the kit 40mm lens.But you may say this isn't a problem as you'll be using faster lenses like the DA 40mm.  Well, at least for me, I couldn't stand to hold the camera for more than about 10 minutes.  The camera has almost no grip to hang onto.  So after using it a short time, my hand began to cramp.  I think it's because you can't really wrap your fingers around it, you're basically pressing your fingers into it.  And this is no small P&S; or mirrorless camera like some others.

Picture quality is fine for Monitor display at ISO3200.Update: drop the rating to 2 stars for their poor customer support. Called Pentax USA and China support line to request firmware flush for Chinese language support. The answer was like: \"support is country specific\".Video recording mode does not support continuous focus. Rolling shutter effect is obvious in the 30fps mode, but less noticeable in the 60fps mode.
