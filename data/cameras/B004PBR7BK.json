{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love this camera!", "Author": "MaureenJ", "ReviewID": "R55WDGLHVFJOM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a professional photographer - but I love how this camera handles itself. I have been slowly upgrading my camera preferences over the last few years - buying a new one every other year. It takes wonderful pictures & I can't wait to learn how to use all the features.  I haven't used the tripod yet but the other accessories are handy.  The bag is the perfect size and is holding up well. I use the camera for family outings and get-togethers.  I no longer miss the cute shots of my toddlers running around or smiling only for a moment.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$719.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 12 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Canon EOS Rebel T3i Digital SLR Camera Body & EF-S 18-55mm IS II Lens + <2> Canon EF-S 55-250mm IS Lens + <3> Transcend 16GB SDHC 300x Card +\n<4> Spare LP-E8 Battery + <5> Vivitar 58mm UV Glass Filter + <6> Additional Vivitar 58mm UV Glass Filter +\n<7> PD Digital SLR Camera Case + <8> Precision Design 57-In.
