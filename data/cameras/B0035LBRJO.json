But I think there's a lot of personal taste involved in buying any expensive camera, and you should try out several cameras \"live\" before buying this or any other one. I'm not going to repeat the pros and cons listed in other reviews - by and large I think others have done a good job pointing those out. I'm probably the target market - I was looking seriously at a Canon G11 or a Lumix LX3 before deciding to plonk down a bit more cash for this. I am happy with this camera because my priorities are:- small size: I hike a lot, and want a light camera that will happily go in my backpack with lunch. DSLR's were just a little too too bulky for my taste. I really like the size of the camera, was willing to pay a bit extra for it. At some point I will probably spring for the 17mm \"pancake\" lens to trim it down even more. But when I have more cash. :-)- SLR quality pictures: I was into hobby photography in school and got away from it when work got busy. I want the ability to take some nature and travel pics that can withstand some enlargement. The pictures I'm getting out of the E-PL1 are gorgeous, and I'm really excited about \"taking it on the road\".- speed isn't an issue: a major complaint about the camera is that the autofocus isn't as fast as on some other cameras. For sports photography, that's probably an issue. For scenery and portraits, who cares. It's not so bad that I'd have noticed if the reviewers hadn't mentioned it, but then I'm not used to using a DSLR.- don't care about a viewfinder - I've got astigmatism and with glasses, viewfinders are a pain. I went out shooting at sunset and intentionally shot with the sun on the LCD screen, and while it wasn't ideal,I could still work with it.Read the reviews at dpreview, steves digicams, photographyblog - lots of good information and analysis. Frankly, I'd ignore most of the message boards and blogs, too many people getting ridiculously passionate about minutia. If you are THAT serious a photographer, this isn't the camera for you. But 95% of us AREN'T so into photography that we will sacrifice our firstborn rather than give up our allegiance to Panasonic/Canon/Nikon/whoever. So be thoughtful about your priorities, and go handle it in a store for a while. For my needs, it just fit.", "Date": "March 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Alot of camera in a small package and smaller price tag", "Author": "Mario Antoine", "ReviewID": "R6S9GQZN0AQK8", "Overall": "5.0",

.com\"", "ReviewID": "RNHIFQUX9TJXD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What do you get when you take Olympus PEN and mix it with a stripper (Of course I mean someone who strips features from a camera).  You get the E-PL1 camera which is a little bit of a mixed bag.  On the one hand you have one of the best versions of the m4/3 sensor to date.  From what I have read it is better than both the E-P1 and E-P2 sensors.  It is hard to tell the difference at normal screen and printing resolutions and I take a picture at its whole and don't pixel peep so I cannot verify that.  What I can say is this camera is capable of producing world class images.  Additionally, this camera has the Olympus JPEG engine which is regarded in the business as one of the best.  This camera is also relatively small and light and includes a fill flash.  Additionally, it has image stabilization (IS) built into the camera.  It is not pocketable and the size of this camera has more to do with the lens that it is wearing then the actual camera itself.On the other hand, you have a camera that is slow to focus.  It appears to me that it zooms to infinity (and beyond) and then catches the focus on its way back in.  If you are taking pictures of forever-in-motion kids you can be sure you will miss quite a few decisive moments.  Additionally, this camera lacks the most important camera control there is.  This is the control wheel used to change exposure, aperture, and shutter settings in a quick efficient manner.  Instead this camera uses buttons which is an unwieldy way of making these changes.  Most higher end Point and Shoot (P+S) cameras have some version of this control wheel.  I think anyone transitioning to this camera from a DSLR or high end P+S will be frustrated by this.  I've seen this billed as a good thing as there are less controls to get confused over.  That may be so but all m4/3 cameras can be used as point and shoot by just keeping in the intelligent Auto(iA) mode.  This simplifies the menu options and takes great pictures a majority of the time.I think for anyone who wants to step up from a P+S to take better Image Quality pictures but plans to stay in the iA mode 90% of the time, then this camera will serve you well and will take some amazing images.  Just remember P+S type focusing speed.Anyone, who has a E-P1or E-P2 who want a sensors with a weaker Anti-Aliasing filter (i.e. less detail lost to the AA filter) and a fill flash will enjoy this camera for the IQ but will probably be frustrated with the loss of the control wheelAnyone either stepping up from a high end P+S such as the LX3, S90, or G11 will be impressed with the images, but not blown away by the difference, unimpressed with the P+S focus performance, and frustrated in the P, A, S or M shooting modes.  Additionally, you will be unimpressed with the bigger size of the camera but will enjoy the flexibility if your budget includes other lenses.Anyone, getting this as a second carry around camera to a DSLR, will be happy with the smaller size and weight but unhappy with the slower performance.  And frustrated by the clumsy controls but happy with the video capabilities.If you don't need or want the video, don't mind IS in the lens instead of the camera, and can put up with a slight decrease in you IQ, ISO, and JPEG performance, then the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1 12.1MP Digital Camera with Lumix G Vario 14-45 mm f/3.5-5.6 ASPH Mega OIS Lens (Red) offers many upgrades at the same price (Integrated 1.4mp EVF, Swivel Screen, 460k screen, Grip for bigger lenses, faster focus performance, etc)For the same price, the newly announced G10 matches the E-PL1 with video, and new processing engine (cross your fingers for a JPEG improvement).  Additionally, it has a 2kp EVF (I'm not sure how useful that will be), a grip, a control wheel, a 1/4000 shutter speed and faster focus performance.  It does not have in-camera IS.For those planning on getting the EVF at some point or with an ~$200 greater budget, check out the newly announced G2.  Take the G1, add 720P 60/50fps video, an improved processing engine, a new dial to change focusing modes, touch screen controls that look to work as slick as an iPhone, and touch screen focus, and you have a really really nice full featured camera.Finally, if you don't need interchangeable lenses or don't plan on buying any more lenses and you don't mind a degradation of IQ, then the Canon S90, Canon G11, and Panasonic LX3(Leica D-Lux 4) are easier to carry around everywhere (especially the S90) and are cheaper(the gap will close when the price of this camera falls).Here is a quick list of pros and cons of the E-PL1ProsThe best Olympus implementation of the m4/3 sensorOne of the best JPEG engines in the businessRelatively small and lightBuilt in flashIn camera Image Stabilization(IS)Price (The cheapest m4/3 yet)Optional EVF (A very nice 1.4mp unit but very pricy at $279)Its availableNice build qualityConsSlow Autofocus (Panasonic has this figured out.

Hagen \"RMH\"", "ReviewID": "R30WGYGNDSIC1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I think this camera is a good option for a certain niche of photographers. Let me first say that I have a lot of photographic experience. I have had several film SLRs (Nikons and Canons), I understand lighting, depth of field, ASAs(ISO), etc. My point and shoot pictures with compact cameras usually come out pretty good. But I felt the need to get an SLR again to go back to my old creativity. I looked at several. I held them in my hand. I looked at the lenses, I read the reviews, and in the end, I just don't want to lug those things around anymore. I know that when I travel, which is where I take most of my pictures,I want to be comfortable. I could fool myself into thinking the size and weight won't matter to me, but I know that it will. So when I saw the micro four thirds cameras I checked them out. I looked at the Lumix and Olympus ones and even the Samsung NX10. For the most part they ARE smaller than SLRS, but not all that much, and they are a bit heavy. This might not bother most people, but as you can tell I'm getting lazy in my older years (I'm 60). Then I saw the new PL1 and it is smaller and lighter than any of them. I was intrigued. Well I bought it and just took it on a trip.  I liked it ALOT. It's light and small, although obviously not pocketable. With the lens off, it travels well too. In my hands it took great pics. I used the aperture and shutter speed priority modes alot. It also has useful scene modes and an auto \"point and shoot\" setting. The clarity of the photos for the most part is very good. Is it as good as a $3000.00 Nikon? Obviously not. But for most people, it's MUCH better than any compact camera they have ever had. I think that should be the comparison. I'm happy with my purchase.", "Date": "April 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nearly perfect solution", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"ariel42\"", "ReviewID": "R32ITLQK4BT1HA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking to replace the trusted Fuji-F31FD point-and-shoot, which was getting a bit old after 3 years of heavy use. My other camera is Canon 450D DSLR, which is most often used with Canon L EF 24mm 1.4 lens.I became intrigued by micro 4/3 standard and checked reviews for the latest offerings by Panasonic and Olympus with the following priorities in mind:1. Picture quality (both JPEG and RAW)2. Size3. Price4. Ease of use5. HD videoI did not care for a super-quick AF since will continue using Canon for sports pictures. Built quality is not as critical since I do not expect the camera to last more than 5 years anyway. In the end, I bought Olympus EPL1 with the kit 14-42mm lens and an additional Panasonic 20mm 1.7 pancake lens.I find the initial results truly amazing:1. Picture quality with Panasonic lens is much better than expected. In many cases, IQ is better than my Canon DSLR. Panasonic lens is incredibly sharp while the Olympus colors are gorgeous (may be a bit over-saturated). Actually, some of my friends are complaining that there is to much detail in their portraits taken with EPL1. Brought the camera to the local pro-photo store and the owner (professional newspaper photographer) could not believe picture quality from EPL1. Panasonic lens is excellent in low-light and Olympus in-body stabilization makes the combination even better.2. The size is not as small as a regular P&S; but comparable to super-zooms. I think it is good for hiking, skiing, city, and restaurant photos (people do not really like a huge DSLR lens pointed at them in a restaurant)3. The price is good in comparison with the results4. The camera is very easy to use. It has some learning curve due to many options (more than Canon). I find that AF speed with Panasonic lens is not an issue and the latest Olympus firmware upgrade is supposed to eliminate the problem completely (Update: 24-Apr-10 According to the latest DPReview comparison after the firmware upgrade, Olympus auto-focus with Panasonic lenses is the fastest in the class).5. HD video is great (though MJPEG with 720P or 1080i  and not MPEG4 or H.264 with full HD)Cons:1. The screen is relatively low resolution. Still the displayed image is clear and in my opinion better than Canon 450D.2. I do not care much for the included IB software, prefer using Lightroom3 Beta2 instead.Since the camera is new, it is a bit difficult to find the right accessories. After some shopping on the internet and in a local photo-store, I added the following:1. A couple of MaximalPower replacement batteries2. Transcend 16 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card3. B&W; 46mm Sky filter and Hoya 46mm multi-coated UV filter (for Panasonic lens)4. Opteka Professional Wrist Grip Strap5. Tamrac 5693 camera bag with belt loop. Perfectly fits the camera with either kit lens or the 20mm pancake with an extra pocket for spare battery and filter (but not much more).6. Lens cap keeperIn short, I really enjoy the camera and with the accessories it is a nearly perfect solution for my needsPS 17-Apr-10After about a thousand pictures and one hiking trip:1. Pictures are still amazing, both JPEG and RAW. I noticed that the camera encourages me to take more creative shots2. Great improvement in camera size over 450D particularly for hiking3. A wheel would be useful for quick aperture changes during hiking trips4. A non-standard USB cord is a nuisanceFinally, I think EPL1 is a great little camera, may need to upgrade my 450D though", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Budget Admission into Micro-4/3", "Author": "Paul Liesenberg \"pablo\"", "ReviewID": "R5WH4I6X74KZB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought the Olympus E-PL1 so this review will be updated once I have truly learned to exploit the cameras ability a bit further. First of all - if I could give it 4.5 stars if this system allowed for it.If you are looking into this camera, chances are you are like me: you already own a good compact (in my case, among others, the Canon S90, which has very positive reviews for its fast lens and image quality) but you always wonder if you will take better pictures with a bigger, more serious camera. The lure of the bigger sensor, since it promises better results, especially in low light conditions - all the experts say so, right? Then again, a full-blown DSLR seems too big and bulky, and you wonder if you'll really take that thing anywhere. Luckily, vendors came out with the micro-4/3s format, which packs a much larger sensor (5 to 9 times larger than a compact camera's!) into a typically stylish, sleek looking design. Panasonic and Olympus had been offering models that, with lens and all, would set you back around $1,000. A tad too pricey for an experiment. Obviously Olympus set out to truly makes the E-PL1 appeal to the masses with the price point for the E-PL1. I was like, \"sure, at least this will not be the most expensive mistake I've ever made\".The camera feels solid. I love its Bauhaus style retro design that supposedly harks back to some very collectible Olympus classic model. Well, I'd never seen one, but I like the looks of the E-PL1. Side by side with its more expensive micro-4/3 competitors (in house from Olympus and the Panasonic) the E-PL1 seems more plasticky and lighter. But compared to a compact it feels like the proverbial metal brick. I picked the silver one (it's also offered in other colors, make sure to pick the one you like so you don't regret it later).The package is the usual fare - charger for the battery, battery, camera body, the 14-42mm lens, and a few convenient covers for lens openings. Also included a USB cable. A proprietary one, of course, it annoys me that vendors keep doing it, there is absolutely no reason why Olympus should not have used a standard USB cable format. Also a cable to attach the Olympus to your TV. Finally, the usual software package (I own Photoshop, so I do not install the vendors' packaged software) as well as a suitably thick instruction book. Which I will make a point of reading thoroughly, probably more than once. Needless to say, no SDHC card included, and a fast one is recommended. Especially if you shoot RAW (which I admit I just do for 5% of my shots, if that).The feature set is very impressive, and I shall not bore you cutting and pasting the many modes etc from other places. Everything you'd expect is there: full auto (come on, we don't but a camera like this to leave it in full auto, do we?), P mode (programmable auto, which is what I typically use on the Canon S90 for point and shoot), and aperture and shutter priority. See a list of the specs here (Olympus site, Amazon cuts off links).But one set is something new and needs to be pointed out - the Art Filter. Very cool for playing around, I immediately played with the Soft Focus and the Diorama mode, very fun effects and very well done. Of course it's stuff you could do in Photoshop later with any picture, but it's also great to have the ability to capture a mood and differentiate your shot in real time. It's a great idea by Olympus so that people can feel like artistic photographers right away within minutes of buying the E-PL1.The sensor in the camera's body is large, you can take a good look at it when you take the lens off. Which also means it is exposed, so be very aware you need to protect it like your own eye. Talking about the included kit lens, the 14-42mm needs to be multiplied by 2 to arrive at the equivalent 28-84mm range. Which means it is fairly wide at the low range, but a 3x zoom may be very limiting to those used to their 5x and higher in compacts, especially since it starts at 28mm. Focus enthusiasts should mentally factor in the $ for a more powerful lens. As well as its potential size.First impressions: it starts up very fast, an SLR advantage in general. Ready to shoot right away. Of course, first you must have removed the hood lens and perhaps unlock the lens if you had collapsed it for easier transportation (most pictures you see of the 14-42 lens are in the collapsed compact position - it's quite a bit larger when you take pictures. That makes the speed advantage against a compact more relative. The E-PL1 also focuses and does it's scene evaluation faster than a compact. Not immediately as some larger SLRs, but quite quickly. Since it doesn't have an assisted AF beam, it remains to see how it performs in low light. But the camera's speed seems very good. The LCD is 2.7 inches, meaning it's smaller than the one on my 3 year old Canon G9, but it is a very nice one. And it better be, since you don't have an optical viewfinder (which I admittedly never use on my cameras which offer it).I know what you are thinking - \"Stop telling me the obvious, tell me how it compares against that Canon S90 you also claim to have!\". Ok, impatient reader, I have a gallery for you:[...] [again, Amazon does not allow external links, sorry]A very important caveat as you look at these shots: I know how to use the Canon S90 and have it set up so it performs in ways I like. But as you can see, that is within limits, and while I could have further optimized the results... I decided not to, because for obvious reasons I do not yet know how to truly go about exploiting the E-PL1's capabilities, which I am sure reach significantly further than these shots reveal. Up to now, I have taken exactly a dozen shots with the E-PL1, so I would suggest you do like me, and take the shots as very inconclusive. The *one* thing that matters is that depth of field shot: the S90 is lauded for having the ability to create depth of field effects, as the f2.0 lens suggests, and as you can tell from that shot, great for a compact camera and all. The Olympus lens spec does not get anywhere near f2.0 because it doesn't have to - the lens and sensors are much bigger, and thus far more light makes it in anyhow. Check it out - the depth of field is much better defined on the E-PL1, it blows the S90 easily away in all aspects of that shot. But I have to admit I was a bit surprised the bigger dynamic range of the bigger sensor wasn't more visible in the contrast rich shots.But I think one thing you should take away from this is that you probably should not expect to see a *huge* difference in everyday shots between a good compact like the S90, and a camera like the E-PL1 - or a $5,000 full blown DSLR kit, for that matter. What you do get is more flexibility and creative control - not necessarily far more detail and what not, not for your average snapshot. If you like to take difficult shots, different matter. So make sure you buy a camera for the right reasons.I for one know I am going to like taking pictures with the E-PL1 a lot. I also am already considering buying other lenses, and have already ordered the external flash (the E-PL1 does include a pop-up flash, but it's small and as such probably limited). There it is, the trap of the modular kit - the camera price is just for admission. As I consider lenses, I find myself wondering whether to go for specifically built micro-4/3 lenses, or more generic 4/3... hmmm. If you buy this camera and start buying lenses (there isn't a lot of choice in lenses built specially for this camera, but supposedly a few are coming), you'll have to do the same, and I shall be interested in your thoughts.The final question you may ask me is \"hey you say you like it, why only 4.5 stars?\" - like I said, I think it's 4.5 stars, very good. I may update that once I learn to further optimize results and they start to blow me away, which hasn't been the case yet. Probably it was a bit much to expect to be blown away by the difference without having learned the camera more.PS on 3/20/10... a few weeks into ownership, I *LOVE* this camera and it entirely and totally deserves 5 stars. I changed the default settings, and now to my eye and the eye of people that look at the pictures results are fantastic. I am able to chose utterly sharp or utterly artistic pictures, and the quality of them right away out of the camera is fantastic. I ove the freedom it gives me in lower light situations - it will not challenge a top range Nikon, but it is amazing and far more portable.I am *VERY* happy with this purchase, and have already bought several lenses to expand on my toolset.Amazing little camera.

Lozada", "ReviewID": "R3JFFY4JYXQHH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been a pro photographer for 5 years now, and I never know what to tell average people when they ask me about what camera they should buy if they aren't asking about DSLR's.  To me, point and shoots produce noisy files, they have the flashes in the precise place to maximize the potential to make you look awful, and given my choice, I'd probably rather shoot with my iPhone instead.Of course, it's not like I haven't had to deal with them- my wife still has her Canon SD600 and until last year, I had a Leica D-Lux3, which had nice glass but couldn't be trusted above ISO 200, because of the blotchy noise that would show up, largely from putting too many pixels on a sensor that's a quarter the size of a postage stamp.When the Leica was lost, I put off replacing it for the longest time because I didn't have to, and I just couldn't commit to a Canon G11, which could work with my pro flashes on its hotshoe, but was still pretty bulky.Then I discovered the Pen.I've always liked Olympus cameras for great color rendering, ease of use, but hated their insistence on using their proprietary xD card format-- hard to find and too expensive.  But the Pen is SD/SDHC memory, and even better, it has this HUGE (for a point and shoot ) sensor- a touch smaller than a crop frame DSLR, and about 5x larger than most p&s; cameras.  That makes the images sharp, the higher range ISO choices usable, and in general, the files don't look point and shoot-like.The Pen is part of an interchangeable lens system, but I didn't purchase anything beyond the lens that's included, a 14-42mm lens.  I might buy a 17mm prime lens for it, as the camera is a little thick (about 2 inches from screen to lens cap) in the closed position, and is not a pocket camera configured thus.  It runs on the Four Thirds format, but I immediately told it to shoot stills in 2:3 ratio for easy 4x6 printing, and set the video capture (720p HD, for those of you scoring at home) to 16:9 widescreen.  My feeling is why set yourself up for disappointment when your framing of a photo/video leads to you having to crop out something important just to make it usable.The menus give you tons of control if you want it, with ability to set ISO, white balance, exposure compensation, and all the things pros like, but it also has some simple modes like Intelligent Auto and some scene specific things for people who know what they're hoping to shoot but don't know how to get there without hand holding.  It even has tips for improving your shot built in for newer Photographers.But for me, the big pleasant surprise was the flash.  Olympus gave you one that pops up on a spring loaded arm, but they tucked that under the flash when not in use, so that when it opens, the flash head is brought up and forward.  I discovered that I could use a finger on my left hand and bend the flash arm back SO I COULD BOUNCE THE FLASH OFF THE CEILING. It's a whole new world when your flash opens up the room instead of microwaving your subject. (I recommend an extra tick of exposure compensation for this.). There's also a hotshoe for external flashes or radio controllers.Video was very smooth, microphone nice and sensitive.  It looks much better than other P&S; HD video, again, sensor size makes a massive difference.I've had mine for a month, and used it as a walk around camera for 4 days at Disney World, and used it as a location scouting notebook for a job. The client liked the Pen images so much she ordered 7 of them as 20x30 and 40x30 canvas prints!  What other P&S; could you blow up files that large with?I am completely thrilled to death with the Pen.

I don't know if it is still available there, but there are bargain prices on this camera on the internet, and the Amazon price is not really that bad now either.I have a lot of photographic experience, although I'm not a pro, just an advanced amateur - since 1956! During that time, I've gained a considerable knowledge base of photography and cameras, from the old completely manual thru the new fully automatic ones. My DSLR is a Canon 40D w/an assortment of big lenses, so I can say with experience that this Olympus is fully equivalent (photographically) with the Canon, although at about 1/4 the weight (at least it seems that light in comparison to the Canon's weight with it's 300MM zoom lens!); however the Canon is better (operationally) in those few instances where a large and heavy DSLR is actually required.The Olympus is an advanced camera, by any measure, although Olympus has unfortunately (in my opinion) marketed it as a \"move up from a point-and-shoot\" model - which has unfortunately resulted in a few erroneous bad reviews from point-and-shooters who apparently know nothing about photography and cameras in general, like DEN's review. It is deceptively easy, \"simple?\" to use, due to the extensive customization available thru its compact menu system and its iAuto shooting mode, but it's the results that count, however the settings are achieved.I've just returned from Disney World and the Panama Canal - with night photos of fireworks over the Cinderella Castle and Epcot's fireworks finale in HD video (both hand held - at night!) and they turned out fantastic - where's the low light focusing problem? I shot videos and stills of the Canal's locks opening as well as ship traffic in the canal and family photos aboard my cruise ship, all hand held with in-body stabilization - couldn't have done as well, or at least better, than with the Canon 40D's heavy stabilized lenses!In short, if one has beyond-the-basics knowledge of the elements of general photography (with any camera), has read the manual, knows how to set the ISO, shutter speeds, and lens openings (and what they are used for), this is an excellent camera with fantastic image quality with few practical limitations and a superb array of available lenses (not limited to only those from Olympus).My advice to others contemplating this small, light weight, and fantastic \"travel\" camera is - get one while they are still available at these mark-down prices for they will not be available much longer!  In fact, go ahead and add the accessory viewfinder, which I did, for bright sunlight and waist-level photography, at less total cost than a newer E-PL2, E-PL3, etc.  With the recent firmware upgrades from Olympus, you'll have an even better camera.In my opinion (again, relating to the fundamentals of photography and cameras), the newer E-PL2, E-PL3, etc. add only \"frills\" like 3D effects, etc. at two to three times the price, with the same lenses and image sensor, thus with the exact same photographic quality and results (depending on the photographer behind the camera!).", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "First review I've written", "Author": "CasualConsumer \"MacFan\"", "ReviewID": "R180HALSSFKJY6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been wanting a new camera for awhile and my wife and I have been looking at DSLRs but have been hesitant as we have no idea how to use all the features/settings of a DSLR.

Mind you, the Olympus E620 is already one of the smallest dslrs' you can buy in the market, but it wasn't always convenient to carry it around, especially when you with a group of friends at a dinner or just walking around the city. The EPL-1 is almost inconspicuous, just a bit bigger than your more advanced point and shoot.Feature wise, its a step down from the EP1/2 in a few areas, and a step up in others. For one the build is not as stellar as the elder PEN siblings, but still good enough. It feels solid and it is comfortable to hold. The interface is a little complicated if you upgraded from a P&S;, but if you moved down from an Olympus DLSR, you welcome the familiarity. I love how Olympus allows you to make your menus as complicated or simple as you wish, hiding the more advanced options until you need them. So I can set it up just like my E620, and yet have my wife use the compact like menu options when she uses the camera.The picture quality is just the same as the E620, as they use much of the same internals, sensor, a new image processing engine. So in many ways you are getting the same picture quality, while giving up very little (max shutter at 1/2000, weaker image stabilization) while you get the newest features that improve upon the E620 (new image processing engine, 720p video)I have largely compared the EPL-1 with the E620 rather than the EP1/2 because these two camera fall in the same price category, so basically for the price of E620, most of everything in a EP1/2 in a smaller compact body with very few compromises.

There seems to be a bit of confusion surrounding the Micro 4/3 camera and the niche it is intended to fill. At first glance it seems this camera is some kind of \"in between\" for consumer and pro SLR grade cameras, however I would have to say from my experience that this leans closer to SLR in terms of performance and picture-taking quality.What I think about using itSince I am not a pro photographer, nor do I have any aspirations to be be one, I like a camera that will work well without me having to spend months figuring it out. I should say that while I don't want to be a pro, I like getting pro-level results and that's what I like about the E-PL1; it does exactly what I want (most of the time), and using the iAUTO setting allows you to take really great photographs without having to pay a lot of mind to advanced settings. I think it is important to remember that for about $400 you are getting a camera that will take absolutely beautiful photographs - not just mere snapshots. The best of the consumer pocket cams will not even come close to what you can achieve with the E-PL1 in terms of photographic quality. The pictures are certainly on par with what my friend's Nikon D90 can achieve.Lenses and Add-onsBeing able to swap lenses is great, it adds a lot of flexibility to the camera. While I really like this ability, and I do have multiple lenses for my E-PL1, this may be one of the weaker points only because the selection of 4/3 lenses is relatively small. All I have right now are the Olympus zoom lens that came with the kit and the Lumix 20 mm pancake lens which I use most of the time. The pictures turn out great with either lens, but the Lumix lens does a better job of capturing the subtleties of the scene. I am considering purchasing a wide-angle lens sometime in the future but for now I am more than content with the two I have. The lenses for this camera are very small and light, so taking them with you is not a problem. You don't need a massive camera bag if you just want to bring one or two extra lenses. In addition to lenses you can get other accessories like a flash or viewfinder. Personally, I found the LCD screen to be more than adequate even in bright, sunny conditions. I was recently in Southeast Asia where it's always hot and sunnny, and had no trouble framing shots during the day...or night for that matter.ConvenienceSome people may complain that this camera is too big or heavy, but really, for what it is, it is perfect. You don't need to put it in a bag, just get a padded strap and wear it on your shoulder or neck. You can stuff extra lenses into your pockets or a small bag, and since there is an integrated pop-up flash you do not need to bring an externally mounted flash. A quick word about the integrated flash - it works great, has decent range and the camera does a good job of balancing the exposure to prevent washed-out photographs when using the flash. On the down side, the flash does take a big long to \"warm up\" before it is ready to go. Overall the E-PL1 is giving you SLR-quality results without having to lug around a big full-size camera, and for most people the E-PL1 will be more than they ever need.Auto FocusAs others have mentioned, the auto focus on this camera can be a little \"iffy\" at times. Even in well-lit scenes, the camera can hunt around before finally locking in on focus...but it does have a constant AF mode which will attempt to \"track\" the subject as it changes focal planes. Personally, I stick with the standard AF mode. This camera is able to capture fast motion shots without giving you a blurry mess, but if you are doing something like sports photography you will certainly want to use the continuous shooting mode. Combine that with a quick SDHC card and you can capture pictures sequentially as the action happens, increasing your chances of getting that perfect shot.Video RecordingThe E-PL1 does record 720P video and it does so well. Although a dedicated camcorder is still better, this camera records high enough quality video that you can leave the camcorder at home and not really regret it. If video recording is not your primary objective then you will be content with the results you get from the E-PL1. I do believe there is a stereo mic attachment you can get to improve the sound quality of the video recordings - that is something you should get if you plan to do more than just the occasional video, because the sound quality with the built-in mic is not that great.DurabilityThe final point I'm going to touch upon is build quality - which is excellent. This camera is very durable and feels solid in your hands when holding it - not cheap and flimsy like many newer electronics do. It does feel like it could take a few hits but I would not want to drop mine to find out. The camera body may survive but the fragile lenses would most likely be damaged on impact. Overall I would expect my E-PL1 to last a long time and provide many years of quality photography.My conclusion is that the E-PL1 is an ideal camera for both individuals who want to take high quality photos as well as pros who want a camera they can use \"most of the time\", saving the full size SLRs for studio work and such. I really love mine and I have absolutely no second guesses about buying it. It's not often that such a high quality product is made available at such a reasonable price...but as far as cameras go this one deserves high marks because despite its minor flaws, it excels where it counts the most.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Nice Camera But A Bit of A Mixed Bag", "Author": "shuTTL3bus \"shuTTL3bus @gmail .com\"", "ReviewID": "RYAJDPFKCJORY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What do you get when you take Olympus PEN and mix it with a stripper (Of course I mean someone who strips features from a camera).  You get the E-PL1 camera which is a little bit of a mixed bag.  On the one hand you have one of the best versions of the m4/3 sensor to date.  From what I have read it is better than both the E-P1 and E-P2 sensors.  It is hard to tell the difference at normal screen and printing resolutions and I take a picture at its whole and don't pixel peep so I cannot verify that.  What I can say is this camera is capable of producing world class images.  Additionally, this camera has the Olympus JPEG engine which is regarded in the business as one of the best.  This camera is also relatively small and light and includes a fill flash.  Additionally, it has image stabilization (IS) built into the camera.  It is not pocketable and the size of this camera has more to do with the lens that it is wearing then the actual camera itself.On the other hand, you have a camera that is slow to focus.  It appears to me that it zooms to infinity (and beyond) and then catches the focus on its way back in.  If you are taking pictures of forever-in-motion kids you can be sure you will miss quite a few decisive moments.  Additionally, this camera lacks the most important camera control there is.  This is the control wheel used to change exposure, aperture, and shutter settings in a quick efficient manner.  Instead this camera uses buttons which is an unwieldy way of making these changes.  Most higher end Point and Shoot (P+S) cameras have some version of this control wheel.  I think anyone transitioning to this camera from a DSLR or high end P+S will be frustrated by this.  I've seen this billed as a good thing as there are less controls to get confused over.  That may be so but all m4/3 cameras can be used as point and shoot by just keeping in the intelligent Auto(iA) mode.  This simplifies the menu options and takes great pictures a majority of the time.I think for anyone who wants to step up from a P+S to take better Image Quality pictures but plans to stay in the iA mode 90% of the time, then this camera will serve you well and will take some amazing images.Anyone, who has a E-P1or E-P2 who want a sensors with a weaker Anti-Aliasing filter (i.e. less detail lost to the AA filter) and a fill flash will enjoy this camera for the IQ but will probably be frustrated with the loss of the control wheelAnyone either stepping up from a high end P+S such as the LX3, S90, or G11 will be impressed with the images, but not blown away by the difference, unimpressed with the P+S focus performance, and frustrated in the P, A, S or M shooting modes.  Additionally, you will be unimpressed with the bigger size of the camera but will enjoy the flexibility if your budget includes other lenses.Anyone, getting this as a second carry around camera to a DSLR, will be happy with the smaller size and weight but unhappy with the slower performance.  And frustrated by the clumsy controls but happy with the video capabilities.If you don't need or want the video, don't mind IS in the lens instead of the camera, and can put up with a slight decrease in you IQ, ISO, and JPEG performance, then the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1 12.1MP Digital Camera with Lumix G Vario 14-45 mm f/3.5-5.6 ASPH Mega OIS Lens (Red) offers many upgrades at the same price (Integrated 1.4mp EVF, Swivel Screen, 460k screen, Grip for bigger lenses, faster focus performance, etc)For the same price, the newly announced G10 matches the E-PL1 with video, and new processing engine (cross your fingers for a JPEG improvement).  Additionally, it has a 2kp EVF (I'm not sure how useful that will be), a grip, a control wheel, a 1/4000 shutter speed and faster focus performance.  It does not have in-camera IS.For those planning on getting the EVF at some point or with an ~$200 greater budget, check out the newly announced G2.  Take the G1, add 720P 60/50fps video, an improved processing engine, a new dial to change focusing modes, touch screen controls that look to work as slick as an iPhone, and touch screen focus, and you have a really really nice full featured camera.Here is a quick and dirty list of pros and cons of the E-PL1ProsThe best Olympus implementation of the m4/3 sensorOne of the best JPEG engines in the businessRelatively small and lightBuilt in flashIn camera Image Stabilization(IS)Price (The cheapest m4/3 yet)Optional EVF (A very nice 1.4mp unit but very pricy at $279)Its availableNice build qualityConsSlow Autofocus (Panasonic has this figured out.

Lets get to the review.PROS:LightweightCompactFeels SolidFine Image QualityBuilt-in FlashSmooth Manual FocusingHD VideoUser FriendlyEasy to set Shutter speed, Aperture, and ISOThe camera is extremely lightweight without giving a \"cheap\" feel. Not as bulky as DSLR, but loads more customizable than a point and shoot. Nice build quality and construction. The large sensor allows for extremely elegant images. The built-in popup flash is great for  action shots and other things, but I suggesting bouncing the flash, or it may be too powerful. The manual focusing ring is extremely smooth and does not add any additional shake when shooting video. The video shot by the camera is 720p HD footage. It looks pretty good! The menu system is very easy to get accustomed to, and is simple enough for an amateur photographer. The mode dial on the top allows for easy access to aperture priority, shutter priority, art filters, ect.CONS:Kit Lens ZoomSlow AutofocusMacro ModeLow Light Performance?The stock 14-42mm kit lens that comes with the camera doesn't always provide enough zoom to get close to your subject, so I suggest buying a telephoto lens if you plan on taking pictures requiring high levels of zoom. My main concern in buying this camera, is that I read the reviews, and boatloads of people were saying the autofocus is very slow. Being an action sports photographer, this concerned me. The focusing time varies by condition. The autofocus is decently quick in broad daylight, but gets progressively slower as light is removed, exposure is changed, ect. Autofocus isn't as terrible as some of the other reviews make it out to be... but I keep mine on manual focus 90 percent of the time anyway. One thing that upset me about this camera is the macro mode. I love taking macro shots, and this camera absolutely refuses to focus at close range even with the macro mode on. The shortest focusing distance i have achieved is about 6 or so inches. This is a drawback because I am an \"in your face\" macro photographer who likes to get right up on the subject. Lastly, the low light performance is just okay. In lower light conditions the camera struggles to focus and the shots look grainy even with the ISO maxed at 3200.For more information, you should watch the DigitalRev review of the camera, it gives a lot of description as well as a street photography session.All in all, the Olympus E-PL1 is a good camera with a nice pricetag. I would recommend it to anyone seeking a portable and elegant camera.-Seymour", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good camera for its size", "Author": "Aman Gupta", "ReviewID": "R2BBQ54TP6FEDW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently bought this camera when my Nikon D40 took a dive in water (working now!) while I was on vacation and couldn't do without a camera. I chose this one because my girlfriend said she wanted a camera which takes better pictures in lower light (she had a canon compact), and so this has replaced her canon compact after the vacation.PROS:The best thing about this camera is its size. It's pretty small for a large sensor camera, and ergonomics are good. Its build quality is also decent - I've dropped it once on a hard floor, but everything works fine (did get a tiny dent though). It's controls are good for people using compact cameras, not so good for DSLR users - I would've really appreciated a dial to change aperture in A mode (or other settings).Image quality is about 80% as good as the D40 (taking kit lenses into the equation): I'm talking about 1) per pixel sharpness and 2) High ISO noise. Overall detail is obviously more, due to higher megapixel count. Auto White Balance is similar in both cameras - which means you cannot really trust it. Metering is accurate (similar to Nikon).Another thing which works very well is image stabilization. I've taken sharp handheld photos at 1/5s shutter speed with lens focal length set at 20mm (35m equivalent = 40mm) - which is a 3 stop advantage. This helps a lot.CONS:The worst part about the camera is the autofocus in low light. It's very difficult for it to lock focus in dimly lit restaurants, for example. It really needs a small light for illumination during autofocus. Only saving grace is that the manual focus implementation is good - you can set it to automatically zoom to 10x when you rotate the focus ring. In low light - using this is again difficult due to a very grainy image on the screen, but its better than nothing.As I've mentioned before - a dial will improve controls significantly. If you keep your camera in A/S/M modes and change settings frequently - then probably E-P2 is the camera to go for.Also, I tried to use the supplied software for RAW images and didn't like it. I use Lightroom normally, which works perfectly fine with its RAW files.TECHNIQUE FOR BEST RESULTS:1) Shoot RAW or set correct white balance during shooting. Bad white balance is a big source of bad photos - shooting RAW enables you to correct it later.2) As far as possible, set ISO to 200. If you use AUTO ISO, set maximum to ISO 1000. Since image stabilization is pretty good, you'll rarely need to go beyond this.3) Normally, use A mode, and set lens aperture to 1 stop less than max aperture. For e.g. at 14mm, set it f/4.5-5, and at 42mm set it f/8. The kit lens' performance peaks at these apertures.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Photos, just not quite DSLR IQ, but very close.", "Author": "Minnesota", "ReviewID":

Ususally whenever I take video clips with other cameras, there is that annoying wind noise, the sound on clips I have taken with this camera are clear, gotta love that!IQ is very nice out of this Olympus EPL-1 camera, even on auto with no adjustments.  I shoot with Nikon D200, D90 and D40 for most things, until now.  I love the Nikon DSLR's but have found sometimes I just don't want to drag them with, to heavy, lots of accessories, (filters, lenses, etc...) needed to capture the right shot.  In fact, I got the D40 because it is was one of the smallest, lightest DSLR's, but attach a nice zoon lens, and it still becomes cumbersome to carry to some events.  So I got this camera in hopes of feeling I could get excellent photos from a more portable device, and so far it has not disappointed.  IQ is not quite as good as the Nikon DSLR's I shoot with, but if you don't shoot with a DSLR you will be VERY pleased with the photo quality.  I have had several instances where my son had a wrestling match and you are moving quickly from mat to mat, and I didn't bring my DSLR because I knew it would be such a hassel. Or out of town at a baseball game, who wants to sit on the bleachers with the other parents and a large camera bag.  This camera tucks nicely in my medium sized purse even with an extra 45-200 micro four thirds lens.  It is so easy to have with for capturing shots, no need to lug around a DSLR.I have shot with a lot of point and shoots, some of which I still hang onto and use because of their excellent IQ (for a point & shoot), and convenience.  I have a Panasonic FZ28 and Canon SX200 and I wouldn't give them up, but this camera is a step up from those and my first choice (it is my go to camera)NOW!  Conveinent, check, HD video, check, lightweight and portable, check (at least compared to my DSLR's), excellent IQ, check, cool art filters to add whimsy to photos, check.  I think if you are moving up from a point and shoot you will be WOWED by the IQ, and anyone who shoots with a DSLR will feel it is great IQ for it's class, NOT DSLR IQ, but comes close, and in some instances, very hard to distingush between to similar photos taken with a DSLR and this camera.Just know that if you are stepping up from a point and shoot, you will probablly find yourself desiring an additional lens (for more zoom).  Switching them out is easy, and the micro four thirds lenses are much smaller and lighter then the four thirds lenses used on a DSLR, and even with a zoom lens on this camera, I have found it surprisingly lighter than I would have thought.  I purchased the Olympus 40-150mm Lens and a MMF-2 (I belive it was $200 for both bought as a kit here on amazon), and that will give you the additional \"zoom\" you need.I am enjoying using this camera on a daily basis, and when I travel next I am taking it and leaving the DSLR's at home.  I am confident in its photo quality, and I can just put it in my purse to go through security, instead of dragging my photo bag (which is huge and has 6 lenses in it, with multiple accessories), that bag will stay home next time.  I really think this will make my vacations more fun to shoot.  When I went to vegas last year, my DSLR stayed in the hotel most of the time, because I didn't want to lug it around even with just one lens on the camera and nothing else.  DSLR's just get to heavy after a while, and there is nowhere to put it decently when I was shopping, gambling, eating, etc... without having a camera bag with (just hate it when people go around all day with large cameras hanging from there necks, I'm just not into that).  When I went on a cruise, every time we got off the boat I took a little point and shoot with me for the same reasons, who wants to spend more time lugging a camera than enjoying the islands.  I am really happy that I will be able to bring this and just throw it in my purse, I carry that around anyways, what a delight to have a camera that takes great photos, and doesn't become like a 2nd child you have to watch and lug around!For shooting weddings and events, yes a DSLR will always be my goto camera,  but for everything else, it is the Olympus epl-1!  Too most individuals, you will find the photos are excellent and wonder why anyone would spend more, unless you expect to be making a living off your camera (photo journalist, pro. photographer, etc...),  stick with this and you won't even notice the difference, and your friends won't either.*****UPDATE*****October 21, 2010*****I have did some shooting recentely comparing the E-PL1 to my Nikon D200 (which I love dearly), and was surprised how closely I could get the E-PL1 to match image quality and sometimes be even better!  I use the enhance image color (it is the fist setting under picture mode), but eveyone has their preferrences.  I hadn't even though of matching the two because always felt the D200 would be obviously superior, but after some intense shooting this fall with the E-PL1, and seeing the results, I just thought I would try and match head to head taking the same shots and I after showing a few people to ask which they like better, I got mix results, because everyone says the images are just to close to pick which was better.  Just wanted to share as I am used to the wonderful image quality of the Nikon D200, and for the most part, you can't even guess which photo is from which camera (I have to write it on the back to keep it straight myself), no for me, that is impressive for this camera.", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Portable DSLR Alternative", "Author": "Glenn Z", "ReviewID": "R11RF8YYYOJ4XG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as an option to my Canon Rebel DSLR which I didn't use much due to its size.

Smith", "ReviewID": "R39NTIULGUFIMZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I should mention that I usually take pictures with my cell phone, and they are crappy, grainy, noisy, and or blurry 95% of the time.  I've also owned 3 or 4 cheapo point-n-shoot cameras over the last few years that have also taken (for the most part) crappy pictures.  Why?  Because I really only take pictures of my kids and they really don't like to sit still.  I've broken every one of those P&S; cameras, too, which is why I often resort to the cell phone.  Do you know how frustrating it is that all of your fancy-pants mom friends on facebook are able to post beautiful pictures of their kids every stinking day because they have their fancy DLSR's, while your only able to post a crap cell phone picture once or twice a month because you can never get a good one!  It's frustrating.Why did I decide to buy the Olympus E-PL1?  Because I've wanted a DLSR for years, but never could afford a decent one, and didn't want to spend all that money on a mediocre one either.  I also don't know the first thing about photography.  Not to mention...  have you seen the size of those monsters?  Sheesh.  I'm already carrying a baby, a daiper bag, and a purse everywhere I go.  I don't need a camera the size of a small dog, too.  I first discovered Compact Interchangeable Lens System cameras several months ago and have been reading reviews and watching prices ever since.  I finally got a great deal on the E-PL1 from Amazon Warehouse Deals and went for it.  I've had the camera for a few days now and I LOVE IT!For those of you who are used to taking pictures of wild, fast moving kids with cell phones or crappy P&S;'s and are upgrading for the first time, this review is for you!!!1.  Quality:  Pictures are crystal clear.  Even the pictures of fast moving kids and animals are clear as day.  I've been primarily using Auto Mode in my house at night where the lighting isn't that great.  Out of the few hundred I've taken so far, only a small handful have been a litte blurry.  I consider that a success, and there is no doubt in my mind that the blurry ones are a result of user error.  After an adjustment or two, the next pictures are clear again.  MUCH BETTER QUALITY THAN A P&S;!2.  Ease of use:  I find that this is just as easy, if not easier, to operate than a regular P&S.;  I can't compare it to DLSR's becuase I've never used one before.  I've read some reviews on here about the camera lacking a dial.  The E-PL1 definitely has a dial, so I think those poeple are reviewing the wrong camera.  To me, the digital menu is easy to use also.  Plus it has shortcut buttons that take you right the menu's you'd use the most (at last the ones I've been using the most).  And you can create your own custom menu.  After reading the manual once and messing around with it, I'm not finding it difficult to use at all.3.  Shutter Speed and Auto Focus:  Several reviewers have commented about slow shutterspeed and issues with autofocus.  Notice that they are downgrading from expsive DLSR's?  As far as I'm concerened, both shutterspeed and autofocus are pretty darn fast!  It takes a picture the instant I push the shutter button.  And it autofucses really quickly, even in low light (like inside a house at night).  As one reviewer mentioned, if it's really, really dim, it won't focus and therefore won't allow you to take a picture, even if the flash is turned on.  This has happened once, but I didn't find it to be a big deal.  The camera probably just saved me from taking a crappy, dark picture I'd delete anyway!  The autofocus on this camera is great for moving kids because it keeps adjusting as your kids are moving.  I've been getting seriously great shots.  It also has a continuous shutter mode, which will keep taking pictures as long as the shutter button is depressed.  I've gotten some great shots of the baby using that feature.  Another reviewer mentioned that this camera takes forever to write pictures to the SD card (which would obviously hold you up from taking your next picture right away... if that were true).  I'm calling bull-crap on that.  First of all, memory cards each have their own write speeds.  If you buy a cheapo memory card with a 15 MB write speed, its going to be slow!  If you suck it up and get a memory card with 35 MB write speed, it'll be much faster.  Trust me, it makes a difference no matter what camera you use and is totally worth the extra money.  I've been using a 16 GB card with 35 MB write speed, and it's fast as lightning.  I dont notice a lag at all before I can take my next picture.4.  Cool Features:  The camera has a bunch of Art settings that allow you to take photo's with different effects.  I have a jet black cat with yellow eyes, and for 8 years, I have never gotten a good picture of her.  She's so black, she just looks like a featurelss blob with yellow eyes.  I used the Sepia effect and have gotten THE MOST AMAZING pictures of her.  I can see every hair!  There are also 20+ different modes for settings like taking pictures of fireworks, or pictures on the beach.  I haven't gotten a chance to play with those yet but I intend to over the winter and then I'll update this review at some point.5.  Flash/Lack of Viewfinder/LCD Screen:  The pop-up flash is great!  I haven't noticed any issues with the LCD nor have I missed having a view finder.  If it's ever so bright that this becomes an issue, I'll probably just buy the electriconic viewfinder attachment.  I've seen good deals on Amazon already, they aren't that expensive anymore.6.  Size:  It's bigger than a P&S; and smaller than DLSR.  If you have big hands and a habit of dropping small electronics, such as cameras and cell phones, you will definitely appreciate the larger size and neck strap.  It looks and feels very old school and seems to be of solid construction.  It wont fit in your pocket, and with the lense attached, probably not your purse either.  I bought a small camera bag for it and I'm going to upgrade to a neoprene neck strap because when I'm out and about, that's where I'll want it so I can take pictures whenever I feel like it.  Although its bigger than most cameras, it is still portable enough to be taken and used everywhere without being cumbersome.I am also going to buy the E-PL1 for Dummies manual so that I can try to learn more about the custom settings and functions.  The user manual that comes with the camera is helpful, but since I'm not a photographer, I don't understand half of it.  All in all, I'm having fun learning with this camera, and maybe one day, when I get a couple grand to burn, I might invest in a nice DLSR, but until then, this totally suits my needs!  I LOVE IT!  And in case your wondering, I've been burning up facebook with all my fancy photographs!

The HS10 (30x !!!) gave sharp picture at near end, a little soft at far end of the zoom, excellent macro, but with bad low night performance. SX20is is bad in every area except video with auto focus (not sure why people gave it high rating!? SX30is picture is even worse). K-x's picture is Okay and is very good in low night performance (up to ISO 6400 with no flash!!) but can't auto focus in video. However they all failed my special test; they can not fit into my winter jacket pocket or my wife's purse. I really don't like to carry big camera for day to day casual shooting.Finally, I found Sony Nex 3 and E-PL1. The Nex 3 has very small body, very nice LCD, but the lens is much longer. Its lens is also proprietary. E-PL1 has bigger body (good size to me, heavier and feel very solid) and with a retractable lens (very smart!!). Picture by E-PL1 is also better than Nex 3. E-PL1 also has a build-in flash (I love it, it is bright enough for most casual pictures), a hot shoes (I need that for group pictures indoor), and better low night performance. It proofs that the bigger APC-S size senor in Nex 3 is not always better if its JPEG engine can not keep up. I did not try Penny CF1 because it is more expensive for its lens, no build-in stabilizer in the body, and its review is worse than E-PL1 for picture IQ.Picture of E-PL1 is so sharp that it revealed all the defect of my face. Ladies should be aware of this :-) Every picture is very sharp when zoom in on my computer. I am just using M-normal size setting in this camera. The size of each file is about 1.2MB and I can still crop out very nice smaller picture from it to print. It proofed more pixel is not always better, it just wasted more storage. I (and most people) usually only print 4x6 pictures!!All the iAuto, Arts and Scene modes are very usable!! Anyone from P&S; world can use this camera (like me). Yet, it has all other manual mode for the advanced users (a lot for me to learn). I posted a sun set behind tree picture here. There are also many options in the menu; more than the HS10, SX20is and K-x.I also like the Auto Focus with manual adjust mode. I can half-press the shutter button, let it perform auto focus, then use the manual focus ring to check. The LCD zoom into the center of the image for me to see. It is so easy!!!With HS10/SX20is/K-x, the camera can take macro picture at very close distance (almost touching) to the object. E-PL1 can not auto-focus if it is less than 6 inches away. But I can zoom to the object from there, so it is not a problem. Just something to get used to. I posted a few \"pink\" and \"red\" flower macro pictures here.The only thing I miss is a focus assist light so it can not focus in a dark room or dark night... E-PL1 also has hard time to take fast action picture. We know its LCD is hard to read under bright sun light, but I am always confident that it can take good picture every time even I don't see it well from the live view LCD. Its view finder is just TOO EXPENSIVE!! If the surrounding is very dark, the LCD shows lot of noise. I called the Olympus support; they pick up the phone right away. They said it is normal to see noise on the LCD in a room with very little night. I thought I had a defective unit....The video from E-PL1 is nice but it records the sound from the lens when I adjust the zoom lens. It does not auto focus until I half-press the shutter button. So I still need a camcorder. This camera allows me to take picture during video recording!!! The HS10 and SX20is can auto focus in video mode in my test. HS10 is so cheap; I may buy it again if I need to shoot at 30x distance during a sport game. It is much cheaper than buying a 14-150mm or 70-300mm zoom lens for this E-PL1 :-)I got my E-PL1 refurnished model via Amazon Market Place, the packaging is just okay but it is still like new. Now I need to save some $$$ for the 9-18mm lens (same cost as this camera!!!) and an external flash.When the E-PL2 is available, I will be one of the first buyer!!!

EPL1 handles like a a big point and shoot. If you are coming from a DSLR you will find this camera to be slow to respond and the settings difficult to change rapidly. However in my experience (coming from nikon Dslrs) the speed frustration is mostly due to old habits. Give this camera a chance, once you get used to how the camera handles the operation can be quite fast, though taking shots in rapid succession is not going to be this cameras strong suit.2.  The picture quality is very good. With the kit lens the pictures are sharp, have nice colors and show very little noise even at high ISO (as long as the shot is properly exposed).  You can't get close to this kind of sharpness and noise control from any of the point and shoot i have ever tried.3.  The camera takes great pictures in Auto Mode which is nice for when you hand the camera to someone else. However, the real pleasure of this camera is how customizable it is. In my mind this camera is best for someone who wants to learn photography and experiment, as the many available options will reward the user who is willing to spend some time with the manual. Lots of hidden gems in the menu, like wireless flash control and useful bracketing options.4.  Lack of focus assist lamp is a bummer, in very low light AF simply wont work.

Great Image Quality (IQ).I like the E-PL1 better than the E-P2 because it has a built in flash that can be bounced to the ceiling by holding it back with your finger and  you then get the benefits of a bounce flash in a relatively compact camera.The E-P2 is a work of art.  However the 2 wheels are confusing (as to when they do this or that) and the lower wheel is too easy to turn by mistake.  The E-PL1 control is clearer with its simpler digital oriented approach.That is ignoring that the E-P2 is $ 1100 vs $ 599 for the E-PL1.To capture the E-PL1's potential the Panasonic 20mm 1.7f lens is a must.  It creates professional pictures like a Leica.  It also lets the bounce trick work wonders.

The GF1 has a larger, high-resolution screen and speedier autofocus, especially in low light.  The e-pl's jpegs straight out of the camera are tack-sharp and have spot-on color.  Finally, to make up my mind I bought both cameras so I could test side-by-side.  The biggest revelation hit me when I put the panasonic lens on the olympus body and the huge difference in autofocus speed disappeared.  I'd had no luck getting good results out of the pansonic's raw image files, either.  Better image quality is a top priority for me.  As well, I personally LIKE the olympus menu system, there's an option you can turn on called \"super control panel\" where you can get to nearly every setting you need in one screen.  Besides that, there are so many customizable options you could play all day.  I also purchased the M.ZUIKO DIGITAL OLYMPUS 17mm pancake lens, and it greatly improves autofocus, gives me great pictures, and makes this feel like a slightly overgrown point-and-shoot.Now, this is my opinion coming from a mostly point-and-shooter perspective - someone who's looking for a ocmpanion to their dslr and is used the controls and fiddling with raw files might be more happy with the panasonic.

If you're shooting family & friends, you don't often have a lot of time to change settings, and the e-pl1's auto setting handles conditions very well. Its auto depth-of-field adjustment is spectacular (I have a picture of a bumblebee that is amazingly detailed, without distractions of background images).  If you choose to, you can set the camera to shoot jpeg AND raw, so if you have to edit the raw image, it's there, otherwise, you have a very well-produced jpeg.  I'm really glad not to be stuck with the gf1 where I am forced to post-process every single picture to get the quality I see in the e-pl1.  As well, I tried the panasonic 45-200mm OS lens on an e-pl1 recently and it was great.

Also, my price was $199.00 for the camera body and 14-42mm kit lens in refurbished but like new condition with free shipping and no tax. Just wanted you all to know what price point I'm reviewing from.My camera journey started a few years ago when I bought a Kodak Z1012, it was 10.1MP camera with a 12X zoom and 720p video.  I was happy with it but it was chunky and kind of cheap feeling, also the video was not the greatest and the on board mic was very weak.  Next I decided to up it a notch and pick up a Panasonic Zs7.  It was pocketable travelzoom camera with a 12X zoom, much better cleaner 720p video and good stereo mics.  The first thing I noticed was how soft the pictures were.  I tried everything to get some performance out of it, but my pictures always ended up looking bland and un-interesting, Also had alot of focusing problems, my old Kodak shot much sharper pics.  So on to the next camera.  Out went the Panny and in came the much more expensive Sony HX9v.  was sure this camera was the answer to all my problems.  It has a 16x Zoom, 1080p at 60fps video, Gps, 920,000 dot screen.  This camera has some great video!  Rivals many higher end camcorders, also has the best image stabilization I've ever seen.  Does pretty good video in low-light too.  Just one minor HUGE problem, the actual pictures are weak.  Really weak.  Every once in a while you might accidently get a picture that is almost decent, but that is rare.  The file sizes of these pics are tiny (no way they are true 16mp shots).  The pics are also off color, soft, and the de-focus feature I was so excited about is just a gimmick that almost never works correctly.  Also forget doing anything creative with this camera, their are NO built in filters besides plain black and white, and a very harsh looking sepia.  So why do I still have it?  it makes a decent pocket camcorder with a 16x zoom.  So with that all out of the way, I wanted something affordable that took really good pictures and I wanted it to be fun, because I've always wanted to do some creative street shooting.  Ran into a deal on the Olympus E-PL1 for $199.  Couldn't beleive this was about a $600 camera less then 2 years ago.  SO I looked up all the professional and consumer reviews I could find.  Learned why I should buy it, and why I shouldn't.  The mass majority of the reviews were favorable so I decided to give it a try. So glad I did, Best camera I've ever owned.  Learn to use the settings and your pics will be stunning.  That huge sensor makes a big difference over your average point and shoots.  I've shot animals, landmarks, lakes, rustic looking artistic shots.  Some of the photos look so good I can't believe I've shot them.  No photoshopping needed.  Comes with 6 built in art filters and damn do they work well.  Pin-hole, soft focus, and film grain are my favorites.  I also bought a cheap plastic Holga lens off ebay ($15) to really get some amazing vintage shots.  Get alot of compliments from friends and family on many shots. They also can't beleive what I paid, they think I'm using some kind of high priced rig. Camera offers pretty speedy shooting too.  Just make sure to have a fast SD card and to update the firmware.  720p video at 30 fps actually works pretty well.  I bought this camera for pictures so having decent HD video is just a bonus.

Here's the whole story though:I started off with a Panasonic Lumix DMC-GFKK3 kit.  It was okay, kinda nice to have a touchscreen for certain things; a burden for others.  The Panasonic cost me around $400 USD, which I would have been more than happy to pay except that the picture quality was so subpar it really gave me a heap big buyer's remorse.  Luckily, the place I purchased it at (not Amazon) has a decent return policy. I ended up taking it back right after I saw the Pen at it's quite reasonable price.The PEN arrived quickly with Prime, and as soon as I got it out and slapped an SD card into it, I snapped a few shots and sighed a huge sigh of relief.  The picture quality was exactly what I was expecting it to be, and far superior to that of the Lumix. I had spent hours playing with the Lumix to ensure picture quality settings and video settings were set up properly to no avail - the Pen is far superior in picture quality, hands down.Though the PEN lacks in the department of crazy features (like touchscreen and 3D capability), it excels in picture quality and (IMO) user-interface.  Olympus glass (lenses) are always pretty great too, though this kit came with an L series (plastic lens mount instead of metal) kit lens (which is fine for the price), the quality of the glass itself is still great.I paired this camera up with a compatible Eye-Fi card and it's been great so far!

In real life, I found myself leaving my full frame DSLR and 2 1/4 inch square reflex camera at home and packing a compact waterproof digital camera on trips. I got the pictures, but missed the quality images. This camera is small and light enough to take anywhere and the images are good enough for 16X20 prints. This may be due to the large size of the sensors. The in camera processing is good enough to shoot in jpeg, not raw, simplifying post image processing.  I use a binocular strap to carry this camera over my shoulder so that I do not feel like a tourist. This is reminiscent to me of hiding a 35mm rangefinder. The lens structure does wobble at telephoto focal lengths, but I mostly take images at wide angles of view. The LCD screen is fine for me, except in bright sunlight where the EVF may be a good addition. Buyers should know that this lens has a plastic lens mount so you are NOT getting the metal mount seen with the ED lens. This kit lens is the L ED lens. The camera has in camera image stabilization and dust control. Focusing speed is adequate outdoors.The built in pop up flash is a nice feature for occasional flash photography and fill.I am also shooting with the Lumix 20mm f1.7 pancake lens. I am happy with the images from this lens, but the Olympus does NOT support in camera lens aberration correction for this lens as seen when this lens is used on a Lumix micro 4/3 camera. Actually I don't think this is a big deal. The PL1 with this lens fits nicely in my jacket pocket, so no need to leave it at home. The lens is fast enough for available light, but the focusing is, IMHO, slow indoors. I am getting better pictures using available light in the Program Mode, choosing the ISO and using center focus only. So I focus in the center, and then holding my finger in position, reframe and then press my finger down fully to shoot. No question that I get better images with a full frame DSLR and 35mm f1.4 lens in available indoor light, but we are comparing apples and oranges here.I tend to hit the movie record button accidentally, but I have now trained my errant finger to avoid this button.I was surprised by the ease of taking indoor movies with this camera. The movies are in AVI format and it IS possible to get iMovie on the Mac to export the movie to .mv4 and iDVD to burn the .mv4 to DVD that can be opened by a standard stand alone DVD player. (Note that you can just rename .mv4 files to .mp4 since the encoding is identical. Some programs that do not recognize .mv4 will recognize the same file as .mp4. Go figure.)The battery charger uses a separate AC cord and is bulky for traveling. I am now using a compact battery charger with a built in AC plug for traveling.This sort of reminds me of fishing.

Instead, I take an advanced compact Lumix camera I picked up a year ago. It has higher resolution than the D80, and it's a lot handier. It occurred to me that the only real justification I had for keeping the SLRs was that I could use them with non-standard lenses, like pinhole lenses or my telescopes. But that doesn't have to lock you in to DSLRs anymore.All the major camera makers are coming out with a line of mirror less interchangeable lens cameras. Nikon has a new system, but it's not compatible with their old lens mount. That convinced me to look around a bit to see what else was on the market. Sony has a system that's been getting some acclaim, and Canon has a brand new system. But what what caught my eye was the \"micro 4/3rds\" standard cameras from Olympus and Panasonic. Two companies making lenses and bodies gives you some competition, and the cameras are fully compatible (with the proper adapter)  with the standard 4/3rds lenses made for larger DSLRs.I decided to try the system by just dipping a toe in, as it were, and ordered an Olympus PEN E-PL1. I didn't order the lens at first; instead, I ordered a handful of inexpensive adapters for T-threaded lenses, C-mount (cinema) lenses and manual Nikon lenses, so I could evaluate the camera with what I had on hand, and see how well it would adapt with things like telescope use. It only took me a day for fooling around to decided to go ahead and order the matching 14-42 lens as well.The Olympus E-PL1 is the entry model in Olympus' line of micro 4/3rds cameras, lacking some of the knobs and features of the E-PL2 and E-PL3. It doesn't lack in quality, however, and it can do things my Nikon D80 couldn't do, like autoexposure with an older, manual Nikon lens. I haven't attached it to my Questar telescope yet, but I'm looking forward to trying it. At a fraction of the weight of the D80 (and the F3 I used before that), the E-PL1 will be much easier to use with the Q. The lighter weight also means I probably won't need a counterweight.I'm happy enough with this camera that I decided to go ahead and pack all my Nikon digital gear and send it off to KEH for sale. I'm keeping my best older lenses, as they don't have a lot of resale value, and I think a lot of them will work great with the Oly- the 55/1.4 will be a great low light lens, I'll continue to use the Micro-Nikkor 55mm for nature photography, and the 300/4.5 should be an interesting one to try. Are the current cop of micro-4/3rds cameras as good as the top of the line, full frame DSLRs? No, but then, they don't cost $4,000, either. If you're thinking of buying one of the entry-level DSLRs like the D40 or similar Canons I suspect you'd be far better off with a micro 4/3rds camera.I'm pleased enough with this camera that I'm thinking about taking the cash from the sale of my Nikon gear and getting a second body, and perhaps a fixed wide angle lens, or a telephoto. Leading contender right now is the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GX1 16 MP Micro 4/3 Compact System Camera with 3-Inch LCD Touch Screen Body Only (Black), but I may go a bit simpler and buy a used DMC-GF1 if I can find a good deal.One added thought: If you're going to go to the trouble (and expense) of using a M43 or DSLR, for goodness sake, shoot in RAW mode! Yes, it takes up more space on your SD card than shooting in JPG, but so what? Memory is cheap today. You can get a good 16GB card for $16-20 that will hold more than a thousand images shooting in RAW at your largest image size. Shooting in JPG you lose resolution AND color information. If you wonder why your photos taken with your new camera don't have any more snap than those taken with your $120 point and shoot, switch to RAW mode and see the difference.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Stunning Photos", "Author": "Big-Z", "ReviewID": "R2Y294S5B4Q13H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned 32 digital cameras since 1992, and I must say the EPL1 is one of my favorites.

The lenses for it are really good, including the 14-42 that comes with it. I have also added the Zuiko 9-18mm f/4.0-5.6 ED Zoom Lens with adapter. I bought both the EPL1 and the 9-18 lens as supposed factory demos. Both have looked and worked like brand new. I love the combination for scenic shots. Since I paid so little for the camera with the 14-42 lens (less than most point and shoots), it would take a great deal of negatives for me to be disappointed, but I can say that if I had paid full price for this camera, lens combo, it would still be a great camera. The larger sensor makes a big difference in image quality and the image quality with this cam is consistent corner to corner. I never pick up my NEX-3 any longer even though it is a great camera.

This camera fits my need to move from point and shoot cameras to the interchangeable lens (ILC) world. I needed to take photos of jewelry to post online and was not pleased with the photos from my new 16MP point and shoot camera. I needed a camera I could manually focus and get great closeup shots. I did a lot of research and was reluctant to spend $500 and more for a single purpose camera. I, like most other shoppers, was focused on MP size thinking that would give me the quality photos I needed. Some of the reviews I've read mentioned larger MP size did not necessarily mean better photos. I had discounted the four-third cameras because most topped out at 12MP. I learned a great deal about the technology at four-thirds.org and decided to take a chance on the Olympus PEN E-PL1.I have been extremely pleased with the photos from this camera. The quality of the photos surpass those of my 16MP P&S; camera. The colors are as true as I've seen. My jewelry photos are coming out great. It is as easy to use as a point & shoot, but is much more capable. The iAuto setting is as simple as it gets, but as I learn more I am able to take advantage of the additional settings and take some really creative shots. This camera has opened a whole new world of photography beyond that for which it was originally purchased.This has been one of the best buys I have made in a long time and at less than $300 is a terrific bargain! The size of this camera is a plus. It is not much larger than a point and shoot camera, so I think most people would be more likely to take this camera vs a large DSLR camera.The only con is the price for additional lens. But with adapters you can use any of hundreds of lens out there. I was able to get a used 50mm f1.8 OM Olympus lens for $25 and an adapter for $23 and I now get great portrait photos with a nice soft background. The only trade-off is you must focus manually, but that is an easy compromise for the low price of a legacy lens.I recommend this camera if you want to move up from P&S; cameras at a low cost.", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great time to get into M4/3rd with this camera", "Author": "Charles \"Charles\"", "ReviewID": "R3O1WUL3SXBTVQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Until recently, I always thought of myself as a Nikon/Canon DSLR kind of guy.

It's priced approximately $250-300 below the cost of an EP-2 as is a Panasonic GF1.  The main differences are the E-P1's stainless steel construction, although the E-PL1 feels quite solid to me, EPL's 1/2000th sec. shutter speed compared to 1/4000th, a few less ART filters (meh), and arguably a less intuitive menu... if you that's the place you like to hang out a lot.Olympus recently released a 1.1 firmware update for all Pen series cameras to increase AF speed.  The difference now between the ever-compared Panasonic GF1 (.47) and the EP series (.7) amounts to about 1/5th of a second, nothing to complain about and imperceptible in reality.  In the film days this shutter lag time is about the same difference as a \"faster\" Leica M6 rangefinder and a pro level SLR, a fact that wasn't enough to stop people from buying SLRs. Even if you are so fine-tuned to sense a AF speed difference, you can always depress the shutter half-way first thus resulting in no shutter lag... OR manually focus... OR zone focus which is even faster.  Photographers should know, or at least learn how to go to plan B or C when needed.  The E-PL1 is a wonderful technical achievement dumbed down in a few areas, but still generally very sophisticated for the casual user. It is not a replacement for a DSLR, nor was it intended to shoot sports.When you are in the Panasonic Lumix GF1 camp it's all about AF speed.  Once that discussion is silenced most GFers fail to mention the E-PL1's in-body IS, nicer colors, a much better EVF, smoother manual focusing, a more quiet AF focus for HD audio, a stereo mike accessory, or better subject tracking. The Panny 20 f1.7 pancake is great, but it doesn't have IS thus your movies and arms-length shots, especially in low light, have the tendency to be slightly blurred.As for Lori Gruden comments from Cnet:  She seems to regularly give mediocre grades to the same highly reviewed cameras by other professional testers, even in opposition to those consumers who actually use the product she's nitpicking.  I believe she commented that Olympus should have got the E-PL1 \"right\" before it was released, not relying on firmware to fix their mistakes.  If that was the case Microsoft Windows, GPS devices, in fact all improvements to existing products would have to be purchased new again... sort of like the expensive way Apple markets it's products.Anyway, I like the E-PL1. It sure beats hauling the FF DSLR/lenses all over for casual photography. The 17 f2.8 pancake is very nice.  The kit lens is decent, but has a plastic mount.  I guess you shouldn't expect too much because it's included kit price works out to around $50 if you bought the body separately.  I will be purchasing a VF2 electronic viewfinder, and a 14-150mm MFT lens ($600) when it is released this summer.", "Date": "May 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love it now, but I hated it for a while.", "Author": "Hike & Bike", "ReviewID": "R1BOVM71ELOFTJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had packed this camera up 3 times to send it back.  I'm glad I didn't.  I honestly haven't had so much fun or freedom with a camera, but getting to that point wasn't easy for me.I've owned my fair share of DSLR cameras and figured it would be an easy conversion.  It wasn't.  I was frustrated and I agree with the reviewer who cautions about being honest with your priorities.  I think I was expecting too much.  This camera won't do everything, but it does a lot.  There are a lot of features that I love.  I especially like the screen magnification on manual focus, GENIUS!I think this camera was mis-represented as a camera for the masses and not so much for the serious photographer.  I have taken more pleasing travel, fine art, and portrait images than I have in a long time.  Perhaps its just because the camera goes with me everywhere and I'm shooting way more.I was a bit disappointed with the kit lens.  Optically its fine, however there is no lens shade and its difficult to attach filters.  I purchased a used Panasonic Lumix 14-45 because it addresses those issues.  As an added benefit the Lumix has in-lens stabilization which I find superior to the in-camera stabilization when using the camera for video.  If I'm using the kit lens for video, I just turn off the stabilization.Lastly, for Lightroom users, I was frustrated with developing the RAW files in LR3.  After some experimenting I found that if I re-set my preferences to default the blacks to zero it made a tremendous difference when there are dark areas.  I found that the dark areas tended to block up badly with the previous default of 5 for the blacks.  I also made custom tone curves which began with the medium and strong contrast curves.  I modified both curves by lifting the left most point (the on in the bottom corner) just a tiny bit up the vertical axis.  These also make a huge difference in preventing the blacks from blocking up.Enjoy the PEN, its awesome.

My previous photography experience had been limited to a variety of cell phones and an aging Canon S2 IS. To say that this upgrade was somewhat of a revelation would be an understatement. Even with the kit lens, the quality of the photos was light-years ahead of my previous cameras. After approximately 15,000 pictures I sold it and moved up to the E-P3 and just recently purchased the OMD.PROS:While the sensor and capabilities of the E-PL1 have been surpassed by newer micro-four-thirds cameras, I was very pleased with the output of this camera. JPG's are punchy and vibrant without looking fake. I was comfortable shooting up to ISO 1600 for low light shots. I also own an E-P3 and prefer the noise profile of this camera.The burst rate of 3 frames per second is good for a camera of this class (and for 2010). Paired with some high quality lenses, the photos you can produce from this camera can be stunning. I have used it extensively with the Panasonic 20mm f1.7 and Panasonic-Leica 25mm f1.4 lenses. The camera almost becomes a brand new device when you add some good glass. Lenses like this will provide some fun depth-of-field (not as much as larger format sensors), and hugely improved low-light capabilities.From an aesthetic point of view the camera exudes retro charm when viewed from the front. The hand grip is deep enough and makes holding the camera much more manageable.The on-board flash is handy if you need one. I rarely use it, but the ability to turn the flash upwards for bounce-flashes is handy.Battery Life-Even though the official battery life rating is 330 shots, I could easily get 600 shots per charge. I never use the flash and don't let the camera sit idle. Of course, using the flash and letting the camera stay on when not in use will probably get you closer to the official rating.The camera is full of settings, options, and features. Even after a year of using the E-PL1, I didn't touch everything. The art filters are fun, though I rarely used them. I relegated 90% of my usage to the S and A modes.CONS:Even though the front of the camera exhibits a retro (albeit boxy) design, the rear of the camera feels very cheap. The buttons seem flimsy and the recessed screen is low res.At the time, I was happy with the performance of the kit lens, but now, after owning half a dozen native lenses, I feel that the first-generation kit lens for the Olympus MFT cameras is their worst lens by far. First, the mount is plastic and after a lot of usage the lens will wobble a tiny bit in the mount. The focusing elements are not internal and during video recording, the focusing can easily be heard. At certain shutter speeds (160-200) it seems that the shutter causes the elements to vibrate causing some small amounts of blur. I highly recommend picking up the newer kit lens sold with the E-PL2, E-PM1, E-PL3, or E-P3 over this kit lens.The other major negative concerning this camera are the controls. Due to the lack of any dials, quickly changing settings can be somewhat cumbersome and even after using the camera for a year I still missed shots because I couldn't change key settings quick enough.Some may find the top shutter speed (1/2000) limiting. If you have a fast lens and want to use it in sunlight, this might be an issue, but even 1/4000 is often too slow for fast lenses. I would recommend an ND filter instead.SUMMARY:A fun camera that can produce quality images with good glass.

Even though the unit is not much bigger than some point and shoots, the larger-format four-thirds sensor produces images that even the best point and shoots may have to work hard to match, and the numerous control options can provide a level of customization to match mid-range DSLRs.One drawback may be that Olympus hasn't developed too many lenses for their micro four-thirds line. While Panasonic has a number of lenses for their micro four-thirds line that will fit this camera, they have their IS mechanism in the lenses instead of the body like Olympus, which may explain what appears to he higher prices for Panasonic lenses.While this camera has a built-in pop-up flash, unlike some of the other Olympus micro four-thirds cameras, it appears this camera will work with older Olympus dedicated flashes. For those who own these older flash units, it may open up a whole new set of possibilities. Of course, if someone wanted to use the camera's built-in flash unit to trigger remote flash units, which is not something one would find in many point and shoots, they can buy the newer R-spec Olympus flashes.In conclusion, this camera can be a compelling value for specific shooters, particularly those who don't mind getting used lenses on Amazon.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beware the cost of lenses and accessories", "Author": "sub_c", "ReviewID": "R3V2GW0FEOWZXK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Chances are if you bought an E-PL1, you're a bit more enthusiastic about photography than the average point-and-shooter. I bought the PEN E-PL1 not just for its compact performance, but also for its price. As I used my E-PL1 and in the process learned a bit more about photography, I found that it needs more in order to achieve the image I desire. However, lenses and additional accessories are expensive! Of course, you don't have to purchase these items, but you'll miss out on the true capabilities of the E-PL1 and on some awesome pictures.The included kit lens simply cannot give you the shallow DOF that you need for the blurred background effect or \"bokeh,\" and the fast shutter speeds that you can achieve with wider aperture. However, a lens like the popular Lumix G 20mm f/1.7 costs more than than E-PL1! (But I guess that's true of most m4/3 systems)Electronic viewfinders are also quite expensive. Composition is just not the same with the LCD screen, especially when it's too bright outside and you can't even see it properly. Looking through the viewfinder also has the added benefit of stabilizing the camera as you hold it against your head.External flash isn't as big a deal. With a little ingenuity, you can DIY a diffuser, which would make the pop-up flash more useful. However, if you want to get creative with your photographs, you'll find yourself needing an external flash unit, which are also expensive.I rate the E-PL1 body four stars; five if the In-body Image Stabilization actually worked or if the controls were more user-friendly.

If you are reading this then you are probably experiencing the same dilemma that I went through.Let me start by stating that I know very little about photography. I am one of those normal guys snapping at things in the street, taking family photos and taking holiday pics. I do enjoy looking at nice pictures though I dont want all the hassle.I wanted to move up from my excellent compact P&S; (Fuji 200EXR) but was in a dilemma over what to buy. The pictures the Fuji produced had gotten me more interested in photography but did I want to commit to a buying a Carrera or an SLK? I wanted something that could produce better image quality and do those blurry backgrounds like you see in magazines.Some friends told me to buy a DSLR but I already had a film SLR bought 15 years ago that I hardly ever used. It was just too heavy and bulky for me to enjoy carrying around my neck for long periods of time. I must had gotten through 10 rolls of film in those 15 years. They also told me that the lens included in the kit wasnt that good so I had to factor in another $300-$400 for extra lenses.I also considered \"Superzooms\" like the Panasonic FZ35 - but then the picture quality might just the same as my Fuji (or perhaps worse) as the sensor is half the size of the Fuji F200. They were also not that small - certainly not trouser pocket size. And what was I going to zoom in on? Taking pictures of the neighbours cat might be fun for a while but how often would I really use that much zoom?Then I found out about these little micro 4/3 babies. I must admit that it was a hard choice between the Panasonic GF1 and this one. I liked the feel of the GF1 more and the screen was better. However, as a novice photographer I wanted the security of in-body stabilisation which the Panasonic didn't have.I also didnt want to bother with \"post-processing\" using Photoshop (something my DSLR friends seemed to enjoy) and everyone (and the reviewers) said that the Olympus produced the best JPEG output straight from the camera of the two. Even better were the art filters - the grainy film and the soft focus especially. There is even a \"blurry background for dummies\" control with just two clicks!The last clincher was the price... the Olympus was $200 cheaper. The Panasonic was the about same price as the Canon 550 DSLR.Weighing up the pros against the cons the EPL-1 was the best choice for a guy like me - a novice photographer on a budget.", "Date": "May 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good for pros and intermediates", "Author": "K. Adele", "ReviewID": "R2K8WHTI2GCKZQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera can be used by pros, gifted amateurs and intermediates alike. It is fine for beginners who are serious about becoming good photographers. Beginners who are looking for a P&S; with interchangeable lenses will be unhappy, because you need to know something -- not alot -- about photo basics that go beyond pointing and shooting.One of its great attractions is that if all you want is a high-quality, low cost SLR, you can have it by buying the base model at a fantastic price with the kit lens (an unbelievable $260 for astonishing technology). Basically, this option provides you with an upscale P&S; at an unbelievable price.If you are serious about becoming a decent photographer, you don't work with LCD displays -- you want a viewfinder, which will cost an additional $250. So the camera now costs $510.The quality of pix with the 14-42 kit lens is okay, but not in the same league as what I get with my Nikon D7000 or my unbelievably sharp Fuji X100. If you want really clear shots that win awards in photo contests, then you must pay an additional $500 bucks for a Panasonic Lumix pancake lens -- 20mm, with an impressive f1.7 aperture. (Note: 20mm with 4/3 = 40mm with standard 35mm cameras) You have now reached the $1,000 range, and have a decent, light weight camera that might win you a prize or two in photo contests. Important note: If what you want is a walk around camera, get the fixed lens Fuji X100 for $1,200. The crispness of its photos would impress Ansel Adams.If you are going to shoot tigers and such at a distance, then you need to spend another $300 for a 40mm-150mm telephoto lens (equivalent to 80mm-300mm in the 35mm world). Your now $1,300 camera can get decent results with this lens. Personally, if I want good telephoto shots, I will lug my larger Nikon D7000 to get crystal clear shots of the lion taking down the zebra at 500 meters. Telephoto shots on the E-PL1 may win you a prize if you get a unique shot, but they won't give you the clarity you get with larger CMOS cameras.The big secret with the E-PL1, for those who want near professional level performance, is the 9mm-18mm wide angle lens ($500-$600). Wow! Great results: 90% of what I get with my Nikon D-7000 with a wide angle lens. In looking at reviews of this camera, I haven't see comments of this great capability. Check out newspaper photos and advertising photos: most are wide angle. That's what the pros use. The tiny Olympus with a 9mm-18mm lens can give you fantastic, crystal clear wide angle photos.Here's the configuration I suggest for the prospective E-PL1 buyer. Buy the standard camera (with kit lens) for $260. Pay an additional $250 for the viewfinder. Spend $500 for the Lumix high-performing, 20mm f1.7 lens. Finally, buy the wide angle 9mm-18mm lens for $500-$600. Total cost: $1,600 for an extremely light weight camera system that will get you great photos.But, if all you want is an SLR upgrade to your P&S;, spring for the measley $260 for the basic camera, which gives you a great camera that you may want to upgrade, as you develop your photo shooting skills.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Small Wonder", "Author": "David L. Moore \"David Moore\"", "ReviewID": "R17NM6MI8P8R9C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Mainly, I was interested in this camera because of its small size and high definition (12.3MP).  In terms of the high definition, I wanted a camera capable, as is the PEN E-PL1, of saving photos in RAW format which allows for maximum leeway in using computer software to adjust brightness and color of the photos while maintaining sharp focus.  I am pleased that the 14-42mm zoom kit lens is capable of very sharp images with nice color.  The zoom equals 28mm-84mm in 35mm-equivalent terms and so provides an ample gamut of zoom for most photographic work.  The f/3.5 maximum aperture is not as open as some might wish, but it is capable of capturing bokeh; and, for those who want a lens with a lower f-stop, there are other lenses available for this camera at an added price.In terms of size, being a mirrorless digital camera, the PL1 is small enough to be relatively unobtrusive.  It comes with a strap that is quite adequate which attaches to each side of the camera so that it may be carried around the neck.  But it is compact enough that I decided to attach a wrist loop to one of the brackets for the strap; I found that I could easily carry it in one hand that way while the wrist loop provides security to keep it from being accidentally dropped.  With the 14-42mm zoom lens attached, it would be difficult to carry in a pocket; but with the shorter, 17mm lens (available separately) it could easily be slipped into a pocket or purse.  I purchased a small camera bag which fits the camera with the kit lens attached and leaves room to carry another lens or the battery-charging equipment which comes with the PL1.I have only a few complaints.  The battery takes a good long while to recharge, so I will either have to plan ahead and have a charged-up battery whenever I plan to take the camera along.  Otherwise I could shell out for a second battery (proprietary, of course) and always have a charged battery on hand.  I also found a problem in focusing the camera in low light.  I was doing a 3-second exposure with a tripod, and I found that the LCD monitor on the back of the camera provided no definition at that light level; even putting the camera on autofocus did not help.  I didn't try illuminating the scene with a flashlight; that might have worked.  What I did was take about 20 shots at progressively incremental focus; that did produce at least one well focused photograph.  There are external flashes available for purchase which provide illumination for focusing; they can be attached by hot shoe.  In bright sunlight it can be hard to see the LCD on the back of the camera.  But there are viewfinders available for purchase which attach to the camera's hot shoe.  Reviews on their functioning are mostly positive.  Since all of my complaints can be addressed by purchasing additional equipment, I have not hesitated to give the Pl1 the best rating, especially since the basic price of the PL1 seems to me very reasonable for this very capable camera.I have used this camera for about 2 weeks mostly in manual mode and am very pleased with the spot-on focusing and exposure it achieves.  On the occasions I have used the auto mode the photos have also turned out very well.  The boot-up of the program upon turning the camera on is very quick.  And the shutter button, while not instantaneous, is very rapid for a digital camera, at least in manual mode which is how I have mostly used it.  It has a built-in flash that can be flipped up which is adequate as a fill flash on short- to close-medium-range shots.  The software that controls the camera allows for a wide range of options.  Certain buttons can be programmed to various functions.  I found that programming a button to make the LCD show how the shot would appear in black & white can be very helpful.  The four-thirds format is new to me as I'm used to working in two-thirds format, but with 12.3MP there is plenty of room to crop to the shape and size the photographer wants, and the four-thirds format, just as it comes out of the camera, fits very well on an eight-and-a-half by eleven inch sheet of photo paper.  There are cameras that can capture higher resolution, but the biggest paper my photo printer handles is 13 by 19 inches, and I can print at this size without any noticeable grain.To sum up, I have found the Olympus PL1 to be a versatile camera, capable of seriously good quality photographs all in a compact package.  I am happy with my purchase, and I feel I have received a great deal of camera for the price.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy, trouble free, NOT for people wanting total manual control", "Author": "opdoc \"opdoc\"", "ReviewID": "R3OQ6DQENYZUA2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:Fantastic picsEasy to UseLive View like Point and ShootiAuto works 99% of the timeSCN mode actually is usefulCarefree photographyAwesome pic quality for someone used to Point and Shoot qualitySo light in weight (as light as certain megazoom Point and Shoot cameras)Easy to lug around (compact size)RAW shootingCons:Manual control buttons absentLow light focus huntingMay need a pancake lens for quick focus in low lightScene modes have a delay after snap taken for processingHaving used the camera for more than a month now, it is a joy.

Image quality is fantastic, and you can pair it with some really top-notch Micro 4/3 lenses.  The Olympus 45mm f/1.8 and the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 primes are both really fantastic.  The 14-42 kit lens itself is not bad at all, though it's not a very fast lens at f/3.5.  And the real kicker is the price -- at just over $250, this is cheaper than mid-to-high-end point & shoots, and a couple hundred bucks cheaper than even the entry level DLSRs.  It's a full-fledged interchangeable-lens camera that competes with DSLRs on image quality, and point-and-shoots on price!This camera does have its drawbacks.  For one, auto-focus speed is slow -- you'll notice this mostly if you're shooting moving subjects, not so much otherwise.  Also, full manual controls are there, but a bit hard to access -- the dials and on-screen menus needed to manually adjust settings are a bit clunky; the camera is really designed for the person who will spend 90% of their time in automatic mode.

Driver", "ReviewID": "R1M0BV7X5SQXIZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to be an avid film photographer in high school and college, but dropped it years ago.  Since then, I have had a series of adequate-to-downright disappointing point/shoots - the most recent is a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ4.  So I decided to treat myself to a new camera, and after much research, decided on the E-PL1 based on a combination of budget, capability, and quality.  After a few days of use, I'm very pleased with almost all aspects of this camera.PROS:-RAW mode - this is my first camera with this mode, so I can't really compare, but based on many of the reviews, the RAW images out of this camera have low-light/high-ISO noise levels that rival SLRs with larger sensors.  I must say being able to shoot in RAW mode and edit in the included \"ib\" software* surpasses all my expectations.  Being able to forget about white balance, exposure compensation, etc. and correct later takes a lot of the guesswork out of shooting - I've taken several shots in mixed lighting conditions and made them pop simply by applying accurate compensation, where doing so to a JPG would provide suboptimal results.  I've done some full-pixel crops that don't look half bad, and I chalk it all up to being able to shoot in RAW mode.-Noise levels are very low.  I've taken many low-light shots at ISO 800 or 1600 that look very decent - what noise there is looks more like film grain when viewed at reduced size or printed out, rather than the artifacting I've gotten out of my previous shooters.  The Panny I'm coming from for instance would introduce so much color noise in low-light shots anywhere above ISO 400 so as to make any shots unusable for anything but Facebook posts.-The video is incredible.  I thought he HD video out of my smartphone looked good, but this looks amazing.  Even though it's *only* 720p, on my 1080p 46\" flat-screen, it looks outstanding.  I would even say that with a good (read: better than the kit) lens, this could be a credible (and super-cheap) starter camera for a film student or documentary maker (as long as you don't need to shoot a scene longer ~7 minutes due to the 2GB limitation).  The auto-focus hunts a bit, but a light touch on the shutter button and judicious framing will minimize this, and you can always focus in manual mode if necessary (though you can't switch focus mode - or anything - while filming).  I have a couple relatively minor complaints about video recording, addressed in the CONS section below, but both of which one can easily work around.-Size - this is a perfect size, heft, and shape, for me at least.  I can even shoot for a while one-handed without much fatigue - there's a raised \"safety bump\" to prevent you from inadvertently hitting the Movie Mode button, and with my thumb braced just beneath this, I can get a pretty good balance for a few shots, something that was not very easy with my old Canon AE-1 and Pentax K1000.  Even though it's got a plastic body, it's very well put together.-The built in flash is a convenience I'd never had in an SLR before.  And while, like any built in flash, it's only useful to a few feet away, the color balance is quite good, and it doesn't lead to blown highlights.CONS-The biggest con is the kit lens, although for such a great price I shouldn't complain, since it would be impossible to find a quality lens for the delta between the kit and body only prices.  The optics seem decent enough, although soft around the corners when zoomed in, but the barrel has a bit of play both in wide-angle and telephoto positions.  This means if you shoot at certain speeds between around 1/80 to 1/200, the shutter movement can rattle the lens, causing a slight blur, although if you shoot in the middle of the zoom range, this is less likely to happen, since the lens is retracted and has less play.  .  To be fair, this will only be noticable very close up, so for small prints and web sharing, it shouldn't be noticeable - if you want crystal-clear full-size prints, get better glass.  Next big investment of mine will be some quality optics.-As mentioned above, there are a couple minor drawbacks with video recording.  1) The in-body microphone will pick up the zoom and auto-focus noises from the lens.  This can be qutie distracting, and if you plan on doing a lot of recording, the Olympus SEMA-1 external mic adapter is highly recommended, as it should isolate the mic from the lens motor and solve this problem - this will be my next purchase**.  2) The video sizes in the Motion-jpeg/AVI format are HUUGE.  A 3 minute-long video took almost 750 MB - at this rate, I will need a lot of SD cards.  The good news is that the video compresses down quite nicely to more familiar and compatible formats without much loss in quality - I used Handbrake to compress this video from 750 down to 310 MB in size, with a negligible-to-nil difference in quality (h.264 format, High Profile with Constant Quality set to RF 15 and audio set to pass-through).  I would highly recommend becoming familiar with Handbrake or similar transcoding tools if you plan on using this for video recording.-*While I love being able to edit RAW images, the provided software is a bit slow and cumbersome to use.  This may simply be a limitation of editing RAW images since they are so large, but the interface could use some polish.-**The mic accessory attaches to the hot shoe, and blocks the connection, so you won't be able to use any other accessories like the optional viewfinder or a flash.  Not a big issue for me, but if you plan to do a lot of mixed-mode shooting, go for a model with an external mic connector onboard.-The only other complaint I have is that some of the default settings on this camera are buried in the setup menus, and perhaps should have been covered upfront in the user guide.  For instance, in Manual Focus mode, there is the option to zoom in to a magnified view as soon as you rotate the focus ring.  This is quite handy, and *should* be the default setting, but it took a lot of hunting through the manual and a couple layers of menus to turn this on.", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best interchangeable lens camera for the price", "Author": "SeaDav", "ReviewID": "R3VRYTUQKA1K5G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you are willing to invest some time understanding how to work with this camera, it can provide excellent results. There is a lot of customization available to tweak the picture quality and the user interface.I like:- Excellent image quality, probably due to the weak low pass filter. Images are crisp and details are kept even at 100% magnification. You can completely disable noise reduction (this is rare with other camera brands). You can also configure sharpening, color, etc  ...- Jpegs are greats.- Image stabilization is independent of the lens: it can be used with legacy manual film lenses. However it is not perfect (see below).- Can use really cheap but excellent manual focus film lenses (see keh) with an inexpensive adapter. I tried a 50mm (100mm with the m4/3 sensor) F1.7 Minolta Rokkor lens and it is giving fantastic results! Maybe because the lens was created for a bigger sensor (the m4/3 sensor is half the size of a film) there are very few distortions. This is way better that the kit lens.- The body shape is great and provides a good hold.I dislike:- No HDR capability :-(. Bracketed shots are limited 3 shots at 1 EV (e.g. 3 EV max range). Exposure can be changed manually but it is too slow to capture even slowly moving scenes in HDR. Cannot understand this limitation ??!- Image stabilization leaves a blur at all shooting speeds with the default settings, even at faster speeds. After experimenting and searching the web, using the anti-shock =1/8s  (buried in the menus) seems to solve the issue. When shooting with enough light, it is better to disable Stabilization.- Screen is not sunlight readable and it attracts fingerprints. This is solved with a screen hood.- The camera zooms up to 14x to help with manual focus in full screen. This works but makes composition tricky. When taking portrait shots, zoom in at a face feature (e.g. eyes, nose, ...) and quickly go back to full scene view to confirm composition, then go back to refocus and take the shot (you can re-assign a button to switch back and forth). I much prefer the picture in picture system used in Canon compacts which let you do both at the same time.- Autofocus is slow, and degrades in low light, but it is not worse than other brands of mirrorless cameras.No camera is perfect, but if you are looking for an inexpensive camera with pro level results, this is the best model available in my opinion. The image quality is exceptional for the price, but only if you know how to use the camera (not just from a photography angle, but from a feature tweaking point of view).

On the auto setting the focal length is too tight for most flowers to come out sharp allover the flower you are focusing on.

I decided that reviews always have to be taken with a grain of salt, so I ordered it.I love this camera, it's fun to use. The autofocus is fine.. It's not a DSLR and so it doesn't perform as well as a high end camera would. However,  after updating to firmware 1.1 the autofocus works pretty well. I am a little disappointed that it doesn't have an AF Lamp. That would have improved low light performance greatly.. But i guess you can't have everything.I think like a previous reviewer said, you need to be honest about how you will use the camera and what your expectations are. For me, this camera is a gem, but i'm not a pro looking for exceptional results. I just want to snap a few great pictures and have some fun.Most of my images are of animals - i.e. Dogs and cats. The camera is just fine for this. I know some reviews say otherwise. However, as any pet owner or parent knows animals and kids are unpredictable. There is no guarantee of a perfect shot with even the highest end camera. When photographing active and rambunctious subjects, it's partly about knowing your subject and partly luck.  For it's class. this camera does pretty darn well.I have also read that people thought the camera felt flimsy and cheap because it was mostly plastic. That's simply not true. It feels no less plastic than any DSLR. Honestly, it's heavier than I imagined and built like a brick - very sturdy. Unless you are just really rough on your gear, I can't imagine this camera falling apart on you.. even with everyday use.Some say the flash isn't that powerful, but this camera seems to do a good job in lowlight situations. It would do even better in low light with the 20mm panasonic lens or with a faster manual focus lens. I , myself, am using a 50mm 1.8 lens from an old film camera. As far as the flash, it's still pretty bright. You are after all trying to take a picture, not make your subject  blind.The art filters & multi exposure options are a lot of fun. I can't wait to get some more lenses ( such as a lensbaby)  and go out into the world with them. My favorite is the grainy B&W; with the Diorama mode being second. If you have doubts about the art modes, you can always shoot in Jpg + raw and get the best of both worlds.I am only giving this 4 stars because i DO wish it came with an EVF. I think it's silly that i have to pay almost $200 more for this very basic feature.  I wish it had stereo sound like it's big sister the e-p2 as well.Also as a Mac user, I am a little disappointed the included software isn't compatible. It took me a few minutes ( due to bad links on the Oly website) to find the OM2 software ( I will only use for panoramas, personally).", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Premium Image Quality in a Compact Size", "Author": "pveman", "ReviewID": "R21TYW2F9W5IVV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been shooting with a Canon 20D SLR for 5 years and during that time I've been looking for a camera that I could fit in my pocket that could get essentially the same image quality.  I went through several P&S; models and was ultimately disappointed in all of them.  I was very excited when I saw new micro 4/3 models so I decided to buy the E-PL1.  I have to say I am quite satisfied.In my opinion, the most important thing about a camera is image quality.  From that perspective, the E-PL1 is a truly outstanding camera.  The jpeg images coming out of the camera are significantly superior to what I get out of the 20D SLR. It is important to note, however, that the RAW files from the 20D can be processed to look slightly better than the E-PL1 jpegs.  But most people I know would rather have 95% of the image quality straight out of the camera than needing to fiddle with post processing.  The E-PL1 images are much cleaner than my Fuji F100FD.The pop-up flash is an nice added bonus.  You can actually manually aim the flash at the ceiling to create a softer \"bounce flash\" which provides much more even lighting than \"direct flash.\"  It makes a big difference.Video quality is another bonus in this camera.  It's a little more challenging to use than P&S; user will be used to.  Because of the larger sensor in this camera, it is capable of a much narrower depth of field.  While this leads to much more \"natural\" photos and videos, it also means that you need to be much more careful about keeping your subject in focus.  This can be a challenge for moving subjects in video - especially since the focusing on the E-PL1 is a little sluggish.  However, if you take a second to pre-focus the camera by pressing the shutter button down half way, you can get your subject nicely in focus.  Although the mechanical image stabilization does not work during video shooting, the camera does use an electronic substitution.  It's not as good, but as a former professional videographer I can testify that it is definitely better than nothing.  I have no problem holding the camera steady for must video shots.Speaking of the mechanical image stabilization, this feature leads to one of the greatest uses for this camera - low light shooting without a flash.  Because the image stabilization is in the body, you can attach a prime lens with a wide aperture and shoot indoors in low light with moderate shutter speeds.  Add in that the photos look so good up to 1600 ISO and you can get some remarkably clear hand-held pictures in low light.  I absolutely love the natural light pictures I have been able to take.  Keep in mind, however, that the auto-focus struggles in really low light.  But it has generally worked for me and the manual focusing is pretty easy to use.Overall, the camera is a terrific value for the price.

Mullins \"Book to Book\"", "ReviewID": "R35W3WUXWAIK46", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the E-PL1 to replace my canon G10 as my every day walk around camera.  The G10, while a wonderful camera, can't be used much beyond ISO 400 because of the noise levels produced by its small sensor.  The E-PL1 exhibits very little noise even at ISO 1600.  The focusing, while slower than a traditional dSLR, is fairly quick and is noticeably quicker than my G10. There are a couple of omissions from the E-PL1 that might make this camera undesirable for a select group of photographers.  First, there is no cable release available for the E-PL1 and, according to the Olympus representative I spoke to, there are no plans to introduce a cable release for this model.  Second, there isn't a focus assist lamp built into the E-PL1 which makes auto focusing in extremely low light impossible.  Finally, if you plan to use the E-PL1 outdoors in direct sunlight get the VF-2 electronic viewfinder; the LCD screen is difficult to see in direct sunlight.  Overall, I'm extremely happy with my E-PL1.  It produces great images in line with my Nikon D90 while being closer in size to my Canon G10.5/10/10 Update:The motor in the 14-42 lens is not powerful enough to use a Cokin P-Series filter system.  I thought I would be able to take advantage of the Cokin filters I already own, however with the Cokin filter holder attached the focus keeps hunting and eventually refuses to work at all; I can still use the Cokin system with the E-PL1 in manual focus mode.5/17/10 Update:The battery life is not great.

Fletcher \"seminolewind\"", "ReviewID": "RIRZJGJ40G3B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera, a canon t2i, and a panasonic fz200 .  I used them all with and without a tripod, mostly on animals, bugs, and nature.  Out of the 3, I kept the Olympus.The panasonic fz200 was awesome.  Fun to use and took great pics.  The canon I was a bit disappointed in, mainly the autofocus time, and inconsistent auto color.  Maybe these things are beyond how much I have to fiddle with a camera.I took pictures with all of them, freehand and with tripod, and at home on the computer, I could not tell the difference in quality.  The Olympus has 12.3 megapixels, and the canon has 18, and I expected to be able to blow up and crop the canon pictures much more, but could not.  The pictures fell apart at the same enlargement as the other 2.  The panasonic was outstanding even without a tripod.  But those 2 were not any better then the Olympus Pen epl-1.  The other reason I chose it over the Panasonic is that I have to turn the lens itself for closer/farther, where the panasonic had a toggle.  Hand on lens is far more quick and controlable when it comes to getting the distance you want.  I did not find that the autofocus took too long, but longer than my pocket camera.  With the canon, I more often missed the picture waiting for the autofocus to focus.I am not a professional.  But I enjoy seeing how good I can get a clear quality picture without being a professional.  And I am the blow-up and crop queen, it's extremely important to me.  The Olympus is up there equal to the best with less fuss.  The canon took too long to autofocus, and the Panasonic FZ200 was a hard one to give up, but turning the lens for distance on the Olympus was much more enjoyable than the toggle on the panasonic.Update 1/24/13Okay, I got curious.  I bought a Sony slt a57.  It was rated better than the pl1.  I went out and shot 120 pictures.  It did not beat the Pen epl1.  The clearest shots got blurry before they broke up with the Sony, as enlarged.  With the Pen the pictures break up first and do not get blurry.  The Sony seemed to have less than a focus area than the Pen.  Meaning that more of the outer edges of the item were blurry, whereas, the Pen gives a larger area of clarity without impeding on the bokeh or background blur.  The Sony is easier to use the menus, but the trade-off is the bulk. The Sony is easily twice the size and weight. The clear pictures with the Sony, I find , are a hair softer than the PEN. I can't see lugging that camera around my neck for the day.  All my comparisons were done freehand with some enlargement and cropping of the picture.Meaning that they were only compared by making the pictured item closer up in the laptop picture edit.  And all were taken with the Auto program. All the cameras I tested had an upgraded lens.  If I had to do it all over again, I would have not wasted my time comparing this awesome Pen e-pl1 to popular midrange DSLR cameras.  This Olympus PEN is majorly overlooked as a popular camera, which is great because you save a lot of money buying it.  It's a gem.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Step up from point and shoot", "Author": "Jesse V. Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3VZUDT9C9DSCM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I fit the market that this product is targeted at; owner of higher end point and shoots (Canon G series), and until now using mostly the automatic or scene modes. I was attracted by the better image quality, high definition video, and interchangeable lenses.POSITIVES:The camera has exceeded my expectations. I've found that using different lenses has changed the way I think about photography, and opened the door to a whole new world. This camera is easy adapted to use hundreds of old lenses with manual focus. Initially, I was intimidated by this, but soon found that manual focusing is easy with the help of the digital zoom mode, accessible with a single button press. One can purchase an adapter for about $40, and really nice lenses begin around at $50 used at your local camera shop, or on e-bay. For someone stepping up from point and shoot, this is very exciting.Image quality is excellent, and the large sensor allows much, much better low light photography; basically allowing you to do things you wouldn't think of with a point and shoot, and leave the color draining flash off. You also get a smaller depth of field, and photos will have that professional looking blurred background. A personal preference, but I like the way Olympus cameras handle color, and think the photos look really good in that regard. I do not shoot RAW, but like that the camera allows me to do that if I want.The camera is responsive. I know that this is probably only true for someone that has only used point and shoots in the past, and this camera is considered sluggish compared to DSLR cameras in terms of auto focus. But, it's really not a problem for me, and I consider some of the discussion about that issue to be misleading. It is plenty fast, and even faster if you get a Panasonic lens, like the excellent 20mm f1.7. Qualitatively, to me, it seems about twice as fast with Panasonic lenses.NEGATIVES:I wish it were a little smaller. While, smaller than any DSLR, it is still big compared to many P and S cameras. Mine quit working after about 20 days, but Amazon's customer service is great, and I think I'm back on track. Not sure what happened, may a little rain got to where it shouldn't? I agree with others, this camera would be much better if it had a dial, like the EP-1 and EP-2. Using the four way button controller is a little awkward as you start customizing settings. These are the things that prevent me from giving it 5/5 stars. Overall, a great camera.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Nice Camera But A Bit of A Mixed Bag", "Author": "shuTTL3bus \"shuTTL3bus @gmail .com\"", "ReviewID": "R2A3EW9W335NMN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What do you get when you take Olympus PEN and mix it with a stripper (Of course I mean someone who strips features from a camera). You get the E-PL1 camera which is a little bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand you have one of the best versions of the m4/3 sensor to date. From what I have read it is better than both the E-P1 and E-P2 sensors. It is hard to tell the difference at normal screen and printing resolutions and I take a picture at its whole and don't pixel peep so I cannot verify that. What I can say is this camera is capable of producing world class images. Additionally, this camera has the Olympus JPEG engine which is regarded in the business as one of the best. This camera is also relatively small and light and includes a fill flash. Additionally, it has image stabilization (IS) built into the camera. It is not pocketable and the size of this camera has more to do with the lens that it is wearing then the actual camera itself.On the other hand, you have a camera that is slow to focus. It appears to me that it zooms to infinity (and beyond) and then catches the focus on its way back in. If you are taking pictures of forever-in-motion kids you can be sure you will miss quite a few decisive moments. Additionally, this camera lacks the most important camera control there is. This is the control wheel used to change exposure, aperture, and shutter settings in a quick efficient manner. Instead this camera uses buttons which is an unwieldy way of making these changes. Most higher end Point and Shoot (P+S) cameras have some version of this control wheel. I think anyone transitioning to this camera from a DSLR or high end P+S will be frustrated by this. I've seen this billed as a good thing as there are less controls to get confused over. That may be so but all m4/3 cameras can be used as point and shoot by just keeping in the intelligent Auto(iA) mode. This simplifies the menu options and takes great pictures a majority of the time.I think for anyone who wants to step up from a P+S to take better Image Quality pictures but plans to stay in the iA mode 90% of the time, then this camera will serve you well and will take some amazing images. Just remember P+S type focusing speed.Anyone, who has a E-P1or E-P2 who want a sensors with a weaker Anti-Aliasing filter (i.e. less detail lost to the AA filter) and a fill flash will enjoy this camera for the IQ but will probably be frustrated with the loss of the control wheelAnyone either stepping up from a high end P+S such as the LX3, S90, or G11 will be impressed with the images, but not blown away by the difference, unimpressed with the P+S focus performance, and frustrated in the P, A, S or M shooting modes. Additionally, you will be unimpressed with the bigger size of the camera but will enjoy the flexibility if your budget includes other lenses.Anyone, getting this as a second carry around camera to a DSLR, will be happy with the smaller size and weight but unhappy with the slower performance. And frustrated by the clumsy controls but happy with the video capabilities.If you don't need or want the video, don't mind IS in the lens instead of the camera, and can put up with a slight decrease in you IQ, ISO, and JPEG performance, then the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1 12.1MP Digital Camera with Lumix G Vario 14-45 mm f/3.5-5.6 ASPH Mega OIS Lens (Red) offers many upgrades at the same price (Integrated 1.4mp EVF, Swivel Screen, 460k screen, Grip for bigger lenses, faster focus performance, etc)For the same price, the newly announced G10 matches the E-PL1 with video, and new processing engine (cross your fingers for a JPEG improvement). Additionally, it has a 2kp EVF (I'm not sure how useful that will be), a grip, a control wheel, a 1/4000 shutter speed and faster focus performance. It does not have in-camera IS.For those planning on getting the EVF at some point or with an ~$200 greater budget, check out the newly announced G2. Take the G1, add 720P 60/50fps video, an improved processing engine, a new dial to change focusing modes, touch screen controls that look to work as slick as an iPhone, and touch screen focus, and you have a really really nice full featured camera.Finally, if you don't need interchangeable lenses or don't plan on buying any more lenses and you don't mind a degradation of IQ, then the Canon S90, Canon G11, and Panasonic LX3(Leica D-Lux 4) are easier to carry around everywhere (especially the S90) and are cheaper(the gap will close when the price of this camera falls).Here is a quick list of pros and cons of the E-PL1ProsThe best Olympus implementation of the m4/3 sensorOne of the best JPEG engines in the businessRelatively small and lightBuilt in flashIn camera Image Stabilization(IS)Price (The cheapest m4/3 yet)Optional EVF (A very nice 1.4mp unit but very pricy at $279)Its availableNice build qualityConsSlow Autofocus (Panasonic has this figured out.

I needed something smaller than my dSLR (Canon 7D), but I still needed excellent image quality. This camera was extremely easy to use, and performed well in just about every environment I used it in (90+ degree dusty villages, golden hour, twilight, sandy beaches, and it even got caught out in a small rain storm).The build quality of the camera itself is impressive, with a very solid, metal case. The image quality has been very good. I shot in manual mode about 80% of the time, and found the aperture and shutter settings quick and easy to use (even without a specific dial).I also purchased this camera for its purported video capabilities. I don't think it will replace a full size dSLR for video quality (certainly not the 7D or 5D), but it shot video that I don't mind editing together and showing people.I was also impressed by the battery life of this camera. 1 rechargeable battery allowed me to get through about 2 days of shooting (averaged about 3 hours of camera-powered-up time each day). I purchased two rechargeable batteries along with the camera and it's default battery, and this worked out perfect for the 10 days that I was out of the country.Cons: There are very few negatives to discuss here. I wish that this camera had a simple input connection to plug in a mic (as it is, you have to purchase an adapter that slides into the hot shoe). The default lens worked well, but, compared to the camera body, felt more fragile and looked like it could break more easily. It took a little while to figure out the specifics of video lighting control, as these were less intuitive.

Nikon and Canon packages had my attention, until I read reviews on the Olympus Four-Thirds PEN cameras.  Between the lower price point and the wide choice of accessories and interchangeable lenses, in the end I chose the Olympus PEN E-PL1.  What tipped the scale in my final decision was that an acquaintance had the Olympus with him and was taking pictures with it at the top of a 4,000 ft mountain we'd just climbed during a club New Year's Day bicycle ride.  Basically, the recommendation was, he could easily bring the camera with him on activities out and about (such as bicycle rides), which he'd be less likely to do with a larger, heavier full-size DSLR, yet the image quality and versatility of the Olympus PEN E-PL1 was far superior to that of the portable point and shoot cameras.  Plus, it fit comfortably in my smaller hands.So that's it in a nutshell.  Pretty portable, light-weight but not \"toy\"-like, interchangeable lenses, good quality images, affordable.  After I ordered the camera, while I was waiting for it to arrive I watched the official Olympus marketing videos and became really excited about what this little baby can do.... the tag line, with which I concur, so far, is \"the new powerfully simple Olympus PEN E-PL1, greater than the sum of its parts\" ([...]), and I can't wait to try it all.  Together with the 40-150mm telephoto lens and accessory kit (wide-angle, zooms, filters, table-top tripod, etc, Olympus M.

Even joined up my (professional-photographer) sister's Photo Project Club, so hopefully my visually creative side will be jump-started after a long time of lying dormant.So far my one \"complaint\" with the design is that it has an \"instant video\" button which is placed right where your hand accidentally triggers it to go on next to the the grip on the back/side of the camera.  It's marketed as a feature, but i feel that it's a misguided piece of the otherwise nearly perfect overall design.  Luckily, there's a handy \"delete\" button for the unintentional ones, and there is probably a way to set the video button to locked, so it's not always going on at every touch (-:", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Keith Jackson", "ReviewID": "R3NUA3A5XO6LLS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Every picture is beautiful.

The moment my hands got onto this sweet baby, I knew I'd found my soul mate. Makes me sorry I spent all that money on the BIG Cannon (sic). Mind you, there are still things that I suspect will call for the bigger gun, but for most things I do, this is perfect.It is fast. Focuses fast. Recharges (using flash) fast. Has nice speed multiple-shot burst, though not quite as fast as the bigger camera. The anti shake is built into the camera and is not lens dependent, which is a fine thing for shaky old me. It is light and easy on my wrists. It packs up almost as small as my point and shoot, but oh my goodness how much better are the pictures it takes!!!!The controls are VERY simple. The manual that comes with it, unfortunately, may make the controls sound more complicated than they are. But it's a pretty decent manual even so and there was an obvious well-meaning attempt to include everything. Which, to fit it all in, they wrote in a kind of short hand that somethimes leaving me saying \"huh?\"In I-Auto, it is amazingly smart. They all SAY they are, but this one really IS. It will find a face in the crowd, literally. It is great for photographing my doll collection because it will find all the doll's faces and perform color correction at the same time ... without any assist from me, even using flash. Amazing.I wish it had a built in viewfinder, but I bit the bullet and ordered the electronic one that attaches to the hot shoe/utility port. I'm used to a viewfinder and it feels weird not having one.The LCD screen is plenty big and plenty bright.I have never seen so many choices of scene types or art filters ... and everything is easy easy easy to access. You don't have to navigate though layers of menus. It's right there.The controls fit in my hands.The camera feels solid and well built and biggest shock? The kit lens is fantastic! I did order one more longer lens, but that will cover it for me ... and at a price that does not break the bank. There are not yet enough lens choices, but because the 3/4 format lens mount has been standardized, you can use any lens from any 3/4 camera and it will fit. Now there's a concept the big manufacturers should consider adopting!!!In short, this is a great camera. REALLY super. I am very happy with it. Now I can take even MORE pictures. I'm sure glad I have a really huge hard drive!!I feel obliged to make a couple of additional comments:If you want metadata on photographs, you have to set it to on or it will not record. Most cameras record metadata automatically, but this doesn't. Just a warning.The manual is incomprehensible, at least to me. I was a tech writer for 30 years and I know a thing or two about manuals ... this one seems fine until you realize that the instructions don't make any sense. Finally gave in and bought \"Olympus Pen E-PL1 for Dummies.\" I'm not a dummy, but a quick look at the info in this book made me realize that if I wanted to get the most from my camera, I needed instructions that made sense. The book does. The manual doesn't.The software that comes with the camera is awful and as far as I am concerned, useless. I removed it from my computer. Fortunately, between Lightroom and Photoshop, I don't need it. Don't count on using it for anything. Get software that works!

Generally i did not use the flash at all, but at night there was times where i wanted to but got frustrated enough to just not bother. There is no bulb-assist auto focus of any sort. The fast f/1.7 lens helps here, but overall it struggled in the dark.

Because of this I had been watching the Panasonic/Olympus Micro Four Thirds system for a while as it promised to provide DSLR quality in a much smaller package. The E-PL1 for me was the tipping point in terms of price that I wanted to pay for a camera, along with the features I wanted. Also I'll freely admit this: I've been an Olympus guy all my life, and have typically been very happy with their products (although I'll admit I've owned a Sony P&S; as well, so I'm not exclusive).What's to like about the E-PL1: Its light, well constructed (of plastic admittedly, but it's more solid than most modern cameras I've used), the menu system is not too complex and gives learners a light intro into the art of SLR photography, the lenses are extremely small compared to their equivalents in the regular 35mm world, and the quality of photography I have achieved since buying this camera has been amazing compared to what I was capable with with a regular P&S.; 720p video adds to the package also, but it's really the size that is king here. You get a camera which is smaller and much less intimidating looking compared to what you're used to at this quality.Downside to this camera is clearly the lack of a viewfinder. People coming from SLR background will probably miss this the most, those of use who have grown used to using the LCD to shoot won't care that much, and I find the viewfinder works fine in daylight. There is an optional viewfinder available for purchase if you miss it though. I have not bothered.In all, very highly recommended for those who want to step up to \"proper photography\", but don't want to have to lug a massive camera bag around with you.

I wanted to try something more advanced but I didn't want the bulk or weight of an SLR system. The technology in the MFT's intrigued me, and the Olympus fit my budget.My observations (after about 4 months).1. I cannot see anything at all on the LCD in full daylight, even with a shade. I'm amazed that some people can; kudos to them. I bought the VF-3 viewfinder which is less expensive than the VF-2 and works just fine. Factor in the cost of a viewfinder unless you try the camera before buying and you're sure that you won't need it.2. The kit lens is good for backyard shots, but you'll almost certainly want more lenses. I bought the least expensive Oly MFT telephoto ($300.); for my other lenses I'm planning to try a third-party 40.5 mm adapter ring that is supposed to work with MFT, but it hasn't arrived yet.3. Plan to buy a book on how to use the camera - there are a couple available. The menu system is sophisticated, powerful, and (IMO) non-intuitive. In addition, I've read that the Japanese-to-English manual doesn't mention everything that you can do with the MFT. I'm just beginning, and I expect that it will take me quite some time to thoroughly learn this camera.4. This MFT is slow, but not nearly as slow as it appears to be out of the box. I was shocked at first at the slow shutter lag and writing-to-card time in iauto, but that can be overcome. I eventually shot some sharp, crystal clear shots of my brother playing with my cats indoors by using stop motion. I caught feathers flying through the air and even the curve of a string while in fast motion. The speed between pictures in burst mode is still on the slow side, but not *that* slow.5. You cannot use this camera straight out of the box for action shots or low-light. I was disappointed with this camera at first b/c my Panny nearly always takes great shots in full-on auto mode and I thought that a few auto shots on the MFT would give me a good idea of the quality of this camera. Not so. You will likely have to make adjustments to shutter speed etc. to get decent shots. You will want to adjust the speed between shots. In iauto mode there is a helpful special menu, Live Guide, that allows easy basic changes. There's an excellent video on You-Tube that can help with this.6. One really good thing about this camera is that it is teaching me more about manual controls (and thus photography) b/c I like to shoot scenes for which the iauto mode is inadequate. With my Panny, I played but I mostly used auto.Summary: This is not a P&S; camera. Don't expect it to work perfectly in all situations right out of the box. Plan to invest some time and money in purchasing add-ons and learning the system. Your investments will be richly rewarded with excellent photographs (always bearing in mind that it is the quality of photographer, not the quality of the camera, that produces the best results).Plus five stars for picture quality, Live Guide in iauto mode, the many things that this camera can do.Minus one star for horrible instructions, badly placed buttons (especially the video button), useless LCD, no EVF built in, outrageous prices for EVF and adapter rings, user-unfriendly menus, and slow burst speed (even after adjustment).", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Olympus pen pl-1 camera", "Author": "Keith H.

Granted, I don't have a problem with camera phones in general. They're great for emailing pics, but lousy if you decide to make a print. I think my wife was beginning to feel that the limitations of the camera phone were seriously outweighing the convenience of it and mentioned to me recently how she wanted a \"real\" camera. She has limited photography knowledge, but was interested in getting a camera that could take decent photos, had some creative flexibility and could grow with her. She hinted about getting a DSLR, but I knew that this would be a BIG learning curve, and didn't think she would make the commitment of lugging a big camera around.After nosing around a couple of photography forums, I came across the Olympus E-PL1. I'm familiar with the Olympus brand back in the days when I was an avid film photographer and knew they made nice, compact cameras with decent lenses. I know that there are newer versions of this model, but the price was too good to pass-up, so I sprung on it because I wanted her to have a nice camera for our vacation.I have to admit, this camera has definitely exceeded my expectations in terms of image quality and depth of features. The four thirds format which Olympus has pioneered as well as the large MOS sensor and friendly, yet rich camera controls really has pushed the PL1 into new and exciting creative possibilities that you just don't see in most point-and-shoots. The controls are for the most part, very logically laid out and have extra features for both the experienced and novice photographers (like the Live Guide controls which greatly simplify image tweeking). What's also nice is that you can use any third party micro four thirds or four thirds camera lenses with this body. The only downside that I see is the lack of a built in eyepiece and how sometimes it will search a little longer to get an object in dim light in focus. Other than that, this baby is a winner.Granted, my wife is still learning how to operate the camera, but she too is amazed at the quality photos this camera produces.

I've taken several thousand photos in all different kinds of lighting situations. I use the white balance options frequently.For those who like a viewfinder, the VF-2 is an excellent option. I use it about 95% of the time.Images are a bit noisy at the higher ISOs, but this shouldn't be a surprise, given the size of the sensor. I've made several \"how to\" videos, and the quality is very good, although for some reason they won't import into Sony Vegas Studio.I have a sizable number of manual focus lenses, so at some point I should pick up some of the adapters.It's a great camera, and I haven't found it lacking in any way so far.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Overall, I am very pleased with this camera. I like using it, and haven't bumped into too many limitations. The autofocus definitely struggles in low light, and then you'll have to switch to manual focus.Image stabilization, the self-cleaning sensor and Live View are very good features.What I liked:- Price. To be truthful, I bought this model because of its low cost. I haven't been disappointed. I think it's one of the best deals in compact system cameras (CSCs).- Small size. Feels great in your hands. Buttons mostly are where they need to be. I found the interface to be fine. But maybe because I had owned an Olympus Evolt 500 at one time.- Build quality: Everything feels tight. There is some heft to the camera, which gives it a feeling that it's not your typical point and shoot.- Rear screen. OK, so it's just 2.7 inches or whatever. The screen is excellent with such a high refresh rate that it seems almost like a video camera.- Exposure. So far, I think that the camera gets the exposure right more often than it misses.- One-button video record. I haven't made many videos, but this definitely made it much easier and avoided doing the usual \"turn control knob to video\" and then press shutter button to start.What I didn't like:- Lots of button-pushing required. I think this might be endemic to all Asian camera makers, as they seem fascinated by adding buttons. And to quickly access certain controls, you really have to memorize the sequence.- LCD screen in sunlight. This isn't limited to this camera. I bought the VF-2 viewfinder, which is excellent with this camera, especially for those of us who don't like holding a camera at arm's length or have eyes that have difficulty focusing on close objects (such as LCD screens).- The art filter software grinds the camera to a halt. Screen refresh slows dramatically to the point that it feels like one of those really early digital cameras from the 1990s. This was a bit disappointing.Other- Shutter noise. I erroneously was hoping for P&S; noise levels. I didn't realize that it had an actual focal-plane shutter. This was my fault.- Memory card requirements. For larger cards, make sure that they are Class 6 or higher. Slower cards will error out upon format or possibly not correctly record your image.

I bought the Sony mainly as a hiking and family occasion camera.  The zoom range, macro focus, low light level performance, and pocket size are all I could expect.  I then tried to use it to take some coin pictures and was very disappointed.  With no RAW mode there was very poor fine detail.  The Sony has more megapixels than it can focus sharply.I bought the Olympus for the coin pictures and the detail it can achieve is outstanding.  It does not focus close up so I tried extension tubes.  The focus outside of a very small spot in the center was very fuzzy.  I tried close up lenses.  At first I had serious chromatic aberration at the edges.  Change in lighting and camera angle solved that.  The coin pictures are very nice.  I can see more detail than by looking at the coins even with a magnifying glass.  So how does it compare with the Sony?  The Sony wins in all areas except for taking sharp pictures.  Sony goes hiking and to get togethers, Olympus stays home and takes coin pictures.I have on Olympus OM2 and 4 associated lenses.

However, the images made by the E-PL1 are definitely higher quality, with much better sharpness and dynamic range, and significantly better high ISO capabilities.  After all, the sensor is much larger.Yes, this is a somewhat slow focussing camera but auto-focus seems more accurate than some higher end dSLR cameras that I've used.  Because of the very weak anti-aliasing filter, images made with good optics like those listed above are as sharp as any digital images that I've seen, regardless of price or brand.  Dynamic range is a bit of an issue with noticeable highlight clipping.  However, shooting in  RAW+JPEG and under-exposing slightly seems to help a lot.  Color quality is very nice in all file formats.Given its image quality and sensor size, this camera is definitely small enough and light enough, much more so than any comparable dSLRs.  Due to the availability of high-grade optics, system flexibility and image quality is better than one-trick ponies ( oops - one good lens compact \"system\" cameras like the recently introduced Samsung and Sony models.Some of the adjustment issues can be minimized by using the \"super\" menu although setting the rear \"OK\" function button to bring up a full adjustment menu is not well-explained in the manual and is not an intuitively obvious menu item.Handling is much improved by adding the very nice VF-2 viewfinder, if you can get it at a reasonable price.  That way, you can either have really good handling when desired or a very compact camera if you mount a pancake lens.Overall, though, the new Olympus E-PL2 seems like a more usable camera for $100 more, with an adjustment wheel and a much less wobbly zoom lens.

Either you're stuck with having to buy a super chunky DSLR that weighs 1000 pounds or you have to shell out at least $400 for a prosumer point and shoot that, by virtue of being a point and shoot, doesn't give you a lot of creative control.Enter micro four-thirds. The Olympus Pen EP-L1 was my first foray into this type of camera, because I was sick and tired of the either/or of DSLRs and compacts. I wanted a moderately inexpensive camera that could take better than average pictures and be easy to carry, so I decided to take the plunge with MFT.Having finally taken it, I'm happy to say that I was so thrilled with the Olympus Pen EP-L1 that I immediately sold off my much older DSLR so I could purchase more accesories for it.So what's got me so excited exactly?CLASSIC LOOK, WEIGHT, AND FEELThe Olympus Pen-EP L1 was the first digital camera I ever held that felt like an analog camera. People who used to shoot film will know exactly what I'm talking about. Digital cameras have this toy-like and plasticky feel to them. Everything about this Oly feels like you're using a real camera, right down to the clicking shutter sound, metal accents on the body, and vintage appearance.The weight is just about \"right\", too. The Pen EP-L1 isn't as light as a compact but not as rock heavy as a DSLR. Portability is a breeze-- just remove the lens, and you can easily slip both into the pockets of your backpack or the inside pocket of your jacket or coat without issue.KIT LENS- SURPRISINGLY GOODI was very pleased with the kit lens; I actually found it performed much better than the one for my old DSLR, which was hit or miss. Images were sharp, and I was finally able to get a clear handheld shot of these votive candles in dim lighting from St. Patrick's Cathedral after years of trial-testing other cameras (see my customer images, which is posted under this version-- Olympus PEN E-PL1 12.3MP Live MOS Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera with 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Digital Zoom Lens (Slate Blue)). I was able to also take fairly sharp pictures inside of St. Paddy's (of course with some bracing), which was impressive.COLORS- RICH AND WARM TONEDThe colors are outstanding in this camera, very reminiscent of Fujifilm-- very rich, warm, and true to life without being oversaturated, bland, or unnatural. I was really knocked back when I saw the first pictures I took. With previous cameras, I've always remembered first impressions being disappointing. This was the first camera where I was like, \"Wow, look at the colors! Nice!\"JAM-PACKED WITH CREATIVE FEATURES AND CONTROLThe Oly is an enthusiast's dream. Not only is there full manual control, there are many interesting filter and camera effects you can apply, such as \"tilt shift\", pop art, panorama, and multiple exposure.USABILITYI've heard people complain about the buttons and dials of this camera. I'm surprised, because I found it incredible intuitive. I guess what's throwing everyone off is that the buttons are laid out so differently from a standard camera. (For example, there is a separate button for film and video). There are some other oddities similar to this. But playing around with the camera for a couple of hours, I got used to it very quickly.PRICEAre ya kidding me? This is one of the few micro 4/3ds you can get at this price point (the other being the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF3 12 MP Micro 4/3 Compact System Camera with 3-Inch Touchscreen LCD and 14-42mm Zoom Lens (Black) at the time of this writing). At under $300 you can't beat it!A FEW CAVEATSAs great as the Pen EP-L1 is, there are some issues you'll want to know about.Number one, the SD slot-slash-battery compartment is cheap and poorly designed. Not only is it cumbersome to fish out the SD card, the cover (which clunkily swings open at a 90 degree angle) is an accident just waiting to happen. (I can just see one day a fumble for the memory card resulting in a hand accidentally knocking back against the cover and damaging it). I've lent my cameras to my father before (who's kind of clumsy) and would to other people. I definitely wouldn't lend this camera to someone because of this issue, because I can just imagine them handing it back with a sheepish grin and going, \"Hehehe... uh, I had a little whoopsy! Sorry!\"Number two, the flash is a little odd. You have to remember to unlock it first before you can use it. Not a big deal, but it takes some getting used to.Number three, although there are quite a few cool filter effects in the Pen (\"diorama, pop, etc\"), you need patience to use them. This is because the screen preview lags horribly when shooting. So as nice as these filters are to have, you're probably better off just shooting your image normally and altering it later in an image editor.Number four, you can only shoot HD video for 7 minutes at a time.Number five, the back cap to the kit lens is very flimsy and easy to lose, because it doesn't twist or screw on-- it pops on, making it easy to \"pop off.\"Number six (and lastly), don't expect miracles with this camera. Let me put it this way-- you'll definitely get better image output and low noise from the Pen than any point and shoot under $400. However, the performance won't equal that of a DSLR. Noise starts showing up in shadowy areas at 100 ISO. And pictures taken on overcast days, fuhgeddaboutit. Noise and speckling all around, even at 200 ISO.The good news is that it looks like the natural grain of analog film, especially when tweaking settings. The bad news is that if you were hoping to buy this camera with the expectation that it would be like your current DSLR, except \"lighter\", you're out of luck.So basically, get this camera if you're looking to upgrade from a point and shoot in terms of better image quality and creative control. But don't get this to switch over from a DSLR, because low light level performance still isn't quite \"there\" yet. It's not a deal breaker in terms of noise-- just saying that for someone hoping it'll match that of a DSLR, you'll be a bit disappointed.", "Date": "October 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "I'm an amateur to photography", "Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "R3JTH5D4UMVMEB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Photography?

We have had it for a week now and I LOVE it!! It has so many great options!!! Its easy to use and small enough to fit in a camera bag. It was the perfect step up from a point n shoot. The only downfall of the camera is it does not have a black and white setting. It has a grainy film setting which is black and white but also grainy. So if I ever want traditional black and white photos I will need to shoot in color and edit them to black and white. To me this is no big deal! It was well worth the price!! Other \"beginner\" slr cameras I considered were up to 3 times the amount. At 280 dollars I am happy to have such a great product! I also should add that I was very intimidated by the pop-up flash, but after using the camera it is not a big deal at all! The flash is still automatic you just have to press a button to pop the flash up while taking photos to make sure the flash goes off when needed. We had our professional photographer look at it today and even she was impressed by the amount of options on this camera! It may be a little more than we need but I will grow into it and learn how to take advantage of all the options. It's a great product!!

I wanted to use these legacy lens and accessories with a digital camera and this camera is the perfect digital back for me as well as a near DSLR camera too when you get an adapter which are available for almost any legacy camera on the Internet.I quickly found out that legacy lens are not as sharp as the newer digial ones and of course are much bigger and heavier.  I did all kinds of testing which I like to do and got that bug out of my system since the only usable ones were the microscope, telescope, and 50mm prime lens that provided either unique function or a quality picture.I have always had a soft spot for Olympus cameras and this one did not disappoint me.  The best camera is the one you have with you and that is always the lightest and smallest one; I usally have a camera with me all the time.  This one is the best compromise I have tried so far combining near DSLR and portability with HD video.Like anything else if you honestly define your requirements and then look for a camera to match you will be ahead of the game; many people are in denial and have some requirements that are based on what others seem to want.Overall I think the vast majority of people who want something more than a P&S; would be very happy with this camera and I highly recommend it for the price point.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best camera around", "Author": "geprieto", "ReviewID": "R3LF43UUE2CYYI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is just too close to be perfect. I originally had my sights on the pen e-p2 and the panasonic G1, but I decided on the e-pl1. Not because of the price, but for the flash (not present on the e-p2) and the bulb mode (limited to 4 minutes on the G1). The build quality is excellent, and is more heavy than I imagined. The sensor quality is VERY good! I had a Canon SX before, DSLR, and the quality is even better, especially at high ISO modes. And just as they say the auto mode of this camera really works. I used to shoot almost always in Aperture priority mode, or at least in Program. With this gadget I almost never leave the auto mode. True, I do photography for hobby, but I know my way around cameras.The only issue I have with it is that for now there is no cheap lens to buy with a high field of view. Since it is micro 4/3 you get 2x of the focal distance, so the kit lens performs like a 28-84mm, and you will find yourself walking quite some steps back to get your subjects into the picture. But the video mode on its own helps to forget this. Before this camera I never shoot video. Now I find my photo albums are a multimedia mix, since the steps form one to the other almost disappear with this unit.If you got tired of carrying around your bag with the DSLR, lenses, flash, etc this is a MUST BUY.", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "E-pl1 for video, a few weeks of use, my thoughts.", "Author": "Ink Stain", "ReviewID": "R20ULKRXL7S99V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have an Olympus 520, and a lot of manual lenses, and adapters, so I bought the E-pL1 for video, and adapters for Nikkor and M42 screw mount Takumar's so I can use them for video lenses. I have old Cannon lenses, but not the adapter yet for them so I cannot talk about that, but you can use most any lens. The adapters are fine, focus is always an issue, but live mode helps on a tripod in bright light, hand held its a guess due to LCD washout. You can use the old school stuff of street shooting to a set distance. Using the manual lens distance scale. The shooting modes and color control for the camera to its 720p HD level of quality is outstanding for video use, as long as you know that DSLR video is going to be on a tripod to avoid the jello effect, and that the in body stabilization available for manual lenses, which works well for stills, is not the same as the electronic stabilization for the video mode, on a tripod you can get great color and a lot of choices. Since I am interested in studio video and animation, shake is not much of an issue. I like the size, kit lens, color, modes, and art mode color. I have the external sound adapter, and its very useful. In manual mode with external sound, pre focus set, good video even at lower light levels is outstanding on a tripod. You can shoot hand dim light with manual glass for stills, video I think you might need a mono pod at least and a steady hold, even the EVF would help, which I may get later. Its not a high end cannon, but then its (...) and is small and has a good external mic setup and a good EVF if you want it. It can be carried with a light tripod, and a couple of manual lenses, to a site to shoot, and the kit lens in manual is quite good when shooting video.You want a bag camera that can do near high end stills and is ready for video, if you have a mini pod or light tripod, its SO much easeir to carry. I feel confident I can get it done.What does it not have. It cannot use a remote, it has no control mode, cannot be controled by software from a PC, no current remote works. Even the one on Amazon, the Aputure, that says it does. It may work with the Ep2, but not this one. This is irritating. I like a remote for video in studio, but its not a killer. Olypmpus live view is handy in focus assist but really shines on a tripod.  I find manual glass focus fine in low light or shade to focus, on near subjects by hand, but in bright light the LCD washes out. With the Kit lens, for stills, its ok to compose, and its not an issue. I find the E-pL1 on the whole to be easier to focus with manual glass than the 520. Its my top choice in bang for the buck and flexible use, if you can set up a shoot, manual glass is fun, for P and S, the kit is excellent.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not compelling for a \"pointer and shooter\" or for a DSLR user", "Author": "Cay Horstmann", "ReviewID": "RGTJQV74UVHCI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I tried this camera, both with its default lens and a much smaller \"pancake\" lens.

You need to carry a case, which meant for me I wouldn't take it all that often.And when I do carry a case, I might as well take a full-size DSLR camera (such as my Nikon D-5000). The quality is better, and the user interface is far, far superior. The E-PL1 has an LCD display that is unusable in bright light. (You'd need to get the viewfinder which adds more bulk and cost).

The built-in art filters can offer some interesting possibilities for some great shots. Furthermore, the Micro 4/3 sensor delivers impressive picture quality. I've been shooting with this camera for a couple of months, and it's hard to get bored of this camera, simply because it offers a good amount of options for your buck.That being said, I feel like this camera is more of a point and shoot rather than a full-blown Mirrorless interchangeable lens camera.  Strictly speaking, the lack of a dedicated shutter speed/exposure dial immediately signals that this camera is MEANT as a novice camera for those who just want good, easy shots. Furthermore, as other reviews have stated, the camera does have a good amount of limitations.Besides the lack of dials, I have two main issues with this camera. First, the autofocus is not as good as it could be. The speed is bearable in good light conditions, but in medium/low light conditions, AF becomes noticeably slower. There is an option for manual focus, but it is not practical in any sense. Also, don't expect to shoot many good nice photos with this camera. The ISO good up to around 500, and if you go past 800, there's a significant increase in noise. I try not to go above 800 at night. I tried to do some street photography with this camera, but it is incredibly difficult if not impossible since I have to drag the shutter speed down to 1/15 or lower (or the camera drags it down for me if I'm in A mode) to compensate for the ISO, thereby making the photo incredibly blurry.However, if you just want a fun little camera that offers a taste of what photography is, then look no further. However, if you're an amateur who knows the basics about photography, then this might not be the camera for you. I've read many reviews stating that there is little difference in terms of image quality between the EP and the EPL.

My first camera was the Fujifilm WP Finepix (Don't get me wrong I absolutely adore Fuji and their accomplishments with camera tech. ) and being a sport camera it was only 8MP and did a good job at catching the moment but sacrificing image clarity in the process.

My 60D with my 70-200mm F4 L lens takes care of the grand kids sporting events while the Fh20 is my daily carry around camera.  IQ from the E-PL1 is wonderful. Crisp. Sharp.

I'm impressed.*Really* impressed.With this body, and a stationary subject, and poor indoor lighting, in many cases at ISOs as low as 640 I'm able shoot hand held at 1/4 second - even stopped down a bit when I need to, with \"acceptable\" results under *really* marginal conditions (with a M43 sensor you are always balancing *very* serious compromises in low light, but with the PEN sensor's somewhat better higher ISO performance, plus the stabilization, this body works wonders compared to the GF-1 - I'm getting 3 - 3.5 stops, at least).For example, the uploaded image (above) of the U505 submarine at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry is straight .jpg  out of the camera, ISO 640,, Oly 9-18mm wide zoom at f/5.6 10mm,... handheld *overhead... at a 1/4 sec exposure(!)Is it perfect?Not by a long shot.Is it *way* better than I have any right to expect?I think so.And it's no fluke, for example out of 8 handheld exposures at that location 6 are of approximately that quality.Now, there is a downside to this body, it's a *lot* of work to set up each shot - a lot of controls that are readily accessible on the GF-1 (let alone most larger-sensor DSLRs) are menu items on the PL1, and it's not a particularly intuitive menu system - it was a *tough* to optimize DOF in that photo.But for a causal user attempting to take pictures under marginal light in the iauto or P modes, that stabilization is going to be golden!And for users who want more control?The PL1 is going back up here on Amazon... I just picked up a *new* E-PL2 here for $299.______________Bottom line: I'm going to give this body five stars - not for me (its' a 3.5-4), but for the user for whom IMO this is the *right* PEN body.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great purchase", "Author": "Andrew Kloster", "ReviewID": "RW599160T1TJO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the camera for about a month and it works perfect for me.

The lenses are tiny and light, making this system ideal for getting around. It's also much more innocuous than a dSLR, so people don't get as nervous around it. The video is fine, though the MJPEG doesn't seem to transcode as well as h.264. But if not transcoding, the raw video is of good quality. The downside is also the upside. As others have noted before, the menu system is simple, like that of a point and shoot camera. The problem is coming from a dSLR, this is really annoying. The menu system takes a lot to get used to. The extra knobs and buttons on the E-P2 does not make up for the price differential, despite the convenience. The E-PL1 is inexpensive and functional. The large sensor and light lenses make great pictures for this super flexible system. Purchased Panasonic 45-200mm f/4.0-5.6 Lumix G Vario MEGA OIS Zoom Micro Four Thirds Lens for Panasonic and Olympus Micro Four Thirds Cameras soon after and am amazed at the compact nature of the system. With an effective focal length of 400mm, the system gives me extra reach that the kit was unable to provide. The extra reach also brought up another problem with the focus points. While there are plenty of focus points, they're not that fine. Magnifying the display might help this problem, but I have yet to test this in the field. In summary, it's a great camera for the price.

If your looking for the fastest autofocus and huge lens selection, then you should consider the many excellent DSLRs out there.  If your looking for a camera that will outperform most of the compact cameras, then you should consider the E-PL1.  As an entry level micro 4/3s camera it provides excellent value and wonderful IQ.  The video capability adds to the appeal, but its not up to the capability of a good low end camcorder.Much has been said about the lack of control wheels on the E-PL1 versus the E-P1/2.  My personal experience is the control features of the E-PL1 are outstanding and easy to use with a short learning curve.  I was taking pictures immediately after charging the battery.  People stepping up from compact cameras can put the camera in i-Auto and let the camera make the decisions for great pictures under most conditions.  As you get familiar with the user interface, add more control into your picture taking.  People with DSLR experience can use the control features right away as they are quite intuitive.The display can be limiting in direct sunlight.  If you intend to take a lot of pictures outdoors with the sun shining directly onthe display, then consider the excellent EVF for the camera.Coupled with excellent JPEG output most users can use pictures right out of the camera.  Experienced users can use RAW output for post-processing.  The flash works well and I've found it very helpful to add light fill.  It will work out to about 12 feet; further if you increase the ISO to 3200.Anyway, I love my camera and recommend it highly.

The image stabilization feature is superb.  I'm now looking sadly at my E-500 because I love that camera, too, but it has less resolution than the PEN E-PL1, and it is quite heavy - 102.4 ounces vs. 11.2 ounces for the PEN E-PL1 (body).  The 70-300 mm zoom attached to the PEN felt so much lighter than when the E-500 was attached, so I felt I had greater flexibility and freedom in shooting.  Additionally with the PEN's better image stabilization, the images came out very clear in hand-held shots.The range of the kit lens is modest, so I would recommend a secondary lens with higher zoom, especially if you enjoy shooting wildlife or other subjects where you don't want to get too close.  However, the kit lens is great for travel and vacation shots, family photos, and photographing art work (my area).  It is easy to establish a custom white balance so that the true colors of any art are recorded accurately.  The resolution allows for printing images at poster size while maintaining detail.

K1000sm and other 35mm SLR's thru deserts, jungles (urban and natural) and across the worlds oceans. I learned certain disciplines early, using a tripod and Fuji 100 with a polarizer I produced many, many postcard quality photos, ASA 400 for handheld work and ASA 800 and 1600 for night snapshots. My favorite setup was Yashica FX3 kit. It was full manual like a k1000 with very good 28mm, 50mm and 135 primes. For me it was the ultimate setup for lugging around on my travels.

My 1st digital was a 3.2 MP Canon P&S; that took excellent pictures. I purchased it because it had a viewfinder so I could use it in bright sunlight. I became familiar with Chinese manufacturer when the lens mechanism stopped driving the lens and opening the lens. Next was a Samsung  NV10 which impressed me due to its metal body.

I started to look for a more serious enthusiast camera that could help me seriously move into the digital era and carry on with the serious passion I had in my 35mm SLR days. Enter the E-PL1.  I looked a the E-PL1 and decided the two zoom bundle would fit the bill nicely. I read the positive reviews and like the versatility of the two lenses. In figured the LCD was something I could assimilate to. Let me state now that many will disagree with my assessment of this camera but I stand by my findings and hope to help others of my age and experience make an educated assessment on the purchase this camera and determination of whether it will meet their needs. 1st off plan the price of the VF2 viewfinder with the eyecup if you are serious about composition. The LCD is just too difficult to see in bright sunlight. Plus being an old SLR guy holding the camera closer and firmly is a better discipline. Better yet purchase the VF4, it just a few bucks more. It will not be an upgrade on the E-PL1 but will be  if you decide to upgrade to a 16MP pen such as the E-PL5. After I first purchased this camera and the VF2 viewfinder my niece was having her wedding and asked if I would do the photography. Using just the 14-42mm kit lens I arrived to find that her grandmother had already hired a photographer with Nikon DSLR's. I Shot photos anyhow and in the end many of the photos were better than the hired photographer took. This was handheld and in auto mode. About 50% of the photos were outstanding. The problems with the rest were due to serious backlighting issues causing underexposure of the subject areas. Also there were low light focusing issues where the camera could not focus or was out of focus. Had I understood the manual controls of the camera and been able to be where the photographer had been and using my Tripod the rest of the photos would have been stellar also. It was also a record 108 degrees and the camera functioned fabulously. It did go thru a couple a batteries so invest in extra aftermarket batteries with a wall charger.  I can say with out a doubt you can use this camera at the professional level to shoot weddings if you understand and know how to utilize its potential. After becoming ill for a year and putting my resurgent photography hobby on hold I once again picked up the pen to learn its finer points.  As a Brit once told me \"You Yanks are ok but you never bother to read the bloody instructions\". As such I highly recommend the E-PL1 for dummies book, it is well worth the money spent on it. Once you read this book and understand the E-PL1's potential it becomes pretty straight forward. From looking at a friends E-PM1 and E-PL3 it will help you navigate and understand other PEN menus also. I can comment or compare the E-PL1 menus compared to the brands because this is my 1st digital camera I have attempted to use manually. The key to using this camera manually is the Super Guide. I find using this operating the camera manually is very straight forward.  At the time I purchased this camera I had no idea that you could purchase adapters to utilize legacy lenses. My biggest complaint with digital camera systems is the staggering cost of good prime lenses which is why I purchased with the 2 zoom bundle. I was overcome with joy as I had a large collection of K-mount bodies and lenses. I have selected a new Sigma 28-85mm I had in new condition in the box.  a 28mm f 1.8 SMC-A Pentax, 50mm 1F1.2 SMC-M Pentax, and an excellent , super sharp new in the box Vivitar 135mm Series 1. These I already had. I purchased a used in new condition excellent Rokinon 70-200mm zoom for 20 bucks. The results with these legacy lenses have been excellent. Being an older person to me digital photos have what I call a digital look. This may be hard for some to understand but people my age reading this they will understand. It is like listening to stereo music in the old days with the old Marantz, Sansui, Fisher ball bearing analog stereo receivers, the digitally processed stereos sounded digital. To my old eyes the photos look digital and the legacy lenses make it look more film-like. While on the subject of using these legacy lenses remember that if you us IS make sure you set the focal length for the lens and figure in the crop factor, if not you will be working against yourself. If you are using a legacy zoom this will need to be changed as you vary the focal length. If you plan on changing focal lengths a lot you might fare better if you shut the IS off. Also remember that with any lens you use shut the IS off when using a tripod.  I am of the opinion that if you are using the IS with legacy lenses and the focal length is incorrect the IS circuitry will be stressed because it will be constantly hunting for a solution it cannot achieve due to be fed incorrect data. The 4/3 lenses the focal length is fed to the body automatically thru the electrical contacts. Also make sure you figure in the crop factor. Of course these changes can be done reasonably fast using the super guide. Other anomalies to deal with when using legacy lenses with using adapters is that the legacy lenses put a lot of weight on the camera body when using a tripod. I was able to get an adapter on Amazon that has the tripod mount on the adapter so you can put the weight on the adapter and not the camera body.  This is also beneficial in that you have to remove the camera off the tripod mount to change the battery or memory as they are accessed from the bottom of the camera. By mounting on the adapter you avoid this. The tripod mount capable legacy adapter is highly recommended. Also when using legacy adapters set the sharpness control to +1 on primes and +2 on zooms as a general rule for best focusing results. Experiment with each legacy lense to finds its sweet spot. Others have told me that you can process this out later but I disagree, the better it is going in the better it will be later. The sharpness setting is electronically varying the sensor distance from the legacy lens helping it achieve sharper focus. This setting is also easily accessed with the Super Guide.  After putting this together I decide I wanted to have a spare body so I found a used purchased as reconditioned with a K-mount adapter and a  50mm f2.0 SMC-M. After getting it home and playing with I found later after putting my 14-42 kit lens on it that it would not auto-focus nor would it focus manually. I put the lens on my other E-PL1  and it would focus fine. I have tried to find a setting to resolve this but I have been unable to find a setting that can be changed or reset to remedy this and it has the 1.1 firmware. So if some knows of something I overlooked by all means provide me a comment. This is unfortunate because my biggest complaint is with the 4/3  is the crop factor I do not have a good manual 28mm wide angle. I was planning on having to use the 14-42 kit lense as my 28mm wide angle and I only have 1 body that can use it. Plus I would prefer something that produced something more film looking. I was able to locate a Vivitar labeled Samyang 17-28mm legacy zoom. This lens has average reviews but with the sharpness set to 2 it is bitingly sharp but it only crops out to 34-56 and I would prefer a good 28mm  equivalent prime. Zenit produces a 16mm fisheye with funky film plane side screw in color filters. If the Russians at Zenit are smart and read this they would make 12, 14, 16, 18, and 19mm 35 manual primes modelled from this existing 16mm 35mm fisheye to fit the new generation crop sensor digital cameras. They are already tooled up to make M42 and K-mounts and they would sell like hotcakes provide they thread it to take filters from the front side and they keep the price around 150 to 200 bucks . They are too many legacy lenses of other focal lengths to make producing those focal, lengths profitable. On the subject of kit lenses they are sharper at there lower 14 and 40mm focal lengths. On all the legacy lenses I use Polarizing filters and I find the Agfa being the better ones of the lower end ones. They use Japanese glass and pass the thump test I learned in my film days. The better filters will produce a crisp distinct tink sound when thumped with your finger. Lesser quality ones produce a dull thud. There are complaints of these and other filters ghosting. On this subject when using legacy lenses use a rubber adjustable lense hood because digital lenses have more coating on them because the silvery shiny sensor will reflect light back into the lense and the legacy are more prone to frontal glare also.  As for video I did not use it for that nor do I know what to compare it to. But from what I  have played with so far  it is suitable for any videos I may want to make and yes the button is too easy to activate and I have already acquired a few surprise videos. But I changed the function of this button to change the camera  to manual focus mode and  I have changed the function to RAW+JPEG or Preview or Face Detection off.  On the Face Detection mode issue the autofocus seems to be quicker and surer if it is off when not actually looking for faces. I purchased the audio mike adapter to enhance the resale value one day but haven't used it. When using legacy lenses you can select scene modes and set to Manual focus and then manually focus and adjust the aperature to get  the proper exposure but you must have the liveboost off that varies the LCD intensity and actually works better with the EVF. I have found the results produced by the scene modes excellent and I like being able to use legacy lenses with the Scene and Art Modes.  So my final verdict on the E-PL1? Autofocus issues?, yes the autofocus does not function well in low light. If you want a camera for fast action this is not for you. The JPEGS from this camera are excellent but I shoot RAW + JPEG  Large SF on the stills I use this for because I want to become knowledgeable at processing JPEGS and TIFF files.  I have read from others posting reviews that this is an excellent digital back for legacy lenses. I think this hits the nail right on the head. This is a camera that can wear many hats. With a 37mm and optical viewfinder it can be a rangefinder type street camera. with the 15mm lens cap lens a convienant  P&S; and with the EVF and adapters a DLSR using economical excellent legacy lenses.  The body has an excellent grip in my opinion. So for me it is an excellent camera for stills which is what I will use it for. For those wanting a camera for action shots look elsewhere. But with the EVF and legacy adapters  and lenses it is the size of a DLSR so knowing what I know I know now I probably would opt for a Pentax DLSR with the larger sensor and 1.5 crop factor and in body IS, also maybe a Sony using my K-mounts with adapters as it hs in body IS I believe. But for now I'm committed and am pleased with my photos which is what matters. As my shills grow and progress I will problably keep the pen system and maybe a E-PL5 with a 37mm and optical viewfinder to go with what I already have. But I do see a 24mp K3 Pentax in my future.

Whitney", "ReviewID": "R21MK3ZTFZ629J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After several point & shoots  wanted to upgrade to a better quality camera, but was worried that I would get one that was way beyond my abilities. This camera seemed like a good compromise. I have only had it for a few weeks, but I have been experimenting a lot with it. With point/shoot cameras there wasn't much to do, so I only used them when needed. The variety of controls on this camera inspires me to mess around with it a lot more. But when I need to snap a shot, the automatic settings make it easy. I look forward to being able to get new lenses for it when I improve my photo abilities. I can see what others are saying about the camera body being so small that larger lenses may make it harder to control/balance. It is a light, small camera that looks like a point/shoot with a lens added to it.What I like: The varying degrees of automatic shooting-> manual shooting. I can use it totally automatic, or choose to only set the aperture or shutter speed manually, or go totally manual. I think this will be quite helpful with learning. The ability to change lenses will come in handy later in my use of the camera. The video looks pretty good. Even though I have a Mac, I have no problem downloading images from the camera via the USB cable. The flash isn't exceptionally powerful, but does a good job. I dig the old-style look of the camera in champagne gold, which really just looks like textured aluminum. The custom settings make it easy to do cool effects like double-exposure and panoramic photos. Until I learn how to use the manual setting better, I was able to use the fireworks and candlelight settings to take some cool shots by a bonfire.What I don't like: I'd prefer an actual wheel to cycle through controls rather than the buttons, since I found myself accidentally pushing the buttons when taking shots. The stock camera only has the screen for seeing your shot, but it makes it hard to truly see the image in the sun. But the camera + viewfinder was out of my budget. The locking lens makes it hard to snap a shot quickly if the camera is put away. I find that the time for an image to save makes it difficult to shoot images quickly. Mind you, it does have the setting for taking multiple shots in bursts, but sometimes you need to just shoot another shot quickly, such as when you are taking a photo of a pet or a child & they aren't \"posing.\"Overall, I think this camera will be a great aid to improving my technique, and will deliver some great quality images along the way.", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "The E-PL1 is the perfect Assistant SLR. (or is it Assistant to the SLR :)", "Author": "Manish Bhatia", "ReviewID": "RI2TKP4LSH1TZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent several months on trying different cameras to co-reside with my trusty Kodak Z712 IS that was still producing wonderful pictures at a very high success rate. During the process I also learnt a lot about them and having kids, I was very interested in the quality aspect of the images since I did not want to lose the well, Kodak moments :)Just like most consumer electronics, everybody has different needs. I learnt that you cannot have everything in one camera because if you did, the industry would shut down and quit making any more upgrades.Here are some key things that I learnt that I want to share with people scratching their heads between cameras and SLRs vs P&S.;1)  It is ALL about the sensor. NO MATTER what P&S; you get, no matter what is built around it (touchscreen, front screen, a tank (G-10), uber zoom lens, you will ALWAYS be stuck with a small sensor compared to SLRs and therefore always have a liability in low light and high ISO pictures.You need to look at sensors like Dart Boards. Bear with me, I am trying to clarify this. Imagine you have two dartboards that you are aiming at. One is a much smaller dartboard where the circles of quality (points) are pretty small and one which is 7-8X times the size of the first dartboard with correspondingly larger circles including an easier to hit Bullseye (the best picture).The odds of you hitting the bullseye and high points on the second board will always be higher no matter how much you try to screw up. (auto modes). On the smaller board, you can still hit the bullseye but the chances are much lower UNLESS you shoot 50 darts at it (multi shot modes) and hope one sticks OR you are one of the best dart throwers in the business who knows all about wind speeds and trajectories and somehow manage to squeeze a high point shot frequently.So there you go. Either you need to be really good at the photo process (and speed of decision is critical sometimes at the perfect moment) or you simply take a high volume of shots and utilize the percentage of good to great shots you can get out of the bunch. Do not try to compare some random shot from a P&S; to a SLR because it just meant you happened to hit the bullseye somehow and not that they are equal by any means. SLRs will CONSISTENTLY out perform a P&S; for HQ pics.2) Portability - The best camera is the one with you. Unfortunately that means the cell phone for most people. However, the E-PL1 gives you hope to salvage the memories at a formal lunch or a party where unobtrusiveness is critical and you dont want to stick a huge SLR in someone's face. The kit lens is small, not very small but enough to avoid nervous glances anytime you try to click. Stick the pancake 20 mm Lumix Lens and they won't know what hit them. I consider SLRs to be EVENT based items where you have to plan to take them to a birthday function, wedding etc and its OK to have a piece of luggage with you while everyone else use a compact. The E-PL1 would make an Excellent Assistant SLR. (or is it Assistant to the SLR :)3) Price - while the price is reasonable for the basic lens kit it is not cheap and I agonized over the 20 mm LUMIX lens and finally got it since it is simply a match made for the EPL1 form factor with a huge low light advantage. However, you need to remember that a lot of P&S; lose value a lot quicker than SLRs that will take good pics no matter the date of manufacture. Since this is a new technology still evolving, your return on investment should be very good for this camera since it has all the necesssary features in it. (the next one could have a view finder, doubt it since the whole size thing would be compromised), there is already flash and high MP to take you through several years (get an accidental warranty and you might be set for much beyind in case something should happen to your camera and it is discontinued)4) Megapixels are a very misunderstood concept. On a P&S;, the higher the MP the more noise and issues at high ISO you will have since the PIXEL DENSITY is reduced (MP/Sensor size). That is why my 7 MP Kodak stays awesome for regular prints upto 8x10 since it does not falsely advertise its capabilities. A 12 MP on a small sensor on a P&S; is asking for trouble. The key in my (very limited) experience is that you need to use the Flash as little as possible and use natural light and proper framing and placement with minimal zoom (use your legs). As such high ISO usability is very important to get at least a nice 8x10 print if desired, 4x6 would be more common.The E-PL1 is fantastic at high ISOs and pictures are not burnt out by the flash5) Software/Editing is the main element of good digital photography and I am still a novice on this one so it is all the more critcal for me to have good art option ON BOARD the camera (stitching, diorama, sepia etc) This makes it a lot easier to see the after effect of the shot before it happens and saves you time later on the PC.RAW files while large and not commonly used by the average consumer are good to save for the important pics as a DIGITAL NEGATIVE if nothing else.So, after the long expose, here is the rundown.I ended up keeping the camera. I like my toys cheap and usable so its never easy for me to make a major purchase regardless if I have the money.I did not miss the view finder as much as I thought I would.Pictures are consistently good and the Olympus JPEG engine is awesome.I got the 20mm LUMIX pancake lens and use the flash as little as possibleThe art filters are great. The Sepia is a nicer type not the washed out brown pics like others.The cool/wow factor is high and will remain as such for the near future since its a new type of technology (not just model)Auto focus for the kit lens was improved with the firware upgrade but still not as speedy as you would likeThe 20 mm lens on the other hand.....This camera will need work for very young kids and pets that don't work as well with you for posing. 3-4 yr olds and above will be fine and there are burst options/modes you can play with to utilize the dart board theory to take multi-pics in those situations.Get a tripod for shots that you can plan out like in a glamor shop (makes you look cool and like a pro) and minimizes errors and blurs. Essential for night and fireworks etc. The 20 MM will give you some extra  help and onboard Image Stabilization will help as well on any lens.Oh, and I am actually having fun taking pics now. I am taking more random pics of my kids and ending up framing even the unplanned poses.

I have a Canon point and shoot that only had a 3x zoom and now that my kids are often on stage for school performances thought I needed something that would allow me to capture that.I was thinking about a Nikon or Canon \"superzoom\" since I don't see myself ever taking advantage of all the bells and whistles of a DSLR or shelling out the cash for the zoom lens I thought I'd need.However, even the superzooms were a bit out of my price range so I settled on a Panasonic with a 20x zoom that was much more pocket size and only cost around $180. There was a school performance the week that I got it so I tried it out. The results were not very good.While I hadn't considered a micro 4/3 camera, I happened to see this on sale. I also found the 40-150 lens .Olympus M.Zuiko 40-150mm f/4.0-5.6 R Micro ED Digital Zoom Lens (Black)on sale and all together the kit cost about the same as the higher end \"superzooms\" that I thought were what I was going to end up buyingA little reading on the web and a conversation with a guy at a camera shop convinced me that the image quality would be better with this camera so the only question was the zoom.I've now used this camera at the zoo and at a performance and am very happy with the results.So if you've ended up here as someone considering a superzoom, this camera with an additional lens may be an option. I've never had the highest end superzooms but this definitely beats the \"travel zoom\" that I had for about a week.One caveat, if you're not getting a good deal on this camera, it may make sense to look at DSLR's because I don't think the smaller size of this is such a big deal.

I have the same complaints about low light shooting and overall sharpness of image that many have written about. I am the type who shoots in the automatic modes almost always.I was attracted to the Olympus EPL-1 by a camera reviewing site on the web that was very detailed in it's analysis and which ended up giving it the highest rating for a lower priced camera (below some of the expensive $1200 plus DSLR's). So I tested it at a local camera store, went home and thought about it. The store even let me shoot some video and pics and bring them home on my own SD memory card. I looked at them over and over on my computer screen at home. The camera was noisy in the movie mode when zooming and shoots only 720 resolution. The outside pics were fine, but were in good light so I continued to have fear of low light performance. Finally, I purchased from the brick and mortar store because I had a 10 day window to return it.With that lead in, the downside to video is video shots cannot be too long or the camera heats up and shuts down. I have gotten about a minute out of it. Please don't buy it for video, if that is super important to you. Regarding some complaints I have seen about it not being 1080p -- high resolution video becomes a storage headache, and the lower resolution takes less hard drive space and looks quite clear for most viewing.The upside is that stills have been stunning in both resolution and color with the kit lens. I took it for a week to Seattle and British Columbia, Canada and it is great. I shot in fog, sun, midday and evening. Even took some night time harbour shots. All looked great. I do recommend down loading Microsofts free Windows Live Photo Gallery or better yet, Adobe Lightroom or some form of photo processing (I would say this for all cameras). Such software is an extension of any camera and as important in some ways as the camera itself.The EPL-1 is super light to carry and fits a smaller bag, although it is not a pocket camera.I have checked some of the flickr photos taken with this camera and other cameras and find the images on the EPL-1 compare quite well.

Epperson\"", "ReviewID": "R1FAHBREUM3AOB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I sold my olympus e-510 last spring and have been waiting for olympus to come out with a better camera than the e-620. but when it was apparent that wasnt going to happen any time soon I had to have some kind of camera or I was going to go crazy! along comes the pen, and since I still had my Olympus 50mm macro, my 12-60 zoom, and my 70-300mm zoom lenses and this camera is supposed to be able to use these with the adapter, I thought o.k. sounds good lets give this a try in the interim while waiting for an upgrade to the e-620. Well here is what I have found to be, in my opinion, practically useless. As long as you are using the kit zoom that comes with this camera focusing is a nightmare. with the kit zoom the lens will focus and lock-in relatively quick, within a second or less. but no matter which one of my full size lenses I use it takes this camera from 4 or 5 full seconds to focus and lock-in! that is just ridiculously long. and on top of that you will be lucky if the camera has actually focused accurately, so it is impossible to have any confidence at all in whether your going to get a good picture or not when using any lens other than the ones specifically made for this camera! In addition this camera does not allow you to have any control over the ISO, the default is ISO 200, however when you are taking pictures and are in automatic the camera will set all three of the following, shutter speed, F-stop - and the ISO. you never know what the camera is going to choose! So when I wanted to use my 70-300 zoom with an f-5.6 - I needed to make sure the ISO was relatively high to keep the shutter speed up, but even in bright sunlight this camera simply refused to allow the focus to take any less than 5 seconds - then more often than not it would not let me take a picture because it was saying there was not enough light even in very bright sunlight! UNBELIEVABLE. Now if I could manually set the ISO to a highr range this should solve this problem but you cannot manually set the ISO! Now it may be the battery is not really big enough to allow my regular lenses to focus and operate properly, maybe, I dont know but there is no way I can use any of my lenses with any confidence at all that I will even get a picture let alone the fact that even when I do it must be a non-living or non-moving item because it takes soooooooo long to focus. In addition I took this to the beach the other day and even with the kit lens, thier was a guy sitting on the beach and he had been feeding the seagulls, so he must have had at least 300 birds at his feet. well at one point they all began to fly off, so I quick took a shot, then waited and waited and waited till the camera finally finished writing the picture to the card ( while your waiting the screen freezes and you just have to wait to take a second picture) by the time the camera finally let me take a second shot, all the 300 of the birds were gone baby gone! again RIDICULOUS! I give this camera 3 stars only because when you finally do get a picture taken the image quality is great. all my shots were taken with middle setting for quality - so I could go down in quality 2 notches or up in quality 2 notches with the best being in raw ( god only knows how long it would take this camera to write a raw image to the card, you could probably call your girlfriend while you wait! the screen is totally un-useable in any normal outside daylight - you cant see what the heck you are trying to focus on. - I will get rid of this pretty quick and just go ahead and buy the E620 at least I know that will work right the way it is suppose to, this camera does not. if you are hell bent on buying this anyway, you go girl! But make sure you only use the lens's that are actually made for this camera and dont believe for a second if you allready own any Olympus Lens's that the regular lenses are going to work for you - good luck and good night! - Ken Of Gulf Shores", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "E-PL1", "Author": "R.

M Ullman \"chimayred\"", "ReviewID": "RQWTDZVI7N1EF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Review of the Olympus E PL1 vs. canon G10:I'm a 54 year enthusiast and over the years I've owned a Canon Ftbn 35mm with a Hoya 35-105 zoom, a Ricoh point & shoot 35mm, and in the digital era I owned the original Sony Mavica, a Toshiba 2mp camera, and then a series of Fuji's culminating in an F30, F40 fd, F200 EXR, a Lumix FZ28 (clearly inferior picture quality to my F40FD).  Frankly and a testimony to my mediocre skills, despite having great cameras the best pics I've ever shot were with the Fuji F30, remarkable low light, fantastic battery life, just impeccable.  A few years later I bought a Nikon D40 and then after beginning to date a fellow enthusiast who already owned a G10, I finally realized that her pictures were invariably better (could she just be more talented?) and bought a G10 myself.  I, like many enthusiasts, am always in pursuit of the ideal camera and I like the idea of a larger sensor.  So I ran into some $$, sold my F30 and F200 and just bought a black Olympus E PL1 with the 14-42 kit  lens.I got it yesterday, and I have shot 100 pics on it, mostly backyard stuff, some close up flowers, and then today went down to Casco bay and took a bunch of late afternoon sunset shots with both camera.  I tried to take identical shots with identical settings  -  wide landscapes with auto, program, and landscape settings, a few closeups, played with some of the variables but each time I took a shot, I tried to match the program, focal length, white balance, etc as best as I could.There is no question that the Canon is the far more versatile camera.  I won't get into fit, finish, and feel, although I am in love with the Canon for those reasons.  The Olympus is nicely styled and feels great too.  But you can do things with the Canon you can't with the Oly.  For example, you can pretty much do \"closeup\" with almost any program on the G10.  On the Olym, if you want to take a closeup, you go to the Scene setting, pick Macro and that is your closeup setting.  You can't vary things like white balance when you do that.  Similarly, if you pick an art filter like \"pop art\" you can't put it on a close up setting, bracket it, or change metering.  I emailed Olympus and they couldn't/wouldn't tell me how close you could focus, so I have no idea whether you can get a good closeup with that setting.  The amount that you can tweak various programs is much better with the Canon, going away....No comparison.  On the easy mode settings on the Olympus - Scene, Art, and auto, you pretty much get what the default settings are.The EPL1 interface takes some getting used to.  The pick lists aren't as confusing as some say; it is pretty typical computer type interface and it wasn't that tough to learn.  The Epl1 is definitely more of a point and shoot.  It doesn't seem nearly as versatile.  The kit lens feels a little shaky, physically, but of course the G10 is a fixed zoom, so to speak, not interchangeable, so it is not apples to apples.  My Nikon has a Tamron zoom which feels like a rock.  So I can't really comment on other lenses for the Olympus.  It has the equivalent of a 28-84 zoom on a 35mm.  Limited, pretty similar to the kit lens on the Nikon D40, whereas the Canon G10 is a 5:1 zoom.The basic pictures were comparable.  I took a few landscapes then blew up various parts.  I could see my car in the lot a hundred feet away, and when I put the pics side by side and zoomed them, the Canon was clearly sharper.  I don't know if that is good or bad, knowing that \"noise\" can make things appear sharper.  But I was surprised, considering the fact that you can fit what - 2-3 of the Canon sensors in the Olympus?  Now, as a caveat, I can't tell you whether they were on identical focal lengths, although the pictures were similar.  And there were a few pics where the Olympus was definitely sharper, including a close up.These are zooms, Olympus on left, canon on right.The originals are below.  Maybe it is me; I think the Canon is sharper.  Materially?  I can't tell. Olympus CanonHere's another where the Oly has a slight edge: Olympus Canon  Olympus  CanonSlight edge to Olympus, although I realize this isn't quite apples to apples.  And BTW, I made sure both were on highest pixel and fineness settings.  If you blow this up even more, there is just loads of noise on the canon, and the roof and lines on the Olympus blow it away.Here's one for Canon:Olympus  CanonOK, I realize that the exposure can affect \"sharpness\" and resolution etc.  Look at the license plates on the zoomed images below:Close.  The Olympus is on the left, Canon on the right.  The grill is a little clearer on the E PL1, the license plate #'s are clearer on the Canon.  I guess I was expecting to be bowled over by the micro 4/3 sensor.  Not.  Overall, I think the exposure and color rendition was excellent on both; slight edge to Canon (the color of my car is more accurate on the Canon, although that could definitely be from my tweaking the color saturation on the Olympus on this pic.Other \"pluses\" for the Canon, of course, are the flash - if on auto, it will go off as needed whereas you need to \"pop\" it on the Olympus.  I think the Canon's art filters, Color Swap, Color Accent, and the manual dials give you not only more flexibility, but easier and more intuitive use.  I haven't quite figured out some of the settings on the EPL1 yet, like after you take a shot, the pic stays on the screen until you depress the shutter button again, but I think that might change as I get to know it better.  And I like the fact that it has interchangeable lenses.  Canon has the viewfinder, a plus for it, and I do use it, although with the Fuji's I never missed it and am quite used to shooting just with the LCD.  The Oly has the instant video button and HD, the Canon does not.  Although I haven't used it, it seems the video capabilities, Image stabilization, and multiple exposure settings on the Olympus are nice pluses, perhaps better than the Canon.  There are a few more settings, like more bracketing choices (focal length) on the Olympus.  At this time, I think I understand the choices for bracketing and exposure control better with the Canon.  The Canon's LCD is clearly superior to my eye than the Olympus'.  A couple other things?  Can't put a protective filter on the Canon, you can on the Olympus, and the grip is better on the Canon.It is too early to tell, but I was clearly more impressed with the flexibility, build, versatility, and ease of use with the Canon.  Initially I expected to be wowed with the picture quality of the Olympus, considering the sensor size and I was, but not when I compared them side to side.  I knew much of this up front from reviews, but the reviews uniformly raved about the picture quality of the Olympus, comparing it favorably to the Panasonic GF1.  I figured that was the bottom line, and if I was going to get better pics I'd be happy regardless of ergonomics and specs.  Bottom line for me is picture quality.  I'm not disappointed in the Olympus, just surprised how extraordinary the Canon is.Right now, day 1, if I only had to pick one, I'd go with the Canon.  Price was roughly the same - $500 for the Canon, $550 with kit lens for Olympus.  Perhaps I will change my mind after using it, and after getting a replacement lens.  Then it'll be interesting to see how it stacks up against my 6mp Nikon D 40.  But if I could get over my affection for coolness, gadgetry, versatility, and heft, I'd probably kill to get a new in the box F30 again.UPDATE:  Well.  I've had this Olympus for about 3 months, I guess.  I just came back from a week long trip to Belgium and shot over 1000 pics, about 600 with my Canon G10 (because it was more compact and I had spare batteries for it) and 400 on the Oly.  Before I went, I reviewed a dummies book for the EPL-1, and it really helped.  I learned a lot more about the controls and features.  I also brought my beloved Canon G-10.  Here's the con on the Olympus.  IT doesn't sync flash greater than 1/160.  That's it.  I bought the 14-150 Olympus micro 4/3 lens.  I am in awe of this camera.  Only other con is that the screen isn't quite as remarkable as the Canon.So I took pics with the P setting, the Auto setting, used the scene settings mostly on night time, night portrait, landscape.  Loved the one touch video function.  Loved it (once I figured out how to do it) getting the super screen that gives you ALL the attributes of each modality.  Flash was fine.  And the pictures.  Oh, man, the pictures.  Night pics on a tripod.  Indoor cathedrals hand held at 1/8 sec.  Low light shots.  Restaurant and food pics.  Pics while driving.  landscapes.  Self portraits.  They are so sharp, so brilliant.  This will become my primary camera.  The G 10 is of course more compact, and has a few features I really like, like color accent.  They are really complementary, the Canon I think has more features, but with the zoom and the bigger sensor, the Oly pics were slightly better.  Also, for night shots, the Olym just goes to at least 6 seconds.  I got amazing shots of Brussels in the middle of the night with a tripod and very long exposure, at ISO 100 with almost no noise.  Canon only goes to a max of 1 second without a real complex workaround.  The real answer is that this just about has sealed the fate of my Nikon D40.  I would have no problems recommending this camera, and in fact am trying to convince my girlfriend to forego her SLR dreams and just go to this format.  Would I like a more powerful flash?  Yes, but it wasn't an issue.  Not once.  Would I like a viewfinder?  Yes, but it wasn't an issue, and in fact I had a viewfinder on the Canon and never used it.  Of the 400 pictures i bet maybe 10 were disappointments.  I persoally would spring for the 14-150 lens, but quality wise, the kit lens is terrific (although I just personally don't see the value of a 3x zoom).  Whether or not this is a price performer when you spend $900 for the lens & body is beyond me, but I can tell you, these are easily the best quality pictures I have ever taken (with the exception of my beloved Fuji F30).  If the flash/viewfinder and some of teh bells & whistles are not an issue do not think twice about buying this.

I had a chance to buy one for the same price. Well, I got it today, and I must say - what a DISAPPOINTMENT, it went back to store 2 hours later. Camera runs on 1.1 version firmware and  1.0 version 14-42mm Zuiko kit lens.Pros:1) Colors are good and realistic.2) Pictures are well balanced.3) Mono mic sound good.and that's about it, now the CONS:1) LCD screen quality is horrible it is 230K compared 460K on Sony.2) Auto Focus is horrible at low light, try to take a picture in dark room the flash wouldn't fire unless it's in focus and no way it can focus in a room without light, my Sony did it in no problem, it fire the flash and taking the picture, so the thing is \"No focus = No flash!!!\" Really.... Frustrated!!3) Because of the focus issue pictures are blurry in low light (Pets, People, etc. anything that moves) stills are good though.4) Horrible Video quality!! Camera wouldn't focus you should constantly press the \"Shutter\" button so that camera can focus!!! Really....5) Mic sound on video is good, but it is mono though, Sony has stereo.6) Panorama mode called \"DO-it-Yourself\" where you have post processing (it will take you about 10min), with Sony it is snap, camera does it for you!So the conclusion this camera is for shooting the Landscapes during the day daylight.P.S.

Duro \"Mr Gadget\"", "ReviewID": "R1CD6DVQN2NBKQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera without any bias. I was hopeful that this could be the price point and upgrade in technology that I was looking for. But I was ultimately disappointed. THe auto-focus issues are overwhelmingly obvious, and the LCD shutdown lag between shots make this camera feel like an downgrade. I compared this camera to a GF1 and was shocked by the difference. I brought my e PL1 into samy's store and compared the two. I have concluded that Olympus had created a camera that has set the micro 4/3 camera concept backwards, all the way back to the beginning.The E pl1 lacks in almost every department, and if you are not impressed by this, then you have to be an incurable Olympus fanboy to be sure. It is not just that the auto focus issues, but the LCD resolution, which is awful compared to the Panasonic GF1, but is is the over all feel and weight. The New Olympus menu system is flakey, there is too much jumping back and forth... It really is not a very well thought out concept- in practice, it is irritating. This camera felt like an overpriced point and shoot. YIKES!THe GF1 killed the Epl1, and I was overtaken by buyers remorse. Luckily I was able to send this e Pl1 back for a refund. If you have time to do this before it is too late to return your E Pl1, then I would highly recommend it. The Panasonic GF! prices have been dropping for a couple months now, and can be had for less then $150  more than the E Pl1. The GF1 is twice the camera as the E Pl1, this is a very good investment, and I highly recommend it.I made comments about Olympus before and I was ridiculed for having the audacity to talk bad about the cameras performance, well here is proof that Olympus has some pretty substantial issues with its cameras. I will quote Lori Grunin from Cnet (senior editor). Seems Olympus themselves are admitting that they messed up and are now trying to go backwards and correct their problems. THis makes me very happy I am not an Olympus customer. She says \"there is a lot to like\". but in reality she is trying to put a happy face on it, in order to ease into her real distain for the platform, IMO. This is only one issue that Olympus has overtly come out to address. They have a long way to go before I ever look at their products again!In the mean time I am loving my New Panasonic GF1!.. See below;\"There's lots to like about Olympus' Micro Four Thirds cameras--the E-P1, E-P2 and E-PL1--but their seriously slow autofocus performance, most notably with nonprime lenses, can be a significant drawback for many casual users who rely on AF. The firmware update released this Thursday is yet another attempt on Olympus' part to bring performance for its entire PEN series into line with competitors from Panasonic and Samsung.In addition to addressing AF speed for still capture for all the models, the firmware upgrade also tries to get a handle on the E-P2 and E-PL1's AF tracking accuracy--that is, the tendency for the autofocus in those models to lose lock when they're supposed to be tracking, which is especially painful when shooting movies. That fix seems limited to the newer, as yet unavailable 9-18mm (read about it) and 14-150mm internal-focusing lenses. (A third new capability allows E-P2 and E-PL1 shooters with the EVF to use the LCD and EVF simultaneously, a much-requested feature according to Olympus.)Olympus sent us an E-P2 body with a beta version of the firmware to see for ourselves. The results? In our Labs tests, the new firmware did deliver about a 22 percent improvement in shot lag--the time it takes to focus and shoot--under optimal, high-contrast conditions. However, that drop went from 0.9 second to 0.7 second, in a class of products that routinely take 0.5 second. We saw no improvement in low-contrast (dim) light. (Tested using the 14-42mm kit lens.) And according to Matt Fitzgerald, who does our labs testing, it's still inconsistent, taking varying amounts of time to lock on a subject during repeated trials.In practice, and with the faster 9-18mm lens, the E-P2 did feel zippier, with more decisive autofocus. But it still hunted more than I'd like.If you've already got a PEN camera, the firmware update should offer a definite improvement over your camera's current performance. But based on the beta's performance, I don't think it will significantly improve Olympus' performance standing relative to its competitors, though I suppose every little bit helps. Olympus doesn't plan to release the upgrade until April 22 (from [...]), so maybe there's some room for more tweaking. On the bright side, Olympus has overhauled its firmware upgrade process so you no longer have to boot up the Olympus Master software you probably never installed; it will do it directly via the Web instead.\" Lori Grunin, Cnet senior editor.", "Date": "April 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "good but dont get caught by customs tax!", "Author": "C.

Duro \"Mr Gadget\"", "ReviewID": "R14KGIT5D22743", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had high hopes for this camera. I brought no bias into this purchase/evaluation, as a mater of fact. I anticipated this camera, but was only slightly concerned about the low res smaller LCD in the back. However, once I got it in the mail, I opened it and was struck by its over-all small size. Although I do have manly hands, they are not huge- and this camera was a little on the small side for me. The LCD in the back did look too small, and once I started using it, it became an issue that I could not overlook. The auto-focus points and timing were flakey, and the screen fluctuated back and forth from bright to dim every time I tried to take a shot. Additionally, the resolution on this LCD is lower than most good point and shoot, (230K 2.7 inch  Vs 3 inch 460K)- and the irony is that micro four-thirds LCD is supposed to be state of the art- whereby- the lens optics is supposed to be brought to this screen- you know- as a viewfinder. I am a little insulted that Olympus decided to keep such low resolution for this smaller screen- especially when you need to depend on it for your shots, it is an essential and fundamental aspect of the 4/3 camera- so why cheap out?!The kit lens is plasticly-- but it does retract which is nice for stowing. I was a little concerned about the autofocus initially, so I brought it over to Samy's and compared it to the Panasonic GF1- side by side. The guy who was helping me was a rep for Olympus years back, so He was happy to see an Olympus customer. However, his enthusiasm was shallow in light of the comparison right in front of me. The GF1 killed the Olympus- I was soon overcome with the feeling that I bought the wrong camera. THe more photos I took, the more I fell in love with the GF1, but I was torn from buyers remorse.I think that Olympus made a mistake and possibly set the micro 4/3 camera category back 2 years with this attempt to cheapen the design and cutting corners. In this economy- companies should be trying to give people more for their money, not less. Not withstanding the fancy-smancey art filters-effect- I still felt like I was playing around with a Sony camera that was desperately trying to justify the $600. (besides, these fancy effects made the handling tricky and time consuming) I am insulted by this tact. I don' know if I will forgive Olympus for trying this marketing ploy/strategy- and don't misunderstand me-- this camera was designed by the marketing department, and not the engineers, or real photographers.I know that most reviews you read on the internet are laden with bias, and extremes- and that you can hardly believe anything that anybody says anymore. My 27 inch iMac for instance. I was terrified to buy one because of all the gadget geeks were screaming about the screen failures-- But I ignored them and finally bought one. I love this mac- and feel abused by all the idiot chatter.So, what do I think about this camera- I felt ripped off, and that I had nothing but an expensive bulked up point and shoot that could not hold a candle to the Panasonic GF1- and for the extra $150- I went ahead and bought the GF1 - while getting a refund from this camera.
