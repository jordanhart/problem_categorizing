{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An awesome camera with great performance.", "Author": "Avi Mediratta", "ReviewID": "R1MSVN1759WNA9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has unbeatable results with a very few cons.First starting with a few technical qualities I liked the most.Pros(1) Superb low light performance with reduced noise at very high ISO.(2) Comes with super intelligent Digic 5+ which gives ultimate color catch.(3) Faster FPS than 5D MK2.(4) The L mount 24-105 f/4 lens gets it as an add on with the already great performance.(5) In-built GPS for geo tagging.(6) Comes with W-Fi that makes it convenient for us to share the photographs immediately with the client using online sharing.Cons(1) AF points are lesser than the competitor makes.(2) Flash sync X at 1/180 on paper but practically its 1/160.(3) No build-in flash as given in competitor makes.Now on performance basis.Pros(1) I was almost stunned with it focusing even under very low light conditions such as partial moon light.(2) The noise control was too good even at ISO 20000. It was similar to what the competitor makes giving noise at 12800.(3) light weight to its competitor makes. So it makes slightly easy to shoot with super tele-lenses when shooting for a longer duration.(4) The colors were same as when seen with eyes (One needs to use the K option to set the desired white balance instead of presets).Cons(1) The position of the DoF preview is a bit odd (though not inconvenient, but diff than the other canon makes and thus one needs a few trials before getting hands on it).(2) The 1/160 flash sync limits us to fast moving objects to capture without flash when at events.Over all the camera is the most recommended entry level full frame. And when choosing between 5D Mk2 and 6D... Definitely 6D", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera - Accessories are worthless", "Author": "Mark Stpehenson", "ReviewID": "RSGZSOSXZI1PO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera and lens are teriffic.

I am happy I ordered it from Amazon because it was $100 cheaper than getting it locally even after shipping cost. The 64GB cards really makes it easier to do full photoshoots in RAW. The tripod and other items were neat add ons but not deal makers.My only concern is the extra battery. The charger blinks very fast as if it is rejecting the battery. It functioned normally with the Canon branded one. I am going to drain the battery and try to charge it again. If it doesn't work I will be disappointed but not with my over all purchase since it was really just a free ad on.As for the Camera and lens combo.

Just check out the reviews for the main product and on photography websites.Since the only difference between the vanilla Canon 6D kit sold directly by Amazon and this bundle are the extra accessories (yes, this camera is the official US model with the original Canon warranty!), I will briefly comment on them.- Extra battery:Not original Canon, but is recognized by the camera and the charger. After several cycles of charging, and actually using it \"out there\", still no difference. Same endurance, same charging behaviour. The camera does not even seem to see that it is not a genuine Canon battery. Definitely a great plus.- Memory card:Original Transcend class 10 as on the photos. Works perfectly. You could buy a faster one, but I am not sure it makes a very big difference since the 6D itself does not shoot faster than 4 frames per seconds until buffer is full, and will have to write to card after that anyway. Of course, that writing process will be faster with a faster card, but not by much (websites and forums seem to argue a lot about this) since Canon's internal interface does not give you full speed anyway, unfortunately. That is why I am still deciding what additional cards I will buy...- The USB reader:Just what I needed for my PC. Only USB 2.0 though, just like the camera, but works fine.- Cleaning kit:The little air blower is always helpful if you dont have one.The rest, I do not use, since I have better equipment, but as freebies they can be of use for some: The screen protector has to be cut to fit. I am using one of the custom glass ones to put on top that you can get on Amazon as well. The bag is fine as a spare or for storage. The tripod works, and can hold the camera, but of course it is cheap and not stable enough for windy outdoor use. Fine for controlled, quiet shots though. The memory card pouch is just that, nice that it is so small.Overall:If the price difference to the pure kit on Amazon is not too big (when I bought, they were exactly the same price), you cannot go wrong with this bundle, it is definitely worth it for the battery and card alone, and thus a no-brainer....unfortunately, the price for the whole thing dropped by a hundred dollars shortly after my purchase... but that is a different story.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camera, junk accessories", "Author": "C.
