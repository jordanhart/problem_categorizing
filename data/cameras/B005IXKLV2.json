The photos are clear and etc.  I was not certain if I should get the A77 or A65 but I am happy with the a65 choice that I made.  I've taken the camera on a couple of trips & for events and I'm able  to relive  these great memories thanks to the aid of this camera.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent package deal", "Author": "MScott", "ReviewID": "R12810K8OWDYDV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a review of the Willoughby's package deal, not of the Sony A65.  If you want a review of the camera, better photographers than me have done so all over the internet.As far as I can tell, this is the best package deal available for the A65 with 18-55mm lens.All of the extras are of very high quality.The bag is a Sony brand camera bag that retails for $60.  It works great.The tripod/monopod is very sturdy and well constructed.  It normally sells for $35.The SD card is fast, and can hold about 600 RAW + Jpeg shots, or a couple thousand JPEG's.Between all of the different cleaning kits this came with, I have enough microfiber cloths to last me a lifetime.My favorite thing is probably the mini tripod, which is great for use on a tabletop.Everything came well packaged.I could not be happier with all of the extras in this kit.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005IXKLV2"}}
