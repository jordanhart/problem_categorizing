Had to drill holes and attach the hanger on the bottom to make it the top. The camera swivels great and reverses great, we can see all of two side of the house and yard for each camera. Biggest problem is the remotes are prone to break. The switch is a small spring and doesn't last long. We have had to buy another unit just to get the remote. Company needs to make the remote better and sell it separate.", "Date": "April 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "For the price it's a great pan base. I use it for my Uniden security camera", "Author": "Sam G", "ReviewID": "R3DE8QFHEHV8ZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Securityman Pan base had me surprised as it exceeded my expectations, I've owned cheap pan remote controlled bases in the past, this one is better than them by far. I do not own a Securityman camera that the mounting bracket was designed for, but it didn't matter, I used a Uniden UDWC23 Wireless Video Surveillance Accessory Portable Indoor Camera (Black)& I affixed the wireless camera to the Securityman base and it works perfectly.  I just bought a new home that has a 77' screened in lanai in the shape of an L and I wanted to be able to watch my cat while at work to make sure he didn't try to escape from the new home. (indoor only cat)  I had two options, buy another uniden camera for $100, or buy a pan remote controlled base, I made the right choice as this product worked perfectly for my needs, no more rear of the home blind spots my security cam can't see.Not to mention, my cat loves his new 77' lanai, my old lanai was 12' long, the Securityman has 370* coverage, I can remotely look at whatever my cat is looking at from my home office. This is a good product well worth the $29 plus shipping", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "POOR QUALITY AND WILL NOT WORK WITH LOREX CAMERA..", "Author": "christ", "ReviewID": "R27XN35NGH6IE6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I BOUGHT 3 OF THESE AND AFTER THEY GOT HERE I FOUND OUT THAT THE ROMOTE FROM,ONE MAKES ALL 3 MOVE AT THE SAME TIME AND WHEN I CONNECTED THE PAN SYSTEM TO MY LOREX CAMERA WITH THE POWER SUPPLY FROM MY CAMERA .

I got this to increase security down the side of my house. With having roommates I had a lot of people invited over that could not be trusted...and later they came back to rob me and everytime my system has helped from me getting fully cleared out. (Had my video setup hooked up through a proxy to send picture messages of event triggers of possible break ins)I loved the fact that it was on a remote so when i heard something outside I could stay put and just look over at the security screen and watch as the camera is panning over the yard and side yard. I had multiple cameras setup but this really helped close all the gaps were there was no coverage.The one thing I did not like is the casing design. make sure the base sits flat and is not going to get rained on or have water run down the wires and feed into the Pan Base. Every once and a while the camera would stop panning. once I moved and uninstalled it i realized that water ran down the cord and into the housing...which filled up with water and would short everyonce and a while. Still works! just make sure its in a dry location. Oh and the range on the remote is pretty good. I would guess its equal to any 900mhz wireless transmission range.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "I have to change my opinion about this device", "Author": "DCW2", "ReviewID": "R1B5VT1KXVNMZW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I used to like it, but this is my 3rd purchase and I am tired of forgiving my purchases.
