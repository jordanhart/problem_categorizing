{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Stay away.  low quality, not a good value", "Author": "AZ76737 \"amazon76737\"", "ReviewID": "R1LBLCCJX8OQOJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was in the market for an ip camera.  I bought cameras from Panasonic, a Cisco VC220, and an Axis P1344.  I found that it is very difficult to estimate the quality of these products without trying them or knowing the market well.I was looking for a high end solution to (1) monitor a vacant home and (2) use as a high end baby monitor.Here is my experience:* If you are looking for a high end ip camera, go with cameras made by Axis.  They blew away the Cisco, Panasonic and Vivotek models I tried.  They are also more expensive, but it is worth the money in my opinion.  The quality of the software, image, and hardware was higher across the board.  No, I don't work for them.* The Vivotek was the worst value of all the cameras I tried.* I thought the Cisco VC220 was decent if you don't want to pay up for an Axis camera.  The Cisco software is pretty good.  The Cisco tech support isn't very helpful based on my experience w/ a small issue.  Got passed from person to person, and the product expert never called me back as promised.", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Other features built into the Vivotek IP7131 network camera include an LED system status indicator, audio support, intelligent motion detection, and a digital input/output interface for an external sensor and alarm\nDigital input and output for external sensor and alarm\n16-channel recording software is also included", "Name": "Vivotek FD7131 Indoor Fixed Dome Camera with 1/4-Inch (White)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51faVsUleDL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000Y16US6"}}
