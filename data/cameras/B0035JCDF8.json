I MUCH prefer my old Lumix as it took excellent photos (though it shutter button and protective lens has a tendency to be temperamental over time.)As a part time photographer, I would never recommend this camera to even a novice.  While the size is great, spec look great on paper and is quite portable, all that goes out the window if it only half your photos will be in focus.Pass on this one!", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "I LOVE this camera !!", "Author": "Timothy Bennett \"Electronics dreamer t.j.\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZQGTJ27W2DRT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my Fuji Finepix JX250 today,and i absoulutely love it so far! Its very portable,fits great in my pocket,it looks really nice,although i did think it would look more metalic based on the pics online.I upgraded from a z30 to this one and im glad i did! The z30 was only 10 MP and i thought the pics came out great,buti can definately tell the difference in the MP. The JX250 takes great pics! They are colorful,and really crisp and clear looking! The cameras zoom is great also,you can zoom in the full 5Xs and the pic doesnt look any different! One thing that i noticed is that the HD video option only allows a 59 second movie,idk if there is a way to change this yet,or maybe its something to do with my SD card since its only a 256MB,which i am hoping to upgrade to a 2G really soon! But so far this camera is all i hoped it would be.If ur someone that needs a somewhat bulky camera to feel its durable,then u might not want this camera because its only almost 2 inches wide,and only almost 6 inches long,but if u really want a camera that takes really good pics,and fits easily in ur pocket or purse then i would recommend this camera. Its very eay to use as well!", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "14 Mega Pixel Capture Unfortunatley only a 2 Mega Pixel quality lens", "Author": "Troxel", "ReviewID": "R2I1AZAAK97V2U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Wow, I am underwhelmed with this camera and the poor optical quality of the lens.Yes it will capture a 14 mega pixel image (and create *huge* image files to fill up the memory card - which is NOT included), but the resolution of the lens delivers an image with the quality of a 2 megapixel camera.The lens is not sharp at any focal length. Enlargements? don't even think about bigger than an 8X10 - especially if you will also be cropping the image.I have 4 digital cameras, all point and shoots.  Of the 4, this camera produces the poorest quality pictures - yet it has the highest megapixel rating.I would not recommend this camera.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this piece of crap camera", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R1AMM2LMK4P12", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased this camera before we left for a vacation based on the price for the 14 megapixels. Within two days of receiving it, the shutter of the camera would not close, making the camera unusable. We sent it back to Fuji Canada, and they provided an estimate for the repairs saying we had damaged the camera, even though we had taken a total of 10 pictures. After two months, we do not have a camera and have lost around $180 + shipping. There are a ton of entry-level cameras right around this price range, and I recommend people considering a point and shoot camera should look at a Canon Powershot or a Panasonic Lumix (both of which we have been really pleased with in the past). This camera has a lot less features than those other models, and based on our experience, I hope I can talk at least one person out of buying this camera.

Fits in my pocket, light, takes photos quickly, lots of options but sorted out into easy to use way (most times Auto is all you need). I took night photos (firework show), dimly lit rooms, daylight, clouds, rain, etc.  All came out beautiful. What more can I say, fast, easy, light, many options there if you choose to use them...a great camera. I knew someone who bought a camera just before I got this one, and after using theirs returned it and got this one. They too have been happy ever since.

I've had it for several weeks and have taken tons of pictures and uploaded them and everything. It works wonderfully for me, and I LOVE the panoramic shot option. It is fantastic.

Used to have a Nikon until it broke and I had to get a new one. I decided to get this at Costco and man am I pleased!To start off, the weight of this camera is awesome. It is super light and very comfortable to carry around, especially with the leather carrying case with belt hook included! The size of it fits comfortably in my hand also, as it seems to curve at just the right points to hold it steady. Keep in mind that it is plastic, but its durable enough to take a fall, i know lol. The screen on it is also impressive, measuring about 3\" diagonally, and is very clear and crisp.The modes on it are a tad confusing but easy to get used to, especially if you use the auto mode, which does everything for you. The responsiveness of the camera is also a plus because within a second it is up and ready to shoot, perfect for those spontaneous pictures. The battery is included with the piece is a 3.7 volt rechargeable battery that will last for an easy week with daily use, or for a good amount of months if not. With it also it comes with a 4gb sd memory card so you can start shooting right away. The video I use now and then. I have to admit, for a 720p hd video for such a small camera, that's awesome. Everytime that I use it, I am extremely pleased with the playback quality and the picture and sound is very crisp(and there isn't any internal noise in the camera either)!Overall, a great deal for a camera if you want something simple and functional!I'll try to post some pictures of it and what it can do soon!", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good camera, but...", "Author": "Lucile Cheng \"cat slave\"", "ReviewID": "R18K4Z20DX7K2X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had mine for over a year.  It takes great pix, and simply amazing videos!  I subtracted two stars because it drains batteries so quickly.  I cannot leave home without having first charged the battery in use, PLUS an extra fully charged battery.

But that is all you get!  If you want to properly use it you WILL need the following items/or variants of the cards, several batteries, in home, in car, even Euro chargers, but not them all together in one purchase and they omit the most vital item, the USB camera > computer cable is a must-have gizmo!Here goes:1. \"FUJI BC-45 Equivalent External AC DC Mini Charger for NP-45 Battery used with FinePix / FujiFilm J10 / J20 / J250* / Z10fd / Z20fd / Z30 / Z33 / J26 / J27 / J30 / J35 / Z31 / Z35 / Z37 & Other FinePix Digital Cameras. Includes USB Port and Cable for Charging USB Enabled Cell Phones ** Cable NOT for PC / Photo transfer\"  If I wanted a catch-all 12V charger I would have bought one in Radio-Shack, but this seems to be a vital add-on, even if U fry your computer when U plug it in :-($16.99 (Sold by: Accessory Genie).2. 1 \"Fujifilm NP-45 Lithium Ion Rechargeable Battery for Fuji Z & J Series Digital Cameras\" $10.75 (Sold by: Argent Electronics).3. You can go with the add-on memory (an older version) Amazon suggests for this model: a Fujifilm 4 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card \u00a9 for $11.71, or if you want to fill it up with twice the JPG's or AVI HD videos you can get a \"Fujifilm 8 GB Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) Class 6 Flash Memory Card\". (Sold by: Amazon.com, LLC for $23.42) I checked the Fuji homepage URL and that card will hold the extra GB's of memory with no problem, a card-reader would be nice, but all you will find a 2.0 USB cable with an atypical plug-in (firewire style?) to transfer your work, no mention of a software interface prog that most new digital cameras have to pull the raw material off the camera into the computer for storage/tweaking/uploading/sharing. I'll figure something out or this Edsel goes back!4. And I may need 240-volts DC in the EU or 120-Volts AC back home and have a juiced-up cell phone to tell all my M8's all about the great pictures I took!  No case/carrier; (that's extra$ as are lens cleaning gizmos, and better than multi manufacturer warranties that run from 'as-is' to 3 years) I think I have all my bases covered, but Amazon.com if you are going to sell a camera, at least have the common-sense to list the bare-bones vital augments that make it work... ya think? Slight oversights that Amazon.com may wish to include into a bundled deal for folks who don't want to have to place a rush 2nd order when their dream camera shows up to get it working, then get their bit by bit shipments C/O several vendors showing up over a 5 [working day] period of staying home to sign for the very small packages that arrive in dribs & drabs from 9am to 7pm by FedEx or UPS.  What started off as a very nice specs 'point and shoot' digital camera for a grand total: $126.48 (S/H & base price) add the extra$ to make it work for around $150 USD, and I hope it does all it claims to do.  Couldn't find a date-stamp or timer function for self mug-shots/group photos U may want 2 B in, & no tripod over a few inches high in extraneous add-on multi-colored case & add-on deals.  2 ratings to date, and the 3 thumbnails of the camera only show the front, I would love to see the buttons, dials & sliders on the back of that 2.7\" LCD screen.
