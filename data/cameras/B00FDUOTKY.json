The camera solution leaked and Amazon replaced the wet contents. When the 2nd package arrived the bottle soaked all the contents AGAIN!It's obvious the solution needs to be shipped in a container separately. I gave up on ordering a 3rd replacement knowing that the solution was obviously going to leak.Please replace your envelopes for new containers designed to ship liquid and solutions.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "2nd purchase of product", "Author": "mary jo", "ReviewID": "R3N67MPFUA8THG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wait, dont let the title chase you away.
