Received it within 2 days with my Prime account, just set up everything up and turned on for first time. Everything that it states is in the package is, plus the battery/charger which it technically doesnt mention. Everything came well packaged, in great condition. Its easy to set up, even without reading the directions thoroughly. The camera itself looks awesome, definitely a stand out product. This is my first camera, based on suggestions from friends who are in photography, and im positive im going to love it!", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great deal.", "Author": "Gerard J.

The photo's have to be perfect and they are with this camera. The wide angle lens takes a great pic encompassing a lot of the room. The only reason I gave it 4 stars & not 5 is the camera is a little heavy & the lens is a little large when the camera is swinging around my neck. I do love it and the Red is stunning. People always comment on the color.

At first I was afraid because there is so many settings and attachments. I still have a lot to learn but I am still able to take professional pictures with little knowledge of all the settings. I love it!! I have captured so many moments with my child who just turned one and family events. The shutter setting is one of my favorites for my child and the dog. It is easy to hook to the computer and take the pictures off of it and if your willing to learn the camera has options to teach you.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Jossie", "ReviewID": "R3VE8EIP90KIWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's just perfect, it was as expected and as described in the picture.

Also the provided kit lens is a very good deal. However everything else is garbage! Save yourself the money and buy each piece individually.
