But nothing on Amazon.After inspecting the product I noticed many very thin needles on the bag. Some 5 inches in length, but most under a quarter of an inch. The bag was really covered with this stuff. An edge was ripped off a bit producing even more needles.This product is not worth buying at any price. I can't imagine having to use gloves each time to touch my documents. I do not want to be arrested at the airport because someone touching my passport got some strange itching.When I was buying this I thought this is a thick bag made of several layers of different fabrics. One layer for thermal insulation, and at least one for making this bag airtight under high temperature - like melting but burn proof plastic. This bag doesn't have anything like that. The air can flow in and out of this bag. Because of oxygen in high temperature the documents will get charred even before the fire touches the bag.Bad design, bad craftsmanship and bad packaging.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fiberglass Fiber Warning", "Author": "B.

Be informed before you buy!Due to limitations of today's materials, all safe products are susceptible to heat and fire damage when exposed to high temperatures for extended periods of time. Thus, no safe product manufactured today is considered \"fire proof\". Certain materials can provide resistance to high temperatures for limited periods of time. Safes properly constructed with these materials can be classified as \"fire resistant\". Depending upon the materials used and the methods of construction, safes can provide varying degrees of fire resistance.What level of fire resistance do I need?In a home fire, the peak temperature and duration of the fire can vary depending upon the size of the home, the materials used to construct the home, the response time of firefighters, etc. It is estimated that the typical peak temperature in a home fire ranges from 800 to 1200 degrees Fahrenheit. The typical time for firefighting authorities to bring a home fire into containment is estimated at 15 to 30 minutes. Paper chars at approximately 402\u00b0F. To protect paper documents, the internal temperature of a safe must remain below 350\u00b0F while exposed to the conditions of the typical home fire. Thus at a minimum, a safe should provide enough fire resistance to keep the maximum internal temperature of the safe below 350\u00b0F, when exposed to external temperatures of 1200 degrees for 30 minutes.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "I hope it works when needed", "Author": "Guitartec \"DBF\"", "ReviewID": "R311FCG2M76R3C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just bought this bag to keep the paper valuables in my safe, that much safer.

The actual packaging says nothing at all about temperature or the amount of protection you can expect. Even so, for 10 bucks I like the added security.

This is fine for documents, metals, and other durable goods, but many common plastics melt at much lower temperatures:PETE: 230F (plastic bags)LDPE: 248F (food storage containers, optical media)HDPE: 266F (bottles, bottle caps)PVC:  360F (credit cards)PVC beats the mark for its melting point, but bear in mind that all plastics soften and warp at much lower temperatures than they melt. Anyone that's put a food storage container or plastic utensil too near a dishwasher's heating element, or left optical media on their car's dashboard on a sunny day, knows this well.Fiberglass is not flameproof, but it can persistently resist up to 1,200F. The loose weave of this particular product is rated for 1,000F. This makes it feasible to keep valuable plastics in your 350F fire safe (think backup media, mothballed credit cards, spare keys with plastic-covered handles, etc.).I have only one of these bags, and did not see any loose fibers when it came out of the box. Due to the many negative reviews I have treated it carefully. I put my items in the bag without stretching it, and gently folded it over.

However, should this bag truly be 100% fiberglass mesh, it should do an adequate job of fire protection.I replaced my old Nike shoebox with a SentrySafe HD4100. There are other smaller, cheaper fire safes that also carry a specific fire protection rating, such as the SentrySafe 1100 or some of the First Alert models. I bought this bag as an extra level of protection inside the fire safe, and for that, it should be fine.This U.S. Patrol bag has a substantial feel to it, and a flap that closes over the contents, holding them inside. On the downside, there was some discoloration on the bag in a few spots, I believe from the cardboard packaging, but not enough to warrant a return. There is definitely shedding of fiberglass fibers.

I was somewhat wary given some of the negative reviews that some others have left regarding fibers, and poor craftsmanship. Perhaps I got a different batch, however, the two bags I ordered were very well tailored, with no flaking fibres, very thick and strongly stitched. I am VERY pleased by the two bags I ordered and will be ordering a few more in the near future.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "bigbass", "Author": "bigbass", "ReviewID": "R3HMOQSSH8Z08Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good idea and is working as intended.
