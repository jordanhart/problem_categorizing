{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Rachael Jones", "ReviewID": "R2N61AOCSDDHUV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This 1/2 inch slender camera with face detection takes great photos unlike any camera that I've owned. I love it and all of the features it has! I love the face detection that automatically focuses and optimizes for the perfect photo when it's in auto mode. It also automatically adjusts with the lighting and has multiple settings. Some of the manual settings include underwater portrait, sunset, sport, landscape, and night scene. The pictures are sharp thanks to the on-board image stabilization. I tested it out on the highway to see if I could capture vehicles at a high speed and it literally froze the vehicles with not a hint of a blur taking a sharp photo and making the cars seem like like they weren't even moving.  After owning this for a few months I still do not know all of the tweaks and tools because I discover something new with it everytime I use it. The rechargeable battery has a long life and made it through an entire day of use at the park. I am an Olympus fan for life.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "0.7\" Super-Slim, All-Metal Body\nFace Detection\nDigital Image Stabilization\nLi-Ion Rechargeable Battery\nAVI Movie with Sound", "Name": "Olympus FE360 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Dual Zoom (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JYwNUO32L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001DFQN7K"}}
