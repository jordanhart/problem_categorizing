{"Reviews": [{"Title": "WiFI enabled...Marvellous", "Author": "Theoni Lussos \"Kandy\"", "ReviewID": "R25OTL2Z462LI9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for my sister for her birthday because it had Built-in Wi-Fi capability, and you can send photos to Facebook(tm), Picasa(tm), Photobucket(tm) or email directly from the camera. You can also upload videos to YouTube You can also save the images to your PC by just one click with Auto Backup. No searching for the cable, and while it is a  long (10x) zoom camera it is not bulky but fits in her pocket (it's about 19mm thick)...and for traveling, which she will be doing this summer, it has  Live Panorama, that creates 180\u00ba panoramic images. Finally since she isn't the best at manuevering all the dials, this baby has Smart Auto 2.0. that has scene detection technology identifying up to 16 different shooting conditions, instantly analyzing  key elements of the composition, and then  adjusting to optimize settings for every individual situation.  Other things are Magic Frame which has 12 background templates such as Wall Art, Full Moon, Magazine and Holiday that let you easily create poster-quality art and Artistic Brush which is like your own in camera pixlr that  takes any portrait, landscape or candid and turn it into a black and white sketch and Split Shot where  you can merge up to three different images to create an artistic statement!I personally liked the Optical Image Stabilization(OIS) that helps you get still shots whether you are or not (moving cars, shaky hands, ferris wheels) .  It comes in black, silver and hot pink....she loves it and I liked the fab price.  Highly recommended.", "Date": "March 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simple and good...", "Author": "Northspirit", "ReviewID": "R2XP3DIM4ARL4X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this little camera.  Great pictures and the video is surprisingly good with 720p.  The menus only require a minimal learning curve.  The wi-fi is a great feature and transfers to my computer, tablet, and social sites are smooth and fast.  The price makes it a good value.", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing pictures and video for the price", "Author": "akshatp", "ReviewID": "R1YILQJUKVCEUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Originally saw this at Target on clearance for $150, but they didnt have any in stock.  Turns out it was even less on Amazon.  I was skeptical at first, but figured Ill give it a shot for my mother in law who had lost her camera on vacation.I can honestly say I am blown away by the quality of the pictures this thing produces.  Even in semi-low light conditions very little noise, great focus.  The 720p video on a bright day outside rivals that of my Canon Vixia camcorder.  Even video taken inside with the lights on is more than adequate as long as you dont plan on selling your footage to hollywood.Its easy enough to use for the technically challenged, and offers some more advanced features (wifi transfer, email, social networking stuff) if you are inclined to use it for that.For under $120, you cannot go wrong with this.", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE THIS CAMERA!!!!", "Author": "Christine Chacon Brandlin", "ReviewID": "R32P7QIDO6XSIK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS IS ONEOF THE EASIEST CAMERAS TO USE.
