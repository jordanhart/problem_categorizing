I have been informed that the site has corrected this now.GE lists a GPS option on their site for this model. There should be a Rakon GPS radio chip inside that uses Geotate software. It may have the chip, but no info is in the manual - nothing! I emailed Geotate and have received no response.The camera is larger than the listed dimensions.", "Date": "October 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Littel price but satisfied overall", "Author": "A. Smith", "ReviewID": "R1FNBE7T1AZLTR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I currently own a Canon 450D DSLR and thought I wouldn't need a point and shoot. That is until my wife didn't want to carry the big DSLR. However, I do kind of miss my last point and shoot camera, but it had a few similarities like the display size and my new GE camera has some upgrades that makes it a little easier on the switch. This camera is great because it's all display screen and mostly no buttons which I like. If you don't want to mess with settings it's as simple as point, shoot and be amazed. I'm really impressed with the build quality of the E1050 TW especially with a metal casing which helps if it's accidentally dropped. I knew that's built by Stainless Steel which I can NOT find in the market. It's a 10MP beauty! I spent $223 on this camera and I think it was worth it. Well done GE!", "Date": "December 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Cool Camera!!", "Author": "C.

The pictures are very good quality.  This really isn't designed for the expert.  SLR type cameras would fit that better.  It is compact, fast, and easy.  It easily fits in a purse and is readily available to quickly capture those moments where you say \"I wish I had a camera\".", "Date": "December 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Choice!", "Author": "M. Ejbeh", "ReviewID": "R2RX7LF5Q7R2Z1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It took me a week in comparing and searching digital cameras. I was searching for the best camera below 150$, my final choice was between the GE E1050TW 140$ from amazon and Pentax  optio a40 130$, the only advantage of the optio is the 12 mp, the advantages of the GE you can't find in more expensive cameras like the  touch screen the panorama picture which is a great option and very useful also the x5 zooming and the HD video. Shooting HD video is limited to 30 minutes per shot whatever the size of the sd card but i think it is fair enough for a continuous shooting and you can get another 30 minutes.", "Date": "February 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Brittany A.

I find this camera really perfect,especially the picture quality (crisps and clear). The videos are clear too! but make sure you should buy a higher memory card, so you could take a long video. I also noticed the battery lasts for 4-5 hours which is cool. Another feature I like(voice recorder) you can record your voice on the pictures sweet!! I love the touchscreen seems like It's fun to touch. A lot of features that you would love about this camera.

(I was replacing a Finepix v10 which took amazing images)  I then bought the Nikon L18, only to be disappointed when it broke in its third week of use.  My girlfriend has a Canon, which has excellent features, but poor contrast/sharpness.  I decided to give GE a try, figuring that there has to be something better/different out there.  It takes amazing pictures, with excellent color and contrast.  The video function has a habit of putting vertical lines down the images when there is any direct sunlight, but other than that, the camera takes amazing images.  The zoom is great, and the touch screen is very intuitive and easy to use.  I recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a mid-sized point and shoot with a slightly larger zoom, and values crisp pictures.", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera!", "Author": "T.

They are more about industrial and medical stuff (our local coal-fire power plant uses 3 GE generators). That is where they excel. But, I know and trust GE as a company since they have been around for well over 100 years. I decided this camera looked like a great deal and was worth a try.The camera its self was very fun to use. It had a solid build (plastic outer casing) and the touch-screen was very easy and fun to use.. It felt like a very high-end camera.The picture quality did fall short of my expectations though. On full auto mode, the pictures showed plenty of grain or noise in darker areas. I played with the ISO settings and didn't notice much difference. The lighter areas showed that the image stabilization didn't work quite as well as others. The colors were typically too warm as well.The auto focus worked about average.The camera performed well with HD videos. Although like pictures, the colors were too warm.I liked that the camera was very fun to use and it looked very nice too. However I was somewhat disappointed in the picture quality. I must tell you though, that the only modern camera I have to compare it to is a $320 Cannon which is highly regarded.. so my review may be a little tougher than others.I purchased through Amazon for $179.99, which I feel is a good price for a high-feature camera. There are probably better cameras out there for the same money, but I feel it is a fair deal if you care more about ease of use as well as features than straight-out picture quality.And ending on that note, I am unable to say whether or not I would recommend it.
