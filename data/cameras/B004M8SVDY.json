The first one I ordered stopped charging correctly after the first day, but I was able to send it back for a replacement, and my new one has been working great. Sure, the night pictures aren't the best, but you're not going to find much better in a camera in this price range.The camera turns on very fast which I like, however if you're using flash sometimes you have to wait a bit before you can take the next picture. I also had some trouble with blurry pictures at first, but I discovered the non-hand shake mode and once it was turned on my camera took great pictures.I really like the simplicity of the buttons, especially the video record button. While it takes a couple seconds to actually start recording, it's fun to just be able to hit the record button to start a video. Some people had problems with the touch screen, but I think it works great. My phone is also a touch screen so I may just be used to how to use them, but I think it is very responsive.  Plus, I think the plum color of the actual camera looks really good.While the camera does have a few time-to-shoot issues (which is why I give it a 4 and not a 5), all in all, I think it's a great, fun camera for this price range.", "Date": "May 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful pics and great price!!", "Author": "Ayleen Allmand", "ReviewID": "R2AOMLOR78KTNL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my new camera!

I am glad I did as compared to the old HP camera, which I loved, this camera is far superior when it comes to ease-of-use. What I most love about this camera is the rechargeable power supply which means I do not have to purchase batteries. As the old HP digital camera was a battery hog, the Nikon is a winner when it comes to this feature.I also like how easy it is to select the functions you would like to use when readying to take a photo. The back of the camera has a touch screen that displays the functions you can choose from. I have older fingers so I do use the attached stylus to choose the function I want to use.When setting up the photo a grid is displayed to help guide you in selecting the correct perspective meaning those photos will come out looking professional.My only complaint is sometimes, for whatever reason, some of the photos tend to come out a bit fuzzy.

It clearly states this in the instruction manual. It is very easy to use and is compact which is nice because as a mother of two small children ease of use is very important. The flash does take a few seconds to recharge and when the battery is getting low the pictures start to get blurry. I have purchased two extra battery packs just to have on hand. They are very inexpensive on ebay and amazon. Another issue I read about was the touch screen. The camera comes with a stylus that can be attached to the strap and I haven't had any problems with it.

Occassionally, they are even better than the Rebel photos.  The touch screen is a great feature, and I like being able to scroll with the screen.  The memory card holds A TON of pictures.  I can go months without deleting.  The size is super convenient and fits in my pocket.  A few issues:  1 - You have to use your fingernail to scroll when using the touchscreen, it doesn't like finger tips.  Not sure that it would be of much use to someone with very short nails. 2 - I have not been able to figure out how to format the memory card from the camera.  I load all the photos to my computer, then delete the camera pics while I'm in the folder (on the comp).  3 - You have to charge using your computer or a USB port to wall converter.

In a nutshell, I don't recommend it for the following reasons:1. Despite a large, easy to use shutter release button on the top of the camera, an inadvertent touch of the touch-screen takes an unintentional photo. Why, Nikon, why?(Found out that through a menu command this \"feature\" can be disabled. It is not very straighforward - one must choose the function for the touchscreen to do something different, \"Touch AE/AF\" or \"Subject Tracking\".)2. When at the max optical zoom, the shutter release nearly always causes camera movement resulting in blurred photo. (This was also corrected by enabling the electronic vibration reduction - which defaults to off.)3. The touchscreen is not responsive at times. Pushing repeatedly at the on-screen menus sometimes only takes a picture rather than bringing up the menu. (No fix for this that I have found. Very frustrating trying to open and navigate menus.)4. I have not used a lot of video, but I have read and experienced that keeping a moving subject in focus is almost impossible. Do not purchase this camera if your primary use will be videotaping action.Other than those quirks, the quality of the photos (clarity, color, exposure) can be outstanding if you know what you're doing.

Nikon has about the worst customer service I have experienced when it comes to repairs.

Easy usability, some great features for an inexpensive camera. But, just use it for a couple weeks and you'll have problems. Zoom button quits working, lens cover won't open without assist of my fingers prying it open (therefore creating smudges on the lens), blurry spots on the screen, etc.So, camera sent in, was \"fixed\" and sent back to me. Zoom button works slightly, but not sensitive enough to even take a zoomed picture within any reasonable length of time it takes to get the zoom toggle to actually move. The lens cover still was sticking, although not as consistently as before. Ultimately sent the camera in again, with the exact same problems as it was having within weeks out of the box. Now, they say it is my fault, that the camera has water damage. HELLO! The lens cover was not closing! No kidding there's water damage.

This camera was inexpensive and I thought it took good pictures for the price, so I decided to try again and buy the newer model of the camera that I had. I bought this camera last November and have only used it a few times since then. I never dropped it, or got it wet (I always stored it in a case.)This weekend I went on a trip so obviously, I was using the camera a lot. After taking maybe 150 or more pictures, I turned the camera on and all a sudden the screen said lens error. I turned it off then back on again and the screen was all blurry and it wouldn't turn off right away when I pressed the on/off button - The screen was green too. I turned it back on again and the lens comes out, but then 2 seconds later the camera shuts off by itself! after I used the camera I'd turn it off so I wouldn't waste battery power, and would turn it on again when I wanted to take a picture. I don't see why turning it off and on would ruin the lens, but if so, what a peice of crap this camera is. I don't understand why all a sudden I got a lens error.

I should've listened to all the reviews here that warned about this problem.  The camera was a great deal-fabulous price for the options-so I didn't listen.  Because of that, I was left with a dead camera for the last month of summer vacation.  I feel sick at having spent the money and now have nothing.Update and downgrade to my rating:  I followed the online directions for returning the dead camera with battery, to the letter.  Filled out online form, wrapped up the camera SEPARATELY from the tiny battery (how dumb is it that they tell you to take the tiny battery OUT of the camera for shipment?) and paid to send it to them.  They sent a friendly status update that my camera was still under warranty so no cost to \"fix\" it but......then sent back my camera with an invoice stating that my camera was fine.  They said there was no battery included, which was WRONG.  They must've thrown it away when they unpacked it because it sure as heck WAS included. So now I'm out an additional $10 and I still have a dead camera that only worked for four months.  *B* *S*Ongoing drama....so I called customer service to complain that, even though I sent paperwork stating that I was including the camera and battery, and included the camera and battery...they returned the camera stating they did not receive a battery.  Customer service said they'd talk to service dept and get back to me.  <crickets> <crickets> Seven days later and no word, so I called back.  The new CS girl said that the service dept never emailed the first CS back, which is why the first CS didn't get back in touch with me.  New CS girl said she'd re-email service dept and see if they'll respond this time.  Er.....is this the best they can do?  Really?

Most of my point and shoot cameras were from Canon. The picture quality on these ran from very good to excellent. Even the least expensive ones took good quality pictures.This camera takes fuzzy pictures. The auto focus is very slow and inaccurate, especially close up (I don't mean \"macro\" close ... I mean a few feet). The only thing it shoots with any degree of sharpness are landscapes, but even an old Brownie camera with no focus mechanism could do that. I'm glad I didn't pay much for it. In my opinion this barely qualifies as a camera. My telephone takes pictures that are as sharp or sharper than this camera. The reason I don't use my telephone to take pictures is I don't like taking pictures on a non-camera.I have tested this camera now in a range of conditions, with and without flash.It isn't bad with flash, but recycling time is very slow. You have to wait 5 to 10 seconds between shots on a full battery. If you are trying to catch \"action\" at, say, a kid's party, use a better camera. This won't do the job.It does NOT come with a separate battery charger. You have to charge the battery IN the camera or buy an after-market external charger. I bought an external one for about $5 and a couple of spare batteries for $4.58. Don't pay more. It isn't worth it.What's good about it? It's small, light and cute. Also, I got it cheap. Its list price is $179 and I hope nobody really pays that. There's a new version (S4300)out, but the specs are essentially the same, so don't expect it to be better.If you are looking for a small, light camera to take with you when you don't want to bring your bigger, much more expensive gear, this is not the camera for you. Get any one of the Canon point and shoots. Even the worst one beats this by a country mile.If you are s snap shooter who can't tell if the picture is fuzzy or not and really doesn't care anyhow, and if you get the camera as a gift, it might be better than nothing.

Resolution was nice and it was cool to use touchscreen.  However, one of the first problems (at least when I first received) was the fact when it tried playing back 720p videos it recorded, it either got choppy or nearly froze.  Only way to play such videos back was on a computer or another camera (if supported).A few months to maybe a year later, it too suffered the lens error.  Fortunately, I was able to correct it (and the S3000 model I thought got lens damage).  Later on in its lifespan, it was also beginning to suffer a charging problem (others have mentioned).  Turns out it wasn't the charging at all that had issues, but rather it eats batteries very rapidly (even when off!). Got new batteries that were supposed to last longer (more amps available), but got drained as well.In the S3000 model, however, I have kept batteries (no charging) in there for months and still carry a charge.  Of course, they drain batteries when not in use, but usually slowly.  Not so with the S4100.Another problem I noticed was the fact it was beginning to have delays in picture taking.  When I just recently used my S3000 I got back in June 2010, it was still very efficient at taking pictures.  Never had to replace the battery for it either.  When I had the lens error originally on the S3000 model, I dropped it on concrete though with no screen damage. Unfortunately, my S4100's screen was destroyed/damaged just recently due to mere bumping.

I'm a semi-pro photographer and I own 3 other cameras ( 1 canon p&s; included) along with this camera. When I first got this camera I was trilled by the 14MP and the touch screen capabilities. It was my first Nikon as well since I AM A CANON FAN HEAD.During my first few photos I tested all the features and different effects etc. until I began noticing that when zoomed in the photos were fussy and unpleasant to look at. It was nasty when it came to providing sharp edges and mostly required the flash to assist in keeping images sharp - not razor sharp, but sharp. The flash was another headache it was ridiculous, causing red eyes everywhere. But depending on the scene it would light very nicely. The HD 720p video capabilities is nothing to shout about, as that too was a unsuccessful function on Nikon's part. I would take videos and when I upload them on the PC to edit them they would lag and sometimes be distorted. Zooming in was a waste of time as the images would be horrifying. The touch screen was slow to react which was a major turn off. Playback lags and having to slide through pictures sometimes you miss the photo you really want to get to. The battery I find, last pretty long FOR ME; as I don't use it(the camera) on a major scale. With that is said I'm looking to sell this Nikon and buy a Canon bridge camera. The ONE TIME I decided to give Nikon a chance I was fooled!In comparison to the Canon P&S; I mentioned earlier, this Nikon is only 4 more mega-pixels stronger than my canon and the HD Video and touch screen are the only functions my dear Canon p&s; doesn't have other than that my 3 yr old canon p&s; still beats out this Nikon!I would not recommend this product to anyone.

I wanted it as a back up for my Cannon camera. I was not looking for anything very special. I wanted very basic photo and video capability. This appeared to do that.When I got it out of the box and tried it for the first time the touch screen was difficult to navigate, but I did get used to it. Figuring out the symbols for the settings was not intuative and the user guide with the camera is useless. After some trouble-shooting, I was able to figure out how to get the settings to work as I like them to work. The picture quality lacked though and their automatic settings were green or yellow and I could not figure out how to get a better light balance on this camera.Then, I took this camera on vacation. I attempted to fully charge the battery before leaving. It did not fully charge. I took the charging cord that came with the camera with to charge while on vacation. It still did not charge. After trying to charge it multiple times now unsuccessfully, the battery is completely exhausted and will not work. I am reluctant to buy another rechargable battery for this camera because from what I am now reading about this camera, the problem will not be fixed.I am currently trying to work with Nikon to resolve this issue, but I do not anticipate I will have a functioning camera at the end of this frustration.So, if you have $100 to throw away on a product, this one will gladly take it. I will not be buying another Nikon in my lifetime.

The camera takes solif images for a point and shoot camera, comes with everything you need, and looks relatively nice. One of the greatest features of the camera is that it uses optical zoom most as opposed to digital zoom. This allows you to take closer photos without sacrificing the quality of the image.The main thing that makes me despise this camera though is the resistive touch screen they used on the back LCD. For those who aren't aware there are two types of touch screens that are commonly used resistive, and capacitive. A capacitive touch screen can sense electrical impulses that are released by your body when it comes in contact with anything. These are the touch screens most of us know and love as they are present on our smart phones, ipads, tablets, and other devices. Resistive on the other hand works as it sounds like it would, by requiring pressure to actually be exerted on the screen to react to the touch. This system has become a lot less popular as the screens that require pressure also tend to break a lot more quickly because of all the pushing. I would easily overlook all of that outdated technology save for one huge flaw in it's use... the pressure needed to activate any of the buttons is way more than I feel comfortable using and often doesn't work properly.That said the camera does come with a mini stylus tool to assist in pressing the screen more easily but the idea that someone must have a stylus to press the buttons seems too inconvenient for my liking.", "Date": "May 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Flashy but mediocre", "Author": "DMW", "ReviewID": "R4FFJAZUF0A2K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The plum color is cute, the touch screen is exciting but not really an improvement over buttons for navigating menus more easily . . . Quality of photos is not great; other cameras I have used (slightly more expensive) have much better vibration reduction for low-light. My biggest complaint, however, is the amount of time it takes between turning the camera on and being able to take a picture - you have to press the button twice, which means that awesome thing you wanted to catch may be lost forever.

It has a bit of a delay on it from oushing the button to it actually taking the picture.  The flash is a double flash and snaps the picture on the second flash.  This is a problem since I am takin gpics of kids and after the first flash they think I have taken the pic and are ready to move on.  So I have a lot of moving pictures, which, may I add were blurry ( and the flash was on).  Your subject has to stay VERY still for the pic to turn out and be somewhat clear.

IT IS OVEPRICED TRASH.Sadly, I DID NOT look into the reviews for this camera before I purchased. I even bought it at Best Buy and spent almost 200 on the garbage. I have had this camera for 3 months. I first ran into the problem of it not charging about 1.5 months in. I simply replaced it with the backup battery that I bought with the camera bundle. I then began having troubles actually taking a picture, the response time was getting longer and longer, (and when you are trying to take pics of a one year old running around it gets very frustrating). Finally, a week ago I took it out to get a few pics and the only button that worked was the power button.... I tried to turn it off, it would not, I had to take the battery out. As the camera turned off the lens would not retract, it just kept clicking. This camera is trash in my oppinion, I have sent it in to be repaired but they tell me it is going to be atleast 3 weeks.

I paid $179 for this camera at my local Walmart Supercenter. Granted I wish Walmart would take digital camera returns at 6 months instead of 30 days, but you can't blame Walmart for that. I surely can blame Nikon though!The camera worked good, but not great. It does bad when you have good lighting and kids are moving. I have a Nikon D3000 SLR camera, which I love, but it is way too bulky when you want a simple point & shoot camera. Secondly, the touch screen is aweful! It delays all the time and you can only use your fingernails to scroll through the photos. I have 2 kids with 1 on the way and I don't keep my fingernails long b/c I don't want to scratch the kids.After using the camera a few months, I just got used to it and I wish I would have taken it back, but since I had a Nikon SLR camera that works great, I figured another Nikon wouldn't be bad. WRONG!!! After 4 months of use, but not extensive use, the lens broke. It is currently being fixed by Nikon and it is covered under warranty. But contacting Nikon is no better and here is why.I sent the camera in on July 6, 2011 and it got to their service center on July 8, 2011. I had to pay $6 for a different box to ship it in and another $8 just to ship it to them. Then I called them on July 15 and was told the camera had been in the shop for repairs. I called Nikon again on July 18 and was told that the camera just got into the shop and will take 7-10 business days to fix. I complained to them and they said they had several cameras in for service. How can you stand by your product if customers are constantly sending their cameras in for repairs? Considering my camera broke because of a malfunction, I would expect better treatment by the customer service department and definitely should have received the fixed camera by now. It has been 8 days since they received the camera and I probably won't receive it until next week or the week after, which I will be probably delivering my baby by then.Do yourself a favor and buy a Canon instead. I cannot find my purchase receipt for my Nikon D3000 camera and now am scared to use it because if something breaks, I don't know if Nikon will fix it.
