{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera, horrible bundle. Buy from another", "Author": "Joe_vberg \"joevberg\"", "ReviewID": "RNSWM03RETO5J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I researched quite a bit before deciding to get the rx100m2. It was hard to find new ones at a discounted price so I was happy to find this bundle (paid $686).  That is until it arrived.1.  I can tell that this camera was slightly used, definitely was taken out of the box and then put back in.  Should be listed as an open box.  The box itself looked faded.  The camera so far appears to have no issues.2.  The bundled accessories are very very cheap.  I am hoping the travel charger and spare batteries make it worth it.  However the 64gb SDcard DOES NOT WORK!!!  I verified other SDcards do so I know it is not the camera.I have emailed DavisMAX about some kind of resolution to this before I go through the dreaded hassle of returning it all.  I have yet to hear back.So, this is not really a review of the camera, there are more experienced people out there that have given great reviews.  This is a review, or warning, about buying this bundle and from DavisMAX.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$736.79", "Features": "Sony DSC-RX100M II Cyber-shot Digital Still Camera 20.2MP\nMulti Card USB Reader + Memory Card Wallet\nTwo LP-BX1 Rechargeable Lithium Ion Replacement Battery\nDeluxe Starter Kit\nSee Description for MORE!", "Name": "Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 II Digital Camera + Two NP-BX1 Replacement Lithium Ion Battery + External Rapid Charger + 64GB SDHC Class 10 Memory Card + Mini HDMI Cable + Carrying Case + Multi Card USB Reader + Memory Card Wallet + Deluxe Starter Kit DavisMAX Bundle", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51b6pA8QvgL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00H8BWYVM"}}
