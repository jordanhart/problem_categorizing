This should dramatically improve the general focus operation of the camera, while at the same time, the new sytem allows the user more control than the older *ist DL. [Cross type autofocus means that at that particular point, the camera can focus on both horizontal and vertical lines. Many cameras, like the Canon Rebel XT, only have one cross sensors. This K100D has 9.]The stabalizer is the real gem here. The stabalizer will be a big benefit to anyone who does a high percentage of the shots indoors, WITH or without flash. For candid, non-flash photos, the stabalizer allows you to shoot at slower shutter speeds. That's also great for things like museums, that don't allow flash photos.What people sometimes miss is how the stabalizer helps with flash. The flash fires fast, up to 1/10,000th of a second. But it only lights up our subject. If no other light get through, then we have cardboard cut-out subjects standing in front of a black background. At normal flash shutter speeds, we often have a background, but much is too dark. The stabalizer allows you to shoot at a slower speed without shaking the camera. This brings out more background. Additionally, more available light strikes the subject, requiring a bit less light from the flash. This makes the subject appear more \"real\", our goal with flash photos.The camera construction is solid, and a bit heavier than you might think because of its metal interior. For good or bad, the camera uses 4 AA batteries. Their easy to get, NiMH rechargables are cheap, but they weigh a bit more and don't last as long as the Lithium Ion type batteries.Pentax has a good selection of lenses, but not up there with the likes of Canon and Nikon.The K100D stacks up very nicely due to the built-in stabalizer, multi-zone AF, construction, and large LCD. If you have a bit more money to spend, consider the Sony A100, which upgrades to 10 megapixel and Lithium Ion battery.Pentax has released firmware update 1.01, which now allows the camera to use the new SDHC cards which should be available soon.

At 18mm, I found that I could usually get a decent picture of a building or room.  It worked great for scenery too.Since I didn't want to spend most of our trip adjusting my camera for each photograph, I usually just used Aperture Priority mode and auto focus.

I'm not sorry I did. While Pentax doesn't have the market share of Canon or Nikon, this is probably the best bang for your buck as far as entry level DSLR's go. Here are some pros and cons of this camera:PROS:*Excellent size--not too big, not too small. Fantastic grip and shutter-button placement.*Very solid build. Feels much better in your hand than the Rebel XT/XTi.*In-body IS. This, to me, is the trump card for this camera. It works, and instantly any lens you have is stabilized. Even if some people argue a lens-based IS regime is better, what good is it when you can't afford the expensive IS lenses anyway? Fact is, in-body IS works--shots taken even at 1/8 to 1/10 have a much higher hit-rate with than without it.*Can use any Pentax lens ever made. If you're like me and are on a budget, scouring eBay for deals can be fun and educational.*Solid kit lens. Comes with the standard 18-55 but has a metal mount and is quite good, apparently, as far as kit lenses are concerned.*Prime lenses. I can't believe how much of a difference a fast prime lens can make, and Pentax is probably the leader with these. With an f/1.7 or so lens, you just can' believe the kind of shutter speeds you can get even in low light. 1/10 on a normal lens can easily transform into 1/50 with a fast prime. It makes a huge difference.*AA batteries. When I was in Europe with my P&S; and I fried my AA NiMH charger, the fact my camera took AA's saved my butt. You can get them anywhere in a pinch, and a small investment in some good NiMH's get excellent results with this camera.*Comes bundled with RAW software. I'm not a huge RAW shooter, but it's nice to know it's there if I want/need it. Some cameras come with RAW capibility but no software to harness it. Not this one.CONS:*Weak buffer/continuous shooting mode. You only get about 4-5 continuous JPG shots. If you're like me and don't shoot sports or action much, it's not so much of a big deal. If you do, you might want to look elsewhere.*WB a little spotty. AWB is worthless in low light, but the tungsten preset is good. But it stinks that when you pop the flash it doesn't revert to flash WB, so you have to do it manually every time. It's the little things like this where Nikon and Canon probably beat Pentax.*Slow read/write time. It just isn't very speedy, even with a fast card.*Exposure compensation deactivates Auto-ISO. Basically, you can select your ISO range (e.g., 200-800). But if you use +/- compensation, it turns that feature off, reverting you to 200 and forcing you to change. A little annoying.Overall, this is a great camera. There are a few annoyances and its overall operation isn't the fastest. But the images are excellent, and the in-body IS and prime lenses are a treat. Highly recommended.", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "First Impressions", "Author": "Gary P. Olson", "ReviewID": "R2G8LHC1SFZW4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Other reviewers have covered some of the technical details of the K100D, but I would like to focus on the ease-of-use perspectives.  I have owned a Pentax ZX-5n film SLR for a number of years so I have been waiting for the right time to add a digital body.It was logical for me to stick with Pentax, but it really gets back to the reason I went with Pentax in the first place.  Compared to the other major manufacturers, I think Pentx does a much better job designing a camera that does NOT require you to carry a camera manual with you at all times.  One of the problems with modern technology is that it offers almost endless choices which can intimidate and bewilder the average user.  The imbedded functions on some of the modern digital SLRs are often only accessible through a complex set of menus or user-defined codes.I trusted Pentax would not design a camera that way, and the K100D is quite usable right out of the box.  The default settings are quite robust, and this camera can be used readily as a high-quality point-and-shoot.  Most SLR users want more than that from a camera: aperature and shutter priority, ISO settings and a few other things.  On the K100D, moving from auto to manual adjustment is straightforward and simple.Pentax optics are excellent and the picture quality from the K100D is perfect for anyone short of a professional photographer.  Overall, this camera has delivered everything I expected and more.", "Date": "August 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Exellent for the price", "Author": "Ladyhawker", "ReviewID": "R38FIM61NCJI29", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was on a very tight budget and needed a new camera ASAP, since my old fixed lens camera had a lens that became \"unfixed\".  I had a 35mm Pentax SLR years ago and loved it.  After looking around, specifically at the Nikon D40 and the Canon Rebel, I decided to go with another Pentax this time due to it's affordablity and the online reviews that I had read.  I have been very pleased, but there are limitations to this camera.First things I like:I really love the Shake Reduction feature.  Neither Nikon or Canon had this.  I was skeptical that it would make much of difference, but I have found that it does help the blur when you are pushing the shutter speed to a setting a little slower than you could normally get away with without a tripod.  The Shake Reduction does add weight to the camera, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I like the extra weight, I think it feels more substantial in my hand and when mounted on a tripod, it feels more steady.I also like that it takes AA batteries.  It is nice to be able to stop into any gas station and pick up new batteries if I get into a bind, plus rechargable AAs are cheap and widely available for purchase.  Other things that I like, the menus in the camera are easy to maneuver once you get oriented and the screen on the back is nice and big.I REALLY love that the camera can be turned on instantly and there is no delay when a take a photo.  On my fixed lens camera, it took a couple seconds to power up and due to a delay between when I pushed the shutter and when the camera actually would get around to capturing the image, I had to try and anticipate how early to push the shutter button to get the photo I was going for.  This was a source of endless frustration when photographing objects in motion, especially my children.  However, I realize that this is a benefit of pretty much any DSLR and is not an advantage that is unique to the Pentax K100D.Another nice feature is the 2 second delay.  I've never had a camera with this setting before.  When using this, the mirror drops out of the way as soon as you push the shutter button, but it doesn't actually take the photo until 2 seconds later.  This lets any vibrations inside the camera due to moving parts settle down before the photo is actually taken.  This has come in handy when taking shots that are especially vibration sensitive, for example photos we take through our telescope.It can be as easy or as complicated to use as you want it to be.  I have fun playing with all the the manual settings, but in the automatic modes, it is easy enough that my 9 and 10 year old kids can use it too. Admittedly, I had to give them a quick training session so they could understand how the autofocus works, but they got the hang of it really fast with minimal practice.  The \"Kids\" setting is where I leave it when I turn it off, making it ready and waiting for the quick grab and click photos of my kids doing their everyday stuff.Things I don't like:I wish it had an ISO setting below 200.  A lower setting would help reduce noise when making bigger enlargements.I don't usually like the color I get from the auto white balance mode, particularly when I am shooting inside.  I have noticed this problem to be worse when I am in a large auditorium under those big square industrial lights that give a yellowish hue.  This color problem can be fixed by using the manual white balance, an easy procedure, but sometimes I forget to do this until it's too late.  This is a little quirk that I am still getting used to.  This is my first DSLR, and I am a very amateur photographer in training, so maybe this is to be expected with any camera -- I really have no idea.A few words on megapixels:6.1 is fairly low on the scale of available megapixels on new cameras today, but after doing some reading on the subject, I couldn't see spending a lot of money chasing megapixels.  6.1 is big enough for me to do a 16 x 20 enlargement, the largest size I have ever needed, and that is only needed on rare occasions.  It is also big enough to let me do a fairly tight crop and print a nice 5x7 or 8x10 if I feel the need.Summary:OK, so yes there are better cameras out there, but you can spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on photographic equipment and still recognize that there is something better out there than what you have.  I gave this camera 5 stars because for the price, I just don't think it gets any better than this.  I love it.", "Date": "July 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Nice feel and features", "Author": "K. Gittins", "ReviewID": "R2FR56KRKIOLPG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I like my Canon A620 (replacing an A95) it is a bit limited on focal length, and even Canon's conversion lenses degrade the image and make the zoom into a fixed focal length lens. So, after much deliberation, I began shopping for a DSLR.The Olympus E-500 with 2 lenses and dust-cleaning is a low-priced option, but the 2X multiplier on the focal length makes really wide angle lenses a bit rare. And, ergonomically it was not quite right for my hands.The Canon Digital Rebel XTi (my original first choice) and the Nikon D80 are very nice, with more resolution, but they are too pricey for me. The Nikon D50 is about the same price as the K100D, but has no shake reduction in the body, though that is available in some more-expensive lenses. The Nikons were a bit large for my hands as well.So, I went with the K100D. Its medium size feels solid, the buttons and general layout are good, and it has all the basic features most people will need.The viewfinder is nice and bright, but very shiney and a bit reflective in bright light. However, the camera displays the basic settings on the top panel, so you may not need to use the LCD much unless you review all your pictures or make frequent menu/setup changes. I use a stick-on flip-up LCD protector that slides off if desired, leaving a glass cover over the screen.As with all manufacturers, the kit lens is OK but not great for one reason or another, so I got the body only. Pentax makes a decent selection of basic lenses, and Sigma or Tamron, among others, should fill any other needs. I opted for the Pentax 10-17 fisheye (reasonably priced with [...]), a Sigma 18-50 2.8 EX (kind of pricey but supposedly a great lens) for the mid-range stuff, and a Sigma 70-300 APO DG 4.5/5.6 (also reasonably priced) for the long end.Pentax include 2 software packages. First is \"Photo Browser 3\", which handles directories and thumbnails, slideshows, basic image manipulation such as crop and rotate, and a variety of printing options. You can print photos only, Exif info only, or combinations in various sizes. You can also save an \"index print\" of thumbnails as a jpg, which makes a handy contact sheet. Just about every manufacturer includes something similar. However, Pentax also includes \"Photo Laboratory 3\" which is used to process RAW image data that the camera can produce instead of a jpg. With it you can change individual parameters of the unprocessed image data, such as color balance, contrast, or even lens distortion, without degrading the image quality, then save as a jpg or tiff.I've only had the camera a little while, but I'm confident I made good choices. I've posted some photos in the Amazon collection.", "Date": "November 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera.....FIVE STARS!", "Author": "Tyrone Beckman", "ReviewID": "R14IP95DDJ3VZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera and I am very pleased with it. Pentax quality speaks for itself and IMHO Nikon and Canon do not have significantly better quality lenses to justify the much higher price. (I have owned Nikon equipment and used Canon, so I am not speaking out of ignorance.) The 6.1 MP cameras from each company actually use the same SONY CCD, so the only difference in the body is the software and feature set. Again they are not worth the extra money.Now to answer the question on everyones mind, YES the shake reduction really does work. It works VERY well in fact. I can verify that, for me anyway, it adds a 3.5 stop advantage. I have been able to shoot at 300MM in fairly low light with no blur HANDHELD!!!! This is something I would never do without a tripod before, but now I can take shots when I don't have my tripod that I would otherwise have to pass up. Don't get me wrong on this point though, because it won't make up for poor technique or make the impossible happen, but it will give you an added advantage that can make the difference between getting a shot or missing one.Also the ease of use is a great bonus, especially for the beginner or if you are experienced and just working under fast moving conditions where you don't have the time to think out every detail. This camera is equally impressive whether in full auto or full manual mode. If you are a Pentax owner, this camera is worth looking at to upgrade to. If you are new to DSLR's, this camera is worth your time and money as a first camera....the next real stop up is $2000 away.My advice is get this camera! It is worth it!", "Date": "September 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "The Little Pentax that (almost) Could", "Author": "John Buckingham \"Smokey Raku-Potts\"", "ReviewID": "R3S1WJIRPA53QK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm fortunate enough to work in a college A-V department, which means that I have access to some top-notch toys. We've been partial to Canon dSLRs; for the past four years I've used a 10D and a 20D. Image quality, solid build and features from those two legendary cameras put them far ahead of most competitors.Why, then, did I turn to the Pentax K100D when I decided to buy my own dSLR earlier this year? Despite the nearly second to none image quality from Canon, I truly detest the cheap, tacky plastic feel of the Rebel line, with the Rebels' painfully shallow grip making extended use uncomfortable for my long-fingered right mitt. Rebel pricing continues to be hundreds of dollars higher than other entry level dSLRs; I didn't have a spare grand to spend on a full Rebel system, despite already owning a few EOS compatible lenses from my retired 35mm EOS SLR. After doing a lot of online research - winnowing out Nikons, the Sony Alpha (am I the only one who found the build to be appallingly cheesy?), various Olympuses - only Pentax models remained. Nostalgically recalling my beloved Pentax ME Super 35mm SLR from 25 years ago, I figured I'd give the K100D a go. The reviews were solid; sample images looked quie good; the feature set - including RAW and built-in image stabilizing - quite impressive for such a remarkable price. (The K10D, while 4MP higher in resolution, didn't justify its $500 price difference based on the test images I viewed online.) I ordered the body only and paired the K100D with a Tokina 24-200 autofocus lens (which turned out to be heavier than the K100D itself but provides extra range at the wide angle end, due to the cameras 1.5 magnification factor)The first extended test of my K100D came on vacation to southern CA in March this year. Over the course of nearly two weeks, the camera and lens performed very well. I enjoyed the rugged feel of the K100D - the deep grip allowed me to shoot without finger cramp - and the large LCD made reviewing my images a breeze. What wasn't to like?Namely, no 100 ISO setting; slow focusing (perhaps the Tokina lens should take the blame, but I'm not so certain); a pinging then clacky shutter which sounds cheap; unimpressive RAW images; often jaggy JPEGs at 100% viewing;  the low light performance which means very noisy photos at 800 and 1600 IS0s - an area where Canon dSLR products trample Pentax like Godzilla over Tokyo - and the K100D's irritating reliance on AA batteries for power. Actually, the battery issue is a classic \"mixed bag\"; rechargable AAs are available almost everywhere and cost much less than dedicated batteries. Their performance in actual use - based on my experience of shooting over a few thousand images to date and editing on the run via the LCD -  comes up far short when compared to the BP-511A battery packs for the 20D. Carrying a pocketful of a dozen charged AAs is a burden, too. I hope that Pentax will ditch the AAs and move on to a more powerful single battery for the K100D's eventual successor.The last question, then, is the age old one of \"Would I buy this camera again?\" The answer: a solid \"Maybe\". There certainly is a lot to love about the K100D - it feels good in the hand; it takes a wide range of Pentax and Pentax-friendly lenses; images at 200 & 400 ISOs when taken in good light can be wonderful in color and saturation, and it's not another tacky Canon Rebel or dumbed-down Nikon. For what it is and at its price point, this little Pentax offers an attactive camera for undemanding dSLR users. More experienced shooters who are unwilling to overlook the K100D's many limitations may want to keep looking or wait for Pentax to evolve its dSLR line even further before hopping on the Pentax bus.", "Date": "May 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "phillydenizen \"PM\"", "ReviewID": "R1QHY6CCFMEW9D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having much experience with DSLR's over the past three years, I was initially reluctant in plunking down my money for the K100D having used Nikon almost exclusively.

Side by side, the Nikon's images looked really great and sharp directly from the camera's auto function, and because this camera would also be used by my wife, I thought that would be nice, since she is not as much of an enthusiast as I am.  I enjoy manually adjusting settings.I did online comparisons on every single review website out there.  I liked the Pentax's natural looking color tones.  Some people say they are too warm.  I like this as opposed to the colder images of the other camera.  The D40 seems like a very reliable brand family to enter and since they are so popular it would be good to fit in with everyone else on the streets shooting away.  I still wasn't sure until going into a store to look at each one side by side.  I started with the D40.  It felt good, the menu looks good, the manual focus part of the lens felt like a toy.  And it was very lightweight.I picked up the K100D and the feeling was a lot different.  The camera has a nice bit of weight to it.  The finish and the exterior is really nice. It feels and looks like more of a professional camera than a consumer/entry/beginner level DSLR unlike the D40 (even worse--the XT/XTI) I looked through the viewfinder and felt right at home, starting to take pictures and lost my focus on trying to inspect the camera for purchasing.  Some people complain about autofocus noise, shutter noise, or the autofocus hunting in the dark.  I feel that there are some who's hearing is extremly sensitive or they are shooting primarily in libraries and churches.  After working with this camera, the auto focus is fast.  If it misses focus (maybe 1 out of 10 times)you press the button again and it always finds it right away.  You wasted maybe 1 second.  All point and shoot cameras I had before were MUCH worse in this category.  If you are into manual focusing I do not think it is actually possible to be physically fast than if you went with auto focus.Images look really balanced right out of the camera.  Not as sharp as the D40, but this is ONLY because of a difference in processing style.  I have read about Pentax's imaging philosophy and for me it really makes sense.  The in camera processing is not heavy-handed.  They are going for a more film-like appearance.  This means lighting which casts a warm hue takes a warm hue in the image rather than always looking like cool white  fluorescent lighting.  The images just looks more natural.  The same for the ISO settings which are not over laden with noise reduction.  Yes you get grain at 1600 ISO (as with every camera) but the grain is actually more film like.  Detail is not missing like the other's happy processing engines.  For these reasons, I would say the K100D seems more like an photo enthusiast's camera, the D40 seems more like its designed as point and shoot DSLR.I think that this camera is good for the whole range of people who want to shoot.

Others have noted auto white balance is not reliable, and I agree.  However, it is easy to set white balance manually.  Most of the time autofocus works well and is fast, however on a couple of occasions I've found the AF would not lock or got confused, then I had to focus manually.  The use of AA batteries may be a plus or a minus depending on your viewpoint -- I consider it an advantage, especially since it can also use CR-V3 lithiums (not rechargeable).  I have successfully used both alkalines and rechargeable NiMHs in mine so far, and battery life is quite acceptable to me.The camera has a lot of automated shooting modes of questionable value, and the default images with \"bright\" setting are over-processed and too saturated.  Serious photographers will ignore the automatic modes and switch processing to the \"natural\" setting.  The 18-55mm kit lens is versatile and I'm sure many beginners will be happy with it.  If you outgrow it there is a huge catalog of Pentax lenses, old and new, which will work on this camera.

Compared to my old (early 1980s) SLR, manual adjustments of focus, aperture and shutter speed feel slow and awkward, but this seems to be a common trait of most DSLRs.  I decided it's best to rely on the automated features for most snapshots and save manual adjustments for posed or staged photos when there is time to fiddle with them.

The live view feature of the Olympus line was attractive, but the image quality reviews I read were more favorable for the Pentax than for the Olympus or the Sony.(b) Pentax advertises the fact that the cameras are backward compatible with numerous older manual / older auto focus lenses - to a far greater degree than other competing brands. This was not a deciding factor for me as I did not anticipate wanting to buy such lenses.(c) I searched the internet and read reviews comparing numerous cameras / lens systems and Pentax does seem to have a strong reputation for very high quality lenses at reasonable prices.(d) as against the K10D - this camera is at least two to three hundred dollars cheaper. It has numerous shooting \"modes\" similar to a point and shoot camera such as portrait/action/night shorts etc.. that should help a newcomer to these type of cameras. The K10D is a higher specification camera with a lot of control options that provide experienced photographers with better control - however I, as a beginner, preferred the simpler K100d. The K100D has an ISO capability of upto ISO 3200 and is said to be a better low-light performer.For a person like me (limited budget, new to digital photography wanting to move up from point and shoot) this camera has been a very good fit and I am happy with the purchase. Buying the 18-55mm lens together with the camera helped me learn how to use the camera. It also gave me an idea of what other lenses I would need.  Subsequently, I bought a zoom lens for range greater than 55mm.ps: a new \"super\" k100d is expected to be released that has the ability to use the soon to be released Pentax DA* SDM lenses. The 'super' model also has in camera dust reduction. However, I am told that in case you want to use the new lenses, the current K100D model is compatible and operates at the regular auto focus speed, without the fast focusing SDM feature. The current model is fast enough for my current skill level and I am not too concerned.I have enjoyed my past few months with the K100D + lens and have nothing negative to report.

I really feel I have \"arrived\" with a real DSLR camera. I've been thru a number of point and shoot digital cameras including kodak (2), Nikon(2), Canon A95,Canon S2is.  And also used a canon DSLR D60 ($1200. camera) at work.  I absolutely loved the S2iS which took great pictures, especially in conjunction with Adobe Photoshop with really remarkable results. The Canon D60 was not a good camera in low light, even considering that I did not have great lights. It was also extremely heavy to hold and around the neck.  Even the Nikon 4300 (4MP) worked better than D60 with average studio lights, and took great quality pics.Back to the k100d.  Easy and fun to use.  Perfect weight and balance.Amazing sensor stabilization (every bit as good as S2is,and probably better stabilization). I plan to buy one or two used Pentax lenses although the l8-55 mm is excellent all around. Picture quality: I couldn't believe the great low-light performance! I took shots at 1/10th of a second at iso 800, in my living room, with no flash, that are better than any indoor shots I ever took even with a flash. The noise is practically non-existent up to iso 800. When the family is around and I'm taking snapshots I use the onboard flash along with a handheld slave (Phoenix) flash that helps keep the lighting absolutely natural looking and works great under different conditions (like with no lamps on).  My outdoor shots were easy and wonderful.  If over-saturated I can easily tone down the colors in Photoshop.  I wish there was a way to adjust color saturation in automatic but it doesn't seem doable.  Maybe I'll try in Program mode.

The autofocus is not the fastest, but it should be sufficient for most people.  Some people have also said that the buffer is a little small, but this depends on how you shoot and it does not bother me.  My main complaint with this camera is that the auto white balance goes a little weird under tungston lights, but if you change the WB to tungston lights, this fixes it.  I also recommend changeing the camera from the default bright color setting to the natural color setting for more normal looking images.This camera should satisfy all but the professional, perhaps, who needs some really advanced features.  I have had no difficulty finding lenses for this camera since they are easily availible online and there are many great choices.

The K100D came highly recommended by (biased) Pentax owners. Every Canon and Nikon (also biased) owners sworn by their own brands. My roommate and his brother own Canons, a Rebel XT and a 30D. Compared to either one, the Pentax loses hands down to many aspects. However, I wouldn't trade it for the Rebel (30D is another story). I love this camera for its personality (this isn't something I can explain or put on paper, it just has that \"I don't give a crap\" attitude to me). It can take pictures with mouth watering colors out of the box, it can take photos with natural colors for editing later and it does it with a familiar and pleasing SLR shutter sound. Out of all the DSLR's I've tried, the K100D snaps with the most confident sound. The K100D also feels the most film like DSLR I've held. Even though other cameras can take sharper pictures with less noise, have bigger buffers and faster AF, the K100D felt more natural to me. Because of this, I feel more comfortable in progressing my photography skills and feel more confident about taking more shots of my subjects. Mega pixels and ISO noise responses don't help in that department. And so even though the Rebel can beat the K100D on paper, my photos tell a different story.My 2 biggest complaints regarding this camera is its small buffer for continuous shots and the useful but poorly implemented post processing filters. Well, actually, it is because the auto white balance for indoor lighting is either yellow or blue, I sometimes need to use post processing to correct the pictures. The filters must be applied one setting at a time and cannot be applied to multiple photos. Even though I can do the same on a PC, it really renders the filters option a lot less useful. Aside from these negatives, the ergonomics and shake reduction make this camera a winner in my book.But to serious camera shoppers, don't pay so much attention to specs and actually try several cameras out before buying.

Don't use Auto mode. Use P mode and use the dedicated 'Tungsten' WB mode.3. Don't use incandescent bulbs! Use CFL lights instead.

I looked at everyone's reviews including the \"professional ones\". I am happy with this camera. It takes great pictures. Now, having said that I will tell you about the little bugs, or things that I don't like about the camera.. things others didn't talk about...  First, there are a LOT of automatic settings on this camera. They cover just about any situation that you could want. The problem with this is that there is no control over some of the menu items in these. I would like to take a macro shot of a orange/pink tulip, but it comes out RED because I can't adjust the Saturation, Sharpness, Contrast, or even the Natural/ Vivid color.. So I have to do it manually which is a bit tiresome. So the menus that are NOT avaliable during scene & automatic modes affects the outcome of the photo.  Secondly.. If you shoot in any quality other than RAW, you might as well just throw the included software in the garbage. It only touches up & manipulates RAW images. There is nothing on the disc to help out with jPeg files. That is a waste.  Third... & this is just a minor thing.  I usually take landscape photos, & the ISO only goes down to 200. My olympus point & shoot C-765 goes down to an ISO of 64. Who needs ISO of 3200 when the shutter speed gives a range of 30 seconds to 1/4000 of a second. Just seems as though they went too high with the ISO.  Overall I am really happy with my purchase. I just wish that Pentax would have written the software to manipulate the photo while I am taking it so I don't have to sit at my computer all day dinking with it.. & yes, I said DINKING!! It is called digital photography, not computer photography!!! The anti shake seems to work well, & the lens takes good pictures. Good camera, just with a few problems.. or rather bugs..

Best deal on the market in my opinion.~Great image quality!  Coming from three different compact digicams (Olympus 740, Panasonic LZ3, and my still-good Fuji F30) this is a big step up.~Six megapixels is plenty for all regular print sizes; don't fall for the marketing hype pushing consumers towards more and more megapixels unless you intend to print big.~Shake reduction works!  I've taken handheld shots in crappy indoor lighting with a manual 200mm telephoto at shutter speeds as low as 1/50th second (the rule of thumb suggests shutter speeds faster than 1/focal length, in this case 1/200th second).  Not crystal clear, but definitely usable for small prints and web posting.~Extensive compatibility with a long history of Pentax K-mount lenses.  I've got a 3rd-party M42 screwmount adapter to use some old fully manual Spotmatic lenses I bought cheap.~Not too heavy for me, not too light.~Feels good in my right hand, though my fingernails will bump against the body if not kept trimmed.~Customizable auto-ISO.~Good viewfinder and LCD screen.~Uses AA batteries.~Love that solid mirror/shutter release sound!Cons:~Continuous shooting is relatively limited, but for single frame shot-to-shot speed the camera is perfectly usable.~Menus are just laggy enough in my opinion to be slightly annoying.~Speaking of speed, the only need you'll have for the super-fast flash memory cards is for directly transferring files to your computer...the ~K100D won't save or display pictures any faster with the top-end memory cards.~Speaking of memory cards, RAW files are not compressed...so you can't fit more than 90 shots on a 1 gig SD card (I've got 2 SanDisk Ultra II 1GB cards and have ordered a 2GB PQI 60x SD card for the extra space).~Operating the camera would be a bit faster if the 4-way controller directly adjusted ISO, white balance, drive mode, and flash rather than going through the Function menu first.~The left handgrip strip is grippy but too small...better if Pentax had just covered that side in the same material as the right grip.~The included software works fine but feels lethargic at times.~Auto-ISO is reset back to ISO 200 whenever you use exposure compensation.~That reassuringly solid mirror/shutter sound unfortunately means this camera won't win any awards for stealth.This is my first DSLR and I've taken more pictures in the 3 weeks I've owned it than in almost any other month of picture-taking in the last 2 years.If you're wondering about the K100D Super, the only advantages it has that are worth noting are a mildly effective dust-prevention and dust-removal system and the ability to use the new Pentax SDM lenses and their silent and marginally faster autofocus.  These lenses are expensive now and should be for some time.  Since the speed, menus, buffer, external controls, and other important features were left unchanged, I had no reason to buy the Super.I'm using Sanyon Eneloop AA rechargeable batteries and highly recommend them.  They hold a charge for a long time, offer plenty of power, and don't confuse the K100D's electrical system like some AAs do.Bottom Line...DSLRs can be tweaked to match the colors, sharpness, and contrast of just about any other DSLR.  Your abilities as a photographer and your lens will have a greater impact on image quality than how strong a scene's reds are saturated in the default settings that come with your camera.  Unless you need extensive control over your camera, high frame rates, or big resolution to crop extensively or print larger than poster size...there's nothing wrong in buying a DSLR body like this one and spending the money saved on photography classes or a nice lens.", "Date": "September 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "K100D+18-55mm zoom", "Author": "Larry Scrabeck", "ReviewID": "R292NSVHNC8YGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I finally added the K100D to my Pentax collection.

True, few utilized the flash but I am very happy with the quantity. The pictures have been great. Very sharp images with very high resolution. Color has been true. I have taken a lot of indoor volleyball shots and the point that the ball is hit by the player has been sharp as well. A lot better after switching off anti-shake (which I'm sure works but I haven't gotten that far yet).Quickly reviewing shots is a snap as the feature has it's own button on the rear. This way no movement of the main selector is necessary. Also the function (fn) button has some pre-set functions that are easy to find. One being the shutter release functions. Just pressing this button and the menu \"up\" bring you to the 2-second, 12-second, continuous and other settings. 2-second is great for shooting a steady subject with a long lens, shake free. Just tripod mount the camera, set up the shot and go to the 2-second mode.

IT is simple to switch from auto to manual focus, with a switch within reach while holding the camera to your eye.  It also has outstanding battery life.  I have the sandisk extreme III 2 GB card for this baby (no write-time issues whatsoever), and it gives me 689 pictures to the card. As an experiment, I filled the card full, taking over 50 of those shots with the flash on (all with autofocus and shake-reduction on), and then formatted the card again, and it still showed FULL BATTERY!  I use 4 Sony 2500mAH AA batteries.  I also got approximately 200 shots from the alkaline batteries that came with the camera.  From my experience with my old digicam, this is astounding!  I was getting MAYBE 40 pictures @ 4MP from 2 AA batteries.  Certainly no flash, shake reduction or focusing!There are some drawbacks, however.  I feel as though there is no perfect place to put my left hand on the camera, which feels odd to me, considering I am left-handed.  The pictures become very grainy using auto mode in bright sunlight, even with the tulip shade on the lens, because of the camera trying to use a very high ISO.  This can be rectified easily, though, by adjusting the ISO to a lower level manually (I use 800) in the Function button menu.Overall, this camera is great and thus receives 5 stars from me.  The fit and finish is wonderful, the pictures are crisp and clean when taken correctly, and the ease of use means that almost any computer- or electronics- illiterate person can use it perfectly well.

It was a no brainer for me because I currently own 9 vintage Pentax Takumar lenses (and I'm still always looking to collect more). It has excellent build quality, reflecting on Pentax's history of solid cameras (I also own a Pentax Spotmatic film slr from the 1960's). The camera is very user friendly (although in the menu's, some of the abbreviations that Pentax uses for some of the functions are REALLY, REALLY HARD TO FIGURE OUT!!!!! ARGGGGGGG!!!!!). That is my only gripe though. The camera has manual focus indicator for my old screwmount Takumars and plenty of dipotre adjustments to help with proper focusing, which helps someone with glasses like me (the manual focus indicator seems to be a little nitpicky sometimes, so you have to have patience, especially in certain lighting situations; that is what I have observed). The camera is solid, with a steel chasis and polycarbonite plastic body and super awesome grip. It uses 4AA batteries which I LOVE and SD memory. You will need to download the latest firmware upgrade to it so it will accept SDHC cards (high capacity SD memory basically) which was really easy to do.

Clark \"Photo bug\"", "ReviewID": "R2BJGOM85SUWQT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used Pentax cameras for nearly 50 years (47 to be exact). I started with a Honeywell Pentax H3 which is a manual only camera and did not have built in light meter. I used it for many years and got top notch service from it. I used a hand held Yashika spot light meter and was able to do a lot with this camera. I then moved into a Spotmatic and was able to use all my screw mount lenses from the H3 with it. I have lost track of how many pictures I have taken with these two and have always been satisfied. I have always liked the solid feel of the metal framed cameras and their ruggedness. I even got some great pictures in the UK one February when it was so cold out that the shutter did not reset when tripped, but I did not lose any shots.I moved to a PZ-20 camera in 1995 with the K mount lenses and have used it extensively. I have the 28-80mm and 100-300mm f/3.5-4.5 zoom lenses that had image tracking. This camera system has been great. With the help of a Pro T flash bracket, I was able to do a professional job of my son's wedding.I added the K100D about 4 or 5 years ago. I have lost track now but I have had excellent success with the camera. I purchased the unit with the 18-55mm f/3.5-4.5 kit lens and have been very happy with it. I really like the lens hood supplied with it and the way it stores on the lens when not in use.I have been able to use both of my prior KAF lenses from my PZ-20 and that is one of the reasons I got a Pentax Digital SLR. The other reasons are that the quality has been excellent on all of my cameras. I have retired the H3 and do not use it much because the silk shutter is not repairable if it breaks. The Spotmatic is still going strong and has given excellent service even though I purchased it used for $100. A great bargain for sure.I find that the K100D is just as intuitive and easy to use in any mode as was my PZ20. The principles I learned while using the H3 and Spotmatic have provided me with a lot of insight into what it takes to get great pictures.One thing I have learned over the years is that you take many pictures so that you have the best chance of getting some great ones.I like the AA format of the batteries for the K100. I can use either the specialized batteries or 4 AAs. One thing I have found is that if the Eveready Lithium batteries are used you get a lot more pictures. I also use 2GB SD cards all the time. I shoot in camera raw mode almost exclusively. You get a lot more quality to start with and can then save the pictures as jpg if needed although I find that the TIFF format has less loss in compression, so I will use it more often. I can get close to 200 pictures on a 2GB SD card.On our vacation last year to Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park, Canyon deChelly, Valley of the Gods, Arches National Park, Canyonlands National Park, Goosenecks State Park, and Dead Horse Point State Park. I took 700 digital photos and also shot 11 rolls of 35mm film in my PZ20. When you are only going to be at a location once or twice, the extra photos pay off greatly.I have not found any real problems with the K100D and am very satisfied with it. The quality of the pictures is excellent for digital photos and the 6.1 MP has not been a disadvantage. Perhaps some day I might pick up a Pentax body with more resolution but only if it is justified. At the present time, I am doing great with my PZ20 and K100D systems and lenses.I would recommend the Pentax cameras to anyone that wants good solid value for the money spent.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "6 beautiful megapixels", "Author": "Chris Cunningham", "ReviewID": "R3NXW5W39BVY14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No wonder reviewers have had so much good to say about this camera's image quality, it really is that good.  Obviously, I'm really impressed with this camera, but for good reason.  It's moderately priced, includes in-body shake reduction, and even better, really produces fantastics images.  I haven't tried to enlarge more than 8x10, but I suspect that with a little work on my part, this camera could do much larger sized prints. Despite the megapixel race in the DSLR market, leading to high end and higher end cameras that start at 10MP or up,  I think there's a place for nice, light, sturdy, compact and capable camera.  I personally can't tell the difference between 10MP and 6MP at 8x10 sizes, and I remember when the high end pro-level dslrs were running at 6MP(it wasn't that long ago).  Nikon and Pentax are the last of the companies offering nice 6MP entry level models, and it's kind of a shame.

These old lenses don't allow for the auto focus so some adjustments need to be made with the functions menus before the camera will take pictures. Once that's done, they work great. The Shake Reduction is a real asset with a telephoto. One consideration is that the digital format effectively increases the focal length by a factor of 1.5 so a 600mm lens becomes in effect a 900mm lens. Fine for telephoto but it's not so good for wide angle when a 28 mm lens becomes a 42 mm lens.  If you're into wide angle, it's probably better to buy the camera-lens package.", "Date": "October 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "I've had this camera for about 9 months and I am truly in love with it.", "Author": "Shannon", "ReviewID": "R2G3GX6G2WH2QI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, it doesn't have that flimsy digitial-camera feel, like others in it's price range. It is solid and sturdy (survived a bit of a drop!) and it feels amazing in your hands. The grip is really deep, the buttons are firm, and all the doors have a nice spring shut. It's very satisfying to handle (making it hard to stop taking pictures)It's a great travel camera.I've brought this camera to England and Japan and I was impressed with the results. The auto modes are quick and easy with a great outcome, when time is of the essence. But I was also able to get some great long-exposure pictures of city lights with my bare hands. The image stabilization really shown when I could read the time on the shot of Big Ben when the cars below were a blur.It also switches very quickly and easily between auto and manual, if you just want to adjust the focus or the exposure a bit.I like the fact that you can switch out the old lenses, becuase my dad has a few of them, but I haven't had the need to. the 18-55 gives as much range as I need and then some.The WB indoors is a bit of in issue, but it is easily fixed by adjusting the setting (or by using flash, which is good for what it is, but flash is gross). And the sharpness of the picture rarely decreases in low light, so sometimes I embrace the orange hues. Orange can be nice.I also love that it runs on AA. The rechargable ones were cheap and they keep it running forever! (and, when you're desperate, there's another option)If you're doing what I was doing and looking to upgrade from point and shoot, this camera is really worth your time and money. I have very little photography experience and I've become fairly good with this simply through trial and error. Also, the quality of SLR pictures is worth the added expense. Exact focus, vivid color, and no delay.

I use to take photo's for a school yearbook, but now photography is just a hobby and I take a lot of quick point and shoot type photo's for work.  I got this almost a year ago and love the camera and the Sigma 70-300mm lens I got along with it, but I get a much better quality picture with the sigma lens, the kit lens will only take ok pictures, I would suggest buying the body and getting a better lens to start rather getting a kit lens just to replace it later. I was very impressed with the anti shake feature, free handedly taking picture in low light with .5 to 1 second shutter speed and still getting a decent photo. In my opinion, this camera has a great battery life, with the energizer rechargeable 2500 mah batteries I can typically get around 800 photo's as long as I do not use the screen to view picture that much and don't let the batteries sit since they seem to loose a lot of there charge from sitting.  The auto focus is good when you have enough light, but when there is very little light you mines as well just turn it off, I am not sure how this compares to other DSLR's because this is my first camera with auto focus. The auto mode for the aperture and shutter speed work to get a decent photo, that is what my camera is set to most of the time, but sometimes the picture is just a little underexposed. Overall the color is pretty good, but you sometimes may have to photoshop to help with the contrast and brightness. I have never had to take the contrast down with this camera, but have often had to add more to it, but that is an easy fix on the computer.  When you go to buy memory cards, there is a noticeable difference from the standard to the extreme III cards, I have all extreme cards, but my grandpa uses ultra 2, I would recommend getting at least an ultra 2 card and not bother with the standard cards. The speed of the camera is pretty decent for consecutive pictures, you can take 5 consecutive pictures with no waiting between pictures on the highest quality, unlike the point and shoot camera's that take several seconds to take the next photo.  Overall I would recommend this camera to anyone looking into getting into photography for fun or hobby as it is a great camera for the price, if you are looking for professional quality, then you of course will want to look towards a higher end camera that has more to offer, but if your not working for a big magazine company, then why bother with the hundreds of bucks more for a slightly better photo.Great camera, just needs a better lens.", "Date": "December 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "much better than point and shoot", "Author": "vagrant10 \"mh\"", "ReviewID": "R5214G4U6263S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "much better depth and detail than my canon a80 which I thought was very good.  took some pictures of my nephew who's less than a year old but didn't want to use a flash that would scare her, and the pics were amazing.  great color, her blue eyes just sparkled and the detail of her fine hair was great... and this was just with light coming through the window.  also, lots of detail in dark areas.

When I first got the camera I was AMAZED at the quality of photos, the built in shake reduction worked wonders and the auto focus was pretty quick. The kit lenses are very good and I still use the 18-55mm for 'general' shots to this day.After I got those 2 lenses I couldn't stop there, I went on an auction site, pawn shops, camera shops, and on Amazon and got some sweet deals,My first purchase after I got the camera was a standalone flash unit, After 2 weeks of looking around I finally settled on a Vitar unit that works very well and got it for $50 (was the last one, and was being discontinued) After that I went to a used camera shop and picked up and older small Pentax brand camera bag, and a lens carrier for $5 (they were both in 'make me an offer' bins)Shortly after that I went to a pawn shop and seen another Pentax brand bag (was much larger, and with some new lenses on the way was just what I needed) I opened it up and it was an older film Pentax (was an auto focus model) and it has 2 Pentax lenses in there I instantly scooped it up for $55 (can remember the mm of them don't have the lenses here:D)Then on amazon I piked up a few more lenses (A Takumar, and a mirror type lens) Both were long range type and both suited my needs. I then went on a certain auction site and picked up 7-8 lenses there, they were all either Pentax or Asahai Pentax and included a fisheye,pancake and other various sizes, unfortunately all the sliver limited edition lenses constantly went above my price limit. Now with all those lenses I needed a camera backpack, I got one for cheap ($25) It was waterproof and had very thick padding, even tho it was cheap, to this day it has held up well with no rips.The Pentax K100D is a very rugged camera for the first year of its life it was used constantly I took it everywhere, And even now the LCD is scratch free and the camera body looks like I just bought it yesterday!Unfortunately, after I had used this camera for a year, I lost interest  in amateur photography all together, It sat in its case for over a year before I finally decided to get into it again. And even tho now it seen as 'old' and 'outdated' It still takes suburb shots, I don't think however I'll be getting anymore lenses for it anytime soon.

They make great cameras too, but I'll stick with my Pentax. It does everything I want, and I know Pentax makes sturdy, reliable equipment that lasts a long time.

If you prefer RAW format, this camera does it too, but with much more space required per picture.  You can take professional pictures quickly and easily with this camera.  The only complaint that I have about this camera is the relatively slow Buffer/Memory Writer that disallows you from taking really rapid continuous shots.  Otherwise, pair this camera with some NiMH batteries from Sony w/ charger (19.99 on amazon) and I've taken over 3000 pictures with flash before the Low Battery indicator started flashing!

After half a day I was taking great photos in point-and-shoot mode. Two days later I was taking stunning photos in point-and-shoot, and a week later I was manually controlling the  settings and using the various situation-specific modes to take better photos than I've ever taken before. I often take 500-600 photos of any occasion now and end up with a dozen killer shots. Friends think I'm a great amateur photographer, I really just keep the volume high enough that the percentages are in my favor, and this camera is perfect for this kind of volume.My friend has a Nikon D40 that is equivalent to this camera in picture quality, and another friend has the digital Rebel. I'd say all of these cameras are on par with each other, the only major advantage of the Pentax is found in the \"Super\" version, which is capable of automatically removing dust from the sensor every time the camera is powered on, essential if you change lenses often in less-than-ideal environments. The Canon seems to have a better AF, the Nikon seems to be, overall, the easiest to use.

The camera strikes a nice balance between features and usability that both the amateur and professional photographer can appreciate.The big difference between this camera (K110D) and the K100D is that his camera doesn't have shake-reduction.The lens kit is very nice. Also, Pentax made this camera backward-compatible with it's old lenses, so you can take advantage of many of the high-quality lenses available on eBay at a fraction of the cost. This camera is especially good for the beginning/amateur photographer, and Pentax quality at this price is well worth it. In fact, this is the lowest-price digital SLR out there.Note: One thing you might want to know is that with virtually every digital SLR camera, you cannot use the LCD screen as a viewfinder like you can with the point-and-shoot cameras. Many people spend weeks trying to figure-out how to use their LCD screen as a viewfinder and its simply not done on SLR cameras because the internal mirror (that makes it a single lens reflex camera) is covering the image sensor (CCD chip) so the LCD can only show the picture once it has been taken. Also, because of this, you cannot shoot movies/mpegs like you can on point-and-shoot.

I understood that I could use my older Pentax lens, a 35-70 and a 50-200, but I did not understand that they would not work with the auto focus feature.  I most likely will have to buy a 18-200 auto focus Tamron lens to be satisfied with my needs, because Pentax does not have an equivalent.  I think the camera, itself, is o.k. llb", "Date": "January 5, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$930.00", "Features": "6.1-megapixel CCD captures enough detail for photo-quality 14 x 19-inch prints\n2.5-inch color LCD monitor; 11-point wide-frame AF\nIn-camera Shake Reduction (SR) system to combat blur from hand shake or low light\nAuto sensitivity control up to ISO equivalent 3200\nStores images on SD memory cards; powered by 2 CR-V3 lithium batteries or 4 AA-size batteries", "Name": "Pentax K100D 6.1MP Digital SLR Camera Shake Reduction (Body Only)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41B89SGRS7L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000G1DAKA"}}
