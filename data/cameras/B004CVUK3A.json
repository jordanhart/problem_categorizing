Other, more expensive products weren't as good as this unit. The day and night vision abilities are pretty good considering it's not an HD cam. It's wireless setup was very simple, easy and quick, and the unit has a 270 degree field sweep side to side and 100 degrees up and down. I use my camera for front door security and seeing what's up in the front yard. Day or night it has a good range, and for night vision it will see 100 or so feet. I'd definitely buy another of these if I had need. It was well packed and quickly shipped too. All in all, I'm very satisfied with this product.", "Date": "February 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "presets are lost when the power is cut", "Author": "Tuncer", "ReviewID": "RHCCN6LFQP5CF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I should say that it has the best picture quality among four cams I have. One problem is that the preset locations do not survive a power loss. The other problem is that the motion detection is quite poor. One can not create a subframe within the viewframe for motion detection, like one could do with the linksys cameras. Recording on the sd card fails frequently. I guess it fails when the card fills up and overwrite option does not work properly.  In addition, when the motion detection is on, and you move the camera, it starts recording as if it detects motion! That is,  the hardware is good, but the software sucks big time...New: I also noticed that video recording and ftp uploads do not work simultaneously. For more than a year there is no firmware update either.", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Hardware, Bad Software", "Author": "Melonduck", "ReviewID": "R3PEQ57ONVFOKG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera a couple weeks ago. It had complete packaging, but the manual is garbage. It's too hard to understand and has too many broken English. I spent several hours trying to figure out what the hell was wrong with the camera since it kept showing 404 error page whenever I tried to view it using a web browser. It turned out the camera itself was missing the Web Interface firmware. So, I had to go to easyn.com website to download the latest System firmware and Web Interface firmware. Then, I used the camera installation software to update both firmwares in the camera. The installation software kept saying firmware update failed, but it actually took it. The FAQ section on their website also sucks. In conclusion, you have to be a genius to make this camera work.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great stand alone IP webcam", "Author": "Tech Engineer \"Al\"", "ReviewID": "R1JYYW47S3I35C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is really great, I would have given 5 STARS but my daughter clicked the same link and got two of them - one had different name (HOOTOO) in the software instead of EasyN. I have the EasyN and love it. The HOOTOO version came with software that looks the same but keeps trying to open an Internet explorer window. DON'T allow this to open, my Anti-virus software on multiple computers identified this as a malicious TROJAN!We love that we can visit our grandchildren and see them - and they can see us on our's. Product has audio too, but we haven't had any success with using that for video conferencing. Has Listen button and talk button but feedback is terrible if you enable both at the same time (we tried using just one Camera for the audio, while using both for two-way video). We now just use Cell phone on speaker phone mode for audio and the video is excellent.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.99", "Features": "Remote-controllable high-speed pan/tilt mechanism\nWireless LAN & built-in DDNS\nImage transmission using an e-mail or FTP\nHigh-quality monitoring via the network\nIntelligent object detection function ,Multiple Applications Supported", "Name": "Esky Wireless Infrared Motion Night Vision Network Color Camera Pan & Tilt, 2-way audio", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4195%2B7mNDTL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004CVUK3A"}}
