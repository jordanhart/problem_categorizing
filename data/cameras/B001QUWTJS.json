{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Camera for Fun", "Author": "Conrad C. Cline \"Phoenix\"", "ReviewID": "R35TSRDG1HD2MM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife got this camera from her parents because we are expecting our first child. I myself am a big tech junkie and program and build computers and other electronics. I have been severely avoiding any digital camera. Why? because 35mm is just better quality pictures. (I love my Nikon N75 SLR.I am, however, setting up with a Canon hv30 for video lol).The good: This camera takes good pictures, and the flash setting doesnt overwhelm like some flash does on digital camera. The camera avoid blur very well, which is surprising because we have a hyperactive cats that never stays still for picture and we have a couple dozen perfectly done pictures at least. the camera is a nice size for carrying around and can be operated easily with one hand. The LCD screen gives a very good overview of the pictures being taken and allows you to be able to review pictures and adjust the settings easily. There is also good room for storage, both internal and external. Easy transfer to computer, and a nice spot to plug in my flexipod desk tripod as well as other accessories. The autozoom is nice and the ability to use a two step button is helpful when you want to test the resolution or quality of a shot on the lcd before actually taking the picture.The bad: The camera has no good viewfinder, but then again no real use for one. Battery life on good batteries wears with the flash, but that can be the same on most cameras. There are not as many customizable settings on the phone which can leave you to wanting to just do point and shoot. (Which is good for some people, but I like fine tuning) The settings though do cover all the basics and little more. The zoom is a bit delayed and takes a couple clicks of the button to get the zoom started. There is a nice indicator showing where the normal zoom stops and digital zoom begins, but it also stops the zoom right there on the separation and doesnt make it a clean and seamless transition. It takes a moment to take the shot, mainly because of the flash. The aperature tends to give too dark of photos without a flash, and when you turn off the flash is sets exposure time to high and can cause blur if there is any motion.Overall: I give them camera a good review because it is  nice camera for the quick, out of the box, a bit more than expected point and shoot. Not for people wanting to make art or award winning photos, but if you want to take fun pictures of the cruise or baseball game. My wife doesnt want to give this camera up, and to be honest neither do I. I love my 35mm nikon n75 slr camera, and I would take that over this camera anyday. Though, being able to take multiple shots of whatever I want and not pay for developing costs and film is a great advantage. However, when it comes down to very important, gotta have it, no mistakes pictures, I would trust me 35mm better over any digital camera.If you are looking for a fun camera that is at a good cost then this one is a good buy. Easy pictures, easy use, one handed shot or two handed shots whichever you prefer. Good stabilization on pictures, good light balancing, crisper shots than expected, and easy storage and transfer. Take this next time you want to make sure you have a good camera on hand without having to carry around a camera bag for a film camera. Just don't expect to go winning any art shows.", "Date": "March 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "NoMoreSanyoEver", "Author": "JLS", "ReviewID": "R19WDC4904JIZV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased the vpc -S1285W which is basically this camera only 12 megapixel from WalMart.  I could not find it on Amazon so I am putting this review under this one. We purchased the camera for our daughter for Christmas.  We purchased the camera in 11/09 but it was in the package until 12/25/2009.  My daughter was thrilled to receive it - this was her first camera.  I was actually pretty pleased for the price at first.  She has used it lightly (maybe taking 40-50 pictures) since Christmas.  She took it the other day to take pictures of her brother at an Easter Egg hunt and when she turned it on the LCD screen was white.  We cannot see any images in the screen.  I contacted Sanyo customer service and they informed me that since we were past the 90 day warranty it was going to have to be sent in for repair - repair that would most likely cost up to $100.  The camera only cost $79 new!  I responded back to them with my disappointment at the quality of the camera and felt it should be replaced.  They never got back with me.  Just moved the status of the complaint to \"solved\". I have never received more dismissive customer service in my life!  I will NEVER by a Sanyo product again.  We basically have to throw this camera away after three months!My only recourse at this point is to share my experience with others.  My mother in law sent her three year old Olympus in for repair and they only charged $50.  My advice is to spend a little more and buy from a better company.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Don't let the price and the 10mp fool you!", "Author": "J. Bosque \"FlyFly\"", "ReviewID": "R19T285FKXGJFG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this on Christmas at a Walmart store because it was on a good price and it was 10mp. It doesn't have rechargeable batteries and it doesn't include an AC cord either. You just get the camera with the software, 2AA regular batteries, a USB cable, and a little pouch to put the camera in, which doesn't protect it at all. I had to return it because once I downloaded the pictures to my PC...some of them were gone on the camera. It just showed the screen completely black on some of them, as if a picture was there, but it was not showing the image or it was corrupted. We tested the SD card several times, and it was the camera that had the issue. So, I exchanged it and got myself the Panasonic Lumix...and that one's NICE!! I have kept using the same SD card with the Lumix, and have had no problems at all...so it really was the Sanyo the one with the issue. The price sounds nice and it is 10mp, but don't let that fool you. It was not worth it for me.", "Date": "April 10, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Sanyo VPC-S1080 10 MP 3x Optical/4x Digital Zoom Camera General Features: Blue color 10 megapixel\n3x optical zoom 4x digital zoom Large 2.8-inch LCD screen Digital Image Stabilizer\nFace Detection Technology Smile Detection Red-Eye removal 16 MB internal memory\nSupports SD/SDHC memory cards up to 4 GB Lens Features: Aperture Range: 2.8 (W) - 5.2 (T)\nFocal Length: 5.7 mm - 17.1 mm (equivalent to 34 mm - 102 mm on a 35 mm camera)", "Name": "Sanyo Xacti VPC-S1080 10MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom 2.8 LCD - Blue\"", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HRpnXkRWL.jpg", "ProductID": "B001QUWTJS"}}
