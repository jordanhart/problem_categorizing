The night vision is exceptional. I'm not sure its 100 feet but gives a good quality lit image at a good distance.Built very sturdy and comes with adjustable sun/weather shade. You will not find a better varifocal camera at this price.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "CAUTION,  PRODUCT IS NOT WATERPROOF.", "Author": "AUGUST SHINWALD", "ReviewID": "R32CU9OU5YA7XO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Caution, product is not water proof.  There are 2 wires emerging from the guts of the product.  One has a BNC connector for video output. There is no manual that describes anything about interfacing the camera with external devices.  Both the BNC connector for video nor the electrical connector are water proof.  There is absolutely no manual.  There is a \"specification\" sheet which is just that.  I have been in the electronics business since graduating from MIT in 1961.  This may be a good camera if the user can figure out how to:  1.  Devise a mount that does not get water on the external wiring.  2.  How to supply a 2 amp 12 volt to the camera.  Company shows a power supply on Amazon for  $ 16.99, but does not show that the supply will power this particular camera.  It would be nice if the listing shows whether the center conductor hanging out the back is for the positive, or the negative of the power supply.  And NO, THE WIRING IS NOT UNIVERSAL.  Check this baby out before the purchase.  Like I say, It may be an absolutely great product if you are willing to take a chance on blowing the electronics.  When I use to design products like this for the end user,  I would disign them so that any voltage ( under 100 volt  ) and any polarity of connection would work without burning the guts.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$89.99", "Features": "1/3-Inch Sony Super HAD II CCD, 700 TV-Line, NTSC 976(H) x 494(V)\nVarifocal lens 2.8 ~ 12mm, Weather-rproof, 36 IR-LEDs up to 100 feet\nOn Screen Display and Wide Dynamic Range functions are built in\nAuto (White Balance, AES Function, Back Light Compensation, AGC Control, Flickerless mode)\nPower Consumption: DC12V 500mA max (IR On), Operating Temp.: -20\u00b0C ~ 50\u00b0C, A-XPWAD 500 mA Power Adapter is sold separately", "Name": "Aposonic A-CDBIV07 700 TV-Lines 2.8-12mm Varifocal lens Surveillance CCTV Weather-proof IR Bullet Camera, WDR", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/410UkrZko0L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004TLH20W"}}
