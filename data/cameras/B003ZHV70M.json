{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very interesting... NOT a gimmick!", "Author": "sam", "ReviewID": "R2U5AEM85KHV7C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying I'm not necessarily a 3d enthusiast, I wasn't all that impressed by Avatar in the theater... I'm not necessarily jumping on the 3d bandwagon because it seems to be the next big thing getting pushed by TV/display manufacturers. I am, however, a PHOTOGRAPHY enthusiast. I consider myself to be a fairly seasoned photographer -- I've got a wide variety of cameras and lenses, am members of some local photography clubs... Creative photography interests me the most. For example I have interest in things like vintage camera equipment, pinhole lenses, Lensbaby lenses, Holga cameras, etc... just all kinds of creative ways to capture things that are maybe outside of the norm.So while I think of 3d as a gimmicky trend that has been revived by the Avatar movie, I'm also a creative photographer that was very intrigued when I heard about this camera. I bought the camera sight-unseen, basically thinking it was going to be a gimmick. However after seeing the pictures it produces I honestly, truly believe it is not a gimmick and 3d photography is going to be here to stay. It may take a while to catch on, but it's here to stay.Once you experiment with the camera a bit you'll learn how to get the most of the 3d effect. Taking photos of things that are further away (such as landscapes, distant architecture/buildings where it's difficult to get a sense of depth), the effect is more subtle and less apparent. But taking photos of things that are reasonably close to you, and there are points of interest at different distances throughout the shot (such as a forest with trees at staggered distances away), the 3d effect is much more apparent and can be quite stunning. Either way, with a subtle 3d effect for things further away, or for a much more apparent 3d effect on things that are closer, it truly does add another dimension to your photography. You see things in the photos almost the way you do in real life.Like all things this is just another creative tool to add to the toolkit. There are lenses for certain jobs, and there are cameras for certain jobs. The images this camera produces really have to be seen to be believed. I, as well as several others I have shown the images to, am really shocked at how well the 3d looks and am still trying to wrap my head around it and when I might want to use this new tool.Here are my pros and cons:Pros--- - Reasonably compact for what it is. It's more compact than I expected. Have to keep in mind it is basically 2 cameras in 1. Most of the cameras I use (SLR's) are not nearly as compact as this so this really feels like a treat to carry around. - Battery life in my experience has been excellent. I've seen other reviews say the battery life isn't good. I've found that not to be the case. I didn't even fully charge the battery it came with and it's lasted for hours of me messing around and testing the camera out. - The 3d effect, when used appropriately, is really stunning. - Camera boots up reasonably quick for a compact. - Can easily switch between 2d/3d modes, can view 3d photos in 2d, etc. - Can do some creative 2d photography -- having both lenses using different settings for 1 shot.Cons--- - You have to hold the camera in a somewhat unnatural way in order to keep fingers from getting into the shots. The lenses are both on the outer sides of the front of the camera. This is a trade-off that I completely understand as they have to have the lenses apart to get the 3d effect but also wanted to keep the camera compact. - I've had poor results when using the Macro (close-up) functionality. - Not a fault of the camera, but until 3d is widely adopted it will be difficult to share these photos with anyone the way they're meant to be seen. - Prints are on the expensive side at $6.99 for a 5x7 print - Prints are only available in 5x7. I really wish there was a larger variety of sizes available. I don't expect to get gallery-sized prints, but a little bigger than 5x7 would be nice.So is the camera perfect? No. It's obviously a new technology and is only going to continue to get better. But for where it's at right now I am really thrilled with the camera overall and that's why I gave it 5 stars. This camera really does add a new dimension to photography that has sparked a creative bug inside of me that I haven't felt in a long time.* UPDATE 10/4/2010 - I've got a couple observations after having spent a few weeks with the camera, taken some video, AND I just got my first order of prints.Picture quality - I, like many other reviewers, have been \"wowed\" by the way the 3d pictures look on the camera's built in screen. I will agree with that 100%, however, being critical about the picture quality after reviewing it on a PC, it's really not that great. Don't get me wrong, the 3d effect is absolutely fabulous, but don't be fooled by the results you see on the camera's tiny display -- this is essentially 2 mediocre cameras stuffed in to 1 body. I can't say enough how cool the 3d effect is but the images on their own are on-par with about any other cheap point & shoot digital.Video - very impressive. I took some video from the top of a waterfall (looking down). Stunning.Prints - This is one area where I think a lot of other reviewers have not yet covered. I ordered 3 prints. They only come in 5x7 size. I tried to order somewhat of a variety of types of shots, just to get an idea of how they look on paper. I had no idea what to expect. Let me start by saying the prints come on a really thick paper, and it has those ridges on it -- you know, kinda like those scratchy 3d things where you can turn them to see 2 different images. Not QUITE the same, but pretty similar. Just due to the nature of the paper it is printed on a lot of the detail can be lost. So that said, I got 3 prints. Portrait - decent. Close-up shot - not good. Nature shot - awesome. The nature shot I took was from a bridge overlooking a river, with trees and such overhanging the edge of the river. The 3d effect was quite pleasing and I am excited about ordering more prints for this type of shot. Now my sample is only 3 prints, but perhaps this advice will serve someone else well. The 3d effect on the camera doesn't quite turn out the same way on a print for all types of shots.", "Date": "September 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fuji 3D Rocks! Fills the 3D content gap nicely..", "Author": "jjRobotek", "ReviewID": "R1QAFKE3RQEO0U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a long time fan of 3D and a geek, this camera was an excellent fit for me. It produces very clear, perfect 3D images with good depth. The 3.5 inch screen on the back is very High resolution (1.15 million pixels) and Displays 3D without the need for Glasses. The screen is suitable for Viewing 3D and can display a nice 3D \"pop out the screen\" effect if you compose the shot correctly. Everyone that has seen the camera's screen is amazed at the quality and 3D effect. There is nothing on the market to compare with this Fuji W3 at the moment, AIPTEK has a low end $200 3D camera and Panasonic has a $1400 3D HD video cam.This is a good addition to anyone who has a 3D HDTV or 3D projector, considering there is very little to watch in 3D at the moment. The Footage looks very good on the big screen. I am watching it on a 100\" projection Screen with Nvidia 3D vision Glasses and the effect is amazing. The Best 3D I have ever seen on the consumer market.The price tag is a little high, it still makes great sense for anyone that has invested in a 3D TV and shutter glasses. 3D and 2D may also be displayed on a TV using the built in HDMI port on the Camera (adapter required)Fuji also offers an expensive 3D printing service that will print 3D photos for about $7 per 5x7 print.Videos are recorded in resolution up to 720P in 3D or 2D. They look sharp and clear. They may be converted to work with Youtube 3D very easily using the FinePix Studio software that comes with the camera. Youtube 3D let's people watch your videos in various 3D formats, with or without glasses.I am overall very pleased with the W3Cons:1. Battery life is ~1 hour - Buy a couple spare batteries - they are as low as $4.00 on Amazon2. 3D Shooting distance should be no less than 4 feet in auto mode, anything that comes in closer than 4 feet should be small and centered, it may even pop out of the screen!3. Buy a medium - large case, the camera is a little large for a point and shoot.4. Format the memory card once you install it, I ran into issues with videos cutting off until formatted.5. 3D is not for everyone! Avoid the W3 If you cannot tolerate 3D..6. The screen must be in the center of your field of vision for the 3D effect to work.7. Video recordings cut off at 11 Minutes in HQ mode and begin a new recording. May be stitched together with software. Video Frame rate is very respectable for a flash recorder but not perfect, way better than the AIPTEK.I have some movies on youtube 3D - converted with Stereo Movie Maker, search for JJROBOTEK FUJIUse the 3D button on the player to pick your glasses format.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "1,500 pictures in...", "Author": "David Richardson", "ReviewID": "R1X2HDJB9KGRJL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I must say that I love this camera.  I followed the W1 when it first came out and was waiting for it to be offered direct to the U.S. and not be an imported item from Japan.  From what I have read the improvements are nice (but not significant - at least for what I have used).I bought this specifically to go on a trip to Civil War Battlefields and take pictures.  I got the camera a few weeks ahead of time and started taking pictures right away.  Prior to the trip I took took about 200 hundred pictures to get used to it.  During the trip I took an additional 1451, so I feel that I have a pretty good feel for its abilities.Pro's:As many have stated, the 3D ability is second to none.  I liked being able to carry it easily (I bought a small case that attaches to my belt).  The screen is large and bright and the controls are easy to learn (I have only used Canon cameras before).  It worked really well when you follow the suggestions of having your principal subject about 4-8 feet and then one or two more rows of depth behind.  I also found that it worked well when I am shooting down on something.  An image I took on the first day of a fire hydrant shot from above at a 45 degree angle is fantastic and I was just playing, but at that angle there is something all the way from top to bottom.The 3D lens is amazing.  It is so cool to show it to people.  I have not had one person that realized that I was taking 3D pictures until I showed them and all of them were just blown away with the results.  Even after 1500+ images I am still thrilled with that feature.At first my macro shots were terrible.  Others have mentioned poor results.  My desire was to try shooting my keyboard from close up.  Since it has two lenses I got a view in one image of the left keys and in the other the right side of the keyboard.  Obviously not what I wanted.  I did not think that I would be able to use it for macro work until I found the Advanced 3D option.  At first this seemed kind of pointless.  The \"advanced\" mode only shoots images from one lens (left) and then you have to manually move the camera to take the next image.  I could not believe that this was the \"advanced\" mode, the neat thing about the camera was the ability to do both lenses at the same time.  When I applied it to macro mode though it really shined.  I took a few coins and put them on the table and took an image and then moved the camera very slightly and took the next image.  Using the adjustment feature to adjust alignment I got a stunning image of coins that looks like I had giant coins made for the picture!  Since then I have done a lot of macro work and with careful attention to detail you can get amazing results.I have used the movie mode, but only on a limited basis as it is not as much fun since you can not zoom and moving around makes you dizzy in 3D.  The movie mode is good and works well for what it is, I just do not have that much experience.I have found that when you take a picture it is a good idea to press the shutter 1/2 way, the image will \"jump\" to a 3D view and you can then frame the subject easier than if you just clicked it.  Several times this has saved me from cutting off parts of my subject.I also really love the flash.  I can take a flash image and be ready for the next flash in 2-3 seconds.  My Canon is much slower between shots.2D and 3D at the same time!  When you take an image, you get both a regular JPG and a 3D (MPO) format at the same time.  While it is possible to turn this to save space on your memory card I find it invaluable to use to find a specific image (2D and 3D will have the same name with different extensions).Cons:The screen can be VERY difficult to see in bright light.  I know this would defeat the purpose of 3D, but it would be nice to have a small view finder that you could put your eye up to in addition to the screen when the light is too bright.  Many other cameras suffer from this same thing, and I have always bought ones that gave me a view finder option.  Since there is no other 3D cameras, that was not an option.Supplied Memory.  The camera does have a built in memory but it will only last for 3-4 pictures at the largest setting.  I bought a 16Gb card and have been very happy with it, but be prepared to get a card if you don't have one.  To access the memory card you need to open the battery compartment this can be a little clumsy.2D image quality.  While I purchased this solely for the 3D features I was surprised at just how poor the 2D images are.  I love the 3D feature, but would be sending it back if I purchased it for it's 2D ability.Battery.  Some love it some don't.  I think the battery is a bit under powered.  I purchased two backup batteries and often go through all of them in one day.  So far (thankfully) I have not drained all of them before I had the chance to recharge.  If you use flash a lot (and 3D images are best with a lot of light) you might want to pick up a few extras.Supplied software.  This is THE most useless piece of the Camera.  I installed it but could not get it to show me the image in 3D!  Fortunately I had Stereo Photo Maker(SPM)installed and it does wonders.  I set it as my default for MPO files and I love it.  I would recommend this free download for anyone with this camera.  There is also a Stereo Movie Maker (same source), it works well, but is tricky to install and I do not use the movie mode that much.The strap can be a problem.  While it is nice and comfortable, it is very loose around the wrist.  I actually had it slip off and drop three feet to a concrete floor (thankfully no damage).  I would like to see something similar to my Canon that has a little adjustment piece that lets you tighten the strap on your wrist after you slip you hand through.Saving/Not saving certain settings.  I took a number of pictures on a tripod (inside museums) and used the 2 second delay feature.  As soon as you take a shot it immediately disables this feature.  That means if you are taking a series of shots you need to reset the timer every time.  If you are trying to do time lapse this can be really frustrating since activating the timer bumps the camera from your desired position.  I would like the feature to be active until I change it or shut the camera down.  Certain other features stay even after you turn the camera off.  For example the flash setting stays off until you manually change it.  Nice that it did not follow the logic of the timer delay, but would have been nice if it reset when you turned the camera off.  If you turn off the 3D mode it will stay off, it is a one press of the button, so it is easy to do.  Movie mode is the same way.Dial slips. A few times I found the dial slipped from the last time I took it out of the case and started it.  This is annoying and caused a few missed shots.ASA settings can be set differently for each setting of the dial.  I found it crazy that I kept having to check what my settings were since they were not global to the camera.Along those lines, it would be nice to have a remote fire option so I don't have to bump it at all.  Wireless would be nice, but even a small cable would be fine.It is easy to put your finger in front of the lens.  This was my #1 reason for wasted shots.  Fortunately I had gotten in the habit of holding it between my index and thumb and not gripping it on the sides like most cameras by the time I left for my trip.  I did make a few mistakes, but not many.Tripod mount is off center.  Due to the placement of the battery and memory card the mount for the tripod is way off center.  I do a lot of panorama work with my 2D cameras and considered doing it with this camera, but the placement of the mount is so far off that will be very difficult.Zoom.  Forget it, this is only a 3x lens.  The 3D effect still works well at 3x, but you just can not get close enough.  I would like an 8, 10 or 12 x optical zoom. The zoom should also be able to work in movie modeLCD photo frame price.  As of this date (October 2010) the photo frame to show images in 3D is $500!  Get it to $100 and make it bigger than 8\".  Also, printing is difficult to find you have to use their \"seehere\" website and then instead of using the \"prints\" option you have to use \"photo gifts\" area to find 3D prints.  I actually had to submit a help ticket to find it.  Guess they don't sell a lot of images, just cameras.Rating:I rated this down to a 4 for two reasons:1.  The screen can be nearly impossible in bright sun.  Several shots were wasted because I could not properly frame the subject.2.  2D image quality (while not the primary use) is poor.  Since the images are essentially made of a pair of 2D images I would like the lenses to be better.  This is listed as a 10Mb camera, but if you want to use it in wide screen mode (default option) the camera will be lowered to a 7Mb image.  In the 10Mb mode it chops it off in the viewfinder (traditional 4x3 image ratio).  You think it would be 10Mb for widescreen, but its not.  When I look at the results of the left and right image seperately I notice that one is slightly out of focus with the other.  You don't notice it till you go to 100% of image size, but it becomes obvious when you have to manually align images.Bottom Line:I love the camera.  Just wish some of these things had been improved from the previous version.  While I noted many cons, I wanted to be objective and hope that some of these ideas will be in future versions.", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "The first word that comes to my mind is WOW", "Author": "Ruben Leal \"Rubnsl\"", "ReviewID": "R27MTHFNJDNURS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a fan of all that is 3D, so I Have 55 \"3D TV, games, movies, etc.. but I never imagined that I could take photos and videos in 3D, and most amazing is that everything looks 3D in the camera itself \"without glasses\", I don't know how Fujifilm make this happen but is AMAZING lol.Is amazing how much fun it is to take pictures and videos of everything you want and enjoy this amazing technology.when I pay $500 for this camera, I was a little scared by that purchase high-priced, but when I start using the camera and started taking pictures, I just said WOW so many times, I can now say that is one of my best buys I've done. if you're looking for something like this, don't even think about it, GET IT, I'm not a seller I'm a very happy costumer.And if this helps you in someway, I search on ebay, and prices are almost similar to the previous model (W1, around $500 used) so if you get bored you can sell it without losing too much (I do not think you want to sell it)just only 3 recommendations:1- buy a MINI HDMI cable for your TV 3D, because is not incluided and you'll need it to really enjoy everything in your 3D TV, I have to wait to get mine because I did not know about this.2- get an extra battery, you'll need it, trust me3- you'll need a carrying bag, you don't want this everywhere with no protection.Cons: little things but good to know, battery life is not bad but can be better (remember is not a regular camera, use more energy) and is a finger magnet (is black)I hope this will help you make your decision.", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Stunning 3D, but poor 2D pictures", "Author": "Robbert Patrison", "ReviewID": "R3U73Z2I274EEN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My great-grandfather made 3D pictures in the 1920ies. As a child I loved to look at these razor-sharp 2x2in sepia images though a wooden viewfinder. Another era came alive in front of my eyes. Almost a century later, this camera finally allows me to produce the same magic digitally. The 3D effect is stunning on the built-in 3D LCD screen, which can be viewed without special glasses.Overall, this is a well-engineered 3D camera that feels solid and looks good. Thanks to the built-in electronics, taking pictures is a breeze, though one needs to get used to the 'rules' for producing proper headache-free 3D pictures. Basically, objects should not be too close, and foreground must be centered in the picture. Also, 3D only works in landscape mode. The FinePix includes a good tutorial to get started. Though stunning, the 3D LCD viewfinder screen must be watched with some discretion, in order to avoid getting sick. Similarly, 3D movies should be panned very slowly, so that the brain can latch on to the optical illusion. If the brain misfires, this camera will literally make you puke.As much as I love the 3D effect, the 2D quality of this camera is poor. In fact, its the worst I have seen come out of digital camera ever in the past 10 years. The pictures are grainy and unsharp, especially in the edges. The camera has a few unique 2D modes thanks to the two lenses, but given the very poor quality that all doesn't matter much. Especially greens such as lawns do not sparkle and look unnatural.Given the many happy reviews and the 10MP specs of the camera, I was puzzled by the very disappointing picture quality. So I did some careful testing to get to the bottom of this, taking almost 100 pictures in various different situations and light settings. First I went to BestBuy to compare my FinePix 3D to their display model. The 2D picture quality turned out to be the same, so my camera does not have a manufacturing defect.For every picture I took with the FinePix 3D I also made a reference picture with my phone (an iPhone 4). Since the phone camera is only 5MP and has much smaller optics, one would expect better pictures from the FinePix. The opposite turned out to be the case, unfortunately. Put side-by-side on the computer monitor, the FinePix's pictures were noticeably less sharp and more grainy for both outside and inside under low-light conditions.I also compared all possible resolution, compression and ISO settings of the FinePix. Despite trying hard, I was not able to get sharper pictures out of the FinePix Real 3D. The main settings for jpg picture files are 2MP (1.3Mb size), 5MP (2.1MB), and 10 MegaPixels (4.1MB). Put side-by-side on a big monitor, it is barely possible to distinguish between the settings.A thing to consider is that 3D pictures and movies can only be watched on a (new) 3D TV, or on the built-in screen. 3D pictures are stored in an uncommon format that is not supported by most photo software. Luckily, the FinePix also stores a regular .jpg picture with the 3D one.In summary: 3D is a great gimmick and conversation piece, but the current price level and the awful 2D picture quality make it a little hard to justify. If you like to own something unique and can spare the money, the Fujifilm real 3D is for you. For most everything else, the camera in your phone is better.Update after a few months of use:The 3D pictures continue to put a smile on my face, while the poor picture quality continues to annoy. The 3D effects are hit-or-miss: it is hard to predict which pictures will come out well and which simply do not work. Sometimes a few objects in the foreground add a great perspective, while in other similar shots it does not work at all. The remedy is simply to take lots of shots and toss the ones that disappoint. Shots taken through a trees against low sunlight gave very nice effects in 3D.I also noticed that some 3D shots work better on a big 3D TV while others work better on the built-in screen. I guess it has to do with the way our eyes focus differently on a tiny screen. The only way I found to play 3D pictures on a big TV screen is by connecting the camera to the TV using an HDMI cable. This is clumsy, since the cable is shorter than the viewing distance and there is no way to group pictures. Also the camera runs on battery power, so it turns off quickly.For the 3D effects it is very important to be aware which foreground and background objects are in the shot. In bright California sunlight the viewfinder of the camera is near/totally invisible, which makes shooting quite a gamble. To salvage this, one needs to take off sunglasses and use the left hand to put a little shade on the LCD screen.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fuji W3 is awesome!", "Author": "Mal3D", "ReviewID": "R1C1HVBHYWTAQM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying I have been waiting for a camera like this ever since I first rigged my own custom digital stereo cameras in 2002.Things I like:1. It is compact. If you have ever lugged around dual camera rigs, you'll appreciate the portability of this camera. I can now take 3D pix in locations that I would never take my other rigs.2. Most of the post processing work is taken care of in the camera. No need to adjust misalignment of the left and right images. Even the parallax can be edited in the camera. Issues with images not synced, color variations, exposure differences, and focus inconsistencies between left and right images are no longer an issue.3. Fuji has updated their software to allow splitting of the 3D avi and mpo files into separate left and right files, which can then be edited and uploaded to Youtube and wherever else you would like to post. I can skip the Stereo Movie Maker step and bring the split video files straight into Sony Vegas.4. Camera doesn't stand out as much as a twinned rig. Less explaining to curious bystanders.5. The 3D display is excellent!!! I never had a preview of the stereo image before post processing. 3D was almost like the early days of digital cameras without a LCD. Framing the shot couldn't be easier. It is cool to just walk around with the camera and get a sense of the depth in different 3D compositions. I can see it being taken along with a twinned rig to frame shots, similar to taking a polaroid camera with you back in the day of film cameras.6. Anyone with a good sense of depth perception can view the 3D effect. When I do want to show an image to someone, I don't have to take out an old anaglyph image with red/blue glasses to show them. Even my mom thinks the 3D effect and images are awesome. I really never have been able to show her the images like that before.7. The styling of the camera is sleek. I like that fact that Fuji didn't try to make it colors that would stand out like a sore thumb or emblazon a huge 3D logo on the camera. Controls are intuitive and nicely placed.A few things I don't like:1.  I wish the camera lens didn't have to be open when viewing photos or uploading photos to the computer. It would also be nice to turn the sound off without disabling the flash, but those in my opinion are minor issues.2. I wish the HD video was at least 30 fps.3. I wish the camera had a hot shoe, but a lot of compact cameras do not.4. Battery life is an issue, especially if you use the powersave configuration that allows 3D preview. But I always buy extra batteries and chargers cheap on eBay. I received them the day before I got the camera and had them all charged up.5. The fixed lens separation limits the range of the 3D effect. The ability to take one image then a second image moving the camera (cha cha) with alignment preview is nice as long as the subject is stationary. But I have other more complicated rigs that allow for variable stereo base.But considering all the advantages that I see vs the minor inconveniences, I think it is the missing link in my 3D arsenal. Less technical difficulties and more production!Mal3D on MM, Flickr, and Mal3DDD on Youtube.", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Tips for better image quality for those who complained about it", "Author": "Supershopper", "ReviewID": "RH302BTX4FBDJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just had a few tips for those who complained about image quality. If you use the camera set to \"AUTO (red camera icon on wheel) you will be getting settings not optimized for the best quality. You will get ISO 800 for all pics which is very grainy not to mention smudgy in detail and you will get a lower quality setting (among other things). I used it on auto for a while and the poor quality wasn't noticeable on the small LCD camera screen, but when I went to do some 3-D printing, you could see the poor quality. So here are some tips for best image quality settings:Try the P (program) setting, then in the MENU setting, choose ISO 100 (or 200 at the very highest). Any higher and you will not be happy with the image quality especially in darker areas. I will only use ISO 100.Set the flash to AUTO or FORCED ON and try to shoot with as much light as possible if you don't like flash. Outdoors at night you will have to deal with grainy if you bump up to 400 or 800 or you will have to use a tripod.Make sure you change IMAGE QUALITY to FINE (the default is normal) and for image size choose one of the 3 proportions of the \"L\" setting (4:3, 3:2 or 16:9)Change FINEPIX COLOR to CHROME (C) The default is STD. This will bump up the saturation to more normal looking color.Making these changes will result in much better quality pictures. Images using AUTO or higher than 400 ISO will look fine on the camera display, but will look like the 1st or 2nd generation of P&S; digital cameras did (c 1999/2000) if you view them on your computer or print them for stereo viewing with an external viewer.By the way, I have an older Argus stereo camera and viewer and the viewer can be used to look at prints made using the Fuji 3D W3. There is also one just like it made by Loreo.You can DL a program like Stereo Photo Maker and you can prepare and print stereo side-by-side images from it to view with external viewers like this (file/print stereo card/size it so that the width is 152mm and crop vertically if you want a larger image).Accessories I Recommend:Get a second battery and a 32 GB card!My main review overall:I can't even describe how cool this camera is and how well it works. The creative possibilities especially with making 3D movies are endless!! I'm gonna take it over to a store with an HDMI cable where they have some 3-D TV setups now and see how they look on the big screen! I have only had it 2 days and left all the settings as default, but the quality is amazing. It's gonna be so cool taking a picture of someone with them not know what I'm doing, then turning the camera around so they can view themselves in 3-D in the viewfinder!One thing to keep in mind is that since the camera is the main and best viewer for the pics (unless you have their 8\" viewer or a 3-D TV), you will probably want to keep the images on the card rather than dumping them into the computer and clearing the card. I mean you can do this, but when you want to see them at their best, you'd have to pull them back onto the card from the computer. So get a large card so you can just archive them on it (movies and stills).You can see them on your computer monitor by opening them in Stereo Maker (free) and using the correct colored glasses (like those that come with the movie Shrek 3-D etc) And youtube handles them, but I haven't installed any of the software that comes with the camera and I think you need to do some processing in there for them to work on youtube. But they are not very colorful when you view them with the anaglyph paper glasses.The camera is a little slippery and isn't super-steady in the hands, so using the wrist-strap is a MUST so it doesn't go tumbling onto the ground. I did not have any problems with my fingers accidentally covering the lenses. But turning the power on was a mystery!! Took a while to find it in the manual - you slide the front top 1/2 of the camera down to turn it on, then slide it up to cover the lenses and turn the power off.I am sort of a 3-D buff, I still have my parents old Stereo Realist camera and bakelite viewer with the old slides they took, but now it's nice to have a digital camera that can give you more control over settings - not to mention no film developing! This is a real winner/keeper!!! If you have kids you MUST have this!!!!!!!!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the poor high ISO picture quality when viewed on a computer screen or printed.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "great quality and great fun.", "Author": "Bill", "ReviewID": "R1SSND25JL8M63", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've only had mine about a day so consider this a first impression.First off it's pretty easy to use. Menu functions are simpler than I expected. It was faster to jump in and start poking around the menus than to try and read the manual first. When I had a question is when I referred to the manual. Even then, the quick start manual provided will often refer you to the full users manual which comes on the CD provided. Not good when your out in the field(where else are you likely to be?).The quality of the display is astonishing. I went around the office this morning taking pictures of co-workers and even the ludites were impressed. I took a couple dozen shots inside our office most with the lights off and this camera takes great low light pictures.Video wasn't quite as good. The PQ was ok but the video was kind of jerky. It didn't seem to be recording at full 24fps. It should work better on a tripod recording subjects moving and avoiding fast pans.After a little trial and error I was able to view pics and video on my Mitsubishi 65C9 by connecting it to the mits 3DA-1 converter(same as you would do with any other, non-checkerboard, 3D source). I set the camera to display side by side. I also used a mini HDMI cable(not supplied)I had lying around. I doubt it was ver. 1.4 as recommended but I wasn't connecting to a 1.4 TV like most of the new LCD, LED or Plasma 3DTV's.I didn't really like the way they designed the aux. power supply which is a proprietary device(not included)shaped like the battery that slide in place of the battery and requires you to flip open a little access flap to allow the wire to exit the camera when the battery compartment door is closed. On the other hand I rarely have need for auxiraly power but someone (a professional perhaps) might want this for studio work.All in all I really love this camera for most of the usual 2D merits and, of course, for the very good 3D functionality.", "Date": "September 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Fujifilm 3D W3 camera exceeds all my expectations!", "Author": "Rotwang", "ReviewID": "R2OK1D7UFWJWUU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "During the 3-D movie boom of the nineteen fifties, 3-D cameras became very popular with the public and I'm not sure why that hasn't happened again during the current 3-D movie boom, because the 3-D technology is much better today.  Perhaps, it's because 3-D TV sets have not caught on and the best way to view 3-D photos and watch 3-D video is on a big screen 3-D TV in high definition.  Whatever the reason for the public's lack of interest in personal 3-D photography today, the slow sales of 3-D cameras has driven down prices and made it possible for almost anyone to afford the excellent Fujifilm Finepix Real 3D W3 camera.  I've only had my camera for one day, but it already exceeds my expectations. I've been taking stereo pictures for sixty years with a Stereo Realist camera, which was the best 3-D camera of it's day. But, in my opinion, the Fujifilm 3-D camera is by far the best 3-D camera I've ever owned.  This is a sophisticated camera with many advanced features that will take time to learn, but it's possible to take very good 3-D snapshots right out of the box using the factory default settings.  The camera is surprisingly compact for a 3-D camera and it has both manual and automatic 3-D parallax adjustment and optical zoom.I resisted buying a digital 3-D camera until recently, because every 3-D camera I looked at had the lenses set too close together to get true stereo 3-D.  The centers of the camera lenses should be around 70 millimeters apart when photographing most subjects in stereo 3-D, because that is the separation of the pupils of most adult men. The Fujifilm 3D camera's lens separation is very close to the ideal separation.  The other 3-D cameras I looked at had the lenses located much too close together for true stereo at normal distances.  Apparently, the rationalization for this is to avoid eyestrain in macro photography.  But how often does a person do macro photography compared to normal family and landscape photography. While not designed for true macro shots, the Fujifilm 3D camera does include a parallax adjustment for 3-D close-ups of people and objects of normal size, plus a multiple exposure method for taking macro 3-D and 3-D long shots. Why spoil the 3-D effect in 98 percent of your pictures for that 2 percent of the time when you want to get right on top of a flower or a bug. Unless most of your pictures are extreme close-ups of bugs and flowers, then the Fujifilm 3D W3 camera is the best 3-D camera to buy.I read some negative reviews of this camera on Amazon before I bought it, so I was prepared to deal with problems when the camera arrived.  I read that some people had to update the firmware, while others complained about poor image quality. I'm pleased to report that I didn't experience any of those problems.  I got beautiful, sharp 3-D pictures with the factory default settings. One negative review I read was about the poor quality of 2-D pictures taken with this camera, but I didn't buy a 3-D camera to take 2-D pictures, so I can't comment on that.  I have a standard digital camera if I want to take 2-D pictures.  The camera default takes a duplicate 2-D picture with each 3-D picture and the only change I made to the camera settings was to turn that feature off, because I don't want to waste SD card space on duplicate pictures in 2-D. If you need a 2-D image at a later time, you can always separate one image from the stereo pair.As for the reviews that complain about the need to update software, that may have only been true of cameras purchased a long time ago, but it didn't apply to my camera. The only update I found on the Fujifilm web site was designed to reduce the quality of 3-D movies to extend the running time on low capacity SD cards.  That seems unnecessary to me given the drop in the price of high capacity SD cards. 3-D video does take up a lot of space in a hurry, so if you plan to record 3-D video for more than a few minutes at a time buy 16 GB class 10 SD cards. But, those SD cards are now available for less than $20, so I see no need for the update. The editing and processing software that came on the disk with my camera had a self-updating feature, but I used it before and after I ran the update and I couldn't tell any difference.The 3-D lenticular viewfinder on the back of the camera is amazing. I can see the picture I'm going to take in 3-D right there on the camera and also play it back later on the viewfinder in 3-D.  The only complaint I have about the camera is that the viewfinder can be difficult to see in bright sunlight.  The camera does have a way to turn the viewfinder brightness up, but a flip-up cover for the viewfinder screen would not only protect the screen, but might provide some shade from direct sunlight.The real thrill for me was seeing my photos and movies come to life on my 60 inch 3-D HDTV, it is absolutely spectacular.  For those who don't yet have a 3-D TV, the Fujifilm 3D camera's pictures can also be displayed in the anaglyph system, so your photos can be viewed in 3-D on a non 3-D TV with red/cyan glasses.  However, this 3-D method is inferior and should not be used if you have a 3-D TV. There are several different ways to view still pictures in 3-D on a 3-D TV.  I took the SD card out of the camera and plugged it directly into the TV and watched a slide show of my still pictures in 3-D on the TV. It was that easy.  If your TV has a USB socket, but does not have an SD slot, then just move the pictures to a USB thumb drive or put the SD card into an SD to USB adapter.Unlike still 3-D photographs, 3-D movies may require conversion before you can display them on a 3DTV if you use the SD card from the camera.  This depends on the 3DTV, but not all 3DTV sets will accept the AVI format of the camera on an SD card, so the format may have to be converted to the WMV side-by-side format. If you need to change the 3-D format, the \"MyFinePix Studio\" software that comes with the camera (on a disk) can perform this conversion.  After starting the software and selecting the movie you want to process, select \"3D Tool Palette\" and then start \"3D Movie Trimming\". You can trim the file, but you don't have to.  Now, save the file in the \"WMV (side by side/ for 3D TV)\" format if you have a 3-3DTV.  You can save the file to an SD card, a USB thumb drive, or burn the file to a DVD.  If you decide to put the video on a DVD then be sure to burn the disk in DVD mode and finalize the disk, or it may not display in 3-D on your 3DTV. When you watch the WMV 3D movies on your 3DTV, select the side-by-side display option from the 3D menu on the 3DTV and the movie will show in 3-D with the glasses that came with your 3DTV. If you burn the converted files to a DVD disk then you can play them in any ordinary DVD player and they will come out in 3-D on the TV, because this is not the same format used on 3D Blu-ray disks.You can also use the supplied software to convert the video to the 3-D anaglyph format for viewing on a non 3-D TV by selecting the \"WMV (Anaglyph red/blue)\" option in the \"3D Tool Palette.  In this case you'll have to supply your own red/blue glasses and be sure the red lens of the glasses is over your left eye, or you'll get inverted 3-D.  Also, if you plan to shoot anaglyphs, I recommend setting the camera on the black and white option, because color anaglyphs look horrible.  When viewing your 3-D pictures on a non 3-D computer screen with the supplied software, the image will default to the anaglyph mode, so you'll need some red/cyan glasses. The glasses are not included with the camera, but any red/cyan glasses you have around the house will work. Be sure to flip the glasses around to avoid inverted 3-D if necessary.Burning your 3-D photos and movies to a DVD provides an inexpensive way to archive your 3-D photos and movies as well as providing a simple and convenient way to watch them.  And, if you decide to burn everything to 3-D DVDs, you can save money by erasing and reusing the same SD cards in the camera over and over.  However, you will have to convert the files before you burn them to a DVD and the 3-D image on the DVD will not be in high definition, so it will not look as clear and sharp as watching the video with an HDMI cable by the method explained below.Converting 3-D movies with the supplied software is very time consuming. If you don't want to bother to convert the movie files, then you can use an HDMI cable to watch 3-D movies on your 3DTV directly from the camera and this has the advantage of displaying the images in High Definition. This cable does not come with the camera, so you'll need to buy the cable. You can't use a standard HDMI cable that connects a 3-D Blu-ray player to a 3-D HDTV, you'll need a male HDMI to mini-male HDMI cable to connect the camera to a TV.  Unless you can find this special cable in a twelve foot length, then you'll be forced to run the camera in automatic slide show mode.  I bought a six foot HDMI cable that put me too close to my 60 inch screen for comfortable 3-D viewing, so I'm unable to advance the pictures with the controls on the camera.  Until I get a longer HDMI cable with a mini HDMI connector on one end, then I'll have to continue to use the slide show feature of the camera.  This is the only drawback I've found to using a cable over storing the images on SD cards or DVDs where the slide show can be controlled with a TV or DVD player remote.One of the big complaints in the reviews I read on Amazon had to do with the way the camera is held, which takes some getting used to for most people. The Fujifilm engineers apparently studied the Stereo Realist camera and adopted the way the Realist camera is held.  The Realist camera was very innovative in it's time and there is an important reason to hold a 3-D camera the way the Realist camera was designed to be held.  2-D cameras don't have to be level, but 3-D cameras can produce eyestrain if the camera is not held level. This is because it's difficult for the brain to fuse stereo images taken by a stereo camera that is not horizontal.  The best way to hold a 3-D camera is to rest the bottom of the camera on both thumbs, because this helps insure that the camera is level. Pressing the Fujifilm 3D camera's shutter is a two step process.  Push the shutter button down half way and hold it while the camera makes exposure adjustments, parallax adjustments, and focuses the lenses (you can see this happen in the viewfinder).  Then, press the shutter button down the rest of the way to take the picture.  Failure to hold the button at the half way position long enough for the camera to focus while adjusting the exposure and parallax may be the reason why some people don't get good pictures with this camera. There is a setting that speeds up the automatic focusing and parallax process, but this reduces battery life, so the camera default is the slower setting.The other big complaint in the reviews was that holding the camera this way caused one's fingers to end up in front of the lenses and this is a valid point. This unique way of holding a camera works well with the Realist, camera, because the Realist is much bigger.  The Fujifilm camera is very compact compared to the Realist camera and I have to admit that it is a challenge to keep one's fingers away from the lenses.  Looking for your fingers on the viewfinder screen helps, but a finger is hard to see if it only partially covers one lens. This way of holding a camera does take time to get used to. The integrated lens cover is another idea that was adapted from the Stereo Realist camera.I'm used to holding the camera this strange way, because I bought a Stereo Realist 3-D camera in 1953. I saved money from my paper route for a year to buy that camera for $159.  Adjusting for inflation, the Realist camera would cost over $2000 in today's money.  Plus, the Realist camera required a stereo hand viewer, which had to be purchased separately for another $25 in 1953 dollars.  And then there was the cost of color slide film, film developing and stereo slide mounting. I bought the Fujifilm 3D W3 camera on amazon for $171, only $12 dollars more than I paid for my first 3-D camera sixty years ago.  In terms of purchasing power, the Fujifilm 3-D camera was less than one tenth the cost of the Realist camera and the Realist could only take simple snapshots.  The Fujifilm 3-D camera can also take sound movies in 3-D, not to mention that the Realist camera was much more difficult to operate. I had to set the lens opening (F-stop)and shutter speed on the Realist manually and then focus every picture.  Anyone who finds fault with the Fujifilm 3-D camera which can do everything automatically (or manually) should try to take pictures with a Stereo Realist camera.  It is unfortunate that the public has not embraced digital stereo photography and for that reason Fujifilm is probably selling this wonderful 3-D camera for less than it cost to make.  On the other hand, if you're like me and find stereo photography to be magical, then you can get one hell of a great bargain on this camera.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Little Thing", "Author": "Soulster", "ReviewID": "R1WZ33CC845TPB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a long time stereoscopic photography enthusiast who has been waiting decades for a modern 3D camera - one that incorporates even basic technology such as autofocus or even autoexposure. There has not been a single one for ages. Then out of the blue pops Fujifilm with this masterpiece!Considering what it holds, this is a surprisingly sleek package. It is the size of an average point and shooter, only about 1/2 an inch wider.The screen is huge, bright and clear. A bit harder to view out in the sun though.It is a bit of a smudge magnet - screen especially.It initially takes practice not to cover the right lens with your finger. I put my fingers into it a couple of times (Make sure you research how to do so before you attempt to clean a delicate camera lens).The flash can be a bit weak.Takes longer to find focus indoors. Several pics, especially when taken by guests, have been out of focus.When scrolling through pictures, what it shows at first looks slightly out of focus, then sharpens after a fraction of a second.Not everyone sees the 3D. People who require strong specs seem to have the most trouble. There are simple online tests you can use to check your 3D vision.Gas guzzler: It is barely okay for taking a night of party shots, but you definitely want to carry a backup battery or two for extended work. You also tend to review and show off the shots a lot more.The camera does not lag on you. It will take the shot if you insist, regardless of whether the flash/focus is ready or not.When focusing on your shot the previewing switches to 3D - very neat.The 3D pictures are amazing and breathtaking. Plenty of ahs and gasps from people as soon as they see the pics. It has even spooked more than one person. Average for 2D.. but why would you want to go there :-) ? Anyway, buy this camera primarily for its 3D abilities, not its (acceptable) 2D performance.The ideal viewing medium is a 3D HDTV. Lets put the state of 3D TV tech into perspective: 3D technology is kind of like electric power for automobiles. Just like we want an electric car that we can charge in 60 seconds and drive for 400 miles, we also want glasses-free technology for our 3D TVs. Problem is the enabling technology is just not there. If you can live within the limits of current technology, however, they are fantastic.If you don't mind using your camera as the primary viewer, its glasses-free experience is out of this world! You will not find yourself thinking that the technology is not mature. It is magical, like something out of Star Trek!I am honestly surprised that this camera is as cheap as it is. It is way more than simply two cameras stuck together. First of all this is a very niche camera that is not going to sell in millions to cover its hefty development price tag. Fujifilm has had to design dedicated technology and processors for this camera it cannot use elseware its range to spread the cost.  The camera also uses a unique large, very high quality, and undoubtedly expensive lenticular lcd screen. The slight lag in the resolution of pictures during preview? Understandable when you consider it has 20 megapixels to chew. The short battey life? That is reasonable considering it is basically two cameras in one. That is in addition to the 3D processing overhead - kinda like a 4x4 of cameras. To keep the camera sleek the battery had to be kept small. From my use I'd say they made a great compromise.This camera is a great complement to your 3D HDTV. No copying of files or any complicated setup business - just hook it up with a HDMI cable and play. If you have a 3D HDTV, get this camera! You can also view your 3D pictures with cheap viewers for use with standard computer monitor screens (Search Loreo).Finding a suitable case took some research. The one I settled on is the Caselogic TBC 303 Camera/Camcorder case. It is only slightly larger than the camera, has a belt loop and a zip pocket that can hold a couple of spare batteries. Fujifilm has just released a dedicated belt pouch.For storage I am using a Transcend 8GB class 10 SDHC card which has worked flawlessly for recording 3D HD Video. The pics and video take up far more storage than usual so make sure you buy a card with adequate writing speed and capacity.This camera literally has no competition on the market. No other company offers such a product, which is why I am amazed Fujifilm bothered to do such a thorough job. Well done, Fuji. Buy without reservation!** Update 12/13/2011 **Lost my first one and bought a replacement. It came with a euro plug on charger. You can remove this euro plug to expose the us plug.Buy a screen protector - the screen scratches very easily!

I'm still learning the ropes but so far, it's been nothing short of impressive.It may seem pricey but keep in mind, this is like 2 high-powered cameras in one device designed specifically for stereoscopic 3D. Controls like the auto-parallax more than justify the price. The 3D monitor is amazing and instantly gratifying especially when your 3D shots come out looking amazing. And if the novelty of 3D runs out for you, the 2D shooting features will keep you happy. Shooting with two different cameras gives you more options for creative photography. Bear in mind, unlike what the marketing images suggest, it's not the exact shot (obviously since the lens are spaced apart) and in some cases, it's not the exact moment.The reason why this doesn't get 5 stars is because of some of the inconveniences I've run into. For example, the bundled software is terrible for this camera. On that note, Mac users will find the lack of support and software to be a pain.

I bought this camera because while I work with stereo footage all day, I thought it would be fun to play with footage I shot myself.And it is!  This is a really nice way to jump into stereographic photography.  The results are fun to flip through and turn a lot of heads at parties/etc.Pros:- IA (lens separation) is fairly high, as compared to some other models, so your shots will tend to have a lot of steregraphic volume and thus will feel more dynamic- Interface is fairly intuitive as far as point-and-shoot cameras go (but don't expect the fine-tuning you'd get with a real DSLR)- The display is nice and large, and the 3d looks great (when viewing from the very finnicky angle where it looks right).Cons:- IA is large enough that if you shoot anything closer to the camera than about 3 feet, the results are almost unwatchable (too much volume)- This is a point-and-shoot, you don't get much in the way of control of your images beyond a few ISO settings, flash on or off, etc.- As with any stereographic photography, there are slight vertical alignments which will make your results (if viewed on a larger screen or for a long period) difficult to look at.  In my job we spend quite a lot of energy getting rid of these vertical disparities so the movies don't hurt to look at.- Similar to the above, get ready for color differences between the left and right eyes, which can cause similar headaches over long periods.  In both of these cases, there are post-processing options which can make your results look much better.- It's extremely easy to end up shooting images with your finger or thumb covering one of the lenses -- which essentially makes your photographs unwatchable.  I don't know how they could prevent that, it's just the natural way you'd hold a camera if you were used to the lens being close to the center.- No options to shoot in raw.  If you're shooting 3d photos, then you're shooting in .mpo format which is apparently just two jpgs written into a single file.- The on-axis flash not only flattens lighting but creates dark lines of shadow around the layers of depth in your subject (since it's between the two lenses).  Ideally there would be a way to trigger a different flash unit with the camera instead, but I'm not sure if this could be an option here.- There's a dedicated lever for convergence control (top left) but it's the only part of the camera with shoddy construction, and if you change the convergence on a photo when reviewing, the camera won't remember that offset so you'll have to redo it the next time you're viewing the photo.Despite this cons list being fairly long, I'm really happy with the purchase.  Of course I'm sounding picky here (it's my job), but I think it's good as this field opens up to educate users and manufacturers with how consumer-grade stereographic photography has a ways to go.I strongly endorse the camera and can't wait to shoot more!

During that time I've used many different stereo cameras and I have a colledtion of about 50 stereo cameras from the 40s onwards, in 35mm, 16mm and 620 formats.  I was a group leader of the Stereoscopic Society, a member of the 3D Society, and one of the founder members of Internation Stereoscopic Union.  I have also shot many hours of stereoscopic movies using a Bolex H16 16mm camera and the Bolex Stereo Attachment.  So you can see that I know what I'm talking about.What I wanted from a camera was one capable of taking digital stereo pairs, preferably in widescreen format, of the quality that I could get with a 35mm stereo camera, and this camera does just that.  It's one of the few digital stereo cameras which has an inter-lens separation similar to one's interocular separation, and that makes all the difference.  Most of the other digital stereo cameras have a much smaller separation, creating hypostereo, which is the effect of looking at an image the way an animal with much smaller interocular separation, such as a cat, would see the object.  Adverts will tell you that a smaller separation helps with close-ups, but don't believe it.  If you want to use a different inter-lens separation this camera allows you to do it, by taking left and right images separately if you want to.  Of course, you have to make sure that nothing moves between exposures.This camera takes a stereo pair and a regular .jpg image simultaneously, which means you don't have to carry two cameras around for that occasional 2D shot.  Just shoot away and you have both formats available.I cannot say too much about this camera.  It does everything that I want of it.

On the trip I learned quite a few things about it.First, if you compose the right shot, the pictures can look amazing !That being said, here are some considerations:You are really limited to horizontal shots, verticals don't show the 3D as well.The lenses are not very wide angle, so the subject needs to be a few feet away (this is actually a good thing, as very close subjects are seen drastically different by the two lenses and create a VERY disturbing image (like crossing your eyes), closest subject needs to be around 3-5 feet away).The lenses do not work well in low light, focus will hunt and you really loose the 3D effect.Ok, sounds limiting, but if you have a horizontal, daylight shot (preferably with at least three elements; one close 3-6 foot range and another element farther back and optimally a background element, you can take an image that no one will believe, Simply amazing!You will be surprised how easy it is to compose a shot like that, I took many great pictures on the trip (no prints back from Fuji's \"SeeHere\" printing service yet so can't comment on that). You just have to be aware of your composition, and take advantage of the depth that this camera can capture that most photographers dismiss as most cameras \"just can't do it justice\" type shots, that is where this camera excels.Ok a few footnotes, the battery is pretty good considering how hard it is working (essentially running two cameras), but make sure you charge up often as once the battery indicator starts flashing you don't have many shots left. Boot up time is pretty good, actually faster than a Nikon point and shoot I had so very pleased with that. Shots record quickly (I was using a class 10 SD card), and the camera can record a 2D .jpg with the same file name as each 3D shot, so you can see on a regular PC roughly what the 3D file contains (and the .jpg is a from one of the lenses and so is a full res good 2D picture on it's own and can be used when the 3D is not needed). The Advanced 2D modes like simultaneous wide/zoom, I think are only marginally useful, I might use it in a niche situation but really don't see using these features much. And finally, 3D movies (when composed correctly) were also good. I took only this camera and a Canon G11 and was able to capture the entire trip and always felt like I had the right camera for the job. Both were pocktable and so I really did not feel like a tourist and yet had some really great pictures from the trip. I will follow up when I get prints back.UPDATE 1/10/11 : Ok, so I got the 3D prints back from SeeHere.com. First the good news, service is great, even though ordering can be a pain, the prints were done and shipped the same day I entered the order and they were shipped FEDEX and received only a few days later. Sadly, the bad news is the prints themselves. I chose the best 2 pictures from over a hundrend that I took while in NY and these looked FANTASTIC on the camera, the prints unfortunately, are novelty at best. Even from a casual glance you notice they are blurry in the background unless you look at them from an angle, and then only the close side becomes clear and the other side is still blurry. Color is almost completly washed out, and as for resolution on the print, I could get a 10 year old Nokia phone to take a better picture!Now, don't fault the camera here, as I have printed many of the 2D jpgs and they look good, I think the problem comes from the printing on \"lenticular paper\". They way the image has to be chopped up to give you the illusion of 3D means much of the data that makes a good picture is missing. Color saturation is the first thing I noticed missing, and resolution is way down from the 2D prints.Finally, I may have just printed some bad choices, but I have a feeling we are just not ready for glasses free 3D prints yet, my other experience with the 3D from this camera have been exceptional, and I will still show these prints around to friends as a conversation piece, but they won't be framed and hanging on a wall anytime soon..Great camera, ahead of it's time, 3D prints, not ready for prime time.Update #2 1/11/11 : After passing the prints around the office we found one interesting tidbit, the images seem to have the same restraint as the camera when taking pictures, in that the subject should be some distance away for best results. When the prints were held at arms length or farther, they seem to pop into focus a bit and the 3D became clearer and more pronounced, the loss of resolution was also less noticeable from a distance. Seems the prints may be ok, if you can deal with not scrutinizing them too closely.RGUARD", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "So far - I'm loving it !", "Author": "John Hillestad", "ReviewID": "R3SHYVVBKDR1G1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you have a new 3D TV this maybe the sweetest add on for it !

When I watch my pictures its like I made my own viewfinder pics! My outdoor pictures really looked great , indoor shots can be more tricky because I dont like to use flash. The camera can take 3D and normal jpg's at the same time so if your concerned about using a shot - you can also use software to split the mpo into the right and left jpegs so you really never need to worry about having unusable pics that are 3D only.....The camera also takes 3D avi's but you need the camera hooked to the tv to play it back.... If you have a PS3 I believe it can play back mpo pictures in 3D as well hopefully 3D-avi files will be adapted soon as well.

I've used it for a few weeks now, and here are my impressions:Quality-wise it of course can't compare to a DSLR. But that's to be expected. It does fine in situations that aren't too difficult, and actually does a pretty good job inside buildings.For a seasoned photographer, this has all the defects of a point and shoot camera: slow startup, low quality, no RAW, and no useful depth of field effects. On the upside, in 3D I don't think bokeh is all that necessary. The 3D effect itself works for separating background from foreground, though that of course doesn't help blur anything undesirable that might be there.That said, it's impressively well thought. I can see Fuji actually did some thinking with modes like the manual 2D for closeups, and simultaneous flash/no flash and wide/narrow modes, as well as the provision for external power.The 3D effect is great, and it takes perfect 3D photos and videos. Video on my monitor (Zalman 3D) looks as if I was looking at the scene through a hole. Seriously impressive.Uses the MPO image format, which is standarized and seems to be getting adopted by other devices. Very nice to see.Now the problems:Battery life sucks. Get a second, and maybe a third battery. If doing video, don't expect more than 30 minutes or so of it per battery.Video is limited to 11 minutes in a row. Most cheap cameras are the same, but it's a pity and quite limiting. Would love to see a version without this limit.Video is in MJPEG format. Which is nice for editing, but is a huge, huge disk space hog. This thing goes through 32GB cards with gusto. Make sure to get at least one if you plan to do video.It's very, very easy to accidentally get a finger right in front of one of the lenses. Makes for somewhat awkward holding. Not a huge defect, but annoying and can be hard to notice at times, as it usually only happens to one of the lenses, which may make it invisible on the screen if looking from the wrong angle.Quality of the 3D printing leaves a lot to be desired. Some lenticular prints I got for comparison have a lot more depth. Not sure yet if it's me or the service though. For display, you definitely want to have a 3D monitor/TV/photo frame, it will look a LOT better.Screen sucks in bright light. Pretty normal for a compact camera, really. Otherwise, the screen is very good, with an excellent 3D display.Youtube unfortunately doesn't accept the camera's video as is, and requires conversion. Not the camera's fault, which uses a perfectly sensible format. But still a minor inconvenience. Hope Google fixes it.Conclusion: It has its problems, but none are critical, and it makes for a most excellent start.

Kudos to them for blazing this new ground alone.  This 2nd gen W3 camera is a huge improvement over the W1 but still needs some work to be functionally better.  Pair this camera with a 3D TV or you're missing out on most of the enjoyment of the full 3D experience.  If you ever looked into a 3D ViewMaster and said \"Wow,\" buy this camera and never look back.The Good:1) 3D images!2) Plenty of pixels.  In fact too many pixels.  All you need is 1920 x 1080.3) Large rear 3D screen for viewing without 3D glasses. Quite impressive.4) Uses standard SD memory cards that also work in my Nikon, not proprietary or odd like xD was.5) Plenty of built-in and user adaptable settings.6) If you understand ISO settings you know that the lower the ISO the better for HQ images and this camera can do it (@ISO 100).  Higher ISO settings = grainier images. Its a trade-off.  Don't complain that the camera can't take good pictures if you don't understand how to use it.7)  Solid quality build.  Thick metal lens cover.  Not plasticky.The Bad:1)  Macro is unusable with the present lens configuration.  Each lens is so close to the subject in Macro mode that it sees a completely different area that may not even overlap at all for 3D.2)  Don't zoom in on anything close either for the same reason.  Zooming in on distant objects is okay.3)  The lenses don't converge (angle inward like your eyes would) for close-in shots.  This explains #1 and #2.  There is an auto/manual convergence setting in the camera which works for subjects >4 ft away which basically just changes the overlap between the images and is not a true convergence adjustment.  If the lenses on this little gem would pivot inward as you focus closer they would have a dream 3D closeup camera too.3)  Included software is not like using Photoshop.  Nuff said.  Hey, its free.  If you are geeky enough you'll find free or cheap equivalents on the web for now.  Or simply do like me and punt it for now.  Eventually we will be rescued with a Photoshop plugin.4)  Silent mode is not just silent; it also turns off the flash.  This one had me baffled at first because the flash wouldn't fire.  They should call it stealth mode instead.  To turn off the tinkly, obtrusive sounds simpy go into the menu and turn the volume to zero for each one instead.User hints:1)  Crop in your viewfinder because later (software) is not easy.  You won't do it.2)  Use 1920x1080 image size because of #1.  You can only see HD video size on a 3D TV anyway.  Forget saving big file sizes for printing like we normally do.  Fuji's printing service is $$$ and is mostly a novelty for now. Let's face it, 3D photos are not for printing on a 2D sheet of paper.3)  Take advantage of the user configurable controls to speed usage.4)  Best 3D shots are with multiple subjects between 4 and 20 ft away.  The more subjects at different distances within this range the resulting image will look more 3D like.4) Buy a 3D TV at the same time.  If you are unsure, just take your 3D photos on a USB memory stick (or your memory card and USB reader and USB cable) into your local TV store and plug it into a new model 3D TV (like LG), put on the 3D glasses, step back 12 feet and observe.

I like the cover slide on/off switch, but I would like to have the ability to view photos/videos with the lens cover up. Not a big deal though.I went and took some pictures around my area, to check out the picture quality, and more importantly, how 3D that does not require glasses would actually look. I was impressed, and as an early adopter and techno-geek, it takes much for a technology to impress me. The photos on the LCD display did appear fully 3D. It looked as if I could reach in and grab the stuff. Foreground objects really did appear out of the screen. Of course it was all effects generated by the 3D LCD technology, but, still, very impressive. I also took some short videos while riding around, and it looked the same as if I were peering out a window. What surprised me the most is how much leeway is available for the \"sweetspot\". I was expecting to need a very narrow window to see the 3D effect, but instead the viewing windows was quite flexible.In case any readers are looking forward to the Nintendo 3DS, this display is the same technology that the 3DS is going to use, so I am really anticipating this portable.Still, not everything is perfect about this camera. As it is a new technology, there are limited options to view images in 3D. Aside from the camera itself, Fujifilm offers an 8 inch 3D LCD digital picture frame, as well as a printing service that prints photos on 3D paper (works similar to the 3D LCD display). Video of course can be viewed on 3D TV via a separately sold HDMI cable. Bundle applications is sparse, but given this is an emerging technology, I expected that.Over all, this is a great camera.

Download the freeware StereoPhoto Maker by Suto & Sykes (just search for it online), and you can split .MPO files (the native file type of 3D photos) into left and right .jpg images, color correct, crop, create red-blue and optimized anaglyphs, and so forth to your heart's content.  It beats the bloated Fuji software that comes with the camera, in my mind.For the totally new, 3D photography basically consists of taking two separate pictures, and viewing the left picture with the left eye and the right picture with the right eye.  The slight difference in angle between the two pictures creates depth when the brain combines the two images into one.To show each eye a different picture, this camera uses a (really great) lenticular screen on the back.  The screen is probably the greatest thing about the camera, as it's razor sharp, bright, and a lot of fun at parties.  Really nice 3D effect.When you don't have a lenticular screen for viewing pictures, there are other ways to display them - the easiest being red/blue anaglyphs for viewing with red/blue glasses (which can be found online cheaply).  I print out anaglyphs, frame them, and give them to people with a cardboard pair of 20-cent 3D glasses.Image quality seems good if you keep ISO below 400.  The flash is weak, so make sure that your subjects are well-lit, especially indoors.  The lenticular display can be deceiving as it tends to make bad shots look better - only when you transfer to your computer do you notice the grain and soft focus of higher ISO/weak flash shots.3D photography requires a little more thought when it comes to composing a shot. You have to be about 5 feet away.  There shouldn't be an object or a wall half-off the screen in the foreground.  It takes a little more time than just pointing and shooting, but the results are worth it, for sure.Now... the thing that I hate, Hate, HATE about this camera: The video quality is terrible.  720P HD that it may be, I have a mini DV camera from 2002 that takes sharper, better digital video.  Footage looks like a college dorm laptop webcam if you blow it up to television-size.  On the back-of-the-cam lenticular, and on Youtube, it looks good, but don't plan to enter a film contest with this.  Control over video via the menu screen is nonexistent - you can't control shutter speed, aperture, or anything. Point and shoot.To be technical, 3D video is taken at 24 frames/second, and even when deinterlaced with Cineform NeoScene remains blurry, soft and strobed when expanded to over 10 inches diagonal.  I edit with the latest incarnation of Sony Vegas Movie Studio, but nothing can salvage bad out-of-the-camera footage.  Definitely don't buy this if you're seeking a 24p camera.  Don't buy this as a pocket camcorder for family memories, either.  The video quality just isn't worth it.2D video is 30 frames per second, but hardly better in quality.  Again, detail is soft, grainy, and subject to a lot of color bleeding.  Bright light helps, but only marginally.If you want to take more than 20 seconds of video at a time, the camera requres a SDHC memory card rated at a speed of 6 or higher (look on the card for a small letter \"C\" with a number in the middle, and make sure that that number is at least 6).In summary, I purchased this to experiment with 3D video, but have found it to be more effective - and quite fun - as a still camera that works best in bright light at low ISO settings.  On a final note, color is just fine, but experiment with black and white shots, for sure - I feel that these are some of the best-looking pictures this camera takes - especially for creating anaglyphs.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent and Easy Digital 3-D is here", "Author": "Stereo3D", "ReviewID": "R3PJPCMGNUCA0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off I love this camera. It does a great job of taking 3-D images including 3-D video! Viewing the images on a 3-D TV are breathtaking.Everyone who I have shown the camera to is amazed. The built-in 3-D monitor on the back of the camera literally freaks them out every time I show them the 3-D image. One note: Buy extra batteries! You'll be glad you have a the extra power. The camera battery usually runs down after shooting a few hundred shots because you most often share the images with people on the monitor and that uses a lot of power consumption.For those who are not 3-D savvy, you will make your life much easier when converting the *.mpo files to anaglyphs or side by side 3-D if you download a free piece of software that does not come with the camera software disk.  The software is called STEREO PHOTO MAKER. ([...]) It is extremely easy to use and you can even batch convert an entire folder of photos to the format you want with just a few clicks.Fujifilm can improve the camera in the following ways.1. Make the shutter take the image exactly when you push the button. There is a slight delay in taking the picture and you sometimes miss the shot you want because the shutter takes a second to fire.2. I have noticed a few light flares (usually a round orb) on several shots. There may be no way to avoid this unless the lenses are shaded more somehow.3. I would like to see is a way to edit the 3-D video into a series (produce my own 3-D feature using 3-D clips) and output it to a stereo *.avi file that plays on a 3-D TV. Maybe that is possible but I have yet to find that option or figure out how to do it using my existing software (Adobe Premiere, etc.) Add the ability to edit 3-D video clips together on a timeline.4. Lastly, bring down the price of the accessory 3-D picture frame. It costs twice what the camera costs. Surely you would sell more of them by offering them at a more affordable price.Thanks to Fujifilm for making this camera available to stereo enthusiasts!

The 3D effect works up to about 3/4 zoom (at max zoom, there's not enough parallax for 3D, so it's understandable - your eyes wouldn't work, either).* A sliding lens cover makes this great to put in a pocket, without fear of messing up the lenses.* The camera has a physically sturdy build. It doesn't feel cheap at all.* It has a flash, not some dumb LED.* The screen will - speaking loosely - make you trip balls. It's like nothing I've ever seen before, with that no-glasses 3D effect.

But seriously image quality should have been better.- No whitebalance options in movie mode.There are other cons but i can live with those- No zoom in movie recording.- Non standard video format, or maybe its Youtube, But you can not upload video files directly to YouTube as 3D. But there is a workaround, you can  upload using their software (latest update) which does some conversion which works pretty well. But its an additional step.-Latest fuji software lets you stitch clips together which is handy, but you have to do it 2 clips at a time. You cannot stitch say 10 clips make a movie and upload to youtube. You would have to do it in another movie editor like Magix or let YouTube do the mixing of clips. I let YouTube handle it since its free. But it would have been much simpler if the software would let you stitch multiple clips together, maybe in a future update...- Battery life seems to be on the below average side. You would be lucky to get through the day with a full battery.

This has been a crowd pleaser every time I show off the camera.  I've used 3D for many years (film and computer work), so I was a bit jaded by this feature, but it is so much fun to watch others wrap their head around what they are seeing.*  Excellent support from the free software package \"Stereo Photo Maker\".  I've been having great fun making modern prints that can be viewed in an antique stereo card viewer.Ways to improve the product:*  The software is ok, but the driver that recognizes the camera hijacks every other device that I plug into my PC.  Took me a day to figure out why my new Phone7 device was not connecting - the Fuji driver was grabbing the connection and hanging.*  The camera has very limited range for exposure speed and f-stop.  F-stop maxes out at 8, and exposure won't go below 1/2 second.  If any reader knows a workaround, I'm all ears - I'd love to do some light painting in 3D.  Not a showstopper, but it would be nice to be able to play around a little more.*  The lenses are easy to touch and smudge when passing the camera around for viewing.  Worth keeping a lens cloth handy and cleaning often.

This is a message from GOD! (kinda sorta, second hand maybe)Well it started with God. I was watching a baseball game on my plasma TV, ignoring the terrible rain outside, when GOD smited my nice TV set with one helluva lightening strike that tore through a daisy chain of two surge protectors and a UPS. Smoke and a black screen said it all, this TV is toast. So off to find a new one.'Get a 3D', the salesman said. 'Why get old technology?' OK. besides, the 3D volleyball game was great in 3D (the one coming from the DEMO DISK used to demo the screen). So it gets down to how many times can you watch \"A Chance of Meatballs\"? Right now, there is NOTHING OUT THERE IN 3D!So I was driven into the wilderness looking for anything to show my wife as to why I bought what I did... Meatballs was the best of it. Geez. Then a small voice in my head said 'buy the Fuji 3D camera and show your own 3D stuff, that'll get her off your case'. Is this the devil or God talking? I asked as folks wondered if I had a Blue Tooth in my ear that was so small as to not be seen. The voice replied - does it matter?Excellent logic. So an empty wallet and a 3D Fuji pocket camera, ooooooooo, this better work or she'll have everybody we know laughing at me. OK, this is where it gets good. Almost 20 years ago I took 3D video with cameras I built and paired and viewed through a - then - new computer that could genlock - the Amiga. Wow. 3D Video! I made 3D stills and VHS 3D video. In the process I discovered something very weird and which I now must share. Two low res stills seen on the Amiga monitor were taken using a fixed pallette of 255 color (remember those days?) in low res mode. You see a color starved blocky image so typical of that. But use a different pallette of 255 for left  eye and a different color pallette of 255 for the right eye -interlace the two so that both low res images are both seen but the right eye is seeing a different color pallette from the left ---- boing!!!!Something happens - clearly in the head and not in the images themselves. The low res photos are not merely seen as 3D - depthy - they are photorealistic! The color is beautiful!. This is THE BRAIN!So there is my wife with my two grand kids on her lap reading old fashoned kids stories. A mood setting dim room with two side couch table lamps, one tungsten and the other save the earth whatever the hell it is blue. How bad is THAT lighting? But my first images have to catch this scene with 3 & 4 year old wide eyeballs wondering what Pandora would find in that box? Should she open it?OK the camera took expectedly left and right eye stills that were yellow cast on one side and blue cast on the other and grainy as you would expect from low light. But seen on the 3D television with the goggles on (anybody remember x-Specs?) there it was again. The BRAIN. In action. The composite is not just depthy low res. It is what you see when you are there a brain corrected image with surprising detail and normal color (unless you strain to analyse it) for kids on a lap lit by two not so close table lamps. It isn't that same as off color photos that you need to correct as photos when the live thing didn't SEEM off color.I think the key to 3D is not just depth. Something in the brain needs color and as seen by two vantage points that color maps differently and that difference lets the brain wrap images into spatial conceptualities. My experiments also found that it is how we perceive specularity - that twinkle we get from cut glass or from water reflections which simply die in both stills and in ordinary video.Gotta be God.

No other 3D camera comes close to being as feature rich and as easy to use as this camera in this price range. Before I get to my detailed review of this camera here are the pros and cons of this camera.Pros:* Easy to use. Even a non-pro can use it to take beautiful 3D photos.* Glasses free 3D screen. You can view the shots in 3D before taking the photos without using 3D glasses.* Low Price! It's a very low price for such a high end unique product.* Creates 3D movies.* Good stereoscopic 3D separation.* Works with 3D TVs. This camera works with a 3D TV right out of the box (you just need an HDMI cable).* Beautiful photos.Cons:* Hot Pixels in Video. There's no built in option to remove hot pixels in videos shot with the camera.* It's only a point and shoot camera. Because it's a point and shoot camera you can't add your own lenses to it.* Short battery life.Now for my detailed review.EASY TO USE!This camera is extremely simple to use. The automatic mode does everything for you. It selects the correct aperture, ISO settings, flash, etc., as most cameras do, but it also automatically adjusts the correct 3D parallax setting as you focus on your subject and take the picture. For non-3D enthusiasts, who have no idea what 3D parallax is, no worries. Just point and shoot. The camera takes care of it for you. It's that simple. Being a 3D photographer for many years, and owning several different setups, and always having to deal with 3D parallax adjustments, I find this camera's automatic 3D parallax feature to be a godsend. There are times when the automatic parallax values picked by the camera are not optimal, but that only happens if you don't properly focus on your subject. If for some reason you can't properly focus the camera on your subject (because of obstacles in the view) and get the parallax values just right, you can always manually override the parallax values when composing the picture, or afterwards when viewing the picture.GLASSES FREE 3D SCREEN!This is perhaps one of the best things about this camera. The ability to view your subject live in 3D, without glasses, before you take your photo is something that every single 3D camera needs. Without a built in 3D screen, there's no way to know that you've composed your picture properly for 3D viewing until you view it in 3D later on a 3D screen. No matter how experienced you might be, it's very difficult to compose a 3D photo properly without seeing the results in 3D. The built in 3D screen saves you from having to redo your photos later because of bad 3D composition. With this camera, you see it all before taking the shot.Very few 3D cameras allow you to view your subject in 3D before taking the photo. By default, displaying the view live in 3D before taking a 3D photo is disabled. It's disabled for power reasons, because having the 3D screen always in 3D eats your battery faster. By default, when taking 3D photos, the screen only shows your picture in 3D after taking the photo. I found this to be relatively useless. You always want to see the 3D view before taking the 3D photo. So I always have this setting enabled. I think most people would prefer this, and some people probably don't realize that the camera can be configured to view the subject live in 3D before taking the 3D photo. The setting for this is not in an obvious location in the camera's settings menu. Rather than being in the photo settings section, it's found in the power management settings.The screen looks really nice. It has good color, is pretty bright, and is easy to view in 3D. You will have to fiddle with the positioning of it when you first use it to get used to the right position to view it though. If viewed at the wrong distance or angle, the 3D effect can be reversed. I find it very easy to hold in the correct position. I also find it easy on my eyes to view the 3D screen. However, some people have trouble viewing 3D photos in general, and might experience eye discomfort using this camera, or any other 3D camera for that matter. I can however use the camera for hours on end without experiencing any eye discomfort whatsoever.LOW PRICE!This camera on Amazon is selling for a very low price. Put this into perspective. This is essentially 2 good quality digital cameras encased in one with special synchronization hardware required to make it take photos in 3D without any disparity between the two cameras. That's a difficult task. It requires that the lenses be very accurately placed within the camera's body. Getting the two cameras to take photos at precisely the same time, with the correct focus, while being in sync with the camera flash, is not simple. A lot of hard work went into this camera to get this to perform properly. Try doing this yourself with 2 cameras. It is not easy at all. On top of the special hardware needed, a lot of work went into making the software to handle these two cameras, keep them working in sync, automatically adjusting parallax, correct flash timing, etc. You're getting much more than just 2 cameras in one. Using this camera is so much easier than using 2 digital cameras and trying to get 3D yourself. I know. I have such a setup using 2 identical DSLR cameras. It is a pain to use 2 digital cameras. Often you have to redo shots because one camera fails to take the photo properly. To top it off, you can't see your results until much later after spending countless hours combining your 3D photo pairs into one 3D photo. Adjusting 3D parallax, fixing camera tilt, etc. What a headache. With this camera, all of those tedious tasks are a thing of the past. I love this camera!CREATES 3D MOVIES!This is primarily a 3D camera, not a video camera. It's great that it also performs as a 3D video camera but it doesn't have all the bells and whistles that a video camera would normally have. I expected this before buying the camera. It does perform well as a 3D video camera. I have taken some pretty nice HD 3D videos with it. However, there are some issues concerning hot pixels a lot of these cameras have when used as video cameras (see below for more details).GOOD STEREOSCOPIC 3D SEPARATION!The distance between the left and right lenses on this camera is perfect for taking 3D photos of people 5 feet or so from the camera. The 3D effect is rich. Cameras with lenses that are closer together produce inferior 3D effects at this range, and require closer shots for better 3D effects, making taking a picture of a family difficult if you want a good 3D effect. For the typical 3D photos, the 3D separation of the lenses on this camera are just what most people would want for optimal results. However, for closeup shots you really need closer lenses, and for landscape shots of a distant mountain you would need separation of a few feet for a decent 3D effect. Most 3D cameras do not allow the physical 3D separation of the lenses to be changed. That's a limitation this camera has. Having the ability to change this separation would increase the cost of this camera dramatically, and also make it more difficult to use for the average non-3D photographer.If you're taking the typical family photos, this is perfect as is. If you want to take photos of mountains or extreme closeup shots, this camera can do it with its extended 3D shooting modes where you take right and left 3D pairs separately, using 1 lens at a time, but that's pretty difficult to do without the proper tripod and 3D sliding head mounts.WORKS WITH 3D TVS!This is another great feature. The HDMI port on this camera connects directly to todays modern 3D TVs. You can view all your photos and movies directly on your big screen 3D TV easily, all you do is plug in the HDMI cable. No setup needed. It's very convenient.BEAUTIFUL PHOTOS!My camera takes beautiful photos. The 3D pairs in the photos are properly aligned. There are no tilt problems. Colors are rich. The images, both right and left, are very sharp when taken properly. I feel that I have 2 very high quality cameras in one which are precisely aligned. Both lenses take great photos.I once saw a very negative review about this camera complaining about alignment problems, focus problems, tilt problems, etc. My camera has none of those issues when properly used. However, if you try you can cause any 3D camera to produce such bad shots, by using the camera improperly. For example, if you position the left lens closer to your subject than the right lens, all 3D cameras will produce alignment problems that are difficult to fix. Also, if you don't properly wait for the focus light indicator to tell you both lenses are in focus, you can get focus problems. I use the camera properly and I get very consistent high quality 3D photos from it. Occasionally I don't wait for the focus to fix on a subject and so get a bad shot, but that's my own fault.Take some time to learn how to use 3D cameras properly and you'll be very satisfied with this camera. I think a lot of people don't realize how difficult it can be to take a 3D photo properly. This camera makes it a million times easier than most other 3D cameras, but there are still some things you need to watch out for when taking 3D photos. Always make sure your right and left lenses are at the same distance from your subject. Always check the 3D screen to make sure your parallax is what you want before taking the photo. Bad parallax adjustments can be hard to fix if they are too far out of range when the photo is taken. And always make sure you have good focus on your subject for BOTH lenses. Because there are two lenses, it's always possible for one lens to be focused on one item in your photo and the other to be focused on another item. This camera can't perform magic. You are ultimately responsible for assuring that the camera is automatically focused on the right subject in your photo. The focus indicator needs to be used properly to take a good 3D photo. Make sure the focus indicator is properly positioned on your main subject in 3D before taking the photo in 3D. For example, if you are taking a picture of a flower, and the right lens is focused properly on the flower, but the left lens is focused on a tree behind the flower, and you accept that as \"in focus\" and take your photo then you'll have a bad 3D photo. You can tell this is the case in the 3D screen before you take the photo because the focus indicator in one eye's view will be on the flower and the other will be on the tree. If you take such a bad shot, don't blame the camera. These problems are specific to 3D photography no matter what camera you use. Once you learn how to avoid these kinds of problems, you'll be taking great 3D pictures nearly all the time.Now for the bad side of this camera.HOT PIXELS IN VIDEO:(Like many cameras not truly made for taking video, this camera can suffer from hot pixels. This is a complaint I've seen in a lot of other reviews. My camera has 1 hot pixel on the right censor, and one on the left. They are in different locations. It's hard to notice them in normal video conditions. They become very apparent when shooting dark scenes. Many cameras have a few hot pixels on their sensors, but they contain software that effectively removes them from the recorded video. This camera unfortunately doesn't have hot pixel removal when shooting video. My camera does seem to have hot pixel removal when taking photos. I have never seen a hot pixel in any photos I've taken, only in video shot in dark places. This has been reported by quite a few other people using this camera.My suggestion to FujiFilm is to update the firmware to add hot pixel removal from video shot with the camera. This is a simple thing to add. I almost felt like reducing my rating for this camera because it lacks this feature, but my overall satisfaction with this camera still remains very high despite this problem, so I decided not reduce my rating because of this flaw.IT'S ONLY A POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA:(This is actually a positive for many people, but being a guy used to using DSLRs cameras with interchangeable lenses, the ability to add filters, etc., I miss this kind of functionality. There is no way to add any lens filters, or extensions, or change the lenses. That's the design of a point and shoot camera. Oh well. I would like at least the ability to add lens filters, but I am spoiled I guess.SHORT BATTERY LIFE:(This is a common complaint about this camera. I didn't think much about this until I started taking a lot of photos and this was becoming a problem. I have ordered 2 additional batteries, and an extra car/home charger for the batteries, so that I can pop in a new fully charged battery when the current one dies. Because this is actually 2 cameras in 1, with a very large 3D display, it's no wonder it eats up your batter pretty fast. FujiFilm could have included a much larger and heavier battery to solve this problem, but I am actually glad they didn't. I like the fact that this camera is not so heavy and not so big. I would rather have the inconvenience of having to replace the battery once in a while during a photo shoot than having to lug around a larger camera with a huge heavy battery. So while this is a negative, it's not one that FujiFilm could have really fixed without making the camera larger and heavier. I think they made the right decision by keeping the camera light and small.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "J. Haindel \"Jay\"", "ReviewID": "R32SWZQA1J1WZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had read every review & comment I could find on the internet before purchasing this camera.  The negative reviews were a little unsettling and I anticipated that the camera would have many of the shortcomings mentioned.  When it arrived,the first surprise was the opening screen.  It is in 3D! The first pictures I took blew me away!  All I can say is \"Wow!\"  Either I got an above average camera or something has been changed in the production line as of late. The controls are very similar to most other cameras and being familiar with them, the learning curve was very easy. The pictures are as clear as my \"twice as expensive\" Canon camera.  The 3D is incredible!  The automatic and manual controls are even better than my Canon.  For several days I could not find anything wrong with this camera, but there are a few things you need to be aware of.  The viewing screen is solely inadequate in bright light.  You just point and shoot not seeing anything except where the camera is pointing, but, the camera does it all really well, the exposure, the focus and the white balance.  Also, the 3D view finder is limited by the technology of today.  Since you do not need special glasses for viewing your photographs, you have to hold the camera in a \"just right\" position otherwise you get dizzy trying to focus on the picture.The lenses are small in order to have two of them on the camera and results in some limitations.  It tends to have a limited exposure range in that the light or white objects being photographed can easily be washed out especially if the rest of the scene is somewhat dark.  It also places some limit on poorly lighted subjects such as night shots, but, surprisingly, I got some really good night shots without a flash in some really dark environments.It is hard on batteries. The solution is just to buy some extra ones.  They are really cheap here on Amazon.One other problem I have encountered is how to view the pictures.  The view finder does really well but it is tiny.  If you look at them on your computer you will have to use the anaglyph system which is the old red/blue glasses.  I am not at all enamored with them as they kill the color and the photo looks unrealistic. I understand you can purchase a 3D monitor.  I use my 3D TV and the photos look fantastic on it.  This is the way to view them in my opinion.  There is a shortcoming though, in that, if you modify the photo in any way, it will not view in 3D on your TV.  It will present the 3D photo in 2D only. I learned that because I used the parallax control to obtain some really good macro shots, I then found the TV will not show them in 3D.  Very disappointing.  You can expect this if you crop, resize or the use of the parallax control. This means you must use the picture just as it is from the camera without any modifications or they will display in 2D only.I have very limited experience with the video mode.  It worked well when I tried it and hope to experiment more. The picture quality did not seem quite as good as with still pictures but look mighty fine on my 3D TV.  This is a still camera with video capabilities which limits it some.Now for the positive.  This camera is amazing!  The 3D clarity is way past my expectations.  It is a whole new world of photography with real life results.The colors are beautiful and accurate.  The focus is right on as long as you do not get too close. (the camera cannot turn it's lens inward to focus on a close object like your eyes)  I cannot believe this camera is not more popular and for the life of me, why would Fuji stop production.  This thing is a gem!  You will love it if you have a 3D television.  My only regret is why I waited so long to purchase it.

The 3D W3 delivers in spades.Because of my background in creating 3D images, I had a pretty specific set of requirements for a camera like this.  For a long time, those requirements were hypothetical because such a camera didn't exist, but thanks to the modern iterations of 3D in the home and in movie theaters, companies like Fujifilm have acknowledged that a market for 3D cameras exists.  Granted, it's still a niche market, but it's growing.  Anyway, my main requirements were that the camera take 3D video, that it has some manual controls, and that the format it saved its photo and video files in be standardized to allow for editing in non-proprietary software.  Again, Fujifilm really delivered in this aspect.The manual controls available on this camera are pretty impressive, for what this camera is.  You can manually set ISO, shutter speed and aperture, and after your 3D photo has been taken, you can adjust the parallax to fine-tune the depth of your shot.  This is especially important because Fujifilm decided to place the lenses further apart than human eyes are to help make the depth of the shots more dramatic.  I see where they were going with that, but I find that manually adjusting the parallax is something I have to do with a good portion of my shots.  Thankfully, they had the foresight to make this feature both simple and non-destructive, meaning that your adjustments are saved as an additional file without overwriting your source photo.The camera is fun and easy to use.  As long as you watch your fingers (the two lenses can be easily covered if you're not paying attention) getting a solid, attractive image from this camera is a cinch.  The implementation of the 3D screen on the back was very well done, too - a half-press of the shutter button locks focus and engages 3D mode, allowing you to line up your shot in 3D.  The zoom on this camera is a modest 3x optical, but it encourages you to get intimate with what your shooting and really think about the depth of the final product.  Interestingly, the zoom feature moves internally, allowing the zoom to occur on both lenses without having them stick out of the camera.  The body of the camera is a bit chunky by point-and-shoot standards, but easy to get used to.  For those who use a tripod, the mount is off-center, which was not really a big deal to me.The photo quality of this product is impressive.  The sensors are 10MP CCD, which by today's standards is decent but not great.  However, the camera still produces high-quality shots with ease, and after using this product it's clear that while the camera provides ample clarity and detail, the real star of the show is depth (which is also impressively captured).  Video quality on this camera is good.  It only captures at 720p/24FPS, but I prefer shooting at 24FPS anyway because it provides a more cinematic look to the finished product.  This may be a deal-breaker for those who won't accept less than 30FPS, but again my past experience with video has acclimated me to the look of 24FPS to the point that I prefer it.  The stereo mics pick up a great amount of detail as well.  The photo format is JPEG+MPO, saving a 2D and 3D file for each shot you take.  This is a nice feature, but you can disable it if you wish.  The video format is 3D-AVI.  One point of concern is that you will need the MJPEG codec installed to work with this file type, but I was able to get it working in both Linux (Mint 14) and Windows 7.As a side note, to get the codec installed and functioning in Linux, I installed it using WINE and launched my editor (which is also a Windows application) using WINE as well.  I'm not sure if a WINE-installed codec would propagate on an editor which does not use WINE, but I would hazard to guess probably not.This camera has really simplified the way I shoot 3D.  I have produced 3D anaglyphs and other formats for quite a few years, almost always utilizing a one-camera, shoot-left-then-shoot-right method that didn't allow me to see the 3D effect until I stitched the images together on my computer.  I had ventured into the double-camera method a few times, but I never got satisfactory results because buying two identical cameras for the rig was not cost-effective.  I had meager success with video over the years because the camcorders I used were both lousy.  Thankfully, Fujifilm has laid those days to rest with this product.  Now, with a camera that will fit in a shirt-pocket, I can capture 720p video and candid stills without moving a tripod or merely guessing how the 3D will look when the process is done.  I can look at the screen and tell straight away whether the shot was good enough to keep or not, no guessing required.Fujifilm should be commended for the creation of this product.  It's an amazing camera that centralizes a lot of 3D features into one camera.  I would write a letter of thanks to the company, but I feel like a glowing review would be better.

That's how drastic the difference is.On the camera there's an infrared window but no mention of it in the manual. I wonder if it's for the picture frame's remote or if it can be used as a remote trigger.I was bummer at first when I found that it could only record 11 minutes of HD video, as my bike rides would take longer than that. The camera came with firmware 1.0 and I found a firmware update to 1.2 which added an \"economy\" HD mode, doubling it to 23 minutes.Instead of following the convoluted upgrade procedure via PC/USB I just copied the firmware file to the SD card and turned the camera on while holding the display button and it reflashed the firmware all the same.After some testing I found that it doesn't stop recording after 11 or 23 minutes, it only pauses briefly to start a new file after 2GB, so it's actually possible to record 3 hours of HD on a 32GB card without touching the camera and splice it later.The battery probably wouldn't last that long anyway.All in all I'm really glad I bought this camera.

I started with a Kodak Stereo, a slide film camera made in 1954. I later used pairs of Pentax SLRs, and about 10 years ago, managed to synchronize digital cameras for stereoscopic shots. So basically, I know about 3D photography.Fujifilm was the first major manufacturer to market a stereo digital camera, the Fuji FinePix W1. The W1 was a good point-n-shoot digital with 3D, but it had an awkward design for the controls and shot standard definition video. The W3 has better controls and can shot 3D video in 720p. Still images are saved in MPO (multi-picture object) format. Many display devices and 3D HDTVs can use the files, or you can convert them using free software. I recommend StereoPhoto Maker to adjust and convert 3D photos [...].In general, the W3 is a good 3D camera, with the features you expect from a modern point-n-shoot. It has 10 megapixels for each lens. It comes with a variety of built in exposure settings, as well as full manual. Many 3D photography enthusiasts use it as their main 3D camera because it is small and compact. Much easier to use than a pair of digital cameras that have been synchronized and aligned with a custom bracket. The \"glasses free\" 3D LCD screen is very good. You can see your 3D photos and videos on the camera.One thing that sets the W3 apart from other stereoscopic digital cameras and camcorders is the lens separation. The W3 has a 75mm distance between the left and right lenses. This is close to average human eye separation (~65mm). The result is 3D photos with natural depth. Other stereoscopic cameras and camcorders us much less lens separation, for example the HTC Evo 3D smart phone has a lens separation (stereo base) of only about 32mm. That means you're getting the 3D view of a cat or other small animal. The photographs with a small stereo base are good for close ups, but look flat and unnatural for most other photography. Why do other cameras use an unnatural lens separation? Probably because it allows you to do close ups. You can't take a 3D photo close to someone with the W3. You need to be about six feet away from the closest object when using the W3, close ups are impossible to view. An ideal 3D camera would have variable lens separation.  Maybe someday Fuji or someone else will make such a camera.As great as it is, unfortunately the W3 has the same limitations as other point-n-shoot digital cameras. For example, it is difficult to see the screen in bright sunlight and the video quality is not great. Still, I highly recommend this camera. Why take flat photos when you can have them in 3D?", "Date": "October 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Photography TIme Machine.. takes you back in time to the 'FUN' days of photography", "Author": "MichaelAndrewDalton", "ReviewID": "R3K3EFBWJ5GOWP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received my FujiFilm W3, unboxed it, charged the battery, inserted an SDHC memory card, and after just a few shots, I was transported back to the first time I experienced the magic of photography. No, I am not being melodramatic. This little marvel of technology literally puts you back where you started with photography. It creates a sense of awe and wonder when you see in the amazing viewfinder, what for all intents and purposes appears to be a 3 dimensional recreation of the object you just photographed. I took a couple shots of people in the office, and it looked like I had shrunk them to ultra-miniature and put them inside the LCD viewing screen.In a word, this camera is FUN. And I am a very seasoned semi-pro-level shooter, have used some of the best prosumer Nikon, Olympus, Fuji, and Sigma gear available, but the FujiFilm W3 has earned a very special place in my arsenal of tools, and equally important, toys!At the ridiculously low street-price of under $240, -just buy it! You will not be disappointed.The 3D images are so intriguing, anything they might lack in a 2D image version is not worth worrying about. I mean, this is not a Nikon D800, but it isn't supposed to be! The 3D images look great, and some are nothing short of astounding.Also, there are many tools available that let you 'extract' two JPEG images from the MPO file and convert those into two images that can be viewed on a PC wearing those red-blue 3D glasses. And that works very well, too, so you can share your fun and excitement with others.Having shot \"around the house' I am anxious to get out this weekend and truly exploit this camera's capabilities with some serious photography. Remember, this IS a Fuji camera, and as such, it has the great majority of the settings and options you would expect from a camera made by FujiFilm.These include: full manual, aperture, and programmed priority modes, exposure compensation, flash control, many, many scene settings, normal, chrome (vivid) and black & white modes, a 3x OPTICAL zoom, manual AND fully automatic 3D shooting, interval-timed 3D shooting (yes, really!), self-timer, and silent-mode, just to name the things I can remember off the top of my head.Remember though, you have to view the 3D images on the camera's LCD (which looks GREAT), or on a 3D TV, or 3D PC, or FUji's own (expensive) 3D photo-frame, OR (and this is almost a no brainer option) convert the images to 2 JPEGS and view with anaglyph (blue-red) glasses. I should mention that you can save the images as MPO (3D) and extract JPEGS with 3rd party software, -or- you can have them stored as MPO+JPEG via a setup option.And, if you are a MAC user, note that the software that ships with this camera (as of this writing, July 2012) is completely useless, and you will want something else, like \"AnaglyphMaker\", \"Anaglyph Workshop\" both freely downloadable from the web, to convert the images for viewing on your mac with the red-blue glasses.Also, you should be aware that the nature of 3D photography limits certain aspects of the camera's ability to automatically adjust the two images when you are \"up close\". But, Fuji built corrective tools into the camera, so you can, for example correct parralex for close-up shots, and the camera will save the adjusted image without altering the original. My point is that this is a camera made for 3D, and 3D shooting is different from 2D, consequently you should expect some \"AHAs!\" as you learn how to really use this camera.Buy at your own risk, but for my 2-cents worth, at this price-point, it's the most fun I have had with a compact camera in a long time..... and the quality seems worth every penny.... as long as you know that your viewing options are as stated in this review, at least for now.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "unbeatable compact, sturdy, great with a 3dTV!", "Author": "Boris Starosta", "ReviewID": "R26S4CZPVXN2K1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have extensive experience (since 1998) with 3d cameras of all kinds, and have built my own twin camera rigs.I've been using the Fuji W3 for about a year.  It is a nice performer given its small size.  It produces images with perfect synchronization (including the video clips), and pretty good alignment.  The image quality is decent.  It has held up very well in rough use, surviving a couple of drops onto hardwood with no apparent ill effect.  It seems a very sturdy, well made camera.The first six months I had the camera, I used it much like my other 3d cameras - producing image files that I would later work on to make 3d pictures (anaglyph prints or stereocards).  Then we got a 3dTV  (A polarized passive 3d VIZIO)...... and a new world is dawning!  The camera has been a mind-boggling 3d photo tool since then.  It is incredible to realize that 3dTV manufacturers and Fuji have not gotten together to co-market these products.  The Fuji W3 camera seems invented for use with 3dTV, and vice versa.  Yet hardly anyone who owns such a TV even knows about the camera.  The images look so good on the 3dTV, and are incredibly easy to view.  Gone is the traditional work needed to process your stereo image files, to make them presentable to others.  You can come home from a trip / party / event, and within 30 seconds be watching brilliant 3d videos or stills on your 3dTV.Though we have numerous movies / 3d blurays to watch on the 3dTV, probably 75% of the 3dTV use is to enjoy our own material shot with the Fuji camera.A note about the separation of the lenses on the Fuji.  Panasonic now has a camera out (Sony Bloggie too), which has more closely spaced lenses.  The closer spacing on those cameras is better suited to close-up photography - from headshots to interiors (<20ft.).  The spacing on the Fuji produces an excellent 3d effect for distances from 6 feet out to maybe 50 or even 100 feet.  But when you shoot very close-up with the Fuji, you may see distortion or excessive 3d effect, depending on your composition.  Experimenting is the best way to learn the craft of 3d photography.I prefer the lens spacing on the Fuji because I love outdoors photography.  Nature photography is so much fun with this camera!  There is no better tool for capturing strange little animals, flowers, rocks, mushrooms, waterfalls, etc. etc.  The camera includes an advanced mode allowing \"sequential\" acquisition of stereo images - this permits very close up and even macro stereo photography.PROSgood image quality (I shoot all in 5M mode).good HD video quality in bright lightsturdy!several shooting modes including full manualCONSpoor battery life!

This slight flutter may have been from that particular television (we didn't try any other ones), but the pictures and video were VERY impressive and looked VERY 3D.

Things like distance - not closer than 5 feet or more than 200 yards (still quite a range).  The most important thing to remember is rather than shooting head on, shoot from an angle so that multiple focus points are included in the picture - which makes the 3-D effect really pop.

But how many people print their pictures these days anyway?The software that comes with the camera does not seem all that usefull, so I downloaded free software for viewing pictures and movies in 3D using red/cyan glasses (StereoMovie Maker and StereoPhoto Maker).Those programs are so cool to use in viewing your Fujifilm 3D shots!Maybe I'll get a 3D TV someday but for now I'm enjoying getting lots of pictures and movies made in 3D.UPDATE:  I recently bought one of the 3D folding viewers for less than twenty bucks and have had a great time making stereo prints for viewing my FujiFilm W3 pics.  It's an excellent option for showing others your photos in 3D without spending alot.  I use the free stereophoto program to crop the pictures and then use the saved image file to place into a 3:2 aspect ratio image frame so they can be printed as a standard 4X6 photo at the one-hour photo.  You can also use the software to print out images on your color photo printer using the program's stereo-card format.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "For a point-and-shoot 3D camera, this is a fantastic product.", "Author": "Chris Stringer", "ReviewID": "R8L8Q8UIUUE92", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the world of consumer-grade electronic point-and-shoot 3D cameras, there isn't a whole lot to choose from. That's why Fuji is to be commended for creating such a fabulous entry into this tiny niche. The W3 is a rugged, compact 3D camera with an impressive, beautiful auto-stereoscopic display. There are plenty of useful presets as well as manual shooting modes. The accommodations for cha-cha style shooting (fusing 2 separate 2D shots into a single 3D image) is appreciated and comes in handy for airplane and landscape photography. Although I haven't purchased any myself, there are some very worthwhile 3rd party add-ons for this camera...Cyclopital3d is a good place to start for that sort of thing.The W3 is not perfect, especially when it comes to handling the extremes in high or low-light conditions, but for everyday use, it is truly wonderful and has proven to be fairly reliable. I had to send mine back during the warranty period due to an exposure imbalance between the two lenses (one lens consistently created a bloom exposure effect which was very noticeable and annoying), and it was promptly fixed and returned to me in perfect working condition. Battery life is so-so (maybe a bit on the short side), but extra rechargeable batteries are relatively cheap, so I would recommend getting several and having them charged and on hand to avoid any aggravation later.Overall, I have been very happy with this camera and have taken many thousands of pictures with it over the last few years. Now that these have been discontinued, I am tempted to pick up one or two more just to have in case this one dies, or to have at an event with friends to get multiple points of view in 3D.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Impressive, but with a learning curve", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Gadgeteer\"", "ReviewID": "R3TI74MDNTYAQM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This really does take 3D pix - nice ones in fact.  I can display them on my monitor (I have a 3D monitor from LG for modeling and design) as well as the camera screen.  A few things to note though:1) Do not over-correct using the manual parallax adjustment - the automatic settings is pretty good actually.  It may seem like you are improving the shot (at least on the camera screen) to narrow the viewpoint down to the target specifically but when you look at it on a bigger monitor, you eyeballs want to part ways and leave your brain hanging in the wind.  If you must manually controll the parallax, leave some slough between your actual focus and the nearby surroundings - let the viewers eyes determine the focal point - much more comfortable.2) Battery is small for the camera.  It lasts longer than I thought it might, but carry an extra - it IS powering twice as much equipment as a normal camera after all.  Two lenses and their focusing apparatus instead of one.3) Not really an issue, but be aware that there is not a LOT of software out there for dealing with MPO files.  The good thing is that every image is saved as both an MPO and a JPG.  So, even with out an MPO browser, your computer (even if it is Linux) can still view at least the 2D versions.I have yet to try getting a 3D print done, but am looking forward to it.

I agree with other reviewers that it has very serious shortcomings as a camera.  It provides resolution and detail at a level that might be expected from a four or five megapixel camera, rather than the ten megapixels claimed. Also the right and left images differ noticeably in brightness and color.  This isn't a total killer, but it's noticeable and annoying.  My everyday snapshot camera is a 12 megapixel Canon Elph, and the difference is tremendous.On the upside, it's definitely a cool gadget if you're a stereo photography hobbyist. Software is available to split the MPO images: for Windows, mposplit.com, $12 for software that works well and is easy to use once you've walked yourself through it; for Mac, alienrat.net/software/mposplit.html, freeware.  These provide a left and right image that you can edit, crop, (I just use Picasa for this) and print out through some other program (I use CorelDraw x5; I'm sure Photoshop and Illustrator and probably other simpler programs will work also.)You can then print out the left and right images side-by-side for freeviewing or make stereocards to view through a stereoscope. (Why has no one ever manufactured a good-quality modern stereoscope?)I've printed out sheets with side-by-side images that I then scan and freeview quite successfully on the computer - I actually get the best results by mailing them to myself and viewing them on gmail. The Fuji software that comes with the camera shows you a left and right image, but does not actually split the MPO image; it also allows you to view a stereo image on the computer, but as a red-blue anaglyph that's a total joke.The camera is loaded with features that are mostly not very useful.  It's a very high-tech item and could have been a genuinely good camera, but it's not.  Still, at it's current price of less than $160 on Amazon it's a good buy for stereo geeks. I'd grab one fast; this huge price reduction indicates to me that this is an item that's being remaindered off as the current 3D boom recedes.It's possible use as a 3D tv add-on is something I know nothing about.

It is basically (also) two cameras in one. The 3D pictures are clear and the depth without making any adjustment is very nice to look at though the screen could be a little bit bigger, and it is really an attention getter in parties.For me at low light with its flash engaged, the pictures are acceptable. The noise level is low.The only thing with this camera is that though you can take 2D pictures with ease, it is made and advertised in 3D. But in 3D mode you can only view and take pictures in landscape position. That means when you move the camera in portrait position the 3D is gone. Take a picture of your loved ones standing (in portrait), and you can only perceived them in 3D in landscape position (not really nice). You can not rotate pictures taken in 3D.  When you transfer the image in your computer it copies a set of 2D and a 3D of each file so you have an option of printing it at home or sent the 3D ones for printing in Fuji lab. I sent several pictures for 3D printing including the one taken in portrait mode hoping that in this day and age someone in the lab could have just rotated the picture. Unfortunately they just print it as it is and sent you a note  that some of the pictures are not suitable for 3D printing. For me, the 3D print is clear and nice but the depth is not as good as the camera screen. Also the print is very expensive. So make sure the subject of the pictures you sent is not too close to the camera because during printing it crops the pictures.There you have it, I hope this short review will help you decide if this camera is right for you.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Impressive 3D", "Author": "David Wilson", "ReviewID": "R10GQ6NYMUUUKJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Read many reviews before purchasing this camera and most were positive so I decided to take the plunge.

Stereoscopic digital 3D photography in the palm of your hand.  This is an absolutely terrific product and a *whole* lot of fun.  You'll need a 3D display device (like a 3D TV or 3D PC display) to really make good use of it though.  It can display to 3D TVs via an optional mini-HDMI cable (that comes with the \"Real 3D W3 Accessory Kit\" I bought elsewhere and includes a nice leather camera case).To truly maximize your fun you'll need a 3D PC monitor so you can edit 3D videos and learn to tweak & enhance you're the 3D photos (as well as play games in stereoscopic 3d)!  For editing I started with the CyberLink PowerDirector software, a relatively inexpensive editing package for 3D productions.  It has a simplistic user interface and tool-set, very easy to use, and displays your video in 3D the entire time as you edit.  Neat.  It came as part of the CyberLink Media suite, which also includes \"Media Show\", a program that will display your fully edited videos on your PC's 3D monitor, full screen.For more serious editing though I've been using Sony Vegas Pro 12.  This has way more tools that you'll ever need, but has everything you really do need.  I particularly liked I could edit, even animate, the stereoscopic parallax in Vegas (this bring items out of the screen or pushes them in deeper), and its anti-shake filter is way better than anybody elses.  All effects in Vegas can be key-framed (programmed to change over time) and I've used this a lot to stabilize brightness and contrast under tricky lighting conditions and build up compositing and picture-in-picture effects, all in 3D.The W3 camera's photo mode is its strong point.  It's superb.  Awesome resolution and 3D depth.  Everybody that's seen it on my PC is blown away.  The video mode however is 720P, which at first seemed such a big step down from the Hi-Res Photo mode that I wasn't sure how I could work with it.  After a month of playing around with it though I realized 3D-video requires a different shooting style.  Fast cuts are definitely out.  You need to keep the camera much more stable and let the action proceed in front of it.  This lets the audience focus into the 3D environment and \"space\" you're shooting into, which is the key point.  The camera has no built-in anti-shake features for the 3D video so I use a tripod where I can, or a bolt on hand-hold \"L\" bracket for greater stability otherwise.I really like this camera a lot, and frankly, I stopped using my more expensive Canon because the 3D effect can be used so artistically.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Tech Reviews and Help review on this product", "Author": "Craig T.

To view the review on the site and see some pictures this camera too, go to the following link [...]The Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W3 camera has been out for a little while, but it still is one of the best cameras out there on a budget. But, there is a few pros and cons to this product like all other products out there.(NOTE) We bought everything in this review, and the following was used on this camera while we were reviewing it.  One (1) 32 GB class 10 SD card.  (We found you must have a class 10 for this camera)  One (1) new 3D W3 camera  One (1) Np-50 Digital Camera Replacement Lithium-ion Battery (The battery life is short and it's best to always have a backup if your taking pictures away from home.  One (1) High-Speed A to C Type Mini HDMI (Used to connect the camera to a 3D TV)  One (1) Neoprene Cover Carrying Case. (The camera doesn't come with one)  One (1) screen protector. (The camera isn't cheap so this is a must)  One (1) Tripod  One (1) Stereo Photo Maker (Free software)Note: To use this camera you should get a class 10 SD card. We picked a 32 GB because the price hikes up by a bit when you get anything bigger than a 32 GB class 10. Also, we highly advice you to buy another battery. It is best to have an extra set of batteries for your cameras when your away from home.The best software we found for free for 3D pictures is Stereo Photo Maker.You can get an underwater case for this camera, but the cost for a case maybe to high for many people. We did not get an underwater case because it was out of our budget.The reason why a TRH staff member has this camera:I bought this camera for personal use. I wanted to take as real pictures as possible of my family and other things while being on a budget.(Believe it or not, 3D photos of love ones means a lot more to most people than 2D images. Plus it gives a true understanding of what something/someone looks like when you can see it in 3D but you can't see it/them in real life.)Plus giving 3D pictures that you can hang on the wall as a gift kinda one up everyone else who is giving gifts.Out of the box:The camera comes with the following.  One (1) camera  4 manuals (some in different language)  A CD with some useless software. (The software is useless. You can get free software that is listed above that will do a great job)  One (1) special USB cable for the camera.  One (1) battery for the camera. (NP-50)  One (1) Battery charger.  One (1) strapNote: It is best to charge the battery before you put it in the camera. The charge takes a long time.Setup:The setup is simple. There is a spot on the bottom of the camera where the battery and the SD card goes. Just put in the battery and SD in. Then when you turn the camera on, you have to do the following.  Choose a language  Set the date and time  Choose a power management optionNote: If the battery is charge and it is left in the camera for about four (4) days, the battery can be removed for about a week without resetting the selection above. Keep in mind all pictures and video will be saved on your SD card. The SD card will not be effected by the battery being in or out.After this setup, you can start using this cameraFeatures:The features behind this camera include the following.  3D/2D picture and video (3D can be play on 2D on the camera if you want)  3D/2D viewing screen on the camera.  Auto and manual controls  You can take 2 different pictures at the same time. Take a high and low resolution. A zoom in and far out picture. A black & white and regular color picture. (2D only)  Advance 3D settings. In auto it is prefer your subject and all the foreground is at least 4 feet away. In 3D advance mode, you can take landscape photos or really close up pictures in 3D.  Program settings.  Self timer. (2 and 10 seconds)  Parallax control.  The on/off switch is the lens cover. When you push down the cover it turns on.  HDMI (Must have a mini HDMI)  A/V connector  10 MP  Two (2) 3x optical zoom lenses for a 35-105mm equivalent zoom range.  Some slight digital zoom in 2D when optical zoom is max out.  Eliminate red-eye.  Face detection.  Click on the picture to see it in full size. The picture was taken by this camera.  Obviously it is in 2D.Pros:In using this camera I found many pros with this camera. Pros like the following.  The camera is in 3D.  The camera takes 2D images while it takes 3D. The 2D images have more noise, but it's better than asking someone to sit there for a little longer or losing a moment.  The camera takes 2D video while it takes 3D video. The video is not that bad, but it reminds me of a high end smartphone video.  The 3x optical zoom is not like some cameras. Some camera that says 3x optical zoom only zoom in 3 times. You can not get between the zooms. On this camera you can.  There is a little digital zoom on the 2D mode. I was trying to take a picture of a wild life far away from me, and zooming out all the way with both optical and digital I was able to get the picture.  The front of the camera tells you if someone is taking a 3D picture of you.  The front of the camera tells you when the camera is about to take a picture when it is in timer mode. The 3D icon will flash.  The camera shows video and pictures in 3D on the screen.  The camera is not heavy.  The camera can convert 3D into 2D.  The camera is loaded with features.  I will admit it. I don't know too much about how to set up a camera to get the best shot. But being able to take pictures at different ISO levels with the 2 different lenses, I was able to figure out how to exactly set it up to get the best picture.Cons:Like all products there is bad things. Below is the list of bad things.  You can not charge the battery via USB. You have to take it out.  The camera is hard to hold when your taking 3D shots.  The 3D screen has an extremely small viewing angle.  The battery has a short lifespan.  The software that comes with the camera is useless.  The cost of the camera is kinda high. We were able to get it for $230 due to Amazon Prime. But, at full price it is close to $600. Our budget for this camera was $300 so we were lucky. (Every day that has went by after we bought it, the price has went up a little on Amazon Prime.)  The 3D function in the camera is kinda useless to the majority of people out there. The only way most people can video 3D content is by using the camera or ordering 3D pictures to put on their wall. The 3D prints are about $30 a print. FujiFilm is the worst place to get prints. We found [...] and [...] to be the best. Snap3D is currently replacing their 3D stuff so you will have to use Start 3D for now.  The screen has to be constantly clean. It's almost a must when it comes to a protector.  You can not delete groups of pictures and videos on the camera.  The manuals are horrible at telling you how to work the camera if you're a noob with cameras.Overall:Like I said, I got this camera so I can take pictures with my family as life-like as possible on a budget. Because a requirement behind that is to take pictures in 3D, I would recommend this camera. After doing a month of research, I found this camera is the best 3D camera out there on a budget. But if you're not on a budget, there is several thousand dollar cameras that are much better than this one.But if you need a regular 2D camera, I would advice you to pick up something else.", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fugifilm FinePix Real 3D Camera opinion", "Author": "Picture taken Tom", "ReviewID": "R3GXUBYTZ1WXWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera just for fun.

I bought mine knowing that we might not have great technology for displaying this photos today, but one day the tech might be better and I'll be happy that I recorded these moments with two lenses.The screen (while not perfect) is very nice and sharp. Things appear very lifelike in the pictures when done right. It can be tricky to take a photo that shows up well, but the dozen or so I've taken so far that have come out well look amazing. My friends and family are blown away when they see them on the screen. It's not about crazy \"things popping out omg\", it's about, the subtle bit of depth that you get in people's faces for portraits, group shots or pictures of objects just makes it feel like you're looking at the thing in real life. It's really something special that helps you remember the moment more than any flat 2D shot.Downsides of course, battery life isn't terribly long so never forget your charger at home. I guess that's what happens when you're running two cameras in one and have a parallax barrier screen / a price of having early tech. Also, you will totally go cross-eyed if you look at these pictures for too long. When taken improperly, some photos will come out so awful it'll give you a headache to just look at them. I recommend turning on 2D mode or just closing one eye and then disposing of those ones.In summary, if you're looking for a new primary use-for-every-picture-you-take camera, this isn't it.

Matot \"GMS\"", "ReviewID": "RDWLWVPC4NCFN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera only a few weeks, so my review will evolve over time. My computer use is primarily Mac based, but I do have an older cheap PC tower.This camera cannot be used in 3D mode on a mac. You can however edit and use 2D photos and videos just fine on the mac with existing software and included software. To access the 3D files on the camera with 3D data intact as of today it needs to be done on a PC using XP, Vista, or Win7. It comes with a pc program called 3D photo studio, which comes missing a motion jpeg encoder/decoder. It comes with a demo version of someones driver that has a built in delay and watermark, so technically, to use the software on a PC in 3D mode, the software is missing a required driver, which is expensive to purchase outright. Without this decoder the included software will not function, period. Essentially, this camera comes with defective software, and there is no upgrade or fix that does not cost you additional money (I think it is in the range of $75)With this software you can change 3D videos and stills to a format usable on services like youtube.This camera will connect to a modern 3D TV if you purchase a mini HDMI to HDMI cable and play the stills and videos on your TV. The ones I made and watched on TV look fantastic. I also own an Aiptek 3D camera and the quality of this camera far exceed the Aiptek camera.Many reviewers suggest, and I agree, it is best to use this camera with some sort of stand because it is so so easy to accidentally put your fingers in front of the lenses.Putting the camera in silent mode also shuts off the flash!??  Huh?  I guess they think the little pop sound of the flash makes too much noise?There is one software update available from Fujifilm so far. I tried to do it, but could not make it work. The update has something to do with \"economy mode\" which I also have not encountered yet.  I did read whole chunks of the manual that comes on the CD with the camera, and it is littered with missing info and circular loops that go nowhere (ex: see page 95 for lens info, but on page 99 it says see the referring page).  There is a decent user group on yahoo groups.Otherwise I am pleased with this camera. I bought my first one from DP's Elite Exports but returned it because the image sensor was badly damaged, so be careful if you purchase a discounted camera because there are many out there for sale that are defective but being re-sold and re-sold.Update: I've had this camera for the better part of a year now. Taken it on two vacations. Works as intended every time. No problems really. I  might offer these comments: !. Fuji will not update the software in this camera. What it is when you buy it is all it will ever be. 2. I hear in yahoo groups that there are add-on accessory lenses available for this camera. 3. In broad daylight the screen cannot be seen. In shaded broad daylight the screen can barely be seen. 4. It's low light performance is poor. 5. There is no way to shut off recording audio, the audio recorded is poor. 6. It has always interfaced with 3D tv and projectors with no problems at all. 7. fits nicely in cargo pants pocket. 8. Get a couple extra batteries if going on vacation. 8. I think that you can edit 3D videos on a windows based PC using a particular version of the Sony Vegas Movie Studio software but you need to research which specific version does 3D .avi files because not all of them will. 9. Search on youtube for Fuji W3 to see videos others have made with the camera.Update: Used it on more vacations in different environments from Hawaii to Chicago during January. The camera always performs correctly. I have learned when filming in 3D stills or movie, keep a decent distance from the subject, it cannot do macro in 3D and must be at least a few feet away or when viewed the image pulls painfully at your eye muscles and is simply un-usable.

I must say the Fuji W3 has been a great step forward in reducing such complications.  A couple of examples:  1) I purchased a new Toshiba 3D laptop (A665-3D12x) to download and view my 3D video.  I wanted to be able to backup/view vacation photos while still away from home.  The Toshiba has the Nvidia 3D system integrated into the laptop.  I had no problem downloading the video to the computer from the SD card without any software and using the Nvidia players to watch in 3D.  The photo viewer was slow in switching back and forth between photo files - but it worked.  2) I also purchased new Panasonic 3D plasma (TC-P65GT30) to view 3D video from the Fugi and a new Panasonic 3D camcorder.I just got through watching the Fuji stills and video and they look great.  I connected the camera with a mini HDMI cord and it worked immediately with no problems.  The TV recognized the 3D and it played back without any fuss.  I should also point out the Fuji offers a slideshow that will playback both the video and stills - including a 2D to 3D fade which allows you to see the photos first as 2D, then 3D.  This is more important than it sounds because it saved a lot of pictures that I otherwise would have deleted because I covered the right lense with my finger.  As such the 3D was ruined, but the 2D (shot with the left lense) was still fine.  But it is this issue of the lense's placement near the shutter button that is the biggest drawback to the camera.  I realize it is my fault for taking so long to get in the habit of remembering there are two lenses, but it is way too easy to cover the lense.  It may be that you have to have a certain separation distance, but it would be great if they could get it away from the shutter.  The only other drawback is the lack of an AC/DC power source - you are dependent on the batteries even when playing back with the TV.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good 3D effect (especially with 3DTV), OK quality photos, poor video", "Author": "MiRSD", "ReviewID": "RXF91PUJY03HN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "(This review is from someone who has used \"Point & Shoot\" cameras through about 2006 before switching to a DSLR -- this is my first point & shoot since 2006. Despite this, I will try to keep in mind that this is a point and shoot and not make any direct comparisons to a DSLR as it's unrealistic to expect the same quality from this)After getting a 3DTV and trying to \"fake\" 3D pictures from 2D pictures, I realized I needed a \"real\" 3D Camera.. Of the choices, the Fuji seemed to be the best (the Sony bloggie seems to be all-manual and has the lenses too close.. the other Sony's use a single lens and are meant for swiping-panoramas, not static 3D images).First impressions - the camera looks good! Feels sturdy. I wouldn't drop it on purpose, but it feels like it would handle it a bit better than some other cameras.Battery and SD card go in on the bottom of the camera - my problem here is that the tripod socket is off to the side (not in the center), and any type of connector plugged into the tripod socket (an R-Strap connector, a tripod plate, a tripod, etc..) will prevent you from opening the battery/SD compartment.Battery life is pretty poor - the battery lasted about 100 pictures at most (with little flash use and no video). You will want to buy spares! The battery charges pretty quickly, but that's probably due to the lower capacity of it.The camera does not include any type of soft case. While most don't, this one seems like it needs one to protect the (very large!) LCD screen on the back. Definitely buy one with the camera.The camera fortunately has all sorts of modes - Manual, Full auto, Aperture priority.. a nice change from some \"only auto\" cameras.The 3D effect is very nice -- my biggest dissappointment is that you need to be about 3-4 feet away for it to \"work\" -- any closer and it just doesn't look right. With 3D, you usually want a \"pop out\" effect (same idea with a Fisheye lens) -- the fact your subject needs to stay that far away sort of limits what can be done. Macro mode does work for getting a little closer.The 3D screen is very nice and the photos look great on a 3DTV. If you don't own one, you're a little more limited on how  you can show them to people. The camera saves MPO files which will play back (in 3D) on a PS3 or you can buy a \"Mini HDMI to HDMI cable\" to connect the camera directly to the TV.The camera has the option to save photos in MPO (which is a 3D file) or MPO + JPEG. My complaint with the MPO + JPEG is it only saves 1 JPEG (great if you just want to upload a 2D image, but if you want both \"eyes\" in JPEG, you need to extract it from the MPO). I like to edit photos to add effects, and to do that I need to extract the JPEGs from an MPO (It would be nice if the camera saved both Left and Right JPEGs).I did not use the included software -- I used a free program called \"3D IMAGE MAKER\" which has a lot of control and lets you adjust the 3D effect, save as an MPO file, extract JPEGs from an MPO or save in other 3D filetypes (such as red/blue glasses in JPEG form).I was very disappointed in the Video quality - it's 720P High Definition but looks more like a webcam. Even compared to point and shoots, it's pretty bad.Image quality itself is \"OK\" - if you bought this as a 2D camera, you'd probably be disappointed as it doesn't hold up to other cameras.One other complaint is the flash - it's located between the 2 lenses, so objects in front of the camera will have a shadow on the left on one of the lenses, and a shadow on the right of the subject on the other lens - this creates a black outline around the subject. The Flash is also pretty poor and makes pictures look bad -- if possible, avoid it. If you have a \"Slave\" flash (like a Yongnuo YN-460), the built in flash WILL trigger it and you'll get much better results.Overall, what do I think?It's the best 3D camera out there -- it's also one of the only ones out there. The 3D effect is good though, especially if you have a 3DTV.If you plan to use it as a 2D camera, you'll probably be disappointed (especially with the video).Manual mode is nice and the camera does a good job at what it's made for. At the original price (500) it was pretty pricey. At it's current price (about half of that) it's a good \"fun\" camera.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great 3D, okay image quality, and one annoying design flaw", "Author": "Brent", "ReviewID": "R37HL7031POPV9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've used this camera for about a month, including a week-long vacation, so I've tried it quite a bit. The 3D works. The lenses are the right distance apart so it is good for middle-distance shots. It is harder to do super close-up stuff like you can with a 3D phone or Nintendo 3DS, which have the lenses close together. But it's better for things a meter or so away. If you want to see what pictures are like, go to 3dporch.com and click the link for this camera and you can see what others have uploaded.The image quality is okay but not great, although I found it much better once I set the ISO to 800 instead of the 1600 mine came set to. With 1600 everything looks very noisy. Again, look at 3dporch to see if it meets your needs.I sent back my first camera because I thought it was a faulty unit because the parallax adjuster slider was loose enough to slide around and click/rattle as the camera moved. This is obviously a problem if you are trying to record video and don't want clicking noises in it. However, after trying 3 units, I guess this is a design flaw. The workaround is to hold the switch in place with your finger while you are recording video. If you have an iPhone 4, then you already know about holding a device the right way to compensate for a glaring design flaw. Still, I love the camera. I only complain about this one flaw because of the hassle it caused me and Amazon and because it's inexcusably bad design. You shouldn't need to be told not to have a rattling part on a sound-recording device.I do recommend this for anyone who wants to do some 3D photography. You do get more spatial depth to your photos, which is really cool and sometimes really makes the picture more interesting/understandable.

Then another feature that stitches the two files together into a single stereoscopic avi file.  The problem then is when I use VLC to play the new stereoscopic file, it activates two movies at once -but gives you no way to fix the size or the placement of both images.I will wait until I upgrade to a full 3D TV and use the composite signal, which will give a much larger movie anyway.Until then, I will watch the 3D movies on the camera viewer.Since I bought the camera, I bought the new Samsung UN55D8000 3D LED TV.  It displays all formats captured by the camera - except 3D movies.  The problem appears to be that the 3D movie format used by Fujifilm is an avi that contains two image streams.Samsung does not yet appear to have a VLC server embedded in the TV software that can handle this format.Until then, I am investigating a work around, which may have to included reformatting the 3D movie streams into another 3D protocol on the computer, before sending it to the TV.I finally worked out how to display my home-made 3D movies on my Samsung 3D TV.It beats me as to why neither Samsung, nor Fujifilm seemed to have a clue how to convert the Fujifilm 3D movie into a generic format for Samsung.At any rate you must download two utilities (both free).1) StereoMovie Maker at  [...]2) Neo3D from [...]You only need to download the trial version of Neo3D because it will conveniently install a good mjpg codec which is hard to get or pricy.

I think this camera makes taking 3D pictures about as easy as possible but users have to be aware that adding the third dimension makes picture taking more complex and no camera is going to be able to eliminate that. The manual could perhaps be better written but I found that taking the time to read it carefully while trying out all the features was very worth while. The point and shoot auto setting will be OK in many situations but because of the extra dimension it is easier for it to fail than 2D point and shoots. You have to take the time to experiment and get a feel for composing 3D shots or you will be disappointed in the results with this camera compared to most other point and shoot cameras. The advanced 3D setting takes some practice to get used to and requires a stationary subject to work well but this is unavoidable because you can only get so much parallax out of a camera this size and when you need more you have no choice but to move the camera and take a second shot. However, if you have the patience you can get some very nice shots this way. It would have been nice to be able to move the lenses closer together for close-up 3D shots but you can still do well using the macro with the advanced 3D setting and moving the camera a small amount.

The biggest selling point on the Fuji FinePix 3d W3 for me is that it does have TWO separate lens and Two separate sensors.  Very important to me, unlike many camera manufacturers jumping in on the 3D market saying that their beam splitting, phase splitting gizmos onto 1 shared sensor has the same performance.  I don't think so.  In addition, when you take a 3D image you have a 2D jpeg any way.  Or, take a tele and a wide angle shot at the same time, or with different ISO setting.  Very interesting camera with unique modes unlike any other camera readily available to me.The large 3.5 Parallax Barrier LCD does allow you to preview your 3D shot before you take it and for play back.  Unfortunately, after that you'll need \"more\" 3D investment to view you images.  Expensive 3D HD monitors, 3D HD T.V's or lenticular(sp) prints.  However, on your the computer in the Fuji FinePix Studio you can still rely upon creating anaglyphs where you need the red/blue glasses or side by side where you'll need a relatively inexpensive viewing apparatus.Actually, I knew that I would be relying upon red/blue anaglyphs for my usage.  Instead of cheap cardboard frame glasses which will work, I bought a very expensive sunglasses type for $5 which are great.  Something magical about a image that's scrambled with red/blue lines that snap into a great 3D image with the glasses.Major problem is that certain colors such as reds are viewed incorrectly as violet-blue-gray, but greens, blues, yellows and greys usually look normal.Access into the menu's sometimes is odd or slow.  In manual mode, one must access the menu, then the sub-menu to change shutter or aperture setting.  ISO setting in manual mode allows one to set at ISO 100 which gives great pictures.  In the Auto mode, the lowest ISO automatically set at ISO 400, not a great image maker then.  You need to set in each different mode your preferences such as ISO.I do love the 3D ability this camera gives me.

I'll admit, it took a little courage to spend the $300+ I spent on this camera amidst the storm of frustrated users who don't know what they are doing, and actual bad products. I can assure you this 3D camera should be set aside from both of those cases. It is absolutely an exception that cannot be ignored.I love this camera. It isn't the most advanced thing on the market, I'll admit. But it basically has two 10 megapixel (industry standard) cameras built into it and the quality of the pictures is really no worse than any other standard 10 megapixel camera you might buy. BUT--when images are viewed in 3D, the quality seems even better. Consider that, in 3D, you see more detail than in 2D pictures.The 3D effect is very pronounced. Sometimes, the camera has trouble judging the proper spacing between the two images (often due to low light, certain objects in the picture, etc) and causes pictures to come out difficult to see. This is fine--After you take the shots, you can adjust the L/R image separation and fix the effect so that it is corrected.The camera takes pictures in three formats: Jpeg (2D), MPO (3D) and Avi (side-by side 3D video, or normal video). MPO is no more than two JPG images packed in together as one file (like JPS) and **is the same format used by the Nintendo 3DS** for 3D photos (you will need to re-name the pictures for this to work on 3DS). However, due to the fact that 3D technology is not *yet* prevalent on the market, there are many formats (jpg files with L and R images side-by-side; JPS, which is almost identical to MPO; 3D MP4 videos; and one based on PNG images)... You will need to obtain a program like the free stereo photo creator software to convert your pictures to these other formats so that they will work on things like 3D photo frames and such (which also get ridiculous, bad reviews because people don't understand this.)Also, understand that taking 3D photos is different from taking normal photos. That third dimension requires attention when setting up a shot! Taking a picture of an object far away (flying aircraft) will not have as good an effect as a shot with things in all fields of depth (your friends in the school library). The camera can be set to 2D for standard picture taking as well.The one problem. Yes, there is but one. The battery life is about an hour. Buy extra batteries and have them on-hand! (they can be bought here for about $3 a piece if you look, rather inexpensive.)No 3D view monitors... Yeah, that is a bit of an issue of practicality, but not an issue with the camera. All pictures taken with the camera can be converted to Red/Cyan, etc. glasses pictures via free software obtainable on the internet, or viewed as such via Nvidia graphics card software. The effect is just as good, either way. Have a 120 Hz monitor? Even better. These pics can be viewed on those using the appropriate glasses.

Isn't 3D a gimmick? Well, yes it is, but it is an interesting and fun gimmick, and a refreshing way to view the world through photography and share that view with others.I picked up a W3 for those reasons, not as a replacement for my dSLRs but as an alternative. I travel a lot for business and wanted to document the various destinations around the world uniquely with still images and movies... and then share them with my family and friends around my Samsung 58\" 3D Plasma HDTV. Why not a W3?What have I found out about 3D photography? It does make you look at the world differently. You've got to fit your scene in the viewfinder, and if you want the 3D look you have to carefully consider the content from near to far; the 3D effect is greatly diminished when all of the scenic elements are a long way from the camera. However, images and scenes that might otherwise be somewhat ordinary become much more interesting in 3D. Something like an ordinary image of a crowded sidewalk jumps to life in 3D because the visual separation is especially powerful. Maybe the people behind the Viewmaster were on to something. Speaking of Viewmaster, you can get 3D reels AND Viewmasters to show and share your photos here: [...]. Or you can view your 3D stills and movies on your 3D HDTV via a mini-HDMI-to-HDMI cable such as this Menotek Gold Plated 6FT HDMI To Mini HDMI Cable. Note that the 3D movies can also be watched over a network connection or a USB flash drive attached to the 3D TV (with your 3D glasses on), as can the MPO images. Of course, the W3 can capture 2D photos and videos, and you can also capture 2D and 3D images simultaneously (the 2D image is the image from the left camera, or you can use the supplied Fuji software to extract either the left or right image as a JPEG from the MPO 2-image 3D file).How does the W3 play in the world of 3D photography? It's certainly the easiest way to take a 3D image or movie, by far. The only major issue I have with the camera itself is an ergonomic one; you will almost certainly leave a finger in front of one lens or the other until you get into the habit of holding the camera by its edges and carefully checking the viewfinder. The camera itself is a little slower to come up to speed than most of today's digicams on power-on, most likely due to the fact that it's really two separate camera systems that have to start up and then integrate with each other. There's also perceptible shutter lag; if you want to take action shots you will need to pan with the subject while pressing the shutter and follow through to get the shot you want.You will also need a high-speed SD card if you plan to take video; ordinary cards will not be able to keep up with the video stream and movie recording will shut off after around 15 seconds because the camera's internal buffers get full. You will need at least a Class 6 (30 MB/sec) card. I've picked up a couple of SanDisk 8GB Extreme SDHC Class 10 cards. And, you will want at least one extra battery because the W3 is a power hog... probably again because it's really two integrated camera systems in one. The Kodak KLIC-7004 / Fuji Np-50  equivalent Li-Ion Battery is as good as any and at a good price: .Finally, the camera doesn't come with a case. I like the Lowepro Rezo 50.

The audio quality when recording video is amazing.  Two forward aiming mikes record and save uncompressed PCM 48khz stereo regardless of the video resolution.  I first discovered how good it was when recording wildlife at night.  Upon playback over a good surround system you could hear all the sounds of summer like you were actually in the woods.  Also the video file formats which the video is saved are universal \"AVI\"  which means you can copy and play it anywhere in 2D without needing to use any special software.  The file compatible options also extends to still shots as they separately save in both  2D standard JPEG and the special 3D MPO files.  As everyone else has said here, the 3D effect is outstanding.  The few times I've taken this camera to public places I've got a \"wow\" from everyone I've shown it too.  Truly impressive.Sadly this camera has some problems as well.  Top of the list is \"hot-stuck-bad\" pixels that show up during video recordings.  While the camera's firmware apparently cleans this up on still photos, I have had to return 2 FinePix W3's that record bright defective pixels while filming video.  I have posted a sample to this review.  It's amazing this gets by Fujifilm's quality control.  This is the first time in 10 years I have had to return a digital or LCD type product because of bad pixels. Really disappointing.  Generally the camera's 10-megapixel CCD sensors have exceptionally good light sensitivity but with that comes noticeably high levels of image noise.  The trick to getting good pictures with the FinPix W3 is to drop the ISO setting to 400 or less and use the FinepixColor \"chrome\" setting.  In low light, opt for the flash before bumping that ISO up.  While not equal to the quality of my Lumix DMC-ZS3, the results of the FinePix W3, when coaxed, can be quite satisfying.As I write this, I am ordering a third FinePix W3 in the hope of finally getting one that is free of bad pixels when filming video.  A friend of mine has a FinePix W3 that is pixel-defect free so I know a good unit must exist for me out there, somewhere.", "Date": "August 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "3D is awesome!", "Author": "L. wen", "ReviewID": "RY8QCBP8XOPIR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "3D is awesome!

I especially like the instant 3D review possible on the very large display in the back, which upon first looking into appears like a magical hole in the back of the camera (and which gives some people I show it to an instant of vertigo).One annoyance is the double shadow effect you get with indoors flash, but there's probably no help for that since with two lenses you actually do get two different views of the shadow. With normal eyes it's gone so fast that there is no time to notice but in a still shot hangs there quite oddly robbing the otherwise striking reality. Much is the same should you happen to catch a bird in flight. Seeing a bird just hang in the air is so UN-real as to sort of spoil the 3D effect. Otherwise though, I am liking it very well.Panasonic, I note, has a competitor 3D camera which has 4X optical zoom over the Fuji W3's 3X. While that might be nice I also note that the spacing on the Panasonic's dual lenses is very much closer than the Fuji W3's own (which looks to be exactly equal to normal human eye spacing). So, although I've not tied one out, I cannot help but to think that the Panasonic's 3D effect would be less, possibly akin to how a gnome or elf might see things (still in 3D but by not so much). Probably though, that closer spacing might have worked better when I had tried to focus upon a caterpiller upon a leaf. Still and all, had I bothered to study the advance features I might have dealt better with that.Also, there is a kind of advanced fine-tuning you can do to better perfect the alignment of the two lenses which I've not bothered with yet. So I'm just using the default factory alignment (which looks plenty good to me).My favorite thing about the competitor Panasonic is that it appears to have urged Fuji to lower its price for the W3 by 75% down to under $200 (the Panasonic 3D camera's price). I'm sure what Fuji is holding out for is that I'll break down and shell out $495 for their way cool, large size 3D, hand held viewer.

That's OK -- it's just a matter of setting each mode the way you want it and just leave it there.One of the main features I'll never use is the ability to take a 2D picture. It's a 3D camera, after all -- so why not take pictures in 3D? You can always view any 3D pix in 2D if you want. One setting I've chosen is to save all images in both MPO (3D) format as well as JPG. This ensures I can easily do anything I want with the pix I take.The 3D view screen is amazing. You can actually look at pictures in 3D right on the camera. One drawback is that the screen can be hard to see in bright sunlight. But that's typical of any camera using a view screen instead of an optical viewfinder.Oh, and this camera takes VIDEOS in 3D. They are limited to 720p, but they look amazing!Zoom range is from an effective 35mm to 140mm. I wish it went to 28mm, but the 35mm focal length more closely approximates normal human vision, so is perfect for most 3D shots. It should be noted that even if the lens would zoom to 300mm, such extreme-telephoto focal-lengths do not yield meaningful 3D images. I find I shoot most pictures at the 35mm setting.Some reviewers reported that images are a bit soft. In my experience, this is not true. Those who wrote this probably had their camera set to a small image size. Set to its full 10 megapixel image size, the pictures are beautiful. This camera does a GREAT job of adjusting auto-exposure and white-balance -- better than either my Sony pocket camera or my Nikon SLR.The camera has internal memory sufficient to take six 10-megapixel photos. So be sure to order memory cards. The price on memory cards has really dropped.  SanDisk Ultra Class Memory SDSDH 016G U46I've tried a bunch of 'click & move' 3D pix of the type I've taken for years with standard cameras. The issue with 'click & move' has always been that it's tricky to get both images framed identically. Also, depending upon how far you move between the two images, items in the foreground may not be viewable in 3D. This camera also offers a version of 'click & move' based upon a timed interval between the two pictures. The timed mode should be PERFECT for shooting from an airplane, where there are no objects in the immediate foreground.Bottom line is I love it!

Fuji really thought this product out well and allows you to view you images on a 3D TV, get reticulated prints (kind of expensive, though) and most importantly, shoot real 3D Video that you can watch on your 3D TV.  As a 3D hobbiest, I've been shooting with stereo film cameras for many years, and the software included with the camera lets you produce separate print images if you wish to make 3D prints for use in a 3D viewer.  Separate prints and a viewer are much more detailed than reticulated prints or watching on TV.  The camera also shoots single shots and has some unusual features such as shooting separate shots with each camera with different zoom settings or flash/no flash.  Although not cheap, the camera, lenses and imagers are of good quality and the camera produces prints at least as good as other Fujifilm point and shoot digitals, while do some things no other camera can do.  As with any 3D camera, this one really can't do macro shots well, which requires a special camera with lenses much closer together, but for subjects at typical point and shoot distance, it does a great job.  Video is pretty good too, but the nature of the camera limits the sound quality and clip times are a bit short, but these are not shortcomings that should be of concern given the reasonable price.  If you want to have fun shooting pictures again, this is the camera to get.As the last word, the only other 3D camera with sufficient digital resolution to make good images has a stereo base separation of only 25mm, which is good for macro/close up shooting but useless for most 3D shooting.

Fuji UK offers two sizes.  The problem with the Fuji product, is the translucent nature of the materials used.  \"Back in the days\", I mean the Nimslo period, 3D prints were only produced on opaque white paper, with the lenticular lens sheet laminated on it.  Fuji's process prints right to the backside of the lens sheet, and without a light box or holding the print to a window to get back light, the images are dull - no way to be compared to a 3D TV or 3D monitor view (Nimslo prints didn't compare with that, either).  There are now a few firms offering to make single prints on paper with lens affixed, and in many sizes.  Try Snapily, Snap3D, Start3D (which lets you generate \"in-between\" images for better results prior to ordering), Zaxisprints, and LaDair.  You have to choose between handmade and mass produced product - simply making a lenticular print from the two images Fuji cameras produce, results in a \"flat\" 3D effect.  If you can have the \"in-between\" images developed, then when you rotate your lenticular print as you view it, you can sense roundness and some thickness in the bodies and items in the pictures.  You get what you pay for.As far as the camera itself is concerned, I've had issues with the lenses not being paired very well - different quality between the two images in the pair - while the quality of the device (from an operating standpoint) and the image quality is acceptable, the left image is poorer on my particular device - especially on the sides.

The Real 3D has a wide screen LCD screen which displays a 3D image when in 3D mode with no glasses. The camera has Aperture, Manual, and Program Mode controls. Aperture goes from f/3.7 to f/8; shutter speeds go 1/2 to 1/500 seconds. To adjust the controls one has to press the menu/ok button and then press aperture or whatever in the menu to make exposure adjustment; one has to do this for every exposure change which becomes a bit of a pain. The frustrating part of the system is the My FinePix Studio/See Here software. You can adjust 2D exposures and cropping, but not 3D. This became a problem when ordering prints. Since the 3D prints are printed in the 35mm format instead of the wide screen format of the camera's LCD viewscreen, the prints were cropped in all the wrong places (You can't make corrections for FujiFilm's 3D file, MPO., format in Photoshop). This can get very expensive. Luckly and belatedly, I discovered that the 3D images can be cropped in the camera with the \"Image Size\" setting ( \"L\" 4:3 1065 setting) and the \"Crop\" setting (I should have read the manual and fooled around with the buttons before deleting the images on my SD card!). The 3D images can be viewed on a non-3D monitor with those red/blue glasses or on a 3D monitor with those special 3D glasses.

If you have a 3DHDTV you can plug this right in and view.  If you want to feed the images through your computer using freeware you can tweek each image to peak the stills or edit and reformat movies (Stereo Photo Maker and Stereo Movie Maker.It is true that the camera's low light performance is a bit grainy at night.  Again, this is a pocket camera and does not have large lenses and is smaller than more expensive video cameras.  It is possible to use a pair of some Canon cameras and make your own system that is not as simple, has better lenses, produces better images, requires that you build it yourself, and reprogram (using Stereo Data Maker) and wire the cameras.  It is worth doing if stereo photography is your passion.  I use both.The Fuji shoots true progressive video.  Most inexpensive video cameras use rolling shutters that need to be tightly synchronize.  Rolling shutters create distorted images if the camera(s) are not stablized and sychronized.  Fuji really thought this one through.  The release of the Fuji W1 created a group of serious enthusiasts seeking film like performance.  Fuji sought their feedback with active participation on the yahoo photo3d blog, and there is now a Fuji stereo blog on Yahoo as well.There are features in this camera that allow 3D macro stills and hyperstereo photos.  If you want to take such photos this is all that you need.  If you want to spend more and shoot videos then Sony, JVC, and Panasonic all have some attractive units.  But even if you had one of those, or a SDM Canon rig, you would probaly still want one of these.

I've dabbled in 3D photography for several years. But despite that, 3D has always been a novelty. I thought making \"cross-eyed\" 3D photos looked cool, but otherwise were completely impractical for other than a quick jolt of fun. Anaglyphs look terrible to me, although I've made quite a few myself, just for the fun of it. Watching Jaws 3D in the theatre as a kid was fun...but looked like crap.Until now, I've had no interest in a 3D TV. The only reason to get one seemed to be to watch Avatar...a movie I could care less about...and have no desire to even watch.I've spent lots of money on 3D camera attachments and glasses and all that garbage...all of which which collects dust in my junk box.Then on a crazy whim I bought the W3.As a videographer and film-maker wannabe, 24p kinda sealed the deal for me. Unlike others who complain about the \"stuttery\" video that the 24p W3 makes, 24p is the ultimate (only) desired format for a video camera when it comes to my work. Other frame rates are just \"home video\"...made to cope with shaky handheld video. 24p gives you the look of a real movie...when shot correctly with a tripod (or professional steadicam) and experienced camera movement techniques.Without a 3DTV, the small price for this camera earned its price right out of the box after taking 3 quick snapshots and viewing it on the built in 3.5\" \"parallax barrier\" LCD which doesn't require special glasses. Yep...just like the hype says...you get AMAZING 3D photos/video right on the camera's LCD...WITHOUT glasses of any kind! That's the WOW factor!The camera is very straightforward to use. Extra batteries are cheap, generic ones are even cheaper...if that's an issue. Shooting in manual mode can really improve your work...just like on any camera...whether pro or consumer. Built quality is excellent. You'll need to shade the LCD when shooting outdoors, to see what you're shooting. (You're probably not shooting the next Hollywood 3D blockbuster with it, but you at least want to get your framing right. It is a \"point and shoot\" after all.)CON: Now I want a 3DTV. Darn you Amazon Prime...a 54\" 3D Panny Viera will be on the way soon...to replace my perfectly awesome 2D Sceptre big TV. There goes two months of rent money. (I'm not a \"latest and greatest\" tech-geek...I'm an older classic film-lover.)Even if you're a prosumer camera user, you'll benefit from the fact that this camera is basically two CCD cameras (no rolling CMOS shutter) in one...instead of an image splitter that more expensive cameras use on a single sensor.The LCD alone is worth the small price tag.I'm using it with a Transcend 32gb Class 10 SDHC card. I only use Sandisk for my pro work, but Transcends are SUPER affordable for my home video stuff. Works great.If they come out with parallax battier \"no glasses\" TV's similar to the LCD on the W3 soon for a reasonable price, that will be insanely amazing. I'm just not sure I can wait that long...I want to watch my W3 videos on the big screen...without converting them to crappy anaglyph movies!!Absolutely the coolest \"novelty\" I've laid out a bunch of cash on in a long time...NO regrets!!(My girlfriend hates nerdy/techy junk even more than me...and she was even jaw-dropped after my first few pics/videos shot in our dark loft...2 minutes after I opened the box!!)Wow.Another Con: They'll probably release a W4 next month...since I bought the W3. :D", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Cool: high quality 3D , mediocre 2D", "Author": "Jason, Engineer, Gadget nut, Father of 3", "ReviewID": "RZGPW9RXWCOJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own this camera and the 3D photographs that I have taken show amazing depth and 3D effect on the built in 3D display.

When I got all the settings perfect, the video is stunning -- but it takes a lot of effort to create the ideal settings because it's not just the camera, it's the environment you are shooting and subject you want in focus -- this all takes work to get right.

I stumbled upon this camera by accident (it was on sale and I couldn't resist) and learned so much from the other reviews that I wanted to contribute something back.My main goal with this camera is to use as another weapon in my over-documentation of everything in the lives of my young children. To that end, this camera is fantastic, and now is my main medium for outdoor shots, and for 3D movies when they are doing something active. All the other great pieces of advice are covered already by the other reviewers, but I would add two things. One would be to set up a shot with more than just a \"near\", \"middle\", and \"far\" (or background) element, as it can come out looking fake, sort of like cardboard stand-ups at these different focal planes. If you can somehow include something (wall, table, even the ground) as a form of continuity stretching back into the distance, it then creates a more believable sense of depth to the picture. My other tidbit revolves around trying to find the minimum requirements for the SDHC memory card, especially when shooting 3D movies. At the highest resolution, a 16gb card holds just over 40 minutes. The manual states minimum class 6 card, but Sandisk Ultra class 4 SDHC cards work, allowing me piece of mind with the Sandisk brand, and saving me some money in not buying a higher specification card if I do not need to.Bottom line, I whole-heartedly recommend this Fujifilm W3 3D camera and I totally agree with the jaw-dropping and WOW! factor of what it offers in such a convenient package.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Exceeded my already high expectations", "Author": "Cole Fuller", "ReviewID": "R1IT74P55ELMGP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought a 3DTV last month and have become 3D addicts.

If you have 3D skeptics and scoffers in your life or you just want to add to your currently limited 3D options, I highly recommmend this camera.A few things I want to cover from reviews that I have read:We were excited to review the pictures we took on the nice-sized LCD display in full 3D without the use of glasses and we were not disappointed! This is, in my opinion, the biggest WOW of the camera. The size of the screen is equivalent to the display on the iPod Touch and while, yes, you need to look at the screen from the right angle, the 3D JUMPS out of the camera. Showing off your 3D photos from your camera is sure to leave people astonished and trying to grab the images.My experience with battery life is similar to what I've been reading...I definitely suggest ordering a backup.Macro shots...there have been mixed reviews on this. My experience, at first, was disappointment. I immediately wanted to take up close shots of everything, but the crosstalk or \"ghosting\" was at an eye-straining level. However, upon using the advanced 3D settings and a couple of tries, I find the Macro shots to really impress! I find myself gathering up things to shoot and with a little trial and error, I'm already (one day later) close to having this mastered.I agree that the best shots are taken from further away. Taking pictures from above your subject really shows off the 3D and the depth of your pictures. I took a shot of a tall vase from above and when I showed it to someone, they said it looked like the vase was sitting on the LCD screen.On the TV, I have not been extremely impressed, but I am hoping it will take some learning as well. The convergence seems to differ too much from the camera to the tv. That said, I took some shots of a sculpture park in my city while it was snowing and the depth is impressive. It looks like snow is coming out of my tv screen.I have only played around with the video so far...it's gonna take some practice. A lot of crosstalk as of yet, but I anticipate that once I learn to effectively utilize it, it will be a fun feature as well.I'm looking forward to ordering prints and I'm planning on getting a 3D digital frame to showcase the amazing shots I've taken.If you are a 3D fanatic and enthusiast, I really think the Fujifilm FinePix Real 3D W3 cameran is sure to please!", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very impressive and user friendly directly from box.", "Author": "Junk Rocker", "ReviewID": "RO2XS3RJNEQRT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For an early entry into this still burgeoning technology of consumer 3D cameras..

Using the lenticular screen kind'a makes the close objects look \"funny\" in that the two images required for the 3D effect are widely different sizes.  Close one eye and the close image is big, close the other and the close image looks considerably smaller.  Open both eyes and the close image kind'a looks funny and hard to focus on.  So, it's a matter of learning how to frame the shots, and playing with the \"parallax\" control to adjust the shots based on your desired emphasis, field depth, to achieve what you want..I used to take 3D using the two-picture method -- by taking two pictures at two different positions.  This works great for stationary objects. But this now means that I can capture action.

I can't wait to see what the (rather expensive, at $6.99 each) prints look like. I can't afford a 3D TV yet, but at least I can take some 3D shots and video (also very impressive on the screen, since you don't need special glasses for the 3D effect) while the kids are young, and get a 3D TV after prices come down. I haven't tried all the various settings yet; the 2D shots are OK, I like my Canon Powershot SX200 IS better for that. The battery life is quite short, probably less than 1 hour, and I had a problem with video recording shutting off after 4 minutes or so. I later read not formatting the card can cause this, I'm going to try it later. the 3D files (.MPO) are really just 2 jpg files stored together, but only the Fuji software will download them so far: iPhoto and Picasa won't. I should get a card reader, but I've always found it easier to connect a cable to the camera for downloading. I'd love to have an option of another place to get prints from, but I'm sure that'll happen sooner or later. Bottom line, if you like 3D, you'll love this camera!", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Bad night photos ...

Others have said enough about it.I want to tell you what the manufacturer doesn't. On the face of it, the camera allows you to take 3D photos and movies that you can view on the camera screen or on a 3D TV. You can also order 3D prints through their service. But there's more you can do.First off, you need to know that Fujifilm's included software doesn't allow you to do anything special, which is fine because if you have a Mac, you won't be able to install the software anyway: it's so old it was written for Power PC and newer Intel Macs can't run it. There's no updated Mac software on Fujifilm's site.There are two things you can do that are pretty cool. One is to convert your 3D photos into anaglyphic 3D (uses those red/blue 3D glasses). You can also print out left/right images to use in stereo viewers.There's a Windows-only program called StereoPhoto Maker that looks pretty cool. It's free open-source software that will let you open your MPO files and convert it to anaglyphic photos and many other formats.Mac users have two choices. One is to get Parallels or other Windows virtualization software and run Windows on your Mac to use StereoPhoto Maker. The other option is to use a free program called Stereo Splicer. Search for Stereo Splicer Interim because there are many links to this program that are wrong.The main difference between the two applications are that StereoPhoto Maker can align the blue and red images automatically.Once you have the process of creating anaglyphic images down, you can buy a bunch of cardboard 3D glasses cheap and mail them to your friends and family. Then you can publish your 3D images online and share them, or print them, instead of having to spend $7 each for a bunch of 5x7 3D prints.This camera has reconnected me with the love of 3D that I had when I was a kid, for things like 3D comic books and Viewmasters.Now, the cons. The camera is designed in such a way that you will need to train yourself to hold it so you don't get your fingers into the shot. This will take some doing. Also, I wish the lens was a bit wider.If you are thinking of buying this camera, just walking up to a friend, taking their photo (without telling them it's 3D), and then showing them the image on the screen will provoke an astonished reaction that will justify every dollar you spent.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pictures look great on a 3D TV", "Author": "Don", "ReviewID": "R20M546QDXJIG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for some time and converted the images to anaglyph (red & blue glasses) to view on my computer.

With still images it also requires good light and at least a steady hand.As a 3D beginner camera though it is hard to beat for the price. Once you become accustomed to taking 3D pictures and videos you may want to spend big money on more advanced cameras, but for the beginner, this is a great camera. Just be sure to take multiple pictures, because not all of them will turn out with the right 3D effect, but when they do, the results are like being there. With 3D pictures and videos, you don't watch or look at them like in 2D, but rather you experience them all over again in 3D. And the bigger the 3D screen you display them on the better the expereince.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "3D Camera", "Author": "Dan Ellerbusch", "ReviewID": "R19G048W4VTUJ0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good, but needs a different aspect ratio to print 4 x 6 photos for a stereoscope.

I'm using the W3 on a tripod and for maximum stability and picture quality I'd like to use a remote for this project.3) Doesn't save pictures as a .jpeg - The W3 saves its picture files as .mpo files.

While it isn't the best digital camera I have ever owned  with regards to picture quality. It is the first and only 3D camera I have ever owned.Having spent years doing the manual \"side by side\" digital stereographic method. I was never happy that I could not get \"into the action\" with stereo photography. While some other new digital cameras offer this feature, unless you have two physical lenses on your camera, there is no way to \"catch the action\" of moving objects. This camera is amazing for that.The camera does have fully automatic modes, where you can control the ISO, aperture, and shutter speed. While limited to just a few choices for each, it is nice that Fuji thought of the \"pro-sumer\" market adding three different manual modes. It took me a few days of walking through different lighting conditions, and times of day to really get my first truly well balanced photo. Sometimes the amount of shooting options are a bit overwhelming.Not only are there three preprogrammed fully manual spots on the selection wheel. There are also two blank spots for special programs as well. One for 2D and one for 3D. I really was quite shocked at the flexibility as a trained photographer.The only reason I removed one star was for its video function. There is no settings for video, and there could be. This camera uses a new format of mjpeg for video. Which is a series of images, isn't video just that anyway. But if Fiji would have found a way to tie in your various still photo settings, into the video settings, I would be four stars all the way.So of course the video is great for overcast and cloudy days.

(2)  the Flash is not strong enough and you can't connect an external flash. so even indoors, you will need to provide more light. of course more ISO, more grain.  (3) camera must be 4.5 ft from the subject minimum and the more clutter there is surrounding the subject, the better the 3D effect.  (4) It is not jump-at-you 3D but rather, put-your-hand-into-the-picture 3D.  if you have to be 5 ft from the subject, the 3D occurs INTO the photo, not out of.  hollywood 3D that jumps at you require much more 3D calculations and changes in convergence distances, variety of alignments, etc. (5) 2D photos are as good and clear as any point and shoot.  1/2.3\" ccd chip.  (6) the camera has an option that takes 2 pictures in a row, one with flash and one with out.  This was a pretty cool feature.Video Quality - (1) Although the 3D effect is still great, with good depths, (assuming you have lots of clutter around the subject), the final quality is poor and not HD. rather a 1280x720 is split so you can only get a video that is somewhat pixelated: 1280x720 is actualy 640 stretched by 720.  (2) You can't shoot HD videos for more than 1 min unless you're using a class10 SD card.  Class 6 wouldn't let me shoot more than a minute per clip.  (3) HD clips are 11mins before it cuts, saves for 15 secs. before being able to use the camera again.  thus, a camcorder will be needed to do real videos.User Friendly - (1) most point and shoots play when you press the center button of the circle.  here, the play button is the down button of the circle.  (2) after taking a picture, it doesn't go back to camera mode, unless you press some other button.  After taking a picture, it remains on the preview and tells you to press \"ok\" to continue. (3)  On is open the lens. to turn off, close the lens.  So when you want to show your friends the awesome 3D glassless LCD, the lens have to be open and people can get their fingers in the lens. (4) heavy compared to for example Canon s95 or other point and shoots.  other reviews i read said that just ONE drop and it will malfunction. I was hoping the weight was some sort of cushion, but i'm not going to try to find out.Instruction Manual - didn't have anything new that i couldn't figure out. but then again, i've been using lots of cameras and figured out most things by experimenting.  I just used it to confirm my findings.Software - there is no software.  the cd only organizes files.  it doesn't let you do any sort of editing. none.  i removed it and installed magix movie edit pro plus 17 instead.Overall - as a point an shoot, the 3D depth and results are a totally fun experience.  compared to another point and shoot I have with a 1/2.6\" sensor, indoors, my 1/2.6\" performed better in lowlight. Buttons and video are tricky. HD requires class10 and is not full HD.  it is also pixelated.  for a 3D point and shoot, it does it's job. it's not a professional camera nor camcorder, so will not factor those in to my ratings.

Anderson \"A. Lotta Stuff\"", "ReviewID": "RBUJBGXKQ82MN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "(The review is mainly directed at the uninitiated to \"glassless\" 3D technology.) I had a chance to play with this camera at the Narita Airport few days ago. Here are some observations regarding this, and other 3D technology currently on the market. Full disclosure- I didn't buy the camera, but only can report on my initial impressions. I have since done some research so I'm familiar with the camera's capability.  Also, I am a long-time 3D enthusiast who is NOT easily impressed. Bottom line- the display on the back of the camera is really impressive. The camera was loaded with a demo video (source?) showing some whitewater rafting, and it had an amazing 3D effect that was as natural as you could get on a 3.5\" screen. For those not familiar with 2-image lenticular (which is the mode of this display), there is a \"sweet spot\" for viewing the 3D image. This means that when you are looking at the 3D display, a friend standing next to you won't be able to see the effect until you hand them the camera. I didn't see any still 3D photos on the camera, but there was a Fuji 3D photo frame (new?) also on display. This was also loaded with some demo images, but was definitely not as impressive. This may have had everything to do with the demo images themselves, not the frame. The lenticular grid was apparent, and while the 3D effect was as expected, the resolution of the demo images detracted from the experience. Not so with the display on this camera, although at 3.5\", most high res output going to look good. Still, the 3D effect was remarkable, and I've seen a lot of 3D output. There are many niches to the 3D world. Despite what a recent reviewer posited, 3D photography is not new, it's been around for as long as there has been photography and there are some ardent and enthusiastic practitioners from film to digital to video. I personally have been underwhelmed by most 3D output. Yes, I did say that I was an enthusiast. My particular expertise is in historical stereoscopic images. Most modern lenticular photographs I've seen from the film era just look gimicky and sometimes downright strange- I can't put my finger on it, but it has a lot to do with quest for the visual \"pop\" that leads to an excessive 3D effect, (the extreme is called hyperstereo) which is unnatural. A lot has to do with subject matter, too.  How many close-ups of flowers do you have to see, or children at a birthday party blowing noisemakers directly into the lens before you never want to look at another 3D print again?  Not all, but many pictures I've seen in the past suffered from these sins. The culprit is usually that the images are taken at a separation greater than the natural distance between the human eyes. Even a few extra mm can have a displeasing effect. (The Fuji is a little wider than the average eye separation, but not bad.)I've watched some demo video, too, on some of the newer 3D TV's out there, and while the first impression has been initially  good, I quickly move to the \"I can still live without it\" stage. It's maybe a combination of again, a (mildly) excessive 3D effect meant to grab your attention, and the limits of the glasses. Most reviewers of Avatar said the 3D effect was so unobtrusive that they forgot they were watching a 3D movie. I don't know if that is an endorsement of \"natural\" 3D or not, but it is a point for further discussion. Sports, I'll grant , do look great in 3D.  That being said, I would like to see the output of this camera on a high-quality large screen before I pass final judgement on how essential this technology is for me at this price point. I think there is room for improvement in the 3D arena (long time 3D enthusiasts know what I mean) so we'll just have to wait.

The magic of seeing my first viewmaster reel to the modern technology of 3D television sets has constantly tickled the visual senses.The 3D shoot-sway-shoot dance has nothing on this beauty! It's a camera with two eyes! I've got two eyes! You've got two eyes! Seeing with one eye is like trying to view the world through the eye of a cylon or a cyclops so why would you settle for just one lens? The benefit of having two lenses bears itself in two ways - depth of field and motion.When using the 3D photography apps on a smart phone or with a digital SLR, you quickly discover that the 3D effect comes from taking two pictures at approximately 6 to 10 centimeters (2.5 to 4 inches) apart in a sidewards step, without panning. In the time it takes for you to shift into the second shot, the wind could have changed the scene or the child likely shifted position, or even more problematic, the camera refocused at a different distance. The images no longer align and you don't get the 3D result you wanted. Taking both pictures instantly remedies this problem ... but if you're desperate to do the side-step dance, the camera has a setting that allows it.Even more amazing is that this camera can take 3D video!

OK, this camera is a good start because you first have to take 3d pics. It does a good job of that and really cool because you can see them on the screen display right after you take them! Very impressive and you have to learn what kind of shots and distances make for good 3d.

While the camera(s) ARE 10 megapixels, the camera does not have a very good image stabilizer (if that's what it's called). In effect, in order to get good shots, you need to use a tripod or brace it on something to reduce the motion of your hands. If you want to get better 2D shots, don't rely on the camera to use the left image of a 3D shot. For some reason the quality of the individual images is reduced when using 3D.2D video:I am impressed by the quality of the video. It takes 720p video at 24 FPS, which is decent for an average HD video camera, but great for a 3D video still camera. There isn't a place for an external mic, however, and while that might be asking for a bit much, it would be a bonus for any amateur stereoscopic cinematographer/photographer.3D photos:This is what had me sold without even checking it out in person. The screen is easy to use and bright in moderate light. When you take it into bright light, it is hard to see, even when you turn up the brightness. At close up shots you can adjust the parallax so that it focuses on the close up image but the picture gets smaller (which is unavoidable) so the best pictures seem to be taken from at least 4 feet (though I did get a good picture of my dad and I when I adjusted the parallax to my hand at arms distance. The curvature of our faces stuck out well.)Overall:I tend not to use the different colors because I haven't had the chance to play with them, but I used the flash/no flash setting for pictures at my brothers wedding reception and it gave me the option to choose the same picture with or without flash. Side note: the pictures come out better sharper when flash is used on some shots for some reason, I don't know why. I haven't experimented much with taking a 3D image with two individual shots, but I can see how that may have its advantages for still shots like artwork or still scenery because of the ability to choose the focal point and distance between images. I tend to use the Anti-blur setting because the image stabilizer is bad to begin with and I get better shots in that setting when not using a tripod. I haven't tried to use it underwater only because i haven't bought a waterproof case that it implicates you can buy. I've gotten good color in the sunset setting and good results in the snow setting this winter. Though like I said, I haven't played much with the different settings so I may not have seen their full potential. And because I am not much of a photographer, I haven't used the manual settings at all due to my lack of experience.You may be able to buy a better version of something on this camera. For example, a flip HD is cheaper and does 60 fps rather than 24, a professional 3D video camera (or whatever you may call them) would provide better resolution and frame rate, and a professional camera with the ability to change lenses would give you more options in terms of versatility, higher quality images, and higher quality 3D images with some adjustments to the images you get from that same camera. But unless you want to carry around two or three different cameras plus lenses, tripod, etc., that alternative wouldn't be very practical. While it is a bit pricey in terms of digital point and shoot cameras, you get a lot for what you pay for, considering how new this technology is.NOTE: Like I said, I am not an experienced photographer so my judgement on the quality of the images may not be as good as it could be. I also haven't had much experience with the camera either. Nothing beats first hand experience, so try to find one to see the 3D capabilities, and don't be discouraged if it is hard to use at first, because it's different from other cameras. Also, 3D hurts some peoples eyes, so if you get headaches at 3D movies or if your eyes aren't corrected properly, it may not be best for you.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Slow, eats battery energy just to breathe.", "Author": "rjh \"rjh\"", "ReviewID": "ROVJXS43WZSTA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We've been into stereophotography for years, mounting twin 35s on angle iron, etc. Thought this would be a godsend.

Geddings", "ReviewID": "R219DK3E68YBBD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the price of 170/160 bucks you can get on amazon for this camera you really cant beat it.  However a few things should be taken into consideration.  Do not rely on this camera as your only camera for 2d pictures and (more so) 2d videos.  The quality of this camera in that area is siginficantly worse to other simulary priced 2d cameras for example the Canon Powershot HS 110 (my fav camera so far.. id HIGHLy recommend it for 2d pics and videos) is significantly better in both photos and video in 2d compared to this camera.  Better color, sharper, much wider angele,  much higher quality (expecially in videos) much better contrast and ability to do much better in lower light.That said.. this is a great camera for 3d.  Mostly for photos though.  I have to say the video quality indoors and in so so indoor lighting is honestly pretty terrible.  It states that it does 720p video. but honestly i woudnt even classify the video as HD its grainy and you can tell in average/low light the detail is terrible worse then many cell phone videos today.  If you have a tripod and take video mostly ourdoors i think the camera would do fine for 3d videos but do not rely on it to take 3d videos of your childs birthday party in a low/average lighting condition indoors.  That honestly tempts me to give this camera only 3 stars.  BUT the 3d in the photos really is so amazing to me that it warrients it being 4 stars also considering the price.  My suggestion to you is if you want a camera that does great 2d pictures and video too. get the Canon Powershot 110 HS, you cant go wrong with both.The other major gripe however for me is the very small lens angle, i guess ive been spoiled by the great wide angle on the Canon powershot 110 HS that really lets you fit near everything you want in the frame (awesome for hd video and widescreen pics).  This camera however you really need to back up quite a bit if your trying to get a large scene.  My guess is as my grandmother said, since you have two lenses instead of one that may be the reason (that and to save money on making the camera by not having to have Two wide angle lenses)but if you can overlook the shortcomings.  You will have a pretty awesome camera for 3d. and the screen on the back of the camera (while a bit low res some pics end up looking a tad grainy/blown out. on the screen when it is not that bad actually.  The 3d on the screen is easy to see. and it seems to have a slightly better viewing angle then the 3ds's 3d screen which is helpful and can produce less eye strain.(honestly for the price if you dont have a 3d tv at all i would say its worth it to get the camera anyways as you can show people the screen on the back in viewing photos and most have no problem seeing it)  whats also nice is that theres a slider to position the convergence of the pictures after you shoot it so you can make the images seem more 3d in the background or \"pop out\"  I find however it helps in many cases to adjust it to seem more depth instead of the popping out type...as the camera tends to do that a bit much.  However if you learn how to properly set up the shot and how far away or close you need to be.  you'll get the hang of it.the nice thing also is that if you do not have a 3d tv. you can use free software (the software on the disk really is a bit hard to use i coudnt figue it out) but search the web.  that can convert the pictures into red + blue anagylph images and then use cheap 3d anayglph glasses you can buy online to view them..even in that mode the 3d depth really is awesome.  and the picture quality (providing your in enough light and you didnt shake the camera too much and all before the shot was taken) is good enough to give a good 3d experence (for some reason the picture quality seems to be a lot better in photos then it is in videos)anyways i think this is a great entry level 3d camera.  If you have a nice big 3d tv however you may wish to spend the money on a higher quality 3d dedicated camcorder for videos however.  But for 3d photos its a great buyits amazing how 3d can really make photos stand out....but a good tip is really focus on perspective.  perspectve oriented shots in 2d give the illusion of depth, but in 3d actually provides it.  to pratice, long hallways and such is a good start!in many cases if you line up the picture and all right you can get an awesome 3d view! but it takes some pratice and there are various modes on the camera that can help too.so that is a good thing to consider. this camera while it is point and shoot, takes a little more thought into taking the picture and sometimes some adjustment for 3d.  as sometimes you make take a few pictures that does not seem that 3d (you may notice that in some of the videos/pictures posted online of this camera) thats just because that shot was not really set up so well to give depth.  But trust me this camera is fully capible of that!in the right situations it can almost really feel like your looking down a hallway or that your pearing into something in the distance.  If your a very creative person i think its great for people like that.  3d depth gives you a whole new level to work with that is just not possible with normal 2d photography.bottom line: you can actually capture depth.I am happy i bought this camera, wanted to a year ago but the price was higher and actually the reason i bought it now was i am getting the Oculus Rift a virtual reality headset that someone made a program for to view 3d pictures and videos with in full color (please note may not be entirely recommended to preoder the Oculus rift right now they are back ordered and its the developer version which hss a low res screen .. a consumer version is planning to come out next year so its more adviced to wait.  But for the price you really cant go wrong with this camera either way.For 3d however if you plan to take  a LOT of 2d pictures (which there is a mode to switch between the two. but you really do not need to....on default settings the camera saves a 2d .jpeg images every time it takes a 3d picture ..which can be turned off if you wish)  but what i mean is.. do not plan to buy it it to replace a 2d camera (unless your 2d camera is just really really really bad) but this is a great camera for 3d photos and some 3d video :-)no regrets!", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dissapointed", "Author": "arizonaames", "ReviewID": "RB7EZRZZY2SCE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Parallax and the video quality is no better than my EVO V phone camera.

I'm an embedded systems engineer. I'm not put off by technology or complex things. I'm put off by this camera.When viewing pictures on the back screen it takes a FULL FIVE SECONDS to display an image. A blurry preview image is displayed instantly, but it takes a FULL FIVE SECONDS for the full resolution image to pop into focus. Whatever embedded operating system Fuji is using to drive this device should be thrown away. Picture display delay is absurd. If the OS isn't the problem here then the CPU must be too slow. If that's the case, then get a GPU, Fuji.While deleting an image the camera displays a stupid animation that takes about two seconds. This animation is stupid for two reasons. First, it slows me down. The camera should take me back to the menu immediately. It doesn't take two seconds to delete an image, and even if it did take that long the camera should delete the image in the background. If the camera OS doesn't support multitasking then it should be thrown away. This is the 21st century. This camera should at least approach the computing power of my 4 year old iPhone, especially considering that it costs almost as much... Second, the animation is stupid because it is not animated in 3D. That may sound like a weird complaint, but it LITERALLY HURTS my eyes to watch the 3D image dissolve into a 2D animation. It confuses my eyes. It's not something my eyes would ever see in reality. It's hard to explain, but it actually hurts to look at the screen while deleting images. Literally, literally.The camera should be three inches wider. The problem is that the right lens is exactly where my middle finger wants to rest while holding the camera. I could get used to holding the camera uncomfortably, but it's just annoying. I'd rather have a bigger, awkwardly shaped camera, rather than be forced to hold it awkwardly.Other than these complaints, the camera is pretty cool. The display is impressive. It's no iPhone Retina display, but I was actually expecting the lenticular 3D display to be much worse than what I saw. The 3D pictures are great. I'm a 3D aficionado. I've been taking 3D pictures with custom built equipment for over 20 years. I would actually prefer a slightly wider interocular distance, since I've found that most people tend to use 3D cameras to photograph distant objects. A slightly wider interocular distance would not hurt portraits too much and would make distant scenery more dramatic. The camera elements are not fixed focus. This is good. A lot of cheap 3D cameras are fixed focus. They have a real mechanical focus and zoom. The focus is a little slow, but not too bad.This is disappointing camera mainly because it comes so close to being great.
