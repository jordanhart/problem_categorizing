{"Reviews": [{"Title": "No Battery Problem Here !", "Author": "Eric Degerstrom", "ReviewID": "R1L9OVIGUHSKNT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased for my 13-year-old god-child, she loves it!!  A great \"point & shoot\" camera for novice photographers; easy to use, small enough for purse or pocket, convenient for school, special events, or those \"oh, I wish I had a picture of that\" moments.  Produces crisp & clear photos that are easily downloaded to the computer.She easily fills a 128meg photocard (200+ photos) on a single set of batteries! Digital cameras take a lot of battery power, especially if you leave the LCD display and the \"auto flash\" on...A \"aaa\" NiMH rechargeable battery kit costs about $15 and batteries last from 4-10 times longer per-charge than conventional batteries and are generally good for about 300 \"recharges\" before replacement.  Instead of $100s per year for batteries as was suggested, $15 every couple of years is more realistic.", "Date": "October 14, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great pics and featurs from an affordable camera", "Author": "Dennis V. Mela \"CyberDude\"", "ReviewID": "R3SZVSM7C7SBH9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my daughter to replace a digital camera that failed after 1 year of use.  The DS6639 is a small but powerful little camera.  The LCD as well as viewfinder allow for review/delete/re-take of pictures that didn't quite make it.  Usually, the problems are with the user and not the camera.  Its compact size makes it easy to carry in her purse or on a lanyard around her neck.  I have noticed a considerable difference in the quality of the pictures that she has uploaded to her computer.  I've not yet printed any photos from this camera but I am very sure that the resolution is more than addequate for 4x6 and even well taken 8x10 blowups.  I will certainly look this and other cameras from this company if I the need arises to purchase another.", "Date": "July 19, 2005"}, {"Title": "great point and shoot camera!!!", "Author": "pgp", "ReviewID": "R2MRX1DIKQMRZ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is pretty good for the price.  I love the slim size! I bought this camera for my vacation this year and it took some pretty good pictures.  Overall I am satisifed with the camera.  As far as the battery life; its okay, but then again all digital cameras require alot of juice.", "Date": "September 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "Best camera Available under $100", "Author": "Big-Z", "ReviewID": "RL9HQ6F0JCDTI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have bought and used numerous digital cameras beginning in 1992. This little beauty with its many settings takes wonderful outdoor pictures in good light and mediocre pictures in low light, as expected. On rechargeable AAA batteries, I have gotten well over 100 pictures. It is small, sylish, light, comes with a nice case and cables. Overall, a nice nice camera for the price.", "Date": "January 14, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great gift for a teenager", "Author": "cavymadness \"VC\"", "ReviewID": "R1KI354O22HUGN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent value for the money - a great little camera if you don't need large prints (8x10 and bigger)!", "Date": "January 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "great little camera", "Author": "Thomas G.
