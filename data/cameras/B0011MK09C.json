Lots of modes, qualities and sensitivity to choose from in the menu.  Stand alone with batteries or use supplied 12v adapter.  I called Support to ask a couple of questions and the guy was unrushed and pleasant. You can paint or camouflage all but the lens, so concealment will be easy. The motion sensor is through the pinhole lens at the bottom. Plays on your TV or load to computer with card reader.  The picture quality is very acceptable and in color. I'm tempted to spring for another one.  Keep an eye on your vehicle or campsite while your off having fun.Rob", "Date": "May 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Does not work well in continuous mode with over write.", "Author": "D.

Burnam", "ReviewID": "R3RZKQHBLJPOK8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At first I debated this product due to mixed reviews, but knew I had to at least try it. The installation is not difficult at all. If you're hands on and like tinkering with things then this is for you. The instruction book will make it seem harder to operate than it really is. One you plug it in and get it going you can easily navigate the menu screen and figure out how to get it working, but it works! As for lighting you will need to place this in a well lit area, so don't put it facing sunlight or bright light or it's pointless. At night time there is nothing but darkness because this is not a night vision ready camera. I love that it comes with an SD storage card that you can also view from your laptop computer and the quality is also clear. I tried it on Media Player on Windows Vistas and it worked, but you don't need a computer to playback. The video will play back on a t.v. if you have the audio video plug-ins, can be hooked up to the ones on a VCR, DVD, or DVR. As for batteries it's still working pretty well with standard energizer batteries that aren't lithium, but there is also an AC adapter included it can run off of. If you want to use that you need to mount the camera (mounting bracket included) close to a wall plug. The mounting bracket is not difficult to install, it has a a small circular mounting plate with three screws, plus and extended arm, which I left off and just used the swivel bracket which will tighten once you know the direction you want the camera pointing. I like the product it is on the pricey side, but well worth catching shady people, especially if you live in an apartment building where too many people from management to maintenance have keys to your place and you can't always know when they come. If the price ever goes down I would be quick to buy another one.", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great quality, great video. great price!", "Author": "B.

It also greatly impressed the deputy who saw it before suggesting the bulb stealer stay out of my yard. I had it plugged in electricity.

E. Williams", "ReviewID": "RXCMVY7K1R8NV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is a learning curve on setting this up, but not all that steep, and quite a bit of it is intuitive.About yhe only quibbles I have is that I can find no reference in the instruction and spec manual to the fact that if the power is cut, the installed batteries do not appear to keep it running. At least, the video output goes away and the SD card didn't show anything when I pulled it.Which does somewhat defeat its purpose.Second qubble is that unless disguised as something else, which, fortunately, isn't all that tricky since it isn't all that big, its appearance is more likely to draw attention than get it ignored by the sort of people one least would want to do this, since they would be more likely simply to take it, along with whatever they came for, than not.Which would also rather defeat its purpose.Leaving those two caveats aside, it is a very neat device, and the one I bought came with a 2 GB SD chip rather than the 1 GB SD I expected.Since I did not know for sure exactly where I would wind up wanting it, and its size makes it quite portable, I mounted it on a wheel from a 5\" caster since it is not designed to stand up by itself, and this made placing it upright on a shelf with the best tilt much simpler. And permits concealment of both the power and video feed cords.Would be better if the video jack were not on the top of the unit, would make disguising its function a bit easier.Or else a right-angle flat black video plug were provided with the PI1000.Or failing this, The video output were resettable so as to let the PI1000 lie on its side while still providing an upright image.It is supposed to be covert, after all, and a bright yellow video connector sticking out of the top doesn't really do much for this.Too eye-catching.Sorry about that.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Spy Camera", "Author": "Da Boz \"BoyBoz\"", "ReviewID": "R2H27WO0GQGVMB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera does a great job accordong to its features.

Wood", "ReviewID": "R1GAIDA74474T3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been playing with this camera for a week now.  It has a lot of good things going for it, which are mentioned in other reviews: very good video quality with sufficient lighting, useful modes of operation and it is easy to review the captured images on any reasonably new television. However- and it's a biggie!-you WILL need to use the power adapter instead of trying to run it using batteries..  I put in 4 new AA batteries at first and tried it out.  I placed the camera in motion mode. The batteries shot about 5 minutes of footage in an 8 hour period before they stopped.  I bought the recommended lithium batteries.  In fact, I bought the ER \"Ultimate\" Lithium batteries.  At $10 for 4 of these, I was certainly hoping for a good result. What I got was less than 15 minutes of footage in a 12 hour period before they stopped. I thought for sure something was defective with my camera, but the next time I connected with the power cord and it filmed just as I had hoped.  Now, the problem is, that the manual would leave you to believe you could get 12 hours of footage using lithium batteries.  Instead, what you get is 12 hours of monitoring by the camera with very little (in my case, less than 15 minutes of footage).  I spoke with customer service at SVAT and was told that this camera is ONLY meant to be used with a power cord and that the batteries were ONLY to be used as backup.  I would have liked to have known that before I made the purchase.  That's why I'm telling you.  It may very well make a difference in whether or not you can use this for home surveillance. I am not sure where I can place the camera that I can hide the cord.  It is supposed to look like a motion sensor in an existing security system.  None of my motion sensors have wires dangling from them.  Worse, the cord is only 5 ft. or 1.5m long, so you will almost certainly need an extension cord to plug that power adapter into a wall outlet.  So now you have a sensor with a cord hanging down, connecting in the middle of the wall to an extension cord which runs to the power outlet. Not exactly discreet!  You may find a place you can use the device, but you should know on the front end that that will depend upon whether or not you have a very nearby power outlet where a \"motion sensor\" would look appropriate.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good so Far", "Author": "nannycam", "ReviewID": "RXFGD5VABNRJP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Equipment seems to work just fine, easy to set up.
