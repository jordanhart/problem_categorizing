I chose it on a whim because while our neighborhood is good and there's very little crime here, a little extra deterrent doesn't hurt. As the company suggests, these would also be well paired with a real security system to make it look like you have more coverage than you actually do.Especially from a distance the cameras very realistic. According to the manual it's the actual body of a functional camera that they just replaced with new innards. It's fairly lightweight plastic instead of metal, so I don't know if the real one is actually metal or plastic like this is. In either case, if you haven't mounted high enough up nobody's going to be able to tell anyway. The face of the camera looks very realistic, just like a real camera would look. You slide off the top cover to expose the battery compartment so it's not readily visible either. Mounting instructions are easy to follow.Two things do bother me about the camera though. The first is very minor, but they have the battery instructions on a sticker stuck to the outside of the camera. They were hard to remove without leaving sticker residue behind and leaving them on what seemed to me a very good signal that it's a fake camera. The second more major thing, the flashing light is a little too frequent. It's beeping every few seconds, which seems to me like it's trying too hard. Seeing that just makes me think \"Look at me.  I'm a fake camera.\"And I would've been much happier if it blinked less frequently.The package is a very good deal of the price, even including several window stickers. I looked up the company on their website and actually make real cameras, so having a sticker with their logo may carry little more weight than some of the other ones you can just find for sale on Amazon that's say \"camera in use\". There were four stickers if I remember correctly, so even if you mess up one you'll still have enough to put on a couple of windows.  Criminals are routinely deterred by even the suggestion they might get caught (wouldn't you be?) so they're a nice touch.  I'm happy with the product, though I may just run the camera without batteries so the blinking isn't so constant.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "The LED Cycle May Ruin The Effect", "Author": "J. Sullivan", "ReviewID": "R20IE9BKO1MOB4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "\"Hello...fake camera here! Look at me...I'm a fake camera!\" At least, that is what it looks like if you install two AA batteries into the unit and see it steadily blink its huge, bright red LED for one and a half seconds on followed by one and a half seconds off cycle.The LED makes it a bit too obvious. It would have been perfect had the LED performed a more subtle, microsecond \"all systems go\" blip every ten seconds or so - something that would only catch someone's eye if they're casing the joint. Instead, it draws attention to itself so obviously, that it draws potential thieves' attention, and they can easily conclude that there are things worth stealing and that you bought a fake camera as a diversion.Without the ridiculous LED cycle, it is an excellent deterrent. The camera looks realistic and intimidating. I recommend melting a bulge at the end of the dummy-wire's tube, or use an alternate method, to keep it inside the base just in case the wind happens to pull it out of the hole over time.I'm not sure if Defender's real security system cameras blink the same way or not, but if they do, only then would I use the blink in conjunction with the real cameras to blend in. Otherwise, I feel more comfortable leaving it as a non-flashing dummy.

The goal here is to have a realistic-looking security camera set up to make people think that you have an area under surveilance.  It's the equivalent of posting a security alarm sign in your yard when you really don't have one.  If you're just looking for a first-glance deterrent, this would probably work.  But if someone gets close enough to look carefully, they'll figure out that it's just for show.For $15, it's not an awful choice.  Home camera systems are more common these days, and someone looking for a easy mark would likely move on if they noticed this.  I'd prefer the LED activity light be a little less blatant, but it would catch the eye of someone in the area and make them think twice.

There are no street lights on our street and deterrence is pretty much left up to the homeowner.  During the day our \"Beware of Dog\" signs put anyone who pulls into our front drive on notice.  Criminals usually look for easy targets and the signs or the sight of any of our dogs on our property do a good job--during the daytime.  Darkness brings another challenge, hence the camera mounted on a lamp post inside the gated area.

It comes with stickers with the Defender brand which is a true, DIY-based security system company.  They sell covert products and real security products and cameras as well.  You can use this camera to expand the effectiveness of a real DVR-based security system or just on it's own.  It is created with a weatherproof casting and is supposed to be used in a conspicuous place to deter thieves.  It comes with 3 mounting screws, a blinking red LED light that operates on 2 AA batteries (not included).  Access to the batteries is through a slide-off panel at the top of the unit.  I am unsure how long the batteries last in the unit as the light has no on-off switch.This is a great, cheap deterrent to add to an already existing security system (or on it's own, although I wouldn't recommend a single camera).  If used creatively and in conjunction with signs and stickers, you will probably lessen your chances of getting your house broken into.  Even an authentic invisible security system with signs and stickers can be made just a little bit more conspicuous with this camera decoy.  A way to make a burglar think twice.I live in the Northeast with snow, ice, frigid temperatures and water ... I will be interested to see how the plastic holds up to extremes.

While we waited for the HOA to make a decision on new security measures, I ordered these \"cameras.\" They seemed like a good temporary measure. My wife and I were impressed as soon as we opened the box. Defender makes security cameras and the PH300 looks authentic because it uses the same housing as Defender's working cameras. It installed easily (just screw it in and arrange the \"power cord\"). We've had guests over, including an electrical engineer who builds security systems, but none of them has realized it was fake. Also, our HOA is now looking into installing cameras because our neighbors noticed the \"upgrades.\" So, these cameras will fool people.However, don't get a false sense of security. Imitation cameras work best as part of a security system. We also installed new locks and an audible alarm, for example. The imitation cameras are most useful when supported by other visible measures that will lend credibility to their deterrent effect and give you another line of defense in case an intruder isn't deterred.

A few people have said that the LED is too \"look at me! I'm a fake camera!\", like the fake camera is trying too hard to look like a real camera.  Real cameras have an LED light that blinks too, usually so you know it's powered and on.  Also, when the camera is real, you want a potential crook to notice it and hopefully make them think twice and move along to easier pickings, in order to prevent the crime in the first place.*However*, the LEDs on real cameras usually only quickly flash once every minute or so, like you'd see on smoke detectors.  The LED on this Defender imitation camera blinks on for a second, off for a second, on for a second, off for a second, etc.  It is the weak point of this imitation camera.  Even my elderly mother-in-law stopped when she saw the camera blinking and asked what was up with the flashing light on it, and when she found out it wasn't a real camera, she agreed that the light on it wasn't \"right\", and said that when she's out shopping the store's security cameras don't have blinking lights on them like that.  So if she can spot something amiss on an imitation camera, that's not good.I hope that in the future Defender will change the way the LED blinks to something more subtle and real.

I appreciate the fact that they are looking out for me and any other person who want to protect their property.Security, whether it be real or fake, is a good thing in my book, but the Defender PH300 Imitation Security Camera pushes the limits a bit too far in my opinion.  The camera itself looks very good.  It's basically a gutted housing for a legitimate security camera.  It comes with mounting screws and anchors for sheetrock and four stickers that let any would-be intruders know that Defender has your back.  It also has a \"wire\" that fits into a slot on the mounting bracket that gives the appearance of going into the wall and eventually meeting up with the rests of your security system.Placed in any somewhat obvious area of your home or property, this camera proves to be an excellent crime deterrent that would at least make most criminals think twice about knocking your door down.  However, this faker comes with one too many tricks up its sleeve.  That one fault is the fact that the friggin' LED light is too bright and too obvious.  It almost screams out, \"Hey, look over here!  Ooooh, I'm a tough security camera and I'm watching you!\" while it brightly flashes away.  It's sort of like the school bully who tries to bluff you into believing that they can hurt you by trying to act really, really tough when, in actuality, they are all bark and no bite.With the LED turned off (it comes on when you install two AA batteries which aren't included), this camera is a bit more subtle and a bit more convincing as a legitimate security camera in my opinion.  Without the light, a criminal might get a glance of it and think, \"Hey, they are trying to be sly with this dark devil.  I better stay away.\"  On the other hand, if the criminal sees the flashing LED, they might think, \"Cool, a fake camera!  I'm taking that with me!\"In short, while I like the concept of the fake camera, I don't like the obviousness of the LED light.

Cost me two bucks plus drilling a hole, and it worked great, as I never had a break-in again. All of which is to say that thieves will in general go for the easiest mark---show them that you know they're around and you might thwart them easily.This fake security camera works on that principle. The four stickers that come with it might be an even better deterrent, as Defender does make real cameras etc too. The camera is plastic and to be useful should be mounted high enough that it can't be examined too closely. But it looks real enough from a distance, and my main quibble is that the flashing red LED, which goes on for a half second every two seconds, is too big. It kind of looks like it's pretending to be what it isn't, which it is, which is not what one would prefer.That sentence confuses me even though I wrote it, and one hopes this camera will confuse or scare crooks enough to make them look elsewhere.
