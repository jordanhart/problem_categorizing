{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Faux Security camera", "Author": "BartMan \"BartMan\"", "ReviewID": "RXJAOL83QFHX1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera looks like the real thing.  We have something very much like it at my workplace.  It's an easy 10 minute install, and until you get up close, say about 10 feet away or so, it's difficult to tell the difference from the genuine article.  To make it even more real appearing, I drilled a small 1/8\" hole on the under side of the camera and placed one end of a length of white vinyl clothes line in it and sealed it with clear silicone caulking, then, strung the other end to the base mounting bracket and also sealed it, with a about 6\" slack for movement.  It was a finishing touch that really sets it off for that \"Let's not do it, there's a live security camera.\" affect.  Remember, get at least two cameras if you live in a rather high crime area, and always keep fresh batteries in service.  The bad guys and gals know that security cameras always \"blink\" if they work.This camera takes 3 AAA batteries, which lasts only 4 to 6 weeks or so.  I use 1.2 volt 1000 mAh capacity rechargeable lithium batteries. They'll last longer than fresh alkaline batteries.  However, use good quality Lithium batteries for the longest service.  That's the bad thing about any faux camera.  These cameras use 3 AAA batteries, but if they used 2 or 3 C or D batteries, they would last for maybe 3 months.  This is the only flaw to these fake security cameras.  I tried to find other cameras that used C or D batteries, but I believe they don't exist.  The good things are, they're easy to install, look real and have easy battery replacement if you place them where you don't have to use a tall ladder, which might be unsafe. The purpose of any security device is to prevent anything from happening in the first place, and to allow the bad people to decide whether they want to risk being seen by any cameras, fake or real.  These will do the trick, and they're reasonably priced with free shipping on this particular item.  This \"security\" is cheap enough for the price.  There's no way of knowing just how many vandals it will discourage.  If it doesn't work, there's always the .44 Magnum, the Double Barrel 12 gauge or \"Dragon\", the Rottweiler watch dog.I'd give this item 5 stars if the battery capacity was higher.  It is a solid 4 stars, however.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Dummy Dome Security", "Author": "Johnnyd", "ReviewID": "R1XN0MM0GRLYPU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Dummy Home Security fake camera is ok, not quite what I expected with the blinking red light.
