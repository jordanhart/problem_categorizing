I have three of these cameras and have found them to be very reliable and they were very easy to set up.  As far as security settings, I prefer MAC address filtering, so I had no problem in communicating with them once the modem was configured.  I use motion triggering to upload pictures to a remote FTP server.  Using the cameras I learned that my maid service was only working about 1/3 of the time they claimed.  Previously I tried two other sets of cameras and these are by far the most reliable and useful.  One star off because they are quite expensive.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Did not live up to expectations", "Author": "nuke", "ReviewID": "R3IJJJ5NH8T0T1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Possibly I was expecting too much, but for the price this should have been a high quality unit.  Ended up returning it.  The disappointments were:Poor low-light performance. Rated at .01 lux. It switched to B&W; mode, but still the night vision was not as expected.Probably as a result of communication/processing lag, but the tilt/pan/zoom actions were not smooth, but jerky.The biggest disappointment of all was two hot pixels when viewing at night.  At first I thought \"what are those bright spots I cannot see with the naked eye\" but soon noticed they remained in the same spot when panning.  For the price, there should have been better QC on the sensor.The good points were, easy to configure, plenty of options, the motion detect is a great feature (but wish it would follow the target), embedded web interface, and quality construction.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Zoom is best feature for the price", "Author": "Vernon Hershberger", "ReviewID": "R24T7COME1KO4R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The optical Zoom is the best feature for the price.
