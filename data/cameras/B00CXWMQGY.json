I had a stroke and the other cameras were too heavy to hold for longer than one or two photos. I simply love this camera. It is exactly what I was looking for. The photos are clear and sharp and the lower weight was a fit for me. In fact, I liked it so much that I bought this one for my daughter for Christmas. She called me after she received it and said she loved the camera. She especially liked the touch screen and the photos did not need Photoshop work afterwards.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome DSLR!", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "R1FY9FQNHNZRDM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this Canon SL1 for about a month now, and I love it!
