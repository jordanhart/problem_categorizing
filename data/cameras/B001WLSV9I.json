{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Better than nothing....", "Author": "J. Graganta \"JG\"", "ReviewID": "R37HH8SUI6Q5X2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The purchase of this product was a knee jerk reaction/purchase to being broken into last fall.  The choice of having nothing vs having to subscribe to an alarm service was not pleasing.  A relative has a similar DIY alarm system and said they were happy with it and this provided a middle ground.As stated, the instructions are a little hard to digest at first, but once you understand it, it's fairly easy to program the unit and sensors. (The picture shows the alarm having an extendable antenna as well as the sensors, but the unit received did not have any.)The supplied no name batteries didn't last very long.  The one motion sensor that is in a high traffic area died with in 3 months and the replacement battery is not doing so well (brand name).  So don't be surprised if you have to replace the 9V battery twice or three times a year in high traffic areas.  The remote control battery is an odd ball size that I only found at Radio Shack (didn't look online, it was actually stocked). I purchased extra motion sensors and the door sensors I have not mounted yet.  Keep extra batteries for the sensors around and check the sensors that they are working.The unit is suppose to have a battery backup, but I have yet to see how that works.  If you have to manually switch it over, then it's pointless (only skimmed the manual).  I unplugged the unit expecting it to keep \"alive\" and it went off.  If I want it to last/work during a power outage, I might as well get an uninterrupted power supply they use for computers.  Also, when the unit is plugged into the phone line and you are using it, it makes a beeping or chirping noise that is heard.  If the phone is plugged into the unit, it actually hangs up on you!  Factory says this isn't right, but I don't want to sent it back and NOT have protection.I purchased two units, giving one to a friend who has experienced multiple break-ins. Since then, he has been broken into once since it was installed.  The unit did call him and his kids and he called me to check his home (less then 5 min way).  He also did not use the door sensor, only relying on the supplied motion alarm.  The alarm will scare people off, but be warned, there is still time between activating and actually getting someone there- at least 5-7 min or more.  If you want a faster response time, then pay for a monitored alarm service.  (Or purchase the external siren to alert neighbors quicker.)  Once I walked into my house forgetting to disarm the unit with the remote control, it went off using the motion sensor and called me with in 5-7 seconds of going off.  I test my sensors at least every 3-4 months to make sure they set the unit off and to make sure it calls me.I have experienced one false alarm.  The unit went off and called.  Upon inspection of home, the unit reset it's self (I didn't memorize all the codes for remote operation)- all doors and windows were secure.  Unit was still armed when entering (used remote to disarm).  It is unclear if it was a malfunction, or if the motion sensors detected a movement.  We have never had any issues with drapes and heat vents in the past, but we suspected it.  Unless someone was trying to jimmy a sliding glass door and brushed up against the blinds creating movement(?)- but I have not tested that idea.It was recommend by local law enforcement that an external audible siren be also used. The internal alarm and unit going off is enough for 'noise' inside the home, but for an alarm to work effectively, an external siren is suggested to alert neighbors of any problems.  (I maybe ordering more internal plug in sirens or one or two external battery powered sirens.)Would I recommend this alarm?  Yes and no.  Does it work... yes, but not perfectly.  Are there better out there, I'm sure there are.  Do your research, see what is available.  I have it already, so I'm making do.(Alarms are just one tool to help secure a location.  It is not a substitute for not having good door locks/dead bolts.  Next step in home defense is to install cameras to record the exterior and any visitors.  That way, intruders 'risk' being identified if they try.... Multiple layers of protection will HOPEFULLY deter intruders from choosing your home.  And yes, dogs are part of that layer also!)PS-IMPORTANT NOTE---- IMPORTANT NOTEIMPORTANT: When using an alarm system that does NOT call a security monitoring service, DO NOT tell people that.  It's better to make people think it is a MONITORED service.  If you tell \"friends\" and the word gets around, the wrong people could find out.  And then the wrong people know that they have \"time\" before someone actually shows up.  Right?", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "OK", "Author": "K.

The motion detector, it is not the most reliable, but it also works, I believe the reliability has to do with the fact that it seems to read the environment every 5 seconds or so.I live in a small apartment, and I don't know what is the actual range of these devices and cannot say if they work well in large houses/apartments.So far, it is working OK.", "Date": "January 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Get Less Than What You Pay For", "Author": "J.

Has got to be the worst piece of crap I've ever owned.Agreed with most other reviewers - the instructions (esp. syntax of commands not to mention the English grammar) are HORRIBLE!  But the main problem overall is that it is simply God-awful UNRELIABLE! I've had it for about 6 months and have experienced at least 3 false alarms.  Not armed, sitting there in my family room just watching TV and all of a sudden one of the sirens starts blaring for no reason.  Another time my wife and I were awoken in the middle of the night with the thing ringing.  We did NOT arm it at night.  Not only that, but it won't always shut OFF reliably!  3AM and my wife and I are frantically pushing the disarm button on the remote, siren still blaring away.  Sometimes the remote works, sometimes not (yes, it and everything has fresh batteries - oh, but they discharge within a few months, even name-brand).  Then, the range is terrible.  We don't have a big house, single story, but some of the further away door sensors don't trigger the alarm.  I also (regretfully) bought the outdoor siren.  Works maybe half the time, and it's only about 30 feet away from console.  Then there are the motion sensors, which only sense a motion every 5 seconds.  I can walk past the range of one easily within 5 seconds and the light never flashes.  Sometimes to get it to flash I have to stand in front of it and wave my hands wildly.  (I suppose if a burglar did that it might ring...)  I'd give this piece of junk 0 stars if I could.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "JUNK!", "Author": "JK7777", "ReviewID": "R3TWYOP08OK7SG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't write many reviews but this alarm system is such junk that I felt compelled to warn everyone way from it because, at least for me, it took a bit before it started acting up. And it's only after I've had mine for little over a month now that it has reached the point where I just hate the thing. The funny thing is that at first I was somewhat satisfied with it due to the ease of installation. I bought the system and additional motion sensors and door/window sensors to cover the entire house from a popular electronics warehouse. The sales guy at the store told me to buy fresh batteries because the ones supplied were most likely dead and shouldn't be used. So when all tallied up was a pretty hefty price tag. But installing was a breeze and even though the instructions were difficult to understand I managed to get it installed in only a few hours. Unfortunately the thing is totally unreliable because of numerous false alarms. At first only one false alarm per week but now three or four times a week and it's only a month or so old. At least their support is reachable and I've tried their suggestions to no avail. I guess the next step is to swap it out. Still, I wish I had read the negative reviews here before purchasing this home alarm system. To me, the system definitely isn't worth the pain of the constant false alarms. My take on it is to pass this one by and try another system.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fills a need", "Author": "Bad_Shot", "ReviewID": "R1O0GL4CPI48GI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this unit for one feature, that was being able to disarm the unit via a phone.I purchased this unit, plus an additional PIR and external alarm.I concur with others the instructions leave a lot to be desired.First Replace all the batteries.

When first setting up understand that there is a delay in arming the system. Didn't understand that when we first tried testing the sensors and the alarm wasn't going off correctly. Once we knew that everything worked fine and we are ready to order more sensors. The system also has a \"home\" and \"away\" setting which is great if you need only certain sensors to be active (home) or all of them active (away). We have a back area of our home that we like to be armed while we are home, especially during the summer, perfect for the \"home\" option. The wireless remotes work great and have a large range to them. Added our cell numbers which it can handle up to 5 of them, it calls them in the order you put them into the system.

I am reasonably intelligent and mechanically astute but some of the instructions were impenetrable. Activating and deactivating remotely by phone has a serious shortcoming. Dunno about you but I want to leave my answering machine on while I am traveling; the remote activate/deactivate cannot be done unless you leave your answering machine turned off.

Motion sensor seems sensitive enough, and the wireless plug in alarm works great over 50 ft away in my house [the unit is used to protect my garage]. The thing shrieks like a banshee, I hope it doesn't give me a heart attack. The alarm on the module itself it not nearly as loud, but loud enough to let a thief know that hes been detected. I was worried that the first thing a thief would do it rip it off the wall to stop the alarm, attracted by the glowing red light.So I screwed in a half inch board in front of it. I won't need to access the panel much, since the remotes take care of arm/disarm. If I need to, it will be simple enough to unscrew it in 3 seconds, something the average burglar is not going to take the time to do.The remotes are very nice, all metal construction, and have a decent range. I can disarm it well before I even reach the door, and the unit chirps to let you know its disarmed.It apparently stays disarmed until you rearm it, would be nice to have a feature that it auto rearms after, say, an hour or two. But most alarms I suppose you must arm, and it will be easy enough to do once you fall into the habit of doing it.I feel more secure already, I don't live in a high crime area, but you never know. I got loads of tools that would be a crackheads dream to sell, and locks can be defeated with ease. Most burglars would immediately haul ass away when an alarm goes off, if they don't they just might when I come out with my German Shepards and Glock.Between my locks, motion sensor lights and alarm, I feel I am reasonably protected for a good price.Only down sides so far, and it might be my fault as I haven't messed with it much, is the door/window alarm doesn't seem to work. It is a simple affair, a sensor with a magnetic strip on the other side of the door/window. When it is open, the magnetic field is broken, and that activates the alarm.I first put the supplied battery in, a red light went on, then stayed off, I figured the battery was fried, so I got a new one. No red light, no nothing, I don't know if the sensor is toast or what.Haven't got my phone call feature to work yet either.

If I set it to \"First Defense Line\" (6 though 10) or \"Second Defense Line\" (11-15), the alarm will NEVER go off...it only chips if the unit is armed and the door is being opened/closed.  Hmmm...can't find any info on this :(", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "My home would be emptied if I relied on this seurity system", "Author": "Annie Oakley", "ReviewID": "R1I7KNR4S8UA09", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The door sensors don't respond with a full out alarm until the door had been opened 3-4 times. The motion sensor did not sense any motion until I was within 8 feet and standing directly in front of it and then only \"twirped\". The alarm did not go on until I stood 3 feet in front of it and waved my arms frantically. When the alarm does call your phone number to report a break-in, it does not let you listen to what is going on in your home like it is supposed to. The door sensors were very difficult to program. The instructions do not tell you that you have to remove the batteries out of each door sensor as you program another door sensor. The remote controllers quit for some unknown reason and each one had to be reprogrammed before they would start working again. I wasted 2 days trying to figure out what I was doing wrong and spent an hour on the phone with tech support. This system will be returned to the company I purchased it from.The bottom line is,  by the time this security system would have alerted me to an intruder, I would be dead and all off my belongings stolen.Nothing like a good pit bull for security.", "Date": "January 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "For in the home only", "Author": "Michael A.

The reason for my low rating was because they advertise a 450 ft range for the sensors, but at about 60 ft it would not work.
