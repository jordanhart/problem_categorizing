{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty slick little device", "Author": "Jerry Nixon \"Regular Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R2AST8EUJES02V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In brief, this camera is very cool - but not perfect.Let us start with the downsides.The first is Kodak itself. They have selected Quicktime MPEG-4 as the format for their videos. As a result, incorporating video with typical video editing software will require a conversion that can cause the quality to degrade.Kodak has also made a small mess by choosing only a proprietary port on the bottom of the camera to connect it to a computer (without a base) and that little adapter is small enough you'll surely lose it within a year.By the way, if you like Kodak's Frame Dock II you are out of luck - although it claims to support the V1253, there is no adapter available for it. I called Tech Support; I was embarrassed for them.I am also a firm believer that the timer feature should be controlled by a physical button and on this camera, it is not.Now, capturing HD quality is amazing, but be ready to train your mind to frame photos differently because you cannot print in 16:9 format.12 megapixel is a little misleading, too. You will probably default to 9 megapixel because it is the only size that will support HD and the 16:9 format. Otherwise you get vertical letterboxing - wasting real estate on the beautiful LCD.This camera is not a point-and-shoot. Although really it is, until you get the settings just right and understand how to use the flash, ISO and stabilization, your first few photos will likely be blurry.If you are like me, you like to access your camera through Windows. When this camera is connected, only the Kodak Easyshare software can see it. That's a drag if you like Picasa. You could always read from your memory card directly but if you get the Extreme III card like me - because it is the fastest and largest on the market - most card readers can't see that either. So much for backwards compatibility.The icons and such on the screen are fine, but for some reason they are fuzzy. Although the psychological effect makes you think your photos are even more clear, anything unclear on an HD camera seems lame.Now, let's move to the positives (less negatives).Any new camera without face detection is not a real camera, I think. This camera has it and does it as fine as any Canon camera I have ever uses. It can even detect two faces at once. It's great.The video quality is the best video quality I have seen on a camera or even on a video camera. It's stunning, stereo, and in amazing HD. It's not like Monday Night Football good, but it's better than anything you have ever created before (for the price, I should add).You know that delay digital cameras have when they start up and before you can take the first picture? Sometimes you even miss the shot (especially with kids). This camera has two seconds to first shot. In my opinion this is a far improvement from earlier Kodak cameras, but there's no question the Canon Sureshot's one second time is better.Kodak reproduces the best color of any camera I have EVER used. I am dedicated to Kodak regardless of their lame software and the imperfect user interfaces as a result. The final product (the photo) is all that ultimately matters, and Kodak simply delivers. Canon is a far cry from the best. Sony's good, though Olympus is better. Kodak still rules.If you are familiar with how to focus a digital camera by holding the shutter button half way down - then you will be able to overcome any delay that is classic with digital cameras. This camera has some delay but it also turns the screen to gray once it takes the photo which is a real disorienting feedback.Switching between photos and video in review mode is amazingly slow. Although it is fast compared to how fast my mobile phone can do it, it's still a little slow. To be fair the resulting images are nearly 2MB and the video is terrifyingly large. So, I can give some mercy on this point.It is not my preference to have the zoom as a shuttle control surrounding the shutter button. I prefer it in the top right of the back. It is also not my preference not to have a physical view finder. However, each camera is different and in the end it is just a preference I have.Finally, it seems to me that the battery might not be as long lasting as I have seen the Canon Sureshots last. They really are a fine camera. Even so, it seems to last an all day excursion. Of course, without a base charging it requires a computer.To be fair, Kodak has an HD base just for this camera. However, it is intended to expose this and other media to an HD television. A base that is not connected to a computer? Couldn't they have added WIFI or something? Dumb.ConclusionI bought this camera because I like cool things. This thing is cool. The video is amazing. The photos are great. The size is nice and small. I bought the IPod white one (which you have to get directly from Kodak) and I love the look of it.However, I don't like Kodak's software and hate that it appears I am stuck with Easyshare. Even so, this appears to be the next big thing in photography - stunning quality, small devices, and cheap prices.Right now, there's nothing else like it out there.In this round of wanting a new camera for myself, this is my third purchase. I have sent the first two back. This one is a keeper. The quality, the color of the images, the small size, the big screen, the video, the cool factor (and color). And it's only $300 (Sept 07).PS: I know the specs say this camera comes with a camera case. But just think \"soft camera sack\" and you won't be disappointed.[UPDATE - late September]My original observation about the battery life was correct. You might as well make plans to buy an additional battery (which is incredibly small for the size of the screen) and also buy a battery charger so when you are on vacation you can charge the camera up without toting your laptop all around.Another down-side to this camera is that when the battery dies, the camera just freezes. It looks like it's a glitch to me. No warning, just black screen and no response - it doesn't even bring in the lens.Yet another downside is that the above freeze issue seems to be recreatable. If you take many photos in quick succession, it seems to freeze pretty reliably. I am hoping for a firmware update to correct this craziness.I would still buy this camera. However my previous comments on video quality might be adjusted since my recent experience. The quality is very good and the size is quite nice, but it does not seem to handle high action very well. There's likely no fix to that - it's likely a flaw in the quality of the MPEG encoder.Even still, the quality of the stills is even more stunning that I initially thought. They are tremendous (even at 9MP) and the HD format really is cool.", "Date": "September 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "M. Johnson", "ReviewID": "R2RRSF7ROU05SJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was leery to purchase this camera one month ago after some negative reviews that cited issues such as slow picture time, blurry, no A/C adapter and that it does not come with a memory card but instead with internal memory storage (with option for SD memory card).  However, I figured the best review I could get was to open the box and use it for a month myself.  The time to take a picture is not slow.  I have a new baby and I push the button down half way to focus wait for the perfect moment and I get the perfect timing every time as opposed to prior cameras.  So I am happy with that.  Only one out of fifty pictures are blurry and that may be because of a poor focus or other issues. I am happy with that.  It doesn't have an A/C adapter but that cuts the price of the camera for those who don't need it.  If you want one pull out ten dollars and get one.  It does not have a memory card include however that too reduces the cost up front for those who don't need one.  Most people are upgrading cameras now days and already have a memory card from a prior camera.  I love the operation system.  It is very easy to navigate and to download onto your computer.  I also like the software that it comes with.  It is all very simple and user friendly.  The weight and design are nice.  It has a large picture viewer.  I have used it for every day around the home and traveling for a day use and have not yet noticed any battery drain.  (I suppose that could change with more frequent use)My pictures are taken in wide format with 9 mega pixels and that is the format and detail that I have become to use.  However I do change to standard 12MP at times and I took some close up pictures of my wife's flowers at that level and the picture quality was perfect.The negatives are that after taking the picture, my camera takes about 1 to 5 sec with gray screen to record the shot.  I have found that to be okay though because we already got the shot we wanted by holding the focus and taking the picture at the right moment.  After the gray screen the picture shows up for view for 3 sec but can be easily by-passed by clicking the action button half way.Good camera...

I have read a lot of negative reviews about this camera and I am really shocked at how people are reviewing it. I'm no photography expert, but i have used digital cameras throughout the years and have come to the conclusion that this one has exceeded every camera i have used. I hope those giving negative reviews have FIRST upgraded the camera's firmware from kodak's website, because all SLOW writing issues and time between shots have been addressed. I use a 4gb class 6 SDHC card and have no issues between shots. It even saves the HD movies at incredible speeds, i'm talking 200+megs in under 4 seconds, thats unheard of. As far as focusing and sharpness is concerned, people have complained about blurry images. Could it be something as simple as holding down the shutter before taking the picture first so it focuses and locks on? When you master this you can take crystal clear pictures very quickly. Minor complaints usb charging, but you can pick up the AC adaptor for 10$.

(Sep/NOV 07'contact Kodak) once this is done with the correcting software, it is one of the best digital cameras on the market. It features Smart scene mode which actually automatically selects the best scene mode for you, if you don't have the time to choose it. Actual video specs listed by Kodak are higher then what is stated.(listed 1024x720)the actual is 1280x720 Full Frame Progressive at 30 frames per second. So the video on here with a large SD card is close to and in some cases even better then many entry level HD Camcorders! Sound on the video is in stereo which is also new to Kodak. To playback HD video beyond the camera's high res 3\" screen, you will need to purchase the Kodak HD dock. ($99) (This hooks directly to your HD TV and is essential to get for viewing both Still images as well as the 720p video) Note Sony's 1080i video on their digicams, does not come close to the Genuine-Progressive full frame video @ 720 on this new Kodak camera. Has an 3200 ISO. About 1600 without to much quality loss.

Seems backwards but indulge me and I'll explain. First of all, I rely on the Amazon reviews when choosing a product. So far I have not been disappointed, for the most part people are responsible with their comments. I initially went to buy a different camera. However, after reading the reviews on it, the only negative review on that camera was the camera jammed.  When I went into the store to ask if this was an issue, the demonstration model was jammed.  Since, I had a coupon that expired that day I picked the brain of the sales people and found that the Easy Share V1253 exceeded the minimum number of options that I wanted and was well within my price range.Well, I just can't be more pleased with my selection.  Kodak loses a star for not including a useful manual or an adapter that can be purchased for $10. My concern was that I'd never figure out how to operate this camera.  It wasn't the challenge I thought it would be.  Also, when I picked up my 16 year old grandson, he had expanded my knowledge base in a few minutes.Love the large screen!!!!Also, I was given a firmware chip upon purchase.  That upgrade resolves the speed issues and then some.  You can view what version of the firmware that is in the camera and compare it to the latest version on the website for a free download.Battery----anything you buy can have a defective battery.  If it takes three hours to charge a battery and the battery doesn't seem to hold a charge, that should be a big clue.Memory ---the earlier cameras came with a memory card because the camera didn't have internal memory.  This camera holds about 10 pictures in the internal memory.  The nice feature is unlike some of the other brands that require a special memory card that you can't find just anywhere, it uses the SD Card which is more popular and always on sale somewhere.Settings----I wouldn't want a camera to hold a setting for snow, moving subjects, panoramic etc. After I turned the camera off, I might forget that setting is on and take inside pictures with a snow setting.The pictures are crisp and clear, download is fast and it has many options for the price that I'm looking forward to learning how to use.I bought a small inexpensive case and it fits nicely in my purse so I'll be prepared to take pictures of my new twin grandsons.I would highly recommend this camera--main reasons the large screen on a compact camera--it takes beautiful pictures--and you get more bang for the buck.", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great potential so far unfulfilled", "Author": "Matthew A.

I'll start with the first issues I've encountered that bother me the most and then detail additional pro's and con's at the end.Please note that I have installed the firmware update as of the first week of December 2007.1.  I've looked all over for a solution, but there is a missing codec for Quicktime, which is largely Apple's fault, but it prevents you from viewing and hearing the video's recorded in HD 720 at this time.  I've read this is an issue in both Vista and XP, although I only have Vista at this time.  I've tried all of the proposed solutions, and I am not the slightest bit challenged in this department.  This is also a pain when you want to take the video you've captured and convert it to a DVD or other media.2.  No matter what size of memory card you have in the camera, it maxes out at 16 minutes of constant video capture.  If you have the memory for more video, you can take more than 16 minutes in total, but they will be in 16 minute (or less) chunks.3.  The focus can be a little glitchy.  I find myself being more patient to wait for it to come into focus, but my wife and mother-in-law have taken many poorer photos with the camera with the point-and-click mentality.  I got the camera in anticipation of the birth of our first child, and I've been disappointed by many of the pictures that my mother-in-law was able to get of the delivery.  As an addition of this, sometimes the foreground is focused correctly but the backgrounds come out very pixelated and blurry, without zoom.The Good:- Re-chargeable battery, just plug into your USB or buy the AC Adapter and you aren't loading up on rechargeable AA batteries anymore, or carrying around the lot in your camera case.- Great HD quality video that will be functional on computers in the future.- Price.  $230 is the going rate and very competitive.The Bad:- Takes poor pictures in poor light- 3x Optical Zoom- 16 minute limit for consecutive video", "Date": "December 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Simply the most amazing in its price range", "Author": "M.

I have a 2GB and 4GB card, and with each, it limits you to 16 minutes; must be a file size restriction or something...very annoying.- On some of the videos that I've captured (while using zoom) the video capture slows down and people look like they're in slow motion. :(- NO DOCK!  This wouldn't be so bad except it's really hard to find a dock to buy for it.  I bought one but it doesn't fit firmly on the dock.  :(- I don't know why they went with Quicktime format...my first impression was that the video from my old Casio Exilim was less pixelated.  It may be a higher resolution but some of that effect is taken away by the fact that the compression isn't as good as some other cameras.- The camera interface isn't as intuitive as I hoped it would be.-OverallThis is a very good camera at a great price.

Allow me to introduce you to the Kodak Easyshare V1253, a 12-megapixel camera that I had the opportunity to use over the holidays. What sets this camera apart isn't its large image capacity - after all, exactly how far will the megapixel craze take us? Will we have 30 megapixel cameras by next Christmas?What really impressed me was the identity crisis this camera has - it thinks it's a camcorder too! I read on the box that this camera was also capable of capturing 30 frames-per-second widescreen video in High Definition (720p). I must admit that I was skeptical since every video I had ever seen captured on a digital camera was horribly inadequate for viewing on a television screen.The video quality blew me away. I shot countless videos over Christmas and proceeded to integrate them into a DVD using iDVD. The end result was a video that impressed everyone who saw it. You could have fooled anyone into thinking it was shot on a HD video camcorder costing 3 times as much.Which brings me to the final selling point for this camera - the price. I would have thought $220 for a 12MP camera was a good deal by itself but the ability to shoot great digital photos and high-definition video? Now that's pretty amazing.There's plenty of other features this camera has such as great face recognition technology, impressive low-light capability but for me the video sealed the deal.

I bought the V1253 on a business trip when I urgently needed a camera.  Sadly, I have been disappointed by it.  I am a very savvy digital camera user.  Here are the problems:1.  The camera is very susceptible to camera shake, and the shutter takes a few seconds to fire off.  So you don't get the action photo you wanted first of all, and then the photos turn out very fuzzy if you have a third party take a photo and they don't know enough to hold the camera VERY VERY STILL as you wait the few seconds for the shutter to go off. This is therefore a bad camera for a teenager.  And a very ineffective camera for a casual point and shoot type of user.2.  The quality of the photos are very good if you are lucky enough to not have camera shake when you took it.  The digital video is high quality too.  The longest video I took was about 12 minutes.  I put in a 2 GB Sandisk and had no issues with memory storage to the disk.3.  Others have noted that it was a funky cord with a cheesy looking adapter to charge the camera attached to your PC. There is no AC charger so I had to buy one for about $10.  It was worth getting.  I would suggest to Kodak they include the AC charger in the first place and charge a bit more for the package.4.  At Christmas, the camera refused to charge.  I did a bunch of troubleshooting with the manual and had to mail it in for repair back East.  I sent it Dec. 10th and did not get it back until January 12.  Thus, it missed the entire Xmas season.

Initial reaction: it's smaller than I thought it'd be. Feels solid and compact, and looks classy. Comes only with a \"getting started guide\" in terms of instructions or documentation. A bit disappointed at that. True, there's a CD in the package, but I had taken the camera to the office, and my company has limits on what I can load on my work computer.The said guide is pretty skimpy, only 21 pages if you don't include the legalese and warranty information. I looked for the AC adapter to charge the battery. There isn't one. You can only charge the battery via a USB adapter. And since I could not load the software CD, I could not read any instructions beyond the guide. I connected the camera to my PC, and a blue flashing light came on. All seems OK. After 90 minutes or so, the original blue light became solid, and a second one (with a movie camera icon) started to blink. I figure that meant the charging was done, but let's face, it's only my assumption.I disconnected the cable and turned on the camera. By the way, I own about 6 other digital cameras, so I can tell what the buttons do from their icons or labels, and I can use intuition to assume what they do. The buttons and operation are quite intuitive, and this is a credit to Kodak. The joy stick for menu selections is quite small, and it's easy to push wrongly and select an unwanted option. People with large fingers or not very dexterous will have issues with this type of control.I took about 10 pictures just to try the camera out. Most of the pictures were surprisingly good, but I can tell I'll have to try the many different scene options before I can take pictures reliably. There was some blurriness and fuzziness visible in several of the pictures, which i attribute to indoor light and my shaky hands, I suppose. I will try tomorrow under sunlight conditions.The lack of an AC adapter in the package should be considered carefully by people who travel, especially if they do so without a computer at hand. True, you can buy an adapter from Kodak, but you will have to pay premium and hope there isn't a run on their stock. The camera is not recognized as a removable drive on your Windows XP, so, you will have to use the Kodak software to deal with your stored pictures until you load and save them elsewhere.

Before making the purchase I researched compact digital cameras for several weeks comparing specs, sample photos and videos. I wanted compact camera that makes decent photos and HD video using H.264 codec. I have Canon Optura 60 camcorder and found inconvenient carrying both camera and camcorder everywhere I go.I started my research with Canon and found several excellent Canon compact cameras (SD990, SD890 and some others).  They make good quality pictures (for compact of course), have good lenses, optical IS, good and conveniently placed viewfinder, convenient and extensive controls. But Canons do not make HD video. Another less important problem was omnipresent Canon menu system that honestly sucks. I already tired using it on Optura so did not want that pain anymore. And Canon designs are neither slick nor elegant.  But if I needed only still photos I would definitely choose one of small high-end Canon because of picture quality, features and lenses.Sony photos have quality not as good but similar to Kodak. But Sony cameras do not do HD video, and another weakness is overpriced memory stick. In other words Sony does not worth all the money they ask for their products anymore.I skipped Olympus and other niche brand just because I did not hear anything interesting about them. Nikon does not offer HD video. Casio makes gadgets - they make decent calculators but I would stay away from cameras made by Casio (BTW I have Casio keyboard)Another option I was seriously considering was Panasonic TZ5. It is a compact, but it is not pocket camera (what is not a problem for me). I found it kind of cheap feeling and it does not look pretty either. But TZ5 makes pretty good HD videos. My problem with Panasonic was that sound quality was tinny (bad) compared with higher quality on Kodak. But the main problem was that Panasonic encodes video using JPEG codec (requires less processing power than H.264) like on Mini DV camcorders. Even VGA resolution videos have almost the same size as HD 720p made on Kodak.  It means extra GBs of memory (1/2-hour video size in H.264 format is about 3.5 GB so for Panasonic you have to multiply it at least by two if not by three). With Optura 60 I have constantly re-encode videos from JPEG motion on tape to H.264 or MPEG-2 to watch them on computer or DVD player. Any re-encoding means video quality deterioration. And besides photos made on Panasonic look lifeless and flat. Panasonic makes good camcorders but I am not so sure about still images.Now back to Kodak V1253. I was also considering Kodak v1273 - a newer model with optical IS. It has cool modern design, touch screen (which is not so good) but sound is mono. The main reason why I chose V1253 over V1273 is HD720p videos with stereo soundtrack. And I have to tell you that stereo sound on V1253 is pretty good - there is more stereo than in more expensive Canon Optura 60 camcorder. When I learned that Kodak discontinued V1253 I rushed to buy it because was afraid they will not make stereo cameras anymore.V1253 is solidly built and looks stylish. There is a big wide aspect screen on the back. It does not have dedicated charger - and I like this fact very much. It can be easily charged from the laptop, which always travels with me and never gets turned off (charge continues even after laptops goes into sleep mode). It is no different from charging MP3 player, which I regularly do. The advantage is that you do not pay extra cash for useless junk like dedicated AC adaptor - I have too many already that I do not use. AC adapter for mobile devices should be thing of the past. But if you do not feel comfortable - you can always buy AC adaptor with USB output, which costs only $9. Kodak makes one - you can buy in Best Buy for $10 (what I did just in case) and use it to charge any USB based device. And there are adaptors that charge several devices at the same time - with 2, 3 or 4 USB ports.Kodak V1253 controls are convenient. I especially like small joystick on the back. Dedicated review and menu buttons are convenient too. Menu system is fabulous - very easy to use and understand especially if you used to suffer from atrocious menu system designed by Canon.Video quality is pretty good. It is not the full HD, only 720p, but to make excellent quality video you have to buy camcorder, not available on still cameras yet. In fact it is so good that I have to put my Canon Optura 60 to the rest. It is true that Optura has less noise and smooth 60 fps video quality - but it lacks in resolution and colors (because of re-encoding from JPEG motion to MPEG-2). So for some time I will use V1253 as a camcorder replacement until I buy new flash memory based camcorder, which also makes good photos, at least 5 mega-pixels.Photos made by V1253 have typical Kodak quality. It means excellent color rendition - after all Kodak sets standard in this area. But as in case with all pocket cameras 9-12M does not really mean 9-12 mega-pixels - there are no details. It will look good on HDTV or computer screen and on printed form, but if you zoom in you will see all kind of noise and artifacts. Small lenses have good quality (distortions are not noticeable) but add to more noise (even though sensor is not small). And as with all Kodak cameras there is a problem with over-compression of JPEG files. The bad thing is that there is no way to change compression settings. I am not even talking about raw images. But at least they should give user the choice to make higher quality photos. I tried different compression methods and even in most compressed scenario file size still was bigger than I got in Kodak. And who cares these days about file size - quality is more important. Kodak has to fix this issue otherwise they cannot compete.Also compared to Canon Kodak oversaturated and over sharpens photos. Of course pictures look pretty until you pay close attention. In menu you can choose different mode but it does not help much.My next step is to try Kodak HD theatre. It is HD player optimized for photos and videos but can also play you-tube videos from Internet and streaming from laptop. I read good reviews about it, about speed sensitive remote (that allows to use it as a mouse on TV screen) and about quality of rendition. My Samsung HDTV has USB port but photos are rendered oversaturated and you cannot changed that, it does not play videos and user interface is a monstrosity to say the least - it is simply impossible for human being to use it. I also have Sandisk card player, but it has composite output only, does not playback videos, looks and feels cheap, very slow and etc. I am going to put all my stuff on external HDD and attach it to Kodak HD theatre. This way I can also get rid of DVDs. Currently I have to create DVDs to watch my videos. I think it is already obsolete approach when there are devices like Kodak HD theatre, Apple TV", "Date": "January 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Still Best Bang For Your Buck", "Author": "Eric C.

After installing I began to test the camera's features, most notably the HD video. Unfortunately I was instantly disapointed. The level of visible noise while filming in standard 720p was terrible. When switching to HQ 720p, the quality improved, but the alloted time on a 2Gb memory card dropped to a paltry 16 minutes. A SDHC card could boost it up to 4Gb or even 8Gb and a much more acceptable 32-64 mins. Please note: Unless you update to the latest version of Quicktime, you will get choppy video playback, as it needs the most recent codec. I updated, and the video quality was still far below what I expected.My dissapointment continued when I discovered that one of the most prized features for me, being able to zoom while recording video, was completely negated upon the discovery that the audible noise from the zoom lens extending and retracting is picked up by the stereo microphones. On the video playback, you can hear a VERY loud buzzing of the lens as it zooms.Needless to say, although this camera's specs look good on paper, it's actual performance is subpar in the video field. As far as the photo quality goes, I didn't look to much. The video was such a turn off, that I knew I would be returning it for another model or brand.One thing I did notice while trying out the photos, was the face recognition software is still getting worked out. Basically I felt that the camera was forcing itself to find a face when one was not there. Like when taking a picture of my living room, it found faces in the couch and lamp.Kodak flaunts this as a great camera for video (that's what the \"V\" in V1253 stands for), however, if you are looking for a good photo camera, this might be good, but if you are like me, and were looking for a digital camera that could act as a camcorder also, you will be dissapointed.", "Date": "November 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good idea poorly executed", "Author": "tesg", "ReviewID": "R2ZZK7TQQMIB92", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera has two huge things going against it...ease of use and (unchangeable) amount of compression.Do NOT expect to take this thing out of the box and shoot good pictures.  There's a serious learning curve here before you're taking non-blurry pictures (don't even think about using this at night without a tripod.)  Even after a hundred shots, I have managed but a dozen or so decent shots.  If you leave the ISO at auto, darker shots will end up with a LOT of noise.  In doing photos of holiday light displays, I discovered in a display of animals made out of lights that it's possible to confuse this camera into being completely out of focus with some things.After uploading files to my hard drive, I noticed the Kodak picture files (at 9MP 16x9 setting) were about the same file size as the 5MP pictures from my trusty Canon Powershot S50.  That's a LOT of compression, and it shows.  Comparing photos at actual size resulted in a lot of flaws in the images in comparison to my Canon.  The 720 \"HQ\" video is no different.  I have to wonder how much better the image quality would be if they'd lay off the compression ratio.The video can be decent if you stick the camera on a tripod and your target isn't moving a lot.  It still looks mostly like standard camcorder video in the end...just camcorder video that happens to fill an HD screen.  I suggest setting auto focus to \"Single AF\" for video...\"Continuous AF\" results in the camera continuing to try to focus on things, making everything OUT of focus most of the time.  I also recommend setting Image Stabilizer off...it seems to break up the picture when panning...but you can't permanently set that, you have to do it each time you turn on the video function.Battery life is less than ideal, and there's no viewfinder, and therefore no option to turn off the LCD.  The camera also has an annoying green diode on the front that comes on in varying degrees of brightness depending on what you're doing (in the case of pictures, people in neighboring states should be able to see it), but it's recessed a bit so I'm hoping to find some hobby store filler to cover it with.I DO like the LCD screen, most of the menu layout, and the size and feel of the unit.

I bought the Kodak v1253 with high hopes of owning a camera that could capture reasonable 720p video.  I use my old Sony T1 primarily as video camera, and was looking forward to improving the quality of my home movies.  Well, this camera CAN capture HD video. Unfortunately, Kodak has saddled the device with a highly compressed video format, further complicated by wrapping the format in a mov container, that requires a super-computer to playback.I've tried playing the video on both my XP (Athlon 3000 dual core) and a Vista (Duo-Core) machines, and neither of these systems can play back the video without stuttering ... a lot.  I've been forced to convert the video into easier-to-playback MPEG formats using Adobe Premiere, a tedious conversion process that takes about 30 minutes of computer time for every minute of video.The end result is \"technically high-definition,\" but doesn't look hugely improved from my Sony camera's standard definition video when played back on my 1080p television.  It's better ... but not enough to warrant all the work convertina and editing it.This is my first attempt using a Kodak camera, and I found the experience pretty frustrating. It is a slow camera, with a delay after each photograph as you watch a gray screen as the image is written to the SD card.  This seems to occur even with fast cards, and even with the latest firmware.  I've never experienced this kind of delay with Sony or Canon cameras before, so it seems very odd to me.  Perhaps you Kodak users are used to this? I've mainly used canon and sony cameras in the past, and am not used to this.Also, there doesn't seem to be a way of reviewing photos on the lcd without extending the lens ... so, if you just want to show a friend some photos directly from the camera, you better watch your hand because that lens is going to extend whether you want it to or not.The LCD on the back seems ok, but most of the time you want to capture the highest megapixel possible, and the 12mp format doesn't conform to the 16x9 ratio of the LCD.  So, a large portion of the LCD goes unused. The \"actual used\" lcd resolution does not seem to be as good as the competition.Finally, I've never had a camera \"lock up\" on me.  The camera will occasionally freeze if you hit any buttons while it's writing to the flash card.  The screen blanks, the lens stays stuck out, and you have to remove the battery and replace it before it will reset.  Really, really weird.I guess I'll stick with the Sony for now, as I can edit the Sony's MPEG1 video in real-time, without any rerendering, with direct MPEG splicing software like Womble. Plus, the MPEG1 video that sony camera's generate will play on virtually any computer in the world without heavy processing power and without having to install software or special codecs.  They will also playback in PowerPoint without a hitch.I had considered buying the Kodak camera for my parents as an easy point-and-shoot with the ability to film video. However, the video component of this camera let me down, as I'm SURE my parents computer won't be able to handle playback of the video.So, get the Kodak if you have a really fast system, don't share videos with family members on slower systems, and don't need to edit video.

This is what did help with the blurry, grainy pix. . . turn off your camera and take out the memory card.  Now, take a picture using the internal memory.  When I did this, I saw a remarkable difference in my picture quality. I was so relieved because then I knew the problem wasn't with the camera.  I finally had a sharp, clear picture once again!  I had not formatted my new memory card. I thought you just bought one and put it in the camera!  I missed so many great shots over the holidays because of my own dumbness, how frustrating!  Now, reinsert the memory card into the camera and format it by first pushing the Menu button, then go to Setup, then scroll down until you come to Format.

Takes incredible pics, manual modes, etc.  But, couldn't take it running around Disney w/Nephew.  Needed 1 thin enough for pocket w/out sacrificing quality.  This cam was the 1st that satisfied my reqs (& many more).  Glass German lens (my plastic lens Canon badly distorts edges - gave my thin gfrnd HUGE ankles), focus assist lamp, Li-ion batt, Image Stabilization, & VERY thin.  Also has HD still & Video, 12 Mpx! (9 for HD, but that's gr8!), TONS of presets (more than my Z712 + Programmable!), almost as many digi-feats as Z712 (minus some man sttngs & exposure bracketing 3-shot feature, which I can live w/out 4 my \"pocket cam\").  Oh, also, stereo mics!  Not sure how much that will matter, but it might get a bird chirping left & a brook babbling right.  Can run on ordinary(non-USB) AC adapter.  Controls are great & sensibly laid-out.  NO Click-WHEEL!!!  Features used most or need to change quickly either have their own instant buttons or 1-move \"joystick\" access.  HUGE 3.1\" screen's AWESOME!  Comes w/rchrgbl Li-Ion batt (expected it seperately).  Was worried it would drain batt quickly, so I ordered a spare.  One lasted all day everyday, even on \"photo day\", on which I took ~40-50 shots not cntng retakes & we reviewed often.  For LOTS of retakes or vid, you may need a spare (online $20, $30+tx BestBuy) or use AC Adptr for indoor shots/vid.  You have FOUR(4) rchrgng opts:  Ord. AC Adapter, Outlet w/USB AC Adptr, Kodak's universal Li-ion chrgr, OR computer USB.  Accdng to Universal chrger sheet, this batt is highest capacity in 700X family (1000 mAh).  Lasts longer than expected, considering HUGE screen (has screen dimmer, comes set to 10 secs, I changed to 20 which only affects batt life for lots of pics).Bought this for Disney trip.  Since I was already familiar w/Kodak's cams, really gave it a good test run.  As most reviewers have said, it takes Incredible pics & vid!  Didn't have trouble learning how to take pics w/it as 1 reviewer said (Kodak familiarity makes no diff - just used auto sttngs when just taking pics & not testing).  Took daytime, nighttime, rain, sunshine, inside w/out flash, even on a roller coaster (got 2 great shots but won't try that again!).  All shots came out unbelievably beautifully (except 1, but cam has mode for that situation - see below).  As with any cam, have to allow it to focus & understand how auto-focus in general works (but can set this cam on continuous focus so don't have to do the \"press half-way\" step).  Also have to hold any cam still or set it down in limited lighting (but this cam has several presets for night & high ISO - I took GREAT night shot of Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 & panoramic of it - this cam has an amazing \"panoramic-stitch\" mode that works seamlessly).  Auto-focus modes for specific situations(central-focus, multi-face detection on/off, multi-zone, etc.) and narrow exposure modes (that allow for someone in shade w/sunshine around them or slightly broader sensing range as well) that you can adjust <> with joystick.  But didn't bother chngng sttngs in the parks & only had 1 pic that would have required it (shade w/sunshine).  Rest all came out beautifully!  Has a great \"Help\" feature that tells you about every feature (just move the zoom control).  Tells enough detail to be helpful.NOW, FOR THE BAD NEWS . . . a case of great cam w/BAD firmware (program that runs everything).  Fortunately, Kodak has a new firmware download (website address - in the manual).  Had several of the same probs reviewers mentioned the 1st day! (EXTRA slow after-shot processing sometimes, corrupted photos when I didn't wait until the screen came back to press a button, and it totally locked-up - unresponsive w/power on - twice . . . just take batt out & back in).  Downloaded the new firmware that night (1st update EasyShare software on Kodak's site, then download firmware program, connect cam to computer's USB, select cam in EasyShare software, then click firmware update button - took ~5 secs to upload to cam).  Fixed everything EXCEPT (LISTENING KODAK?), corrupted photos when you press a button B4 finished processing.  I HOPE Kodak will fix that soon & get a firmware release out.  But, I have to say, you can live w/that by just not interrupting the cam while processing.  It takes longer than my Z712, which only has to process 7.1 Mpx and is done B4 I could even press a button, but I noticed it doesn't affect speed of burst shots or vid, so if you want several shots in rapid succession, use them.  If you can live with that, it's an Incredible cam and the $179 price is the deal of the century.UPDATE:  2 things worth adding:  1) As mentioned, they've put lots of thought into controls.  On top, buttons for Favorites (fave pics), Video, Auto/Preset Smart Scenes, and Power (& Flash Select).  Turns out, Faves, Vid, and Scene are hot-wired, so if the cam's off just press any of them and it turns on in that mode!  Great for spontaneous/shoot-quick moments.  2) Lighting compensation settings.  If you've ever taken indoor shots of some item(like for eBay) that end up looking yellow because of incandescent lighting or flat (fluorescent), you'll love this (and that this tiny cam has it).  Compensates for several others too.  I'm loving this cam.  Been using it all the time.

I wanted to find something smaller and never actually considered a point and shoot camera but wow was I supprised by this one. The pictures are fantastic and the HD video is great as well.Now the video is not quite as good as my Sanyo but it is very good and the pictures that the Kodak takes cannot be compared to. The camera does work very well in low light for video. Very important for me.The sound is truely stereo. I also love the fact that this camera is much slimmer than the Sanyo and does not get caught on door ways as I walk through them.Ok now the bad. The battery must be charged through a small adapter and plugged into the USB port and the computer must be on for the camera to charge. The adapter is small and can, no will get lost easily. This adapter must also be used to download to the computer. In the video mode you will get lens flare or purple fringing if you are looking at bright light in its view.

The ONLY function for which this camera is superior is Video.  In all other areas, it is an inferior camera.The MAIN downfall to this camera is the ports and lack of an AC Charger. You're supposed to charge it with a USB cable, not an AC charger, yet the camera has an AC charger port and NO USB Port! So, you have to carry around the proprietary Kodak cable and charge it via a computer. I personally don't wish to use the Easyshare connection, and prefer to just take the SD card out and plop it my their computer or card-reader. So, I'd prefer to have a charger (which you can buy separately for like $40.)I work for a community media organization where we all have cameras like this, and I can attest that the video (especially the audio that accompanies the video) on this camera is superior to any camera I've seen (besides camcorders).  Also, they don't promote it, but the 3-picture panorama feature on the Kodak EasyShare's is uniquely easy and incredible and makes for some of the most simple and unique pictures I've seen (it automatically stiches 2 or 3 pictures together in a seamless panorama/wide-screen shot that looks cinematic and beautiful).All in all, I'd say this camera is only the right choice for you if you plan to use it for a lot of video blogging.

This time we made sure it is safe from the kids. My husband had been particularly careful handling it (it was expensive at $297 bought at Best Buy!) but suddenly, it would have lots of horizontal white lines when taking photos, worse when outdoors using natural light! I tried to check the photos by inserting the SD card to my printer slot, and they were still there (so it was not the LCD that was the problem). The troubleshooting page of Kodak determined the problem as something I could not fix and that they would have to repair for FREE since it was within warranty.

Took over a year to sort it out with Kodak (7 returns) before they sent us a new camera.  The v1253 is glitchy.  Won't even work with some of the new Kodak branded memory cards.  Kept getting file write errors.  Aside from the last person we talked to for Kodak support (an American in Rochester, NY) Kodak support is everyone's outsourced nightmare.  Long holds, repeating things on the screen over and over, mis-information.  I didn't get to talk to the American until three weeks after Kodak had my camera for the last time. I had already given up on it and bought an Olympus DSLR E-410. Don't buy this or any other Kodak cameras, unless you want a big headache when they break in less than a month.Camera will occasionally extend the lens and not turn on the rest of the way, thus making you remove the battery and put it back in (this also resets the clock, which you must set before taking a picture).Camera has a stuck pixel right in the middle of the screen. Nice bright blue.Compression on pictures is way too high - don't expect to print anything other than 4\" x 6\" prints - ever.  My six year old Sony 3.2 MP takes better quality pictures.Movie quality is so-so. You better have a brand new computer if you want to playback the HD setting. By the way, you'll need to convert it to a more usable format for any Video software to be able to use it.You must charge it from the computer's USB port - there is no included charger.NO Manual controls over aperture and shutter speeds.Pros:Fits in my pocket.Pictures are well processed in the camera - good light processing well balanced.Relatively quick power up to take a picture time - about a second.Battery life is pretty good for that big screen", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed!", "Author": "P.

In fact, if I had a 30 day return policy on my camera and not a 14 day return policy, I may very well have taken it back.  Not 100% sure, but maybe.In short, the camera does take excellent pictures and yes, the video, in HD quality, is very impressive. But there are a few personal observations that detract from that general statement. For example:1] HD video.  Impressive, no doubt.  Now try to watch that file on anything less than a new computer.  I have an AMD Athlon 64 3000+ with 2GB RAM and a Radeon 9700 PRO video card and I could NOT play the video back using the included Quicktime software!!!!  The video and audio would stutter all over the place.  I was astonished.  I literally thought I had a defective camera.  I tried it on my IBM R51 laptop at work.  No good either.  Now admittedly, a Core 2 Duo processor would not have an issue with this.  But that's not what Kodak's website says.  It says you only need a 600 MHz processor or better.  Not true if you are talking about video playback.  No way, no how.  I finally downloaded GOM Media Player and installed QTLite and I was able to play back my video on a few different computers including a Fujitsu P1610.  But that was a very disappointing experience.  Kodak technical support was not helpful on this matter and told me that they were beginning to receive complaints and were considering a change to their \"recommended minimum\" description.  I'll believe it when I see it.  On the other hand, if you have a reasonably new system, you shouldn't have an issue with this.2] Speed between pictures.  There is no doubt that this camera is simply slow going from one picture to the next.  The delay is 2-3 seconds per shot and it quickly becomes noticeable.  The firmware update to 1.01 does little to nothing to resolve this.  I wondered if this was a result of the memory card.  Maybe it needs a class 6 card to move the pictures quickly.  Well, don't ask Kodak.  They can't even tell you if their own camera supports the higher speeds.  In fact, it took a 30 minute conversation just to find out they the camera currently supports a 4GB SDHC card as a max.  They offer no information on what class is supported or recommended other than to recommend their own Kodak 2GB SD card.  I have a 4GB Patriot SD card that came out before the SDHC specification was set.  Its performance speed easily meets a class 6 memory card.  So unless there is something very particular about the Patriot 4GB SD, the fault remains with the camera.Other minor negatives that have been mentioned by others:- Lack of an AC adapter.  It really is stupid.  That's just being horribly cheap.- The camera does freeze up at times.  The only way to undo it is to remove the battery and then you have to reset the date and time again.  Minor, but annoying.That said, the camera does have some impressive specifications and I personally find its user interface to be clear, uncluttered and simple.  That's one of the main reason I wanted to buy a Kodak.  They have a good reputation (to me) for providing the consumer with a high quality camera that is not overly complicated.  In that, they succeed.I still consider myself a novice in picture taking though and I need to learn a lot more about how to better setup shots, how to make effective use of the ISO settings and flash, etc.  I've owned several digital cameras over the years, so I know the real power still resides on the person behind the camera, not simply the camera.I will say that I was originally looking for a less expensive camera.  Several of the Canon cameras caught my eye.  But the fact that this Kodak unit could handle HD video really caught my attention.I'm not completely disappointed in the purchase.
