My previous and current equipment includes Mamiya 645 Pro TL, Zenza Bonica ETRSII, Canon EOS 850 film (retired), Konica film (retired), Olympus C3030 (point and shoot donated) and various other equipment over the years.  I still own and use my Nikon D70s and find it to be a wonderful tool, but the D2Xs is the ulitmate machine at this time, in my opinion.I read many articles and reviews about professional level digital SLR cameras, and I was a little aprehensive about the D2Xs because I wasn't sure I could justify it.  I find this camera is actually easier to use than other equipment I've owned.  If you're an amateur stepping up to a pro body, remember there are no pre-programmed (i.e., landscape, portrait, night landscape, etc.) settings like on the D70s or the Canon.  That forces you to use the M, P (most automatic settings) or aperture/shutter preferred options.  I find it pretty straight forward, since the pre-programmed settings can be a little confusing in their own right.This camera is big but feels very steady to use.  Ergonomics are supreme, and the menus (not used that often since every key setting is selectable with a button) are easy to read in bright sunlight.This is a very well done product that takes pictures capable of being blown up to poster size without a problem or loss of quality.  This is a beautiful piece of gear if you can afford it.  I chose it between the Canon Mark's and other options in the 12+MP range because I liked it best of all.", "Date": "April 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Megapixels don't matter.", "Author": "teapotbaker", "ReviewID": "RRQ73VKKC8PR5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As an enthusiast, i was really impressed with the image & build quality of the D7000.

The D2Xs is in an entirely different league. Mostly, one has a lot of superlatives and a few quibbles to say about the D2Xs. The one drawback to the D2Xs is that as a Nikon professional product, pretty much everything that is an accessory specific to the D2** line is priced professionally, too.The Nikon D2Xs uses a 12MP Sony imager. The color performance of the imager is neutral and has good color accuracy. If you like eye-popping color, be prepared to do a fair amount of post-processing. The dynamic range is good, being slightly wider than one may be used to from shooting slide film. Even Fine JPEG output results in files that withstand fair amounts of digital editing without horrid artifacts. The custom color balance facility is excellent, and should be used for any situation that does not fit one of the preset color balance options. The automatic white balance works for some mixed lighting conditions, but not others. Checking a test shot is prudent for any critical work.The D2Xs has reasonable noise characteristics, though outdone by the D3 line. I commonly use up to ISO 800 for shooting action without qualms. If shooting for enlargements over 8x10\", though, you will likely want to use lower ISO settings. The ISO range above 800 produces prominent noise, requires careful attention to exposure, and noticeably reduces resolution of images.The D2Xs has a \"crop mode\" that yields about half the currently-set megapixels per image. I have found this useful for dog sport action photography, as the maximum frame rate increases from 5 fps to 8 fps when in crop mode. When one does not intend maximum-size enlargements, crop mode becomes a handy tool. The reduced taking area is masked in the viewfinder with selection of crop mode. Essentially, Nikon obviated most needs for the D2Hs camera by providing crop mode on the D2Xs. It provides a frame rate on a par with the D2Hs in this mode, though it reduces the view angle of whatever lens is attached. The D2Xs can thus perform almost all the functions of the D2Hs as well as its own.The D2Xs has typical Nikon pro build quality. This means environmental seals to help deal with inclement weather and bad locations, a strong metal frame, and heavy-duty user control interfaces. It also means it is a heavy camera. I'm 6'3\" and about 200#, and this camera is a bit taxing to carry around for me. Especially when paired with a killer lens like the Nikkor 70-200mm VR, one is talking about serious weight. I commonly use at least a monopod if I will be taking photos for any extended length of time.What Nikon has provided over the years are ergonomics suited to the professional photographer. Most of the things that are needed for shot-to-shot adjustment on the D2Xs have operable controls or at least dedicated menus, as in the ISO, quality, and color balance controls on the rear of the camera. The menu system allows a plethora of tuning adjustments to the behavior of the camera and how the images are produced and processed. Despite the ultimate complexity, I was able to get acquainted with my D2Xs within a couple of days and successfully shot a day-long event with it. Thus the four stars on \"ease of use\" reflects the steep initial learning curve and the ready-to-hand character of daily operation.One of the deciding factors for me on going to the D2Xs back in 2006 was the presence of a voice memo function. There is a dedicated button on the rear of the camera and a microphone there as well. One can choose whether the camera automatically starts a voice memo with every picture or whether a memo will be taken only when manually requested. The recording shares the name of the image it is associated with and the \"WAV\" extension. For anyone who is taking a day's worth of event photos, this is a godsend, and was only available at the time on the Nikon pro \"Dn\" line, not any of their pro-sumer and consumer DSLRs. Nor had Fuji carried over voice memo from the S2 to the S3 or S5. If I take photos at, say, a Vizsla dog show, where every dog looks more or less like every other dog there, the voice memo can let me say the name of the current dog or capture an announcer doing that. The audio quality of the monoaural recordings made by the voice memo function is surprisingly good, and the microphone is pretty sensitive, allowing one to capture background sound easily.While an inspired photographer can make art with a Holga point-and-shoot, the inspired photographer will find in the Nikon D2Xs a complement to achieve images with the highest technical perfection as well. What it takes away are excuses for sub-par performance.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Investment", "Author": "Christopher OConnor \"GC Photographers\"", "ReviewID": "R22LU570F20PZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I know how to get good deals on the D2x and D2xs.

Otherwise, some flaws.", "Author": "M. Bahnson \"Stuffitus\"", "ReviewID": "RUUZE0FPWS6BD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an outstanding camera. There is no question about that.I have been using this body now for approximately 2.5 years. I know this camera inside and out; I know it well and use it daily.  That being said, I would like to first emphasize that some of the best cameras in the world are capable of taking lousy pictures, and some of the more worthless throw away cameras have captured some quite breathtaking pictures, so let's try to stay technical, because that's what you want anyway right? The specs and how they translate to the user.So, here's the meat:The Good1. Outstanding ergonomics. The size and shape of the body make for speedy operation, comfortable long term use and little fatigue relating to the actual ergonomics. (it's heavy as a brick so you'll get fatigued, but not from the shape or size, just the weight.) I can shoot all day without a strap if I have to.2. Durability is amazing. I haven't put mine to the test from a durability standpoint because I tend to baby my equipment; however, I know the magnesium alloy construction combined with the water resistance will allow for even the most disturbing of abuses.3. Speed. If you know what you're doing with this camera, you can get in, get the shot and get out without any problem. That's the main reason to have a Pro size body in the first place. A button for every feature that you can access quickly and easily to make sure you aren't fiddling with menus while the perfect opportunity for a shot passes you by. Not to mention the speed of the continuous shooting mode. If you want that high speed crop function on, you can crank out a ton of images really quickly if need be.4. Flexibility and user preferences. Though this feature is not really unique to this body, the ability to program the camera to behave a certain way in a certain situation is very handy. I have programmed mine in 4 different modes, Casual Shooting, Outdoor Action, Portraits, & Full Blown Auto. Plenty of people out there wear the T-shirt that says \"I shoot Manual.\" Well, I set the camera up the way I want it to take the pictures before I pull any triggers, and then I shoot pictures. I don't typically shoot Manual anymore, the camera knows more about focusing and metering than I do, why not let the expert (the body) be in charge of those functions?5. The viewfinder! If there's one feature on a pro Nikon body that I can't do without anymore, it's the large viewfinder. I know there are plenty of other bodies out there that have \"100% coverage\" viewfinders which doesn't really mean squat to me if I can barely get my eye in there to compose the shot. With the big viewfinder, you can leave your glasses on in bright sunlight, you can leave your goggles on in harsh cold, you can finally compose without squinting and removing your eye to put it in the tiny little square hole in the back of some smaller bodies.6. Battery life. Holy cow! I can easily crank out 3500 images on a single charge. No matter that lens or lighting condition, the battery just keeps going and going. I bought this camera used, and the battery had about 90% life left in it and it's been 2.5 years, it's still at 90%. I don't know how it does it, maybe it's the conditioning feature on the charger, but this battery is amazing. (I guess that's why replacements are $100)The Bad1. Low light performance. If you're going to be shooting concerts at night, indoors in dim light or any other situation that may require higher ISOs, you may not be pleased with the noise produced above ISO800 or so. I know ISO1600 is the new ISO200 and any camera that can't shoot at 1600 is rubbish now, but, I come from a film background, I'm fine with ISO800. You can easily (subjective) get around the low light performance limitations of this body by investing in some outstanding glass. Don't take a 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G kit lens to a concert expecting this body to produce amazing, motionless, sharp and brilliant shots. You really need to gather as much light ahead of time as you can, you don't do that by just cranking up ISO. You do that by giving your camera's sensor a bigger hole to peek through.2. LCD screen. At just 2.5\", it leaves something to be desired. You'll find yourself zooming in on the image nearly every time just to get a close inspection of it and you'll tell yourself in your head, \"I guess I'll have to see that one on the computer\" a number of times before you get used to how pictures look on this small screen. It's not very dynamic and it's pretty small, but, it does the job.3. Focus tracking. You really have to pay close attention to what you're shooting, where it's moving and where the new destination is in relation to your current focus point if you want the camera to even come close to \"tracking\" your target. By today's standards, it's an ancient system, but, it was advanced for its time, but still flawed. The camera's focusing system can be tricked pretty easily and (especially with D lenses) you'll find yourself bouncing back and forth between target and its background if you're not precisely aiming your focal highlights.4. The D-Pad. Wobbly and difficult to actually press \"Select\" by pushing straight In, not Down. This has since been re-designed in the newer cameras, it's no longer a D-Pad, it's a ring with an actually button in the center.5. USB 1.1. Lame, fail. USB 2.0 has been around for a long time. Transferring 400 20Mb RAW files via USB 1.1 just plain sucks. Obviously taking the CF card out and putting it in a higher speed reader is the solution, but that doesn't change the fact that the body is crippled with USB 1.1.6. Crop sensor. A full sized professional body with a crop sensor? Really? Given the amount of room this body has inside it wouldn't have been that much of a jump to cram a FX sensor in there rather than the crop sensor. Given the crop factor, this could have easily been the best camera ever produced at the time with amazing 18MP detail and huge dynamic range...but, they didn't. Oh well. If you want a full frame sensor, you should probably look at the 8 other bodies Nikon offers in a FX.OverallThis has been the best camera I have ever owned or even used. I have taken some spectacular shots with it and plan to keep it for quite a while longer. I would love to have the D3S someday, but, that's money I could be putting towards better glass for my existing camera. If you want to experience pro level functionality, ergonomics and durability, this is a great starting point. This camera was the best in its class for a while, and is still a fantastic competitor for overall quality.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Little Confused", "Author": "jszee", "ReviewID": "R30IMYN7X0S19D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned the D2x  for several years.

I also bought the underwater housing for it almost emmediately. The Austrian housing manufacturer, Subal, had used the nearly identical body and controls of Nikon's D2H to develop a housing for the D2X before it had even shipped.The results of those initial dives made me very happy. I was impressed first with the D2X's image quality, a massive jump, over the previous digital SLR, a Nikon D100. The D2X is better pixel-to-pixel than the D100 by a clear margin, and it's got twice as many of those pixels.Another thing that I think is a massive advantage to the D2X is the large viewing screen. Even inside the housing, it's easy to see in good detail, which allows me to make faster and more definitive judgments about my images.
