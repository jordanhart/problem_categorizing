To appreciate the value of this item, you have to acknowledge its limitations which are the same as any budget friendly camera. It will not produce SLR photos; however, it does produce pictures that are as good as any point and shoot compact camera. It rendered excellent outdoor photos, still and sport. The indoor photos were good. I did adjust some settings to get the results that I desired, but it was super easy. The camera is very user friendly. If you approach your purchase of this camera with a realistic expectation of its capabilities, you will enjoy it.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "ktpickle", "ReviewID": "RRSU2K2LCS6FM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a small, easy to use camera that would easily fit in a pocket or small purse to take on our trip to Disney.

Rehm", "ReviewID": "R3SHPB6N64KHW3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the AX550 for about $80 and added a $7 memory card. My previous cameras were a couple of $130 Kodak M1033's (I now know why they went out of business) and a great $280 Panasonic Lumix that I dropped in a lake. With the simple shots I take, I didn't need anything more expensive than this Fujifilm. Out of the box, it's simple, intuitive and easy to set up and use. I did read the paper manual for a few tips, but probably didn't need to if I'd taken more time to play with the camera. I'm no engineer like a previous reviewer, so I don't have a particular mind set about how something should operate. I just like simple, and this camera is just that. I get good photo's that are worthy of framing, depending on the photo paper I use, up to 5X7. Anything beyond that is grainy but  that's what you get from an $80 camera. The movie mode works well and is easy to figure out. Given the cost, it's hard for me to criticize the camera, except to say it's a bit thicker than some and it's slick....hard to hold onto sometimes, but that's a problem I see with most small cameras. Someday there will be a rugged outdoor version that has a rubber-like coating and then I'll be happy. A positive about this model is that it takes AA batteries, inexpensive to replace and available at grocery stores and gas stations everywhere. So, for a simple, decent camera that does not cost much, it's been a good choice for me. I read that some reviewers got a bad AX550, units that had out-of-the-box problems. All I can say is it happens from time to time, but if the manufacturer or the seller warranties it, then it'll all work out. I tried it with Kodak and they still sent bad stuff, so I know it does not always work for the consumer. All in all, I believe this camera is a good one, considering the cost. Namaste....now go take some pictures.", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's not a Nikon D700, but it gets the job done.", "Author": "gaingreene", "ReviewID": "R1OFDN5G2IBOUX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for a decent price! I have bulky professional equipment and don't feel like lugging it across the country for lollapalooza in a few days, besides they wouldn't let me through the gates with my big rig. But Jimminey Christmas this thing has 16mp. Just a few years ago, you couldn't buy a 10mp camera for under $1000. If you are expecting the quality of say a Nikon D700 you will be sorely disappointed. It takes pictures, which is the main goal right? And you don't have to take out a loan at the local S&L; which are being put out of business by Chase and Citibank to get it, by the way.If you are mainly taking pictures at family events or at the club with your girls, then you really don't need more than this. Sure there are better \"built\" cameras out there, but why bother unless you are one of those types of people that have to have the latest and greatest even if your main shooting style is \"Auto.\" Simple, well constructed and affordable!If you need all the bells and whistles in a point and shoot, then you are probably trying to impress someone who really doesn't care.

It is very small and fits in your shirt pocket and can take digital prints and movies.  It was very easy to use straight out from the package.  There is a 2.7 inch LCD screen for viewing the area to be shot and also to scroll through the menu options for the camera settings.  The camera has 5x zoom feature for close ups.  It also has a scene recognition feature that can be used to take photos.  I used the camera on a vacation trip and it took photos with good resolution (taking photos in low light did not come out too well).  The camera uses two AA size batteries and the power drainage from taking quite a few photos and leaving it in the camera for over a month can require a new set of replacements.  If you do remove them to save power, remember that the date/time settings will need to be readjusted.  Lithium-ion batteries are probably the best if you want a power source that will last longer.  The camera was very easy to use and is a good entry level camera to the world of digital photography.  I purchased mine during a Black Friday sale for $39.99.  And that was less than the price of my previous 35mm camera from the 1990s (with less features too).  I later also purchased the Fuji camera that uses lithium-ion batteries that has similar features as this model.  That model, JX580, cost $59 during a liquidation sale.", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "AX560 great general purpose camera but energy problem", "Author": "Mark Once", "ReviewID": "R3A1NJGKMWQH5R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera from a box store because I wanted small enough to put in a convoy pocket for every day use.
