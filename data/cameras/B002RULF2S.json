Features that make it very desirable include:  Small and easy to hide, low power,  runs cool, no mechanical disc drive to fail, does not loose it's memory when the power is disconnected, records on motion detection, takes up to a 16 GB SD card, does not need a PC to function, overwrite feature, and can run on battery power.  This DVR has a neat pre record feature that when engaged starts recording the video signal 5 seconds before the motion activation is detected.  This way it catches everything from the start.  Sound feature not used.  Came with a slick little device that will hold the SD memory card and plugs into a USB2 port allowing files to be viewed on a PC.One minor issue not covered in the instructions is when the unit is powered up for the first time and the video output is plugged into a NTSC compatible monitor the picture has a rapid vertical roll to it.  When the unit was tested it was set for PAL compatibility and must be reset for NTSC which can be tricky since the screen is rolling making it hard to read. Going through the following sequence by pressing the keys indicated when you first turn it on it will set it to NTSC.  1. Menu  2. OK  3.  Right Arrow  4.  Right Arrow  5.  OK  6.  Right Arrow  7.  OK.  When the DVR set to PAL is plugged into the color quad processor Real Time Color Digital Quad Processor Security-surveillance or area-monitoring systems with Remote controler DIY QD435 1EYthe picture does not roll but is very low quality until the DVR is changed to NTSC.The settings that work best for me are to record at 5 FPS and not 30 FPS.  Set the motion sensitivity to 7 and the record time to 30 seconds.  Used this way a 16GB card will record about 8 to 10 days worth of movement of street traffic in our neighborhood.", "Date": "November 20, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$71.99", "Features": "4, 8, 16 channel 120 fps\nMPEG4 and motion JPEG Compression, Record Resolutions up to 640 x 480 NTSC\nRecord Mode: motion detection recording / schedule recording / recycling recording method\nRemote connection over TCP/IP.
