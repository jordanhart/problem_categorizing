{"Reviews": [{"Title": "3rd time's a charm- a standing \"O\" for the ZS3!", "Author": "Michael J. Christensen", "ReviewID": "R1UVMHP7BJRBVT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned two prior digital cameras- the first was a Canon that took good pictures, but was too bulky to pocket around and required AA batteries to power it.  The second was a Sony CyberShot DSC-W150 that took crappy, blurry pictures in low light.  Needless to say, I felt an upgrade was in order.So I'm going on an east coast trip next month.  My buddy and I are avid baseball fans.  One problem:  as we do not always have great seats, taking close-up pictures of ballplayers is a real pain with 99% of the compact point and shoots out there.  This is because the camera's size will only allow it 5X optical zoom.  You can combine this with digital zooming, but I don't need to tell you how terrible and pixilated this looks.  Thus my conundrum.  So I really wanted a compact, pocketable camera with a long range optical lens, without having to lug around an expensive digital SLR.Enter the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3.  When I read the specs on it, I was in awe.  10 megapixel, 12X OPTICAL zoom.  Here's the sweetest part about the zoom- if you planning to use smaller prints (i.e. 4X6), you can quickly adjust the camera's Megapixel (MP) count from 10 to 7, 5, and 3 to yield maximum OPTICAL zooms of 14.3, 17.1, and 21.4 respectably, without much loss of detail on such prints.  I wish Panasonic would have allowed the camera to adjust the MP count automatically as you zoom, but it's not too much trouble to change the MP settings manually from the quick menu.Another great feature:  the camera's screen is beautiful at 460,000 pixels, twice the count as the rival Canon Powershot SX200 IS (more on that camera later).  From the moment you view your first picture, you'll quickly notice how much sharper photos look on this camera.  It's a nice convenience to view photos on the camera in a manner closer to the quality that will actually be seen when you're viewing them on the computer (and ultimately printing them).I also want to give Panasonic kudos for the build quality and compactness of this camera.  The ZS3 is a replacement for the popular TZ5 model, which was 9MP and 10X Optical Zoom.  So they increased the resolution, and added a wider range lens, and REDUCED the size by .4 cubic inches.  Specifications aside, I was more than pleased that this camera will comfortably fit inside my jeans pocket.  It's a bit bulkier than an ultracompact for sure, but not objectionably so.  Note that the SX200 is a full 2.0 cubic inches thicker, another reason I passed on the Canon.  Here's a few more reasons the Canon falls short:  the Canon has a cheesy looking popup flash that sticks out at the top of the camera, whether you're using flash or not (bad design decision).  It has less rated battery life than the Lumix.  Also, when shooting video, the Canon does NOT allow you to use optical zooming.Photo quality on the Lumix is excellent, although I've only snapped samples around my place so far.  However, I've taken quite a few pictures at low light, and at maximum zoom levels to try to get a bad shot.  So far, there's none to be found.  I'll put this through its paces more when I travel next month, but I'm extremely pleased so far.  As for video shooting, I've sampled it a bit, and it seems pretty solid.  The camera gives you the choice of shooting video in its touted AVCHD Lite format (ideal for watching it on your TV in HD with an optional mini to standard HDMI cable), or JPEG if you prefer to email video clips to friends.  This year's model also added stereo sound on video playback versus last year's monaural effort.  One thing I found a bit strange, was the incredibly slow zooming when shooting video.  I guess Panasonic was trying to give the user a more controlled, deliberate zoom, but unlike the snappy photo zooming, it's a bit slow for my liking.Some other minor quibbles:  The dial that controls the shooting mode is extremely loose.  If you lightly rub it against anything (a camera bag, your pocket), there's a good chance it will shift.  When you turn the camera on, it will digitally tell you what mode you're in, but it's still annoying when it happens by accident.  Second, when making a quick zoom on an object, it will appear blurry on the camera's screen until the shutter button is pressed.  There are modes to continually focus the object when zooming, but this drains the camera's battery life more rapidly.  It would be nice if this feature was incorporated automatically without any such sacrifice.Also, I'm not a huge fan of the included PhotofunStudio software bundled with this camera, as there are other, more compelling programs to view, edit, and print photos (I like Canon's Zoombrowser program better).  Finally, this is not the camera to buy if you're into manual controls.  There's a ton of preset scenes that can be used (nighttime, portrait, baby, sunset, food, etc.), and you can adjust items like flash, white balance, and max ISO level, but this is meant to be a simple point and shoot for casual photographers.  Note that the Lumix has an intelligent auto mode (IA) that will analyze the shooting conditions and pick the right scene, flash, and exposure without any adjustments by the user.  This camera screams simplicity, but there's enough tweaking on the Normal and Scene modes to keep the vast majority of amateur photographers happy.Regardless of these nitpicks, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 is an awesome camera, unbeatable for those that want the best of both worlds- a great zoom lens and compact body.  It's a bit pricey at $399, but you're getting quite a lot of camera for your hard earned dollars.  I have no doubt that my third digital camera is a terrific buy and a long-term staple for my travels.", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Oh my goodness, what a camera!", "Author": "Michael McKee \"mystic cowboy\"", "ReviewID": "R1BL78XJFGBGKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a pro friend who got a review copy of this for a couple of days. He let me use it for one of them, as he hasn't shot with a point and shoot in a long time. I ordered my own within the first hour. What a camera. The zoom on this baby is amazing. It has a true wide angle and a long reach. Photos on both ends of the reach are sharp and have good color and saturation. I almost drooled when I printed out the samples. They are flat out the best point and shoot jpegs that I've had the pleasure of taking. Raw files would be nice but aren't available, nor is much in the way of manual exposure control. As a bit of a control freak, I thought that would be a problem but honestly, Panasonic's smart mode selection is brilliant at getting good, sharp exposures. Focusing is fast, even in low light. Flash seems fine, neither superior nor awful. I took 400 images and a short movie on my first outing and the battery still had some juice. It also has fast and accurate face detection. Holding the camera in my hand, pointing it in the general direction of people on the street without being obvious got consistently good focus. Oh, the image stabilization works very well, too.The camera is just small enough to fit in a shirt pocket but unless you're wearing heavy denim it's just to heavy to be comfortable there. It slips fine in a vest pocket or jacket, though. Point and shoots have definitely improved in low light performance since I bought my last one. I got perfectly usable shots at 400 ISO. A little noise touch up and they print fine at 11x14. At 1600 ISO you can still get a usable Flickr sized image, again with a run through a noise processor like Noise Ninja.It has a new video mode that uses half the memory of the normal mov files that it also supports. But finding where they are on the card is a bit of a treasure hunt the first time. They are also a pain to process. I ran a conversion program to turn them into H.264 format. That makes editing much easier. Do that first thing. You can even run the optical zoom while shooting movies, though focus can be a bit slow. Videos are much better than those from the Flip that is all I own for movies.Great zoom, great photos, great lens, reasonable size, scary accurate automatic mode switching, wow!. If it had a bit more manual control it might be better, then again, I've got a few hundred really nice images.

After reading a couple of reviews and a visit to a local camera store I decided to choose the ZS3 over the competing Canon SX200 IS with very similar features.  Although the Canon is more familiar to me and has more manual features, the compact size of the Panasonic with better battery life, robust video functions and the fact that it's still made in Japan (versus the Canon which is now manufactured in China) edged out the Canon for me personally (you may want to try both to decide for yourself).  So far I have been very happy with this versatile camera - screen is big and bright, facial recognition is neat, zoom is remarkable for a camera of its size and the video quality is excellent for a camera.  Only downside is that like the camera store employee said - the autofocus motors inside the Panasonics do seem to be quite loud - i.e. if you are aiming the camera around randomly you can hear the motors whirling away as it refocuses at different potential targets.  I enjoyed this purchase and I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a easy-to-use, high quality point and shoot with 12x optical zoom.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, few helpful tips", "Author": "A. Scott", "ReviewID": "RWFACO7INU0OA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You really have to work hard to take a bad shot with this camera. Also the 720p HD video is amazing.  Very happy overall.Below I've put together a few notes on getting the most out of the camera and avoiding some of it's minor foibles..It's not as obvious as it should be when video is recording.. I liked my old camera's blinking led.. The ZS3's on screen record indicator(especially when you have the display set to view histogram and a bunch of other info).. is not distinctive enough.  The record button is also not as easy to press as it should be. I may add one of those small little self-adhesive rubbery sticky dots on the button and see if that helps.Highlights can end up clipped in videos(and pictures to a much lesser extent).. This can be fixed by putting camera in \"normal mode\" on the dial and pressing \"up\" on the D-pad. This is the ONLY place you have access to exposure control that works for both video and pictures.  I would recommend -1/3 for pictures and even -2/3 for video.  For some reason the camera is very aggressive at brightening video.. I've taken video of my son playing lacrosse at night on a lighted Football field.. looks almost like broad daylight using default exposure and still clipped the whites even in that low light.One other note on video.. and I was burned by this. When you hit the record/stop button at the end of shooting a video, it does NOT continue to process video left in the buffer.. it just dumps it. That means the actual end of the video is about a half second before when you hit the \"record/stop\" button. I lost one of my son's goals that way.. Hit the button to stop recording right after he scored, and the video ended up clipped right as he was shooting. :(  My old camera had very limited recording length per card(no SDHC support), so I am still a little trigger happy.. will have to adjust for this minor flaw.Video does stutter slightly on panning.. I think this is a function of the imager only recording at 30fps while video is converted to 60fps for AVHDC.. it is either duplicating frames, or averaging one in between which causes it to not be as smooth as I might like in that situation. Seems most noticeable in very bright light with something like bricks in the background. Might try MJPEG mode(30fps only) and see if that changes anything.I was surprised by the camera's focal depth while shooting video. People in the stands right in front of me seemed as clear as the players on the field 50+ yards away even in fairly low light.I also use \"Intelligent ISO800\" in picture mode.. nice feature that boosts ISO automatically when it detects motion in the frame.As for the flash.. which BTW is perhaps the camera's weakest feature.  I find a much cleaner way to deal with turning it on or off, is by using the quick menu and turning Unlimited burst mode on and off.. In burst mode, the flash is forced off. I leave burst mode on most of the time.. you can click and just get one shot, or hold shutter down and snap off a series of quick shots.. Great for group and individual candid photos.Software that comes with the camera is not great..I am using my old Cannon Zoombrowser software for pictures. I am forced for now to use Panasonic's provided software only for video. The Software provided is also far worse at playing back video clips on my slow computer than a couple of other players I use.  Video trimming feature, while nice to have, is counter intuitive.. you select the part of the video you want to delete, and not the part you want to keep.. that threw me for a while. Also frustrating that there is no easy way to rename videos and there's also no way to set a \"star\" or \"favorite\" rating for videos(on or off the camera).Good news is the AVCHD(mt2s) video files can be directly uploaded to YouTube(which will convert them to their HD format for you)Flash burst mode(in scenes) while limited in resolution(3mpix at 3:2) works well for capturing quick snaps of kids playing around in poorly lit rooms.Wide angle really is nice.. so much easier to compose shots than with my old Powershot S2..Can't believe I have so much more resolution, effortless shooting with snappy focus and amazing HD video quality, All in a camera 1/3rd the size and weight and it still has the 12x Zoom. Stuff it in my pocket and take it anywhere.  Good ridance to extra batteries and the \"man purse\" I had to carry with that S2 clunker!  The big bright high res screen on the back is a wonderful addition as well.", "Date": "May 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Five stars if you forgive the chipped battery", "Author": "A. Butterfield", "ReviewID": "R10OEQ02TOP2UQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To get the best photos, you obviously need an SLR and some great lenses. Hmm. Well, I have an SLR and some great lenses, but I tend to leave them at home when I go on a trip.So I bought this TZ7 (which is what it's called in the UK where I got mine - the ZS3 is exactly the same camera) to take with me when I can't be bothered to take my SLR, which is nearly all the time. The TZ7 (ZS3) is small enough to go in a jacket pocket, or to hang unobtrusively from your belt. But is it good enough for anyone used to the quality of an SLR?For me it is good enough, as long as you adjust your expectations. Which you have to do when you have such a small camera with a 25 to 300 zoom. Try getting a 25 to 300 zoom for an SLR! Even more amazing is that it's a very decently sharp lens. It's a little bit less than razor sharp at the extremes of the zoom range, but almost all my shots came out nice and sharp (but not too sharp, meaning the camera isn't over-processing things).So the lens is good, and since the lens is the TZ7's party piece, that's a good thing.Next on the list of killer features is HD video. This is 720p video, not `full' HD, but what do you expect? The great thing is that you can use the optical zoom while taking video, which is rare in these cameras. It zooms slowly so the noise of the zoom isn't picked up by the microphone but works very well. You get stereo sound too, and the quality of the sound is way ahead of any camera like this I've tried before. You might think that you wouldn't get proper stereo with microphones so close together, but it does a decent impersonation of it. Videos look pretty good, with the image stabiliser smoothing things out even at full zoom. Hold it carefully and it looks like you're using a tripod. You will need a decent computer and graphics card to play HD video though, or a compatible HD TV. You may need to buy an HDMI cable since you don't get one in the box.The next great thing is the LCD. It has 460,000 pixels and looks fantastic. It even brightens and dims automatically depending on the ambient light.If you know what you're doing you can use the good smattering of `manual' features to good effect. I'm not talking about changing the aperture or shutter speed, but you can adjust exposure compensation, bracketing, white balance, ISO etc. You can set auto ISO to not go higher than 400 or 800, which is useful since things look less than great above ISO400.If you can't be bothered with all that, set the mode dial to iA (intelligent auto) and leave everything to the camera. It works remarkably well, and you'll see the symbol change in the top corner of the LCD to tell you what scene it thinks you're taking. It even automatically goes into macro mode when set to iA.But I use mine mostly in standard mode, and I keep the ISO to 80 for the very best results.One of the best things about the TZ7 is the superb auto exposure system that gets the exposure spot on in an amazing variety of challenging situations that would completely fool my other cameras. Reliable auto-exposure, top-notch image stabilisation, really quick and accurate autofocus, a great LCD... these are the things that give you the confidence to pack the TZ7 as your only camera on a trip.There must be downsides though... mustn't there? Not many, to be honest, unless you expect the unreasonable, like good performance at ISO1600, or in very low light. The TZ7 doesn't overcome the laws of physics.But minor niggles for me are that there's a physical switch between record and playback mode, so unlike some cameras, you can't just half-press the shutter to get to record mode if you're in playback mode. Also, I'd prefer to have the metering options in the quick menu, which is otherwise very useful for changing settings.Actually, there is one other thing, and it's the battery. The TZ7 uses a battey with a Panasonic microchip in it. If you want a spare battery, and you probably will, since battery life is just average (HD video seems to sap battery life quite quickly), you'll have to buy a proper Panasonic one, and they're quite expensive. Third party batteries won't work, at least for now. I nearly knocked off the fifth star because of this.But the bottom line is that the TZ7 captures sharp, well-exposed images pretty much all the time with the minimum of fuss. I like mine very much indeed.", "Date": "May 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Customer Service / Warranty", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Customer\"", "ReviewID": "RN4XLH7O3D6RM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is really hard to rate this item, without discussing customer service / warranty issues as well.  For the first week the camera worked well, but after two usages the LCD screen became pixilated and the camera was sent to Panasonic for warranty repair.  The warranty department stated that NO EXTERNAL DAMAGE IS COVERED AT ALL.  Regardless of the fact that my camera was clearly brand new, and that this was obviously some defect in the camera or screen, Panasonic was unwilling to stand by their product.  Instead Panasonic stated \"We can replace your unit with a factory reconditioned unit.  This product, its operation and its appearance is like that of a new unit and it carries a 90 day warranty.\"  The cost would be an additional $135.50 for this reconditioned unit.  So basically I would pay $535.50 for a reconditioned camera with a 90 day warranty.  I have asked for my unrepaired, defective camera back and have been waiting for a week for the tracking number.

First of all, I am not a camera person.  I don't want to have to go to school to learn how to operate a camera.  I want a point and shoot that takes great pictures with only a push of the button from me.  I want a camera that forgives my shaky hands.  I want a camera that can figure out the best way to to take the picture without me going through a ton of menus trying to figure out what they mean--and missing the perfect shot.  AND, I want a camera I can throw in my purse and not really know it is there.I began my pursuit of the perfect camera in February of this year.  I started with a bias towards sony as I have always had a sony.  So, I purchased the top of the line sony point and shoot that wasn't a touch screen.  Let's just say, I was horribly, horribly, horribly disappointed and would rather have a 35 mm disposable than that camera.  Panasonic had great reviews and camera people that I spoke to spoke highly of it.  But at that time, the tz5 was out and not this.  I found out about this and waited and waited.  I was holding out for this camera over the tz5 because the zoom was greater and the video allowed you to zoom while you were taking it.  So, I can't compare this to the TZ5 in real life--just from what I read.I haven't had this camera very long so I can't give tons of detail.  But one thing that struck me was that I was able to take a beautiful picture of my family about 15 feet away when the lights were very dim in the room.  The sony couldn't even do that when the lights were bright in the room.  I didn't expect that of this camera--after all, it is just a point and shoot with a simple flash.  I was blown away.The other thing that I loved is that I took shot after shot, close up, far away, zoom, and macro.  I left the camera on the intelligent setting and it took each picture great.  I had one picture that was slightly blurry but i think it was my dogs fault because he was moving some.  Although it is quite possible that someone with better picture taking skills would have gotten a fine shot.I hooked the camera up to my mac via the included cable and effortlessly downloaded the pictures into iphoto.  I have not yet figured out the process for downloading video to the mac--although based on other reviews here, it can be done.  I am looking forward to being able to do that.  the video this camera took seemed superior to my camcorder (but it is about 5 years old).  More importantly, for me, is the fact that I don't have to miss video shots because i didn't lug my camcorder around.Another thing to note is that if you change the size of the MP, you can increase the optical zoom.  With 10MP it zooms 12X but with 3 MP (i think), it zooms 21 times.  Since I don't take pictures so that I can blow them up to poster size, reducing the MP isn't a problem for me.  And I can see great benefit to having 21X OPTICAL zoom.Over the last few months of searching for the perfect camera I have read many reviews, talked to many people and I certainly feel that I have made a wise decision.  I also think it is worth every penny--even if you have to pay full retail price.I did choose to get the extended warranty because with the TZ5 there were some reports of the shutter not always opening or the zoom breaking.  I never got the impression it was a large amount of cameras with the problem but I didn't want to risk it.  I haven't heard those same reports with the ZS3, but it is still very new so I wanted to be cautious.UPDATE:  after playing with the camera another day, we discovered the AF locking feature.  I don't know what that means and don't care to look in the manual--but what it does is astounding.  you push the button to lock in on the subject object you want to get a picture of.  the subject can be moving--i moved my head around in circles nonstop, rocked back and forth, etc.  and the picture took a clear picture of me--how did that happen?  I didn't stop moving.  Then we tried it while making the camera go in circles but the object stayed in place.  we also bounced the camera--again, clear pictures----WOW.  You could take great pictures while riding a bumpy train!  I didn't know about this feature when I bought the camera and I have to say that this is an awesome, exciting surprise!!  I can't wait to find out if there are any more!Also, I was able to turn off the sound through the menu and I don't notice the motor motor noise zooming in and out since then.  I also turned off the sound effect of it clicking when taking a picture.  Some people complained about the zooming sound and it was loud out of the box.  Instructions for turning off the noise is in the instruction booklet in an easy to understand way.After using this camera, I have discovered how much I was missing by not having a wide angle lens.  this is the widest angle lens  that I could find on point and shoot cameras.  I didn't realize how much of the shot I missed with just a regular lens until I compared it to this.This is such an awesome camera, I wish everyone could have one.", "Date": "May 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very strong performer", "Author": "Bay Area Techie", "ReviewID": "R1BBVK5UA6ZHNT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this recently for both work and non-work purposes, with the following observations:Pros:1) Outdoors, in daylight, amazingly good photos2) Excellent battery life3) Pretty user friendly4) Compact, easy to carry around in a coat pocket5) HD video from such a small camera is a major plus6) Zoom great for pictures of screen from distance, either standard outdoors photo or rear of conference hall7) Wide angle works very well8) fast focus, even in low light (see other low light comments below, however)Cons:1) Flash is good for about 5 to 8 feet, if you're expecting to see the same quality for indoor images as you will see for outdoor photography. If used beyond 10 feet or so, it will illuminate subjects, image on camera LCD will look GREAT, but image and subjects will look grainy on your computer due to high ISO setting (400, 800, etc) made by camera. While this graininess is to be expected at these settings, it is easy to be fooled by how good image looks on camera LCD right after photo is taken. Another reviewer commented earlier on these same issues with flash. Message to Panasonic: more power to flash in future versions. Message to user: indoor flash use will produce excellent, detailed photos if subject < 6 to 8 feet; ok photos that are acceptable, if somewhat grainy if beyond this.2) As others have mentioned, the dial on top right portion of camera that selects shooting mode is very loose, and will change settings on its own going into/coming out of your pocket. The camera is so good overall, that this is a minor nuisance, and one learns to check this as camera is turned on for use.3) Extra batteries, cables, are hard to come by. DO NOT buy spare batteries listed with product as accessories on Amazon or other web sites without checking battery # and ensuring a match: there are some listed on the ZC3's product page that do not work with this camera. Save yourself expense/hassle of return. Panasonic web site lists correct battery product number. (BCG10PP is correct battery number at the time of this writing).4) Need to remember to reset white balance. If you take photos indoors in NORMAL mode and set WB for indoor lighting, put camera away for the night, then turn camera on the next day, it will still be set for indoor lighting. Would be nice if there was an option to retain this setting/auto return to default when camera is turned off/on (the camera has this feature to retain current zoom level/reset to default setting when camera turned on/off)5) It is possible some casual users may find it a bit of a challenge to take advantage of all the pre-set exposure options, while some experienced users will find it frustrating that there is not more control.6) Found it difficult to get as good results with night shots as the camera seemed to over-ride my manual attempts to open shutter by 1 to 2 stops.7) Also with regard to night shots, low light photos, etc...  For taking pictures in low light setting, a few adjustments are needed to NORMAL mode. In low light, the camera will not use settings below ISO 200 (i.e. ISO 100, 80, etc..) unless you specify that. This accounts for part of the graininess of low light photos. This is partly necessary because the shutter speed \"default\" setting will not allow exposures beyond 1/8 second. So, if one wants to take higher quality picture in low light with longer shutter speed, both the ISO SENSITIVITY and the SHUTTER speed need to be manually adjusted in NORMAL mode (as best I can tell, to set ISO below 200, and use longer exposure [maximum exposure I found in NORMAL mode is 1 second]). While longer exposures are available in the pre-set modes (such as \"Starry sky\" mode), these are still somewhat grainy, I believe, due to high ISO setting used by camera. These are good precautions for casual photographer who is OK with modest quality low light photo, may have shaky hand, or does not use tripod, but an obstacle for more experienced user with a tripod, steady hand, etc...who want really high quality pictures. Perhaps I've missed something in instructions, but this is best I understand things at this time.Overall, I am very happy with the camera and glad I made the purchase.

I've owned 3 point-n-shoots in the last few years, because I am also a Mom and wanted something small to keep in my purse for the random moments when my DSLRs weren't around. Every one of those cameras drove me batty and proved a waste of my money. I decided to give the pocket camera One More Try when I read about the ZS3, especially with its inclusion of HD Video. I LOVE this camera! Love it!!On my family beach vacation, I only broke out the DSLR twice for some artistic shots of my kids. The ZS3 stayed in my beach bag the rest of the time, and I am thrilled with the shots it captured. The images are clear, crisp, with beautiful color and detail. The exposures have been excellent. The 12X zoom is a great reach, and the shots are still clear zoomed in. The shutter lag on this camera is better than any PNS I've ever used. It's no SLR, but it's darn good for what it is! The burst mode also works great for stopping the action. And the HD video is just as great. I don't know that I'll bother picking up my camcorder again now that I have this.My only two minor negatives: the video record button is in an awkward spot, and I've accidentally hit it a few times just holding the camera. But it's not bothersome enough that it would affect my 5-star rating for the camera. Negative #2 is the ACVHD Lite video/software which is not Mac compatible. All of my computers are Mac, so this hiccup is disappointing, but again not bothersome enough to alter my opinion of the camera. I just shoot regular HD video instead and the problem is solved for me. Ok, so maybe I'd give this camera 4.5 stars if I could, but 4 stars would be too low so I stuck with 5.I never imagined I could like, much less LOVE, a point and shoot camera like I do this one.

Now you can actually HAVE the best camera WITH YOU all the time!***Here is why THIS camera is better than the other HD point and shoot camera-recorders  available:1) TWICE the resolution on the LCD screen than virtually EVERY OTHER CAMERA of its kind...super bright.2) DOLBY STEREO MIKE (and you can TELL it's stereo during playback....cool!)3) CAN SWITCH BETWEEN HD MODES! IF YOU NEED IT...AVCHD Capability is available which uses about 30% less memory than the MPEG 4 QT HD (though included software is awful for editing, and not much is available except maybe roxio or other expensive AVCHD editing programs)..USE the MPEG 4 QT HD recording method available in the camera4)..That 12X otical is at the full 10 megapixels...it goes to 24X OPTICAL with slightly lower resolutions, but still excellent quality and over 40X zoom with digitital zoom (limited to 12X optical on the full AI mode)5) Motor sound on zooming is almost nonexistent (unlike the Sony...you need only watch a few YOUTUBE videos of the cameras you like to hear the zoom motors)Aside from the obvious (12X OPTICAL+ zoom), the small size (in a pocket) and the decent battery life (buy extra battery if traveling), the HDMI mini cord for direct to TV,(buy one on ebay for about $6)the Panasonic  ZS3 is just plain COOL!You will LOVE the simple pre-set modes, and there are PLENTY of adjustments on the modes for everyone but the most professional photographer. The loose dial that some people complain about is NOT really loose, just easy to switch...smooth.OK, heres the deal on HD video....USE the standard HD format (Quicktime) INSTEAD of the AVCHD format for now.WHY?(1)The QT (MPEG4 HD) uses a bit more memory than the AVCHD option, but AVCHD software STINKS right now except for a few.(2) The savings in memory space using the new AVCHD lite method WOULD have been more useful 6 months ago, but now you can get 16 and 32 gig cards, so use the QT standard HD format because it is WAY MORE UNIVERSAL and the quality is EXACTLY THE SAME...I TESTED IT.(3) You can more easily edit and burn (and people can play easier) the MPEG4 Quicktime HD format.(4) The MPEG4 format is easier to find on your drive and fits into the file storage method you are likely using now. If you try to find the AVCHD file you made...good luck. Its auto named VERY FUNKY and wierd.DONT USE THE INCLUDED SOFTWARE...IT SUCKS...BIG TIME. Use whatever photo editing software you like EXCEPT the included software. So, again, when you store the HD as a QT (MPEG4) format, it fits in with everything you are used to doing, buit now you get HD in STEREO!WOW!AGAIN, SAVE USE of the AVCHD for the future IF you ever will really need it. Basically, I look at it this way...the AVCHD is cool, but the need for it is ALREADY obsolete with large hard discs and large storage capacity on SD cards nowadays. Besides, you WANT to share these videos anyway, and most of them are only about, what?...10-60 seconds long anyway? Filming a graduation ceremony or a play...FINE, THEN use the AVCHD...it's an easy switch IF you have to use it.FINALLY, USE YOUTUBE VIDEOS to see how any camera you are interested in works. I also found that using Firefox browser is better to avoid the youtube choppiness that happens when you aometimes view HD on internet explorer on youtube.Hope this info helps.NEW COMMENT UPDATED 06-27-09: Constant Clicking In Viodeos..SOLUTIONIn many of my videos, I heard a constant clicking. This is the continuous auto focus which you do NOT need for 99.9% of your videos. Simply disable the continuous auto focus in the video mode. You go to the main settings menu using the center button (when in camera mode), and on the left is a video camera icon. Choose that, then go to the page where it says CAF and disable it. This will take care of the constant clicking.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "CodeChaser", "ReviewID": "R2TG5SF6EZEFO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content":

In multiple reviews everyone complained about the battery life. In summary the camera is fantastic, and the battery life is not an issue for me.  Here is an example of a real life usage.Using a fully charged battery, which had been sitting in the camera for a couple weeks. I took my daughter to a pop concert, Miley Cyrus, with a 2 gig SD card.  I was able to shoot 10 videos of different length as was over 100 pictures.  Since this was my first time to push the camera's limits, I was doing alot of zooming, digital zooming, checking this, and that. Of course the digital zooming required me to be real steady, for a long time, while I waite for a good shot. So for a little less than 3 hours I never shut the camera off, zoomed constantly, and shot a lot of pictures, as well as reviewed, deleted shots/videos I did not need.The videos & pictures came out fantastic even when I went into digital zoom, since the seats we had were just below the nose bleed section at the opposite end of the 20,000+ concert. The next day when I turned the camera I got the battery low alert and the camera turned off, so I recharged it, etc.. From what I read, using all rechargable batties, waiting until you get a low battery message will assist in maintaining a proper charge amount.I transferred the Videos to the mpg format and took them to work.  The people in the office were in shock at the quality, the distance, since I would zoom back to the actual seat point of view, as compared to the size of the camera.  There were very impressed by the camera, and no one cared including myself that the battery only lasted for this concert.The ability to put an 720P HD video camera, with 12x optical, and a clear 40x digital in your pocket worth the cost of buying a second battery.  I attached a video to this review using a MPEG-2 format, .mpg, if you are running WinXP or Vista yo may need to fix the sound on your system, otherwise in Win7 it runs perfectly.  This video demonstrates the video as well as the sound quality for this little pocket camera.", "Date": "December 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "The amazing Panasonic Lumix ZS3!", "Author": "Douglas R.

amazing point and shoot -- probably the best you can get", "Author": "RonAnnArbor", "ReviewID": "R3UOLUOUY3YRWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I want to preface this by saying I mostly shoot with a professional dSLR, so to me, Image Quality is the most important aspect of photography -- but I will be the first to say that there are times that I would never lug around a dSLR -- to an amusement park, a family picnic, a night out with friends, a weekend at the beach, a walk with the dog...I had been using a Canon G9 as my backup camera for point-and-shoot situations, but over the last couple years I have had many situations where it has been just too heavy and as cumbersome as bringing along my dSLR...I looked at the G10, which was even heavier and even bigger!. Hm....Having played around with several top of the line compact point-and-shoots, and having even bought a few of them and returned them, there was nothing that I deemed high Image Quality until I read all the reviews on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 coming out of Europe and Asia (who had it before we did under a different name)...I couldn't want to try it - and BOY was the wait worth it.This camera produces far and away the best Image Quality I have ever seen on a small point-and-shoot that is lightweight, small, and has an amazing 12x zoom. It's 1/2 the size of the Canon G10. But the real test came when I took the camera to a weekend at Cedar Point and got daytime as well as nighttime shots that were simply stunning. While you can't really set any of the manual settings, there are plenty of shooting modes, but right out of the box, the camera has the \"smarts\" to just take great photos - auto setting the ISO, auto setting the shutter and aperture settings as needed, and just having a \"knack\" to produce sharp and brilliant jpg photos (there is no Raw setting for those who want it -- I don't so I am perfectly happy). Photos of neon lit roller coasters and LED light strewn trees at night just looked amazing, all hand-held, all just a snap. Putzing a bit with the scene modes gives you a little bit of creativity with flash -- but it's hardly necessary.This camera now stays in my work messenger bag 24/7 for photos on the fly. It simply has stunning IQ, photos are sharp and well exposed, and I can not recommend it more.Re-reading this starts to sound like an advertisement for the camera! You can read through my reviews and see that I primarily shoot only with Nikon equipment, occasional Canon equipment. This Panasonic camera is just a total surprise. It shouldn't be - since people have been touting how great Panasonic's point and shoots have been for years to me, but seeing is believing.I wish I could give it 6 stars. Nothing else compares. One word of warning: the camera is massively underproduced so it is out of stock most places -- look around and you should be able to find it - don't pay the over-inflated prices that some people are gauging because they know how popular this camera now is, and are asking 4 - 5x the asking price. The list price is 399.99 -- anything over that is price gauging.I got mine through pre-order, and paid about 349.00 for it through a reputable dealer.", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "ZS3 VS TZ5 vs ZS1", "Author": "Hassan B. Bn Hadhram", "ReviewID": "RKOBONCVBETF1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll compare ZS3 with TZ5 in this review if you want full review about ZS3 read other reviews, I wanted to buy new camera and TZ5 was already available for 210$ and ZS3 sold out and costs 399$, since ZS3 is an upgraded TZ5 from last year i was thinking if its worth the wait and the extra 200$~ to get the ZS3 (Been trying to get it for weeks but couldn't find it anywhere)Anyway here we goZS3 got everything that TZ5 have with extra stuff which is* ZS3 is slimmer/smaller/lighter and the battery is a little bit better* ZS3 got brighter screen (Good when you shoot during sunlight)* ZS3 record HD 1280X720p in AVCHD high quality 17mpbs format* Better placed microphone,in the TZ5 your hands end up on the microphone* ZS3 record in High Quality Stereo,TZ5 record in low quality mono sound* better cleaner picture and less noise thanks to the newer Sensor/tech* ZS3 got Extra 2x Zoom and better 25mm wide angle instead of 28mm* New Auto mode is so smart even the inexperienced gets good pictures* Faster and stronger auto focus with face Recognition and Face Detection* Dedicated recording button for videos (Take videos during photo mode)* 10MP without any quality loss thanks to the newer sensor* HDMI Output that can be used for both videos and picturesIn the other hand ZS3 VS ZS1 (ZS1 is cheaper by 100-150$ right now)* ZS1 lacks the HDMI output that can be found in the ZS3* ZS1 Can not record in HD at all and AVCHD format not available* ZS1 record in low quality mono sound* ZS1 got no dedicated button for fast access to video recording* ZS1 LCD is smaller (2.7 vs ZS3 3.0) and less resolution* ZS1 got 1/2.5 CCD vs 1/2.33 CCD on the ZS3 (ZS3 a little better)* ZS1 Image stabilization is not great during video capture unlike ZS3* ZS1 Does not have the wind noise reduction option unlike the ZS3So after my research i decided that i want the ZS3 and it was worth it because i care a lot about high quality HD videos with High quality Stereo sound so it was no brainier to me specially the fact its smaller even when they added more zoom and extra wide angle lens with more MP and less noiseI hope this was helpful", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "A $3,500 lens - For Under $400", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R1QQ7QZD6AHHHX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Leica is famous for the quality of their lens designs. A 24mm super-wide angle lens provides a much greater field of view than the more common 35mm wide angle lens. A 24mm ultra-wide lens makes it possible to take interior photos that show a large portion of a room, or to take architectural photos of entire buildings, even in tightly packed urban areas.The problem is that Leica's famous 24mm super-wide angle lens costs about $3,500. But, now Leica has designed a 25mm to 300mm zoom lens for the Panasonic ZS1 and ZS3 which has even LESS visible distortion (bowing of straight lines, such as doors and window frames) and vignetting (darkening of the photo's corners) than does Leica's famous 24mm lens.The Panasonic DMC-ZS1 and DMC-ZS3 share a superb Leica-designed zoom that provides outstanding performance from the super-wide 25mm range, through to the 50mm \"normal\" range waaay up to very long telephoto zoom of 300mm...and the lens provides excellent color and contrast in every part of that very long range.There are NO zoom lenses or digital cameras available at ANY price level that will outperform the Panasonic ZS series for ultra-low distortion, rich colors and excellent contrast throughout the entire ultra-wide to long telephoto range of the ZS cameras.The Panasonic ZS series cameras are designed to be easy to use. Putting them in the \"intelligent auto\" mode enables the camera to make all of the decisions. You simply zoom in on your subject, press the shutter very slightly to pre-focus, wait a second to see the focus confirmation \"dot\", then press the shutter to take your photo.The camera will automatically switch to the \"macro\" mode if you are taking a photo of something a few inches from your lens, it will recognize a person's face and switch to the \"portrait\" mode for natural skin tones, and it re-adjusts the ISO level and shutter speed to match the lighting conditions for each photo.Outdoors, the \"intelligent auto\" mode delivers consistently fine photos with natural color tones and contrast. The photos are \"sharp\" due to Panasonic's auto stabilization mode, which makes it possible to get hand-held photos that are tack sharp, even at the full telephoto range of 300mm.WARNING:  Flash photos tend to be mediocre unless you are careful.  The \"intelligent auto\" mode is most effective in with subjects that are very close...about three feet to six feet from the camera. Beyond six feet, many flash photos are darker than most people would prefer. The solution is to switch to the manual mode, and select a higher ISO of 200 or 400. The flash results are best in a well lighted room. However, the tiny flash, and a mediocre indoor \"white balance\" results in flash photos that are too dark, and with skin tones that are \"off\".  As a indoor flash camera, the Panasonic is average...or even less than average.Panasonic provides many \"scene\" options, including a \"night mode\" that takes beautiful time exposures in dim lighting. I took some \"night mode\" shots in a dark coffee shop without flash that perfectly recreate the mood of the dimly lighted room. Also, in the manual mode, users can set the maximum ISO they want to use, and set the minimum shutter speed they prefer. So, for a sports photo, you can chose to use ONLY shutter speeds of 1/250 of a second or faster to \"freeze\" the action. Or, you can switch to the \"sports\" mode, and the camera will select a fast shutter speed, and lock the focus to keep subjects beyond about 16 feet away in sharp focus.The manual options give users dozens of ways to tailor their photos, including ways of fine-tuning the color balance. The instruction book uses 140 pages to detail all of the options for every type of photo. It is worth an owner's time to work page by page through the entire 140 pages to learn everything this camera can do.But, MOST people will be happy to simply put the camera in \"intelligent auto\" mode and let the camera make all of the decisions. With just a hour or two of practice, anyone should be able to obtain fine photos consistently.Digital \"noise\" is always an issue with pocket sized compact digital cameras. However, with the ZS cameras the digital \"noise\" is well controlled. In an 8 x 10 inch enlargement, it would take a very keen eye to see any \"noise\" in the ISO 80 to ISO 200 range. At ISO 400, a small amount of noise be visible in an enlargement, but only if you are looking for it.For people who are \"fanatics\" about reducing digital \"noise\", the ZS enables you to select an \"auto\" mode that \"locks\" the ISO to the 80 ISO to 400 ISO range, or you can \"lock\" the ISO at 80, 100, or 200 for low \"noise\" photos.  In bright sunlight, locking exposure at ISO 80 results in photos that can match up well with those from $3,000 pro DSLR cameras.The battery will last about 300 photos without using the flash, depending on how much time you spend reviewing and editing them, and about 200 photos if you use the flash for half your photos.  The battery gauge tell you how much power is remaining with three segments followed by a flashing red warning.  The battery charges in two hours or less.WARNING:  The size and shape of the LS cameras make them VERY easy cameras to drop. It would be wise to ALWAYS wrap the strap around your wrist BEFORE you pull the camera out of its case. The LS will fit into a jacket pocket, but it would be better protected in a case.  Cameras this nice, with such an astounding zoom lens deserve being treated with care, and a padded case is an inexpensive way to protect your investment.", "Date": "August 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Easy to use digital Camera with great HD video!~But CAUTION when order replacement batteries!", "Author": "Linda", "ReviewID": "R12RALEP6XFQNC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera just before I left for a trip to the Galapagos Islands. I'm not a whiz kid when it comes to cameras, but I knew the Galapagos Islands would have once-in-a-life-time photo opportunities that I didn't want to miss due to poor quality equipment or equipment that was too complicated for me to use. This camera DELIVERED on all my needs! (except battery incompatibilities, mentioned later!)I recommend spending an hour or two with the camera and instruction book. The 130 page instruction book was easy to navigate through, but it takes a while to familiarize yourself with everything this amazing little camera is capable of doing!!The quality of my vacation photos and videos were amazing! I was able to record a video of the mating dance of two blue-footed boobies, iguanas fighting, and sea lions and penguins playing.  My landscape photos have such detail that it's hard to believe these were not taken with a more expensive SLR digital.  When I returned home, I projected the video onto a giant classroom screen during a lecture and the quality was amazing. Everyone asked what type of camera I was using! I connected the camera to my Samsung 46 inch 1080i HDTV. The photos and videos looked so good I couldn't believe they were really MY photos!The large 3 inch LCD monitor on the SZ3 is large enough to review photos and videos so I could easily determine which photos and videos were worth keeping while I was still on vacation. The size and quality of the LCD was even good enough replay videos and scan through photos for fellow travelers.The 12X optical zoom on this camera allowed me to zoom up on animals and landmarks otherwise too far away to photograph. I did not try out the 21X extended optical zoom. Thanks to the setting made for photos from airplane windows, my on-flight photos turned out better than any on-flight photos I've ever seen.There is a setting on the camera that allows you to hold the shutter down. It will continue to take photos until you release the shutter. This allowed me to take photos of animals in motion and later choose to save which photo caught the animal in that \"ideal\" position! No more pushing the shutter only to have the subject move and you've missed the shot! If you don't want to change settings on the camera, there is an \"Intelligent Auto Mode\" that adjusts automatically to light, movement, scenery (adjusts to take sharp pictures near and far landscapes), recognizes faces to adjust light to create optimal settings for portrait lighting, etc.The FACE RECOGNITION setting isn't always accurate. I tried to train it to recognize my dad, and several other faces were later incorrectly identified by my camera as \"Dad.\" Hopefully re-training it will resolve that glitch. I eventually had to turn off. It was even labeling photos of women as \"Dad\"!The Travel feature allows you to set the dates of your vacation into the camera memory. It also allows you to change the time zone during your vacation and automatically returns to \"home\" clock at the end of the 'Vacation mode dates'. This creates a time stamp that is not only accurate to your vacation time zone, but allows you to record when & WHERE each photo was taken! This is especially great if your travels include several cities or islands. The on-screen menu tells you what day of your trip you are on (Galapagos Day 1, Galapagos Day 2, etc.). It's really nice for later when you are trying to sort through photos and remember what day and where they were taken. Especially when you have more than one SD card!You can increase the size of the on screen menu to a larger font if you have problems with reading small print.I have to say I was impressed with the different settings for taking photos of babies, sunsets, portraits, food, etc. It was amazing how many differnt settings were available and the instruction book gives great hints on how to maximize the use of each of those settings. I think this is one of the best instruction manuals I've seen for cameras.Again, my only hesitation with this camera is with the battery, and it's more of an idealogical complaint against Panasonic. I just don't think they should create a camera with a battery that is so difficult to find and doesn't have a compatable generic. SO.........WARNING!!!!!!!!! THE ONLY battery that is compatable with this camera is the Panasonic Lumix DMW-BCG10PP. USE CAUTION when ordering batteries advertized on Amazon's website that claim to be compatible with this camera. I ended up going on vacation without a second battery and due to the high volume of photos and videos I was taking each day I ran out of battery before the end of the day. Luckily most days I had a lunch period where I was able to recharge the battery. The instructions say you can get 300 photos from a battery charge, but I got more than twice that amount and somedays got almost three times that many. Still, If I didn't recharge mid-day, I ran out of battery before I ran out of photo opportunities each day. I'm sure it's because I took those shots so close together. One battery is probably good enough for almost every situation except special vacations where photos are a huge part of your day! ENJOY!", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great for photos, mediocre for movies at lower settings", "Author": "Matt Eye \"Matthew\"", "ReviewID": "R2QLKKUKWEXIYI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update 2010/1/3: Bought the Panasonic DMC-FZ35 a few days ago. Will write my review on that camera eventually. As always, thanks for your comments!Update 2009/11/17: I am noting this at the top of the review to make something clear. A few days ago, I dropped my ZS3 on the concrete (while photographing construction site) about five feet up and it doesn't power on anymore. Now I am looking for a new camera in the meantime. Having said that, if you can't power it on, you can't get the data off the SD or SDHC card, right? If you have a photo printer, for instance, that can read SDHC cards, just put the card in and you can get the data off the card pronto! Transfer may be a bit slow. Hope this helps in case you think you may be stuck for a while... Now on to my original review (May 2009)...This review is long, but will be useful to the more tech-savvy (I guess as the saying goes, \"Buyer beware\")... (Notice I rated this camera 4/5 stars--after all, it is 'primarily' a high-MP camera, not a HD camcorder, although some HD camcorders probably aren't better than the Panasonic DMC-ZS3.)The Panasonic DMC-ZS3 could literally serve as a paperweight and what it is intended for (unless it stops working by popular terminology). It feels solid and heavy (made of metal), but lest its screen can easily be scratched (does fingerprint easily), and if dropped, may be damaged. This camera has a wrist strap, no neck strap like some cameras have. Buy a camera case such as Lowepro--inexpensive and durable, e.g. if you would rather carry it securely looped through your belt.I bring up a few other cameras in this review (either have them or have compared their features/reviews on other sites).Start with memory cards--you can't use MultiMedia for movies, just photos. Standard SD cards work in this camera but will take several seconds to write photos or movies. You can't record but the lowest MJPEG movie res on internal memory. High-speed SD cards can't be read on older and some newer card readers (surprised the local Best Buy did not carry high-speed card readers). You can always copy directly from the camera via USB cable. :-| You don't need the software CD to read on Mac and PC, unlike some cameras that need the drivers from it for Plug-in-Play (at least on XP and Tiger). :-)Received this new Panasonic camera yesterday (May 11). The small included battery out-of-the-box had enough power to change settings and try it out before the full charge (about two hours) for its firmware update.I'd not recommend updating the firmware unless you enjoy updating anything (some people can't stand updating, but it's my favorite thing aside from productivity on a computer). If you don't feel comfortable updating the firmware, heed your instinct. I went ahead and updated the firmware without a problem (read the instructions several times, easier than it looks), but it did not change the behavior of the AVCHD readability, and the 'noise' during zoom while recording movies was as noticeable--updater beware!Zooming is noisy and somewhat fast taking photos, but very slow recording movies. Most, if not all compact cameras zoom slower than larger cameras would to compensate for size--it is common sense!Taking pictures and motion pictures is a breeze, and best of all, as in my old Panasonic camcorder (which is much too intolerant in cold and humid environments, causing the tape not to play/record properly, and nearly damaged the unit), the camera will tell you which mode you have changed, if using internal memory, and if the card is full (but all cameras do that to my knowledge). It reads three bars on its battery level meter, unlike some cameras like the Canon PowerShot S1 IS with only a blinking low battery icon.Disclaimer the following explanations: I am basing the following on my experience only. I'd not bother to enable sound recording (warning--don't confuse with the Canon PowerShot that creates a separate WAV file) while taking photos. It takes the photo then creates a still video file from whatever setting the camera's movie recording happens to be set to, and will record the few seconds. In other words, it uses the picture you shot and turns it into a video file that plays back still with the audio. It takes up little disk space and clutters the media card. Not too annoying for me, but don't expect individual voice memos with the DMC-ZS3. The default setting is off anyway. Memo-taker beware!To find the AVCHD Lite files quickly, memorize where to go (there may be more folders/files on the card than on the internal media): LUMIX (ROOT) > PRIVATE > AVCHD > BDMV > STREAM > #####.MTS (MTS the file extension of the AVCHD Lite file). The following may be helpful for Mac users...If you have Roxio Toast (probably version 9 or later recommended) installed, double-click on the AVCHD file, choose to open with Roxio (or Roxio Toast) Video Player, and it will then play for you. It won't show the time (at least by default settings).Another but free option is VLC you can download (its icon the white & orange striped cone). Its interface is like simplified iTunes. To associate the AVCHD Lite (MTS extension) in the future so that VLC will always play (show terminal-like icon with 'exec' in small print on the icon - Toast Video Player won't change the white generic icon, usually files not associated with any known program on the OS). Select the file, Get Info, choose Other to select which application to open with, choose application (navigate to where VLC located and will be unavailable - to make it available, drop-down where it reads Recommended Applications and choose All Applications). Select VLC program (with the cone icon), choose, and then make default and confirm (changing to the terminal exec icon). Double-click on the file and enjoy watching AVCHD Lite!Low-quality AVCHD Lite is very good quality and will save substantial memory card space, but not suitable for zooming and fast motion, as the colors and compression artifacts appear patchy, making the video look cruddy. I have not tried the high-quality setting, but for fast motion or zooming (very slow, and it does not matter how slow--you can still hear the motor--this is not a professional $25,000 camera for the big screen, so you get what you pay for). Use MJPEG for smooth playback and compatibility with most software, but use the HD quality setting. Actually, the VGA and QVGA modes look very pixilated compared to other cameras in the league of Canon PowerShot S series--my old 2004 S1 IS takes better VGA movies and much smoother than this new Panasonic (especially the 320 X 240 on the PowerShot is somewhat better). :-( In addition, the Canon's movie mode is better (at saving disk space) because you can choose 15 or 30 fps for 320 X 240 and 640 X 480/Fine, unlike this Panasonic 30 fps (well, it is the standard anyway). Overall movie recording feature on the DMC-ZS3 = 4/5 for stereo recording and HD, but substandard quality on VGA settings to Canon PowerShot S series and possibly the new Samsung HZ10W or HZ15W models. On the other hand, of all the cameras mentioned, this Panasonic has the best photo quality IMO--maybe better than some entry-level SLRs!The picture quality on this Panasonic given 5/5, better than most cameras in its price range (checked Google Image Search and YouTube for samples). Even some SLR cameras don't take quite as clear photos. JPEG compression is quite low on the DMC-ZS3, but probably due to the high MP for its small lens, graininess appears in low lighting on any ISO setting, but subtle, and even ISO 1600 is not bad in well-lit outdoor environments. Indoors, yes, color artifacts and noise are apparent, but probably just good enough for printing at ISO 800. ISO 1600 might be decent for printing on bright, sunny days, i.e. if you want a perfect shot of a water sprinkler in action. Let the automatic 'intelligent' setting(s) do the rest. I have not done extensive testing yet (duh, have had it one day now), but believed to work very well. Sometimes I had to set the flash not/to fire manually, a minor annoyance.If minor grain/noise in any ISO setting for pictures, very low JPEG compression artifacts (no RAW support), any random photo in moderate to ambient lighting is almost free from blur, and to expect decent movie recordings in HD only, this camera is for you. If you want any movie recording to look decent at any resolution/quality setting but can do with more grain, noise, and some blurry photos, Canon or Samsung might be your ticket. Do keep in mind that the settings and environment will yield results for better or for worse. (In fact, I ordered the Samsung HZ15W at first sight, but then canceled as it was not yet available, and felt the reviews on the DMC-ZS3 were better received. Happy with my alternated decision! Who knows, the HZ10W/HZ15W may be just as capable--you can pause and resume movies without starting a new movie file, you can't do on the Panasonic and any camera as of current, but I am not sure if MJPEG is available on the HZ15W.)Keep in mind that neither the Canon PowerShot S1 IS nor the Panasonic DMC-ZS3 focus well in low lighting in movie mode, but does fine for photos in my experience.Battery life is very good, but if you are planning on recording at a ball game or an amusement park, consider purchasing a spare battery (expensive but any proprietary battery of such will be), a couple of 16 GB or 32 GB memory cards, record in HD, and transfer to PC via high-speed card reader or the camera (with sufficient battery life) for best performance. (Just one hour of HD video may be enough to fill a Dual Layer recordable DVD.)Despite its minor shortcomings, this camera is one of the best in its class. Very well worth the wait (at least a week for free shipping in my case). Happy Panasonicking, Samsunging, or Canoning!Hope this helps other reviewers and others who have this model or ready to purchase one. Most say this camera competes with the Canon PowerShot SX200 IS, but IMO its closest competitor (because of optical zooming unlike the Canon) is the Samsung HZ15W (HZ10W its predecessor).P.S.

Two thirds of the photos made with the sony were out of focus. Also the standard default 50mm angle of view is just plain boring. So after looking around for one with ultra wide angle capability I selected the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3.The wide angle capability (25mm) is spectacular. It opens a a whole new perspective on the point and shoot camera. The images just have a spacious quality to them that really grabs your attention. And the wide angle allows for and extra creative element to your photos. The LCD is very high quality. It's a generous 3 inches and is absolutely outstanding in it's color and clarity. The camera is small and compact but has a very solid and quality feel to it. Seems to be all metal with exception of the battery/SD chip cover.The photos I have taken so far have turned out excellent,super clear and sharp.", "Date": "April 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "The ideal camera for the picky photographer - or married to one.", "Author": "Bore Duo \"nano cow\"", "ReviewID": "RCM4ID3GIZOZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My family and I own five other cameras - all Canons, from their little Elph to a high-end DSLR. My wife thought I had changed religions when she saw the Panasonic/Leica Lumix. I take a LOT of pictures. I have a color-calibrated monitor and printers and a 5000\u00b0K (color) room, with special paint, lights and carpet. In other words, I am PICKY!I wanted a camera I could take everywhere, and use everywhere. That meant that PORTABILITY was my number one criteria for this purchase. The camera HAD to fit in shirt pocket or pants pocket. Than means that the lens had to retract with a cover, like it does on the Lumix. That said, the question was, \"How good of a camera can you get in that small package?\"The answer is, \"UNBELIVABLE.\" The most important thing for any photographer in a camera is the optics (\"glass,\" we call it). The Leica lens has to be the most sophisticated lens in a camera this size. Although the motorized lens folds flat into the body, it has 10 elements (pieces of glass in the lens), including three aspheric surfaces and two made out of extra-low dispersion (ED) glass.  A couple of years ago a single piece of aspheric glass in a lens meant that lens would sell for $800 or more. In other words, Leica used amazing new technology inside this lens, which is why the pictures look so amazing. I can't say enough positive about the picture quality from this small camera.For most people, the most important thing in a point-and-shoot camera like this is USABILITY. What that means is getting the pictures you want with the least amount of fuddling around. It is one thing to read a list of 50 features before you buy; it is quite another thing to hunt through dozens of tiny, cryptic menus to figure out how to turn off the flash, or whatever.It is in creating a new standard of USABILITY that I think Leica/Panasonic deserves an award. The buttons are easy to get to and despite their size, they have confident feel with a real click. And they are LABELED! The on/off switch says, \"ON  OFF.\" There is a dedicated flash button and a dedicated delete button (with a high contrast picture of garbage can next to it). There is a dedicated movie button, although I won't be taking any videos with this camera.The menus are in ENGLISH. (Can whoever decide that reverting to Egyptian icons from written language be taken out and cut into 10.1 million pieces, please!) The menus use color intelligently, and are in type on the 3\" LCD screen large enough for people to read without putting on reading glasses. The most important features are the fastest to get to. Somebody talked to real photographers in designing the user interface.There are too many well-thought-out usability features to list here. For example, the top knob has two programmable positions where you can store your favorite settings. I love that!For me, the feature that triggered my purchase decision was the ability to record five or ten seconds of audio annotation with each photograph. If you are at a party, you can speak the name of the person after you take the shot. If you are on a trip, you can name the location. This, for me, is HUGE!I have to talk about the zoom lens. Obviously, 12X optical zoom is unusual. Most photographers don't like zoom lenses because the sacrifice in image quality is too great. However, the optical quality out of this camera is AMAZING. The wide-angle setting is unusually wide. I have used it liberally. The word is, FUN. You can shoot in a crowded room full of people and get every single person. You can shoot a big scenic and get all the mountains, lake, sunset--everything. You can shoot a puppy's nose from three inches away. All wide-angle lenses suffer from a problem known as chromatic aberration, which means that at the corners of the picture you get green and purple fringe around objects. This lens does not do that. I don't know what magic they used.Panasonic includes an optical image stabilizer. I have used this feature in the past on my high-end DSLR, and it is magic. However, until this camera, I had never seen it work well on a small camera. I have taken some ultra-zoom pictures that came out 100% sharp. I haven't done enough testing to know the limits of stabilizer, but under average conditions the results are AMAZING.There is macro capability, which means the lens can focus as close as few inches. I took a photo of a bumble-bee.Battery-life. We went on a three-hour hike. I had the camera on nearly all the time, with the display on, and the flash forced on, and the lens in auto-focus. One hundred photos later, the battery showed two-thirds left. Your mileage may vary, but I think that kind of battery life is amazing. And yes, I always carry a spare, charged battery with me.The camera does not come with accessories. Plan on buying: a soft case, an HD-SC memory card (the faster the better - look for a minimum speed of \"6\"), and an extra battery. The camera has a tiny amount of internal memory - I could take about nine photos with NO memory card installed. So I could play with the camera while I waited for my later purchase to arrive. Thank you, Panasonic.I should name some negatives. There is one big one and one small one. The big one is that the LCD is not visible in sunlight. Nobody has an LCD that fixes this problem, yet. But I wish they did. There is no viewfinder, so for outdoor photography you are pretty much blind. I know you can buy sun-shades, but you shouldn't have to buy some after-market, glue-on band-aid to this problem. And, you need more than a sunshade to see the screen in daylight.The small problem is that there is no \"raw\" mode. Us picky types like to adjust contrast and color in post-production software. A camera like this goes to a lot of trouble to give you an acceptable picture with no tweaking. The camera does a good job, but I like my sky blue, not white. I have found a work-around, but what I really want is, \"raw.\"The user manual is printed paper and well written. Very well written. My biggest complaint is that nobody makes a small case for this camera with a dedicated compartment for the user manual.I almost gave this camera a rating of 3 stars, just so people would read my review. But that wouldn't have been fair. You have to buy the products you respect so the manufactures build more good products like this wondrous camera, instead of the discount drek you see everywhere.Thank you for reading.

Amazing pics, especially in low light (where so many digitals fail). Can't go wrong with Leica lens. Lighting-fast start up. Shutter lag??? What shutter lag???

Intuative controls - pretty much no reason to read the manual.

I have owned a variety of digital Nikon, Olympus, Canon, as well as sampling friends' digital cameras. I had gotten to the point where I expected never to be impressed by a digital camera - as convenient as they are, they just don't render images with the detail that film does. I am now admitting I was wrong - this camera renders images so true in color and resolution, I would have thought I took them with my Leica.I have been reading some of the negative reviews about grainy indoor shots and poor low-light shots. I think I have an idea why some users have experienced this. No pics are going to look good or be free of grain or noise above 400 ISO. DO NOT USE IA (intelligent auto) feature - in low light it will automatically use higher ISO and you will end up with grainy, noisy pics. Instead, use normal mode and go to menu - intelligent ISO and select ISO 400 max. I just tried both modes side by side - with IA and flash off in a semi-dark room, the ISO was 1250. Using Normal mode and ISO 400 max, the aperature and shutter speed adjusted and the resulting pic was much sharper - incredible difference. User error will get you every time!A bit more expensive than your average digital camera, but so worth it. If you are looking for a simple camera for pics of kids and vacations, you can spend less, but you will not find better image quality. If you are a frustrated digital user who can't understand why a digital can't seem to take a decent picture in extreme conditions (low-light, for example), or want digital images that rival film images - you have found your nirvana.I would wager that this compact camera stacks up to the digital SLRs costing many hundreds more.", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "It's David to Canon & Nikon's DSLR Goliaths", "Author": "random bob, a.r.c.", "ReviewID": "R3TTD30AEIY1EI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have finally settled on a camera. I have tried many, from the higher echelons (Canon DSLRs) to the low-end (Canon SD1000), trying to alternately to get the most photo pizazz and then to just get the most enjoyment out of them as fast & painlessly as possible. It always seemed that it was one or the other: have a camera that could take good pictures with a long lens but put up with the hassle of transporting it and operating it, or have an easily-pocketable camera that will not be up to par in a lot of situations and thusly miss a lot of potential shots.Then my significant other stumbled upon these Panasonic Travel Zooms. I was apprehensive at first, so I let her be the guinea pig. After she received hers I took it away and played with it myself. I was impressed enough that although I had recently gotten a new DSLR (again) to replace a broken low-end Pocket Camera (SD1000) that I bought because I was initially tired of lugging around a large DSLR that I never took out of the bag in the first place, I decided to SELL the new DSLR and get one of the Panny's for myself.The largest lens you're getting for a DSLR is going to be in the 300mm range. To get much longer a reach you have to deal with an enormous lens that you probably can't afford and is too bulky to be with you at all times. With the Panasonic, I get the same focal range at the long-end -- 300mm -- and can skinny down to 25mm at the short end.The images are very good -- not as good as a good DSLR shot, missing some clarity at 100% magnification -- but for the needs of the masses they are far more than adequate in quality. The colors are realistic & warm. The videos are sharp and clear as long as you're not trying to focus on heavily backlit subjects, as the camera will choke on the dust on the lens that gets lit up. But otherwise, if you have a program that can load the videos you'll be impressed (iMovie '09 on the Mac can import them fine, VLC player can play them although in my experience isn't as good as iMovie's quality).I'm not going to delve into the specifics of each mode as it's been done many a time. Suffice to say that there's multiple modes and the \"Intelligent Auto\" mode is great for quickly getting good shots without fuss, which is sort of what this camera is all about and what other pocket cameras strive to be. Instead I want to explain my rationale for moving to this camera, and what functions and qualities I touch on will be touched on!I went back & forth from DSLR to pocket cameras. Reason being, I wanted at times to have fine control over my shots to really make them shine and wanted them tack sharp (DSLR), and at other times I just wanted to be able to take a picture and load it onto my computer and share it and look at it without loads of aftershot post-processing. It was always one or the other. The biggest problem was that the DSLR -- while it took great shots  -- is bigger, bulkier, and requires more of you pre- and post-processing to get those shots. The pocket camera however, is easy to pull out and take that shot of the moment, and most of the time its quality is 80-85% at least of the shot you'd have gotten with the DSLR; its real drawback was the lack of effective range, and losing shots of BALD FREAKIN' EAGLES just beyond those trees, if only you had a DSLR and a lens...I tried to just jump back to a DSLR after playing around with a pocket camera until I killed it. I thought that for sure, I would be happier having the range, and I could put up with the initial time & effort investment as well as the post-processing requirements to have that extra 15-20% quality back. But I was wrong. As the saying goes, \"the best camera is the one that you have with you,\" and to that I would add the trailer \"and are willing to take out of the case.\"I settled on the ZS3 because it has successfully managed to fill the roles of both long-range DSLR & quick-draw pocket camera rather well with very insignificant costs: it's as pocketable as the pocket cameras but has the range of a long lens DSLR setup! the quality is better than a regular pocket camera if not quite on par with a DSLR rig, but for the slight (ever so slight) quality hit, you are removed from all the pre- & post-processing requirements of a heavier-duty camera setup.The HD video capabilities put it in a class by itself right now -- you can't get the lens reach AND video quality that this camera offers short of the Canon Rebel XTi (arguable) or the mid-range Nikon DSLRs right now, which to compete would need a good 300mm lens which would put the total cost well above the $1K mark with just ONE lens and only half the lens range of the Panny, and it doesn't fit in a pocket (unless you have extremely large, freakish pockets ;-) ).To me it seemed that in order to outshoot the ZS3 in both stills & motion pictures, I'd have to aim a little higher in the DSLR market than where I was and talk myself into investing more into lenses as well. All that money spent it would seem, just to equal the power & ability of what Panasonic was able to fit into my shirt pocket, and for 1/4 the proposed cost either Canon or Nikon was asking me for. It was a no-brainer.If you're in that boat, if you're looking to get that one shot that you missed with the other pocket cameras but you're also quite tired of carrying around a BIG DSLR and missing the shots anyway because you aren't taking it out of the bag, let me assure you that the ZS3 is a very capable shooter. The focus time leaves a little to be desired sometimes, but digital shots are dirt cheap with a 16GB card inside so I just try try again and I find I'm rarely disappointed at any missed shots. The sharpness I get is on par with my old Canon DSLRs and far exceeds my experience with other pocket cameras.I cannot recommend this camera enough. My only compliant -- besides the focus time -- is lack of GPS tagging, but alas, for the cost, I can't complain too much.

The choices came down to the Panasonic ZS3 and the Sony CyberShot DSC-H20.  Hands on is the only real way of determining which is best for a person, so I bought both to do a direct comparison.  After a week of comparing these two cameras  in daylight, low light, night shots, and video here is MY conclusion (individual mileage may vary...):I'm keeping the Sony H20; it has to be one of the most underated cameras being sold today.  I'll only summarize at the end of this review why it is so much better for me than the Panasonic.  But now for some specifics about the Panasonic ZS3.Pros:Great screenOptical zoom while video recordingSmall sizeWide angle lens (25-300mm)Excellent IA modeHigh quality videoCons:Terrible low light and night shot capabilityVery poor strength flashInability to alter shutter speed/aperaturePoor color reproduction (compared to Canon and Sony)Focus when zooming during video not very accurate or rapid...even when continuous AF and Pre-AF have been turned off (or on for that matter)Excessive noise at telephoto end unless bright sunshineCan't use 3rd party batteries as a backup with the 1.2 firmware update which my model came withNo fluorescent light white balanceThe Panasonic ZS3 is not a bad camera (It was better in some ways...video primarily, than the Canon SX200is), but it's picture quality is not up to some of the Canon and Sony models I've used.  I've also owned the Panasonic TZ5 and came to the same conclusions.  The biggest problem for me however, was the dismal low light capabilities.  I'm not trying to shoot in the dark, but I'm also not always in a small room and close to the subjects where the flash MIGHT work.  I like to use the camera at concerts and in cities using the ambient street/sign lighting.The Sony H20 on the other hand has EXCELLENT low light and night shot capabilities!  Also the video is just as high quality, you can optically zoom during video recording, and the focus seems quicker during zooming.  You have an abundance of manual controls in addition to an IA mode that seems just as smart as the  Panasonic ZS3.  And the final point in favor of the Sony is the image quality comparing identical pictures taken under the same lighting, time, zoom, etc. conditions was much better with the Sony, especially at the 5-10X zoom level.  The noise level was much less even at ISO 800 with the Sony.The cons for the Sony would be the lens cap, slightly larger camera \"thickness\", and the \"not so wide-angle lens\".  However for me, the wide-angle lens issue did not bother me as I rarely take any type of group pictures needing a super wide-angle lens.  Remember, that's how I use a camera; this may not work for you, but don't count out the Sony because of that.Control responsiveness and shot to shot speed was similar in both cameras.  Both cameras have excellent build quality.  Battery life was similar...around 250 pictures with 30% of that using the flash and 30 minutes worth of video.Hope this has been helpful and at least gives you some things to consider about you camera needs.", "Date": "August 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "a great camera with battery issue", "Author": "Mass Professor", "ReviewID": "R1MPX56BPY1PYE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like every aspect of this camera.

I would give it 5 if Panasonic can solve the battery problem right.The camera is a battery drainer, especially when shooting videos. However, it is almost impossible to find a backup battery for ZS3 right now without any firmware change. I downgraded the firmware from 1.2 to 1.1 following the online googled-out instructions. The main  reason is to downgrade is to use 3 party batteries. ZS3 batteries are sold out everywhere in US right now. And it is said that the Panasonic brand batteries won't be available till the end of Sept 2009 or even mid-Oct 2009. Even it is available, the MSRP is $60.

It is a mistake to compare it to either, rather it is more fair to compare it to other P&S; cameras available in the $400 price range that are capable of video.1.  Still Camera Features:  The AF modes and multi-point AF tracking is quite good and allows you to get the shot.  This is probably the best feature of this camera and hats off to Panasonic for doing this right.  However, comparing to Canon P&S;, the AWB and color balance is definitely lacking. It is particularly bad when shooting in ambient artificial light, but outdoors it is a little bit better, but not much.  If RAW shooting was permitted, this could easily be fixed.  For such a good lens, the picture quality of the files don't hold up well to the Canon G9, it just seems to lack fine detail.  Now again, you could say I'm being picky, but remember I'm comparing it to other P&S; and I would think that this camera's shots should be comparable to say the Panasonic LX3 or a Canon G9.2.  Video Camera Features:  The AVCHD Lite will NOT work on a Mac with iMovie, which is the best inexpensive video editing software available, that comes standard on all Macs.  You have to use Motion jpeg which takes up more memory card space and you can only shoot in 15 min. increments.  The zoom feature while doing video is nice, but it is slow to auto focus.Finally, this camera is made in Japan and is solid and has a good feel. It is small enough to fit in a man's shirt pocket or a woman's small purse.  The 3\" LCD screen is nice and you can see all of your settings on it. In the real world price vs. performance is key and you can't have everything. That said, this camera is more appropriately priced at $300 and would then merit 4 stars.  At nearly $400, for what you get, 3 stars is the best one could give it.EDITED 26 OCT 2009 (updated from 3-stars to 4-stars):1.  AVCHD Lite format can now be read by iMovie 09 on all Macs.  It works great, and although I didn't play the video on a large screen, on a 24\" LCD monitor the 720p video looks good.  The microphone pickup is quite good too.  On a 16GB SD card you can get well over 2 hours of video, but battery life is eaten up even without zooming so actually getting continuous 2 hours is not possible.2.  Setting a maximum ISO will help in reducing noise, particularly chroma noise, but it will drop the shutter speed too low where image stabilization becomes less useful.3.  The price is now approximately between $270-$290 which makes this P&S; camera a better deal, but if you have to spend full retail, then research what the alternatives are since color balance is an issue.

It is a nice slim pocket camera, but the photo quality was satisfactory at best. This panasonic camera has the best selection of variability for a point and shoot camera as far as wide:zoom ratio with optical lenses, and good MP.

Period.", "Author": "B. D. Soufi", "ReviewID": "R2P9LNH9KNC2KX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would like to begin by acknowledging that the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 is the finest compact digital imaging product ever made. I'm a quasi-professional digital media enthusiast with many years of experience in film and photography and I've taken over three months to experiment with the ZS3 before writing this review.Why I chose the ZS3:I conducted over four months of intense research before choosing the Panasonic ZS3. First I was planning to purchase a \"bridge\" camera (a crippled DSLR with a fixed super-zoom lens) like the Sony Cybershot HX1 or the Canon PowerShot SX1 IS. I thought about it for a while and almost made a purchase. Then, through a flash of wisdom, I asked myself this question: what's the point of sacrificing the superior image quality of a DSLR for a camera that's neither cheap nor portable? I continued my research and, much to my surprise, discovered a pocket-sized camera with a wide-angle 12X zoom lens, providing a 35mm-equivalent focal length of 25-300mm. I thought I was hallucinating. I used to own a fantastic Olympus DSLR and I couldn't achieve the zoom range of the ZS3 with two expensive DSLR lenses COMBINED. The ZS3 has enabled me to integrate my skills in film and photography with a single compact camera that gives more bang per buck and cubic inch than any other camera out there.My observations/suggestions (after 3 months of testing):>Durable. This thing is solid as a rock and heavy for its size. At the same time, it'll fit in almost any pocket.>Video quality is fantastic at 720p with good lighting. Video can be grainy in low light, as with most cameras.>Despite limited manual settings, HDR photography IS indeed doable with the ZS3! Simply adjust the EV (exposure) between -2 and +2. Make sure to use a tripod. Take 3 photos at -2, 0, and +2, respectively to achieve optimal results. Then, of course, you'll need software to combine and modify these images to produce the HDR effect.>You can't manually adjust the focus, aperture, or shutter speed, though you can do just about everything else!>Never go above ISO 400! The image noise is unacceptable, as with almost all small-sensor cameras.>The iA feature almost always produces optimal results in good lighting. You can also take great photos in low light if you lock the ISO at a maximum of 400 and keep the camera very steady, preferably with a tripod or solid surface.>This camera can do both telephoto and macro. There are even dedicated macro settings that enable you to focus on objects less than 1cm away from the lens. The \"macro zoom\" setting allows you to digitally zoom in to get even closer. Using that setting, I was able to clearly see the pixels on my monitor!>This camera is powerful, but discreet. With a DSLR, you may attract a lot of unwanted attention from security and thieves alike. In my international travels, I've been stopped by security guards on multiple occasions for simply taking photos of public places with a DSLR. Some parts of the world are still a little cameraphobic. Using a small camera, I've never run into problems with security (or thieves). By the way, the Olympus DSRL I mentioned earlier was stolen on one my international trips due to its high resale value. Compact cameras look innocent, so you'll be able to do more and capture more with a compact camera like the ZS3.>Take time to discover all the features and functions of this camera to get the most out of it.>I recommend getting an additional battery if plan to travel or do a lot of video recording. I got the SterlingTek's POWWER Panasonic DMW BCG10PP Digital Camera ID secured battery and it works beautifully with about twice the battery life of the ZS3's stock battery.>At under $250, you will not find a more capable camera on the market. This same exact camera used to cost $400.Who should own a ZS3?:Anyone who believes, as I do, that the best photos are the result of being in the right place at the right time should own a ZS3. Skill is not as important as luck--that's what I learned after 10 years of photography. The ZS3 is small enough to carry around 24-7. Life is unpredictable. Never miss another great shot that was too good to plan for. If you want a powerful camera that you can use while being discreet and mobile, the ZS3 is your best option as of January, 2010. If you're willing to wait several months, keep an eye out for future compact cameras that may very well top this one. Until then, rest assured that the ZS3 is the king of compacts.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just do it!!!!", "Author": "Ana Palm \"Ana Palm\"", "ReviewID": "R1XBQHIPJ2O3M8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 10MP Digital Camera with 12x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3 inch LCD (Blue)I am so in love with this camera, it's not even funny. I am NOT a pro, nor want to be, just wanted a camera which I could point and shoot and get a good quality photo and video.I love that the video has zoom, that is what I was waiting for. Took some videos and pictures of my son and they came out excellent.No more out of focus or too far of a image that you cannot identify the person in the picture.Since it's small, you can have it in your purse or in your pocket. I have mine with me at all times now.This is my 3rd Lumix and hope to be like that for a long while. It's expensive, no doubt, but I looked at it as an investment and I am confident I did the right thing.I was debating between the ZS3 and the SX200 Canon, after lots of research I went with the ZS3. The 3 major reason were:1) Canon has the flash were your finger goes.2) The Lumix can produce a HD \"light\" video (which I can keep and show on TV with very high quality or convert it to a good youtube video and upload for others).3) The zoom on the video. Ahhhh what a bless!!! Finally we can have a video with the zoom.So for all the above reason I say, the ZS3 is the camera to have.", "Date": "May 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "DMC ZS3--  High expectations, Total disappointment !!!", "Author": "Deniz Balci", "ReviewID": "RX5LBOS9NLO1Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok. I am not a pro, just a P&S; user. I have a Fuji F30 and my brother has a Canon SD 850. I would say F30 takes incredible pictures in low light ( I still remember how disappointed was a friend comparing the performance of his new canon G series with my F30 during sunset on a cruise ship  )and in daylight scenery. I also think Canon takes great pics in good light with a lower indoor performance than F30.When I decided that its time for an upgrade, I determined that I need something that will enable me to increase my technical skills with at least 10x zoom for close ups and my wife insisted we have something taking decent videos (preferably HD recording). As I did 2.5 years ago I went online dpreviewdotcom, found the superzoom comparison read it to the end, downgraded my options to Panny ZS3, Canon SX200 and Sony H 20. I went on with amazon reading almost every posting about them. I ordered ZS3. It came in 2 days and here is what we think of it:Build:Its solid and have a sturdy feeling, I would not criticise anythingDesign:I think usage of buttons was pretty practical however you got to used to the menus.BatteryI could take 153 pictures and 18 small clips (less than a minute) with a fully charged batteryZoom + FocusI think the major strength of this camera is its decent wide angle zoom and focus.VideoHD video is a great plus and its stereo sound is amazing we connected the ZS3 to our HD LCD TV and did really enjoy the outcome. Plus my wife loved the dedicated camera record button...However for me it all comes down to image quality. So I will share in brief of my  experience in different conditions:INDOORunbelievebly poor. We were not able take a good pic of our 1 year old standing accross the room. You would not believe how poor quality (dark and grainy) was the images ok it took slightly better one in 6-10 pics however still not comparable to my old friend F30. Where is the difference between a 10Mp and a 6 Mp gone? I went to the manual. read from the beginning but there is actually little you can do about it and it helps only 1 in 5 pics. I could never understand how a camera takes incredibly different pictures in the same mode just between couple of seconds on and on.OUTSIDE DAYLIGHTI took some pics with friends than took several more from the top floor scenery at 4.30 pm with ZS3 and F30, came home and looked at my computer. I was totally disappointed with the performance of ZS3 comparing to  f30.BEACHThan we went to beach, it was almost 7 pm and took a dozen more pics, same scenes with different modes. When I reviewed them on the computer I decided to send it back and order Canon sx 200.  (Ok some will say (posted here already )that this is a superzoom suffering in low light because of smaller ccd sensor, there are a alot of details or print outs will be good and I should have practised more... etc.My answer is, I am sorry but thats not my problem. When I pay a camera over 300, I want to be able to take a decent picture of my kid when I want to without suffering taking 5 pictures for a good one. Plus I hate photography processing with software  on the computer, simply dont like spending time for it.)This time I did not want to make a mistake and went to a bestbuy and came across Canon and Sony H20. I will not make another comparison just say that I ordered Sony H 20 giving Canon couple of more years to improve on the compact superzoom segment. Hope this helps and saves time.

However when i received it i noticed that that the construction quality was definitely not in the same league as our former TZ3 and TZ4 cameras :(  The battery too was \"MADE IN CHINA\" compared to the former \"Made in Japan\" batteries :(We have barely used it for 2 weeks and yes the picture quality was definitely better than the TZ4 by a mile.  The video was also great and the stereo mics gave much better voice quality than the previous model.  The custom mode also allowed you to tweak options that allowed some level of control for creative photography and non flash photography.  The high ISO quality was also much improved over the former models.However the saddest part was that the lcd screen just cracked, and the outside screen has no damage indicating that the quality of the lcd screen inside is very poor.  Seems like Panasonic has dropped its legendary quality which has made it famous in the P&S; superzoom market :(I am hoping to send the unit back to amazon for replacement since this happened without any drop or misuse and there is no damage outside.  Searching on the Internet showed that this was a common problem with the ZS3 (also called TZ7) and the problem seems to be in the lower part of the lcd unit.  Many users have got the screen replaced based on the fact that its an issue with the construction quality as the outside glass like cover has no damages, though Panasonic has in some cases refused to honor the warranty and asked over 150$ to replace the lcd!!! which is ridiculous.  Check flickr for images of damaged units posted by other customers of the same camera.The issue is not with the external cover outside, so pasting a screen protector is of no use since the crack come in the lcd panel that is inside!  Once this happens the screen also has vertical purple/pink bars that completely shuts of any photography capability since you only have the lcd to focus (as there is no viewfinder in this camera).I contacted Panasonic support and seems they do not respond to customer issues, and will now have to depend on Amazon's customer support (whom i am told are much better thankfully) to get a replacement since i am still within the return window.UPDATE> Amazon was VERY very prompt and shipped a replacement the very next day i started the return process.  The kept me fully updated of the process.  Superb stuff amazon.  Panasonic support finally woke up and agreed to provide a replacement unit as well as long as the unit was within the 1 year warranty period, the only difference being that they will only provide a refurbished item.  However my confidence in the build quality of this model is now low, and would most probably be switching to the new Sony HX5V as the ZS7 seems to be going on the marketing line and forgetting what made the lumix compact superzooms so great.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worthy, but don't expect miracles if you're a DSLR user", "Author": "M. Grady \"m11ka\"", "ReviewID": "R1Y7CQQ97RGUNA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for 4 months now, and overall I'm very happy I purchased it (even at the time for $369).  But, though it takes respectable photos, I think I might have had higher expectations than I should have.  I also own a Nikon D40 DSLR and the ZS3's photo quality and versatility really doesn't compare, especially in low light.But, I can't fit the D40 in my coat pocket.  I can't shoot HD video with my D40.  And, I can't match the convenience and portibility of the ZS3 with the D40.  Essentially, these two cameras compliment each other nicely.The PROS of the ZS3:- Small.  Not miraculously small, but small enough for a coat pocket or little bag.- Solid Construction.  A nice weight and sturdiness.  It feels really nice in the hand.- Excellent photo quality in daylight.  Really nice looking photos up to 200 film speed.- Optical Range. 25-300mm equivilent.  Honestly, 300 is more than enough for me (I'll break out the DSLR if I'm doing some nature stuff that requires 300mm).  But, every once in a while it's handy.  It's the 25mm that is vital, especially for small rooms or spaces.  Or, if you have a toddler coming at you really fast.  I find it's a huge advantage compared to the other super-zooms.- HD video.  The quality is exceptional for a camera.  Additionally, it does relatively well in low light conditions - or indoors.  The ability to zoom optically is very useful.  It's extremely convenient.  I absolutely love this feature.  I'd almost be happy with this camera if it only took video!- Impressive iA/AUTO feature, if you don't want to think or are handing the camera to anyone who hasn't used it before.The CONS of the ZS3- Very few manual settings.  No setting Apeture.  No setting Shutter.  Though, you can set Film Speed which is nice (I tend to set mine to 80 - or max 200 - when I'm concerned about noise).  It feels like the dslr \"Program\" setting in that sense.- Really confusing menu.  My wife (who's an excellent photographer, but doesn't use this camera much) still can't figure this thing out.  Heck, I still get disoriented figuring out where things are and when to press what.  It's FAR from an intuitive camera if your not just using iA for everything.- Really bad low light color photo quality (though I should note that low light video is pretty impressive).  Lot of yellow fringing at high ISO's.  But, more respectable (and usable) low light results when set to BW.- Really annoying toggling between Photo and Playback settings.  Basically, after you take a photo you can only review the one photo that you just took (without being able to zoom).  If you want to review further, you have to switch out of Photo and toggle to Playback which closes up and shuts down the lens.  It can be tedious and make you miss some shots.- Slippy Menu Dial on top.  I read other people's complaints about this and thought them silly, but having owned the camera, I've discovered it is more than annoying.  I've taken dozens of photos not realizing I slipped my camera onto a night setting by mistake because the dial is so loosy-goosy.  How did I not notice?  See above - I didn't bother going to Playback to review because it's tedious and I didn't want to miss any action.- Battery life - even when not shooting video, this thing eats through batteries.  If you are on a day trip, you'll have to be cognizant of your battery power.  As of now it's hard to find affordable back up batteries.To review:  The ZS3 is pocketable and can take some fantastic photos, especially in good light.  Just don't expect photo miracles - It's still a point and shooter, though a better than average one with pleasing results overall.  The miracle on this camera is in the video.  I love the video on this camera and find it easy, convenient and excellent in quality.", "Date": "October 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Product EXCEPT for Fragile LCD & Awful White Balance", "Author": "Bob Dylan Fan", "ReviewID": "RBAYCR77MF4N4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This camera is a great package, and other reviwers have done a great job highlighting the features of the product.

Mine broke under normal usage, and while panasonic replaced the camera, they sent me the wrong color replacement!(2)  The white balance is often wrong:  This is the deal breaker.  It often casts a bluish/purplish overtone to the pictures.  Its a well known problem, you can search the web to find out more.  For some strange reason, many seem to just ignore this fault.

I have an elph and Rebel XTi, as well as a Canon Video camera... I am a Canon fan. I wanted a new camera so I naturally went towards the Canon SX200IS. I did lots of reading and found out that in the Super Zoom class, you have Panasonic and Canon for the most part. Great... now I just have to decide on which camera. Panasonic has better overall reviews, but the Canon certainly is not bad and it has full manual control... Done. I bought the Canon SX200IS.I received from Amazon just in time for our annual Tulip Festival. Lots of pictures and video to be taken. I'll start by saying the pictures were great from this camera. I wish you could zoom while taking video, but it wasn't bad. The flash popping up wasn't bad either. It only got in the way during the first few 'shoots'.The bad... the interface. I did not like the interface. It was too hard to choose scenes. Some scenes are easy to get too, and some not. The auto mode did not do as well as I wanted. My wife took it to a Red Wings Hockey game and she turned it off easy mode.Finally, after a few days I noticed I would turn the camera off and the pop up flash would stay up. Not good as the camera is small enough to out in your pocket. I easily saw myself turning off and popping the camera in my pocket without looking... there goes the flash! I didn't, but if I wasn't paying attention, I may have. I also thought that I would never use the manual controls with all of the scenes on the camera.I then went to Amazon and ordered the Panasonic ZS3. I got it and within 5 days I returned the Canon. The form factor is much nicer. Both camera are about the same size, but the ZS3 seems smaller. I don't know what Panasonic did, but the camera just 'felt' better in my hands.The interface... Panasonic did there homework! Quick menu and easy access to all scenes. Separate button to take video. Nice! Love the interface. Within a couple clicks you can choose size, ISO, max film speed, auto white balance and more. Or you can leave it in automatic and let the camera decide. Most of the time, the camera will make the right choice. The ZS3 made better choices than the SX200is most of the time. The automatic mode seemed to be more intelligent than Canon's. I am not going to miss the full manual control.Photos are as good as the Canon in my opinion.Live histogram.High speed burst... it get's about 10 frames a second when you shoot 3 megapixel photos.Video... can zoom while shooting.

For years I've been trying to find a digital camera that is: small, fast, long optical zoom, good video quality, small enough to fit in a pocket, has great lens quality, and has image noise patterns I can live with. This camera has all of that and more.Some of the pluses to my list above include the Intelligent Auto mode that does a frighteningly good job of choosing the best settings for the scene, face recognition (something I thought I'd never use, but does make popping off snapshots a breeze), and the wide angle lens. I've just started house-hunting, and a wide angle lens is crucial when photographing interiors of houses.The ZS3 doesn't have many manual settings, but it sure makes up for it with automatic Scene settings, and there are so many that you're sure to find one or two that will work for almost any circumstance - especially when this camera is used for snapshots and on vacations.I'm a graphic designer & illustrator and have worked with all the major camera formats since the 1980's, so I have some basic standards I look for in both professional grade cameras and snapshot cameras - and the Panasonic DMC-ZS3 comes in a clear winner for snapshot cameras.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera", "Author": "Max X", "ReviewID": "R1EDS7NGYKQI8P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All the other reviews already rave about the camera enough but I'd like to address 3 small concerns.1.

Prior to buying the Panny ZS3, my other digital camera buys had all been been Canons (Rebel XT and XTi, various lenses/flashes, and a Powershot SD700IS Elph -- all fine digital cameras). My background: I'm a retired/recovered lawyer, who now runs a small web/print/\"new media\"design and technology consulting shop for other small businesses. I'm a reasonably competent (largely self-taught, not a true expert) Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and After Effects CS4 (Windows) user. I also consider myself a semi-advanced amateur photographer (but who doesn't?).The motivation for making this purchase is that I succumbed to my adult daughter's admiration (and constant use) of my Canon SD700IS and finally I just gave it to her. My wife would undoubtedly say that I engineered the whole thing so that I could buy a new, more advanced point and shoot with a longer zoom and better video quality/capability and that giving the SD700IS to our daughter was simply a vehicle for assuaging my own guilt about spending the money and getting her (my wife of 30+ years) to approve the transaction. Can you believe that anybody could be that cynical?To me, the camera is a little gem of compact, useful technology/engineering. The fit and finish are very nice (the equivalent of the SD700IS). I have not encountered the \"too loose\" problem with the mode-selection knob/wheel that others have mentioned; however, I bought a \"recent shipment\" model from a well-known, reputable photo equipment reseller (BH), which may account for the improved fit/action of that item. I am a long-time, reasonably loyal Amazon buyer, but I was able to get a better price from the other vendor at the particular time I was ready to buy.The 25-300mm (35mm equivalent) 12x Leica zoom lens is just amazing for such a compact form. Subjectively, it's great little piece of glass that, coupled with effective auto-focus, consistently produces very sharp, well-exposed images with surprisingly little distortion for a such a compact, wide-tele zoom lens (there are always trade-offs). There's a nice review of the camera and lens at DigitalCameraReview, which you may find helpful. As noted by others, the camera lacks manual shutter-speed and aperture settings/control; however, in the \"Normal\" mode, you are able to manipulate various parameters of the camera's automatic functions, which I thought were fairly useful/intelligent. The no-brainer iA (intelligent Auto) mode seems quite effective as a fully automatic shooting mode, but I'll leave the full assessment of that to others who have used that mode under more/different conditions than I. If you like scene-oriented automation, other modes provide a veritable s**tload of scene models to choose from. The camera has a macro capability and other goodies too numerous to get into here.The 1280x720 HD video capabilities of this compact camera are almost sure to bring a smile to your face. Although, certainly not the equivalent of a dedicated, high-end consumer video camera like the Canon Vixia HFS100, the ZS3 produces sharp 720p HD videos with surprisingly good color balance and stereo sound (for such a compact camera). Trust me, you won't be embarrassed to put your ZS3-HD videos up on YT or on a widescreen dvd. There's been much discussion about the compatibility of the AVCHD-Lite video recording format with various editing packages. I can speak from first-hand experience that Adobe Premiere Pro CS4 (with the 4.1 update installed) WILL edit the AVCHD-Lite format natively. The non-RAM preview function is a little choppy (even on a pretty powerful computer), but the Premiere Pro editing function is more than serviceable and produces nice, smooth results at AVCHD 30fps/progressive sequence settings and comparable h.264/.mp4 output. I haven't tried the other available AVCHD settings/outputs, so I can't comment on them at this point. My understanding is that Sony Vegas Pro 9, too, natively handles the AVCHD-Lite format (others may as well). If your software doesn't handle that format natively, take a look at VoltaicHD by ShedWorx and/or HandBrake (open source), which claim to convert AVCHD-Lite files (the .mts files located in the AVCHD>BDMV>STREAM folder) to other, more editing-friendly formats. I can't comment on the included Panasonic software, because I haven't installed/used it. Also, there is a camera firmware update (ver 1.2) currently available at Panasonic's update site, which, apparently, prevents non-compliant batteries from being used in the camera.Wish-list: a little faster zoom and focusing speed while shooting video (I'm not sure, but at this time the ZS3 may be the only compact point&shoot;/HD camera that zooms/focuses while shooting HD video). More manual controls would be nice (not a deal-killer by any means). The battery life (subjectively) doesn't seem all that fantastic, although DigitalCameraReview places it in the top-tier of comparable battery-camera combinations. All-in-all, this is a very nicely made, super-zoom, compact p&s; camera that produces great images and surprisingly good HD video that, taken together, seem well worth the purchase price.UPDATE: Thanks to commentator, Matt Eye, for pointing out that the Samsung HZ10W and HZ15W, like the ZS3, also allow zooming (and presumably focusing) on the fly while while shooting HD video.", "Date": "July 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I was looking for", "Author": "S. Fry", "ReviewID": "RZK8H4LEVP1ZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many here, I looked at many cameras and read many reviews before deciding on this one, so I thought I should 'pay it forward' and share my impressions of the Lumix DMC-ZS3. The upshot is that, to me, this is the only camera on the market that successfully -- and at $240, affordably -- combines:  -- a high quality Leica lens  -- 12x optical zoom  -- HD video capability  -- intelligent autofocus  -- pocket-sized portabilityI was in the market for a point-and-shoot, because I realized that I was missing a ton of good shots simply because I rarely break out my Canon DSLR. I love my Rebel XTi and its ability to use $1,500 zoom lenses and polarizing filters. And like many, I had considered myself a Canon loyalist prior to purchasing the Lumix. But even with my Lowepro easy-open sling bag, the memory of carrying that thing all over the streets of Dublin last summer made me admit that I needed to find a compromise. But in my heart, I suspected that a compromise would pit portability squarely against image quality, and that I would be using my new P&S; exclusively at drunken office parties.So I began my research into the P&S; category pessimistically. It seems that most people these days seem to be content with taking horrible pictures with their cell phones, and most compact cameras seem to be marketed along the lines of \"fun new colors\" and have names like \"Coolpix\" (shudder). And the thought of buying a camera from Panasonic (over Canon no less!), well, that didn't make much sense to me. But I couldn't ignore the hundreds of rave reviews, or its status as a top seller on Amazon, so I grudgingly checked it out.The single biggest differentiator, for me, was the Panasonic's incorporation of a Leica lens (an absolutely brilliant move on their part). Even decidedly amateur photogs like myself are aware of Leica's stature. Leica is to cameras, what Ducati is to motorcycles. So when I repeatedly read reviews that compared the Lumix's image quality favorably to that of Canon's SX200, I was open enough to the possibility that I decided to see for myself.Since unwrapping the Lumix two days ago, I have taken roughly 300 pictures. And while it struggles somewhat in low light (a handicap that is shared by every digital I've used), the clarity, color balance and warmth easily rivals my DSLR. In fact, at the risk of betraying my photographic naivete, I would be hard pressed to tell the difference in most shots. Beyond the pixel metrics and histogram comparisons, the Lumix produces images which possess that ethereal 'photographic' quality which I have found elusive among digital cameras. It's hard to describe, but shooting with the Lumix quickly felt warmer, more analogue, perhaps even more organic, than countless other digital camera experiences I've had. Ordinarily, I would chalk up those impressions to 'new buyer euphoria.' But in this case, the Panasonic could've easily fallen short of this Canon-loyalists expectations. The fact that it instead exceeded them -- I foresee my DSLR's role shrinking further than expected -- is a testament to what relative newcomer Panasonic has done here.So, in short, I am extremely impressed and happy with my purchase. I've been using Adobe Lightroom 2 as a digital darkroom, and the results have been extremely impressive. In fact a few photos of my dog, after some tinkering and applying a selenium tone filter, are actually breathtaking.Its HD video capabilities, while not a core need for me, are nevertheless a core capability of the camera, and a simply remarkable bonus for a $240 camera. I do wish the files it produces were more universally manageable, but my initial impressions of VideoPad video editor (free, but not included) indicate that it won't be too much trouble. HDMI output is also a wonderful bonus.The camera's size, while certainly not as comfortable in the hand as my DSLR, is almost exactly the same size as a pack of Marlboro Light 100s, and thus can easily fit in my pocket (presuming I quit smoking soon, as planned). The lack of an included case is easily remedied by the Lowepro Rezo 30, which I almost buy because one reviewer said it was too small for this model. Ignore that review, as it fits absolutely perfectly, has great features, and runs about $11.Of my only two complaints, the first is really a quibble: battery life. It's not horrible, but not praiseworthy either, so I would recommend a backup. Panasonic appears to have made its proprietary 'chipped' batteries an issue here as well, so -2 for that. Ny other complaint is the camera's lack of total manual control. There's no messing with the f-stop and shutter speed here, so you have to trust the Lumix's ability to make smart decisions. Thus far, I'd have to say that it makes better decisions than I probably would, and while I don't like creative control being taken away from me, I confess that most of my creative efforts are better expended in post-processing.So there's my review. At $240, the Lumix is an extraordinarily robust mixture of performance and portability.

I've had the camera for over five months now and have taken it on two cruise vacations totaling twenty-tree days.  Pictures are very sharp.  Color rendition is good to excellent.  Noise becomes noticeable above 400 ISO, but that's the nature of such a small sensor and anyone bothered by that is not using the camera's incredibly small size to full advantage.To compensate for the noise, I set maximum ISO to 400.  When I need to take available-light photographs, I find the small ZS3 perfectly suited and balanced for placement on steadying objects.  Then, setting the Mode Dial to Normal Picture Mode and using the two-second shutter release delay, I depress the shutter release and wait for the camera do its thing.  When balancing the camera on a stationary platform is not possible, I stand with my back to a wall, column, or any other stationary surface, reach over my head, brace the camera, and snap the shot.  Try doing THAT with a full-frame DSLR.As for the complaint that the camera has no manual mode, just how much control does one need?  The ZS3 comes with controls for ISO, white balance, and limited control over exposure time and aperture (if you understand how to get to them).  That in conjunction with an astounding twenty-three Scene Modes (including the best panoramic setup I've ever seen on a camera) gives even the most experienced photographer more control than they will likely ever need during most snapshot applications.  The only thing required to get the best out of this camera is a thorough understanding of the owners manual, which I went through twice immediately upon purchase, and have gone through twice again just to maintain familiarity with everything this camera has to offer.The only things really lacking in this wonderful package are:  no RAW capability, battery life is limited at best (get a spare), built-in flash limited to between ten and fifteen feet, no built-in sharpness control, no filter capability (and I love polarizing filters), and limited color saturation and correction control.In exchange for giving that up (most of which can be post processed anyway), you get more than adequate snapshot capability with an incredible 25mm-300mm (35mm equivalent) focal length in a moderately fast f3.3-f4.9 lens, all in a package you can fit in your shirt pocket.

Bass", "ReviewID": "RR9GTVSRKQWET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent a lot of time lately reviewing compact digital cameras.  I knew that zoom was one of my highest priorities so I ended up settling on the panasonics.  I have now owned both the ZR1 and ZS3 and I prefer and will keep the ZS3, although it is a very close call.  Both cameras are pretty much the exact same as far as operation and menus go.  They each have iA and normal modes, to go along with twenty something scene modes like high sensitivity, high speed burst, portrait, starry sky, fireworks, etc...  There is definitely the most control in Normal Picture mode, and that is the mode I take almost all of my pictures in.  I never use the iA (intelligent auto) mode.  While they are billed as fully automatic cameras with no manual controls, you can choose the sensitivity (ISO 80-1600, auto), adjust the exposure (-2 to +2 eV), choose a minimum shutter speed (1 to 1/125 for ZR1, 1 to 1/250 for ZS3), which , while it is not capable of extremely long exposures, it is effective at forcing a very fast shutter speed if you are trying to get action shots.  You can also set the white balance.  Both cameras also have a button for a quick menu which brings up relevant parameters you might want to alter in that mode so you don't have to scroll through the menus.  For instance, in normal mode, if you press the quick menu button, Auto focus mode, white balance selection, ISO, picture size, aspect ratio, burst mode, LCD power all pop up on the top of the screen for easy access.  I only wish that the minimum shutter speed control would also pop up with the quick menu,  Each camera also comes with an extended optical zoom, where you can get an extra zoom by reducing the picture size.  With this feature, the ZR1 moves from a 8x zoom to 15.6x, and ZS3 goes from 12x to 21.4x.  Here I must give a point to the ZR1.  The ZS3 puts a much greater emphasis on video, and I really don't care about video.  There is a little red button on the back of the ZS3 that automatically records video, you don't have to be in motion picture mode.  In its place on the ZR1 is an E. zoom button.  This button automatically zooms the camera to full tele (8x) and if you press it twice it automatically extends the lens to its full capabilities, 15.6x.  On the ZS3, you have to go to the menus and manually lower the picture size to attain your extended zoom, rather than just press a button.  I like the ZR1's take on this much better, but if you care about video, yo might like this part of the ZS3 better.  The ZS3 is supposed to have much better video quality, but I don't really care about that so I haven't really checked it out.  I do wish that the ZS3 recorded in AVCHD instead of AVCHD lite so I could use the same program as I use for my panasonic camcorder, but oh well.The main reason I chose the ZS3 over the ZR1 is that it is hard to get a clear shot (not blurry) with the ZR1 at low light conditions when the lens is in any position besides the widest one.  From what I understand this comes from the aperture of the two cameras.  Aperture, the hole in the diaphragm that controls how much light hits the sensor, is given as reciprocal numbers, so larger numbers, ie f10, is a smaller aperture than say, f2.8.  The ZS3 goes from f3.3 to f4.9 ( max of f6.3) and the ZR1 goes from f3.3 to f5.9( max of f18)  I'm not really sure when the camera chooses f18 over f5.9, but at any rate, the ZR1 has a much smaller aperture at zoom than the ZS3, and neither has an aperture control setting so you use the minimum aperture.  This means that the ZS3 can let in much more light at the same zoom setting as the ZR1.  This allows you to use faster shutter speeds which reduces blur.  Overall the ZS3 just has a much easier time taking pictures in low light because of the bigger aperture (also referred to as a faster lens).  Because it is letting in more light, you can also take pictures with the ZS3 at lower ISO levels than you need to use with the ZR1 to get the same exposure, which will result in a higher image quality for the ZS3.  The faster aperture also has an effect when taking pictures outside at full zoom, but not as bad because the image stabilization for both cameras seems to do better in good light.  I also didn't notice any difference in the Power O.I.S. vs the older Mega O.I.S.  With the Power O.I.S. the ZR1 has a default minimum shutter of \u00bc of a second, where the ZS3 (Mega O.I.S) has a default of 1/8 of a second.  This might be where the \"two times faster than previous models\" claim comes from.  Anyhow, I found that the ZS3 actually took clearer pictures with a shutter speed of \u00bc of a second than the ZR1.  Part of this is probably because the ZS3 doesn't have to use stabilization as much because of the wider aperture, but at any rate, a greater percentage of my shots with the ZR1 were blurry than the ZS3.  Interestingly enough, the newest panasonic models, introduced in January 2010, are equipped with Mega O.I.S. and not Power O.I.S.  Since I never use a tripod and am always taking handheld shots, many with zoom engaged, this was a huge point for the ZS3.  Also, the 12x zoom is significantly more than 8x, and I think it will really come in handy in the mountains.  For me the 50% more zoom is more important than the 50% less weight.ZR1Pros- SMALLER SIZE AND WEIGHT!- Feels more comfortable in hand, looks sleeker, more attractive- E. zoom button in place of movie record button- Better battery life- Slightly faster focusing, especially when zoomed in under low light- Faster response in general (very slightly)- Has two additional scene modes that ZS3 doesn't haveZS3Pros- Wider minimum aperture lets it take much CLEARER HANDHELD PICTURES- EXTRA ZOOM- BETTER LOW LIGHT PERFORMANCE- Better HD video, with an HDMI out port- Better overall image quality- Shutter control down to 1/250 second instead of 1/125- I believe the ZS3 burst mode is a little better- Higher resolution screen For me it was a really hard decision which one to keep for one reason, size.  While the specs make it look like the zr1 is not much smaller than the zs3, when you are actually holding them, it is clearly noticeable.  The ZS3 actually weighs as much as one and a half zr1's and the ZR1 feels much more comfortable and natural in the hand at first.  After using them both for a couple of days I got more used to the feel of the ZS3 so the weight didn't make as much of a difference, but the difference is still there.  The ZS3 just takes more consistent pictures, especially when zoomed, or indoors, and has a much greater reach.  Since both fit in my pocket, I can get over the extra weight in order to gain these mentioned tradeoffs.  The ZS3 takes good pictures, has intuitive menus and is very easy to operate, and I believe it has a good amount of features for a camera with no real manual controls.  And of course it has that awesome zoom for a camera this small.  If you really must have a super compact camera, go with the ZR1, it takes just as good of pictures in good light and is faster to respond, but if not, the extra reach, clearer shots, and better indoor performance make the ZS3 well worth it to me, especially if they are close in price.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Stunning HD video", "Author": "Brian Gottschalk", "ReviewID": "R1XZAE2W24YQV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as an upgrade to my aging Canon A520 camera.  2 things that were prompting me to upgrade - pictures taken of my daughter's basketball games in the dimly lit gym were not very good (either too dark and grainy or a streak of blur instead of a clear action shot).  Second was video capabilities - the Canon just took 30 sec. max of small grainy video.I got this camera a week ago and have to say I am very impressed with it!  For issue #1, I took it to my daughter's ball game on Saturday and tried it out.  The pictures were definately an improvement.  I will say that this scenario is very difficult for any point and shoot (low light - fast action - needing to zoom to get a close enough shot - not a good combo for a small lens).  So, I wasn't expecting miracles, just an improvement over the Canon and that is exactly what I got.  The pictures were brighter and sharper - very usable.  There was still some blur in extreme situations - shooting the basketball.  There just isn't enough light to completely stop the action.  And if you look closely at the brighter shots, they are a little grainy due to higher ISO settings.  But, unless you blow the picture way up, you don't see it at all and it is still a huge improvement over the aging Canon.The part that I didn't expect was issue number 2.  I expected longer recording times and better video quality.  But what I got was nothing short of absolutely stunning video.  I took video of my daughter's choir concert.  The stage is well lit with spotlights and I expected good video.  What I got was razer sharp wide screen video that looks so good on my 50\" 1080p Plasma (Panasonic - so I can play the AVCHD video right from the card) it was hard to believe.  Next I tried the basketball game - much less light.  Again the video was nothing short of amazing.  The picture looked just as good as it did with the well lit stage.  Absolutely no noise or grain - just bright, colorful, beautiful video.  I even compared it to my older Canon true camcorder (digital, but not HD) and the picture is better by far in bright light.  In dim light, it is even more pronounced - the camcorder has a washed out grainy look - the ZS3 looks stunning.  I always hated finding a tape with room, getting it to the right spot, charging the battery and lugging the camcorder along with a normal camera.  Now, I don't have to and I can still get stunning video.  Condition 2 met wonderfully.I haven't tried all the features and modes yet, but with the auto mode working so well, I probably won't use them much.  A few thoughts:-  The mode wheel isn't super stiff like on the Canon, but it's tight enough that it doesn't move on its own.-  The battery lasted for about 45 min. of video, about 30 flash pictures and a whole lot of playing around with menus, settings, etc.  It charged in just under 2 hours.-  If you look around you can find a couple batteries that do work with firmware 1.2.  I ordered on from Amazon for $25 that should arrive soon.  The two hour charge time compared to my old 15 min. AA charger has me wanting the second battery for backup.-  The AVCHD plays wonderfully (no additional software) on my Windows 7 Core2 Quad machine.  I had to install the included software and it still plays a little jerky on my Core2 Duo laptop.  So I'm thinking you may need a decent machine to play the native video.  However, I believe the included software can convert it to a less demanding format (with probably some quality loss) - I haven't tried it.-  The zooming works well in video mode - it is plenty fast and while I did notice an occassional tiny amount of refocusing during the ball game while zooming, it was very slight and nothing more than my old camcorder did - especially in the low light.-  It appears to be very solidly built.  I haven't dropped it - yet, but even the controls and doors are hinged and solidly built - unlike the rubber covers on my Canon.-  The record button for video is a little awkwardly placed - I have to hunt to find it to stop recording and I think I will probably end up hitting it accidentally a few times when I don't mean to.For now, I am very happy with the still picture quality (understanding the limits of a compact point and shoot) and am totally amazed by the AVCHD video quality.  I can see I'll be purchasing a 1 TB drive soon to house all the video I'll be taking now that it is much more convenient than my dedicated camcorder.Edit - Since my last review I have used the camera a little more and have a couple minor complaints:-  The video I just took using the AI mode was a little overexposed - a band concert on a spotlit stage.  Same stage as the Choir concert so I'm a little surprised by the different results.  There is probably a better setting to have used, but I didn't try.  That leads to one of my minor gripes.  Because you can't see what the video mode will look like until you press the button and start recording, it's kind of hard to tell if you need a different mode.  It would be nice to be able to preview (and see how much time is left) before starting the video recording.  If there is a way to do that I haven't found it yet.-  I still don't find the zoom too slow in video recording (like some other reviewers), but I did find it a little touchy.  It was a little difficult to get just the zoom I wanted.  I found myself zooming in and out too much trying to get just right framing.  Might just be a getting used to it thing.These are minor quibbles and don't do anything to reduce my love of the camera.  Just something to be aware of...One final thing - I am using a class 4 8GB SD card and it is works fine for AVCHD video - not sure about Motion JPEG, but the AVCHD works fine with class 4.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Camera, but about the battery...", "Author": "TomK1 \"tomk1\"", "ReviewID": "R1C62W6OF1GT5X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife had purchased a Panasonic point-and-shoot in the past, and frankly, the image quality was fantastic.Now, truth be told, I have too many digital cameras; I have some very nice DSLR's and some standard Canon point and shoot, and a tiny little Casio that is so portable.But what I was looking for was a point and shoot with an extreme telephoto to wide angle, reasonable size and HD movie capability.  I was traveling to a race, and I wanted to take all the kinds of shots my DSLR would take, but without the bulk.And this camera does all of that.  Whatever processing Panasonic applies to the pictures, things really \"pop\" on the screen.  It's almost hard to take a bad picture.  It's beautifully made, and you can set up modes that can be customized to what you need.  It's well thought out enough that you can actually get \"deep\" into the camera without a manual.Is it perfect?  Oh no.First of all there are two major flaws that detracts from the camera significantly: first the battery life is poor.  You get about 100 photo taken and you can see you're running out of juice.  I've tried all kinds of tricks, reducing the view-screen time to minimal, have it shut off very aggressively; there's simply no way to have the battery last the entire day.  Normally, you'd just buy another battery, but this actually has some sort of \"chip\" in the battery which will not accept anything other than Panasonic batteries.  And what's worse, original batteries are hard to find and expensive when you do.The other flaw is that shutter lag is long for a camera in 2009.  This will affect action shots (like races).You should also realize that unlike other high end cameras, the Panasonic does not let you set either shutter speed or aperture; instead you choose from many modes and adjust specific parameters.  I don't think this is \"worse\" for just snapshots, but it's a mind-set change.The good outweighs the bad however.  Unlike the Canon line, this actually has a very usable 720p video mode, and it has stereo microphones.  The pictures are fantastic when you stay within the parameters the camera was designed for, and physically, the camera is rugged and solid feeling.It's good at what it does, but the battery issue (both life and availability) should be considered in your choice.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome little camera - ppl will ask you about it everywhere", "Author": "S.

I loved the shots the F200EXR took in Dynamic Range mode. They are probably the best for any point and shoot, however I simply found the F200EXR to be \"dumb\" in automatic mode. I was always having to adjust the ISO manually because it took the approach the everything was moving in lower light situations. If you are willing to use manual settings all the time, which gets old for me, the F200EXR will take some of the best photos of any point and shoot, if of course you can get the settings changed before the shot is gone.The ZS3 is much different. It is smart. It can detect if the subject and/or the camera is moving and will increase the ISO only as needed. I've taken shots indoors and out and it does pretty well at choosing the right settings. It even chose night scenery mode automatically one night when I set the camera on a table and used the timer. It detected that both it and subject were not moving and used a slow shutter speed. Who needs manual settings with a camera this smart. I was afraid I might miss them, but not yet.I also enjoyed the burst function this weekend watching BMX stunt riders at an outdoor Fair. I just couldn't time it right to capture them in the air and I turned on full resolution burst mode and got some incredible 10MP shots of stunts in the air.It also works well with my Panasonic Blu-Ray player since I can put the card directly into the player to view video or images on my LCD TV.The video is not bad either.

I have no connection whatever with Panasonic and they are not paying me for this review in any way shape or form.  That being said, I LOVE my new camera!  I have had it a little more than a month now, and I truly believe it is the best camera on the market today.  It's got a 3 inch LCD with 5 step brightness adjustment, HD video capture and incredible sound quality, a burst mode that seems to take about ten shots a second,  the best optical image stabilization around (so that even if you've got the shakes from too many nightcaps and have the thing set on maximum zoom, you will still get a crystal clear picture), a 25mm wide angle lens with 12X optical zoom and up to 21.4X extra optical zoom (which, no matter what you might read or hear, really does work - just set the camera to a lower megapixel resolution and you will get more zoom).  It's got two scene modes that you can set your scenes to so you just spin the dial to MyScene 1 or MyScene 2 and take a picture with whatever scene you prefer.  I have one of mine set to  burst mode and for the other I have it set to panorama assist mode, which is awesome for taking pano shots (which I do a frequently).  All this and it's got excellent picture quality that, in all the reviews I read, was consistently ranked among the best picture quality in the business.  In fact, every time I came across a top five or ten list of cameras, this camera was always somewhere in the list, which should say quite a lot.  Plus, it's red!!! (At least mine is).I should also say that, at least compared to the cameras I have owned and operated before, the menus on this one are extremely easy to use and make a whole lotta sense.  Most of the controls are pretty much just where you might want them, too.  The one exception I could name to this would be the button that records video, which is right where I want my thumb to be when I am carrying it around.  Consequently, I have ended up taking a number of unintentional videos.The things that are lacking, in my opinion, would be the in-camera panoramic mode that allows you to actually stitch a panoramic scene together without having to put all the shots on your computer first.  However, the panoramic assisst mode that it does have is worth a whole lot more since it lets you line your shots for a pano up perfectly.  The one scene mode it lacks, in my opinion, is one for taking shots of things behind glass, though honestly I have taken several shots of things behind glass with the iAuto mode and it seems to work totally fine.  Lastly, I really wish it had a viewfinder, but then I guess they would have had to make it bigger, and I probably wouldn't want it any bigger.  At this point, it's right about the size of my wallet and fits into my front or jacket pockets just fine.  I have read that the rechargeable battery has a somewhat shorter lifespan than most, but I really wouldn't know from personal experience.Some of the cool features it has is a scene mode that actually slims or plumps up the people you are photographing.  I didn't realize at first what it was for and took some shots of my already very skinny self and was quite alarmed when I looked at the pictures on the computer!  It also has not only color, B & W, and sepia, but a \"cooling\" and \"warming\" mode that lends a blueish and reddish quality to the pictures respectively.  And it has one mode that turns all your pictures or video grainy.  Not really sure how I would ever use that, but it's still kinda fun to know that it is there.  Oh, and it has a special setting on the dial that allows you to take pictures of documents or whatever that you might want to have stored in your camera (and can access or erase at any time).  I used this once to take a picture of my school class schedule for the semester from the computer screen when I couldn't figure out how to print it out.  Saved time and paper!  Also, it comes with an AV cable so you can hook the camera right up to your TV and play video or a slideshow right from your camera!I have just a couple of recomendations if you do decide to buy this camera.  First is that you might wanna get a screen protector for your LCD.  It's really nice having the large 3 inch screen, but, unfortunately, I scratched mine on some rocks in Sedona the very first week I had it.  The second recommendation I have is that you buy nothing less than a Sandisk Ultra II memory card.  The camera specifies that for HD video you should have a card with at least 10 mbps.  The Ultra II, with 15 mbps, is what I use and it has worked great.  I only mention it because I had trouble figuring out which card to get.Ummmm... anyhow, that's all I can think to say other than if you buy this camera, I really don't see how you could be disappointed.

Fosler", "ReviewID": "RV56UTD6SDSU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For a long time, I assumed that Canon made the best cameras.  I have had Canon ultra-zooms (and have posted good reviews of some of them) and Canon Elphs (with mixed reviews).  Panasonic and Lumix were not even on my radar screen until I saw one that a friend had (a prior model with 10x zoom).Being the rather impulsive person I sometimes am, I purchased both a Canon SD940IS and this Panasonic (DMC-ZS3).  To me they are roughly in the same class, although to be fair the Canon SD940 is a lot smaller.  However, for practical purposes, they are both \"pocketable\" point-and-shoot cameras.The Panasonic surprised me and beat the Canon in every way except for size (see my Canon 940 review).  I sold the Canon and kept the Panasonic.What do I like about the Panasonic?-  Intelligent Auto almost always gets it right.  If I want to take a picture but don't want to think about the settings, Intelligent Auto works better than I have ever experienced on other cameras.-  The 12x zoom.  I often forget that it has a 12x zoom because it is not as bulky as cameras that have a long zoom.  The zoom is very nice, and even at full zoom the details are very clear.-  Very nice, high-resolution LCD. The resolution and size of the LCD makes it easy to compose pictures and a pleasure to review them.  One downside is that when I took pictures on a sunny day the display was hard to see.  There is a setting for the display that may help and I've ordered a protector that may cut down on glare.  I don't have enough experience with the camera yet to know if this is going to be much of an issue.-  Thoughtful and useful features throughout.  Just one example (out of way too many to list) is multi-aspect bracketing.  With wide-screen computer and HDTV displays, it's hard to keep track of what aspect ratio to use, and depending on what a photo is used for, viewing on HDTV, wide computer screen, printed on certain sizes of photo paper, who wants to decide in advance whether to use 4:3, 3:2, or 16:9 aspect ratio?  Even though I have a minor in math, there are just too many other details in life to try to keep track of.  The multi-aspect function takes a single photo and saves it in all 3 aspects so that whatever aspect is later needed is available.  This kind of thoughtfulness shows up in many other features.-  Very accessible menus for quickly applying settings.-  Great movie recording features -- dedicated button, new format for longer videos as well as a more common format.  Video quality is better than what I experienced on the Canon SD940IS -- much more stable.-  25mm wide angle.  Recently cameras have been offering 28mm wide -- this camera takes it a step further and goes even wider.This is a camera that I can honestly say that I will probably be using for several years, rather than upgrading more frequently, that satisfies my need for both an \"ultra zoom\" as well as pocketable point and shoot, and that exceeds my expectations both in terms of features available as well as the consistently excellent pictures that it produces.

Nice video.", "Author": "F. Porter", "ReviewID": "R302QC3335YER9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After watching the last couple of generations of TZ cam from Panasonic I finally bought the ZS3.  One of the prior complaints about the TZ cams (and Pany cams in general) was the way they handled noise reduction.  Prior Pany cams smeared lots of detail away. W/ the most recent generation of cams Pany has really improved handling of noise reduction and much more detail is retained.  Compare sample images side by side w/ other cams (especially Canon's SX100 [...]).  So that was a plus for me.  There's still noise for sure, I'm not comparing this cam to a dSLR but to its peers that I've owned and/or used.  On that count I think the ZS3 is a great cam in general due to overall feature wealth and capability.  Other p/s digicams may do better in a certain area but not overall.The fantastic range from very wide (24mm equiv) to 12x zoom combined w/ multiple aspect ratios is lots of fun for playing with composition as well as having practical flexibility..The optically stabilized 720p video w/ zoom and AF enabled is wonderful! better than any video implementation in any other compact digicam yet.  My PS3 reads the AVCHD video straight from the card for playback on my TV.  BTW the PS3 is a fantastic slideshow presentation device controlled from the game controller.  In an outdoor setting zoom and AF really improve the quality of video.  The audio pickup is sensitive to wind and seemed to be better at times capturing surrounding noise rather than what was in front of me.  If there isn't much audio the focusing is barely audible.  If there is audio its imperceptible, hidden under the more present sounds.  AF during video can lag if there is an abrupt distance to subject change. But its still ok and much much better than the nothing in most other dicam video implementations.The ZS3 is fully automated to the exclusion of any manual control.  This is fine if you just want to point and shoot but basic control is lacking.  In any case I decided that the overall combination of features and my intended use out-weighed missing manual controls.  Intelligent Auto seems to work pretty nicely and the intelligent exposure is nice to sort of improve dynamic range a bit.  Regarding automation, it can be a maze at times trying to understand how selecting one mode impacts automation in other areas.  The manual covers this for the most part with lots of notes, but its still a head scratcher in the field when i select one mode which results in another being grayed out.  And I disagree with some of the button logic Pany chose, like the button sequence to enable then lock the focus point for focus tracking is more cumbersome than i think it could be.Nicely, Pany has constrained how the ZS3 selects ISO in auto in that it tries to use a lower ISO to keep noise lower.  Other p/s cams seem to go for the highest ISO possible.  On that end there's a manual ISO setting as well several settings for limiting ISO while allowing the cam to set ISO under that limit.The focus tracking works pretty well for larger subjects that move in a mostly predictable manner.It would be nice if the font size of display elements were smaller to reduce screen clutter.The Mega OIS works really well.  Using full 12x zoom I've taken pics at 1/4 second hand held that have been quite sharp even when enlarged on screen.  I've used 12x zoom and the extended optical zoom outdoors, no flash w/ sharp results there.  Its not a for sure proposition, but the MegaOIS really improves the probability of sharp images.I wish the macro could focus closer than the 0.1 ft.  But at least at that range the lens does not cast a shadow from the flash.  And with 10Mp of resolution macros can be enlarged to reveal detail.The ZS3 does seem to tend towards underexposure indoors w/ flash (and the subject was close enough for the somewhat underpowered flash).In the end, its really pocketable, with a great lens and takes good pictures w/ well controlled noise reduction (compared to peers, not DSLR).  Video is fantastic.

(I also use DSLRs at where I work for professional photo shoots.) Canon's G-series cameras are great, but bulky and I wanted a smaller camera that would easily fit into a jacket or shirt pocket. I always research my purchases thoroughly and so having read at least a half dozen or more reviews of the Panasonic ZS3 and the Canon SX200, including comparison reviews, I decided on the ZS3. The optical zoom in video feature, and sharpness of the detail of the sample photos on the review sites, are what swung my decision. I ordered the camera from Amazon and waited a month for it to be delivered.Once I got the camera I tested it for several days. My first tests were indoor portraits and stills. These came out comparatively poor to what I was used to with my Canon, and the shots were just plain bad if they were done in low-light even with the \"night portrait\" setting enabled. The camera does not do well in low-light conditions, a problem compounded by a VERY weak flash. For example, if you are trying to take a photo in a room that is not well-lit, unless you get within a few feet of the subject, the camera's auto-settings will jack up the ISO and shutter speed to compensate for the weak flash and you will get a dark, noisy photo. I tried adjusting the limited manual overrides so it would not adjust the ISO above 400, but the photos continued to come out noisy. I then broke out my monopod to help stabilize the camera. This helped quite a bit as the camera was able to lower the ISO and shutter speed significantly and the photos came out much brighter, but still not nearly as good as any Canon I had used. From what I can tell, the optical image stabilization on this camera is not as good as what Canon uses. I figure what Panasonic is doing is simply increasing the ISO and shutter speed to compensate for hand movement, rather than using \"optical\" stabilization. The result being dark, noisy photos in low light. As I had my old G7 at hand. I was able to take comparison photos from the exact same position and lighting and they all came out looking much better.OK, low-light interior shots are not great, but what about outdoor day shots? I took the camera for a stride through downtown Dallas about lunchtime, and took a variety of shots, including some interior shots at a brightly lit restaurant. These all came out looking great. In particular, the sharpness of detail was excellent. However, late in the day (about 7pm in late June) I took some shots when the sun was lower in the sky, certainly not twilight by any means, but simply not direct sunlight. Now the shots looked like they had a blue film on them to me. The skintones of my subjects (my family swimming in the pool) were way off, contrast was low. Generally the shots look flat and lifeless compared to what I was used to with my old Canon. So I took out my Canon and in the same light conditions took some photos. They looked superb compared to the Panasonic. That sealed it for me and I decided to send the Panasonic back to Amazon.The next day I bought a Canon SX200 and was pleased with every aspect of the camera. Color balance of the photos is much better, contrast, powerful flash, good low-light performance (for a point-and-shoot), and better build quality than the Panasonic. The video on the Panasonic was better than the Canon, not only could you optically zoom, but I think the video may be just a little sharper. So if video is the most important feature to you, then the Panasonic would be the better choice. I would also say that, if your subject is very well light, you may be able to get better detail out of the Panasonic lens on at least some shots. But in general in my opinion it is so difficult to get a really high-quality photo out of the ZS3 that I don't think this is a good enough reason to recommend it over the Canon.Summation:Pros:Excellent video qualityOptical zoom in videoExcellent photo detail in well-lit conditionsSmall and light (fits easily in a shirt pocket)Cons:Poor low-light performanceWeak flashRelatively slow zoom (the SX200 is faster)On-camera software is primitive lookingColor balance and contrast lackingExpensive considering the photo quality", "Date": "June 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "BEST ON THE MARKET!!

Here is my review:I owned TZ3 and TZ5 before and ZS3 is better.  The quality of my concert photos and videos I've been getting with ZS3 is better.  Here is why ZS3 is great:1)  for all intents and purposes you can place it in iA mode and it will give you a proper shot 99 out of 100 times.  Don't need to fiddle with anything.  Also useful when you give your camera to strangers to take your photo.  They won't screw it up for the most part2) ability to take concert videos and photographs.  As TZ5 before it, ZS3 allows you to preset minimum shutter speed down to 1/250 in the normal camera mode.  This is the most important feature you need because it acts as a pseudo-shutter priority.  At 1/60 to 1/125 you will freeze people's movement on stage.  And this camera is easy to sneak in to concerts because it is small.3) AVC HD light 720p is the most advanced video format currently available for p&s; cameras.  It is amazing.  the video quality is out of this world.  You need to see it to believe it.  And AVC HD Light videos can be natively burned to any regular dvd and then played by any blu-ray player.  In fact, PS3 plays them natively off the card reader plugged into USB slot.  Because Sony supports AVC HD Light format.  ANd Blueray format does as wellWhat is not so great?The battery life is worse than on TZ5 which is a disappointment.  The battery is smaller because they made the camera smaller.  Unfortunately while I was getting 400+ photos at a concert routinely with TZ5 (no flash)  ZS3 batter is at least 1/3 worse.  I've heard that Fuji F70 battery is even worse.  So I took off one star for poor battery performance.  After Fuji F10 and F30 with its 600 shots per charge, this is not acceptable in my book.

My \"main\" camera is a pro-level Nikon with lots of lenses.  I love that camera and use it whenever I can, but there are times and places where it's just too much to carry.  I just finished a week long bicycle trip and kept the DMC-ZS3 in my jersey's back pocket for over 400 miles.  It performed flawlessly.I have had the camera for several months now and can't find much to fault.  The stills are the best ever out of a point-and-shoot, and the HD video is incredible.  The video uses a codec which is still not widely recognized, but there are several video editing programs out there that handle it.  For viewing, I use VLC media player which is free, fast, and solid.  You may find that you need to upgrade your computer, or at least your video card, to handle HD video.  My video card was only two years old, but it would drop frames and leave lots of digital artifacts.  Plan on spending an extra $100 for that upgrade.As for shortcomings, the battery life is not as good as some other small cameras I have owned.  Low light performance is iffy and the flash is pretty anemic, but I have never seen good low light or strong flash performance from any compact.

I have owned this camera for over 6 months and I have made many 8x10's, look perfect, and even a 16x20, looks good, but not perfect.  In low light, you have to change the settings to night or adjust exposure or put on a tripod to get ok photos.  This, like most point and shoots, is limited in lower light.  Yes you can use the flash, but then you have a bright subject with a black background.  What you lose is the context of the picture, where it was, who was there, etc.  So, if you play around with some of the other scene modes and adjust exposure and use a tripod you can, once in a while, get a decent shot.+'s1.The burst function works great, very fast.2.The sports scene mode works very fast, too (great capture of jumping on trampoline/pool shots).3.A great night scene for capturing your house with lights on at night.4.HD video works well in good to great light.

Its portable. I carry it in a little lowepro case on my belt but its also quite pocketable. Its quick to start, focuses quickly and writes reasonably quickly to the 8 GB SDHC III card. There is a delay between the picture and writing. I don't find it an issue, the cycle is very brief. The menus are easy to use and most needed functions can be accessed through the quick menu associated with a particular mode. Flash photography is easy enough and its easy to select the flash mode for auto, fill flash, red eye reduction, or forced off etc. with the simple push of a couple of buttons button. Equally easy to access is the self timer mode, macro AF and exposure compensation. Image quality has been outstanding both indoors and outdoors, I am pleased with the tonal balance. Outside in bright daylight I like to force it to 80 ISO and I love the shots that turned up with that particular setting. Those pictures that turn up slightly underexposed indoors because of flash range issues, are easily fixed with the supplied panasonic software as is red eye. Autofocus works well and rapidly even in very dark conditions. The camera has a AF assist lamp. Practically speaking pictures print beautifully at 4x6 and I have printed pictures at 8x10 that I am very pleased with. Most images in 4x3 mode when shot at 10 Mp come in between 4.5 to 5 Mb. It also has options for 16x9 and 3x2 mode. Burst shooting mode is useful even with the reduced MP count.

Kodak DC280 I paid an incredible $600+ for a decade ago, when I saw my sister taking pics AND video with a new camera the size of half a deck of cards, and doing so for like a week on a single charge.  The old DC280 took many 1000s of good pics for me and is still so reliable, but gotta change batteries after just every 10 or 15 pics.So I searched and searched and the DMC ZS3 finally emerged as the clear choice for me.  This model is heavily reviewed here by much better photographers than me, so I'll just provide a few low-tech observations:1) Bought it a week ago from Amazon for $290, and they came through with overnight delivery.  Good job.2) Also, since the ZS3 has little built in memory, got the Transcend 16GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card with Reader.  Card works fine, and reader works great with no hassles and allows me to avoid screwing around with a cord.3) Loading the PhotoFunStudio software that comes with camera was a breeze and I've used it to view videos and photos on my laptop.  I like the software and find it easy to use.4) The camera has a ton of features, and the hardcopy manual is thus extensive.  Unlike some reviewers, I find the ZS3 menus and controls pretty intuitive and the manual helpful.  Also, the mode dial on top of camera is 'tight', so either Panasonic has corrected the 'looseness' issue, or I got lucky.5) Camera case - It was harder to settle on a case than it was to settle on the ZS3.  Most cases seem made to fit the ridiculously dinky half-deck-of-cards sized cameras, whereas the ZS3 is a bit bigger, which is one of the main reasons I bought it - it fits the hand nicely.  I recommend the Norazza \"Ape Case\" AC165 for around $9.  It is affordable, well-built, has a good shoulder/neck strap with anti-slip stuff on it, and has room for some extras like battery charger with extra battery pack in it (gotta get an extra and rotate battery packs - that is a no-brainer), extra card, and even my Ipod Nano.  Plus, I fold the manual into a U shape and stick that snugly in the case (bound edge out) as well, and place the camera within the U, and that serves beautifully to protect the amazing 3\" screen.  Sounds weird, works great!  Plus, the manual will be there when you need some help.6) So far have snapped a handful of pics, and video in both the Panasonic format and mpeg format.  The vids in mpeg format load up to my newly established youtube account no problemo.  And they look great, even those shot in low light.  And the stereo audio is excellent.  I think I'm going to have a whole lot of fun on youtube....So for like $450 all-in I got a really good looking (black-color), solid camera with great range, that is easy to use and takes excellent photos, a really, really good camcorder, plenty of battery power, and ample memory (two 16GB Transcend cards), all stuffed into a slick little nylon case.

I was looking for a bigger zoom and the HD video feature stood out on the Panasonic.First, the camera is not intuitive. Second, it is bigger and bulkier than I expected. There are a lot of non user-friendly features that I was unhappy with and the camera just didn't seem to fit well in my hand -- always bumped the dial to a different setting. I used the camera for two weeks with no real increase in picture quality compared to the old Sony.Then, all of a sudden, my LCD screen went bezerk. It had a rainbow of vertical lines that made the screen worthless and camera worthless since there isn't a viewfinder. I then went to the negative reviews and noticed that another user had the same problem and contacted Panasonic for warranty repair. After reading what happened to the other user though, I had very low expectations: \"The warranty department stated that NO EXTERNAL DAMAGE IS COVERED AT ALL. Regardless of the fact that my camera was clearly brand new, and that this was obviously some defect in the camera or screen, Panasonic was unwilling to stand by their product. Instead Panasonic stated \"We can replace your unit with a factory reconditioned unit. This product, its operation and its appearance is like that of a new unit and it carries a 90 day warranty.\" The cost would be an additional $135.50 for this reconditioned unit. So basically I would pay $535.50 for a reconditioned camera with a 90 day warranty.\" This is verbatim what happened to my camera. There was NO damage whatsoever to the camera but they claimed it was \"ABUSED\" and therefore not covered under warranty. I am completely outraged and have asked for my camera just to be sent back without repair. I told Panasonic I would rather spend the additional money on a new Canon SD800IS (which is the one I was considering) than to give a company with such poor customer service more money. I know a lot of people like this camera but BUYER BEWARE...you are screwed if you get a lemon camera. $400 down the drain...", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Proprietary Battery and Average inside picture quality", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2D4QC92DYDSKQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera replaced my Canon Powershot.

Compared to other point-and-shoot cameras, the image quality is quite good.Pros...A lot in a pocket sized package.Great image/video quality.Macro setting is very good.Durable aluminum build.Auto setting works well (except action shots).Cons...Few manual controls. You have to go through the menu to change shutter speed.You can't adjust the aperture.Telephoto image quality suffers.Macro uses digital zoom, and image quality suffers if you zoom in.As with most point-and-shoots, it is difficult to focus on smaller abject in the distance, or when that object is surrounded by other objects (i.e. a bird in a tree; the camera will tend to focus on the branches around the bird.).If you're looking for a pocket camera in this price range, this is the camera to buy. If you don't mind something a little more bulky, and $50 more, I'd recommend the Lumix FZ35. The Lumix FZ35 offers many of the same features that the Lumix ZS3 offers, but has more manual options, a design that offers filter and conversion lens options, higher shutter speed range, great optical range, higher resolution, and more scene selections.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love the camera, hate the software", "Author": "Beverly", "ReviewID": "RYRRU2K459SVC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For a point and shoot, this is an excellent camera.  Quality construction, portability, (fits right in my purse) great pictures, amazing zoom.  I bought this camera mainly for the zoom  as it is 12 X optical. It was a bonus that it takes incredibly good video.  Also great in low light.  The 3\" display is beautiful but in sunlight, it is hard to see. Purchased an optional mini HDMI cord and watched the video and stills on the HD t.v. Beautiful pictures.  The manual for the camera is very good and the camera is very well designed.  I cannot complain about the flash.  I think it is does the job.  I think the battery is a little weak. This is a problem with most video cameras. With other cameras, I have always had to purchase an additional battery if you use video. As recommended, purchase at minimum, a SDHC card 8 Class 6.  I got an 8 and it suppose to get about 1 hour of video.  I will probably purchase another card and go for a 16.The software is another story.  Don't even install it on your computer.  It is the worst. Find another software program that is compatible with your computer and AVCHD Lite. I haven't found one yet and not real happy that I can't play it on my computer.  The manual which is on line also is the worst.  If anyone who reads this, has figured out how to play your video with that software let me know.I purchased the DMC ZS3 for $238 about a month ago and now I see that it is up to $337.  I wouldn't have purchased it at that price.  I really like the camera and no regrets.  If it wasn't for the software I  would have given it  5 stars.To add to this review.  I deleted the Panasonic Fun Studio Software  from my computer as it was horrible.  I purchased the Corel Video Studio Pro X3 for $49 and it works great on AVCHD lite format and my 6 year old computer. I downloaded the trial version first and then purchased the Video Studio Pro X3.  I am totally happy. It also works with Sony Vegas.  Sony Vegas is a more difficult program to use than the Corel Video Studio X3.

Most all pointed to the ZS3 as the best compact you can buy, and they are right.The ZS3 is the perfect vacation camera for a lot of reasons:1: You don't have to haul around a bulky SLR on your neck to get great photos.2: You don't need large lenses to get high zoom levels.3: You don't have to haul around a bulky camcorder to get great video with stereo audio and zoom.4: If fits in your pocket.5: The battery lasts all day.I brought my ZS3 on a long vacation, visiting my grandmother, Yellowstone National Park and Las-Vegas. I took over 3 hours of video and over 500 photos with only two battery charges required. The zoom lens was perfect for taking great images of the wildlife in Yellowstone. I was able to capture great looking photos from a long ways off without the bulk of a SLR lens. I have one photo of the Grand Tetons that looks like I hiked the mountain to get it, but in fact I was over a mile away in the valley below. I have video of two Hawks in flight that I could barely see with the naked eye, yet the camera was able to capture them with ease.An often overlooked feature on this camera is the zoom-macro capability. It allows you to stand a few feet from a subject such as a butterfly or small animal, yet get a photo as if you were taking a up-close macro, complete with sharp focus, and blurred background. I was able to capture full-frame images of a few chipmunks that would have surely ran away if I got too close.The video on this camera is the single best feature that sets it apart from the rest of the crowd. On most digital cameras you can get video, even high-definition video. But take a look around, nearly ALL digital cameras that have video lock the zoom level while recording. This means you have to stop your video, re-zoom, and start again if your subject moves. The ZS3 can do optical zoom while recording video, this makes it as powerful as any camcorder you can buy. It is also high definition, and the frame rate and quality is great. On top of all that it records stereo audio in Dolby Digital, another feature not found on other digital cameras. Don't under-estimate the importance of stereo sound for video. Both the video and audio quality are phenomenal. The camera captured the tiniest sound of chipmunks running across the ground.Another important feature of a portable camera is battery life. There is not sense in having a compact camera if you have to haul a pound of batteries to power it. My mother recently found this out on a trip, she had a compact entry level Canon camera. She bought it because it took double AA's and she would be out of country, so thought she would need that feature to buy batteries locally. She ended up having to replace her batteries every few hours. My ZS3? It could go a whole day taking video and photos. I never ran the battery down to even a warning level before the day was done. I took two batteries on the trip, and only need to charge each one once over.The ZS3 is also pocketable. This was important in the crowded streets of Las Vegas. I was able to easily carry the camera and a gorilapod with me while walking for miles in Las Vegas. We covered nearly the entire strip in our visit, not once did the camera get in the way, it was easy to pull out, capture a great photo and continue on our way.You really can't go wrong buying the ZS3.", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "love love love this camera", "Author": "sunita \"sunita\"", "ReviewID": "RILBH1LP30DAY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera..

Unfortunately, Canon no longer makes the A620, nor do they make a replacement model in terms of size and features.  Bought the ZS3 because of the size, type of lens, HD video, and quality of the LCD monitor.  I compromised a viewfinder and the convenience of using AA batteries for size and hopefully, picture quality.  I wasn't blown away by the picture quality, but to be fair, only took about 40-50 shots.  Took a short video, which looked great (maybe even spectacular) on my large screen TV, and sound quality was surprisingly good. BUT.....I was very disappointed in the battery life.  Batteries exhausted after about 50 shots, 30 seconds of video, and maybe a combined 30-40 mintutes playing with the features (scrolling through menus, etc., but turning the camera on and off quite a few times).  I had read enough to know that you can't use one of the thousands of off-brand batteries sold on e-bay and elsewhere, so I ordered a genuine Panasonic battery from a very nice gentleman in Hong Kong.  After I charged this replacement battery up and it wouldn't work in my camera, I called Panasonic. The battery was the right model number, but I was told that Panasonic made a firmware upgrade to this camera and that the battery would no longer work in my camera.  ALSO...Panasonic had not yet manufactured any replacement batteries that would work with the new upgrade, and would not have any available until 9/18/09...SO...it was impossible for me to have an extra battery to take with me on my vacation which starts on 9/20/09 (pausing a day at Disney World to charge my one and only battery was not an acceptable option!).  I returned the ZS3 to Amazon several weeks ago for a full refund (Thanks Amazon!).  I purchased a Canon SX10 instead (3X the size, 3X the weight, but lots of features I love including a swivel LCD, viewfinder, and AA batteries).  I will have to say that the video on the Panasonic ZS3 (HD) is superior to the Canon SX10 (not HD). Haven't used the new Canon enough to know if I'm really happy about picture quality yet.  There were some things I really DID like about the Panasonic ZS3:  super bright LCD, super light weight, and really user friendly menus and controls.  I did accidentally hit the video button a few times....maybe it should be in a different place, but the camera is so small, I'm not sure where they'd put it.

I've always tried to get the best video quality in the smallest possible camcorder - so I've had VHS-C, S-VHS-C, Hi8, DV, and wide screen DV. I probably waited too long to go to HD because I'd gotten spoiled by the size of my latest DV camcorder, and didn't want one of the fairly large HD camcorders. And all the latest flip-style HD camcorders just didn't have the features I wanted.My wife told me to get a new gadget for Christmas, so I started looking at pocket photo cameras with big lenses. And that's when I found out I could at last get an HD video camera AND a great 25mm to 300mm 35mm equivalent zoom lens in one tiny package called the Panasonic ZS-3.All I can say is that this is the coolest camera I've ever seen or owned. I've gotten to the point that for 99% of the time, I just want the camera to do the work at picking a great exposure, and the ZS-3 doesn't let me down. Maybe there is some lighting situation, or creative focus that manual exposure control would let me do, but I just don't care that much.And of course, the days of carrying both a photo camera and a camcorder are over. Seriously, unless you are into shooting near pro level video (or perhaps need better than average audio - a mic input jack would have been nice), this camera will shoot videos that should please anyone who just wants to get nice family videos or even pretty spectacular vacation videos. My son has a high end pro HD video camera, and the quality of the video from this tiny camera truly rivals the videos taken on a pro level camera. (All except very low light, and as I mentioned, high quality audio.)And it will always be with you. Not as tiny as one of the latest generation of very small pocket photo cameras, but those don't have that very nice chunk of glass that gives you 12x optical zoom (or more at lower pixel resolutions). It does fit nicely into a pants pocket. In the past, even with a small camcorder, I would often just not want to take two cameras. And even the smallest video cameras with any kind of decent zoom capability won't fit into a pocket.As the old saying goes, you can't take the picture (or video) if you don't have your camera. With this great little camera, you'll always have it along, and can take great photos or great videos.If you read all the reviews around, and watch some youtube videos taken with the various similar cameras (search YouTube for camera models and you'll find plenty of example videos), I think you too will conclude that the Panasonic ZS-3 is the best of its kind around.

I love the pictures made with this camera, especially when viewed on a large screen. I have been a devoted Canon fan (I own 4 Canon cameras) but the Canon 200SX does not come close to the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3.I wanted quality and portability. SLRs have much larger sensors and will take better images. But they are bulky, and they are expensive. While this camera is not the smallest, it packs a great 12x zoom along with a 28mm wide angle in a pocketable size and weight. You won't hesitate to take it along.What I like about this camera:The Leica lens on  my camera is very sharp, from 28mm to full 12x zoom. (Note: quality varies in a masss-produced lens. Test you camera after purchase)Intelligent automated settings that work well in virtually all conditions.The processsor provides excellent noise reduction at larger ISO, meaning you can take pictures indoors without flash. Fewer and fewer places (castles, churches, museums) allow flash pictures these days and with the Lumix DZS3 you can do without.The shake compensation really helps keep pictures sharp. It also works very well at 12x zoom, with pictures acceptable even without tripod.  Furthermore, the small residual amount of graininess or low-light noise is easily eliminated with a tool like Photoshop. Not a requirement unless you print a huge poster.The camera also compensates in scenes with very bright and very dark areas.All the above points are where my Canon cameras fall short. The Canons do take outstanding pictures in bright light.I did not make movies so I can't comment on those features.What I don't like about this camera:A little bulkier and heavier than ideal, but it is the best compromise compared to SLRs.Time lag when shooting, a result of the otherwise excellent intelligent detection technology (which evaluates motion, light, scene, face, subject tracking, etc.)There are limited manual controls if automation is turned off.No viewfinder.It may be hard to see the LCD image when shooting in bright light. I found it is best, when in doubt about coverage, to take slightly wider pictures and to reframe/crop the picture later. The huge resolution means no loss in quality.No sound comment option. Canon allows to attach a short sound recording to shots, handy to identify people and places in the picture.Anti-competitive feature: Panasonic Rev1.2 firmware disallows non-Panasonic replacement batteries which cost 1/3rd of Panasonic brand.

It is a great Canon EOS Rebel, but portability and taking a spontaneous photo is not a strong suit.  We have purchased two different great HDTVs from Panasonic and really didn't consider them for this purchase initially, as they are not what I consider to be a \"real\" camera company.We did a lot of research before making this purchase.  We looked at Best Buy, Target, Sam's Club, HH Gregg, and looked throughout 4 different online resellers (including Amazon).  After finding the top 5 cameras, we did more research on ratings of each at Amazon, plus many other sites.  We also went to independent websites focused on camera reviews.  CNet was another that was very helpful of seeing videos on each camera.  After looking at a specific website, they mentioned this Panasonic as a great camera.  We were able to eliminate one of our top 5 and added this to the list.  CNet gave a lukewarm review of this, but most of the smaller independent sites loved it.  I wasn't particularly impressed by the CNet reviewer as all of her reviews took a negative tone (this was more positive a review).We were able to find every camera at a local retailer, but this Panasonic.  Ease of use is important, but let's face it, picture quality is more important than anything else.  Most digital cameras come out grainy or, in some cases, so clear that people look nearly transparent (and really require a little softening).  The only camera we found in the $250 - $400 price range with great picture quality was the Sony Cybershot DSC-HX1.  It is a point-and-shoot, but it is a hybrid between a DSLR and point-and-shoot.  Really what this means is it isn't something you can easily slip into your pocket.  It also relies on Sony's proprietary \"memory stick\" technology which doesn't fit into a computer without an adapter (easy to lose), not something sold at all retailers, and tends to be a bit more expensive.  We really liked the camera, but these are concerns.Now to this camera.  We decided to take the leap based purely on suggestions online.  A big leap.  The camera is small, functional, lightweight, and also takes digital video.  It has to auto picture-taking settings (standard and intelligent auto) with 3 additional settings that you can set (shutter speeds, etc. for specific types of settings).  We have yet to use the manual settings, but have found the other two settings to be quite good.  The pictures are clear, but soft enough where the pictures look great and print well.  The videos have a great quality, can zoom during recording (most can't), and taking multiple photos in a row wasn't a problem.  More than 90% of the photos turned out great, but we suspect the only photos needed for manual settings are extreme low-light (but even concerts look great) and for true close-up action photos.  Overall, this is definitely superior to most, if not all point-and-shoots in the price range, and definitely worth the risk.Brick and mortar stores are foolish not to carry this camera, but I would suspect this camera would raise the bar for most of the horrible point-and-shoots they carry on the low cost side.

I still hold my Australia's trip pictures and my friends just can't tell it is captured with a compact! But hey, that was with the 6 years old FX9; I bet ZS3 would do even better than that~(II) Now here is the bonus - HD Video Recording: If you pay a little more ($[...]) to have a choice than ZS1 (which without HD video recording), ZS3 is indeed a good value camera. Recording HD Video is extremely easy - it has a designated 'camcorder' button right above the negivation buttons. Instead of turning the mode to video mode, there is no longer such need with ZS3. Simply hit that 'record' button whenever you are in camera mode, and it instantly starts recording. The switch is instantly fast. With an 8GB SD card, you could record full HD (super fine resolution) up to an hour (about 61 minutes). We spent the last Halloween with kids treat-or-trick in Mall of America. I bet I would hold on to my HD camcorder purchase for a long while :D.ZS3, to my surprise, records the HD video very well. The video quality is superior enought consider that just a digital camera lens, and sound quality is good too. There are Left and Right microphone right above the camera and we can't get surround, but the sound quality is good enought as like a $[...]+ non-HD DVD camcorder.I finally found something that takes great pictures without sacrificing the ability of good video recording. I would say this is a good family camera too. You may imagine the hassles to bring strollers + diapers bag + car seats when travelling. With a single device that does both Photo+Video, ZS3 is a good size camera that does that, and does it well.", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Closest thing to perfect in a P & S", "Author": "I Live in 91607", "ReviewID": "R2RMVG7HR72R0D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After going through about 4, P&S; cameras and returning them, I finally settled on this camera.

Even my $2500 Nikon D700 has it's good and bad points. I'm not sure there will ever be a camera out there that will please everyone. I kind of compare digital cameras to cellphones.

This is a much much appreciated upgrade to my TZ3. The picture and video quality is superb. Yes, the AVCHD video file is rare, but luckily I've had some video-editing softwares which can handle that.

I have never owned a Panasonic camera before and am very pleased with my purchase.  I have always bought Canon or Sony cameras with no major complaints.  Last Dec (2008) I purchased a Casio Elixim when the button broke on my Sony. Mainly because of it's small size.  This was a major mistake...I have never owned a worse camera!! This time around I decided to check professional and private reviews and saw the Lumix ZS3 pop up on the majority of top 10 lists.  I was between this camera and the Canon IS990. The Lumix however has a 12x optical zoom which I did not find on any other compact digital.  This is a huge plus when traveling.  It has only been about 1 month since I've owned the camera but I have nothing bad to say about it.  We bought it for our trip to Barcelona and took 600+ photos which came out great.  The HD video is amazing but the software is a little tricky.  Also, the \"burst mode\" allows you to take continuous shots for moving objects.

Hayes", "ReviewID": "R2CYIGL6URD929", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If Canon were to ever be nervous about the competition in point and shoot camera's, they are likely crapping themselves at this moment.  I've owned 5 of the past Canon digital elph's (the most recent the SD790is), and I just returned the Canon SD940is.  I am blown away by the panasonic ZS3!  It does everything the Canon does, and more.  First, the response time of the camera is excellent:  shutter lag is minimal, autofocus is very quick, flash recharge times are quick as well.  I felt the Canon 940 was inferior to even the 790 in shutter lag and autofocus (I was missing shots waiting for the camera to fix on the subject).  The Panasonic has more pleasing photo quality, albeit slightly softer than the Canon.  Colors are more vibrant on the Panasonic, as is overall tone.  I feel like I don't have to mess with the image on the Panasonic like I did with the Canon.  Overall, a great point and shoot.Now for the true differentiating feature.....  This camera doubles as an excellent video camera.  I am blown away by the quality of the video captured in the AVCHD-lite format.  Even in low light situations, the video blows away any other point and shoot, and rivals the super compact $1000 Sony TG-5.  Where it surpasses the TG-5 is in the optical stabilization; the Panasonic shows far less handshake than the TG-5 (which is a huge issue for these ultra compact video cameras).  Finally, there is a point and shoot camera that can capture excellent video for those times where you don't want to drag along a larger video camera.  I own the Sony CX-12 AVCHD camcorder, and the Panasonic is not in the same league as that camcorder.  However, playing the files I shot with the Panasonic on western digital's WDTV via HDMI, video looks fantastic: sharp, vibrant colors with smooth panning.  I would not feel bad trading the portability of the Panasonic, and leaving the Sony camcorder at home (unless I was on a trip to Ireland or something of the like).  The video is truly remarkable for the size of the camera.Also worth noting; Panasonic was very smart to include HD motion JPEG as an option for video recording.  So if AVCHD-lite isn't your thing, you can capture HD video footage in the mp4 quicktime format.  I will say, however, the video is cleaner and smoother when shot in AVCHD-lite.Overall, for the cost of the camera, you cannot go wrong.  It is an excellent point and shoot with very responsive shooting times, and a great portable HD camcorder to boot.  I never thought I would own (or like) a Panasonic camera!Pros:Wide angle lenseExcellent image stabilizationExcellent AVCHD-lite video cameraExcellent shooting timesGreat battery lifeFull Zoom ability while video recordingCons:LCD screen resolution not the crispest I've seenSome images could use sharpeningMenu system a bit cumbersomeLarger than most point and shootsManual exposure in video mode would be nice", "Date": "December 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Save your money", "Author": "J.

If you attempt to judge this camera by its specs (like I did) you believe that you are getting an extremely versitile camera.  This is not the case, unless all of your shots are in the style of Mathew Brady (where people sit perfectly still for a long time for the lense to capture the image).  I have never seen a camera with a slower lense, almost every photo I took suffers from motion blur (not the whole picture, just perhaps one individual in the group).  In some cases the person was walking slowly towards the camera and instead of freezing their image I have a ghost image of them covering the entire frame).  Also the color it captured appeared to shift from picture to picture, sometimes the image would appear in the yellow fringe at other times a grey-blue shift.  To see if it was me or the camera I took side by side pictures with an older Canon A530 (with both cameras on tripods to eliminate any human interferance) and the ZS3 still had the same issues.

concerts. This sample video is not in HD because of the size limitations, but it is a nice sample of what you can expect at a concert. For a bootleg the audio and video are great! I love this camera!I only record on the highest setting of AVCHD LITE.I'm usually up close in front of the stage, but if I'm ever to be further away, the zoom will come in handy. It's great that you can use the zoom while recording video and it records in stereo. This video is from the first concert I recorded with the ZS3. Epica in San Francisco on 2-17-10. I filmed the entire show. It came out great. The song I uploaded here is about 1/5 the size of the original file. So the quality is even better with the raw files. I've watched the show on my PS3. It's a fantastic camera for what I need it for. It takes great pictures, also. :)My only suggestion would be to have the stereo mic on the front of the camera.I also have a Canon Power Shot SD770. It's a solid camera. Records decent vid (not HD) and pics, but the Panasonic Lumix ZS3 is a huge step up for me.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly great.", "Author": "N.

The manual is all inclusive and then some, because it goes into detail about every feature.

TZ stood for Travel Zoom and made sense. ZS stands for ??. I am sure some marketing research indicated that people think TZ was perceived as \"Toe Zits\" and therefore had to be changed). I had a TZ5 for two years and loved it. I traded up mainly for the stereo movie mode and maybe a little more wide angle. I never needed more zoom. The ZS3 is certainly a cut above the TZ 5 in many respects, but there are some significant drawbacks anyone considering it must know.- The noise at any ISO above 80 is pronounced and becomes significant at ISO 400 and above. It is not so much affecting regular picture size but if you look at 100% crops you might be surprised how noisy the images are. Detial is still good and thats great but the noise is ever present in almost all pictures. This is an area where the ZS3 is significantly worse than my old TZ5. Make sure to be aware of this if you want to upgrade! The TZ5 made better (less noisier) pictures. Believe me! In general the ZS3 is one stop worse than the TZ5. Noise at ISO 800 on the TZ5 is similar to the noise at ISO 400 on the ZS3.- This is mainly due to the \"pixel race\" Panasonic is also getting sucked into. There was absolutely no need to increase the already high pixel count of the TZ5. Anyone knowing anything about digital cameras knows that 6 to 8 MP is by far enough for any purpose. More pixels than that is unfortunately a marketing need for uneducated customers who buy whatever has more pixels. This is actually wreaking havoc in the entire digital camera market. My best pictures come out of my Nikon D40 with only 6 MP and they are just as good or better than what I can do with my Nikon D90. So don't fall into the ridiculous pixel  race. I applaud Nikon on the DSLRs for not getting sucked into more pixels.- The selector dial was moved from the top center on the DMC-TZ5 to the top right corner of the camera behind the shutter release on the DMC-ZS3. I don't know what Panasonic thought that was a good idea. It's not! Now I often inadvertently move it with my finger when shooting and get a dial in between settings warning. A very dumb design and Panasonic knows it. The new coming DMC-ZS7 that was just announced a few days ago (with built in GPS geo-tagging ... yeah I REALLY was missing that feature! How did I ever take pictures without it since I don't know where I was when taking them. I am sure the next DMC will have full feature auto routing so you find your way back home from where ever you are) has the dial again to the left of the shutter release.So there you go.

I wanted a camera that was very easy to use and took good photos.  I don't know anything about photography, it's not a hobby of mine at all, and I wasn't interested in learning.  I just wanted photos to remember our trip and share with friends.  I also wanted to avoid the huge wait between pictures that our old digital camera had.This camera is very easy to use.  I never took it off of the iA mode.  The only thing I adjusted was turning off and back on the auto-flash option when in places that allowed non-flash photography only.  It's really easy to toggle it ... two button presses.The pictures of ruins in Rome, art and buildings in Florence and landscapes everywhere look great.  I purchased an 8GB card to go with it and that was plenty of space for our pictures (I think it would have held about 1200).  I took perhaps a thousand over the two-week trip (but we uploaded them to a computer periodically and subsequently deleted them from the memory card, which is very easy to do).The iA mode does really well with varying lighting conditions.  Only the very darkest corners of churches disallowing flash photography were a problem for the camera.  I was very pleasantly surprised that it was able to take such good photos of some very dark places without flash.  The only caveat here was I had to hold my hand pretty steady to avoid blurring.My largest criticism is that the battery does not charge via the USB connection.  There is also still some pause between pictures, but I don't know if this is adjustable ... I never tried to find out because the pause showed me the previous picture, which is what I wanted (and may be it's only function).  The battery lasted a full day, but not much more.  I turned the camera on and off depending on what we were doing.  I didn't try to adjust the power-saving options because the battery never ran out if I started the day with a full charge (at the end of one day it ran out because I hadn't charged it the previous night).We didn't use the software that came with it, just imported the photos into iPhoto.I am very happy with the camera.

I would like to highlight just a few that I think haven't been emphasized enough.* The 3\" hi resolution screen is a delight.  I did not think it would make that much difference but it does.  This is the first camera that I felt I could examine the quality of the picture using the on board screen.  Playback is wonderful.* They seem to have fixed the loose mode dial.  The dial on my camera (bought in December 2009) is quite snug.* The slide switches for power and camera/playback are preferable to the push  button switches in my mind.  The power on is quicker since it does not require a built in delay that the push buttons need (to avoid accidental turn on).  You can also turn the power on by feel which is handy when you are trying to avoid disturbing a scene.  The slide switch on playback mode is convenient for review and downloading since the lens is not popping out in your hand when you turn the camera on.  The downside, as pointed out elsewhere, is that you may forget to switch back to camera mode and miss a shot.  Again, after a while, you get in the habit of checking the switch, which you can do by feel.* The separate movie record button is brilliant.  Why this isn't a standard feature on all cameras, I do not know.  It is not difficult to push, and it is not too easy to push (i.e. making accidental movies).* The quick menu feature is excellent.  This is the first camera I have had with this feature and it helps tremendously in making the advanced features of the camera much more accessible and therefor more likely to be utilized.* The camera feels lighter than I expected which is nice because I like to keep it in a shirt pocket.  It fits quite easily in Men's shirt pockets.  Doesn't sag my shirt as much as my Rollei 35, which is my longtime standard 35mm.* The frame of the camera is clearly quite rugged and gives it a solid feel. I am sure the internals are well anchored to this frame, however the plastic doors and front and back panels seem a bit fragile.  This is one area that Canon clearly has the edge - their exterior panels and doors are beautifully designed and give their cameras a bit more of a quality feel in the hand.* The movie modes of this camera make it probably the first true dual mode camera on the market.  I think this form factor will dominate as opposed to the video cam form factor (that also takes stills).  I will certainly be retiring the old DV cam.Overall, this is the most well thought out and feature-rich point and shoot camera I have seen.

We wanted a megazoom camera that would take good video, and we wanted one that performed well in low light.  We are adventurous but still amateur photographers, so we needed a camera with a good automatic setting but also plenty of manual options.  After an extensive search in the $200-$300 price range we came down to just a few cameras, and this one won out.  We'd read about the ACVHD video problem - that you can only play it on TV and can't post it online - but were encouraged by the fact that there was an alternative (non-HD) mode and that there was a zoom option during video recording.  We knew it was a little larger than the ultracompact cameras but were satisfied that it was smaller than our old camera.  We knew there was at least one other camera out there that probably had better low-light performance but we figured it would be much better than what we were dealing with at the time.  (We were right.)  And we were excited about the awesome viewfinder on the Lumix DMC-ZS3.  It was crucial to read the reviews on websites like this - they all brought up good points.  Some people gave the camera only 1 star because of the HD video issue; some mentioned the same problem and gave it 5 stars.  This is not a standardized system; these are people's opinions (and this is mine).  Because we knew what to expect and what 'imperfections' to anticipate, we have been completely satisfied.  There have been no surprises.  This camera delivers the kind of quality and performance you should expect to get from a $200-$300 gadget in 2009.  I obviously haven't owned any of its competitors, but I cannot imagine they would be significantly better.In summary, if you go looking for problems you'll always find them.  If that's the kind of consumer you are then you won't be satisfied unless you spend at least twice what this camera costs.

This camera has an amazing 12x zoom lens and a fantastic 3\" upgraded display. For the price and the size of the camera, I don't think there's a better choice. Using HD video (720p) is a snap with the dedicated video button. The AVHCD lite format integrates perfectly with iMovie on the Mac. Even the higher ISO pictures (up to ISO800) are usable, which is a far cry from other cameras this size.There are some negatives with the camera. While operation speed is decently quick, it is not class-leading. Takes a second or two to start up and there is a bit of shutter lag. Also, the face identification system is mostly inaccurate. The camera thinks that my 5 year old daughter and her friend who has a significantly darker complexion are both me, a man in his 30's with glasses and facial hair. The battery life is decent, but for shooting a full day likely will need a recharge or second battery.My primary camera is a Nikon D90 but for a second camera that's highly portable, takes great pictures, has a massive zoom, and terrific HD video, the Lumix ZX3 stands above the crowd.

But since I got the ZS3 about 6 months ago, it's known as \"the camera\" around my house. I bought it for the wide angle lense and the large screen, but have fallen in love with it for so many more reasons. I absolutely love how you can go from stills to video with the touch of just on button. The photos and video aren't the highest quality,(give it an 8.5 or so for both), but considering the ease of use and small package it's great.I dive, and on some drive trips I may haul 20-30 lbs of equipment. Last trip, it was more like 5 lbs. Best thing is that I don't have to decide on video or stills for a particular dive, this camera does both with ease. Underwater is where the wide angle lens really shins.Now after raving about, it does have have a few issues. The mode dial is pretty flimsy and it's too easy to chage settings accidentially while shooting. There really should be a lock for AI mode (my wife has problems with this). If you want much manual control, this camera not for you. I print up 11\"x17\" and the quality is not great there. The lens is good, but the compression is not so great. And the 720p video is good, but doesn't compare to my 1080p camcorder.

Previously I was using Canon A510 and I loved that camera, thinking, that I'd be Canon's fan for many future models. At the time I wanted to upgrade I made several-month-investigation looking forward to seeing Canon releasing a perfect camera for me. Perfect for my requirements would be small sized, a nice 10x+ zoom, around 10Mpx matrix, good picture quality and good video quality (preferably HD). Months were passing and nothing new apart of IS SX200 appeared on the market. The latter after summarizing all pros and cons lost the fight with Lumix ZS3.  I've chosen ZS3 for its compact size, nice zoom, optical zoom capabilities while filming, wide angle and HD movies. I have to admit, that lumix did a pretty good job with my pictures I was taking for the last month. I regret though that it tends to change colors completely where my old Canon very adequately transferred real-world colors into the digital pictures. During the day I think ZS3 did very well easily leaving A510 behind because of the zoom capabilities and ultra-wide angle (25mm) view. It's amazing how many objects can now fit into the picture compared to my previous photos. During the night however or at the sunrise I'd say I liked the Canon better. The reason for that is the sky, although looking pretty warm, had totally different color at the picture compared to what I saw with my eyes. Beach during the night in 'starry night' mode (15/30/60 s exposure time) ended up in being GREEN !!! That is not acceptable for me. Other pictures in night light also had mangled colors, which could only be fixed with manual 'white balance' set (you can set it with ZS3). I was expecting from Intelligent Auto present at ZS3 something more accurate. I also cannot understand why iA mode can't take pictures in 16:9 format in higher resolution than 2.5MB !??? Shooting a fullmoon was also hard to do. Using all possible tricks I finally managed to take its picture after doing 30+ pictures earlier. With my previous Canon it only took few to make a nice sharp photo (with worse zoom though of course). One advantage of the new ZS3 is ability to do pretty sharp night photos without using flash - Optical Image Stabilization is doing a great job, allowing to catch more of the background behind the object sharply.  Overall I would recommend this camera to people who want to do nice wide-angle pictures during the day and don't expect doing any artistic photography. Camera is small taking into consideration it's 12x zoom and has a nice large LCD screen with excellent resolution (460K pixels). When I look at movies on a regular TV (no-HD) motion picture looks much better on the small screen of the camera, than the big tube; On a HD-ready 16:9 screen - movies are excellent!  What I'm missing in the camera are manual settings I had in my simple Canon. I don't think that will come as a firmware upgrade though, cause they want to you to buy even more expensive model to have that. Weird thing is that cheaper models tend to have manual settings available.  As for battery - I thought my batteries would do a little better than what I have observed. I managed to do around 200 pictures mixed with video shooting + some reviewing. For that reason I have bought 2 additional batteries and degraded firmware to 1.1 to allow third-party manufacturer savings.  At the end I wish Amazon hasn't changed their price a couple of days after I ordered my product, which would save me around 25$. Customer service didn't want to hear about that refund :////To sum up here are Pros:- 12x optical zoom (also while filming)- 460K pixels LCD bright screen- stereo microphone- ultra wide angle (25mm)- pretty decent small size compared to functions- AVCHD (makes great quality movies with less storage needed)Cons:- No manual controls- Some colors tend to be changed during evening/sunrise- I think I had smoother pictures with Canon earlier- menu changes depending on the mode you're shooting in, which tends to be confusing (like economy options not available in iA)", "Date": "November 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Everything Expected", "Author": "Rats56", "ReviewID": "R1Z5F6VIWUQFS2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It took me a while to research point and shoot cameras to replace my canon and I was concerned about moving to a Panasonic.

My SLR was simply too large to lug around, and my tiny Canon took horrible low light pictures.Pros: The Lumix's wide-angle lens is amazing because it allows you to capture so much of a scene, and in low light situations the pictures are spectacular.  The anti-shake feature works like gold (I tend to be a little shaky), and it focuses wonderfully.  The IA (intelligent auto) feature is great - it almost always selects the right scene mode.  You can turn off flash and it recalls that setting.  The 12X OPTICAL zoom allows you to take detail pictures from a distance.  Best of all, the camera is small enough to throw in a bag or a jacket pocket.Cons: In bright situations, sometimes the lighting is a little wonky and it is impossible to specifically adjust.  In fact, the colors overall are a lot less saturated than a typical camera takes (probably more natural, in reality, but I like saturation).  There is basically no manual control.  It's too big to fit in a woman's jeans pocket.I will admit it was an investment on my part, but I would definitely say it was worthwhile.  It allowed me to take 2,000 pictures of my trip, the battery lasted for 2 to 3 days at a time (constantly turning the camera on and off), and let me capture scenes I never would have been able to otherwise.

The camera was totally unacceptable.I should point out that pictures and videos looked and sounded great on the LCD screen, no problem there, but not when downloaded to my PC.There is nothing wrong with my PC. I used QuickTime and Windows Media Player (with the right CODEC installed) to view the videos. I also tried them on my wife's PC.

But I have to say that this year's version (ZS3) is one terrific little camera.After taking our Disney Vacation and staying with our old camera (Sony DSC-V1), we really wish this camera would have been around last year.  The Sony is actually a great camera for its time but just doesn't cut it anymore.  I considered the Fuji EXR, Canon PowerShot SX200IS, and a few Casio & Sony models.I refuse to purchase anything from Sony that requires me to buy their useless memory sticks, Casio picture quality needs a lot of work, and Fuji was too slow in simple things like deleting a photo.  THE FUJI EXR TAKES AMAZING PICTURES!!!  But after looking around I preferred a bigger zoom and nice video recording.  Video does not replace a quality camcorder but does quite nicely.  Plus I like the mini-HDMI out the Panasonice has.Panasonic took last years model and improved or corrected almost everything.  The sport mode captures action images better than some dSLR cameras.  The burst functions are incredible.  The zoom works really well and focuses nicely.  Picture quality is great as well.  I was trying to choose between this camera and the Canon.  Both great cameras for sure.  The one thing that made me go with the Panasonic was the ease of use.  My wife can not be bothered with making settings changes.  The menu and navigation with this camera is a snap.  Although, if you are somebody that wants manual settings controls, this is not the camera for you.No camera this size is going to do everything; but this is a perfect little camera that is easy to carry anywhere and can catch a number of different pictures in a number of different settings.It is what it is; a great and easy to use point & shoot that has a great lens and zoom that will take great auto pictures in most conditions.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "This is a great point & shoot camera", "Author": "smkaz", "ReviewID": "R3QFXYU8X7IKJA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned numerous point & shoot cameras, including Olympus, several Canons, Nikon coolpix, and Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS1, DMC-ZS3, and DMC-ZS7.  The Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 is my favorite point & shoot camera so far.  I have just recently bought my 2nd Lumix DMC-ZS3, a refurbished camera.  My old DMC-ZS3, which is 3 years old and still working perfectly, has a small scratch on the lens.  Also, it has been beat up - carried around in my pocket for years, especially when gardening which can get dirty and dusty, and I wanted a \"like new\" camera.The Lumix DMC-ZS3 has a large LCD, an attractive metal body that feels and looks like quality construction, and the settings are easy to program.  It takes decent video, although I haven't tried the HD setting.  Even at the Intelligent Auto setting, it takes amazing photographs of outdoor landscapes; good macro shots, and the zoom is powerful enough to capture nice pictures of wildlife like birds or butterflies.A friend of mine also has this camera, and and I offered to buy his camera off of him, but he wanted to keep his, even though he has an iPhone 4.  He is an avid skiier and he can carry it while skiing and take nice shots of the mountains.The biggest con with this camera (in my experience) is that the flash seems to be somewhat weak in low light settings indoors.Some day soon I hope to buy a DSLR, and learn more about photography, but for a camera you can carry in your pocket, pull out and take quick shots, without thinking too much about it, this camera is the best!

I researched similar models from Canon and Sony extensively in addition to this one and made this purchase with a lot of confidence.First off, some qualifications.  I use this camera primarily to take pictures of my 1-year son and 3-year old dog while hiking.  I've only used the video features in limited capacity (although this was one of the reasons I chose it).I recently returned from a 7 day backcountry backpacking trip and felt I put this camera to a sufficient test.  I carried two batteries and still had over half capacity on the second battery at the end of the trip.  I took over 500 pictures on the highest quality setting and still had plenty of room on the 8 GB card.  I like this size camera because I generally carry it in the cargo pocket of my hiking pants.  We hiked over 30+ miles, in 30-40 degree F temps, at 13K ft, with this camera banging around and I had nary a problem.  I took a wide variety of pictures - night, sunset, action, landscape, macro focus, portraits - using nearly all the pre-set settings and came out with great pictures.  I've even framed a couple pictures at 11x16.  It was an amazing trip and I feel like was able to capture the impressive mountain/waterfall sights well.PRO's:- It is extremely easy to use.  The two favorite setting are easy to toggle and a third setting allows for a quick change in seconds.- Battery life is very good despite what other reviewer may say.- LCD screen is large and display is accurate- The iA feature is nice when you don't have time to modify settingsCON's- Not a huge fan of the pre-package software and use others for most uploading and editing.  Although, I used the panarama builder that came with it and panarma feature on the camera recently and was impressed with the ease of use.- I've had issues with the format of the video, but this may be user error.  For some reason, I can't get many applications (like Facebook) to recognize the default format of the videos.- I've had intermittent issues with blurry pictures.  I am hesitant to blame this on the camera as it's likely I was using the wrong setting or zoomed without a tri-pod.  However, there was some learning to get around this and some frustration over lost pictures for which I had high expectations.", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "Suzanne M. Masterson", "ReviewID": "R3HBW8OVJGYPOA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent a lot of time looking for the perfect camera -- one that takes great pictures & video, has a nice long zoom, is easy to use and portable.  I had 2 digital cameras already, one being a Kodak 643 (reliable, but just okay) and the other a Nikon Coolpix S550 that was a big disappointment. Both cameras take pretty lousy pictures and video in low light, as does my Canon camcorder.  This time I read lots and lots of reviews.  I read reviews on camera websites, and I read consumer reviews on Amazon and other websites.  The Panasonic Lumix ZS3 was, hands down, the winner for the type of camera I was searching for.  I went to camera stores, too, and was told by one salesman at a major electronics store that, although his store didn't sell this particular camera, it was much better than the Canon that they did sell.  He then reached into his pocket and produced his own camera...a ZS3!  That was the deciding factor for me, so I watched the prices on Amazon and ordered my new camera in February when the price fell to $229.  I certainly have not regretted my purchase.  This camera is wonderful.  The pictures are stunning, it works well in the automatic mode, and the HD videos are great, too.  We have played videos on our 46\" hi-def Sony TV, and they are gorgeous.  My camcorder only gets used now on rare occasions when I need someone to take video at the same time I am taking pictures. Despite the fact that it has a 12x zoom, the camera is small enough to pop into my purse, or even in a jacket or pants pocket. The wide angle lens is great for group or outdoor shots.  I would recommend buying at least one extra battery, as the supplied battery doesn't last terribly long.  If you are looking for a camera that is easy to use and takes amazing photos and video, buy the ZS3.

Nikon Coolpix in the ocean this past March.  It made it through my kid's first 4.5 years, but the biggest beef I had with the thing was the slow shutter speed.  Literally, people would smile, the flash would buzz, and they'd start walking away as the shutter finally fluttered.  I'd tell them to \"wait...wait...wait...for it....\"  But I always got people after their expression changed.  I got the ladybugs after they'd left the leaf.  My kid's slow, cute, clumsy somersaults were executed well before the flash, and the video was often my only option to capture the adorableness.  My shaky hands (seriously, I could capture stuff on other cameras, so I knew it was mine that was so reactive to my shakiness) caused LOTS of blurs.I got some good shots the day I dropped that thing in the ocean (by accident.)  It ruined both SD cards, but I got them uploaded.I turned to my husband and said \"NOW can I buy a Lumix??\"  I'd had my eye on them for awhile.I got the red one.I love it!  I took it on a work trip, captured some great rainbow shots after a big northern california rainstorm.  I took some close up of a scabiosa flower, and zoomed in, and caught a tiny little semi-microscopic mite in the middle of the pollen.  My kid's smiles are caught in a fraction of a second.  My hand shakiness is virtually unnoticed.  I shot a duck on a pond about 500 feet away, and was able to zoom in to see the eye, and the feathers around the eye, and only these were slightly blurred.I love this camera.  I love the zippy red, the ease of handling, the zoom, everything.  Most especially, the shutter speed.

As the light level drops, there is visible noise on the pictures, but it is acceptable.For the first time on a trip, I left behind my DSLR and lenses, and exclusively used this camera, which sat unobtrusively in my pocket at all times.Relative to the DSLR, there are some disadvantages, namely picture to picture time is a bit slow (~2-3 seconds), although going to burst mode increases this to about 1 per second.The LCD viewfinder is much inferior to the eye-level DSLR (reflections etc, need to wear my glasses to see it), and following a fast moving subject is difficult.The HD video with a single button activation is great!  Holding the camera one-handed while doing this, requires running your little finger under the body to support it.Once the picture is \"out of the camera\", I have a hard time telling that it wasn't taken by the DSLR.  If it had an eye-level viewfinder, it would be almost perfect.", "Date": "April 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Makes me look a lot more talented than I actually am", "Author": "Weldon Berger", "ReviewID": "R1E1CY9S7WVFC8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In brief: really easy to use, fabulous picture quality in almost every circumstance, well-constructed body, high-quality lens, better than average flash, great image stabilization even at the highest zoom, satisfyingly compact. I haven't used the video except by accident so I can't comment on that, and I don't use the included software so I can't comment on that either.This is my first digital camera so I have nothing to compare it to other than what friends and family say about their own digital cameras. Judging from their comments, the DMC-ZS3 is easier to use, has more features and produces higher-quality images than anything they have in the same price range (it was a gift, but I think it cost about $275 at the time).I have two physical complaints, but they're pretty minor. One is that the mode dial atop the camera is easily shifted, so sometimes it's in the wrong position when I pull the camera from my pocket. I've missed some shots from having to return to the mode I usually use, which is the Intelligent Auto. It doesn't happen all that often, though, so it's not a big deal--just momentarily irritating.The second is that the battery runs out of juice fairly quickly if 1) I leave the camera on between shots, and 2) I review the shots I've taken. The freedom to take a lot of shots without racking up major film and processing costs is new to me, as is the opportunity to review a shot immediately, so I tend to do a lot of both. And I like to leave the camera on so I don't have to fire it up every time I see something I want to shoot. On average I'm getting about 200 shots between charges, which seems to be fairly low compared to what other reviewers are saying. I guess I'll either have to change my habits or get a couple of spare batteries.That said, after using it for about three months I'm completely in love with the camera. It does everything I want it to do with almost no effort on my part. The Intelligent Auto mode is wonderful--it gets the settings I want probably 80% of the time--and the scene modes work well for most of the things I can't get right in the IA mode.As an example, I took a shot in IA of some low-flying seagulls in front of a breaking wave, with a promontory in the frame about a half-mile away, and it was almost perfect: it caught the details of the wave perfectly, including the spray blown off by the wind; the gulls were not blurred in the slightest; the land was perfectly in focus. This was at about 6x. The shutter speed was perfect (1/800) and the aperture was really close to perfect; all I had to do was fiddle with the contrast and brightness a bit in my editing software and I had a stunning shot of a scene that I had only a couple of seconds to frame and capture. (It took me about 50 tries to get what I wanted but that's just because seagulls don't take direction very well.)The zoom is fantastic, the 25mm wide angle is pretty much fun, the lens is great and after some experimentation, I can get the automatic settings to do just about anything I want. I can understand why really experienced photographers might want more flexibility with the manual settings, but for me, and I think probably for most people who aren't professionals or really dedicated and technically proficient amateurs, the available settings are way more than adequate.Last but not least is the quality of the image stabilization. I don't have the steadiest hands but even zoomed all the way in, I can count on one hand the number of daylight pictures blurred because of camera shake. I've even taken shots that weren't blurred when I was actually moving the camera, which should be physically impossible. There's a limit to it, I've had some blurry low-light pictures because of the longer exposure, but it's otherwise really, really good.I don't have a large format printer so I haven't seen what the photos look like when printed at the full 15x20 in-camera size, but I've been reducing them to 7.5x10 and increasing the resolution, and even on my mediocre printer they look great when printed on decent paper. No doubt a better printer and more expensive paper would do them more justice, but with what I have they're certainly suitable for framing.So: If I haven't made it clear yet, I really, really like this camera and I recommend it to anyone who doesn't need the flexibility of full manual controls.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Their warranty isn't worth the paper it's written on.", "Author": "Brad Rules", "ReviewID": "R1T5S4DKXKWB6R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "While the camera itself is great, if it breaks down for any reason you are basically screwed.

After doing my research I got down to the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 (the ZS1 has a smaller screen so I took that one out), the Samsung HZ15W and the Casio EX-H10. After reading reviews on c-net and elsewhere I ended up picking this Panasonic. I'm so glad I did.Aside from the 12x zoom (which I've been playing with since I got the camera and it works great), I like the burst mode feature. This camera also takes great indoor pictures. I very much like the pictures in low light situations (a vast improvement over my Sony Cybershot T-77).Unlike some others I don't believe this camera is pocket sized, maybe your jacket pocket but certainly not your pants. Like I said, I also own a the Cybershot T-77. THAT is a very small pocked sized camera but the pictures it takes pale in comparison to the Panasonic (apples and oranges I know, but that's what I can compare it to).Overall I'm extremely pleased with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3. It's comfortable to hold, the screen is bright, the pictures are excellent, there are plenty of options for taking those pictures, face recognition, burst mode and of course the zoom.

Not many pocket cameras can do that. This is the best value for a pocket camera, without spending far more. Be very cautious ordering a backup battery for this camera on Amazon, or anywhere else.

Aerial shots were the best we've ever taken and the night scene mode is excellent.

The tele macro pulls in flowers from 15 feet away, or longer if you go down to 3 mp, as if they were inches from the lens.  Can't complain.  Next day took it to the local produce market to test macro, and was again very pleased with focus, sharpness, color, everything.  Last night put it to its real work at an art opening doing casual posed shots with celebs and video of speakers.  Flash worked fine for the posed shots.  The high-speed burst mode is great for doing talking heads; just hold down the button and out of 20 shots you can pick the good ones.  The best is the video.  You can zoom to the full 12x and fill the frame with the head from 18 feet away, and the sound is excellent for a built in mike.  The MPEG video mode yields sharp, clear images.

Here is a list of what I don't like about this camera:Perspective Distortion - I don't recall seeing this in any of the reviews but this is a very obvious flaw of this camera. I have a 6 month old baby and I take her pictures everyday and as often as I can, mostly indoors (at home). At 1x zoom setting, this is very evident. The wide angle lens causes this effect, with the portrait image warped.Low Light Portrait - As I have mentioned, I use this camera mostly indoors and using the AI feature, most pictures show dark exposure. Skin tone is also darkened. I have a Sony SR-11 HD video cam and it takes better pictures at low light conditions.Battery Life - I was only able to take 200 pictures after recharging the new battery overnight.Proprietary Battery - I tried searching for an OEM backup battery but can't find anywhere online that says the battery worked. All battery reviews I have seen say they don't work with this camera, even OEM ones.Dial for Setting - The settings' dial on the camera doesn't firmly stay in place and often gets dislodged, which causes an error message. This is easily remedied but it is annoying because the slightest bump on the dial will cause this.I wouldn't recommend this camera if you will be using it mostly for portrait pictures. If you are looking for a camera that will be used mostly for zoom photography with HD capability, then this will work.", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 - great camera for the price", "Author": "Sparky", "ReviewID": "R3K55W7UXQQ1GJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Coming from an older Sony digital point & shoot (p&s;) camera that was very compact but limited in features compared to the latest p&s; digital cameras that are available, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 (Silver) is a major improvement.

The ZS3, although not compact, is much more versatile than an SLR in terms of grabbing it and going somewhere on a whim. You also don't have to make a scene if you just want to take a simple photo during dinner. It fits easily in a jacket pocket or sweatshirt but still packs a lot of features. The lens is AMAZING - there is no other point and shoot on the market with a 25mm wide angle to 12x optical range. The intelligent auto mode works very well, I love not having to worry about tweaking small flash or iso settings. The HD video is also very good. They claim 720p video, but it is not like watching a blockbuster dvd. However, it is still very good quality video and the sound it picks up is terrific (used it at a concert and it sounded just like I was there, no fuzz).

The ZS3 is very portable, takes crisp, clear pictures outdoors, and had great reach. When I'm using this camera, I'm not looking for complete manual control or taking Raw images. The sensor in this camera is point and shoot size, so you will get noise if you crank up the ISO too high. Indoor shots taken with the flash come out looking too overexposed and washed out like all onboard flash pictures. I only try to use the flash as an outdoor fill flash. I'm looking to purchase a second back up ZS3, because I would hate being without one. I have used mine for 2 years without any kind of mechanical failure and it still performs like new.

USA", "ReviewID": "R37UEDUWIW0GL1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading reviews for months about many point and shoot cameras from professional reviews to individuals who own cameras,  I had to come to one overall conclusion.  A point and shoot will always be lacking in low light situations.  Some are better than others, only a select few or going to have a bright or fast enough lens to capture enough light in low light to give a quality image, and they are very expensive like a SLR and without the great zoom the ZS3 gives.I decided to purchase the Lumix ZS3 because of the wide angle lens and the large zoom all in one compact camera.  Now for the reason my ZS3 fills my needs.  I needed a camera to take into situations like gathering with my family, where you are close in.  I don't like to take my SLR to restaurants, but my ZS3 fills that need.  It will take very good quality photos anywhere there is good light, but I find that the flash is not very strong.  The great thing is inside the wide angle makes it a perfect camera for close in shots that I would not use my Nikon for because of the bulk.  Outside the ZS3 is as good as any point and shoot for all over image quality and has a amazing zoom for such a compact lens.  So I use a ultra compact canon for a take everywhere with good image and great HD video, the ZS3 is with me at gatherings in close in places where the wide angle and smaller flash works best.  My Nikon SLR is inside at larger events with a fast 1.8f aperture lens,again outside with my Lumix ZS3 for landscape and with a great big amazing quality zoom lens.It really depends on what your needs are, we all would love to purchase an all in one camera for all the different situations that you want to take photos in, but a SLR is not practical to take in all situations and would cost you thousands of dollars for a lens that would be bright enough to cover all aspects of photography.  The Lumix ZS3 is a affordable advanced wide angle to a large telephoto point and shoot that will give you sharp, crisp, accurate color and properly exposed photos that you will love to show off to your friends in a lot of situations.HD video is amazing with great sound. If you are like me you will be disappointed with the short battery life after using a SLR so purchasing a second battery for me was a must.I hope this simple low-tech review helps, also comparing the ZS3 with the  new ZS7 I chose the ZS3 for better photo sharpness, I didn't want to use manual, I have plenty of full manual cameras.  The auto or my preference the program mode works greats for me.  I did notice in comparison that the 12Mp files of ZS7 are smaller than the 10 Mp files of the ZS3 that could mean there is more processing from the ZS7 I am not sure but some Tech could tell me.

The Leica wide angle/telephoto Zoom lens is a miracle of engineering. The 12X telephoto is impressive in so small a package, but even more useful for me is the 25mm (equivalent) wide angle. It is able to focus quickly and quietly from a few inches to infinity. Using the wide angle setting and aiming it lengthwise from the end of a 30x15 ft room it shows both long walls from about 12 ft in front of the camera. No more missing Uncle Henry and Aunt Edna at opposite edges of those big group pictures! In that same room with no ambient light the flash filled the room from front to 28 feet back with exceptionally bright and even illumination. So much for the weak flash complaint- this little camera provides the best flash depth and uniformity I have ever seen. I haven't had enough time to judge battery capacity, but in my few days of informal testing the battery seems to hold up well. I will carry the little charger on trips until I get a sense of how many photos the battery will provide between charges. I concur with the other user comments about high build quality and ease of use as a point and shoot camera for the non tech users. On the IA (intelligent automation) setting together with the good image stabilization it is very hard to get a bad picture. Oh yes- The mode selection dial is nicely detented to stay where you set it- but I guess it could be inadvertently switched by careless handling. With it's big bright screen, multi mode selections for the more technically minded, and even HD video capability it's hard to think of what could be improved.

I carried the camera in my jeans front pocket (to keep it handy) through two days of hiking, mountains, cold and snow. It performed flawlessly. The 12X zoom with optical stabilization is a huge plus for this little camera. Starting at 25mm and going up I found good use for the entire range. The pictures are beautiful. The HD video is good enough that I felt comfortable leaving my larger HD camcorder at home.The camera has automatic modes that do a respectable job of focus and exposure (though it is still sometimes useful to learn to trick them into giving what you want). But it also has a good range of manual settings that proved valuable in special settings. All are easy to use. The ZS3 has a nice panorama setting that helps you align each sequential shot while keeping the exposure and zoom fixed. (The panorama software included makes stitching the shots together very easy once you load them to your computer).One problem: I used the zoom while taking video in a quiet place and noise from the zoom motor could be heard in the audio. It's a soft noise but noticeable.Another complaint: the included slide show software can make a video movie out of your slides and video, but it doesn't output 16:9 video. Instead it squeezes the images to a narrower aspect ratio, distorting them. Since HD video and 16:9 picture ability are strong points of this camera, it would be good to have software that knows how to render it at the proper aspect ratio!If you buy this camera you should also spring for a larger SD card (at least 16GB). That matches the battery life with memory capacity if you take a lot of video. But speaking of battery life: you don't want to be too far from a wall outlet. It was OK on day hikes and light to moderate use. But with heavier use or longer trips you'd need another battery and memory card.I've carried cameras with me everywhere for decades, beginning with 35mm SLR's and a Halliburton aluminum case full of lenses and gear. There's still a place for high end gear. But portability is valuable. You can carry this one almost anywhere (hint to Panasonic or OEM's: an underwater case for this puppy would put icing on the cake).

This alone tells you that I like this camera a lot. The addition of HD video is great. The strongest aspect of the Lumix line of cameras is the Leica lens, which delivers impressive image quality -- on par with my Canon 20D SLR, but in a much smaller package. I use this camera mostly for web photography, but I've done some artsy, 16\" x 20\" enlargements that look every bit as good as those from a $2000 SLR/lens combo.I am also in love with the ZS3's low-light capability, especially using its presets (such as \"Night Scenery\"). With this particular preset, I've been able to shoot aerial panoramas of cities, at night, from a moving airplane, with good results. If there are more challenging lighting conditions for a small pocket camera, I don't know what they might be.The controls are robust and pretty self-explanatory, but the rotary mode selector often rotates from where you left it last when you remove it from a camera case. You have to check the dial every time you get ready to shoot, or you'll find yourself in an incorrect mode.

I don't always agree with the automated setting combination of shutter speed/fstop/asa, but have found ways to get pretty much what I want (and am getting to a point of being able to anticipate rather than fiddle around).Sound pickup in movies is not great, but is useful enough for its intended use.

I bought it to do some amatuer photography and was really impressed at the quality of the pictures. The flash is very impressive, I took pictures in complete darkness to test it, and it did not disappoint. I love the video feature as well, it amazed me how well it recorded the video and audio, almost picture perfect. And when I uploaded the videos to my computer they came out so big, another surprise. I was expecting 320x120 picture quality but its more than double that size.The intelligent picture mode it has, has the perfect settings for beginners who do not know how to configure the manuel mode settings. The only thing I would suggest to those beginners is to know when to turn on/off the flash. (because it can ruin some photos, it has nothing to do with this particular model but for instance, if you are shooting from behind a window at night and the flash is on the flash will reflect off the window and all you will get is a really bright picture and some of the window) I much prefer the manual settings because this mode has more options as to how to shoot each pphotograph.Another feature I love about this camera is face tracking and AF tracking. In face tracking mode the camera can identify faces of the individuals in any particular photo. (Very handy for focus and illiminating blurry pictures) Also, the AF tracking is very useful when it comes to shooting moving subjects. (I tested this feature as a passenger in a car, I was once again very impressed, no blurriness at all!) One down side  to this feature is it its almost too good, you must be ready in advance to take photos in this mode if you are using flash in manual settings)All & all, I'm very impressed, Amazon has never disappointed me, I bought this camera based on its overwhelmingly positive reviews and looking at its basic features and available accessories.

VLC manages to play them only part of the time).  There are good examples of the movie quality on YouTube, although the videos I shot fell just a tad short of what I expected being a tad grainy and dark.  Very nice that the camera can zoom while shooting video - the sound just barely gets picked up in the recording.  Stereo audio is also a great feature, as well as the mini-HDMI port.PICTURES:The pictures are grainier than the Casio H10 I was also testing and the camera doesn't handle low-light as well, but they come out extremely sharp and really capture the details (I can shoot my bookshelf from across the room and read most of the titles on the photo).  The 12x zoom is amazing for the compact size.BATTERY LIFE:This camera's battery life is one of its greater shortcomings.  The camera I tested along with this one, the Casio EX-H10, gets 1000 shots/charge and this Panasonic only gets 300 or so.OTHER:It's a minor thing but I am glad this camera is flat on the bottom so you can take stable non-flash shots off a table without a tripod.

I even bought a Nikon first, but digging the DMC-ZS3. First let me qualify my opinion. I consider myself a hobby photographer, but close friends call me semi-pro. Been shooting film since 1984, my first digital camera was a Sony Mavica, and I've made numerous upgrades since then. I stopped using film altogether when I got my big gun is a Konica-Minolta Maxxum 7D. About 2 years ago I bought a Coolpix S550 and it has been in pocket nearly every day since then. It has held up well - but I wanted more. I tried the new Coolpix S570, and was mostly pleased, but the recycle time was a HUGE downer. From the moment I pressed the shutter button to when it was ready for the next shot, it was nearly 6 seconds. Almost 3 times that of the S550.So I get ready to buy a new camera, and I narrow it down to the DMC-ZS3 and the Canon SX200IS. If you have done any researching, you'll find these two models are almost always compared against one another. I went with the DMC-ZS3 only because the price was good - but I was fully prepared to buy the Canon as well, and send back the one I liked the least.The Canon has the manual settings, but after some soul searching I realized that I wanted a point and shoot, like the S550. If I want the manual controls and the full creativity that goes with them, I have the Maxxum.Size was important. I wanted something to fit in my pocket like the S550 and would always be there when I wanted it. The DMC-ZS3 is only slightly larger than S550, which was downright tiny. I think anyone who who calls the DMC-ZS3 big and bulky is not being fair. It really is small and portable, when you consider the fat lens and huge screen on the back.Recycle time is as good if not slightly faster than my old S550. Push button, take shot, its ready for another shot in just over 2 seconds. And that is not using the multi-shot burst mode. Startup time is about 2 seconds, too.Lots have critiqued the non-metal housing. The finish makes it feel like metal. Its quality and feels pretty solid. Many say the main function control on the top is loose. Yeah, it does occasionally switch positions on you if you rub against it, but I wouldn't call it loose. Its no big deal at all to flip it back where it belongs.The images are very good. Marco is awesome. You can just about touch the lens to what you are looking at and it will focus. The wide angle is also a big plus. Take a few pictures inside a small room and you'll see what you have been missing with the standard issue point and shoot cameras. The images are great.All in all, I'm very pleased with the DMC-ZS3 and will not seek out the Canon to see if I would like it better.

And even better - it seems I've got an updated version because on my instance the mode dial is not as loose as it was complained by many earlier reviewers but is accuratly fixed in each distinct position.The real wonder is the AVCHD-codec. It's a miracle - there is almost no noise on the video clips taken in the low light conditions. If you switch to MPEG mode you will see as the same decent level on noise as on other good P&S; cameras with HD movie feature, but Panasonic's AVCHD-codec does something really incredible - almost no noise at all. On the other hand I did not see any noticable compression artifacts which could appear as a result of a stronger compression (if any). Just a nice clear picture with no sacrifice.When I compare the quality of the video-clips taken by ZS3 on a sunny day with the ones taken by my other Panasonic camera ZR1 they look pretty similar. But shooting in the low light reveals the difference - while ZR1 shows pretty much noise with it's MPEG coding in HD mode, ZS3 shines with its almost noiseless quality provided by AVCHD codec.

With a powerful zoom, little bit uncomfortable to handle if you are used to super compacts, but you know that (or you should know) when you buy it.The video is very good, I'd say that it's the best that I have ever seen or I would expect from a still camera.I haven't noticed too much lose of focus when I zomm in and zoom out during video. But the AVCHD format isn't very common. Other pro is that the slow speed of zoom during video make transitions very soft being more slow when you start and finish zooming than in the middle.The part that I expected much better was the face recognition, which is like play to Lotto.And although reviews say that it hasn't manual focus, there's an option to follow objects. You have to put the object on the center of the screen, click a button, and then the camera will automatically focus that object although it or you move, or zoom, etc. Not very accurate, but good enough!The battery life deppends on some options. If autofocus is working all the time instead of just when you click the button to take the photo, then your battery will have a shorter life.

Also found the lens took too much time to retract, often hesitating and then finally retracting. Yes, the Fuji is bulky,and has trouble focusing in low light, but it runs quite nicely on four AA batteries (which unfortunately must be removed between sessions).Next on the hit parade will be the Canon G11.

I decided that when we took our vacation this year, I wanted to take HD videos of our destination (Colorado mountains).After reading various reviews and comparing features of the newer ZS series, I decided that the DMC-ZS3 was the one for me. It possesses the 12X optical zoom and AVCHD video capability, but it's at a lower price point than the fully-loaded (or perhaps a bit overloaded) ZS7. I could not be more pleased.The pictures are fantastic - from the very useful wide-angle (that the TZ1 did not possess) to the amazing video and sound quality of AVCHD (the movies look fantastic on our plasma). While the ZS3 does not have many of the manual settings of its big brother, the ZS7, the scene modes work very well and are easy to access.The build quality is very good - it feels solid in the hand while presenting a much smaller footprint than my old ZS1 (it took a bit of getting used to). This smaller size makes it fairly pocketable (if you have larger pockets), but I use a small camera case.Our friends were stunned at the video quality (720p AVCHD Lite) that this little camera produces. One drawback might be that the AVCHD format is rather difficult to edit. It is my understanding that Windows 7 Live Essentials (a free add-on for Win 7) can do it, and the newer versions of Sony Vegas and Adobe Premiere/Essentials can be used as well; I have not tried any editing yet myself.One other caveat: Panasonic has begun implementing \"battery chipping\" - many of their cameras will only accept genuine Panasonic batteries. While my camera has the newer firmware update that requires the OEM batteries, I was able to find \"guaranteed compatible\" aftermarket batteries on eBay for a fraction of the cost, and they do work.Overall, this fantastic little unit is my third Panasonic camera, and I continue to be impressed with their digital photo products.

I take pictures of everything EXCEPT people.Features that I expect to use but haven't yet: Video.-----Like most smaller cameras, the sensor isn't the best. Images turn out quite grainy at high ISOs, so I wouldn't advise that you use it in dark situations unless you have a tripod - at lower ISOs, dark situations will make the exposure time very long and make the image turn out very blurry unless you use a tripod or set the camera on a steady surface, but low ISOs greatly reduce grainy pictures.It's also rather slow. The autofocus refocuses when you hit the shutter button so it's not good for quick shots, and its startup time can be frustrating sometimes. But that's not a problem for me usually.It has a \"hi-speed burst\" mode in the SCN tab that allows you to take pictures either very quickly, or REALLY REALLY quickly, depending on your quality preference. Resolution is limited to 3 MPx but that's just fine for me since that's the normal resolution I use anyway. This can be useful if, for example, you're in a car driving through trees and you see an opening ahead where you want to take a picture - you can start a high-speed burst right before you get to the gap, and it'll keep taking pictures til you release the shutter button - you can delete the extra pictures afterwards.The lens is amazing. I've taken a picture at a range of THREE INCHES of my jeans and you can see every fiber crystal-clear. When set to 1x zoom, the lens is very wide angle, so you can take in much more of an area with a single shot than you would expect. Or if you're going to the other end of things, you can zoom in on anything at any distance, really - the 12x zoom is excellent, and when used along with digital zoom (which sometimes happens automatically) it goes up to 23x. The optical image stabilization is very useful in this situation.The battery life is phenomenal. I wouldn't know the picture count per charge, but this camera lasts FOREVER before you have to charge. I would like to be able to charge the battery without taking it out of the camera, but that's just what I'm used to.I have three 2GB SD cards, and with my preference for smaller image sizes in order to take more, I take most pictures at 3 MPx. I frequently format the drives after uploading the images to Photobucket (I remove the card and put it in my computer's SD reader to do this) so that if I should have occasion to take a thousand pictures I can do that (and then have to change memory cards).Another side note is that I haven't tried most of the scene modes in the \"SCN\" tab, but the ones I have tried work very well, particularly the \"Food\" mode.Overall a very good camera for the price, with a very good lens and a very good battery life.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "I liked this thing pretty good", "Author": "Alexander Hayden \"\"most humble\"\"", "ReviewID": "R27M6IDJZ1ROHH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I liked this thing pretty good.

In the past, I've had two Minolta SLRs, a Canon XT, and a Panasonic lumix. I Got this camera mainly for the HD video and awesome zoom for an Alaskan cruise. I actually forgot how great the Panasonic Lumix cameras are.  I gave mine to a friend years ago and I forgot how great it was.  I was particularly impressed by the quality of a video with she took with it and thought seriously about getting this one.  Then I read many positive reviews and that was it!I love:  the video quality is great, even when played on large TVs...it doesn't lose sharpness or appear grainy.  I usually make DVDs with my pics and videos, and noticed that with the Canon and S610, I lose quality and sharpness especially when it's played on big screen TVs.  The audio is also great - I picked up thunderous sounds when the glaciers were calving.LENS & SCENE MODES:  The Leica lens is another reason I got this camera.  One day I hope to own my own Leica, but until then, I am totally satisfied with this Panasonic.  My Nikon D90 takes beautiful pictures, but when I thumbed through the pics, I couldn't tell which were taken with that one or with the Panasonic.  That really impressed me.I also like that I can preset different modes such as sunset, snow, etc. without having to navigate through the menus.  It made things super fast and easy to get the shots.  There are many scene modes to choose from which is both positive and negative.  I haven't had time to really play around and compare shots taken in the normal automatic mode, and one taken in a specific scene mode.CONTROLS:  Overall, the buttons and dial are easy to use and make adjustments quick. I like that most things are controlled on the outside body of the camera.  This means you don't need to fool around with menus to look for what you want.FLASH:  I also appreciate that this camera gives you many flash options.  There are times when you want to force flash or times when you can't shoot with flash.  This camera gives 5 options - auto, no flash, force flash, red eye, slow sync/red eye.SIZE & WEIGHT:  This is a mid-sized camera that is still small enough to carry around daily.  It isn't the lightest or smallest camera, but this to me is an advantage.  It's often hard to avoid camera shake and blurry pics with smaller, lighter cameras, especially when you ask others to take pics for you. I like how it feels in your hands - its not to small that your fingers block the lens, flash, or microphone.BATTERY:  I like the rechargeable battery vs using AA's.  The battery lasted quite a few days before it needed to be recharged.  I was going to buy a back up, but since I've been using it, I know there is no need.What I didn't like:  Others have mentioned noise when zooming in video mode.  The amount of noise varies, sometimes, when you slowly zoom in, it's not too loud.  However, at other times, it really is loud.  Luckily, I usually put music over my videos so it's not an issue.No view finder.  The LCD screen is great and large.  But sometimes, in sunny conditions, it's hard to see exactly what you're getting.  So to have the option of a view finder would be great.Limited video time:  I believe that you can only film for 8 min 20 sec.  I don't know if this varies with the size of your SD card.  Right now, I have an 8 GB card in.I was thoroughly impressed by this camera that made the \"negatives\" so minor.

I've owned it for about 7 months and in that time I have used it only a handful of times. It was mainly bought just to have a good one around the house other than the camera on my phone. Without re-hashing what has been said in these reviews a million times, this unit is of extremely sound build quality and feels very solid in your hands. The video recording in this unit is so good that it can almost pass for a dedicated camcorder. The video quality is there, the optical zoom while recording is there and the AVCHD format is easier to work with than I thought. I have not edited any of its video but was able to upload an unconverted clip directly to Youtube and VLC player plays back the format effortlessly.I am not an expert when it comes to judging still image quality but pictures taken seem to be very crisp and clear throughout the image in well lit environments. Pics taken in darker surroundings, to me, are not as clear as there is some degree of bluriness that occurs when zooming into the picture. Also, the flash does not seem capable of properly illuminating a dark scene when viewing your results on the camera itself. Transferring it to a PC for proper viewing yields better results but still has room for improvement.I found that the menu was a bit different to other cameras I used (ive used many but owned none before) and it took a few tries to get fully accustomed to the menu navigation but once that was out of the way, I was able to make my way around the camera very quickly and easily. The buttons are pretty well placed, however, the record button is a bit awkwardly placed and there is no way to preview video settings before starting to shoot.The included battery seems to be capable of shooting 1.5 to 2 hours of video but I bought another higher capacity battery (1200mAh) as a backup for quick changeover should the need arise.One issue I had with video recording though was that when using high quality mode, the recording would stop after a few seconds indicating that the memory card cannot keep up. I bought a 16gb Transcend class 6 memory card which sorted that problem immediately.All in all, this is a VERY good all round camera.

I was waiting to buy the new 12MP 2010 Panasonic ZS7 or the highly anticipated 10MP 2010 Sony HX5V but I just couldn't pass up a bargain. I almost went with the new Sony HX5V but the sample images on the web show the image quality to be noticeably lacking in detail compared to the ZS3. At full 100% view, the ZS3 retains detail and clarity that the new Sony just can't compete with (under lower ISO settings). I'm not waiting for the ZS7 because the sample images out there show that the extra 2MP degrades the image quality on such a small sensor, and it's gonna be $350 and up when it comes out. The ZS3's image quality is very comparable to the venerable Canon S90, you'd have to look hard to see that the S90 retains just slightly more detail.There are some slight issues which prevent me from giving it a higher score. The flash is rather weak indoors, below average. I find it has difficulty focusing in low light and has even more trouble focusing in macro mode. Some people complain about the lack of manual controls. You do get to set the ISO in certain modes but there is no way to control the shutter speed or aperture. This is no big deal as 95% of users don't understand those features. This is a really a true P&S; camera, buy something on the higher end if you want those controls or get a DSLR.I've been playing around the AVCHD video and while it's impressive for a compact camera it is definitely not a HD camcorder replacement. The CCD sensor shows streaks of vertical light in bright areas. It's useable in certain situations where you don't want to carry a camcorder. I find that the best way to deal with AVCHD is to use the free program txMuxer to combine your clips. Once it's combined into one large MTS file, you can use the free Handbrake to encode it into a high quality MP4 file that can be played on virtually any media player.", "Date": "February 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Well worth the extra $50", "Author": "DeepJoy", "ReviewID": "R2HNT9TM7D3F9Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My original budget was for a sub $200 model such as Samsung TL320 12MP Digital Camera with 5x Schneider Wide Angle Dual Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0 inch OLED Screen (Black) or a Nikon Coolpix L100 10MP Digital Camera with 15x Optical Vibration Reduction (VR) Zoom.

Canon finally came up with a competitor: the PowerShot SX200 IS.  There's a great review of this Lumix on cameralabs, and I'd highly recommend looking at it.  In general it's not a spectacular camera, but it's pretty good for a point and shoot.Some Mac users have wondered whether this camera exports OK into iLife, particularly whether iLife will work with the AVCHD format.  Yes, iPhoto imports the stills, and iMovie imports the AVCHD format fine, at least for me.  The software that comes on the disk probably isn't worth installing, except perhaps for the ArcSoft panorama software, which doesn't work as well as it should but will stitch your panoramic views into a 360 degree cylinder you can spin around inside of, visually, for a cheap thrill.I don't have much to add beyond suggesting a look at that cameralabs review, except to include the following plea in case Panasonic follows these forums to get customer feedback.  This camera has no manual controls (although you can kind of game the system by using some scene menus settings that you know will affect shutter speed in certain ways, if you want to do something like slowing the shutter speed).  It should have manual controls.  They wouldn't bother users who want everything to be automatic, since they'd be buried in the menus, but they'd be handy for people who want them.  I'm guessing it would be a minor tweak to make them available, and Canon is doing it with their new competitor.  Also, and more specifically, fix the exposure bracketing!  Exposure can be manually moved up and down to + or - 2, in increments of 1/3.  However, although the camera can manually go up or down 2, automatic exposure bracketing only goes up and down 1.  That's nuts.  It ought to go up and down 1 or 2, for people who want to try HDR processing (which admittedly would be limited because this camera doesn't shoot in RAW, but the automatic bracketing should do what the camera can do manually).

The photo quality is quite nice but never as good as my year 2003 Olympus C740 which is 3MP.As a compact camera, it produces excellent video. I used AVCHD format with Super high quality, and watch with the 52\" LCD TV. The result(my HDMI connection cable from amazon.com cost me $2.10)is more than satisfactory. The professional reviews say AVCHD format is difficult to edit. I wonder how many compact cameras/camcorders users care to spend time to edit their video. Theoretically, 16GB records continuously 2 hrs+ video in AVCHD format. Actually, it is not possible. The battery runs dry in 45 minutes. Unlike most of the camcorders, extra capacity battery can be used to prolong recording time. This is the drawback of using the ZS3 instead of camcorder.

If the budget allows, I'd purchase another one in red or blue.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good little walkaround camera, but some issues", "Author": "ubat", "ReviewID": "R3Q2PZ1029QHRI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Panasonic ZS3 as a walkaround camera for when I don't want to carry my larger dSLR camera and lenses (be it for practical and weight reasons, be it for safety). I've had it for several months and have traveled extensively with it. The ZS3 has proven to be almost the ideal camera for the purpose I chose it for. Here's why:1, The ZS3 has an amazing amount of optical zoom for a camera this compact, and is also good at the wide end. This means more versatility.2. It is discreet, allowing me to take pictures without being noticed. Particularly useful when you're photographing people.3. It is small and lightweight. I can stick it into a coat pocket or attach it to my belt loop (I bought a little neoprene case for this).4. Picture quality is good, with accurate rendering of colors, exposure and white balance. Noise levels are usually quite low.5. It does have a few resources that allow me to have more control over picture-taking, but intelligent automatic mode works very well.6. Focus is accurate, even in lower light.7. Build quality is very good (except for the mode dial, see below).8. Video mode works quite well.9. Menus are comprehensive and intuitive to use, especially if you have some digital photography experience. If not, the product manual explains everything clearly.10. It's a lot of fun to use it!On the downside, there are a few aspects I don't like much on the ZS3:1. Battery life is nothing to write home about. There is NO workaround for carrying a charged spare battery. And herein lies a big problem, since the availability and price of the original Panasonic battery (DMW-BCG10PP) are horrendous. To make it worse, Panasonic outrageously released a firmware update that prevents the camera from working with any third-party compatible battery. If you install the update -- which I didn't --, you are stuck with the original battery. Good luck finding another one...2. Focus is slow. In all fairness, I can't really complain about this, as it's par for the course in this kind of camera -- especially since it doesn't have a viewfinder, electronic or optical.3. It took me some getting used to photographing with the LCD (I'm used to a viewfinder), but I eventually got the hang of it. It's not so easy in sunlight, but the LCD does a decent job.4. The mode dial frequently gets inadvertently changed when storing the camera or removing it from its bag or my coat pocket. The dial could be a little firmer.5. Powering up times aren't the best.6. Even using a good SDHC card, the camera is a bit slow in writing the images to the card.All in all, I'm pretty satisfied with the ZS3. It's not the cheapest compact camera around, but I do think that for the resources it offers (especially the fine lens) it is a good deal. I'm not sure I'd like it as much if it were my only camera, but it's doing fine for the purpose I acquired it for.", "Date": "January 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera; Amazon Cust Service aweful!!!!!!", "Author": "DES65", "ReviewID": "R21NHR4RFLPU0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had this camera for a short time, and I'm still learning it's features.

I was very happy with the image quality, although at very high ISO the noise in the images is pretty bad. The zoom is really great for a camera this size.Immediately after a trip during winter break, the camera failed, having the \"bad lcd\" syndrome that others have described. (Actually, my wife's FZ30 had the same thing happen, but after three years of pretty hard use. We got that one fixed -- required new lens unit and new circuit board.) As soon at the ZS3 failed, I packed it up and sent it off to the Panasonic Service Center. I received the replacement refurbished unit today, just two weeks after sending the camera in. No muss, no fuss. I ended up with a silver camera instead of a blue one, but that I can stand. And they also included a very nice leather case.So I can't give the camera a top rating on construction. But I can report that the Panasonic Service Center did exactly what they said they would do, and they did it in a reasonable time frame.It's a shame that the Panasonic cameras seem prone to this kind of failure.

Again, without having played with the options (white balance, etc.) on previous cameras, I haven't done anything with the ZS3. I use Photoshop Elements v.3 on most every photo I've taken with my two previous Canon's and the ZS3, using the automatic \"lighting\" and \"color\" fixes. The Canon shots sometimes came out quite a bit zippier after the software played with them. But the ZS3 shots don't change much. Perhaps they are a tiny bit dull...or perhaps the ZS3 is getting it right the first time around and PS Elements likes what it is seeing. Sorry. I don't know \"color\" very much, but I'm very happy with what I'm getting.My optical zoom has gone from 3x with the two Canons to 12x with the ZS3. BIG difference. But I have to be extremely careful with the zoom. I depend on it too much, the end up with blurring, especially indoors. Gotta stop being a Couch Potato. Gotta get up and get closer to the subjects and not depend on the zoom to take me across the room.I'm happy with the camera. I'd buy it again.

The old one was okay but I was never able to get great pics and the optical zoom was only 3x so I decided to look for something better.  I wanted something that did not need me to make decisions so manual controls were not important.  I wanted lots of zoom and the best video capabilities for vacations and family events coming up.  And I wanted something that could fit into my purse when going on the town.  I landed on the Cannon, Samsung and Panasonic Superzooms, as cnet calls them.  I really liked what I heard about the Sony H20 but the size was just too much.  After knocking out the Cannon based on reviews and that pop up flash it has, I got the Samsung because it was cheaper than the Panasonic.  It was fine but bulky and I just didn't like it for purely unexplainable subjective reasons.  I didn't like the size and the menus didn't feel intuitive, to me.  Returned it and got the Panasonic and I love it.The size, feel, menus and features all fit what I wanted.  I have used it outside and indoors and it works well for me.  Much better than my older camera but I guess that is to be expected.  I have trouble with purples but I have been told by a photographer friend of mine that it is a very difficult color for any camera to capture.  Indoor low light isn't the best but I think that is just something to be expected with point and shoots.  Macro shots are really great.  I can really see the difference in details between this and my older camera.  I took it to a body building show and was able to zoom up close and get great shots.  The camera was quick enough to get a shot as the competitors moved through their poses.  I took about 300 shots that night and used 1 of three bars of battery energy.  I use the flash very rarely because I seem to get the best results without it.  I keep this camera in my purse and it goes everywhere i do.  i take so many more pictures now and they much better.  Mission accomplished.There is a well talked about problem with sourcing extra batteries.  I know some people find the situation to be highly irritating but I really couldn't care less.  This is not a problem for me as I have not yet depleted the battery during use (300 shots at bodybuilding show is about as much as I would use it in a day) and am close enough to electrical outlets each night to recharge if needs be.

Some of the pocket models are getting down right tiny.  This camera is a bit smaller than previous models and can be carried in a pocket easily.  It his well made and feels like a high priced camera, which it is.  The main reason I favored this camera over other models capable of taking really good pictures too is the Optical Telephoto 12x Zoom.  As with the older model the pictures taken with the zoom are unbelievable.  To really appreciate what Panasonic has done one has to be old enough to remember taking Telephoto pictures with the 35MM SLR.  Canon and Nikon are scrambling to come up with a comparable model to compete with the success of the Panasonic.  Yes, like others, I miss having the backup eye piece for those times the lighting conditions make it difficult to compose a shot with the LCD back screen.  I have an older Kodak with a through the lens eye piece and it still takes good pics but boy is it slow and it is like the SLR in size so does not slip into a coat pocket so easy.  The menu on the SZ3 Lumix is easy to use and looks great.  some menus on other cameras just look cheap -- picky, I know, but this camera is not cheap.  Battery life is really good, I have a backup battery but hardly need it.  The second battery is handy, however.  The camera comes with a Charger and it is an improvement over the older model as it is a quick charge type.  I think the flash has been improved also as it has better range than before and it is not as prone to washing our a flash picture.  Another improvement is the ability to use the zoom while filming in video.  Okay, so what don't I like?  The The software is crap.  It comes with two types of software, Media Impressions from ArcSoft which is okay but it will not play the new AVCHD video format -- you will still have HD JPEG, thank god, but the software they give you to play the new format AVCHD is junk, it does not work, and I'm not the only one to have this problem.  The title to this software is PhotoFunStudios and it is anything but fun.  Without the ability to play back the AVCHD format on you PCor Laptop you are not going to be able to do any editing, so my advice is to set you new camera on the HD JPEG format and be happy.  The Advantage of the AVCHD is it is supposed to give you HD in a smaller foot print saving you space on you little SD card -- just buy a bigger card 8GB or bigger and forget about AVCHD.  You can go online and purchase AVCHD software that works but that is another $40.  Yes, I know, Panasonic should fix this and to tell the truth had I known about this earlier I might not have bought this camera as I originally thought this new format would be a cool feature have.  So, if video is an important part of you purchase I would think twice before shelling our the big buck for the Panasonic. Here is another caveat concerns the battery.  Panasonic decided to upgrade the firmware for the camera from the original production to a version 2, which comes preloaded on the new cameras, and this version will not allow you to use a third party battery -- that's right, you are locked into paying top dollar for the LUMIX only battery, usually around $40.  You can get batteries that will work in the Panasonic camera for half that price on Amazon and even less if you go to a Hong Kong distributor.  the way around this form of holdup is to download firmware version 1.1 and reverse version 2 back.  The camera will then accept third party batteries.  From what I could tell the battery limitation was the only reason for the upgrade to version 2.  You can still get the older version originally used on this camera and all of the older models from the Panasonic web site support, but for how long?  It is a great camera and the zoom is super and the menu easy to use and the battery life really good and it is easy to handle but for the Firmware problem and software that will not function properly I would seriously check out their competitors.  If you buy, then get one at CostCo, try it and if it is not too much trouble and you don't care about the Firmware version and the video format isn't a big deal then I would say keep it, otherwise take it back to CostCo and go for the Canon or the Nikon.  Peace, to you and yours -- I hope this may have been of some help to someone looking.  I bought my camera at Amazon, they have always been fast and fair and CostCo did not have this camera in when I made my purchase.

MCCLORY", "ReviewID": "R2NISZ1M8L8LWS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Panasonic is my 3rd digital camera.  I am definitely not a camera expert, so this review is from a novice point of view.  I will be comparing this camera to my previous camera, the Canon A610.  That camera's LCD broke after 3 years, but in my mind, was a great camera.What I like about this camera.  It is well built, feels very solid in your hands.  It is not tiny, but still fits in a larger pocket.  Just the size I like.  Not too big or too small.  The LCD screen is excellent.  It is responsive and very visible in most situations.  In direct sunlight, you can't see what is displayed, but I imagine all other cameras are the same way.  And when it is particularly dark, it doesn't gain as much as I'd like, but it's good enough.  Just in case your are curious, you can still see the LCD if you use polarized sunglasses.  Unless you turn it to the vertical position.  Which if you know anything about that, it's really the best way it can be.  I guess they could make it go dark on a 45 degree angle instead, but this is good anyway.  The lens on the camera is amazing.  I can zoom all the way out or all the way in, and I don't notice any barrel distortion.The outdoor photos are amazing.  Scenery shots and scenery macro shots are crystal clear.The camera is fairly fast at focusing and taking the photos.  Not as fast as I want, but probably no point and shoot camera would be.The video is excellent.  I haven't used the AVCHD lite format, because I heard it was a pain to deal with.  All it really does is save space on the memory card.  But with how cheap memory and hard drives are, who cares about that.  The video looks good and being able to use the optical zoom while filming it great.  The sound recording is good if you are close enough, but when the target is far away, you can't really hear what is going on.What I don't like.Double flash for redeye reduction.  I always have to tell people to wait for the second flash.  But it is instinctual to blink after a flash, so a lot of the times people will have their eyes closed for the second flash.  I guess the best way to have no red-eye is to have your eyes closed :).  Also, I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old.  Most of the pictures they are looking at me strangely due to the double flash.  I prefer the Canon method of putting out the orange light and keeping it on.The color reproduction with the flash is not great.  I took several identical photos with my Canon using the flash indoors.  Then I compared the photos.  In every case, the colors looked more realistic on the Canon.  Every Panasonic shot was dull or muted compared to the Canon.Also, the low-light photos have much more noise than the Canon.  The Canon trumps the Panny in every indoor shot, flash or no flash.The intelligent auto is hit or miss on this thing.  I can take the same photo twice and get different results.  Shots in well lit situations are always good, but when you have high-contrasting shots, sometimes the camera compensates much differently than other times.  You never really know if you are going to get a good shot.When you set the camera to continuous auto-focus, you can hear it constantly trying to gain focus.  It can be annoying, and you just know it is killing the battery.Which is a good segue into my next point.  The battery life is not what I'm used to.  My Canon's 4 rechargeable AA batteries seemed to last forever.  I would take hundreds of pictures over a period of 5 months before they needed to be charged.  This camera, I got about 100 pictures.  I took about 10 minutes of video.  I played back the videos and pictures about once or twice each.  I had to charge the battery after 1 or 2 days.  Obviously I was using the camera more than my old one, but the difference was a lot.  Panny claims 300 shots, but it just doesn't seem to last that long.  I would strongly recommend a backup battery, if you can find one.  But they are $50 a pop, so consider that in the cost.I haven't tried all of the features out on the camera, but I generally don't use anything else.  I buy point and shoot cameras because I want to \"point\" and \"shoot\". I don't want to have to worry about settings and scene modes.  So maybe I'd get some better results if I messed with the different modes, but I don't know.  I'm using the camera exactly the same way as my Canon.  The Canon wins in indoor and flash situations.  The Canon is more consistent and has better battery life.  The Panasonic wins outdoors photos and for video recording.  Also, the lens is better, great range from wide angle to telephoto.All in all the Panasonic is a good camera, but not great.  I'm giving it 4 stars.  I think 3 seems to harsh.  Some people may think 4 is too harsh, but I was spoiled with my Canon.  Which was cheaper and now is a 4 year old model.  I was hoping things would get better.  Some aspects did get better, but others got worse.  And this camera is much more expensive.  So I'm not thrilled with it, like I was my Canon.The bottom line is, if you want a big zoom in a little camera (relatively) and hi-def video, I would recommend this camera.  If you can live without some of that zoom, I'd look for something else.  The Fuji F200EXR was my second choice.  After using the Panasonic, I'm thinking the Fuji may have been a better choice.  I haven't used that camera though, so I'm not sure.I hope this helps.", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worst Image Quality Ever", "Author": "Junqing Chen \"N\"", "ReviewID": "R8EF9IU3GEK7N", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am an imaging person and I know what to expect when it comes to a point and shoot camera.

Picture quality/colors were really about the same when the ZS3 was focused so the Canon gets the nod here for focusing ability. Macro pics were even. Flash is MUCH better in the Canon.

Wish I could say it was great, but....I received the Panasonic DMC-ZS3 from Amazon yesterday. I took it back to UPS to return after several hours.Good: The camera when spot on takes amazing, colorful pictures.  The zoom is great.  Macro fxn may even be better.Bad: 75% of my shots had tons of NOISE or outright out of focus-- and no, I do not have Parkinson's. I'm no professional, but even I can  see how bad the focus fxn is on this camera. I tried all different settings on this to no avail. I consider my house to be bright  (live in Phoenix) esp my living room. Still the camera fought to find the correct picture. Outside did better, but still had an  unacceptable amount of noisy pics. Also, if your subject even moves and inch, the focus is blown. I could maybe see if the pics were  taken in a darker setting, but not the case.  Not many adjustable fxns compared to others.  Flash is HORRENDOUS.....way underpowered..I could live with the flash and really with a camera that has hiccups once in a while, but the pics that this one took were totallyunacceptable. After reading all of the review before buying, I really wanted this camera to be mine-- I could deal with all of the cons except for the fact that I couldn't get a proper pic.Maybe I got a defunct camera but I'm not buying another to find out....", "Date": "September 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "very disappointed", "Author": "AW", "ReviewID": "R3R1E4B5SU4Y3U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received my brand new ZS3 from amazon a few days ago.I had a TZ5 before, liked the performance overall but couldn't bear its horrible sound quality.

I was so disappointed.1. the sound is tiny and as bad as TZ5, although I admit I can tell the \"stereo\".  I took videos on my TV with above comfortable sound volume setting, I could barely tell if there any sound recorded on ZS3.  I transferred the file to my PC and turn the volume to the highest, it was a little better but still not even close with that on my 5-year old canon S400 replayed on itself.2. i had many more out of focusing pictures on ZS3 than TZ5, especially in tele mode.3. as to the videos, TZ5 can show full LCD screen both in shooting and reviewing.  ZS3 only shows about 80% of the screen.4. low light picture quality, ZS3 sounds even more grainy.Overall rating combining performance and price, TZ5: 4.0, ZS3: 2.0.I wish the ZS3 I received is a defective one, although I really doubt it.While most of the reviews are very positive, I totally agreed with the earlier comments made by \"Fred Blogg\".

It produced wonderful pictures during that time.  This camera was treated well and kept in a case when not in use.  It was not taken to the beach where it would get sand in it or used in an abusive manner.  We used it mostly indoors for family photos.About 3 weeks ago we started having problems.  When the camera was turned on the lens would extend and retract several times and then finally close.  A warning was displayed stating \"System error (zoom).\" At first we thought it was the battery and replaced it.  The same thing happened.  Thus we called Panasonic and found out to have the camera repaired it would cost $180 through a company in Texas (no one answers the phone).  This is approximately half the cost of a new camera of the same model.Another family member, who purchased one around the same time, also started having problems with their Lumix DMC-ZS3.  First when previewing taken pictures, the lens would not retract and close but stayed open.  Additionally, when taking a picture, the lens covering would not completely open and had to be manually moved so as not to create a shadow on the picture.  As above, the cost for repair was $180.Looking online, it appears that these issues are not isolated and have frustrated many.  Paying $400 for this camera to have it basically become inoperable 2 years later is unacceptable.In contrast, we have two Canon point and shoots that we have used over the last 5 years with no problems at all.I have voiced my disappointment in an email to Panasonic.

I was told that this noise is normal and if I carefully read the warranty, I could see that Panasonic was not responsible for camera noise. But, as you can see, if you watched the video, this noise seemed extreme. So we returned it to Costco where it was originally purchased and got a new DMC-ZS3. This camera had the same problem.

I then sent a video to another owner of the same camera and he said that the noise I was experiencing was about 10x what he observed in his own videos.

She wanted a camera and was coming from a very long-in-the-tooth 4MP 3X Coolpix.  OMGoodness, what an incredible camera.  She literally has not glanced at the manual.  Immediately after opening, she was navigating the menus.  The optical stabilization cancels out any of her 12 year-old hands, the 12x zoom is fantastic, and most of all the low light pictures perform absolutely perfect.  Start of evening, a few ambient lights on, and she takes a picture of the cat w/o a flash.  Absolutely gorgeous picture.She flips to sunset mode, pet mode, sport, etc. with ease.  She was really frustrated with her old Coolpix slow first picture lag.  This one is quite fast and subsequent ones also.She hasn't used the video portion yet b/c we need to get a mini-hdmi to hdmi cable.  I don't think Amazon sells them so hopefully they will keep this in the review -- you can get the cable for pennies on the dollar from monoprice vs. the $50 Panasonic one; or get an an HDMI adapter for the price of a fast food lunch.  I think part of the success of this camera experience is that we paired it with a SanDisk 8GB Extreme III - SDHC Class 10 High Performance memory card (from Amazon!) SanDisk 8GB Extreme III - SDHC Class 10 High Performance memory card (SDSDX3-008G-P31, Retail Packaging) - NEW 30MB/s edition --  it is a little pricier (a little shy than twice as much) than the Class 6 cards, but why not get the latest technology?  I figure for fast recovery between shots, rapid fire mode, and videos cameras need all the speed they can get from a card. It is 30MB/s vs. the 20MB/s of the Class 6.  I was also worried about getting an 8MB card vs. 16MB, but after I read the capacity on the sandisk website, you can fit over 2000 10Mp pictures on a 8GB card -- OR one hour of the AVCHD Lite video ( [...]).  I figured even with a combination of the two formats, she would be fine; plus I didn't want to spend triple the price of the 16GB card over the 8GB card -- much less spending 40% again what the actual camera cost.We also paired this camera with this case (Amazon again) -- the Lowepro Rezo 30 -- it fits perfectly, has an adjustable shoulder strap, not too big, a belt or purse strap fastener, soft inside for the screen, a place for a battery, and for the price of two fast food lunches it can't be beat Lowepro Rezo 30 (Black)Six years ago I paid more than twice the price of this camera (plus a hundred dollar 512M SD card) for a 5Mp 12x camera that is three times the size and takes lousy low-light pictures, slow to recover to the next shot, and hungry for power.  If you camera is showing a little age, buy this thing now.  Don't hesitate.The sample pictures don't lie, this thing takes pictures that rival the best in any publication.

You have the manual option, but have not ventured into this yet. I read you can increase the image quality even more when properly setting the camera manually. I gave it 4 stars for ease of use, rather than 5, only because there were features that I could not intuitively figure out. I was used to the Nikon Coolpix cameras, which are very intuitive. With the Panasonic, I had to spend the time reading the manual and figuring out how to do somethings like cropping an image, using the red eye correction, choosing the movie format for computer downloads, etc. Not difficult though, just requiring the extra time. Another thing I like about the camera is that it is quite ergonomic and reasonably light. Also, the objective is protected when the camera is off so you can keep it in your purse without the fear of scratching the lens.

Krueger", "ReviewID": "R1REWJYWE44ULB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an old 35mm and 6x6cm shooter, plus did my own darkroom work years ago.  In 2002 I entered the digital age and purchased an Olympus C2020?, then last year a Canon A570.  The Olympus gave very good images, however, the Canon has become my favorite 'carry everywhere' camera due to it's small size, many features and relatively low cost.  However, I have never been completely happy with the image quality of the Canon and feel the old Olympus yielded better images.My youngest son was married in October and I wanted to do a video of the wedding, as his grandmother was unable to attend.  The video capabilities of the Canon are resolution limited so I decided to look for a camera with HD capability.  I also decided a camera with flash memory would be the most rugged and after some searching found that the Lumix DMC-ZS3 has 720P HD video capability and well as full zoom capability in video mode (this is the only regular digital camera in this price range to offer full zoom capability in the video mode).Many regular flash memory video cameras have a file size limit in HD mode (2GB).  This limits recordings to less than 15 minutes.  To continue recording one must then start another file.  Not so with the Lumix.  Using AVCHDlite recording mode allows uninterrupted video recording (until the SD card is full).  So a 16GB card yields 2hours of continuous 720P HD recording using the AVCHD lite mode.  The latest version of iMovie (Mac app) can read AVCHDlite files so I'm in business.The Lumix does an excellent job with video, yielding superb images (even from the back of a large church) and stereo sound.  Plus the still images are absolutely superb!  Over the last several weeks I have taken quite a few available light shots with the Lumix and the images are noticeably sharper than most other digital images that I've seen.  Plus the color balance is excellent.  I'm guessing that this is primarily a function of the Leica optics and the image processing algorithms.My only negative is the lack of a viewfinder.  I find a viewfinder necessary for fast framing.

It is, without reservation, the most superb all-round camera I have ever owned and turned out to be an excellent purchasing decision.Gone are the days when the only way you could get really sharp high-quality photos was to use a big SLR with changeable lenses requiring a shoulder bag to lug it all around. The near-perfect little ZS3 fits into any pocket - even a trouser pocket, and it's so slim and lightweight you barely notice it.The LCD is the best I've ever used - even better than a comparable Sony Cybershot. It `s a full  three inches across and brightens/dims according to available ambient light, a thoughtful feature presumably to ensure conservation of battery power.The LEICA-originated lens produces pictures which are razor-sharp and crystal-clear. The \"Intelligent Autofocus\" setting is superb, and yields first-class results even in poor light conditions. Even a beginner, nervous of adjusting F-stops or shutter speed, can use the camera in standard mode and adjust minor features like the ISO setting or white balance, or use macro for close-ups on small objects. The video feature is particularly impressive, with both picture and sound quality way above what you might be entitled to expect from a camera costing below $400.You might think about buying a 4GB SDHC card for permanent use in the camera which, though a bit pricey, will give you all the memory capacity you ever need - and you only need to buy it once.As some other reviewers have pointed out, the battery Panasonic have chosen for the ZS3 is non-standard, so basically any spare zoom-compact batteries you may have in the drawer will be redundant if you buy this camera. The batt-life is good though, and will last several days of fairly liberal camera use, certainly up to 300+ photos. The loose mode-dial fault reported in early units has not been a problem with my camera, so I can only presume Panasonic have fixed this issue or I've been lucky.Overall, I love it. It's the best walkabout, point-and-shoot camera I've ever used and does just about everything anyone could need, with an ease of operation and superb results you will be hard-pressed to find in any rival.

We took it to Disney World for Spring Break '10 and loved the pictures. The battery life was amazing compared to any other point and shoot I've seen. Pictures are really sharp. We've used many of the different settings. It also takes unbelievable macro pics and you can get within a few inches of an object if you use the iA setting (on the dial). We also took many videos and were very impressed with the high def quality and the one-button start for the video. We used a 8MB class 4 SD card and still had room on the card after all week taking 637 pictures (998MB) and 23 videos (758MB). We only charged the battery once that week. It's a little hard to hold the camera steady when you zoom all the way in (12x) but that is to be expected. The higher the zoom, the more steady you will need to hold a point and shoot camera. Watch for the out-of-the-box settings of 10MB per pic. Most people don't need that and it'll fill up your card quick. I'd recommend changing that setting unless that's REALLY what you want. As all point and shoot cameras today, you'll need to use a tripod if you intend to use fireworks settings or similar. But the lens on this camera (Leica) is very high quality - very sharp and crisp.

My old Canon sureshot was great, but I wanted a larger zoom and a smaller size. After much research, I opted for this one over a similar canon SX200is. I got the camera (shipped) for under $250, and I'm still amazed at what it can do, at how well it does everything, and that it does it all in such a small package. Being new with the camera, I mainly used the intelligent auto function, and it worked very well, allowing me to take clear shots at full zoom without a tripod (all from a safari jeep).  I also shot some short HD films, which were pretty jittery (because of me, the jeep, and the amount of zoom) but amazingly sharp with passable sound. Keep in mind that your ability to take a fluid video will depend on the speed of your camera card (I used budget cards claiming class 8 and 10, and had good results overall, but there where a few pauses here and there probably due to write speed). While not the smallest camera you can get, I kept this camera in a shirt pocket often, which is amazing considering that it has a lens set up that goes from 28-300ish mm. Also, now that I'm not in Africa, I'm so glad it has the wide angle lens, which is what most of us need most often. It does eat batteries when under heavy use (but not so much when used sporadically) so I carefully researched and bought two extra after-market batteries for under $20 each (be careful to read reviews to see if you are getting the right battery) and both worked fine. I ended up using only two batteries per day on safari, but it was nice to know the third was there given the gravity of the trip. Oddly, the price of this camera has gone up and I think it is being replaced by a 12 megapixel model.

The camera's auto-focus tracking was excellent and the pictures are very crisp, clear and colorful.  I was most impressed on the safari ride in Animal Kingdom where I as able to capture the animals very close-up all while riding in a vehicle bumping along the path - I was never able to do that with my Sony PS200 (which I had always been very happy with).The LCD is crystal clear and very large which is great for seeing what you're getting.  It is a little difficult to see in the bright sun, but that must just go with the territory.The one downside is that the battery life does not seem to be nearly as long as with my old Sony (it could go for days on a charge).

What can you say - it zooms.....The video capability is what led me to purchase the DMC-ZS3.  It has image stabalizer which is a must.  The recording options are JPEG-movie (.MOV) and AVCHD Lite (which I have not yet found use for).I had bought the Flip HD prior to this purchase.  I returned it due to lack of image stabalization and lack of any adjustment features.  I  did like its video recording format of MP4 though.  This allows playing and editing with Microsoft programs Movie Editor and Win Media Player.  You're pretty much stuck with QuickTime for this Panasonic camera unless you are willing to part with more bucks $$ to buy video software.The weight and size are on the large size, not too condusive to sliding into your jeans pocket.  But as a 'all in one' camera to take on vacation, it is a good choice.  Especially if you intend to be on an overlook and want to zoom down into the subject city or shoreline.One disappoint so far is the price of an extra battery.

I made a huge mistake of buying a different brand, which I quickly found could only take half decent pictures outside in good daylight, and was impossible to use in low light environments.I read all of the great reviews here and bought the Lumix ZS3, I am really glad I did!  I am a basic user, I like taking pictures of things going on around me, I don't want to be fiddling with the controls while the situation disappears.  This is certainly the camera for that, unlike many other brands, you can hit the on switch and straight away the Lumix is ready to go, the automatic settings are flawless, and I've yet to get a picture which is of not excellent quality.  The optical image stabilization function works extremely well, especially for those of us who don't have the steadiest of hands.  I also bought a 8GB Sdhc card separately, and according the manual I can take well over 1000 pictures at 10MP with this.The only thing I have not tried out is the HD video function, as it doesn't come with the specific HDMI cable, and must be ordered separately.  It does however come with an old school AV cable so you can watch your videos on TV in SD, until your new cable arrives.  The battery charger is well thought out, you can leave it sitting in the electrical wall socket, and push your battery in/out whenever you need to, without having to unplug it.I highly recommend the ZS3 to the average user who wants to take high quality pictures quickly, while the camera does a flawless job of taking care of all the adjustments for you.When this camera gets outdated, I'll be looking to buy another Lumix.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Really nice small camera", "Author": "Maud Wiley", "ReviewID": "RH5KGK0J1D4A4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera and found it very easy to operate.It is my first Panasonic.

I haven't tried to capture fast motion, but the normal movements of pets are stopped without blur.  The indoor, low light photos do show some yellowing but no better or worse than other digitals we've owned.  For the most part I have left the camera in auto-intelligence mode (where it automatically picks the settings) and let it do it's thing, but last night I did override and set it to \"sunset\" for the best sunset photos I have ever taken.

I took a regular shot of Luna Park across the harbor and then I took a zoom shot.  It was like you were standing right in front of the park.  The battery life is great if you are just taking pics and not using the video.  If you use the video just make sure you bring the battery charger (for overnight) and make sure you use a card with more space (videos take up a lot more space).

We (I and my daughter) tried all the solutions listed on websites including HandBrake and talked to Apple geeks in the store, and tooled around till it was not worth our time. I was finding that the captured video was starting to get locked inside Panasonic PhotoFunStudio even on my Vista laptop. It never made it to iMovie on our Mac. As the box says, it is iPhoto compatible, and just barely.original review:I have owned this camera for a few weeks and have many positive and negative aspects of it to share with others considering this.Pros- 12x optical zoom on video and stills makes for a lot of sins, easily a steal at this price and form factor- The image stabilization is good- It is an excellent combination of features for the price if you can live with/get around the cons below- HD video (even if it is \"Lite\") and HDMI connection to TV are good thingsCons- slightly dim (easily fixed through light fill in photo editing software) indoor pictures- AVCHD \"LITE\" confuses software on PC and Mac alike. On the PC using the FunStudio, I had to instruct it to play video at normal speed before the choppy (2 fps) playback went away using one of the preferences menus in th software. On the Macbook Pro my daughter has tried both iMovie and Handbrake. iMovie import played the video too fast and she is still trying to figure out how to use Handbrake to get around this. Any help much appreciated!- So to get around it we have switched the camera to record in the format its manual suggests as the PC-friendly one\" Motion JPEG. The cards fill up too quickly and the videos (even short ones) take too long to acquire and then the .MOV files end up in the photo folder rather than the video folder.

(Amazon handled the return no problem.)  The audio on the ZS3 is awesome and the low-light performance is improved.  I have been researching compact point and shoot cameras for a while now and eagerly awaited the arrival of this model.  Purists insist that video cameras are the only way to shoot decent video, but I find that hybrid P&S; cameras are less intimidating to subjects so people tend to behave more naturally than when I whip out a dedicated videocam.  Plus, it is easy to carry.  I compile a lot of movies on my Mac for east coast  friends and family to commemorate their visits to our California home and the ZS3 is easy to work with.  I can shoot (and archive) in AVCHD lite mode and  Imovie 09 (Mac) can import the video directly from the memory card, although it has to convert the footage to a different format it can edit.  The camera also shoots in JPEG mode for those whose editing software can't process AVCHD lite.  I was very happy with the quality of video I shot with my Sony subcompact, but the proprietary Sony memory card and incompatibility with Mac software without converting the footage on my PC (to retain the audio)  were deal killers when it came to upgrading the Sony with an HD video model.  The camera has a lot more features than I even care to understand, but I like the fact that you can switch to video mode with the touch of an easily accessible button.  MY MAIN COMPLAINT about the ZS3 is that it takes a few seconds for the movie mode to engage after pressing the record button, and I have had to learn to wait for the indicator on the LCD screen to tell me I am in record mode before shooting.  When I reviewed my footage the first few times I realized I hadn't been recording sometimes when I thought I was and was sometimes recording when I thought I wasn't.  Very frustrating.  The camera should be quicker to respond when switching modes.  The Lumix also has proprietary batteries, which is expensive.  I gave up trying to order an AC adaptor, since I couldn't find a vendor, including Panasonic's own website, where I could buy the expensive 2 piece (sold separately) adaptor.  Fortunately, since my Mac was able to read the memory card directly through IMovie 09 (NOT IMovie HD) I didn't have to worry about burning up battery power uploading the video from the camera itself.  The battery life is decent BUT BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN ORDERING EXTRA BATTERIES.  I ordered the wrong ones from Amazon the first time, because the description of what Panasonic cameras these NON-COMPATIBLE Panasonic batteries (DMW-BCF10) fit was misleading in the description.  I returned these two I ordered directly from Amazon with no problem, but had to get the correct ones from another vendor (but through Amazon) and pay a little shipping (I am a Prime member).  Unlike many of the reviewers I did get the correct battery the second time , but that company, inspiretech, does not seem to be selling these batteries through Amazon now.  The  CORRECT BATTERY, the DMW-BCG10PP, is now listed as available through Amazon by Vortex Cable.  Presumably Amazon switched vendors for better reliability.  Way to be responsive, Amazon!Pros:  Picture/video quality, audio quality, uses standard SD/SDHC memory cards, compatibility/ease of use with Mac, size, 12X zoom, size, decent battery life, two modes to shoot HD video, wide-angle Leica lens, facial recognition, image stabilizationCons:  Slow to switch from picture to movie mode, some accessories hard to find, proprietary battery", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Z.

I bought a standard SDHC Memory Card that writes at 2 MB/sec (Class 2), whereas for the HD movie to record you need a least a Class 4 Card, or, better yet, a Class 6 SDHC Memory Card.

Older versions of Adobe Photoshop Elements are fine for photo editing.ORIGINAL REVIEW June 24, 2009DMC-ZS3 COMPARED TO OTHER CAMERASLike many people on this site, I read alot of reviews.  The major competitors in the compact superzoom category are Canon SX200, Olympus 9000, Panasonic DMC-ZS1, DMC-ZS3, Samsung HZ10W and Sony DSC-H20.  The most helpful review I found was from the DPREVIEW website:  dpreview com / reviews / q209grouplongzoomMANUAL CONTROLSNone on DMC-ZS3, but various web reviews indicate manual controls not critical on compact cameras:- Aperture Control: Compact sensor chips are too small for significant Depth Of Field adjustments (which can make subjects \"pop\" from background on dSLR's with larger sensors).- Shutter Control:  Might have been useful.My pictures are mostly of our young children (be fast or miss the shot).  The Intelligent Auto mode on the DMC-ZS3 makes good decisions in a fraction of the time I need.  The lack of manual camera settings has not been a problem.VIDEOThe video is the reason I purchased this camera over competing models.The 720p AVC HD video is amazing, the audio is good.Recommend downloading a free copy of Splash Lite (Mirillis website)for playback of \".m2ts\" videos.Splash video player uses only 0 to 5% of my computer CPU, vs 25 to 50% for Photofun Studio HD player.COMPARED TO PREVIOUS EQUIPMENT- My last digital photo camera was a Canon S50 (purchased 2003/deceased 2009).- My last camcorder was a Sony TRV-17 miniDV (purchased 2001/still functioning).The DMC-ZS3 is a definite upgrade (better quality results) over the older products listed above.I (thankfully) no longer drag the Sony TRV-17 camcorder to family events.WISH LISTAdd RAW capability to next firmware release.Add optical viewfinder to next generation replacement.Forget adding more Megapixels to the next generation replacement(10 megapixels is plenty).Add a larger sensor (ie from the DMC-LX3) to the DMC-ZS3 body to improve the low light capability.", "Date": "June 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Be aware of Panasonic's Warranty Terms!", "Author": "Rumpelstiltskin", "ReviewID": "R1RIG5WT0P90OB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Lumix DMC-ZS3 is a point and shoot camera (no manual controls) which performs very well and produces a very good picture quality in good light while it is working. The low light performance is less impressive, pictures appear to be a bit grainy. Overall, I liked the camera.The LCD of my red Lumix failed after six weeks and I then experienced the poor quality of their customer support. They promised to send me a new camera. Instead they shipped a refurbished one (the sticker on it said 90 days warranty and that tells you in how far they stand behind their product) in black. It had escaped their quality control (if existing) that this camera looked more like a ZS1 than a ZS3 as the AVCHDlite HD letters on the front were missing. The accompanying letter, however, stated that it had been \"refurbished to exact factory specifications\". I contacted customer support again and was told that under their warranty terms I could claim a refurbished camera only. They would check, however, the availability of a different color. Later I was told to return the refurbished camera, they would send a new one. This \"new\" camera had the correct color and came in the original box. The box, however, showed signs of extended use and the enclosed invoice stated that the camera was \"factory reconditioned\". The firmware version  was outdated. Would you trust their oral statement that this camera was brand new? However, what else could I claim for a 6 weeks old camera under their warranty terms?If you decide to buy the DMC-ZS3 you are lucky if it fails during the first four weeks of use because you then can return it without problems to most stores.

Sure the Panasonic takes sharp pictures and nice HD videos with stereo sound, but overall the still images to me are not good.

To make a long story short, I'm sending this back to Amazon because my SD800 does a better job in two key areas.1) focus. If you are taking pictures with this camera of kids be prepared to be disappointed. THe autofocus is awful and by the time it finally does focus, you've lost the shot. I'm talking a good 2-3 seconds before the camera focuses and another second to snap the picture. It's really depressing.2) The flash. If you're using this indoors, you have to use the flash (I expect this to be true of any P&S;). The flash on this is so strong, it washes out any contrast in the faces you're taking pictures of.

I have a Canon PowerShot A610 and at only 5MP it takes better pictures in low light conditions.  I don't mean candle-light, I mean just about any indoor or slightly dim setting.  Granted, my old A610 doesn't zoom as far or take HD video, but I'd gladly have traded the super-zoom for a larger CCD so that I could have a pocket camera that took nice pictures and HD video, but wasn't microchip-sized with an over-zealous zoom. (Indeed, though, Leica can make a fantastic lense!  Over-fantastic for this camera, sadly.)I've never before written reviews on my purchases, (new year's resolution to write more, perhaps?), but this camera overly underimpressed me.  Indeed, the HD movies are pretty impressive, and with great stereo sound, to boot!, and in the right lighting and set to the right setting, it can take very nice pictures.  Nevertheless.  The dozens of scene modes are slow to sift through and don't always give the best picture for the setting (I took a picture of some candles in various scene modes, and no, not \"night\" nor \"starry sky\" nor any of the other appropriate scene modes worked best; rather, the \"underwater\" scene was the best fit for that candle shot!  If only I was able to set ISO, aperture, and shutter myself...).  Not much exists, out there, that is very satisfying in this way; I've begun to look at DSLRs and now the new micro-4/3 cameras just to get the bigger CCD, though it's harder to find something that takes nice HD video with stereo sound.  So you can see that I'm not really the best candidate for this camera (or to review this camera).  But I didn't realize how bad the problem would be until I started taking pictures with the camera.  Ug, the noise is bad at nearly all ISO levels.  :(However, Amazon is really pretty fantastic.  My zero-trouble return completed without a hitch.

First of all the ZS3 has advantages on portability, and its ability to zoom while recording video. But that's about it!  Images are blurry when you zoom in to take shots; the video is more like SD quality, other than HD 720P; pictures are very grainy and noisy in night shootings. In my view the Canon SX200i delivers better image and video quality; it doesn't get as much noise as the ZS3.

Whatever other camera(s) you own, this is the one you can take everywhere.And while the 65x zoom available with combined optical/digital doesn't produce pictures that you'd want to show anywhere, it's certainly fun for spying on people. I was even able to see people at the top of the Empire State building taken from the street, 10 blocks away.Polarized sunglasses can make the screen disappear in bright sunshine. (Do wish this camera had a viewfinder.)27 scene modes cover most conditions, but they're on 2 separate screens, and the first has modes such as \"baby\" and \"pet\" (which I don't need) while \"burst\" and \"flash burst\" are on the second screen Wish one could move them around.Tried flash burst in a pretty dark room and didn't work very well, pictures were much darker than with normal flash, though the camera's flash refreshes fairly quickly so you can take a series of pictures with full flash almost as fast as in burst mode. Didn't try burst flash in a room with some lights on, yet. One of my reasons for wanting this camera is to be able to take candid pictures in a party situation and my old Sony H-5 just takes too long and I'd miss more pictures than I'd get.I'll add to this review after I use the camera a bit more.UPDATE: I've had the camera for about a month now and just returned from a weekend in Wash DC. The weather was gorgeous, not a cloud in the sky, and that was the problem. Without a viewfinder, I ended up taking lots of shots just guessing because I couldn't see the screen because of the glare. You want to take pictures with the sun behind you, lighting up the subject of your shot, but that means the sun is shining onto the screen, thus making it almost useless. It actually turns into a mirror. If you focus, you can barely see through the picture of your own face and see a dim outline of what you're shooting and hope for the best. This is not really acceptable. Otherwise the camera is great. The wide angle allows you to get shots that would be impossible (the whole dome of the capitol from underneath it) and the 12 x zoom is great and the HD movies are great, but taking pix in sunlight is what everyone needs to do. I did not try making the screen brighter, and I will play around with this next time I'm in sun and not with family, but the glare off the screen was so bad that I can't see that making a difference. I have a protective shield on the screen. Maybe they make one that acts as \"sunglasses.\" I'll have to check. I don't know why Panasonic chose not to put an EVF but this was a major blunder and while there aren't a lot of point and shoots with 12 x zooms to choose from out there, you might want to wait for one that has an EVF.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "really liked this camera", "Author": "the ghost of me", "ReviewID": "R3FI6TZT3H2UON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera mainly for the HD video part and came away happy with the picture quality too.

I also have Samsung SL720 (12.2MP, 5X zoom, HD video) purchased from Amazon couple of months ago. I was not very happy with the sharpness of indoor images of SL720 though other qualities were pretty good. So I was looking for a better alternative with better image quality, higher zoom. I did couple of weeks of research and it came down to Samsung HZ15W and this Lumix DMC-ZS3. It was hard to decide with good reviews of both, but I finally decided to give this Lumix a try.The first thing I noticed on Lumix ZS3 is its high quality LCD screen and intuitive menu/display info system. The still shot image qualities are very sharp as I expected from reviews. The image stabilization seems to work very well too. It has a lot of auto-focus modes to choose from. In the iA mode, it's fixed to face detection mode or 11-points mode. In the normal mode, it offers a lot of AF modes and I found that cetral 1 point high speed mode with continuous pre-focus mode on gives me pretty fast and accurate AF performance. So that's what I like to use in AF setting. The iA mode is fully automatic with very little things to adjust in the menu setting. But I wish it offers more options in the image resolution size, aspect ratio and quality. In the iA mode, the image quality is fixed to \"super high\" (large files) and the choice of image resolution is limited to only 10M, 5M in 4:3 aspect ratio. In the normal mode, it offers a lot more options in the resolution and aspect ratio.Now here are some disappointing performances of ZS3 to me. First, the color of indoor images with flash looks somewhat weird, not so realistic. It seems to add too much pink or purple color to the background. I played with ISO, WB settings in the normal mode to try to avoid it, but I couldn't prevent those weird color from the indoor images. Samsung cameras are making a lot more realistic, natural looking colors for indoors shots with flash compared to this Lumix ZS3. If I turn off the flash, the indoor color gets more realistic, but still not as good as SL720 with flash off. Outdoor shots look fine in the color quality. Another minor indoor issue is that the image brightness seems to fall off quite rapidly toward the edges. Also the indoor images look somewhat darker than SL720 in general. The image sharpness is a little better than SL720 in general, but the high ISO noise is not so different when I took closer look at magnified large pictures.The HD video feature is another one that I had high expectation on this camera too. I can play AVCHD files in VLC media player or Cyberlink's powerdirect video edit software, so it's none issue to me. The initial testing result looked good to me. But I noticed the size of AVCHD files even with the middle quality setting \"H\" (\"SH\" is the highest) is about 33% larger than MP4 HD files from SL720. I wish it's a little smaller in file size. The color and brightness issues I mentioned above for still images don't seem to be here in videos. It looks more accurate and well balanced than still images. However, I recently noticed some glitches in the recent videos played back. Sometimes the color noise in some area near the edge of screen pops up like flashing and quickly disappears. In some video clips it keeps happening multiple times, especially when I move the pointing direction to follow moving person or object. This is very annoying glitch and I am not sure if this is the issue with this particular used product or common one with ZS3.I really wanted to like this ZS3, but I can't get over those two issues (inaccurate indoor color, video noise patch popping up). It's otherwise very good compact high zoom camera. Next time around, I would probably look for Samsung HZ30W.Update (04/06/10): I played with AVCHD files more in other softwares and also on the Youtube. It seems to me that VLC media player is causing the weird color noise flashing from time to time. Cyberlink powerdirector and Youtube play it back much better, smoothly. Powerdirector still shows slight color noise, but better than VLC player. So this is probably due to software codec issue or something like that. Overall MP4 files have better supports and compatibility, I think.Update (04/08/10): After some more testing for indoor shots, it seems clear to me that flash lamp is ruining the color of background objects. It's not exactly white, but a bit more like light blue. Also the camera is trying to keep ISO as small as possible close to 100 when it's using flash and ISO is set to auto or intelligent. You can't change that behavior in iA mode. So I tried indoor shots with ISO set to 200, 400 in normal mode, and it greatly improved the accuracy of background colors. I wonder what others are experiencing with indoor shots with flash.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "AWESOME CAMERA,But...with a great pitfall", "Author": "hprechtb \"hprechtb\"", "ReviewID": "R3DGIUXZAGZUW3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For decades I've been trying different Cameras, and Digital ones I have had a few.

Ever time I have to start that accursed software I just lose heart and I just wonder why Panasonic is such a complete dud at creating the photo handling software. It's just a complete frustrating mess.The main purpose of the software seems to be to give you lots of warnings about not daring to touch any photos on the camera without using the software or you will not be able to access them again - you've lost them! That's true because I did in frustration move some photos in the usual drop and drag way and I lost access to the whole memory card and had to reformat - that's what they tell you so it's true.But who the heck are Panasonic and what past age are they living in to tell you that you cannot access any of your own digital property without using their mind-draining software. It's totally beyond me, yet noone in the reviews seems to mind???For example, you want to transfer the pictures taken since you last painfully started their software? Go jump, no such function, best you can do is try to remember what you transfered last time and then untick everything and then tick one by one the new photos. You want to tick the first in the series to be transfered and then the last, the usual \"shift-click\" - sorry it doesn't do that. Work your way through one by one click by click you sucker. You want to play their video? Yes it's great HD but their own formatAs for the people saying how great it was to upload to Youtube and Facebook I am stunned. How does that work - the Youtube uploaded has failed every time at the END of every upload I have tried to make. The format is not recognized by Youtube to be uploaded directly. The sizes are too big for Facebook. And the software warns you at every step that if you touch a file or change a name of anything in any movie folder then you will lose the lot. Is that what you want to risk of all your vids of your newborn child????This Panasonic crowd are locked into a prehistoric mindset of locking you into their formats and software, and woo will befall you if you attempt to use your normal IT skills to access and edit your own digital content, stills or videos. I find it appalling and as I said enough to almost certainly ensure I never buy another of their products.

I like to think of myself as an amateur photographer as I have a decent eye for a good photograph. I like to have a powerful but smallish camera at hand if I come across something decent to photograph as I don't like carrying a bulky camera and all the necessary equipment around like a professional photographer all the time. When I came across this camera I thought that it would solve all my problems; I was right and wrong.The camera is very good when there's a lot of light to shoot with. The outdoor photographs are absolutely amazing. The wide angle lens helps capture bigger areas when shooting scenery. The colors are natural and the camera captures all the details perfectly. The HD Movie mode is brilliant. I was very impressed with the clear and crisp picture quality both indoors and outdoors when making HD Movie clips. I also like the fact that there's a separate button to record movie clips. Surprisingly, the camera is not bulky as expected for one with a 12x zoom. Even if it feels a little large at first, you will get comfortable with it as time goes by. I have largish hands so the camera doesn't feel too big for me and it fits in my jeans pocket or a jacket pocket without much discomfort. However, I'm 6\"1' and I wear comfortable loose jeans. My wife, on the other hand, is petite and it will NOT fit in her jeans pocket or jacket pocket. Its more of a carry-in-your-bag kind of camera for a smaller person.I am not happy with the cameras zooming capabilities as it is not as powerful as I expected it to be. I expected to get much closer to my subjects with the 12x zoom, but it feels more like a 3x or 5x instead. I was absolutely disappointed with the indoor and night time photos. Every photograph I took turned out blurry or grainy unless the there was absolutely no movement of the camera at the time of shooting. I couldn't figure out the reason for all the noise till I read another review which stated that the camera takes bad indoor and night time photos when its on iA mode. It said that indoor and night time photos should be taken in another mode other than iA. I have yet to try this out. The battery life was a big disappointment too. I could only take about 200 - 250 photo's on a full charge which is nowhere as close the amount of photos I take on a day trip. I ended up ordering a spare battery and a car charger just to be on the safe side.PROS:- Good outdoor photos, brilliant colors.- Superb HD Movie quality.- Wide angle lens captures bigger scenes.- Good sized camera, not too heavy.- iA mode is useful when shooting outdoors.- Easy to use controls.CONS:- Bad photo quality indoors and at night.- 12x zoom is a disappointment.- Poor battery life.- A smaller person may feel that the camera is too bulky.- High priced.CONCLUSION:This camera is neither here nor there; meaning that it does not do the job of being a compact point and shoot camera OR being a camera with good zooming capabilities well enough for the money you spend on it. It's better to go for a cheap point and shoot to take around as your \"just-in-case\" camera and invest in a more expensive camera with better zooming capabilities for outdoor photography.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "The worst purchase I have EVER made.", "Author": "Lara J.

It took them FOUR MONTHS to replace my camera with a refurbished unit after a series of unbelievable mistakes and mis-communications on their part.

I set up on tripods both the Lumix and a Fuji Finepix fd100.The sound on the Lumix was good, but it completely washed out my daughter's face and dress during the hour of different scenes.  There were only a couple of minutes when she didn't appear completely washed out with bright light (such that we couldn't recognize her features).While shooting with the Lumix, I noticed that the face recognition seemed to be tracking my daughter, so it wasn't an issue of failing to focus on her.The video was so bad that it was unusable and embarrassing.  Maybe she can listen to the soundtrack.By contrast, the Finepix had little trouble with exposure, thoughout the hour performance. The reason I took the Finepix was that a week before, I had tried to video (with the Lumix) a younger daughter playing the piano in a relatively bright (daylight) living room.  The result was bright and harsh purple-tinted flashing.I also took a series of photos in the living room, some with soft light and some with bright light.  Many of the Lumix shots were over exposed (if in bright light) or grainy (if not).  The Finepix took a number of great shots (when I reviewed these later in Picasa I thought they were shot with my DSLR).I tried some outdoor shots with the Lumix--they were ok, somewhat soft with a tendency to overexpose.  I found indoor shots to be quite grainy and flash photo shots to be generally harsh and overexposed.I tend to judge a camera after the fact when I review the shots and decide which ones to keep.  I delete many.  With my Pentax DSLR and 50 mm 1.4 lens, I tend to keep more.  With my Finepix, I keep a fairly large number.  With the Lumix, I just haven't been impressed.

I'm 60 and did not want to have to figure out all the various manual controls needed for a perfect shot.  I just wanted a decent photo most of the time and video capability.  I was initially attracted to the Nikon CoolPix series, then the Canon SX-200, and once again Sony, but as I read review after review, I kept seeing the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 as the benchmark the rest were measured against.  I didn't even know Panasonic made digital cameras, and considered the brand to not be top of the line.  However, the more research I did, the more I realized this was exactly the camera I wanted.  (The very best review I read is [...] please note there are links to more in-depth review information on it...highly recommend you read it all.)What I wanted and why I like it:-  Excellent pixel size and zoom up to 48X.-  Video capability - surprise, this one has high definition, stereo microphones, and zoom capability.-  Minimal manual settings for folks who don't want to figure it all out, yet enough for the things that I might want to do (haven't yet).-  Good battery life and quick recharge capability.-  Easy interface with HD TVs, computers, printers, etc.-  Bright LCD viewer that can be seen in the sunshine.Negatives:  None worthy of turning it down, although...truth in reporting...one flaw I saw reported in reviews was that the mode nob is more loose than most and can change itself without you knowing it...same is true for mine, but really not a big deal!  What is advertised as HD video isn't quite broadcast standard, but I have to agree it is much, much better than the video I had with my older Sony point-and-shoot.  Panasonic also has a newer ACHD format that minimizes video file size, and as noted in various reviews, those files go to a more remote, hard to find location on the memory card, but it really wasn't that hard to find, not really an issue at all.I've put it through lots of tests, touring Hawaii's Kiluea Volcano and National Park two days after receiving it, and now with a new puppy, capturing its  perpetual high-speed motion playing with our older pup, in both HD video and still photos.  As a point-and-shoot, it does really darn well.The only hiccup I've noticed was an attempted quick spin-up to capture the puppy learning to climb steps in video.  I started to record before the camera was ready to go (as soon as it turned on) and it stopped with the warnning something like \"speed too fast to write to memory,\" then \"writing to memory,\" but it froze there.  I couldn't shut down with the off switch, so I removed the battery, which was essentially a re-boot, and it has worked like a champ since. I believe the max spin up time is closer to 5 seconds, and I'll just have to be more patient.Summing up, although higher cost than most, it's a superb digital camera and  a great value.

She doesn't like to fiddle with settings so it's automatic everything suits her style just fine.  It is a little larger than most compact cameras but she always carries around a cavernous purse in which it has no problems hiding in.  She does love the extra zoom that also works with the video as well as it having one of the best wide angle settings so she doesn't have to get up from the restaurant booth to fit everybody in the shot.

Bygrave \"Beach&Garden;\"", "ReviewID": "R5K5H5M3O2D0P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After ten years of digital photography with four different cameras, I was tired of lugging around a bag with a camera and its auxiliary lenses so I purchased a Canon PowerShot SD850 IS Elph and a Samsonite case that handily fits in my pants pocket.  The SD850 takes stunning photos that far exceed what I expected from a subcompact before I bought one; however it has three major limitations:  its lens is not wide angle; its maximum optical zoom is x4; and its manual controls are restricted.  My \"ideal\" camera would be as small as my Elph, would have a wide angle lens with x10 or greater optical zoom, automatic and full manual controls, produce quality 8x10 images at as high an ISO as possible, and have an LCD screen bright enough to be used in full sunlight.  (I seldom use flash and never use video so they are not important considerations.)Some of the latest compact ultra-zoom cameras come close to my ideal.  After extensive research, I narrowed my choice to the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 and the Canon PowerShot SX200 IS.  No doubt about it, reviews indicate that the DMC-ZS3 is the better point-and-shoot camera.  What's more it comes closer to meeting most of the specifications of my \"ideal\" camera:  the DMC-ZS3 has a 25mm. wide angle lens compared with 28mm. for the SX200; it produces slightly better pictures at ISO 400 and higher; also the DMC-ZS3 has a brighter LCD screen with twice as many pixels; and it is 0.2 in. slimmer and \u00bd oz. lighter.  Reviewers' reservations about the DMC-ZS3 include the ease with which the mode selection wheel can slip accidentally to an unwanted setting and Panasonic's mediocre image handling software.I decided to purchase a DMC-ZS3 because, even though it lacks manual controls, it is superior to the SX200 on three factors that are very important to me--wider angle lens, smaller size, and superb LCD--but before placing my order, I looked at the properties of a sample of photos taken with my Elph over the past 12 months.  Much to my surprise, many of my best shots were taken in manual mode at ISO 200; and most automatic shots of flowers, trees, and landscapes were taken with the foliage special scene setting, which is unique to Canon cameras.  It gave me second thoughts about selecting the DMC-ZS3 rather than the SX200 so I looked at even more reviews and rankings.When reading reviews, especially those of customers on vendor's Websites such as Amazon.com, it is often difficult to separate a reviewer's objectivity from subjectivity.  Perhaps the most objective appraisals and rankings are found in Consumer Reports, but it has not yet examined either the DMC-ZS3 or the SX200.  However, the July 2009 edition of Consumer Reports evaluated their immediate predecessors, the DMC-TZ5 and the SX110 IS; it ranked them equal in overall performance and awarded its coveted \"best buy\" rating to the SX110 as it was $60 cheaper than the DMC-TZ5.  Granted, the DMC-ZS3 and the SX200 have new lenses, the SX200 body is a radical new design, and both models have other improvements, but it is probably not a big leap of faith to believe that their overall performance relative to each other is similar to that of preceding models, which means they are about equal.I changed my decision and stayed with the Canon brand. The clinchers were the full manual controls of the SX200 and my familiarity with the controls and menus of Canon digital cameras and with Canon's image handling and editing software; after all, there is a steep learning curve to mastery of digital cameras and photos.  The DMC-ZS3 is the better choice for someone who is indifferent about manual controls and is willing to pay $100 (Amazon prices 6/19/09) more for a very intelligent compact point-and-shoot ultra-zoom camera that also delivers very good videos. My review of the SX200 was posted on Amazon on June 15.November 5, 2009.  The December 2009 ConsumerReports ranked the SX200IS #7 and the DMC-ZS3 #16 in its evaluation of Superzooms.  In the CR tests, the SX200IS outperformed the DMC-ZS3 on dymanic range and highest ISO for a quality image without flash (ISO400 for the IS200IS and ISO200 for the DMC-ZS3), and the IS200IS has a complete set of manual controls.", "Date": "June 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Garbage pictures and panoramas, better have a good SD card", "Author": "PainMaestro \"WinoFino\"", "ReviewID": "R12KC2BZEUV8V5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As I became dissatisfied over time with the jpeg artifacts in my images on my Canon cameras, I began looking for solid images on other point 'n' shoots.  [...] and Steves Digicam websites gave very positive reviews and showed excellent images from the Lumix ZS3.  I emailed Panasonic because of my concerns about creating panoramas and stitching images: most digitals put a limit on how many images you can take in a pano, and Canon does not.  Panasonic assured me this camera had no limits, just like Canon cameras.I'll leave it to the other reviews on the shortfalls of this camera which are many.  However, I found the build and the ergonomics to be overall pretty good compared to most such cameras at this level of capability.Here come the reasons to not buy this dog:1. Image quality: just awful.  While it balances light well and the modes for various scene settings are really quite good, what difference does that make when all the images are buried in jpeg artifacts?  Even in high lighting situations the noise is ridiculous!  Neither Steves Digicams nor the [...] websites mentioned this, and their sample images don't show it.  Either they are in the employ of Panasonic or they were sent premium versions of the camera that do not reflect the mass produced item.2. Panoramas: Limit to your pictures is about 5, then you have to start all over.  Not good if you're trying to do a 360 scene or a large montage.  Panasonic outright lied to me.

Two days later the sub-vendor indicated that the order would ship six days after order receipt. It seems unreasonable that a vendor would take that long to ship an order for a single item that is reportedly in stock.1 Oct 2010:  This camera was purchased after a great deal of research into many review sites online (sometimes it feels like there are just too many choices -- just kidding).  The camera has arrived and I've updated my ratings based on initial use of the camera for it's intended purpose -- that being as a camera for my wife who hadn't taken any photos since the Polaroid SX-70 days.  Setup was easy and aided by a very clear LCD display and step-by-step stroll through the screens with the user's manual at hand.We were both taking very good photos in short order.  I also created some short movies to test the functionality and was pleased with the results this little camera produced.  The SDHC cards need to be Class 6 for video and it took a call to Tech Support to learn that as I didn't find it in the specs nor in my reading of the manual (I later realized I had missed that information which was embedded within the text of the manual but not where I would have expected it).  Do order a SDHC card with the camera, if you don't have one, as the internal memory is minimal.This is not a Nikon F3, nor a D3x, in build quality or output.  Nor does it fall in that price range.  It is a great little \"purse\" or \"pocket\" camera for a less experienced photographer and a good quick-use camera for the more experienced when it just doesn't make sense to break out the bigger SLR.So far, I strongly recommend this camera, as I said above, for our intended purpose.

I read a gazillion reviews before purchasing and expected to be impressed. I was hoping that it would take beautiful pictures indoors and of my pets.  It did not do either of these things.  I had an issue with my previous camera with redeye indoors, and hoped with the technology in this camera that it would correct that.  It did not, and I actually had more pictures with red eye than I did before!  The pictures indoors were no better than my 3 year old cheapo Kodak EasyShare.  The zoom was nice and pictures at a distance did come in clear but it did not zoom as far as I thought a 12x zoom would.  There were several little things that bugged me about this camera, one being that I had to move a switch to go from picture mode to review mode.  My biggest complaint is the time it took to take a picture.  The delay caused me to miss shots. I kept the camera for a few days and played with the different settings, but still was not satisfied. I am sending this camera back.The button to immediately go to video mode was GREAT, and the videos I took were really good quality.  If video quality is important than this may be a good choice for you, but since I already have a really nice camcorder it did not factor into my choice of buying this camera.  I think this camera took high quality photos, but the advanced features and intelligent auto that I thought would help me to take great photos did not meet my expectations.  IMHO I think a cheaper camera would be just as good. The feel of the camera was nice and sturdy as well, and the screen was beautiful.", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Video capability, but photo is not impressive", "Author": "H. Wang \"jwangamazon\"", "ReviewID": "R26YP3ODI2NXA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Panasonic DMC-ZS3 (also called TZ7) is the 5th digital camera I have owned. I have been using Panasonic TZ1 for last 2.5 years and I am quite happy with TZ1 for its optical image stabilization and 10X telecope capability. However, the TZ1 is 5MP with standard Video (SD) only. So, I think it's time to upgrade.Though DMC-ZS3 has 12X power, but I think the practical maximum range is 8X-10X zoom, as the shooting object need to have clear edge for the camera to focus, when in 12X, most of time, the camera will not be able to find an edge for focus. This is a common limitation for most cameras. If the 12X is one of key reason for you to pick this camera, then  think again.I was hopping that TZ7 can have better picture-to-picture lag time. But it's still around 2 sec delay time. Kind of slow for taking kid's pictures.The DMC-ZS3 (or TZ7) has an IA mode that automatically adjusts the speed, ISO...,etc for you. In outdoor, well-light conditions, this IA mode is good. However, when shooting indoor, the IA mode tends to pick up ISO above 400. And you will be very very disappointed with the photos taken with ISO >= 400 by this camera, as the photos show very significant noise. My recommendation: stay away from the IA mode for all indoor shootings. Also, the flash light is on the weak side. So, stay closer to your object if you plan to use flash for indoor shooting. Overall, comparing with my old TZ1, I don't see better photo quality taken by DMC-ZS3 (or TZ1), especially for the indoor pictures.DMC-SZ3 has good video capability, you can zoom while taking video (same as TZ1), it also records stereo audio. It supports both standard video (SD) and AVCHD-lite (or 1280x720 HD). Quite some softwares can handle AVCHD editing, like AVS video editor, Corel VideoStudio Pro X2, Cyberlink PowerDVD Director Ultra 8, Nero 9..., etc. Window media player 12 (free) can play AVCHD video clips on you PC also. The AVCHD video clips from the camera can be uploaded into YouTube directly. That makes the video sharing captured by this camera more easier.You should use the IA mode when taking video in any low-light condition, the camera automatically adjusts the ISO sensitive, shutter speed to accomodate the low-light environment. Due to low-light, the video will be somewhat grainy (quite common for consumer level cameras or camcorders), but acceptable (remember, this is a camera, not a camcorder). In outdoor, well light conditons, it produces satisfactory video clips.In video taking mode, the camera will recognize face and try to focus on the face. However, if taking scenery video without clear objects (or edges) for the camera to focus, the video clips do not seem to be sharp.Battery life is on the short side, so, don't forget to charge it before your trip (you won't over-charge the Li-Ion battery).Overall, I like the 1280x720 AVCHD video function and the wide/telo zoom capability, but the photo quality is not very impressive (especially the indoor photos).

For about $60 more (than you would spend on a Kodak or Flip) you get a Full HD camcorder, a *fantastic* point and shoot and REAL lenses - which, by the way, has a 12x OPTICAL zoom.My only 2 complaints would be (A:) the lack of a power cable to charge its battery directly, and (B:) the battery life - way too short compared to my old and reliable Sony P200. A firmware upgrade Panasonic done on this camera rendered useless ALL the compatible (grey market) batteries out there. So you can only turn to Panasonic's original (and quite expensive) battery. Such a shame.The pros, on the other hand, outweights by a large amount these 2 negative points. Please, read on.Its autofocus is simply magic.I got a small kid, which stands still for about 1/2 second. Anyone with small kids knows what I'm talking about. This ZS3 uses that split second to get a hold on the subject and follows around the fugitive kid - correcting the focus! So you can press the shutter button whenever you want: most pictures will come out just crystaline.And it also got face recognition.Not quite smart- sometimes it's not able to recognize a already registered face - but impressive when it gets right.You can register 5 faces on the ZS3.About the camcorder use.The files generated when filming with the ZS3 is something alien (in a very complex file-folder structure) which I can only access (read and write in a different format) with iMovie '09. VLC also can read and play them, but since VLC cannot export and save, it's no good. Final Cut Pro doesn't seem to recognize the connected ZS3. I read somewhere FCP is supposed to recognize and import these video files in Log and Capture dialog window, but I wasn't able to do so.Since these videos *are* in AVCHD native format (and very compressed), passing them through Apple Compressor gives you a small file with pretty heavy artifacts. Even choosing H.264 codec. That is: the video becomes dirty and useless.The bottomline: good camera, fair pricing (not cheap), that I can recommend for anyone interested in a good portable Full HD camcorder that - eventually - is a superb point-and-shoot photographic camera.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Delmas Hall \"blue boy\"", "ReviewID": "R1XRH95L8Z0GUC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having a great time with it and saving lots of memories.

If the camera is not completely still when taking a photo at normal setting the picture is blurry.  Even with the \"optical image stabilization\" on.3.  They have a special cord to transfer photos to your computer.  The stupidest design feature is the panasonic specific cord that is necessary to connect the camera to the computer.  The cannon uses a standard USB so, even though i mis-placed the cord that came with the cannon I have about 20 other standard USB cords so I am never slowed down.  I mis placed the Lumix cord so now I have to either take out the little SD card and transfer it to the cannon to upload or use my home computer that has a reader for that chip size.  Basically their design is costing me time and eventually money cause I will need to buy another cord.4.  Not really that small.

So, i felt that it was necessary to give back to the community for all the great posts.  I just wanna say that if you are thinking about this camera you wont be disappointed.  The only thing that I could find on the cons with this one is that the manual controls are limited, there is no view finder and the dials are close together, this is true but, by eliminating the view finder you make more room for the 12x lens.  The dials are close together but they are really well designed.  The dial on the right takes a little pressure to get it to move so your not just gonna flip though modes on accident unless you are on caffeine.  Also the zoom control is like butter.......mmmmmm, great on toast.  The controls are limited, but at least they are there in the sub menu!  Once you know the way it operates you fly. It is a little bigger than I would have wanted but thats ok.  I keep it in a clean glasses bag and throw it in my pocket.

One can take pictures in a room (at night, with normal lighting on) without using the flash - this is how good the camera lens system is. Great feature when trying to shoot a sunset/sunrise too.2/ Great wide angle (26 mm equivalent) capture capability. I didn't know what I was missing before I got this camera. The best way I can describe the difference against that of a (normal) 35 mm equivalent lens, is this: standard vs. HD images. I don't care that you can get a 10 MP image with a 35 mm camera, you are still missing too much of what's in front of you.3/ excellent for inexperienced users (like myself). I like to point and shoot... and this camera does a great job, no matter what you through at it. I am not interested in manual controls, and with this camera I don't miss them.4/ good integration with the Panasonic TVs - I thought that I will look at all my pictures on the PC monitor, but I tried Viera Link and it worked beautifully. The only downside is that I didn't figure out how to play the movies with sound (I didn't open the manual so far).5/ Excellent LCD screen, a pleasure to use in all but the most intense sunlight.6/ good zoom. The 12X zoom is one of the reasons I decided to buy the camera for, and I've used it quite a bit. I've learned that the more zoom you have the more you want. Please note that for movies, the focus isn't fast enough, but in my experience this is not a big thing.7/ Unbelievable photo and video quality.What I don't like:1/ battery life - while the battery life is good for any camera, I found out that I need two batteries to get me through a day - 3-400 pictures and a few minutes of video. Buy a spare, you'll need it.2/ AVCHD Lite movie format. HD video from a camera is a great idea, and I have nothing but good words about the quality of HD video on this camera. However, I think that Panasonic should have included a format converter - and made the software ask if you want to convert the movies when syncing to the PC. I have trouble sharing the movies with my friends because of the format. I am thinking of using the other, less sophisticated format (a 16 GB card is only $40) to avoid the hassle, but want to make a comparison between the outcome before doing this.3/ The scene selection button is flimsy - quite frequently the camera is asking you to properly select the scene mode). This is an annoyance, with no effect on the camera's performance.4/ I would love to have all the options available under iA for pictures shot in wide angle format...

The whole AWB goes for a toss if you need to use the flash indoors. Combine that with b) and it's really like having no flash inside.d) Takes too long to take a photo: Everytime you take a photo, people start moving around before the photo is taken. Why? Because it uses two flashes, probably one for Red Eye Reduction, and the second for the actual photo.Other Minor issue: Camera is too small for my hands.

A huge downside is that \"Panasonic\" installed firmware in the camera so that only Official Panasonic batteries will work in it.  Panasonic's excuse of being concerned about battery \"safety\" is crap! It's all about PROFIT!  Battery life is quite short and only one battery comes with the camera.  So, those who buy this camera will need to buy an additional battery. Adding insult to injury, Panasonic has such contempt for their customers that they aren't making enough of their own \"Chinese-made Panasonic batteries\" to meet the demand (that they created) and are keeping the price high.2. AVCHDlite is a codec that won't work with any DVD player, HDTV or computer that doesn't already have the AVCHD codec installed.  Just by coincidence, newer Panasonic TV's do.  Having your HD movies in AVCHD is akin to trying to view a Sony Betamax videotape on a VHS player.  All through the instructions, there is the repeated warning that you can't play AVCHD encoded movies on almost anything but Panasonic equipment. Seems that the same VP who came up with the \"Panasonic Only\" battery firmware was in charge of this debacle as well.3. Good luck in getting AVCHD lite HD movies from your camera into your computer.  The braintrust at Panasonic once again have cocked-this-up bigtime.  I installed \"Photofunstudio\" on my computer, followed the directions precisely and still it refuses to upload newly-filmed AVCHD files from the camera to my computer.  All I get is an error code telling me that the video file may be \"corrupt\".  What's corrupt is Panasonic's integrity.  They immediately need to distribute software to their customers that WORKS WITH AVCHDlite, not like \"Photo-crap-studio\" which can't eve \"see\" existing AVCHD files in the camera. Interesting that Panasonic's engineers can develop a firmware update that \"lockout\" competitors batteries, yet they seem inept when it comes to making software which is actually needed to read AVCHD files recorded to and stored on the camera's SDHC card. Brilliant!4. Selecting the appropriate choice in SCN1, SCN2 or SCN3 is very time-consuming, requiring the user to know all the variables associated with each choice.5. All the warnings about where NOT to use the camera (no dust, moisture, heat, etc.) make it seem like this camera was only designed to be used in an indoor mall.6. Can't shoot photos in RAW.Now the good points:1. Love that 12X optical zoom - but you definitely need a tripod to stabilize the camera at anything over 4X zoom. I picked up a Gorillapod GP1 and it is great.2. On Automatic function, the camera is pretty quick to acquire the subject and keeps it in focus while framing the shot. (this probably accounts for much of the reduced battery life)3. Good feel in the hand, but a little \"rubbery grip\" strip for the thumb on the back would be a good idea.4. The flash is located where it's unlikely to be obstructed by a finger.5. Red eye elimination works well - so far.6. The ZS3 processor does a good job when using the flash where the foreground is lighter than the background.  Although it slows down the shutter, in most cases the whole of the image is evenly exposed with no blurring.7. Love the wide angle Leica lens.8.

A decision I did not second guess after playing with my camera.Out of the box, I was able to figure out all the basic features without needing to look in the guide. That is a huge plus for me. I like simplicity. Point and shoot! I could zoom, I could change the settings, I could change the quality of the picture right away. Video mode is very easy to use as well. I will say the high def video is a bit tricky because the format is different, which means it needs a conversion to be viewed and other technical stuff, yada yada yada, but the regular video is adequate and a lot less draining to the memory card.The portability of this camera is nice. After the bulky 610, this camera felt good in my pocket. The downside to other small cameras is that it does weigh a little more, and some of the entry levels are definitely smaller. However, the lens and zoom options allows this camera to have much better photo quality than the smaller sized ones. The zoom function is on the loud side, if that does bother anyone. Me?

One thing I did notice was that when I zoomed in or out during the video mode, there was a noice arising out of the movement of the lens barrel which was captured in the audio. However the camera does provide a zoom of 12X even in video shooting which is awesome.One more thing, the video gets stored as Panasonics proprietary AVCHD mode (and not WAV or MPEG-HD mode). Hence you will have to either purchase/search a software that converts AVCHD to HD or will have to download a software that plays AVCHD. I dont really find this such a big deal though, given that both Sony and Panasonic have standardized the AVCHD format over HD (I guess Canon uses Std. HD).Low light shooting is also okay, but not the greatest.Battery life is a little pain. I am not saying battery drains out too soon, but you should be aware that its not the greatest for this camera.

Compared to those cameras, the picture quality of the ZS3 leaves much to be desired.  Even at ISO 80, the strong noise reduction smears the fine detail, while leaving behind visible artifacts.  This was very noticeable, for instance, on the shaded portions of people faces.  There is little texture left in the skin, and yet, the noise reduction leaves behind artifacts that look like a mix of sparse grain, and pockmarks.The results were very much a negative suprise.  The sensor of the ZS3 is of similar size as the sensor of the Canon A720, and the A720 being two years or so older, we expected the ZS3 to be at least as good, if not better.  The converse is true: the A720 gives very good quality photos at base ISO, and up to ISO 200, while the ZS3 even at base ISO produces poor results.It was very surprising to us that this camera, which received such good reviews, would be so disappointing.We are somewhat experienced photographers, and we own several cameras, from the afore-mentioned Canon A620, A720 and Panasonic LX3, to various DSLRs.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Lens, Horrible Construction Quality, Terrible Customer Service", "Author": "Eric Kestler \"ek\"", "ReviewID": "R1TXGHDOJZ5G9T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Purchased this camera Nov. 10, 2009.

All test photos were taken indoors in lower light (our apartment does not provide a lot of natural light) because that is where I will be using my camera the most for a while.  Photos of our living room area, with the floor lamps on, produced photos where the light in the room looked orange and the images were dark.  Again, my husband and I played altered the camera's settings and were able to reduce the orange color a little bit but the photos were still not true to color or vibrant.Additionally, when I took a photo of my daughter at a 2ft distance indoors with a flash when the living room lights were on, she washed out and everything behind her went black.  I took photos at a higher ISO (800), which reduced the blackness behind her but the colors were not true.The video's are difficult to find on the camera and the format is hard to play for the layman user due to the video files not being in MPEG or another easy format for Windows media player to read.  I changed the video setting to MOV, which requires Apple Quick Time. The video quality in MOV setting was poor. Very, very, frustrating for the layman/average user. I did not like the software provided with the camera.I gave this camera two stars because the zoom is incredible.  A close up photo I took of my black cat indoors in the middle of the day with as much natural lighting as possible was amazing - sharp and clear - I could see each whisker in extraordinary detail.

My computer wouldn't read the 8 gig card, and I got an I/O error. On Craigslist computer forum, found people had trouble with PC reading their high capacity SD cards; there was a Windows patch I had to download. (The name of the exe file is WindowsXP-KB934428-v3-x86-ENU.exe) Then the PC at least read it, but the single frame ID photo wouldn't show up. What next...Others said I'd need also a dedicated SCHC READER (a regular SD card reader may be too antiquated), so back to the computer store and got one. Oh, don't forget to format the SD card.I did need a Lumix firmware update as my version was 1.0. The latest is Version 1.1, as of May 9, 09. Google \"Lumix DMC-ZS3 firmware\" to get to the Panasonic page. This will help reduce the autofocus motor noise, it says, and do a few other things. Complete instructions as well as download files for the TZ7 & FZ3 are on that page. Use a blank formatted SD card, and you should format after as well.Tested video mode to see what causes noises...that slight sharp clicking when zooming is the clicking of the tele/WA lever when it \"hit\" both extreme sides. I believe the more recent versions of this camera had adjustments by Panasonic to slow down the zoom speed, which was causing a lot of noise (see some samples of the TZ7 on YouTube...almost grinding). So the zoom's a little slow getting going, and one may tend to really slap the lever to kick start it. After a few weeks, I am used to the zoom and rarely make noise.All in all, I'd love the next version of this camera to have an external mic jack, and maybe even an external headphone jack. Or a way to swing the mics away from the camera body.The interesting thing on using AVCHD Lite on Vegas Movie Studio Platinum 9, was the double-image ghosting. I got suggestion from a camera forum regarding \"resampling.\" Please look at my CarolJWright YouTube channel for examples and exact solution.Also, I tried out a few things to help with this camera. The Cokin filter rack for Digital Cameras had several issues. Check out that review here on Amazon. One accessory that WILL work is the Hoodman Loupe, a black rubbery funnel with fine lens to view the LCD screen as a viewfinder. Whew! No more sun glare! Costly but will get one. It fits the 3\" screen of this camera and can be held on snugly with eye socket pressure with guidance from fingers.

Much less expensive SD cards were just fine to shoot video on every other camera I've owned at this price point.  This camera has just about the worst written manual I've ever seen.

The first purchase was the Canon 960is.  Please go check out my review on that camera if you are inclined.NOTE: This review will evolve over time as I use the camera.Before I get to any of the details I must inform any potential buyer of a problem that is absolutely infuriating and insulting.  That being the fact that the ZS3's firmware version of 1.2 forces you to utilize the OEM battery.  Why is this so infuriating you might ask?  Well because you can't purchase this battery anywhere.  I have gone to all of the vendor's listed on the Panasonic website and they are all out of stock with no estimate of when stock will return.Not letting this stop me I decided to call Panasonic, even though they indicate that you can not purchase the battery directly.  Surprisingly this is a lie.  The customer service representative has a battery for the camera, at a low low cost of $44.XX with a minimum $8.XX shipping charge.  So at ~16% of the cost of the entire camera new, I can purchase 1 more battery for the camera.  So be prepared to take your $300 purchase and jack it up to $400+ just so you can take the camera with you on a trip with sufficient backup batteries.Needless to say, Panasonic is starting on the wrong foot by imposing a firmware change that makes no sense at all.STRIKE 1.On to my initial impressions after 5 days of use.The camera itself has sturdy construction that I can't really find any problems with.  The weakest point would seem to be the battery/memory card cover.  It has a locking device that I do worry about long term.  One thing I find really nice is the placement of the flash in the middle of the unit itself rather than the the outside edge like my previous cameras.  I found myself covering the flash on my other cameras all the time.The screen quality is very nice; however, I do find that the display when you have the camera on lags badly during realtime display.  This is not the case while playback of video however.Pictures so far have been clear and I have not spent much time conducting tests in varied conditions.

Now with the ZS3 the 10 MP photos looked muddy and ill-focused, 5 MP and 3 MP of the same subject look much better.  I think it must be some issue with how the Preview program is set to display the photos.  When I change the jpegs to actual size, and zoom subjects in the 10 MP shot to the same size as the 5&3 MP shots they look almost identical (so I think the camera is focusing correctly) - but when I simply double-click on the jpegs the 10 MP shots look awful.  Is this because the 10 MP shots are downsampled more?  How can I get all the jpegs to render well?  Am I supposed to use some Preference setting like \"respect image and screen DPI for scale\"?

Initially when I got thecamera, I was very impressed with the quality of the images. However; I quickly realized thatthis camera was not manufactured with the quality that I have in my Sony cameras.

I used to have a canon Powershot A85 and it was good for my needs. But unfortunately it stopped working right in the middle of the trip.I do not take too many pictures and have little knowledge about photography. I was told by the representative at Costco that this is a great camera for people like me (who just want to click a photo). The higher optical Zoom and the HD video was kind of a bonus. In all, I paid around $300 dollars for it. But to my utter disappointment, the photos were not great (not even as good as my old Canon A85 - which I had bought for $150 four years ago).Here are some of the problems that I found:1. Picture quality was bad. I took photos in Zion national park on a sunny day (with the automatic settings) and the photos were below average.2. Pictures taken in places with lesser lighting were much worse.3. I like to have my pictures with date and time stamped on them but this camera requires that you manually stamp the date/time on each photo (it does not provide an option to enable date/time such that all future photos are automatically stamped). Furthermore, while putting the date/time stamp manually on a photograph, the camera tries to save the old (unstamped) photo in the new format. This means that if you are running low on space then it may not work unless you clear some of the photos. Also, stamping a photo automatically reduces the resolution for the photo to < 3Megapixel4. The video quality seemed good but then again the software that came along with it sucked. The videos are stored using the AVCHD format (which is proprietary of Sony/Panasonic) and the accompanied software does not allow it be stored in the more popular formats such as \"mp4\" or \"avi\". It allows you to burn it to a DVD though.. but that is an extra step that I do not like (and did not try).To conclude, I was not happy with the camera at all (especially given its price and in comparison to other cameras that I have used) and so I returned it back.", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera but Annoying", "Author": "Zac", "ReviewID": "RU3VENNZ7WAI7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Solid camera with lots of features but Panasonic needs to stop being annoying about locking this down.Annoyances:Non standard USB cableCan only use Panasonic battery (this should be illegal)Mode select turns way to easily and is in the wrong spotInconsistent picture quality (seems to be from flash)Otherwise fast great camera with good video quality.", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "DMC-ZS3 vs Samsung TL320", "Author": "Jeff L.

I am not a pro photog but am very particular about my photos. I have used a Casio Exilm EX-P700 for many years and it is, or was an excellent camera that always got it right, until recently it will only focus indoors about 30% of the time. My hope was to find something as good. The TL320 is built exceptionally well, menu system is a breeze, the Amoled screen is unbelievable, strong flash. The smart mode produces perfectly exposed and saturated, very sharp photos as long as it has good light. Anything outside well into dusk has been excellent. Bring it in the house with artificial light and the ISO jumps to 400 producing, in my opinion useless pictures. However switching it to Program mode and setting ISO to 200, contrast 0 ,sharpness 2,and saturation 2 almost always is just superb. ISO on auto almost never jumps above 200 unless real dark in P mode. I have tried every combination of all settings and this is what works best. Flash intensity and EV can be altered to taste and are very responsive, but it seems best as default in all but mentioned. Upping the contrast to 1 will really define things but you need good light or details in the darker areas are less evident. All in all , I just Love this camera and have yet to see any printed (4x6) pictures from any camera rival it. Got the Panasonic at the same time to see what I liked best. The Panny was the only camera that I found to ever get 5 stars in a pro review, and the customer reviews mostly glowed with praise. Panasonic build quality is way below the TL. Feels cheap, very few controls, screen is ok, but not close to the TL. Flash is completely useless. Anything in limited light at all is just junk. No controls to make it work. I put it on a tripod in my living room at night with 2 table lamps in the room and stood the length of my coffee table  from the camera and I could hardly tell it was me! Did the same with the TL and I could count the hairs in my mustache. Outside in good light it does a good job, but identical pictures from both camera's enlarged on my pc showed the TL to have better detail. In summary, I don't know how the DMC-ZS3 gets such great reviews and the TL320 worse and much fewer. Also the battery life is pathetic. The TL is possibly 3 times better.  Maybe people aren't taking Samsung seriously and just not buying, and the pro reviewers seem somewhat biased. Long and short of it, the Panny went back and the TL stayed.

Is picture quality important?2. Do I want the subject of the picture to be in focus?3. Do I EVER use my camera indoors?4. Do I want to occasionally shoot high quality HD video with my camera?5. Do I want the battery to last more than 2 hours when taking pictures/video?If you answered yes to any/all of the above questions stay FAR away from this camera. I don't recall ever being so dissatisfied with an electronics purchase. The pictures are almost all blurry (even with the auto mode IAF turned on). Any shots taken indoors are ridiculously grainy and very very poor quality. I know most ccd's for digital cameras suffer in low light situations, but this is by FAR the worst I have EVER seen. The flash makes many pictures look worse.. as everything in the foreground is awash with super bright light and everything behind the subject is pitch black. Red eye reduction works sometimes, but still drowns out the backgrounds. The camera is supposed to shoot HD video as well. There are notes on the box and the camera itself touting the AVCHD format (it also shoot motion jpeg but that is not HD). Let me be the first to say that my standard def camcorder takes better images in all lighting conditions (and that shoots at 640x480). Something that is touted as a feature for video is the ability to zoom while filming. Unless you want the noise of the lense moving to drown out the audio of what you are shooting, I wouldn't recommend using it. Last but certainly not least is the battery life...or more specifically the lack thereof. I have NEVER used a device, any device, that goes through batteries this fast. We charged the battery for a full 8 hours on Christmas eve in anticipation of using the camera all day. Not 2 hours in with mixed video and stills and the battery indicator is blinking on the display (it ran out 5 minutes later and shut off). Utterly ridiculous. To continue, the mode switch button feels like it belongs on a 5 dollar plastic toy. It feels as if it is going to break off with normal use.The only thing that is any good on this camera is the display on the back. Unfortunately what you see is NOT what you get.I have always been partial to Canon cameras. The model I replaced the Powershot A70 was an AWESOME camera. The images it took were amazing indoors or out. It would still be in use today if it had not broken (son dropped it accidently). That camera would last almost a WEEK on a single charge.My friend has a Sony (don't recall which model) and it takes MUCH better photos, MUCH MUCH better videos (in actual HD), and costs 129.00 less than this camera. I may have to look into that after I dump this thing on Ebay (unfortunately it is beyond the return period). I made the mistake of taking some outdoor photos when I first got the camera. They looked good. Unfortunately we don't hold Christmas or many other holidays (bar 4th of July) outdoors.I am just trying to figure out if I got a really bad camera in an otherwise great line, or if all these reviews are smoke and mirrors. I don't usually review these things, rarer still will I bad mouth something, however this thing has ruined 2 birthdays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas this year with photos that look like they were taken with a 6 dollar disposable camera.

I did not realize that when I bought it, except that I noticed at the store that photos looked FAR BETTER at 5 MP than 10 MP!  It is even better to opt for the \"Class 10\" media.  I bought one Panasonic 16 GB \"Class 10\" media when I bought the camera.  I WISH I had bought more and used THEM instead of the 8 GB, \"Class 4\" or \"Class 6\" that I had brought with me from home.  If you're going to spend the money for the camera, use the BEST media you can get!(2) YOU CANNOT GET EXTRA OEM *PROPRIETARY* BATTERIES, CHARGER or POWER SUPPLY!!!I have been reading that the \"over-the-counter\" batteries will not work with the ZS3 due to a \"Firm Ware\" upgrade, so, since I spent what I did for the ZS3, I wanted to get OEM Panasonic batteries, charger and power supply.  I had also heard that the \"over-the-counter\" batteries would overheat and cause problems.Unfortunately, because of ONLY having ONE battery (DMW-BCG10PP), and having to carry the OEM charger (DE-A65B) around with me every time I want to take photos, I lost my OEM charger and have not been able to charge the ONLY battery supplied for several weeks.After an EXHAUSTIVE, but unsuccessful search since then, and because I could not find another OEM charger (DE-A65B) ANYWHERE locally or online, last night, I ordered an OEM PROPRIETARY power supply (DMW-AC5PP) that was SUPPOSED to fit the ZS3, and got it overnighted.  It DID NOT fit!!!  It wasn't even close!!!The fitting on the power supply I received looks like what you would plug into a portable hard drive (sort of a small trapazoid shape).  The receptacle on the camera is about 50% larger and more rectangular with slight extensions on the bottom at the left and right edges.  There is NO comparison in size or shape.The ZS3's instructions say/show that DMW-AC5PP is the correct part number, and the DMW-AC5PP power supply itself says/shows that it is a DMW-AC5PP (as do its instructions), but the BOX says/shows it is a DMW-AC5 (i.e. without the PP) and it DOES NOT FIT!!!I WANT to order a couple of extra batteries and OEM charger, but I am VERY leery now.  Even Panasonic said THEY don't even have extra batteries or another charger, and that it would take 3+ weeks for THEM to get any.  Interestingly, they told me I needed to order a DMW-BCG10 (i.e. without the PP at the end), but suggested I order it from a local dealer.  They don't have either the DMW-BCG10PP or the DMW-BCG10, and after my experience, I don't TRUST what Panasonic says is the correct size!My daughter's 10 year old birthday party is THIS coming Sunday (four days from now) and I CAN'T GET ANY MORE BATTERIES and I CAN'T GET ANYTHING to charge the ONLY battery I have!!!I had bought the ZS3 on the first day of our vacation in Vancouver on 05/30/2009, because I had accidentally left my camera in my car at the airport in the US.I tried buying a couple of extra batteries and another charger when I bought the ZS3, but Panasonic had not even made them available at all yet!Since they ONLY supply ONE battery, and you can't even BUY spares, and I was going on an Alaskan cruise (and wanting to take LOTS of photos), I had to keep charging my ONLY battery every time I stopped to eat, then make sure I remembered to retrieve it before leaving the restaurant.  Thankfully, it only happened twice, and there were only so many places I would have had to go to to retrace my steps to find it.Unfortunately, I have now lost the charger and have no idea where.  It wouldn't be so bad if you could just easily BUY another one---that FITS!And, of course, I would NOT have lost it at all had I been ABLE to buy extra PANASONIC OEM *PROPRIETARY* batteries and charger (and/or power supply) when I bought the ZS3, so I could leave the charger AT HOME.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera BUT", "Author": "J.

To my knowledge,Canon has never done this with any of their cameras.There may have been and probably were good reasons to disable generic batteries,but one would think that in 4 or 5 months, replacement brand batteries would be available.I, for one, always travel with a spare battery since the ability to recharge a battery when desired.in some 3rd world country is always questionable.as far as I Know the CGA-S005A battery used in the LX3 is not chipped and is used in many other Panasonic camerasso there should never be a problem with third-party batteries being locked out with a firmware update.The S90IS uses a NB-6L which is used in the SD770IS and SD1200ISso it should be widely available from third party manufacturers and also isn't chipped as far as I Know..If that battery is so easily available then why all the complaints on the Panasonic Forum site?The Panasonic battery for that camera is listed as out-of-stockwhile all the generic batteries have the caution \"not for cameras put into service after April 2009\".People who own the ZS3 are complaining to Panasonic & have not received any answers about when spare batteries would be available.SignedDoctor Jerry,********************************************************************************AGIN The above part of this Review was Not done by me,although I to am varry concerned about these compelling issuesas i to am or was Varry interested in buying the Lumix ZS3 till i read this :(& I can only hope this saves others from making a huge mistake in buying Lumix ZS3 if this is indeed true i myself find it horrable that a company would do this?2 things I myself will add to this is that iv confirmed as true are the 2 Problems everyone have been complaining about the Panasonic Lumix ZS3#1 are the WEAK SPRING USED IN THE ZOOM LEVER CAUSING IT TO STICK & NOT AUTOMATICLY RETURN TO ITS PROPER POSITION,?#2 PROBLEM,IS WHERE PANASONIC GOT STUPIDLY LAZYWhen Panasonic Noticed the Option scene Dial Wheel allowed to moves out of bounds beyond its intended Position & in return gives you an Error messegecausing you to mis that special one time rare shot. :(instead of Limiting the dial from goiing out of bounds,instead PANASONIC spent more time making the Camera A.I Smart to it will display this Error Messege instead of just limiting the dial,HOW FOOLISHLY LAZY IS THAT? :(Panasonic has still not Fixed either of these other additional Design Flawstodate as this messege was Posted, NOVEMBER-15-2009 :( HAPPY CAMERA HUNTING TO YOU ALLI HOPE YOU ALL GET A VARRY NICE CAMERA YOU ARE HAPPY WITH HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO YOU ALL :)", "Date": "November 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "I will ignore the baying dogs at my feet!", "Author": "Amazoner \"reader, thinker, doer\"", "ReviewID": "R3JNP569UK82P1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Added 11/20/09:On impulse, I bought the zs3. I was swayed by the many 5-star reviews. As I said before, I want RAW, but I figured I would live with the jpeg until the manufacturers get their trip together. :)But then something happened I find disturbing.Amazon shipped it without any packing, and the unpadded camera box was just thrown into the Amazon ship box. The camera rattled around inside the bigger shipping box.I see a number of reviews of defective cameras on this site, and I wonder what the packing was like - or wasn't.Now, this has become all too common a practice in careless sweat shop operations. I once bought a $800 Nikon lens from Adorama that was shipped like this - toss and forget.I am sure these items are too fragile to be treated like this. If I bought this camera at a Radio Shack, and the sales person just tossed it on the floor rather than handing it to me, I would blow my stack. After all, I just paid for this item, it is now my property, and you are treating it in a destructive and careless manner. And this is exactly what Amazon is doing with my purchase.Jeff Bezos built a great company, Amazon, and unfortunately obviously incompetent managers are busily undermining it. sad. Score one for the Lilliputs.Added 11/23:HaHa I have to laugh at the snarling Besenjis of mediocrity! Just kidding. Everyone has potential, so have hope. About the camera:The lcd is good, and the depth of field for close shots is excellent, if you want that. One commenter, a rare observer not suffering from a tightie, said that a Nikon is gonna be like hauling a big load around. I agree totally.But then I noticed something disturbing about the pictures of the zs3.When I zoomed a pic all the way, the edges were not \"tack sharp.\"So I shot the same thing (a fern plant) with a $3000 Nikon. Same result.Why? The explanation I come to is that the lcd screen can't track the higher magnifications. The check on this will be to print out the pic even at 8.5x11 size and see how sharp it looks. That's critical, because people notice subconsciously whether a photo is not sharp, and photographers have a bag of tricks to get sharpness. First, pics in low light suffer most from this, since the shutter is open longest, and hand-shake introduces blur. Ways to get sharp photos: hold your elbows tightly to your body, exhale and hold your breath, easily, squeeeze slowly the button like a sniper, if possible, brace the camera against anything solid (not your dog), use flash can help.I offer these tips in case a reader has not heard them.
