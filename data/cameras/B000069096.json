I've been using them all a lot.Coolpix 4500 Pros:- Very good overall picture quality if you use the following settings:1600 x 1200 resolution (downsampling algorithm does a great job - I usually shoot at 2 mp when travelling to save space without losing much quality); medium quality jpeg; sharpening +1- Sturdy all metal swivel design body allows you all sorts of shots that would be impossible to take with other types of camera.- Fits in pocket (even though it is not really slim)- Best macro of all compacts - if you need close-ups, the Coolpix is about the best choice around- Lens is not extending out of camera body, so it is well protected from mechanical damage and dust (look at all those flaky extensible plastic gadgets on other cameras!). - Accessory lenses available, especially the teles are excellent- Best choice of options available in compacts, everything can be adjusted according to personal taste. All sorts of exposure and focus options a modern higher end SLR has.- Good lithium battery with fast 2 hour charger (get a spare battery, though!)- Still good quality at 400, usable at 800 ISO!- Histogram allows you to check exposureCons:- Lens does not deliver enough detail to take full advantage of the chip's 4 megapixels. No improvement compared to 995 (3 mp).- Little direct access to functions; you spend a lot of time fumbling- Multi-level menus that are SLOW to navigate- Slow lens (maximum aperture) at tele position); try 200 ISO whenever necessary- Shutter delay too long (apparently slower than 995) for candid shots or anything that moves quickly- LCD (1,5\") is too small, especially if you have eye problems; the 995 had a 1,8\", the 950 a 2\" screen!- Distortion (pincushion at wideangle, barrel at tele)- Does not focus well at low lighting levels (no AF assistance light)- Clipped highlights (no detail in light areas while the rest is properly exposed; underexposing does not help much)My conclusion:I you want to shoot sports and under low light situations, or if you need the best resolution, get something else, If you need to travel light, take close-ups, take pictures discreetly, need some more tele (with or without accessory lens) and are content with (very good) 2 megapixel pictures, get the Coolpix 4500.", "Date": "January 15, 2003"}, {"Title": "if you're intrigued by the coolpix line, this is the one", "Author": "\"day_vit13\"", "ReviewID": "R3JND672W9WRHJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not to sound like a negatron, but some of the previous reviewers aren't really qualified to comment on this camera.  It's features are wasted on them.  Too small?  Q: What is the best camera?  A: The one you take with you and always have in your hand.  Don't kid yourself-- if a camera is even slightly bulkly or cumbersome to haul around (as both the 990 and 995 are) you won't carry it and it will quickly migrate directly to your closet.  In this regard, the 4500 really shines.  Lightweight, portable, truly pocket-sized (i.e., you don't have to cram it in there and it doesn't feel like a brick thumping against your leg after 5 minutes).  Second, the swivel design is excellent for capturing candids.  You can hold the camera at your waist and fire off shots without anyone being the wiser.  No hands covering faces, no corny poses, just people as they are.  Try to get shots like that with a typical point-shoot or SLR.  Too mechancial?  Come on!  I suppose some people can't handle two moving parts.  Anyway, there is no need to twist the cam to take shots-- if you want to hold the camera up to your face like a typical point-and-shoot, in it's default position, nothing's stopping you.  It works great that way as well.  Trust me, there isn't anything 'weird' about this device that someone with an ounce of common sense can't handle.  Finally, this was a reasonably priced camera when it first came out.  Now, at the current price with all the discounts and rebates, it's a steal.  But yeah, if you're looking for solid quality at absolute bargain basement prices and the 4500 is too much, skip the 995 and go right to the 990.  That is the camera I used up until recently as a backup to my pro-grade D100 for model shoots.  The fact that an older model in this line has that sort of credibility should tell you something about the quality you can expect from the newer 4500.", "Date": "November 23, 2002"}, {"Title": "Coolpix 4500 Vs. 995", "Author": "\"skhorn\"", "ReviewID": "R1QN95A2V9A21I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall the 4500 is a solid camera with many advantages over the 995, however, the 995 hasd a few features that are missing or better than the 4500.Pros of the 4500:Scene modes-it is much quicker (less battery drain) to set the scene than it was with the 995.User interface-while the LCD on top is gone it is still pretty easy to tell what options you have on for the mode you are in.Video-Video with sound is nice and I thought I really needed it but so far not a big deal.  It is very nice to be able to shoot a little video but still shoot GREAT photos!Pros of the 995:The flash- While it required the user to extend the flash to use it, it seems more powerful and more effective at a greater distance than the 4500's flash.  I shoot many shots inside large dark spaces (caves and tunnels) where there is no power and a long ways from any roads so the flash is handy.  To overcome the 4500 flash I would need to buy both the SK-E900 ($70+) & an SB series flash like the 80DX ($325) OR a SB-22s ($115), so I can get a good flash for about $185 new.Both cameras produces beautiful, crisp images and overall, you get a lot of camera for your money.I would recommend getting a 256MB flash card (or bigger) and a spare battery (although I have yet to need it.)  I have been able to shoot over 100 photos with flash on most of them with both cameras on one fully charged battery.Recommendation:  If you want the latest and the best go with the 4500, but if you want a good camera for a good price, check out the 995 at an online auction or Nikon's refurbished cameras at Nikonmall or Amazon for used.", "Date": "October 3, 2002"}, {"Title": "Much better than the predecessor", "Author": "Matt \"mattfl1\"", "ReviewID": "R218II6EFPHDK5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I didn't care much for the Coolpix 995 when it was out.  The 4500 (which is the 995's replacement) is much better in my opinion.  The body size has been greatly reduced.  Unfortunately that also resulted in a reduction in screen size, but I guess that was unavoidable.  Excellent image quality, excellent macro mode (3/4 inch!), good zoom.  It comes with a different battery charger, probably because the ones that were included with the 995 were awful (I work at a camera store and they came back defective all the time).  The software leaves something to be desired--invest in something like Adobe Photoshop Elements to do your editing.

I'm still new to photography, but I can say that so far, the 4500 is an excellent camera. The 4500 takes absolutely beautiful pictures, and the 16 modes go a long way to help novices take great looking pictures in all kinds of conditions. I like the new modes included over the Coolpix 885. The sports mode works well, and the panorama mode makes it very easy to create composite shots that look like they were created by a professional. Focusing is quick, and pop-up flash works well, and the camera feels solid. Above all, it's pictures are amazingly detailed, with grat color reproduction.

The bottom line is image quality -- the 4500 produces beautiful pictures if you know how to use it properly.  This a compact camera that's loaded with features.  The LCD screen is 1.5 inches, most are 1.8 -- I have no trouble seeing mine.  The menus are complex at first, but after you use it a while, the menus become simple and easy to navigate.  The wide range of settings requires an elaborate menu system.  If you're just going outdoors taking pictures during the day, point and shoot works perfect. The camera's weight with the battery is a little over 12 ounces.  I doubt that's going to wear someone's arm down.  If you're looking for a compact camera that takes sharp, colorful pictures, buy the Coolpix 4500.

Mills", "ReviewID": "RCWV1AUEOY6SE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did alot of research before I bought this camera a year ago. The research has paid off dividends. First off this is a great Camera!!. I bought it for two main reasons. One was astrophotography and the other was just going on trips and tooling around. Pros of this camera:-Intuitive (after the manual is browsed) B+-Picture Quality A+-User controllability A++ (my cousin has the Fuji and you can't manually control anything, just a bunch of predefined settings. Alot of the other cameras were like this)-up to 5 min of keeping the shutter open (nice for astrophotography, but you do need the remote for this)A+-The Auto Focus is Great with even marginal light B+-When you controll the settings yourself you can get very artsy with your photos (this is sort of cool)Cons:-In very low light situations the focus can have trouble but I have rarely noticed this, besides there is a manual focus if the light is way too dim, and I mean waay.!!!ONE IMPORTANT SUGGESTION!!!! If you decide to buy this camera buy one of those screw on UV filters. It has no negative effects in picture quality, only positive effects, and it can save your lense. After fifteen days of owning the camera I accidentally scratched the lense. It was minor but I was SOOOOO pissed after spending all this cash, so i tried to replace the camera through the in store warranty, but it was void by the time I found the scratch. So I bought a $15 UV filter and no scratches since. However, if I do get one, it's on a $15 dollar lense I can easily replace. Also Once you clean your primary lense and screw on the UV filter you won't have to clean under there until you remove it. It's a pretty cheap invesment for alot of benefit.

The Coolpix 4500 is priced right, plus it has the resolution I want for enlarged photos. I have produced 15 x 11-inch exhibition prints with this camera. They are tack sharp. One of the alluring features of this camera is that it is inconspicuous. You can take photos and it does not bring attention to itself. When I am shooting with a Nikon F100, sometimes an observer wants to know what I am shooting. He or she will even suggest what to shoot. When I am shooting with the 4500, fewer strangers, if any, intervene.Sometimes I shoot from my kayak. When doing so, I like to shoot right at water level. With an slr camera, this is impossible. With the 4500, I can twist the viewfinder so I am looking down while the lens is facing my subject (grasses, lobster buoy, etc). With an optional viewing hood on the LCD I can see clearly despite the sun.  I am getting images I would not get otherwise.You can also use this camera effectively in candid street photography. Use the twist feature and your subject will not suspect you are photographing him or her. Your subject can even be behind you.This camera also takes an off-the-camera flash. I use a Nikon SB-28DX with my F100. This Speedlight is compatible with the 4500 as well. I have a bracket that holds the camera with the flash to the side with a sync cord attached. This feature, of course, eliminates red-eye and fosters more candid portrait photos.I bought this camera primarily for its:- 4-megapixel resolution,- very sharp lens,- 4x-optical zoom (compares to 38-155mm on a 35mm camera),- 3/4 inch macro AF mode,- twist feature,- compatibility with my Nikon Speedlight,- various drive modes (P, A, S, M),- three-mode metering which includes spot,- compatibility with auxiliary lenses, and its- \"low-key\" appearance. However, I am discovering all kinds of features I enjoy using. These include:- a five-area multi-focus system,- one-touch uploading of photos, and- auto-exposure bracketing with white balance and exposure values,- plus more.Does this mean I will stop using my F100? No. I can create larger quality prints with the F100.  The two cameras complement each other. The 4500 enables me to experiment without the expense of film, see immediate results, then apply the features to the F100.  And, as mentioned, the 4500 enables me to get out-of-reach shots.", "Date": "December 29, 2002"}, {"Title": "Not as small, but the best.", "Author": "Alejandro Germenos", "ReviewID": "RKE0B6VFOWEBF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi.I've had a Coolpix 775, a Coolpix 995, the Canon Powershot S30 and now this one.

This camera just came out about a month ago, thus no way he could had used in his field research in Peru! Thus his review for this camera I would say is a bit invalid if not biast.The Nikon 4500 is a much improved version of the 950-990 series, with more features and more user friendly. It is not a perfect camera, no camera is but it will give you very good results without to much know how. I biggest concern with Nikon digital cameras that they tend to be a bit blue biast, and I owned several digital Nikons, including 950, 995 and D100, thus a I recommend software designed for editing digital photos in which you can correct the proper color balance. Adobe Photo elements version 1 or 2 are good as well as Paintshop Pro 7. Apart from this minor problem, you will be happy with this camera as long as you get youself a 256 MB CF card, don't even bother with a 128 MB or less, the prices came down so much for the CF cards lately that you can pick up a good brand like Lexar or Viking for very little.", "Date": "August 18, 2002"}, {"Title": "Brilliant camera for ones who have time", "Author": "Charmaine", "ReviewID": "R310E2N3WRFYN0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, first of all, I'm a 14-year-old wanting to just snap some pictures on the go, and something I could afford.

The setting options are endless, but if you don't want to fool around, that's fine. Auto mode is your friend. And for those who say the menus are hard to control...sure, it could be easier. But after reading the manual, the controls really aren't THAT hard. The swivel design is really clever...and yes, Nikon customer service is horrid, but then again, so are many other companies. You've got to admit, Nikon makes amazing cameras.If all you want is a little techie toy to show off to your friends and take some pictures, look somewhere else. It's rather bulky sometimes, but the good factors definitely outweigh that. It's not the most cool-looking camera in the world, but I'm glad Nikon focused on quality instead.And one more thing...when they said that having to take the battery out to recharge was a bad thing? It's not, necessarily. Think about it. If you have a backup battery (like me), it is SO much better to be able to use the camera, then when one battery runs out, put it to charge while you use the other battery to keep snapping pictures.

What sold me over the Canon G2 was the macro capabilities and the ring-light that was available, as I will be using it for both personal and dental (ie: macro) uses.  I dont' find the menus too complex or anything like that....most things are just 2-3 clicks away at the most, and the menus are easy to follow.  The ONLY negative I have found so far is that some things can \"wash out\" with the flash if taken 1-3 feet range, but you can avoid this by backing up and zooming in to the desired distance.

It is when you try to stretch it a bit, like I did, to get it to replace a beloved old Olympus OM-10 SLR I have had for 20+ years, you really start to understand the limitations of the current crop of digicams (to separate them from the still-too-expensive-for-my budget digital SLRs).  To Nikon's credit, they have produced a number of really nice accessory lenses and flashes for this camera, and its ability to make really close-up macro shots and assisted panoramas still astounds me.  Even with items like their wide-angle and tele-adapters, etc, though, there are still about three major shortcomings that will eventually force me to look at the new crop of under-$1000 digital SLRs that will be coming out in the next year or so.1) Now matter how you cut it, a max F3.5/F5.6 (wide/tele) lens is too slow for any real handheld available light work, unless you are outdoors.  I've tried handholding indoor shots with it, and experienced too much camera shake because of the slow shutter speeds.  There is simply no substitute for a fast (F1.8 or better) prime lens when you need to get that shot without a glaring flash.2) You would think that the slow lens situation would be helped by cranking up the ISO, say to 400.  Unfortunately, the noise at ISO 400 in this camera is unacceptable to me.  Again, to Nikon's credit, they have a really nice noise reduction function, that substracts a dark frame in the camera, but this doubles your time between shots, and that can be a real issue if say, you are snapping shots of the Disney electrical parade.3) Electric zoom -- one word, ich!  It's OK for camcorders, where a jerky manual zoom is considered poor camera technique, but in a still camera, it only slows you down.  Forget trying to do action/sports photography with the camera.  Even if the focus could follow a changing scene (and it is no stellar performer, there), the zoom is glacial in comparison.  Give my a push/pull manual zoom ring on a fast lens anyday.So, given all the limitations of such a system, it doesn't appear to be worth tossing all the cash into the camera, lens, and accessories, only to have an \"SLR-wannabee\".  The camera, etc. is bulky enough that I have to make a conscious decision to pack it for a trip, just like an SLR system would be.  Better to spend your cash on the smallest pocketable miniature digicam you can, like the super-small Canons or Minoltas (these days they produce excellent 3- and 4- megapixel pictures), and save your money for one of the newer digital SLRs coming out, if you are really yearning to 'go digital' and retire that trusted old SLR.  And don't forget that big investment in 'glass' you may have with your old SLR system.  Hopefully will be able to reuse some of it, until you can afford the truly astronomical prices that some of the new glass for digital SLRs are going for.", "Date": "September 19, 2003"}, {"Title": "great overall", "Author": "noob \"nobody\"", "ReviewID": "R2F6KK1IVPJNRE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "From an overall standpoint, this camera is great.

It is now set to program mode and focuses only when I want it too. Not a bad compromise. 2) Focus time and shutter lag seem a bit longer compared to the G2, but just a little anticipation overcomes this limitation easily (trying to catch my 18 m/o boy in action indoors). 3) Flash not too powerful- I see this is a common gripe.

I give it four stars; here's why: the quality of the build is good but for the following things: focus motor connector came loose once and rubber strip on front is now super-glued. i am a journalist, so i beat the hell outta these things. as far as function: the tele-converter tc-e33d 3x is worthless on this camera without a tripod and the results are questionable even with. Performance in low light is not good.  Battery life is good. And the fact that you can pop in disposables available anywhere is a blessing. Oh, the AV output connector stopped outputting some time ago...the socket in the camera is defective i suspect.  BUT THE AMAZING THING is the camera's clarity in closeup mode using the WC-E24 lens. It's what you would expect from a professional SLR, but not in a consumer digital.

Since I don't think that reviews written when the item is new are very useful, I waited for six months to pass and the camera had some use.  I now find it all I hoped for, and more!  There is only one annoying characteristic and that is the shutter delay, but it is something you learn to anticipate.  Pictures are very good (don't make decisions based on the small canera screen) and really come alive when uploaded to the computer.  You do need experience to learn the extensive menus and you will find things contained that are very hard to get back to, but it is all there!

If you are getting something in this range, get a 995. It will be cheaper since it is an old model and although at 3.34megapixel, it is a minor difference. I just did exactly that! If you take 100-200 high resolution (Fine, 3:2) photos with frequent use of flash in one outing, immediately get a couple of 256MB RAM cards and an extra rechargeable battery. With the money saved buying a 995, you can do this.In both, the swivel action is very useful (360 degrees in this model) and the pop up flash is a great improvement from the 990! And the rechargeable battery is useful. The 4500 is smaller and easier to stuff into your belt when cycling! It has a higher rating for optical zoom and resolution but I did not feel it was worth it. Much better to go for the 5700 if you can afford it, but that is much bulkier.
