{"Reviews": [{"Title": "HUGE disappointment", "Author": "mama3sands", "ReviewID": "R1M63WJU6YSP68", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this camera for my 10 year old to take to camp, instead of her more expensive digital camera. Big mistake. The manual is on a disc, and she didn't have time to load it and read it before she left. The camera is not intuitive to use at all, so she only got to take 30 photos instead of the 100 that the camera boasted. We tried to load the photos onto our PC, but the software wouldn't work with Windows Vista. There is no other place on the internet to load the drivers for this particular camera. I loaded the software onto my mac, which worked, but somehow in the process of trying to load to the PC or the mac, all of the photos were deleted from the camera. My daughter is going to be unbelievably disappointed.I can deal with the wasted money, it's my daughters lost memories that I am struggling with.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R3UOXFXELBNW9H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "1. Unlike most other digital cameras (even many of the cheap ones) this one cannot act as a generic USB storage device (thumb drive).  Plug any other camera into your computer and its storage appears as an external drive from which you can directly copy the picture files.  Not so with this camera - you MUST use the provided software to copy the images from the camera, even though it uses a USB plug to do so.2. Despite claims that this device is Mac-compatible, there is no provided Mac software, nor is the provided software compatible with Windows 7.  Referencing back to point 1, you cannot copy images off this camera onto a Mac or Win7 machine.  Windows XP is really the only compatible operating system.  (You can run it in a Virtual Machine under Mac or Win7.)3. Also unlike other digital cameras, the on-board memory is NOT flash memory.  Flash memory does not require power.  If the batteries in this camera run down or are removed, all onboard memory is cleared.  YOU LOSE YOUR PICTURES.4. The LCD preview window is VERY low quality, and shows little more than a blur most of the time, unless your target holds still for several seconds.  This is more common in the low-end cameras.5. The manufacturer provides no support.  If you lose the driver software CD, tough.  They have NO drivers available for download from their site, for any of their products - and therefore have no pipeline to provide newer drivers for Mac or Win7.6. The camera is cheap.  My son dropped it and the latch that holds the battery compartment closed cracked.  The battery compartment now springs open if you aren't holding it shut.  Referencing back to point 3, every time the batteries fall out, you lose any pictures you've taken.In short, this camera cannot actually be used to take pictures.  If your kids want a toy camera, get them a cheap plastic one.  If your kids want to take pictures, get a real camera.", "Date": "April 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "DON'T BUY", "Author": "Davo \"davosan\"", "ReviewID": "R1JUOFQOR18QMI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought two of these cameras in Target as a gift for my 2 kids (5 & 4 years old). I thought it was using old technology to make it cheaper, but I was totally mistaken by thinking that this camera would work at all.First of all, this camera cannot act as a generic USB storage device, so when you plug it in, you cannot directly copy the picture files on your computer. You must die with the included software that does not recognize the camera no matter what. One of the cameras is recognized and the other one does not.The LCD is a very low quality one. You just get blurry images unless you point the camera and hold it still for a long time. Try to explain that to a 4 years old kid! The pictures become all blurry as well.The manufacturer provides no support. They have NO drivers available for download.Conclusion: DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE. Buy a real camera. Even if you spend 50 more bucks you will avoid a lot of frustration and disappointment for you and your kids.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "doesn't work with our Mac and etc.", "Author": "sutari", "ReviewID": "R3HSC7H496KXW5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Wish I had read these reviews before our impulse buy at Target for Christmas. This camera is terrible. Our daughter happily ran around taking pictures all day (even though the display screen is awful --there is a lag time and the image is very blurry). My husband (who is no dope) installed the \"Image Zone\" software that came with the camera because you can't get the pictures out any other way. Somehow during all this he managed to delete all of today's pictures. So he took another test picture, plugged in the camera, and nothing. Our Mac, which all the documentation claims is compatible, will not recognize the camera. We tried repeatedly. There is no online support from Vivitar, a few forums say people had the same problem, but nothing suggested how to solve it. So we have a camera that takes pictures of unknown quality and no way to get them out of the camera.  Sigh. I hope the store will take this piece of junk back.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$39.95", "Features": null, "Name": "Vivitar 1.3MP Digital Camera - Black (VS18B)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pABqbj88L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002KUXDSE"}}
