Boone", "ReviewID": "R1UYJIVAIR63NN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After using this camera for a longer period of time, I have a bit more to say about it than my initial review. While I originally touted the manual controls, I found that they were not as useful in real world situations as they were while simply getting to know the camera. This camera performs well in daylight, but shots requiring a flash will drive you nuts because of the long recycle time.The Good:* Compact size with great zoom (best feature)* Great color (in good lighting)* Flash is easy to control (doesn't fire when you don't want it to, a problem I've had with many other cameras)* Nice LCD* Comfortable grip, better than a mid-size pocket camera* Easy to use* Manual controls are easier than other compact camerasThe Bad:* Flash can take up to 10 seconds to recycle, not good for people photos (for example, if you shoot a photo of a friend and find that it needs more light, you pop up the flash and have to wait 10 seconds before you can take another photo. most people find this wait time annoying.)* Dead batteries leave the lens halfway retracted (making it risky to transport the camera until fresh batteries are installed)* High ISO is too noisy (common with compact cameras, but I've seen other compacts that do better than this one when it comes to noise)Overall opinion:At this price point, the good mostly outweighs the bad here. If you are looking for a camera for travel, this gives you a long zoom, and thus a lot more freedom in what you can shoot, than a standard 3x zoom, without the bulk and weight of larger cameras and DSLRs. If your photography consists of mainly people, at all hours of the day and indoors, you might want to avoid this camera as it will feel too slow to get the shots you want. If your photography does NOT consist of mostly people, then this camera should work great.", "Date": "November 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Light, pretty and useful", "Author": "Alexandre Maron \"Novelty Seeker\"", "ReviewID": "RXECAWORF3FTP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I already have a SLR digital Rebel, but it is too big to carry to some places. So I was looking for something small, light and with enough features to keep me, a SLR buff, interested.My wife wanted a sleeker, colorful and tiny camera. I felt that we needed a more jack of all trades model. So I looked for a good optical zoom (10x), and as much manual features as possible. I ended up with three cameras: a Sony, a Canon and a Panasonic. It didn't take much testing to see that Canon was superior in every aspect.The menus are simpler than Sony's. The physical buttons are better placed and bigger than Panasonic's. The only thing that I will miss is to have  wider lens. Both Sony and Panasonic have wider angles, good for that classic auto-photo with your friends in a club.Other than that... My god. This camera is amazing. I didn't need the manual to figure the commands out. Everything is where it is supposed to be. You just navigate and the commands just appear in context of what you are selecting. So, if you are in full auto, you won't find controls for Manual Focus and flash. But if you change to other programs, these options are there.The manual commands are great. The manual focus is almost perfect and the ISO options work perfectly. I prefer the way they built the flash: it does not open automatically when the camera needs it. It asks you to open. I hate when the flashes keep popping and opening without my consent. And also it is one more feature to break somewhere down the line. I like the idea of just opening the flash myself.In the end. It is a little bigger than the models my wife wanted, but being an amateur photographer herself she didn't need much time to see that, for a few fractions of inches more, we had a better deal.Oh. I almost forgot. The biggest problem, really, is the downtime between shots. These cameras need to be faster. It makes me crazy when I need to take a shot and I just have to wait while the microprocessor is working. Come on, guys. You can make it better.Other than the speed issues... Great package.

Deck", "ReviewID": "R3LYFEFANV468F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Whether you are an experienced DSLR owner (as I am) looking for a compact second camera or you are someone looking to upgrade from your old point-and-shoot digital camera, the Canon PowerShot SX100IS is a well designed compact camera that has a lot of rich features at a very reasonable price.I've been using my Canon Digital Rebel (DSLR) for several years and am very pleased with it.  However, I have become increasingly aware of how bulky it is, particularly when I want to go places where it's inconvenient to lug around - like going hiking.  So I set out looking for a smaller pocket-sized camera that had as many features as I could find comparable to my DSLR.Being a fan of Canon cameras I limited the field to the PowerShot G9, the PowerShot Pro Series S5 IS, and the PowerShot SX100IS, all Canon products.  The G9 is promoted and priced as the best of Canon's non-DSLR cameras, although from the reviews I've read it is more appreciated for its look and feel than for its performance.  It is an 12.1MP 6x optical image stabilized zoom camera that can shoot RAW images.  In comparison, the SX100IS is an 8MP 10x image stabilized zoom camera that doesn't shoot RAW.  (I've shot RAW using my DSLR and don't find it necessary to get great photos.) The SX100IS has almost all of the other features of the G9, is about the same size, but weighs a lot less.The S5 IS is an 8.0MP 12x optical image stabilized zoom camera.  It looks a lot like a DSLR but doesn't allow for swapping lenses, and it can't shoot in RAW.  It has very similar features to the SX100IS but is considerably bulkier and weighs more.Even though all 3 cameras live up to Canon's reputation for taking great shots, I chose the SX100IS over the G9 because it had a higher optical zoom capability, weighed a lot less and was about $200 cheaper.  I chose SX100IS over the S5 IS because it is more compact and lighter, and is about $80 cheaper.  (Also, the SX100IS' 10x optical zoom is pretty amazing in its own right.)The SX100IS has almost as many features as the other 2 cameras at a considerably lower price.  I particularly like the Macro setting (which allows me to take really close-ups shots of ferns and the like on my hikes), and I like the manual focus capability for when the situation is such that the auto focus won't work properly.  Also, I find that the lack of a viewfinder isn't bothersome.  In fact, in some instances like when I'm playing around with white balance, I can get a preview of how the exposure changes on the 2.5\" LCD screen, which isn't available on my DSLR.Since purchasing the SX100IS about a month ago, I find myself reaching for it more often than I do my DSLR.  For my money and for most of my needs, this camera is superb.", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Just what I was looking for", "Author": "Myron R. Grover Jr.", "ReviewID": "R1IQS7XQJ20RS5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used this camera for one month and will comment on my observations.  First the zoom lens is superb.  It works smoothly and is easy to operate.  I use it all the time.  The pictures at full optical zoom (10X) were crisp, detailed and clear.  The color was bright, warm and true to life.  I found myself saying, \"Wow, wow, wow. I can't believe how great these pictures look \".  They are superior to the ones I take with my Canon S2 1S.  One brght and sunny day, I took some pictures of a near by river and pedestrians who were at least 100 yards away.  I used the digital zoom to enlarge the pictures 40X.  They were surprisingly good..again couldn't believe it.  However, on a gray day this was not the case.  The pictures were pixilated and of poor quality.  However, the 10X optical zoom pictures were always excellent.  The superb image stabilization system contributed greatly to the quality of the zoomed pictures.  My Canon Powershot  SD 1000 is a wonderful pocket sized camera but at times frustrated me because it only has 3X optical zoom without image stabilization.The macro setting of the SX100 IS is superb and easy to use.  The picture quality caused more \"Wow, I can't believe how good they are.\"  Some of my most exciting pictures have been in the macro setting.The camera is small enough to fit in my pants pocket albeit with a noticable bulge.  I have been carrying it this way for the past month even though I have a carrying case for it.  I wanted a camera with a decent zoom lens to carry with me on most days.  It works but it is definitely not as portable as the Canon Powershsot SD 1000.  I don't mind the increased size because I love the zoom.  Thus far the unprotected LCD screen has not been damaged in my pocket.  The screen itself is good size, easily cleaned and scratch resistant.  The screen in no way reproduces the fine quality of the pictures as seen on a computer or when printed out.  The screen has fewer pixels than the SD 1000 screen.  This is not a problem for me.  There is no viewfinder but the screen works reasonably well for me in bright sunlight.The camera has a solid feel which I like and is relatively easy to hold steady for zoom shots.  The battery and SD card cover at first felt a bit fragile but on repeated use it seems to work just fine.The movie function is average at best.  The low resolution movie setting takes poor quality movie that are unacceptable to me.  At the high resolution setting the movies are o.k.  You can zoom during a movie but it goes out of focus.  If I want a close up movie shot, I zoom first in the camera mode and then switch to the movie mode and shot the movie.  The results are o.k.  My  Canon S2 1S zooms while shooting a movie whichI like.I have not used the manual controls so I can't comment on them.  I have use the programed shooting modes for evening and inside shooting etc and they work just fine.This is a great camera albeit not perfect.  For me, the picture quality is it's greatest asset.  It is a pleasure to give it a 5 star rating.", "Date": "November 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great camera, price and features", "Author": "David Clucas", "ReviewID": "RUI875GN7LMN4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for the pro/am shooter that wants a little, but sturdy camera around.  I normally shoot with a Canon Mark II, so I'm sometimes reluctant to shoot with smaller cameras, but this is a great deal for the price and features.First off, understand that no point-and-shoot will ever match the quality of an SLR... but as far as point-and-shoots go this is one of the better ones.The top feature so far to me is the image stabilization.  Absolutely amazing.  With decent support I can take shots at 1/8 shutter speed and still come out with a clear shot.  It's so much better than sacrificing picture quality with a higher ISO.Second plus is the price.  At around $250 the SX100IS is as good as the Canon A640 and about $100 less.  The A640 is 10mp, 4x zoom and has a flip screen, but the SX100IS has 10x zoom to trump it.  8mp is all you need in a camera like this.  Don't get me wrong, the A640 is a great camera, but the SX100IS is the better deal.Everything else is what I've come to expect from Canon and more. Much better manual controls -- the scroll wheel makes it simpler to change settings.  A wide variety of ISOs from 80 to 1600.  Good face recognition technology.The SX100IS falls short in only one area... the flash.Before I get to the negatives, the great thing about the flash is that it doesn't pop up automatically, and yes that's a good thing.  I like this because it's simple -- flash down, it will not fire.  Flash up, it will fire. No fumbling around for the flash button, no unexpected flash in the museum, etc.  It's a very common-sense approach. Kudos to Canon for believing that their customers aren't complete idiots and that they don't need an automatic flash.Where the flash disappoints is in performance.  First, as usual, it over powers on most close up people shots, whiting out faces.  This is at least correctable by dialing down the flash power in the function options.Red-eye is another problem I always seem to have with Canon point-and-shoot flashes. I don't think the red-eye reduction feature works at all.There also seems to be a little delay when using the flash.  Not that this isn't the case with other point-and-shoots, but this one seems a little longer than normal.Finally, the automatic color processing with the flash doesn't compensate enough for the flash.  Pics look a little blueish.  It's not too bad, but again I've seen better.So this camera gets a 4 out of 5 because of the flash issues, but if you're mostly shooting without flash (and with that great image stabilization, you can shoot a lot more no-flash) then it'd be 5 out of 5.", "Date": "November 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great combination of capability and ease of use", "Author": "Jason L \"geek\"", "ReviewID": "R22KVED0VVDCCF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PROS: Great controls that are easy to use, lightweight, simple to operate and not at all intimidating like many more expensive \"advanced point-and-shoot\" cameras.CONS: Despite quality, there is some appreciable picture \"noise\" at the highest resolutions. This is a minor issue as it is to be expected in a camera this inexpensive.I purchased this camera yesterday based on reviews of this camera and similar cameras I found here on Amazon, but I felt that this model didn't have enough reviews going for it.First of all, the SX100 is a good size and the controls are easy to use, especially when compared to similar cameras in the \"advanced point and shoot\" category.While the camera is fairly large when compared to newer \"sleek\" cameras that are so popular right now, when I compare this camera to the Canon Powershot A40 that I'm replacing, it's a little bit smaller and MUCH lighter. Furthermore, when you compare the size of this camera to Canon's upper-end models and competitor's cameras in the same segment, the SX100 is quite a bit smaller.The controls are excellent - firm, crisp, and very logical. I doubt anyone will have difficulty figuring out all of the camera's basic functions. The controls are one of the best aspects of this camera. The competing cameras I tried had a lot of buttons and they were intimidating. I'm sure that I'd figure those out too, but I like the idea of knowing how to use a camera in 30 seconds (easier to explain to people taking pics for me, my girlfriend, etc.).The movie feature works quite well, but like all camcorders an external mic is required to get halfway decent sound. Still, for the money, it's a great added feature.As far as the zoom feature goes, it's solid. 10x isn't enough for me (I don't know what would be), but it's quite a bit better than most digital cameras on the market. It was enough to get a decent picture of a person standing over 60 feet away. It should work well for my purpose of taking decent photos at sporting events.If I had to make one complaint, it would be that there is some \"noise\" present at the highest resolutions. It's quite a bit better than a cheaper 5MP camera I've used in the past, but it doesn't compare to the image quality from an SLR. This is a minor complaint, simply because most cameras in this segment (and for this price) have some picture noise.To sum it up, I'd recommend this camera to anyone looking for a quality point and shoot who doesn't need or want the features of an SLR. If you're really interested in total control, lots of buttons, a \"shoe\" for mounting external flash, mic, etc., this isn't your camera. For everyone else who just wants to take pictures, go for it.

I haven't been disappointed.  I've taken it on trips to San Francisco and China and it performed flawlessly.  I took about 75 pictures before I had to swap the rechargable batteries I'm using (Energizer sells a nice 120/240V collapsible charger with 4 2300 mAh rechargable AAs for about $15).  I haven't used all the features but made good use of the manual mode settings for night photos of the Golden Gate.  I had to deal with camera shake at high zoom levels but that is a problem with any lens above 200mm.As expected, digital noise begins to show up at ISO settings above 400.  If the lighting is good the processing time is short.  However, processing is a bit longer in low light conditions.In general the controls are logically placed, the buttons are not too small, and the menus are easy to follow.  I find the scroll dial on the rear a bit clumsy.  Occasionally, I push too hard and make a selection by rocking the dial rather than scrolling.I added a SanDisk 2Gig Ultra II memory card with the USB feature and highly recommend it.I was looking for a camera that I could use in Auto when I don't have the time or desire to compose a shot but offered the option of manual controls.

There are plenty of cameras with viewfinders and plenty of them without. If you really want a high end Canon with a viewfinder, stop reading and go look at the G9, the S5IS, or the A650. Most people who shoot with this type of camera don't even use them, and for people with strong glasses prescription, like myself, they are so small they are absolutely useless. With a P&S; viewfinder, you don't even get the true picture. What's actually going on the sensor is what's on the LCD. The new models are so bright you can see them in almost any light. Most even have way to boost the display if needed. Viewfinders are a nice feature but only one of many.I have tried out this camera in stores and plan to buy one. The scroll wheel makes it very easy to adjust settings, like to change ISO for example. Ergonomically, it's large and curvy, like a mango, very comfortable to hold, even if you have big hands. The buttons are big and in the right places. It isn't small enough for a shirt pocket, but it is still quite portable. It has a large sensor, which means those pixels are bigger and hold more color information, giving you better pictures. My only gripe is that it doesn't start at 28mm (wide angle); that's not a deal killer, but for indoor, family shooting, I'd prefer Wide to 8x over Normal to 10x. Most people would take 10x over Wide. Teens and Twens looking something sleek & sexy to take clubbing, this isn't it; the SX100 is sensible shoes in a stylish world.I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a easy to use point & shoot that takes great pictures; to anyone who wants a P&S; than can do manual/aperture/shutter priority but can live without RAW; to anyone with a touch of arthritis/carpal tunnel or anything else than makes gripping and manual dexterity a challenge; and to those who really want a G9 but can't justify the extra $200.", "Date": "October 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "The PERFECT camera!

I was looking for something easier to use, more compact and lighter than the S3. I've studied the Canon cameras, read a lot of reviews and settled for an A550, but I wasn't very sure. I've discovered the SX by mistake, while visiting an electronics store. I was amazed by the clarity of the pics and the lightness, compared to the S3. And the zoom... it's actually hard to give up a 12x optical zoom like the one the S3 has, and that quality of images. But the SX proved to be a good choice. Reviews generally criticised the inacceptable noise at 1600 and the poor movie quality. I do agree about the ISO 1600, but movies seemed quite nice and the pictures are good even compared to the S3, although night isn't SX's best friend.I recommend the SX100 for those who want something more than an A camera, but don't like the bulky feel of an S3 and need something portable and more friendly-user. Otherwise, go and buy an S3 or an S5, their quality in pics is better and the price is almost the same.All in all, I'm happy with my little SX and thanks Amazon for the order. 4 stars from me - because night and ISO 1600 are poor and reaching for the USB port ain't very easy", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Mega Zoom", "Author": "William S.

Canon seems to have played a delicate balancing game with this one -and hit upon a winning strategy. The camera's big points are great image quality at ISO 200 or less, IS for steady images all the way extended, a usable high ISO (not great, but usable - especially if you have something like noise ninja), light weight, AA batteries, and a video mode. Another bonus is a general Canon bonus, they do very little in the way of image processing in camera so the higher iso photos, while not as good as the lower, respond better to post processing than cameras that do a large amount of in camera noise reduction. The facial focusing is really a nice feature and the auto focus is lightening fast - I was quite impressed.If you know the Canon UI, the SX100 is simply a wonderful refinement of it. Setting anything is almost completely intuitive. now if you do have big hands, the scroll wheel may be a problem, but that's about the only flaw that I could see - and for me, that wasn't even an issueThe downsides would be that there isn't RAW processing - but for a cheap camera, this isn't unexpected. The video doesn't let you zoom as its shooting - for that you'd need the S5, the wide end isn't all that wide, and higher iso isn't all that great (but better than other point and shoots (if you want quality here, you are looking at dSLRs) - and really those are the main downsides - all trade-offs I was willing to make.At the end of the day, if the iso is less than 200, you'll get great photos.

The sharpness and color rendition are fine for my unprofessional eye, and among its features I really like the ability to \"downgrade\" an already taken shot to a lower resolution; saves space while giving you an option of still keeping this \"not so great, but...\" picture.My major concern was the batteries: how many should I carry? I started with two Energizer Li batteries, which I get cheaply in bulk at the Sam's Club. After a week of vacation and more than 300 shots on highest resolution/largest size, many taken with flash, I still didn't need to change batteries! This leaves my Canon rechargable battery pack unused and unopened.\"Facial recognition\" works great if faces are big enough and subjects are directly facing camera. I use it to see whether anyone's eyes are closed on the picture - it's much faster than usual scrolling and zooming.Macro mode works great - so much better than in smaller Cannon cameras!Image stabilization: I did not notice much effect of it, especially with higher zoom, but I didn't test it specifically.To me, this camera is a great transition from the credit card-sized point-and-shoot-and-email-it cameras to something different, which might eventually help me to make prints worth hanging on the wall.", "Date": "February 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Happy", "Author": "a customer", "ReviewID": "R361H82OAHET96", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought a Powershot A570 to replace an old A510 and had to send it back. It had full manual controls, which  I liked, and it took pretty good pictures, but the the build quality was horrible. The zoom was jerky and it just didn't feel or sound like a very healthy camera.This SX100, however, is another story. It is solid, the zoom is smooth as can be and the LCD is a lot crisper than the A570. Plus the picture quality even seems a little better.My only complaint is when you screw a tripod mount to the camera it covers the battery cover. I nearly always use a tripod and I don't store my camera with the batteries in it so when I want to take them out I have to take the tripod mount off too. But this is relatively minor and I'm sure I can get used to it. While it certainly has enough manual controls to be used by the professional, most people will probably just use it as a point and shoot anyway so this wouldn't be much of an issue.If you are thinking of going with the A570, and you can possibly swing it, I would recommend spending the extra money for the SX100. The trade-off you get in quality is worth it. Most retailers are getting $300 for it, but I bought mine from Adorama for $235 plus shipping.

I like trees, and they basically stand still.But once I had my kids, and the digital age set in, I had to pack up my old SLR and get with something that could keep up with them.I first owned a polaroid of some sort that took a hundred years to download, and had no room for memory expansion...  Held about twelve pictures, and also, stank. So I bought a nice Pentax Point and shoot and kept dragging rolls of film in for awhile.I finally took the plunge when the 5mp cameras came out and bought a samsung digimax.  Hm... It served a purpose and took good outdoor shots.  Lots of red-eye and taking any photos in flourescent light was forbidden.I had a few other play cameras, like an oregon scientific, and some other pocket pix ones and decided to look around this year.After lots of shopping, I settled on the Canon that you are now looking at.What a camera.Here are the features I was looking for.1. Picture clarity.  You can have all the megapixels you want but that does not make for a clear picture... there are a lot of other factors involved.2. Versatility, (as in I can take pictures inside and outside, of moving objects and such without blurring, light problems, etc...)3. Small-  I dont want to drag around a giant camera.  I take my SLR with me with all the lenses if I wanted to do that.4. The zoom has to actually work.  I mean-- a lot of zoom is great, but not if the picture always looks like a colorful cloud-- This camera has image stabilizing, and it WORKS5.  I wanted the camera to take a picture RIGHT when I clicked... My samsung had the nasty habit of waiting around seven years of me holding the button down until the red eye and many other factors were done \"warming up\" before actually taking a picture.  Needless to say, there was never an option for a candid shot.... Lots of photos of the back sides of people though, and peoples faces right after something happened...So, The Canon has it all.  For years, Canon has been working to make photography easy for dorks like meTHe image stabilizer works amazingly.The images are sharp.The camera is small and light weight.The red eye reduction works all the time.The face finder rocksThe Zoom comes out with clear pictures-within reason anyway-shots with and without a flash come out wonderfully and well lit whether or not I use the flash!The camera can take picture after picture with virtually no rest period, and no warm up time.Here is what I found out and was surprised by, and LOVE!Switching to different modes is easy, totally self explanatory.This beautiful little camera uses batteries VERY conservatively.My old camera took maybe.... 60 shots before I had to replace the batteries, and I should, God forbid, take a film with this camera, I dont have to stop and replace the batteries after three minutes of filming.On the two energizer lithiums, (batteries I used in my last camera too) I have taken two hours worth of film shorts, about three hundred and fifty photos and I have turned it on at least 20 times to go through the photos and used it like a brag book.  Now, the battery says empty, but it is still going strong.  So, when you get this, dont change the batteries the second you lose all your bars.... You have a good few hundred pictures left on it.I am SO happy with this camera.  The price is just icing on the cake.I only got it a month ago, for the holidays, and I have just been trialing it....

Plus it's just the right size; lightweight, but well sized and shaped so that you can get a good grip on it (unlike the Elphs).In testing it out I've found that the camera's normal color saturation setting is a little lower than I like it to be, but you're able to adjust the color saturation to your own preference, so with Vivid, I'm producing lovely photos.I'm also so impressed with the number and power of features. The camera can sense its orientation and adjusts the display when you turn it sideways. It also uses this orientation sensor to record which side of an image is the real top... with this camera, it's virtually impossible to take a picture that needs to be manually rotated after shooting.Similarly, I wanted to test the in-camera red eye correction feature, but found that the anti-red-eye feature is so good I couldn't intentionally take a photo with red eyes... believe me I tried.The image stabilization feature works incredibly well. I shook the camera intentionally to test it, and it still took a photo that was sharp and unblurred. This feature would be very useful in dark settings or for people whose hands shake.The level of detail on the photos is stunning.

I was looking for a very portable camera (but not credit card sized) to take decent pictures - something to compliment my 35mm film SLR. Recently I went to the San Diego Wild Animal Park and figured this would be a good test of the camera. I was pleasantly surprised at how great the pictures came out. Usually I end up doing a little color correction on my digital photos but I will hardly have to touch the over 100 shots I took. I brought them into work the next day to show people and EVERYBODY kept asking me what was the model and make of my camera.The images are crisp and clean. The digital zoom works wonderfully and you can get some very clean closeups. I was able to get head and shoulder shots of a cheetah over 500 feet away. The image stabilization worked well. I took a few shots of some animals in a slowly moving vehicle. I fully expected the images to blur but they didn't. The only thing I didn't test was the video capture mode but I expect it to work well from what I found.One slight warning for anyone that plans to use the stitch assist (for panorama shots.) My previous camera had this feature and it assembled the photo as you went along (creating a very small picture in a small LCD on the camera back.) This camera assembles the pictures in your computer once you get back and download them ... but it does it much easier. Before you had to line up the pictures in the small LCD screen. With this camera you just have to get it close and the software will line it up automatically. Both cameras show the previous picture taken so you know where to line up the next shot but this time the software just asks what order the pictures were taken (which I guess means you can take them out of order) and then you click assemble and they all line up. It is quite easy.I would highly recommend this camera for anyone interested in a very portable camera.

It takes extremely sharp detailed pictures, which can easily be cropped and blown up and still retain their quality. The zoom is great, 10x optical and 40x if you add the digital zoom, although i normally wont go past the optical unless there's good lighting. It takes great pictures both indoors and out, but when indoors you will have to use the flash very often, unless the room is well lit.The video quality is not the greatest, but a very nice feature to have. You can zoom optically before you hit record, but can only zoom digitally while recording. The battery life with AA Alkaline batteries is very poor but with NiMH Recharbales it's great. I only get about a half hour of on time and 30 pictures off of one set of Alkaline batteries. Take everyones advice and get 2 sets of NiMH Rechargeable batteries off the bat they work wonders. I get over 200 pictures and several hours of on time from one charge. I bought Sony Quick Battery Charger with 4 AA Ni-MH Rechargeable Batteries as a pack and works great. The camera is very self explanatory and easy to use out of the box, and with a little reading the advanced options are easy enough to get the hang of. Some people were saying that when you change memory cards the batteries fall out, but that hasn't been an issue, if u get a large 2G or 4G sd card you wont have to change them very often, and just be careful. The one and only thing i don't like about this camera is the long delay between shots when using the flash. When using the flash it takes 5-8 seconds to recharge before you can take another shot.

All we wanted was a relatively nice point and shoot, but ended up with so much more!  I upgraded to the Canon SX100IS from an old Olympus.  I liked the Olympus, but love the Canon.  I looked at the ELPH series for their compact size, but was disappointed with their meager zoom.  I decided to forego the slim design for a better lens and have been impressed every step of the way!!  I've mostly taken photos on the auto setting, but also messed with the speciality settings, i.e., night shot, beach, snow, etc.  Taken numerous movies, inside and out.  Everything has turned out way better than expected.  Clear as a bell.  I caught a photo of a coyote on the north coast bluffs of Santa Cruz at an estimated 50 yards with the 40X digital zoom and could not believe my eyes at the image quality.  Definitely like the manual flash - wasn't sure if I would, but realized just how often I had to turn the flash on our old camera OFF to get a decent shot.  The Image Stabilization system seems to work very well.  The face recognition system is great too...easy to turn off if you don't want it.  All settings and menus easy and user friendly even for a novice like myself.  I really like the software that came along with it too - way better than iphoto.  I have tried using some of the camera's SLR characteristics like manual focus and shutter speed and that's pretty easy too, though I'm sure someone with more experience could make better use of those features.  Pretty durable...I dropped it and freaked out that it was ruined, but it didn't even get a scratch and works perfectly.  Really like that it takes regular AA's - in a pinch, you can find batteries anywhere.OK, so it can't be ALL positive, right?  Well, if I must pick a few things I don't like, one would be the function selector wheel - it's sometimes hard to turn it without pushing it's buttons too, if that makes any sense.  I've resolved that issue by just not using the wheel, but just using it as a button.  The fact that it only has 2 AA batts is nice for weight, but not so nice for longevity.  I did experience a couple of blurry action shots of people sledding down a hill, but most were fine...I think it was just user error.  That's about it for negatives.Overall, my experience with this camera has been beyond expectation.

Settled on this one due to the balance offering of 10x zoom (who's image stabilizers REALLY do work!), 8mp, face detection, video capabilities, ample shooting programs (kids and pets, snow, night snapshot, and stitch assist), all at a reasonable price.  I have a Sony handycam that gives me much grief (has 20x zoom and an image stabilizer that deteriorates significantly at it's maximum usage).Other nice-to-have features on this camera is the camera orientation detection which means it automatically adjusts (re-orients) itself when you want to take taller shots (turning the camera on it's side).  In addition to face detection, there is also the face selector which lets you pick a primary face to focus on.  Image depth and clarity is amazing at 8mp, provides pictures that more true-to-life and perfect for cropping or enlarging.Canon's non-proprietary output formats (.JPEG picture format and .AVI video formats) are highly compatiable with every video editing software available, which unlike some Sony products (.VOB video file formats), makes using this camera and it's outputs easy, affordable, flexible, and just plain fun!My only \"gripe\" is the memory, which is really two fold (1)that Canon doesn't offer internal backup memory...all images are stored on the meager 16mb memory card (included in the purchase) and (2)that Canon couldn't afford to offer at least a 1GB memory card included with purchase.  The 16mb only holds 3-4 images (depending on your subject complexity).  I plan to maximize this little camera's capabilities, not just for still images but for video as well, so I've opted for the maximum available memory of the new 16GB SDHC Class 6 memory card.  At the very least, one will need to purchase at least a 1GB, otherwise you will need to stay close to your computer to clean your card after every 4 shots.Overall, the camera is super easy to use (both on the front end and on the back end) and when one wants to take spur-of-the-moment shots, this camera is johnny-on-the-spot.

I purchase the Canon PowerShot SX100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom online to make it harder on myself to return the camera if I was not happy with it. LOL.

That Friday night, I closed my eyes tightly and click on the final link to make the purchase of the Canon PowerShot SX100IS official and banned myself from going back into the order to cancel it. I was never so nervous about an electronics purchase. Three days later on Monday afternoon, I lifted the cancellation band and decided that I was going to check the order to see if it can be cancelled. Lo and behold, the item had already shipped that Saturday morning and was to be delivered the next day on Tuesday morning. I said to myself, \"Rats! It's too late to cancel\", but I can always return it if I do not like it. I studied the return policy just in case. However, since I have received the camera, I have taken over 1,300 pics. Yes, that was not a typo, I really do mean over one thousand three hundred pics. The camera is amazing. In all those pics, I would have to say I was not happy maybe 4 of the pics (no fault of the camera, might I add) and deleted them. You guys! Even my 7-yr-old use this camera.

Let me save you a lot of trouble in your decision-making process. I love this camera and will highly recommend it to you. The pics are crisp and clear not matter where (inside or out) I take the pics. Without a doubt, one of my best electronics purchases!! You'll be happy with it too!!!!I am not employed by Canon nor do I have any affiliations with Canon. Come to think of it, maybe I should send them this review of the camera and ask them for a check.

The fact that the flash will only work when manually lifted up is one of the best assets of the camera! No more need to fight against the annoying pop out flash!I also need to mention that the camera took a bad fall; it was unintentionally dropped by a close relative. Since I had previously owned a camera that suffered a similar fate and stopped working afterwards, I feared that this camera would suffer the same consequences after the fall. However, to my surprise, the camera kept working with no flaws!The video quality is very good, with sound, and you can zoom in and zoom out during the recording. The macro works great as well as the manual controls. The camera is flexible enough to use it as a point-and-shoot as well as a professional camera. The zoom is flawless and even at the maximum zoom levels the pictures turn out without blurs! The digital zoom can be turned off therefore minimizing the chances of getting grainy pictures.I could keep going with a list of good stuff! If there is anything I could criticize is the fact that when you turn the camera on and off the lens makes a slight noise when coming in or out. There is also a slight noise when zooming in or out and I was concerned that would show in the videos, but no, the zoom noise is not apparent.In summary if you want good optics, great zoom capabilities, flexibility between point-and-shoot and manual features, and an affordable price the SX100IS is for you.", "Date": "January 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon SX100", "Author": "Dabs", "ReviewID": "R25ZXRXOHO3E9R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera takes exceptionally good and clear pictures.

We were previously using a Canon PowerShot S30 (3.2 MP) for many years, and it was time for a new one. Of course, considering our old camera, any modern camera would be an improvement, but this one in particular is fantastic for many reasons. I have large hands, and hate the puny \"cigarette pack\" cameras with the tiny buttons. This one is large and the side grip (on the right side of the camera while holding it) is very comfortable and secure - even though it has a wrist strap I know I'll never drop it. Add to that that I've taken several photos and movies with it without even opening the instruction manual, I'm very happy with it. I believe after reading the manual I'll be able to do almost anything with it. Perfect camera for the casual, \"point and click\" user.More pluses: Uses AA batteries (I use rechargeables but you could use ordinary batteries if you get stuck on a trip for example), takes SD memory cards (very common, all modern PCs, printers, and even some TVs use them), takes great digital mini-movies (about 100meg per minute, with a large SD card you can take respectable home movies)On the minus side, obviously this is intended for the casual/novice user, makes a great family camera, but of course if you're a pro you'll want something more (and probably wouldn't be reading this anyway). It doesn't have a viewfinder, but I certainly don't miss it, the screen is large and bright. Also, if you're looking to put this into your pocket, it won't fit, so you'll need a small camera bag.The only real problem I had with this was when I made a movie of my son's ninth birthday party, the candles caused an odd reflection in the movie - probably something to do with the lens. He ended up with 9 little dots around his face, even though the cake was in front of him. Not a real big deal, it came out kind of cool.Bottom line: Strongly recommended for family use or if you're looking for a great value for the money. Having owned a Canon before this new one is great and I know I'll buy Canon again when it's time to replace this camera.

I actually bought a Kodak Easyshare Z812IS 8.2MP Digital Camera first but was disappointed with it.  There is a lag between pressing the button and the photo being taken.  Especially when you have young children this is a deal breaker!!!  They would often be heading out of the shot by the time the photo was taken.  Also the book that came with the Kodak camera was really minimal - you were instead supposed to go to the website and download the guide book.

Here are my pros and consProsLarge view finderComplete and in-depth guide book included with cameraSharp, clear photos10x optical is wonderful - you can get great  closeups without moving close to subject.  Also for portraits you can throw the background out of focus with a long zoom in.  (A long optical zoom is one of the most important features to have on your camera - the longer the better.)Face recognition is quite useful.

I was able to capture moving subjects in Auto mode in low light condition a good 90 percent of the time.  This is impressive for a point-and-shoot camera and I would be even more impress if the flash recharge time can be reduce from the 7 to 8 seconds delay.  I've tested the macro feature as well and find it very impressive.I like the large 2.5 LCD display which makes composing and viewing results so much more enjoyable.  The video quality is amazing, yes even for indoor shows.  I also like the zoom control position conveniently right next to the shutter but it could be more accurate.  I think the amazing attractive price point makes it truly a compelling buy.  The only aspect that I don't like is the part that everyone else has pointed out, that is, the memory card is in the battery compartment now.  That is just a warp design, so I have to resort to transfering pictures using the provided USB cable instead of taking out the memory card.

Its most distinctive feature is a 10x zoom of the usual Canon quality. It appears intended to compete with the Panasonic Lumix TZ series. Compared to the TZ, it is larger and heavier, but it does have a pop-up flash which can offer slightly better modeling and, more important, for many photographers, a manual exposure mode. Canon apparently intended the SX100 to fill what they perceive as the \"gap\" between the venerable (and excellent) A series and the DSLR lookalike, but not function alike, Powershot S5, which is also excellent.  The SX100 has, in my opinion, one major design flaw. Instead of the more typical 4-way touch mechanism for function selection, the SX100 has a rotating wheel. This is, again in my opinion, a massive error since the wheel is very difficult to rotate accurately: fingers tend to slip off and either set a function prematurely or hit another button bringing up an unwanted function or, worst of all, both. Perhaps people with very small fingers and an acute sense of touch can reliably use this wheel. I cannot and see it as a major negative in the design of the SX100.  Other than that flaw - which I think of as a showstopper for many people - the camera is typical Canon, which means very good value for the money. The 8 Megapixel images are crisp. As always, except for very expensive DSLRs, noise becomes a problem at higher ISO values, in this case starting at about ISO 200. If the choice is between having no picture at all and a noisy picture, the decision is obvious.  The SX100 has face detection and it seems to work. The 2.5\" LCD viewfinder is okay. There are a few specialized scene selectors, such as beach scene and portraits.  In video mode, you can capture 640 x 480 video at 30fps. Audio quality is passable. But you cannot zoom while doing video. Up to one hour of video can be recorded.  The zoom range is 36 - 360mm. I wish all the manufacturers would lop off the top end and make the wide angle wider.  Shot to shot recyling times are a bit on the slow side, but not unusual for this class of camera. Flash recyling time is just plain awful and much slower than other similar cameras.  The camera runs on two AA batteries, which I consider a plus since such batteries are available everywhere in the world. But make sure you carry extras because this camera eats batteries. Rechargeables are a must with this camera.  Overall, this is a general purpose camera with no truly outstanding features. While image quality is high - and the primary reason for the 4-star rating - the rest of the camera is kind of ho-hum.

This camera has nearly the same pixels and zoom as a professional SLR camera at 1/3 of the cost. Research it, you will find it too. Another reason was because of the zoom capabilities. When traveling there are a lot of things across the bay or simply to far away to see clearly. Using this camera I was able to zoom (a total of 40X including optical and digital zoom combined) and take a perfectly clear picture. It was so amzing that several of my traveling companions and travelers around me exlaimed at it's quality and wrote down the type of camera I had. The pixels are great as well and allow even far away pictures to be taken with very little noise (or speckling). The size of the camera is comfortable as well. It's not small enough to stick in your jean pocket, but it's light enough to wear around your neck or stick it in a cargo pant pocket, or coat pocket. The flash is relatively good, it could be better. However, all my pictures came out wonderfully.

I was in the market to replace the subcompact Sony with a compact with a minimum 10x optical zoom and image stabilization to be used for both video and photos.  My choices came down to the Canon SX100IS, Sony DSC-H3 and Canon S5IS.The Canon S5 on Amazon was only $75 more than the SX100 and Sony, for a lot more features including stereo sound for movies, a flip out screen and 12x optical zoom.  In terms of bang for the buck, the S5 was easily the best deal.  But it was just too bulky to easily carry to concerts, and i thought it was overkill so ruled out the S5.So it came down to the Sony and SX 100.  Both were the same price, about the same size, with similar features.  Consumer Reports gave a good review to the Sony, but hadn't yet reviewed the Canon.  What pushed me toward the Canon was (1) the ability to zoom while recording a movie whereas the zoom on the Sony is locked while recording movies; (2) Canon uses all forms of SD cards including the new high capacity format, while the Sony uses proprietary Memorystick Duo.  But I was concerned about the battery life of the Canon versus Sony's longlife lithium  rechargeable battery.First test was at an outdoor festival concert.  Still photos were absolutely superb at all zoom lengths.  Note that in movie mode, you can only use the optical zoom prior to starting the recording.  Once recording starts, you can continue to zoom in or out using digital zoom.  I had to figure out how to focus the movies.  By default continuous focus is turned off (i guess to save battery life). I eventually figured out that i should lock subject into focus at the maximum optical zoom, hit record, and then i can zoom in and out using digital zoom with everything remaining in focus.  Once i figured out the focus part, the videos were crisp and clear, even using the digital zoom.  The audio was totally distorted and clipped because I was standing close to the  speakers, a problem that's endemic to most digital cameras which don't have microphone gain control.Next test was an indoor nighttime concert, same artist.  This time, I applied a homemade sound filter in the form of a fabric bandaid placed over the microphone.  Again, the videos were great.  The sound was totally acceptable, although understandably some of the high range was muffled by my filter.  The photos were great with flash.  I actually like the fact that the flash doesn't automatically pop up, and has to be manually flipped up.  That way the flash doesn't go off at an inopportune time, since most artists don't like flashes going off while they're performing.I recorded +/- 25 minutes of video and a handful of photos with each set of Duracell Ultra AA batteries, and changed the batteries before they ran low.  I don't know how long they would have lasted if i hadn't pre-emptively changed them.  But battery life has been a non-issue.So great photos, great videos, acceptable audio, reasonably compact.  4.5 stars.", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Overall Great Digital Camera", "Author": "Sean L.

So it could use a bigger memory card than the one that it comes with, but I haven't found it necessary.  The zoom seems to be good, but this is my first camera with this much zoom and settings. It does get more grainy/blurry once you get into the digital zoom (past 10x optical.)  Occasionally it hasn't done the best in low light, but is usually fixed by raising the flash or changing the settings. Some of the best photos I've taken are in the manual setting.  I've also used it to get photos of backyard birds and it sure beats the point and shooters I've used even with binoculars hooked to them.

Did a short video of the cat & dog and it came out great. Very easy camera to use. My first point & shoot was an Olympus Camedia which was only a 3 Meg. & 3 optical. Awesome camera but wanted something smaller. I was disappointed in the smaller Cannon A560. The Olympus took sharper pictures. I download into the CP and usually print my own. I seem to get better pix out of the larger cameras.....especially since we travel a lot and need the zoom. I will leave the pocket size cameras to the kids that don't seem to care about the optical. I am taking this one to Tahiti. Oh, battery life is good, but if you want to take movies need a lot more media card space. Think you get about 1 hr. on a 2GB card.

I couldn't hold it very securely because the power source/security device made it difficult to manage the menus and buttons.  Since I teach computers at the middle school level, I really wanted to get a camera with manual controls because, with a point-and-shoot, you're really only teaching composition.  The other option is a $600 entry-level DSLR.  So I got the SX100.I am so glad I did.  I was able to take great shots right out of the box.  There was no awkwardness with the manual controls, the pictures came out great, and indoor shots were just as fantastic as outdoor shots.  As someone else mentioned, pictures indoors with flash really aren't as good as pictures without flash.  The auto settings sort themselves out and produce really sweet images.Someone also mentioned trying to shake the camera to make a blurry picture.  I took this one step further.  I drove down the highway at 55 mph and took shots perpendicular to the line of travel.  They turned out crystal clear.One of the features I like is the button that lets you view previously taken pictures without turning on your camera. It is nice not to have the lens come out on startup.  Sure, you could turn the dial to the Play icon before you power up, but that's an extra step.  I really like the simplicity of the one-touch image viewing.  Also, to switch to camera mode, just press the shutter and you are ready to take pictures.

Although this camera has a far more powerful zoom and more SLR style features than a typical point and shoot, it is laid out in a way that allows the user to quickly switch between functions. Often used features that in other P & S cameras were only accessible through a menu are now located on function knob on the top of the camera. So, if you want to switch to the children & pets function you don't have to navigate through a menu. There is also a button specifically for deleting photos, which I liked alot. I was a little disappointed that there is no viewfinder, in case I wanted to save battery life, but the absence of the little used viewfinder did little to dampen my overall enthusiasm, and keeps the price down. Also, I was disappointed that there was no rechargeable battery setup, but this camera uses AA batteries very efficiently. So, why didn't I give this camera 5 stars? Because at the moment I can't judge its durability. If it's still functioning well in 3-4 years, I will issue the 5th star at that time. Unfortunately, my last Canon PowerShot was not as long lasting as I would have liked and the light sensor conked out after 3.5 years of, up to then, faithful service. My PowerShot before that started developing problems with the zoom lens after 3 years. This camera (SX110IS) with far more features and twice the zoom of those dinosaurs is also far less expensive coming in at a little over $200. So I'll stick with Canon for the lens and overall value.

I mean you could, but it's a little too bulky for that and I'd be afraid I'd drop it. Definitely a \"sir, will you take a picture of us?\" camera. Just make sure you put it on Auto before you hand it to a camera noob.Macro is probably the best feature on this camera. It's about all I use. Takes clear, beautiful shots and allows you to get a close shot without having to be up close. Though for me macro is never close enough.

Also anything not in the exact center of the image is slightly fuzzy.Battery life is pitiful. Regular AA batteries just don't cut it.

The 10X optical zoom feature is A MUST for close-up shots!!!Even open range and skyline photos (sunsets at the beach) were taken, with an awesome image definition!!!However, it's true that battery life is quite short, so don't forget to carry an 8-pack of fresh AA batteries everytime (specially, if you're planning a long trip with plenty of photo shooting).I really don't know if newer Canon models for this camera may have a better performance, even with larger megapixel capability. Really, I'm quite happy with this camera, and I would consider to change it only if I find a much better model in a really cheap price.

The LCD is big and bright, and I have not missed having a viewfinder yet.I use Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable AA NiMH batteries (2000 maH) in it and can typically shoot at least a couple of hundred pictures without flash or shoot a half-hour or so before having to swap to the backup set of batteries.The image stabilization works very well, although photo quality in very low light is not great.For normal picture taking the results are very good. The photos have good contrast and colors, and the auto-focus and face detection work well and don't get in the way of taking pictures.An interesting thing about face detection is that it detects eyes, human or not! So when doing a macro photo of some colorful leaf-hopper with the camera, the face detection is able to pick out the tiny insect eyes and focus on the insect face correctly.Photos using the flash tend to come out very well, and it takes a second to learn that you need to manually pop up the flash to make it work.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "excellent buy!", "Author": "Suzanne Seely", "ReviewID": "R3IBT4ITC1VT74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a great camera!

I took it to the photo supply dealer that sold it to me and the owner replaced the batteries which made no difference. He finally bumped the camera on his hand and the lens retracted. By November of '08, the camera would not focus at all and he sent it off for it's first repair which took about 3 weeks. The repair only had a 90 day warranty by Canon. In February, the camera begain to stop focusing again but I thought it was lighting/white balance at the car show where it was being used. By the end of march (more than 90 days later) it stopped focusing again. Canon made a \"good will repair\" with no warranty. Now, four months later (July) it has started to randomly fail to focus again and the lens rattles when focusing or zooming. I paid $399.00 for the camera.

I am into taking somewhat artsy photos, but am not fimilar with all the different settings and options it requires to take a great picture, so I thought this would be a great camera for me as it seemed pretty simply to figure out. I guess I was looking for something with similar features to a digital slr without the size (and price). I think this camera probably is compareable to that, but I feel like unless you really know what you are doing, or take time to memorize the manual, it is really hard to get what you are looking for when taking a photo. There have been several instances where I've had the manual out, testing out a setting, only to forget it the next time I use my camera. It was a little disappointing to say the least, as I would have liked to used this as a \"regular\" shot camera as well as some art type shots, but mostly have just used it for the latter.Another con to this camera is the flash takes rediculously long to recycle. I have used the camera a lot to take photos of friends and whatnot, and a lot of times you sit there for what seems like forever for the picture to actually be taken because the flash takes soooo long. Several times I have missed a great shot because of this, and it's really annoying when trying to take a photo of someone as they are standing there for so long waiting for the picture to be taken. It really makes it hard to capture the \"moment\" in a photograph.Besides my two complaints, overall this camera takes great photographs and video.

Also, it's not easy to shot good pictures at night or in the dark.  I had better success with the S3 at adjusting the exposure settings to shot clear and well balanced pictures at night.What I really like about the SX100 is the variety of shooting modes.  The fireworks mode works fairly well.  The aquarium mode is awesome and the foliage mode produces very vibrant pictures of vegetation.

I love the 10x optical zoom (along with the digital zoom you can go up to 40x zoom!).  But, at this high of zoom, it is sometimes difficult to find your subject in the LCD display (could benefit from a viewfinder).  Controls are similar to what I was used to with the old Canon.  I am getting excellent battery life out of a set of Duracel 2650mah NI-MH rechargeable batteries.I've been able to get excellent indoor and outdoor photos, and even experimented on some night time photos (have to play with the manual settings to get some decent night photos), and even took a picture of the full moon at 40x zoom -- it looks like your looking through a telescope!  The only problem I've had with blurred photos was when taking photos at high zoom in poor light.

A couple of notes about this product before you buy it though:(1) The flash does not come up automatically.  This may not seem like much, but sometimes when you're inside on AUTO and the flash doesn't go off because you forgot to flip it up, it is slighly frustrating.(2) It takes only 2 AA batteries.  This is good and bad.  Some previous camera with similar size and feature that I have had took 4 AA batteries and lasted longer.  This one takes only two and the battery life really just isn't that great.  And not having a viewfinder option to allow you to switch off the screen is unfortunate also.(3) It has some excellent electronic features too.

Keep it in Auto mode and it behaves like a high end point and shoot. Change the settings to time priority / aparture priority or complete manual to take pictures limited by just your own creativity.The pictures are AWSOME, AWSOME, AWSOME, the vibrancy / detail it captures is way ahead of my Fuji.Another nifty feature is the onboard movie recorder that can zoom in and out while recording (10x optical) and also record sound :).This virtually eliminates the need for a separate camcorder... unless you plan to really make home movies, which most of us don't have the time for. If you're anything like us, record movies during a vacation and then don't have the time to transfer those to a DVD or somethign, then this is again the ideal camera, you can upload the vides to youtube or any other site and then share with friends and family.Uses regular AA batteries, u need to make sure you're carring enough of. Budget for one set (2 AA) for each day of your vacation. Or you can get some rechargables if you want to save some money. My jury is still out on which is better Li-ion or regular AA, both have benefits. with Li-ion you need to remember to charge the battery each night and then carry the charger around anyway, just in case, with regular AA you need to carry a spare set in the bag.Oh the face detection, range finder and multi point TTL metering as also great features that make this camera the ideal bridge digital between a point and shoot and a DSLR without all the bulk and $$$ associated with a DSLR.", "Date": "April 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "love this camera", "Author": "Jordana Corenblum \"camera happy\"", "ReviewID": "R253F88AL3CIXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera 1 month ago and I haven't put it down.

On the upside, it can manual focus (I was surprised) and do many other things that my DSLR can do.  While most features are easy to use, on the downside, I spent some hours reading the thick manual to determine how to do uncommon things like lock the autofocus and exposure.  The manual is quite excellent, so I found out what I needed to know.  It just took some time.As compared to an old Canon DSLR, I found the following pros and cons.PROS:FULL-FEATURED for a power userLatest DIGIC III processorCompactVideoPrice (especially on Amazon)CONS:1-2 second lagtimesSensor noise is noticeable for ISO 400 and abovePlastic bodyThe Canon SX 100 will be my everyday camera to photography family and take in the car whereever I go.If you are interested, I posted a few shots on this Amazon website.

I imagine that if I were to take the camera with me somewhere were I wanted to actually use it I would need at least 2 or 3 sets of extra batteries.  It was quite surprising actually.2) The time between shots is way too long.  Depending on the battery life which was usually low, it took over 4-6 seconds between shots when the flash was enabled.3) The AF-assist/red-eye reduction light was blinding (when flash is enabled).  I took pictures of my family members and they said the light was way too bright and that maybe something is wrong with the camera.So for those reasons I returned the SX100 IS and bought a G9 which I am very happy with.", "Date": "January 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Definitely not for spur-of-the-moment shots.", "Author": "Minnesota Mom", "ReviewID": "R2LEU516SF9EZR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I drool over pictures that people take with SLRs, and I really wanted to be able to take pictures of that quality, but not spend the $600 to do it.  I thought that with this camera's manual settings that I'd be able to play a little bit.  Turns out it was too much fuss to take pictures of my kids.  If I was sitting outside with them, I could get crisp beautiful close-ups.  But inside the house in the later evening hours, I'd miss spur-of-the-moment shots.  The camera would tell me to lift the flash.  If I didn't lift the flash, the image was terribly blurry, which makes sense because the shutter was compensating for the lack of light.  But if I used the flash, it was terribly over-exposed.  And by the time I got the flash up, my daughter was already in the next room.  So anyway, I learned that while I love how pictures taken with an SLR or a semi-manual camera like this one look, I don't have the time, the patience, or kids who sit still long enough to get pictures of that quality.

Anyone can take great photos with this camera. I read all the reviews here and on internet camera sites and Consumer Reports and everyone had excellant things to say about the camera.  I wanted one of those tiny cameras, but when I went to the store and tried them, found that they were ackward to handle and didn't have anywhere near the zoom that this one has.  It is small enough to fit into a coat or pant pocket easily.  I like that it uses 2 AA batteries.  I went through about 180 photos with the original batteries and am now using rechargables (Sony).  Our friends bought the same camera after we did and they use lithium batteries and have over 500 photos on the first set of batteries. They love the camera too.  Do go out and buy a bigger memory card as the one that comes with the camera doesn't hold many photos.  Using the cables to connect to the computer was easy to do and downloading the photos simple as well.  We are in our Mid 50's and early 70's and still found it easy to do.  This really is a great camera for everyone.  My husband plans to learn how to use all the \"extras\" that the camera can do, but I'm more than happy with just using automatic and letting the camera do all the work.

This Canon Powershot SX100IS camera has been updated four times, the SX110, SX120, SX130, and SX150, since 2007, and all of them cost under $150 while this outdated camera is selling for $835.64, and that makes absolutely no sense at all. The technology got better with each update and now the SX150IS has 12x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom and 14.1 Megapixels, not to mention just about everything that was updated also.I hope no one ever goes for this SX100IS thinking it is the better SX camera just because it costs more. It was a good camera in it's day, but it just got better with each update. I would, however, based on my recent research for a new camera, suggest the SX130IS over the SX150IS for various reasons I won't go into here except to say the overall reviews for the SX150IS haven't been as good as the sx130IS. (there is not SX140IS) Want to save a few bucks, the SX110IS and the SX120IS are also very good cameras. I am shopping for a new camera only because my 110 got dropped and broken. I bought the 120 yesterday and I like it fine, but I think for just a few bucks I'm going to return it for the 130.I sometimes wonder what Amazon is thinking when they set their prices. All of the above mentioned SX cameras are priced better here than almost anywhere else, and Amazon includes free shipping at the moment.

The only reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the camera manual makes slight mention about RAW images even though on my camera i have had it come up saying RAW a couple of times on the screen for some of my images. Even though most people say it doesn't have the capabilities for it, Trust me i have had it say it a couple of times but i cannot remember how i got it to do it lol. This camera is great for getting quality photos and all the images are crisp and clean except for occasional noise within the photo, which only shows up by the way if you use the camera with a low battery. This camera however eats regular Alkaline batteries like mad so i would suggest buying a set of rechargable batteries unless you want to spend a fourtune. Even though it has no Veiw finder to look through the display works like a charm just as well. Even though it might be slightly expensive for people on a budget it is a really GREAT camera and it is worth buying. I have had no run ins with bugs or problems with it.
