All you need to do is connect the new dispositives in serie with the existing one; - I can call the control unity with my mobile phone and disarm the alarm before get home when I'm not with the remote control; - My phone rings within 9 seconds after the alarm is triggered; - The control unity saves a history with the time and sensor of the 5 last times it was triggered; - Works with 9V batteries;What I dislike: - Only one remote control; - Not very loud. I can barely hear it outside my apartment if the front door and the room door (where it is installed) are closed; Things get better if I install it close the door, but this way someone can easily smash it or unplug the phone cable in a few seconds. I'd rather to have an external siren; - Manual have two different procedures for remote operation of the alarm. The correct is the second one in the end of the manual where you should press a number + # to operate the control unity; - Extra accessories (especially the remote control) can be expensive and difficult to find; - Window/door sensor could be smaller; - There is a smal screw in the back of the control unity that entered inside it through a smal hole the first time I opened it to insert the battery. It was a pain to remove it later; - I'd like to have a keyboard outside home so that I can disarm the alarm without the remote control. - I didn't discover how to disarm zones without deleting the sensor from the control unity database;What was a plus (features not informed in the manual or in the product description): - Window/door sensor have a glass break detector. It triggers the control unity with impact; - WIndow/door sensor have a switch to locally play an alarm sound even if the control unity is not armed. - Control unity have 4 wire connections in the back: 1 for external siren and 3 triggers (1 normally closed and 2 normally open for extra sensors);*02/26/2011*After 6 months, the 9V battery of the motion sensors died. The battery of the window/door sensors are still OK.*6/17/2011*The control unity alerts you when the battery of the sensors are too low. If you don't fix, it can give false alarms.I removed the batteries from the motion sensors and connected to the 9V output in the control unity. Everything is working fine and I don't need to replace the batteries every 6 months anymore.*9/7/2012*After 2 years, the battery of the door sensor is still ok (have never replaced). The motion sensor batteries lasts 6-8 months.*9/28/2013*3 years and the original batteries of the door sensors are still ok... unbelievable!!", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very easy to install.", "Author": "Peter V.", "ReviewID": "R5H8HRHI0QSVV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I live in a not so great apartment complex. I have lots of nice toys that would be very easy to hock at a pawn shop. I got worried everytime I left my apt that I'd come back to find the flimsy door kicked in and my goodies gone. I was able to install this in minutes. Two screws for the main unit and one screen for the motion sensor (mounted right above my door but out of reach to the average person. Now I can leave my place without worry.Pro: Very easy to install, keychain remote means no running to the keypad.Con: I found the working range of the remote to be about 30ft (through several walls though). Its loud but without an external siren I'm counting on my immediate next door neighbors to respond to the alarm before they disable it. Some of the setup menus are a little clumsy, but you only have to do it once.I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very good for the price", "Author": "robert \"hiker person\"", "ReviewID": "R25FYO6JAQZPVZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review includes the Mace Home Security unit PLUS the optional external speaker.I bought this system about a month ago. It came with both an instructional DVD plus written instructions.  Both were fairly easy to follow. It may take a couple of tries on some of the items to be programed because it will revert back to the main menu if you take too long but this is not a problem. Making sure the detectors are properly set up is a must otherwise it won't arm properly. Make sure the door/window sensor is no more than 1/4 inch apart. If either is set up incorrectly it will tell you on the lcd to please close and gives the sensor number that's not correct (included motion detector is #1 and door/window sensor is #2).  It's wise to double check phone number entries,delay times,  etc upon completion. I have the door/window sensor located in my outdoor shop about 125 feet away past three walls from the main control and it works fine. I've used motion detectors before and they can be a problem since they will detect pets or even rodents.  It's best to locate them in narrow areas (such as  a narrow hallway) to minimize the risk of a non human triggering it. The alarm is very loud and can be heard throughout my house but since I live in a rural area and also wanted to protect my detached shop, I chose the external alarm.  I would say that when set up it may have an effective range of about 200-250 feet, depending on neighborhood noises. This hopefully would scare away intruders but not sure my neighbors (about 900 feet away) would notice it.My only complaint concerns the instructions.  During my initial set up I had problems arming the system and had to call customer support.  The instructions indicated that troubleshooting information was available on their website but there was none. I was able to get a troubleshooting guide from tech support and he indicated that hopefully this would be put on their website in the future.Also, the instructions for the external siren indicated there are three different  versions of software developed over the years that required different programing methods  and the serial number of the main control unit indicated which version I had.  This proved to be incorrect and again I had to call tech support to get the correct programing procedure. The good news is that Mick at tech support was excellent. He responded quickly to my calls and walked me through the couple of minor problems I had. For me, it's not just about a great price (I paid about $72 including shipping for the Home Security package and about $42 for the optional siren) but customer support and I rate both at A+. Again, my only problem was with the instructions and hopefully these will be corrected  by Mace. I decided it still earned 5 stars based on the great support they provided.I researched a number of alarm systems and found this unit to truly be an excellent buy based on it's quality and features and I'm very satisfied with it.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "nice basic system", "Author": "H.

Would have given it 5 stars if it had one additional feature.  When you activate a sensor while the unit is armed, it should give a warning, continuous tone for the 20 seconds before full alarm.  Sometimes we enter the home with groceries or something and go about our business forgetting that we have the security system on and trigger a full scale alarm.  This minor improvement would make this unit unbeatable!  I used several motion sensors in our home since we have 23 openings at ground level.

Did the trick, works well.OK, if your like me the most important thing is false alarms, I thought and thought about every other way this thing could be set off besides some one breaking in, I live alone, am 100% disabled, do not want to go to the store, come home to find my house surrounded by police (I have my unit set to call 911), guns draw, doors kicked in, well you get the picture.So, I did some experiments, you will not believe what the weakest link is, drum roll please, lol, it's the motion detector, you see, the detector works very well, to well. I wanted to test it so I hooked up a night light next to the motion detector, opened the front door and let 1 fly in, shut door, turned night light on and waited to see what would happen, bingo, the fly did not even have to land on motion detector lens, it triggered the alarm with the fly buzzing around in the air, what people must understand is a bug crawling across lens, a fly or what ever will trigger any motion detector.So in short to be 99.99% sure of no false alarms use door/window sensors only.

I did not see the exterior siren on the manufacturer's website.

I will start with the dialing the phones part since this was my main concern when I ordered.  Set is easy if you follow the directions.  I put in my cell phone number, my brother in law who is a cop, and my neighbors number along with a couple of more, and this system was ringing my cell phone within a second of being set off.  I then let it keep going and it dialed everyone perfect.  You can turn it off via your cell phone, listen in own the system, talk via the system and it comes with a card that you can put in your wallet to help you remember the codes.  The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is b/c the remote control chain for my key ring broke.(not the remote, just the chain)  For a unmonitored system and at less than a hundred when I bought it, this works great.  If you have a home with two doors, then this will work.  I put the door monitor on one door, and the motion detector in the room with the other door, and both have been working for over 3 months without having to change the batteries.

I had it up and running on all 6 sensors by 11PM the same day spending more time physically mounting the wireless sensors than programming the controller.I programmed the MACE Controller to call me on my cellphone and as I have a wireless sensor in the garage, I get a test call every time I park my car in the garage.  The controller is set for a 10 second alarm delay, so my cell phone rings with an \"alarm call\" from the Mace before the garage door finishes closing.  I disarm the MACE with the little remote while in the car.HERE'S MY SPECIFICS:PROGRAMMING:The programming is simple except for two items.1.  The programming steps in the manual are embedded within paragraphs instead of having them set out in a numbered table which makes following the steps somewhat confusing but not impossible.  The steps themselves are not that difficult. Just translating the steps to \"your own programming table\" would makes the process much simpler.2.  The programming sequence requires a waiting period of 20 seconds and 60 seconds (depending on what you're programming) after you enter your programming data.  You have to wait for the \"BEEP\" before you move on to enter other programming sequences.SENSORS:The sensors have really good horizontal coverage although the vertical coverage is slightly narrow.  I don't have any pets so I can't talk about \"kitty false alarms\" but I do know that when you enter the room, the sensors activate without the appearance of any dead spots.I've got sensors located all over the house and while the MACE controller is NOT centrally located, all sensors report accurately and faithfully to the MACE Controller.  All 6 sensors worked out of the box.  No problems.  The sensor mounts are inexpensive but they work well.INTERNAL SIREN:It's quite loud but your neighbors probably won't hear it.  I turned my siren function off so the bad guys can't find the MACE controler and rip it out of the wall.  I'd prefer that the Police find the bad guys engrossed in their work.THE REMOTE:My remote has a range of about 50 feet or so.  The security system is much easier to live with if you have multiple remotes. I have one in each car and one on the night stand.Incidentally, the MACE Controller programming window shows only one programming entry location for a remote.  however, you can program up to 10 remotes in that one location on the MACE Controller via \"The Learning Mode\".RECORDED VOICE MESSAGE:Easy to do.  The recorded voice which gets played during an \"alarm call\" to your programmed phone numbers is a little muffled, probably a low bandwidth recording, but it's sufficient for recognition and understanding during an \"Alarm Call\".MONITORING THE PREMISES FUNCTION:The microphone in the MACE Controller which is accessed by a \"1#\" from the \"answering phone\" during an \"alarm call\" is quite sensitive and it would be very easy to hear someone rummaging through your stuff via the monitor function in order to verify the validity of an alarm before making that Police Call.CONCLUSION:This is an inexpensive alarm system that works as promised and does a good job.  I no longer stress over home security when I'm out for a day or two.  It was money well spent.I rated the unit as 4 Stars.  It missed the 5 Star rating because of the messy programming manual.FULL DISCLOSURE:I used to configure Microwave Radios and Dantel Alarm Systems for AT&T; before I retired.", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not good", "Author": "m run", "ReviewID": "R3VLDRDM3QFNR4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this hoping to avoid paying more than I wanted to for an ADT alarm. My husband used to install alarms for a company, so we were confidant that he would be able to install this. He was. The problem is the alarm is cheep.  The key pad is not lit, this makes it very hard to see what is on the screen even in the day time. The number pad is louder than the alarm itself, and it takes about 2 full minutes to activate once you push in your code to \"arm\" the system.  On the second day of use one of the monitors fell off the wall breaking the wire and setting off the alarm in the middle of the night. The window contacts are useless if you want glass break protection, as they do not function this way. I would not purchase this system again. In fact I did return all of the extra contacts that I bought for the windows and just use the door system. Amazon has been great about taking the returns and replacing the broken contact, however it's just more trouble than it's worth. If you do buy this put the key pad where you want the alarm to be the loudest, as that is where most of the noise comes from. When the alarm went off in the middle of the night at my house the kids didn't wake up because with the doors closed to the rooms you can not really hear the system.

The unit called us around midnight and the instructions on how to disarm by phone didn't work.  Couldn't tell whether it was due to being woken out of a sound sleep or wrong password or whatever but after having the sheriff's dept check the cabin and determine that it was secure, we ended up taking our home phone off the hook, shutting off our cell phones and making the 4 hour drive up to our cabin to see what was up.  Thankfully, all was fine and we had a pleasant day in the mountains on very little sleep but a nice day anyway.  Battery indicator showed low but didn't say needed to replace so we left it as we were going back up at the end of the week anyways.  We were about 35 miles down the mountain when the unit called us.  Maybe the battery was low enough to trigger a false alarm?  Maybe a very large bug?  Who knows but one good thing, I figured out how to disarm it by cellphone!  We set the unit up with only the motion sensor as our cabin is very old and the windows and doors don't exactly line up but maybe we'll try it with a door sensor if the false alarms keep happening.  All in all, we're pretty happy with this unit.2012 Update - we kept losing our dial tone when the system was plugged in. I emailed Mace's customer service and received a reply within 24 hours.  Apparently they have had instances where lightning storms can cause damage to the unit resulting in the symptom I relayed. They sent a new unit with instructions on how to sync it with the existing components. Installed with a surge protector and have gone through more than one lightning storm since with no problems!

Both problems were user error but Mick got me up and running quickly.One drawback to the auto-dial that has already been mentioned in another review here is that by the time you answer your cell phone, the alarm message is almost finished and you have no time to enter a command before the next number is dialed.

Some users complain about short battery life in the motion and/or door sensor. This could be a problem if the sensors are in area with lots of traffic.  I suggest the use of 9 volt lithium batteries which has 5-10 years shelf life and six times the life of an  alkaline battery. Do not use the cheap general purpose batteries.  They have very short life.  My suggestion for improving this fine system is to give an aural alarm when the batteries are weak as one does not look at the control unit all the time and use the remote for exit and entry turn on/off.  The battery in the control unit just floats in a standby mode and its shelf life is considered to be 3-4 years and seldom needs replacement.  One can find additional sensors and remotes on Ebay.
