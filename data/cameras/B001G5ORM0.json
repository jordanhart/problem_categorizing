{"Reviews": [{"Title": "SECURITY CAMERA IRX36, CABLE & PS", "Author": "RAM", "ReviewID": "R1D4YBKAGE64JH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is very well built, weatherproof, has a movable sun screen and works as expected for 420 TV line resolution camera.  This camera is a great value for the money and the price just came down to boot. It is mounted in a high exposed location where the coverage of the 3.6mm lens provides a semi wide angle view.  The 28 LED provide adequate illumination for a distance of about 35 feet.  It may work at a greater distance but that is distance in my installation.  The cables exit the camera out of the center of the back so there is no real way to protect them from vandalism at this point.  The camera comes with a 100 foot cable 1/8 of an inch in diameter and a power supply.  This cable was used in initial testing of the camera and it worked OK but I would not use this cable in the actual permanent installation because it appears too fragile.  Too many bad reviews of small cables even though his one may be OK I will not take a chance.  It takes hours to install the cables in my installation.  If the cable fails because I stepped on it or bent it wrong it would be a major job to replace.  I used full size RG59 Siamese cable with 95% shielding and 2-18 gage solid copper power lines.  Camera gets a 5 star but as a set with the cable it is a 4 star.", "Date": "November 22, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,499.95", "Features": "Built-in 1/3\" Sony CCD imager, color DSP\n420 TV lines high resolution. 20 IR leds for night vision\nBuilt in f 3.6mm lens for wide view angle.Weatherproof housing.
