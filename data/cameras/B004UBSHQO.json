The device was on special and I figured it would help get my feet wet.  I have been a geek for over 30 years and I met my match with this one.  One needs to be a geeks geek to follow the set up instructions - especially the ones to provide remote access and setting up the motion detection fields.  As a camera it works just fine but I would never ever recommend this to anyone I know as I do not know anyone who could actually get it set up. This device will not even store the date settings when unplugged for a few minutes.  Sorry Trend Net but get your instructions written MUCH more clearly and and I think you would have a decent product.--October 2011 update--  OK to be fair to this product now that I have the hang of it I have to say it is working as advertized and I can view the image from anywhere in the world with a click of the button.  Yes it took a while but with a little research on the internet the pieces kind of came together.  Don't give up.  Would I buy another one.  Yes but I would opt for the night vision option as well.  Night vision is kind of important in a surveillance cam.

I connected it to Airport Extreme route via Ethernet cable (alternatively, you can connect it to your provider router)2. Since the reserved IP was no longer valid, I logged into my Action tech router given to me by Verizon FIOS service3. I identified the device from Actiontech network menu based on the MAC address (the device MAC address is printed at the back of the camera). based on the MAC address, i identified the new IP address4. Once identified the IP address, copied it into browser (Firefox in my case)5. Voila...user name and password..admin..admin..in both cases..make sure you change the password later6. now I am in camera configuration, i was asked to use the user name and password by Java again for some reason, no problem, retyped it both7. now it is time to config your camera, change camera name etc...most importantly, see if it is working..it should give you a nice live image now..8. then ensure that from network-->wireless, you configure it for your WiFi network, you should let it scan for the network from the menu and see your wireless network9. click on the WiFi network find10. select security setting now.. make sure select the right wireless security your WiFi router uses, and correct password11. now, we know that t=camera works while connected to router via Ethernet cable.. but you want to use it wireless right?..12. to do that, first unplug the Ethernet cable, then unplug the power for the camera13. no need to hurry and move the camera away, test it in the same place just in case you need to plug back if wireless connection fails14. now, connect the camera to power, after few minutes it should connect to your WiFi and green light needs to start blinking, if not, Houston, we have a problem...15. lets hope that green light started blinking, now log back into camera with the IP and see if you see video16. if everything is done right, you were able to configure WiFi connection from camera setting earlier, you should be bake to see something if so, skip the next bullet- If wireless connectivity fails I suggest you reset camera settings and start over..I tried to restart without resetting, but failed, reset deletes all previous configurations and takes you to back to a clean start..i know hassle but better to start from scratch.. the way to reset is to push a pin into a small hole on the rear of the camera for 6 seconds and let is go while camera is powered.17. Hoping that now your WiFi connection is working..  means you are good to go.. just unplug the camera and install it anywhere..18. But here is the issue, your camera is configured to be access within your WiFi network. Don't you want to use it on 3G network or away from home?19. If so, you need to get another IP address.20. Verizon Actiontech router handles it for me. It has a setup remote access function listed next to the camera in network lists of all connected devices.it will give you an external IP address. This number contains the following:a. [...] b. your FiOS gateway's Internet IP Address, c. :, d. port number(s) of your web camera21. -read the IP address to use it from outside..write it down..you will need it..I will tell you when below..22. Accessing via iPhone and iPad over WiFi or 3G:23. Now all is good to go, if you have iPad and iPhone, download LiveCamsPro app24. Select security camera option25. go to add camera26. Select the camera model from the initial list, make sure you select the right one for this camera27. In setting menu enter IP address, give a name to your camera (e.g. Home camera 1), username, password from original camera setting (I hope you changed default password), I chose refresh rate as 1..28. Now, you should be bale to access your camera on 3G network while away from home.REMEMBER: Due to lack of ActiveX, certain camera functions from IP access via browser will not be available when using Mac and non IE browser..Anyhow, I know this is a way too long review, but the goal is to help Mac users out there..If you have issues and cannot resolve after few resets, just add comment to this review, I will try my best to help.Good luck !", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad", "Author": "F.

My biggest problem is TRENDnet not having any decent software. I set up 5 cameras in one house and 1 camera in my office. The cameras in the house used one software program from TRENDnet and the other camera used a totally different software. Apparently they don't make software that works with all their cameras. I ended up using mainly android apps and open source software that lets me view them all on one program.The cameras also do not work well unless you setup your network under a static ip address. So basically anytime anyone goes to that house, I have to setup their device on the static network. The firmware is old and very slow to configure the cameras, after I got everything working I was almost done with messing with them anymore. The other problem was the automatic recording feature only works locally and you cannot reliably get e-mails to be sent out.TLDR: It's not bad for viewing and sometimes hearing conversations in a room.

This one, after poking around, I ended up reading the manual as the camera didn't want to connect with the wireless. The manual states that as soon as your done putting the settings (SSID, ...) you need to unplug the camera from the outlet AND you need to unplug the RJ45 cable!I did it, didn't work on the first time. I had to factory reset the camera then do it again. This time, after a few seconds, the signal was picked up and I was up and running.

It is nice to have the date and time while recording and be able to select what days/hours you want an active recording/monitoring.I have just tested the Android app SecurView in order to watch your camera through the Internet and it worked.
