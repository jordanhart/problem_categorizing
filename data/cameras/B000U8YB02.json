{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Only a little misleading...", "Author": "Michael Mills", "ReviewID": "R39FD6496B6AD7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera isn't as big as the one that I am replacing (due to it getting nicked on holiday).  I figured it wouldn't have nearly the same quality, but it's size and simplicity seem to be just what my wife wanted.  She got that and a great picture quality to boot.The things that I like most about this camera are it's size and ability to be carried around the wrist (less likely to be left somewhere).The things I like least about this camera are the lack of built in rechargeable batteries, the lack of a way to turn off the LCD preview when you want to just use the manual viewfinder.I bought rechargeable AA's and have yet to need to recharge/replace them, so maybe the LCD isn't that big of a deal... and neither is the rechargeable part.Good purchase.  Momma is happy... everybody's happy.", "Date": "January 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice point and shoot camera", "Author": "Bruce V. Backlund", "ReviewID": "R2GEBTOJRVXK4Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The HP has a image quality that I would equate to a one time use 35mm camera. I wanted a carry around camera that was ready instantly and without a optical zoom this camera fits my needs. Camera is user friendly and easy to learn. Software was OK. It has a viewfinder along with a standard lcd on the back which I throught was a little dim. My overall opinion was while this was certainly not in the 250-500 dollar range of quality digital cameras and should not be for the 70 dollers I paid for it, it is a nice compact digital camera, take along type, that fits my needs. Flash quality is good for it's price. I thought the software was ok, but took a long time to put the program on my computer. I do recommend this camera for anyone wanting a small take along camera of very good quality.", "Date": "February 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good entry level camera", "Author": "H. Metcalf", "ReviewID": "R1CALS7A6Y5JQI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my 12-year-old son and I'm very impressed with how easily he has been able to take good photos.  I've been a long-time HP camera fan, although I've purchased two other brands recently, and this camera does not disappoint.  Good value for the money, easy to use, software is straightforward and easy, overall a great camera for the entry-level photographer.  Small enough to fit in your pocket.  Great deal, and I would recommend it.", "Date": "January 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "We love our first digital camera!!", "Author": "Chad Oberholtzer", "ReviewID": "R21RP0Z0NHE38P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I are always a bit behind the times with technology, and we've been using an old-school camera with film for years.  This Christmas, I decided to treat my wife to this digital camera, though I had no idea what I was buying.  As it turns out, I got lucky, as this has been exactly what we needed.Obviously, if you're looking at this camera, you understand the digital camera concept.  We have absolutely loved the ability to discard bad pictures, transfer our pictures onto our computer, crop and adjust them, make slide shows, e-mail them to friends, and all of the other perks that come with digital pictures.  What we did not expect was how well this cheap model would work.The quality of the pictures is fabulous.  The camera is extremely user-friendly.  My wife constantly comments on how amazingly light it is.  The only complaint is that the resolution gets pretty crummy when you zoom in, but that's a small problem for such a cost-effective camera.I'm sure that this camera doesn't have many of the bells and whistles of more expensive options.  We can't send e-mail through our camera, it doesn't double as a pocketknife, and it can't drive our car when we get tired.  But it does everything we need and more.  I am happy to recommend this camera to anyone interested in a high-quality, basic digital camera, especially as an entry into the digital world.  It has made me irritated that we didn't make this investment sooner!!", "Date": "March 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wonderful", "Author": "Goldie M.

All the options, styles, and what the heck are pixels and what do they have to do with pictures, anyway? Well it turns out that the 5 megapixels are great for my small to medium photos. The battery lasts for a while, even longer if you take measures to save the battery. Even though I do not find it hard to figure out how to use technology, I think even my mom could figure out how to use this. The buttons and menus are so easy, and it even explains what the options mean and how they affect your pictures. My only issue is that I didn't know I had to buy a memory card for it, so there you go: Buy a memory card and shoot away!", "Date": "April 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Perfect for first time users.", "Author": "T.
