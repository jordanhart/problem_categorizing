Croft", "ReviewID": "R1SHT6A2VPCMV4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:  Affordable, small, overall descent cameraCons:  Not super high quality build and only descent pictures not greatI'm a professional photographer and do not expect this to act like my pro gear but I also have been shooting with a Canon SD1000 which is the 3rd or 4th Canon Digital Elph I have owned so I'm comparing to my experience with those other little point and shoots.The Casio is small, feels good in the hand, and takes a fairly descent 10 MP shot.  I do like the dedicated video button and the fact that shooting in wide mode adds pixels to the sides instead of chopping off pixels on the top and bottom.  The controls are simple and there are quite a lot of settings and customization options.  Overall it takes a pretty descent picture.  So there are a lot of cameras out there that can claim this.  So lets get to some of my gripes that other descent cameras might not have.The autofocus is kind of slow and sometimes will not even lock in so the picture won't take making you miss your opportunity.  Even still when it does lock in it seems to be locking into the wrong spot because about 30% of my pictures aren't in focus where I want them to be.The flash flashes twice (even with Red Eye not activated).  This causes a considerable lag between pressing the button and the picture actually being taken.  So 1, 2, 3 cheese and it takes on 4 instead of 3.The auto adjustment in exposure is also slow so locking in a good exposure is a slow task.  There are some good settings for how the exposure is calculated which allows me to control this better since I know what I am doing but I had to customize the settings which I don't think most average consumers are going to do.It has a micro USB connection which adds a cable to my collection since my other devices don't use it but rather a mini USB connection.  Likewise the charger is small but it has a considerably big electrical cable  to go with it.  These things lessen the portability of the camera.  The canon's charger was tiny and the electrical plug twisted out of the charger itself (no cable).I cannot zoom when I am videoing.One of my biggest gripes is the camera doesn't seem to recognize when I am shooting in portrait mode (turned sideways for a tall picture) so I have to manually rotate all of my pictures in my computer.  My canon did this automatically.Conclusion:  It is a cheap fairly descent camera but would be so much better if lots of the picture taking parts were faster, more pictures were in focus, and the details like cables and auto picture rotation were better.I would not buy this camera again but I will continue to use it since it was given to me as a gift and I have it to use.", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Warranty doesn't cover the body of the camera.", "Author": "S.

After a while, though, with no obvious triggering event - it started taking worse and worse quality pictures. It started with a noticeable deterioration in indoor photo quality - grainy and blurry - to the extent that I do not even bother taking photos indoor anymore. Then the lens retraction stopped working properly (it gets stuck halfway through the retraction, and I have to physically push it back in). Next, the zoom/focus stopped working, and when I change the zoom level (especially if I try to zoom all the way out), everything turns into a blur. Most recently, I am not even getting good pictures outdoors, and I would say 9-out-of-10 photos I take do not turn out. It is sad to me because I had some excellent \"honeymoon days\" with this camera but then witnessed clearly diminishing quality over several months.

I use it to take pictures of the products I am selling, so I mainly use it for a very close range (1' - 4' maximum distance.) I love my job, but this camera is absolutely the bane of my existence. I HATE it. It makes my job twice as frustrating, and every listing I create takes me twice as long because of this lousy piece of junk.This camera takes excellent pictures.... of the background. Everything that is further than a 5' distance will be crisp and perfectly in focus. But close-ups are spotty at best. The autofocus is horrid. You can change the settings, the lighting, the location, your angle, what you're focusing on, but none of it seems to matter. If you are in a close shooting range, only parts of your picture will be in focus and everything else around the edges will be fuzzy. I have to point the autofocus guide (the little green square on the viewer) at lettering or a sharply contrasted edge before it will focus enough to snap a picture, and even then usually the edges of the photo will be blurry. All of the pictures of my products look shoddy and unprofessional, all because of this stupid camera.TL;DR - Use this to take pictures of stuff that is 5' or more away from you.

The camera was never mistreated, but I sure feel like I was. They even wanted $10 to return the broken camera if I didn't want it repaired. I told them to keep it since the photo quality was never that great to begin with and the control buttons are way too small for human fingers.

It doesn't have panoramic, like the nikon s220. Photo quality seems to be roughly on par with those of the nikon, as I compare photos taken with both cameras.I'm no photog nut. I just want a simple camera.One thing both the nikon and the casio have are best shot settings, which supposedly have settings optimized for night shooting, magazines, etc.The nikon's best shot modes are a little better than those for exz33. Shots taken on the casio in best shot mode come out blurred, underexposed, etc.On the \"night scene\" best shot setting, the flash doesn't come on (??) I called casio a month ago. The first rep automatically said that there was something wrong with the camera and I'd have to send it in for repairs.I called back in again, and the 2nd rep did a bit more troubleshooting. She said she had the exact camera model on hand, and guided me step by step. End result, on my camera, the flash still didn't come on, but she claimed one her camera, for the night scene mode, the flash did come on.Well, on the strength of that, I exchanged my camera and had Amazon send me another one.In the meantime, while waiting for the camera, I went to Target and tried a working display casio camera. It was a different 'ex' model, but had the same options. Lo and behold, in the night mode, the flash didn't come on!When I got my replacement camera, I tried the night mode, and no flash, as before.I even bought another exz33 from Walmart, and tried that, with the same result.The thing is, in the auto mode, the flash comes on, and everything works just fine. Even in the best shot setting, \"night scene portrait\", the flash comes on.At this point, I decided to call casio again, and explained to them that, having tried at least 3 exz33's, I got the same result, and it's unlikely that I'd get 3 random defective cameras. I also told her I got the same result on another model of 'ex' camera.She couldn't tell me anything aside from telling me to send it in.Obviously, her tty terminal didn't have any other recommendation.These people don't know their cameras from their calculators.In the meantime, I've decided to hang on to my casio, because in the auto mode, everything works like a charm. I'll just steer clear of the Best Shot settings, because the results are the same across ALL of the casios I've tried, blurred and underexposed.The nikon is at least $29 more, and the $74.95 price tag is as cheap as I'm likely to get. Already, the price of the exz33 is $92.95 at Amazon. At this price point, I recommend getting a nikon s220. I don't know if nikon's tech support is a clueless as casio's.Bottom line, don't expect much from casio's tech support.", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "I hate this camera.  Every picture it takes is terrible.", "Author": "Seana Y.", "ReviewID": "R3N37JV2JQ0EGN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera because I had the Exilim EX-Z80A and loved it and it broke when sand got in the lense.  However, this camera is far inferior to that one.First, it takes forever to take a picture.  Literally 2-6 seconds from the moment you depress the button to the time it takes the photo.  Sometimes it doesn't even take the picture.  Also, once it decides to take the picture, the screen goes black.  If you move the camera at any time during this black screen, it'll mess up the picture because you don't know when it's actually taking it.Second, it takes TERRIBLE pictures.  EVERY TIME.  It has this menu for retards that is called \"best shot\" where you choose from a gallery of options, such as Portrait or Landscape.  There are no manual options.  Seems easy enough right?  Well, when I select Portrait and aim it at someone's face, the face comes out blurry and the background is in focus.  Every time.  Night or day.  Flash or no flash.  I used the Landscape setting for a landscape and it came out one of two ways, either the sky was perfect and the ground was black/underexposed or the ground was exposed well, but the sky was blasted out super bright white.  When I leave it on the Auto setting and aim it at someone's face, the flash is so bright that their faces turn out super white with barely any features, yet they still manage to be blurry with only the background in focus.I've actually taken pictures in the same situations with both my iPhone and this camera and the iPhone pictures turn out better.  I have the quality on the highest 10.1 megapixel setting, but they all turn out looking like 2 megapixel photos with this camera.In conclusion, I hate this camera with a passion.  It is the worst digital camera I've ever used.  I'm returning it and repairing my old Exilim EX-Z80A, which I love and which takes amazing pictures as soon as you press the button.
