I bought these cameras to be able to see what was happening in my house during the day while I was away.  I LOVE them!!  I can log in from my computer at work and see what is happening in four different rooms.  I can check my son's nursery to see if he is sleeping when its suppose to be nap time.  I can look into the living room to make sure the TV is off when its suppose to be.  I feel much more connected to them during the day and more secure knowing that I can see them and can \"supervise\" just a bit even though I can't be there all the time. The cameras were very easy to install - which is a plus for me since I'm not particularly techno literate.

I have it looking out my front window to track people coming to the front door. I only found a few problems:- It seems to activate to record clips even though the motion sensed is outside the area set up in the software. I excluded the road but it still records every car that drives by.- I had it set up to email me a snapshot when it sensed motion. It worked for a while but it stopped. I guess I have to sign up for the Platinum service?- You have to sign up for the service to zoom control the camera remotely and to be able to watch recorded videos remotely.- Lastly, the most important problem. The power adapter has a fan that is very audibly noisy. It's pretty annoying, about as noisy as my Playstation 3. Sometimes the fan pick up dirt and moans even more.", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "I love these things.  Have 4 cameras now for 6 months.", "Author": "M. Barnett \"nonartist, but wannabe\"", "ReviewID": "RES5U6TD5IDF6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this system.  I live in a large house.  So far there are 4 cams.  3 are inside, one outside.You may have to unplug/plug you main USB thing at the computer a couple of times during initial installation of cameras or software install.  But after that, it's worked flawlessly.I even have another power-line network going at the same time.I use these inside cameras suctioned cups to windows pointing outside.  They do really well in my opinion and the software is great.  Online viewing is cool too.I work downstairs and it's a long ways up to the front door.  I have a camera on the second floor that point down the driveway.  I get a pop-up when the mail truck goes by, a car drives into the driveway, etc.  It's FANTASTIC that I don't have to come running or won't miss a doorbell.At night, I've caught bats flying around outside.However...... I would NOT recommend it for business use where you need to report exactly what a person's faace is to the police... or need to make out a license plate number.I'm planning on adding more outside cams as they get slightly better pictures, especially at night.  It'll even detect the motion of birds or squirrels if you set it up that high.So, overall, I can't recommend it enough except that perhaps it's a little expensive but looking at what you get I think it's more than worth it.", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice but abit touchy & comes with setbacks", "Author": "KAREN \"DarnRedhead\"", "ReviewID": "RF6K0ZLJMW29Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Logitech Wilife was extremely easy to install! But with this system you must have a computer/laptop running at all times (also called the Command Center). Leaving this Command Center running constantly will also periodically have messages pop up or laptop to overheat. If that happens your connection is lost. I usually lose connection daily so I reboot my Command Center every morning before leaving. Yet I still lose connection daily, don't know why Logitech has Command Center issues, but they do. Another problem is the cameras are very touchy. I went through 3 of them before finding a working camera. They overheat easily and you lose your streaming picture due to this periodically as well. I can't get the record streaming/record motion detection to work so that probably means I need to purchase monthly monitoring service through Logitech, which I don't want to do. But, with these setbacks the picture is nice except no night vision unless you purchase separately, which means you must buy a regular camera $140+ then buy the night vision lens $140+ rendering your first purchase to buy the shell since you remove the regular optics to the night vision optics. Very poorly thought out by Logitech. The only plus is the easy of installation, other than that I have now purchased a wireless IP, PTZ camera so it is more versitile and covers more of one area unlike a stationary camera. Hindsight, I would not have purchased this product. Logitech needs to go back to the drawing board.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great product - reasonable price", "Author": "S. M.

Also this camera has the newer power supply like my #2 camera, but the fan doesn't run.Otherwise I find the Wilife system good, and reliable enough. I don't think hardwired systems are any more reliable and these are easy to move around--just plug them in. I basically watch my cats during the day and keep tabs on the maid.
