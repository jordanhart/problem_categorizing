{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Reason for the Mixed Reviews", "Author": "Tim Naff \"Tim\"", "ReviewID": "R375RQPREULE9T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Are you confused by the most polarized set of reviews on Amazon?  I was.  Some said it took wonderful pictures; some said it took terrible pictures.  It was as though half the cameras were defective.  They weren't and they aren't.  Here's the deal:  this camera is a little more prone to bluring than some other, mostly larger, cameras.  In technical terms, it has only one aperture setting, and it's pretty wide, which means the depth of the image that is in focus is somewhat shallow.  Also, the sensor is not the most sensitive, so, even with the large aperture, it needs plenty of light or it will set for longer exposures and get bluring from camera shake.  Finally, the built-in image stabilization is limited and will only help if you don't shake it much.  This all adds up to a tendency to take blurry pictures, especially indoors.So with all that, why did I give it four stars?  Because the little camera is fully capable of taking sharp pictures.  Believe me when I say I know what sharp pictures are:  I have an A850 with a Zeiss 24-70 lens.  I also have an excellent (and highly recommended) DSC-100 with Zeiss optics, two aperture settings, and the option of full manual control.The first pictures I tried with the DSC-180W were indoors in available light (no flash).  The results were abysmal.  The next thing I tried was using the flash.  The results were mixed, because the camera's autofocus system was confused by the complex scene, and the depth of focus is shallow.  Then, still indoors, I aimed at something fairly flat with the flash, and voila, it produced a picture sharp enough that it took full advantage of all the pixels.  That's all the resolution you can ask for.  I tried it at long range and short range, with zoom and wide-angle, and continued to get good results.The next day, I took it outdoors along with my DSC-100 and shot a number of scenes with both cameras for comparison.  The DSC-180W did well.  It was a little more contrasty than the 100, and the colors were a little more saturated, both of which I attribute to in-camera processing.  I put the images into Photoshop and was able to extract the shadow detail that had been lost to the contrast.  Of course, the 180W's more contrasty, saturated pictures looked better in some ways.  Saturation aside, the two cameras agreed well on color rendition, indicating no major chromatic aberation.Understand that I was looking at these images on a 24 inch monitor and then blowing them up even more.  And I've shot some amazing things with the DSC-100, which, when new, cost four times what the 180W costs today.  Used DSC-100s command rediculously high prices today for what they are.  My point is that I was not easy on the 180W.Other notes:  The screen is very bright.  You have to press the shutter button harder than I'm used to, so squeeze when you shoot, or you'll create camera shake.I gave the camera four starts, because it's a good deal for the dollar.  It's way more compact than the 100.  If you buy it, don't set unrealistic expectations.  Shooting indoors, use the flash (which will only work on fairly close subjects) or use a tripod or set it on a bean bag.  Don't shoot into complex scenes of varying distances and expect it to put everything into simultaneous focus.  You CAN have high expectations when you shoot landscapes and almost anything outdoors from a reasonable distance. Depth of focus grows with the distance from the camera.  The optics are not bad, in spite of what some reviewers have said.  I got good resolution many times in many circumstances, so the optics are just fine. Those reviewers caused the bluring with camera shake and focus issues, just as I did on my first few shots.I bought this camera for my wife so that she could do some independent picture taking on our upcoming trip to Europe.  I could have sent it back, but I decided it was a keeper.I hope this helps you with your decision.Update:  After 18 months, my wife still enjoys using the camera and doesn't want to trade it in for a later model.  She has made some superb shots with it.Tim", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "AWESOME CAMERA!", "Author": "B.

NOTHING is sharp... and it over saturates the colors. I tried every setting and i might get 1 out of every 10 photos in focus... and again, it looks good on the camera, but when i import them.. i end up trashing them all and it's very disappointing. I'm a graphic designer by trade - and while I was only looking at this for personal snap and shoot opportunities... i know i could trust my old camera... but not this one.also the delay time in between being able to take shots is incredibly long and slow.I know this camera was on sale, and I previously had a Sony Cybershot (wtih a Carl Zeiss lens) and loved it. this has left a bad taste in my mouth. avoid this specific model at all costs unless you want to throw money down the toilet.grrrrrrrrrr", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Nq \"Nq\"", "ReviewID": "R71CO8CRVKCGO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not an expert in digital cameras and cannot compare this camera to other brands, but for my personal use it is fantastic, I love it.

I owned a previous generation sony cybershot with the Carl Zeiss lens and absolutely loved that camera. It was probably the most wonderful electronic device I've ever purchased. Sadly, I dropped it and broke it. :( So naturally I bought another sony cybershot, only this time I was a little short on cash and decided to buy the more economic model with the sony lens. This camera turned out to be the worst electronic device I have ever purchased. A previous review in this thread speaks to the mixed reviews of this camera and states that this camera is capable of taking good photos. It is true, this camera is capable of taking good photos 1 out of every 50 photos you take. The previous review also leads you to believe that the only flaw is that the camera is prone to taking blurred photos. This is not true. To me this camera takes extremely low quality photos, and I don't mean pixelated. The colors are horrible, the lighting is horrible, this camera is horrible. Please believe me when I say, for a camera in this price range you should buy another brand... any other brand, or upgrade to the Zeiss lens. I will not be purchasing any more sony cameras because, to me, a company should have a consistent level of quality in its top of the line as well as economic products.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect camera, except for the pictures", "Author": "B.

Sometimes, the camera takes amazing, clear pictures.  However, other times, the pictures come out horrible!

This happens when it is dark as well.I have taken pictures in bars, pool halls, restaurants, in my kitchen, etc., and each time, the pictures come out \"funky\"- everything looks yellow being one of the most common problems! It is very frustrating because occasionally pictures do come out fine, but it's really a gamble as to when they will be good or bad.  I think that's why some people rate the camera 5 stars is because of that, maybe they don't take as many pictures and haven't noticed any \"yellow\" pictures yet.  But I take a lot of pictures in different places and I have noticed this problem happen over and over!I will admit the camera is a nice size, looks good and is easy to use- but it's not worth buying because so many of your picutres will eventually come out oily, yellow, blurry, or too dark/light.", "Date": "March 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not so hot", "Author": "R.

I ignored all the posts about the picture quality and design of the camera because so many people said the pictures were fine. I'm not a big picture person, but I compared it with a 4 year old sony camera that was only 7 megapixels and probably not near as many features, and I could tell an obvious difference between the picture quality and lighting. The quality was worse, and the lighting was off, not to mention had a yellow hue. What i ignored when looking at the reviews is the importance of the \"Carl Zeiss\" lens. The sony lens is far inferior, so just go ahead and pay for the next step up to get the Carl Zeiss lens. I went back and got the w230 and it's great.

I figured in this day and age no matter what camera you get it's going to take reasonable pictures. That was a false assumption on my part. This camera does not take satisfactory pictures, especially in motion. I had a Canon that was several years dated, the same basic size and took better pictures. Along with that, Sony cameras now greatly frustrate me. Their batteries, memory cards, USB cords, battery chargers, and pretty much any other accessory you can imagine is different for almost every camera. It's always difficult to find what you need on the go and the memory card is hardly adaptable with anything. If I could go back in time I wouldn't have bought this camera, and won't be buying more Sony cameras.

We are going to Japan on vacation soon and I wanted photos from her perspective.  It is very easy for her to use and she likes the red color.  I love that it came with a rechargeable battery but wasn't thrilled that it needed a special Sony memory card.

Fortunately, Best Buy was running a deal on the black model, Lowepro bag for it's size, and a 4GB Memory Stick Pro for $130.  Since my DSLR Sony uses the same memory, I swapped the $19.95 card for an open item second battery.  For the wife and kids, quick snap shot needs, you can't beat the camera/price!  It will take 10 MP pictures with ease but I find my self using the PGM mode to control ISO, etc.  The camera captures only in JPG (as far as I can figure) so the images need to be in focus for the picture to be its best.  Sometimes the flash is too bright but fortunately you can set it to its lowest intensity and things work out well, especially when doing sync flash (SL) for fore- and background illumination.  This is the small pocket camera I'll carry when the DSLR bag is far to much for the event.  For the price, you will be happy.", "Date": "March 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good camera", "Author": "G. L.
