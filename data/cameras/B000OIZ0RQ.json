I was until now a diehard Nikon fan, but this camera has made me see the light. It's my 2nd digital point and shoot (my first was a Nikon CoolPix 775 - which was lovely when it came out, but now terribly out of date).  I'm glad I was open to trying another brand. I was strongly considering the Nikon Coolpix s50c and was almost swayed by its wireless capability, but am so happy with the quality of the photos taken with the Samsung I know it was the right choice for my everyday needs. It's easy to use, has a nice feel to it, bright and clear LCD panel, shooting modes that are actually useful and result in very satisfactory results and much more.  I also own a Nikon 6006 and regularly shoot with a Nikon D70 and have actually had more success with the Samsung NV11 point and shoot than the Nikon digital SLR. It also takes nice digital movies with clear audio.  Try it.

Phan", "ReviewID": "RX6JCUZIRUJHS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "oh, the camera rules and i recommend it for sure, but there's little things that bug me about it.1. the battery life is short.i'm really unhappy with this considering i am using this camera for adventures/vacations. maybe the smart touch buttons drain all the battery, but i am deeply not satisfied it. my old camera, a Nikon Coolpix P2 has a better battery life which lasted me about midweek during vacation despite my mistake of not bringing its charger. the samsung's battery can barely last a day and i'm quite disappointed in it and wish they had an extended battery.2. the screen is a dust magnet.but oh my, it's so clear and the images are very close, if not entirely, to the exact color of whatever subject you are taking a picture of.3. the camera strap is something to be desired. it scratches your skin. my manual's camera strap is more comfortable than that.4. no cloth to clean it?for a camera this nice, i'd expect a cloth to come along with it. but if it really bugs you, like it mildly does for me, you can just go out and purchase your own. still, that's kind of lame.5. the usb link port or whatever you call it is on the bottom?this seems to me a reoccuring thing since it's in my friend's Sony Cybershot DSC-100 as well. this annoys me because what if water was spilled on the floor and it got into my camera? that'd be terrible. i don't think i'd ever be negligent enough to do that, but someone might. liquid spreads and could be spilled anywhere. i'm just looking out for the camera and my wallet, that's all. CAMERA MANUFACTURERS PLEASE STOP PLACING THE USB LOCATION AT THE BOTTOM, IT'S NOT COOL.all these things could be easily overlooked, so if you are thinking about purchasing this camera, don't worry so much because the pictures are amazing and accurate.", "Date": "May 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "impressive, but quirky", "Author": "Laura A. \"Laura\"", "ReviewID": "R3P5YDXRKPJM3E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as an alternative to lugging  my D100 to my weddding and on my honeymoon.The body style is great with black metal (yet to see a scratch - though I am very careful) and sleek enough to keep in my purse for that perfect moment when everyone wishes they had a camera handy.Before I get into picture quality let me again restate that I am accustomed to using a Digital SLR on manual mode  Using this camera is for me like going from driving a car with a manual transmission to driving an automatic.  It's not difficult but if you're used to setting everything manually your still bound to be confused by the simplicity.Picture QualityOverall, the pictures have been good.  I've no complaints about that so muchEase of Use:Speaking of ease of use, a user manual had to be downloaded later from the Samsung website for this model as the brand new in the box camera only came with a quick-start pamphlet.My dear husband is better off just sticking with P(Program) and Scene shooting functions.  there is also a special shooting function which frames the photo in a drawing or create a photo collage but this can also be done after the fact as well.  Why ruin a possibly good shot with this feature?Of the shooting functions I feel that unless you are shooting still lifes you are better off using eitherP (Program) S (Shutter Priority)or A (Aperture Priority) manual takes too long to set up.On that note, there is also a manual focus setting which, is useless to me because most of my subjects like to move and not sit still.I think the touch sensitive buttons are confusing for everyone to begin with especially those who are not accustomed to using a laptop mouse pad.  It can be learned but handing the camera to my mother to view photos means that my settings will have to be reset.Under this topic I also have to consider the people who may have poor eyesight.  I appreciate that the LCD is large however without her glasses, my mother has a difficult time making out the details of the icons and text but samsung has also included example pictures to give people with her visual difficulty a hand with picking the right setting.LCDI really love the large LCD on the back of this camera.  It's terrific so is the fact that one can change the backlight settings to view in different light.IThe LCD also doubles as the viewfinder, which in bright sunlight it can be difficult to set up a good shot.Video:This is where I get annoyed. The video is great as long as you don't zoom in or out.  When you do the audio shuts off temporarily.  It's annoying.  I appreciate the feature but until it can be perfected it just takes away from everything that is great about this camera.Style:I get a lot of complements on this camera.  It's not a reason to buy a camera but it's nice to have others admire your gadgets. :)In conclusion:I reccomend this camera for a more advanced user but not for a beginner.  I would ultimately like to see digital cameras as a whole have more user-friendly features.  I think tiny buttons and small screens are problmes for users with poor eyesight and bad finger-eye coordination.", "Date": "May 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great point-and-shoot", "Author": "L. Bender \"bender_23\"", "ReviewID": "R2ATDXJ8IH6LN4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent camera for someone who wants a point-and-shoot camera that has a decent zoom. After looking for months for a reasonably priced camera that had more than a 3x zoom, I happened upon this one, did the research and bought it. Best camera I've had so far. I liked my old Canon, but it was heavy, went through batteries like water and the zoom left much to be desired. This one is much lighter, the battery lasts MUCH longer and the zoom is frankly superb. The Advanced Shake reduction really does work. With my Canon zoomed just past 3x I had to lean against something to make the picture come out. With this, I can zoom well past the 5x with my arms shaking from the effort of scrambling up boulders and the shot still comes out perfect. The huge LCD is great for being able to tell if the shot came out or not. The only con is the lack of a viewfinder. On sunny days, that's a bit of a hinderance since the LCD is harder to see, but the other pluses more than make up for it. Other reviews I read said the menu selection was tough to understand at first, but I found it extremely easy after messing with it for two minutes. Very intuitive and much easier to change settings quickly than my Canon.", "Date": "May 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Some problems, but overall very good camera", "Author": "Thomas R. Dekoster", "ReviewID": "R318T5SAF0XG05", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The first one I got had dust under the screen and I exchanged it. A little bit of dust is now visible in the new one too. This tells me that the camera isn't sealed up very well. The face recognition doesn't work very well either compared to my Canon Powershot SD750. It most often doesn't even recognize faces. I also wish the lens didn't protrude out so far when it is shut off, it makes it a too bulky to put in your pocket.LikesHigh Sensitivity up to ISO 160010.1 MPSolid build quality and industrial strength aesthetics.Intuitive touch interface - glide your fingers across the sensors horizontally & vertically to manipulate settings, edit photos, apply effects, or browse.Large screen - no wonder the camera is on the larger side.On board photo editing and effects - frame, add drop shadows, frames, rounded corners, etc. (Skip the post processing and add image effects directly on the camera and print).USB cable charging - charge via USB using the wall adapater or your computer.DislikesNo memory card - I understand that it is becoming the norm not to include a memory card, but a 512 MB wouldn't hurt.Image distortion with Advanced Shake Reduction enabled.Slow start-up time - a little bulkier and slower to start compared to standard point 'n shoot cameras.Bulky hard lined housing and obtrusive lens; check out the the compact sibling Samsung NV3 (7.2 MP).Weak flashNoticeable noise at ISO 100-400.", "Date": "October 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "MV11 - An Amazing camera !", "Author": "Richard W.

I wanted a high MP camera with a rechargeable battery that took black and white pictures.  After researching every camera I could find that met my requirements and some that didn't quite, I chose the Samsung NV11.The Pros:Without any technical knowledge it was kind of intimidating with all of the menus at first but I downloaded the manual off the Samsung website and the camera is VERY user friendly.  I am ESPECIALLY pleased with the Super Macro function, taking close ups of flowers etc it has an AMAZING zoom.  I love the video camera function, it'll take a movie up to 4 hours long (my Fuji finepix had a very short video limit).  It also came with an a/v hookup so I can connect my camera directly to my tv which I love.This camera is teaching me a lot too, using different options and functions I can tell instantly on the screen its effect on the picture.The Cons:The digital zoom from 3x to 5x tends to grain a lot and the battery life is just so-so. The audio on the video function cuts out when you try to zoom which is annoying but I bought an extra battery and work around the rest, overall I am VERY happy with my new camera!", "Date": "August 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "verry nice camera", "Author": "Brent", "ReviewID": "RZ9Y1LC5HP3FY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is really nice, I bought it before going to Sweden to study abroad and it has taken really nice pictures, some of the modes are really nice with the sunset and sunrise settings it tends to be really realistic as long as you use the right settings.

At first glance, I wasn't too sure about the Samsung NV11. It looked bulky to me - and old. But in the end, I trusted the great user reviews this camera has been receiving and WOW - I was NOT let down!This camera is the best! You really can't beat this camera for the price!PROS:It's not as big as it looks. Takes great quality videos AND pictures. The screen is really big. Great style! Lots of features. Battery life, despite complaints from other users, lasts as long (or longer) as a standard Nikon camera in the same price range (or more expensive). (I took mine on vacation and it lasted about 5 days of heavy usage. Great zoom! It comes with a USB chord to charge from your computer, OR the USB chord can plug into an adapter (included) that can be plugged into a wall socket. It's really a great device!Cons:Well I don't have any complaints at all, really... and I'm a very big critic of everything. I would recommend two counter measures, though, if you buy this camera: 1) Buy two 2GB SD cards to make sure you have plenty of room for taking pictures and videos. 2) Buy a couple extra batteries from Ebay and charge 'em all up before you go on vacation. Works like a charm!Final note: I highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "great camera....", "Author": "David M.
