Exactly what I wanted with large touch screen, a lens the never is in the way, simple to use, easy to carry, and I love the special features built in.  I've found that using the natural/flash simultaneous exposure feature is awesome.  I use it quite often when taking indoor photos and often times find a significant difference between the two photos.  I only have a couple of cautions with this camera (and these are human error issues).  First, be careful and don't get your finger in the photo.  Secondly, use the strap.  It's a very compact and slim camera and therefore has a little more potential for dropping.  That's all the 'negatives' I have about the camera and honestly those aren't about the camera, that's the operator!", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera", "Author": "T Man", "ReviewID": "R2OB6M7K4L9GVQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "after a long decision i decided to go with this camera i am very very impressed with it although i would buy a backup battery just to have it around because it usually dies after about 350-400 pics all around though i am really impressed", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Drea", "ReviewID": "R1ZPW9SWAJOVKD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Brought this camera for my Canada trip in 2011.

It takes beautiful pictures.  The only issue I have is that if you carry it in your pocket, it tends to turn itself on.  The camera activates by sliding the panel off the lens.  This happens often when carried in a pocket.  I purchased it because it's small and I wanted to be able to have it on hand.  Now I have to be careful where I carry it so it doesn't turn on accidentally.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Desert Shopper", "ReviewID": "R15L2OVDV1JOUP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My nine year old bought this camera with money he saved from his birthday.  He's used it for 4 months now and still likes it as much today as he did when he got it.  His favorite feature is the touch screen menu display.He likes that he can name his pictures, lock them to prevent deletion, and create picture albums.  He likes to search by date to find pictures he took on that date.  He has played with the film simulation to take pictures with sepia or black and white with decent results.  The picture quality is better than I thought it would be...especially considering he is a young user without camera usage training.It seems to be pretty intuitive because he hasn't expressed any frustration with the menu navigation and I know he has not read the manual.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "mimmim", "ReviewID": "R1KT84DQK0WOOG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this camera is very easy to use (i am electronically challenged) and takes great pics. we bought it as an upgrade from an older fuji model and are very happy with this purchase. my father always bought fuji cameras and i following his foot steps.i give it an AAA+", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice and compact", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R2O1FN5SJ9ZMPN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a good camera that was small so I could keep it on me at all times.
