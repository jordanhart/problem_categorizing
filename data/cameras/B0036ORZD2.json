Plus, you are able to zoom while in movie mode.  The 7x optical zoom is fantastic.  I love that I can touch up photos right on the camera and right from the get go the camera was easy to use.  I find that the buttons are set up very well in a user friendly manner.", "Date": "April 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Another wonderful camera from Nikon!", "Author": "Margaret Granado", "ReviewID": "RKW87I4U862GF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third in the Nikon Coolpix line, and I love it just as much as my previous ones! If you're a fan of any Nikon Coolpix, this will certainly be something you like!My only disappointment is that there isn't a \"Sports\" setting anymore, which was something I used a lot on my older models. However, the camera takes such fast pictures that it hasn't really become a problem as of yet.Battery life is good... haven't taken the time to see how many pictures it has per charge, but it's held up through at least 200 pictures at a graduation I went to recently without any battery indications.The charger is different than previous the Nikon Coolpix cameras I've owned, as it plugs directly into the camera as opposed to having to remove the battery. I'm not sure whether I like this, because the AC OUT cover is kind of stubborn to come out. Again, it's nothing that's become a problem.The HD movie is pretty cool. I haven't recording much with it, but the quality on it is wonderful. The record button is on the back of the camera, by the menu, which makes it extremely easy to switch from camera to movie. No setting change! This is definitely one of my favorite features, and is perfect if you like to take both stills and video!The zoom is great, and takes crisp shots from a good distance!The smart portrait feature is fun, but probably not something I'll really use. It's a good replacement if you don't want to use the self-timer, but again, it's kind of a pointless feature. Still interesting, though.I haven't played with the Subject Tracker yet, to be honest. I'll add more to this once I get a chance to mess around with it for a little while.Overall, it's a great camera! Not too heavy, though certainly a little bulkier and heavier than my previous Coolpix camera. Hope this helped!***EDIT 7/24/10Okay, after playing with the HD movie, I must say that it's pretty great if you don't mind that it plays on quicktime. The quality is amazing... hard to imagine a digital camera could make video this clear! The Quicktime thing is fairly annoying, and makes editing stuff in Movie Maker a pain, since you have to use a media converter to change the format.I did find out the sports feature does still exist, though not in the same place it has been on my previous Nikon Coolpix cameras. You have to use the menu settings and go under continuous - Sports. A little inconvenient, but I was happy to find it is still on the camera!The battery life is amazing. I took around 900 pictures in one night, as well as 15 minutes of movie and it is still not in need of a charge! With as many pictures as I take, battery life is a BIG thing for me!Overall, I still think it's a wonderful camera and still recommend it after a few months of constant use.

The pictures are so crystal clear that it is like looking at them in person! I also like the 7x optical zoom, which you are able to use during video recording. It has easy buttons to operate and there are tons of options to play with and very user friendly. It also takes close-up pictures up to 3mm that are NOT blurry! It has lots of options to have automatically set and very easy to switch to when chanigng scenery or from portrait to landscape. It also has the option of choosing one of your own pics as a screen saver every time you turn on the camera. I like that I can change colors of photos (i.e. black & white, sepia) with the press of a button or use the \"vivid color\" option. It has a great stabilizer and facial recognition software to remove red eye, tell you when someone has blinked in a pic or can soften skin in a photo.

I decided to try a Nikon after many, many years of Canon usage (still have several). This Nikon S6000 seemed like a lot of bang for the buck. My impressions so far:Pro's: Great pics, small size, easy to use, great macro, automatic scene selection, good focal lengthCon's: Power button too small, takes WAY too long to zoom after turning on, zoom is in large jerky steps so it's hard to find that \"right\" framing, poor battery/SD cover design - have to latch the door all the time (not spring loaded), flash use not always predictable in certain light.Would I buy it again?

My previous camera was a 2002 Nikon Coolpix 3500 which I liked but was outdated.  This camera is a big improvement.  And I used the video feature while on a boat along the Cinque Terre coast!  It did a great job and I have a nice memory of that beautiful coast line.The only thing I don't like is that it makes you charge the battery inside of the camera.  But I only had to recharge the camera twice in 2 weeks and took almost 400 pictures and videos.  So very happy with the battery power.This camera is much lighter than my old camera and I love that.  Very easy to handle and learn how to use;  menus are intuitive.  New features for me that I really like is the panorama shots and the auto selector.  Didn't have these on the 3500.Overall I love this camera but then I'm not looking for SLR quality.

Although basically a point-and-shoot, this small camera produces pictures that are comparable to the bigger models.In fact, it was a bigger model that led me to the COOLPIX S6000. I own, and love, my Nikon D300. The pictures it takes are nothing short of amazing. However, the weight and bulk of it sometimes get in the way of life. Sure you shoot pictures that are professional but there are times when you need to capture the moment but not with all the creative functionality weighing you down. That's where the S6000 shines. The Nikon technology and genius with photography are evident with the end product. True, you don't get to compensate for a lot of things and the price is a bit stiff for a second camera but it is one that you will use continually - either by itself or one that is easier to transport.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice little camera", "Author": "Yat H. Chow", "ReviewID": "RPXGQ52ZLHRI9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for small camera that does good video; to replace my Canon SD850.  The SD850 was nice but the video is bit fuzzy, specially with zooming.  The S6000 does very good job with the video, and in HD 780 mode.  I replayed the video on my HD TV and found it very detail and just like a regular HD movie.  The picture quality is very detail and sharp.  I have several printouts, Canon appears to be 'warm' comparing to the Nikon's.  Switching different mode is easy enough, you don't need to dig down the menu to find whatever you need. I like the scroll view when viewing stored pictures.  The videos are saved in MOV file, I view it with VLC Media player; I haven't bother to load the software came with the camera.  You do need to buy your own min-HDMI cable but it is not that expensive.  The only thing I don't really like is that you cannot use the zoom while in video mode.  So set up the zoom level before start recording because you cannot change it once recording started.  Also, don't use the continuous focus feature on video, it will try to refocus and miss the subject.  Fix the focus on video and it will do very well.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Mother's Day Gift!", "Author": "N.

I had always used Canon cameras and was happy with them, but I thought I'd try a Nikon because of its strong reputation. I was intrigued at the possibility of shooting HD videos of the kids when I don't have a video camera handy. I got the camera with a leather case in the \"kit\" package. I put the camera in its case and went to a big box store to get the appropriate SDHC card for the camera. When I got home and went to get the camera out, the back of the camera just above the screen was cracked! I was livid! I am not a person who throws brand new electronics around and I couldn't believe how UN-durable this camera was proving to be. (My Canon A610 has served me well with many bumps and falls in 5 years and it's still working beautifully - but is bigger and heavier to carry around - thus its replacement.) I brought the camera back to the store where I bought it and the clerks told me they couldn't return it because of impact damage. I told them the camera had been in my purse to the store and back. That's it. They said maybe the camera was jostled or perhaps my cell phone bumped the camera. I didn't realize a camera couldn't tolerate a \"jostle.\" They told me to put some electrical tape over the cracked case and move on.I thought I was buying a high-quality camera at $200. At least for that price I wanted it to last more than a few days without significant damage. If you get this camera, do yourself a favor and get a rigid camera case for it - unless you want it easily damaged. If you have a few extra bucks to get yourself a camera with a metal case rather than plastic, opt for the Nikon S8000. Or perhaps an impact-resistant camera. I wish I knew this before buying. I just thought they would naturally be metal or metal underneath with a plastic overlay.

If you shoot still life, this is probably a good camera.  I teach preschool and need a quick shutter speed and a camera that's ready to reshoot in an instant.  This one isn't it.  The pictures seem soft, outdoors was ok but the camera is not ready quickly for a second shot.  And kids move quickly.  Slow to turn on - I often had to tell the children to wait a sec before being able to take the picture.  Indoor shots were yellowish, over-exposed or had facial shadows, and believe me, I tried various flash settings, changed the ISO and the shooting mode.I was very disappointed as the reviews were all great.  Camera has a lot of nice features, but just didn't produce the kind of pictures I was used to with my Canon or Kodak.  Returned it and went back to Kodak.  Don't recommend Nikon s6000.

I can tell the picture and video quality is HD and I get a kick out of shooting small videos with sound with this camera.  The compact size is a plus for me as well.  I highly recommend this mid-grade Coolpix. I also purchased a 8GB memory card which seems to hold more pictures/videos than I would ever need since I constantly dump pictures from the camera into my well organized digital album located in my backup storage.

I love the picture quality, easy to use, and video capture w/ 720p HD. This camera can go a long way, great for beginners and awesome for travel use. Some people complaints how plastic it is or how light it is but this plastic made can do better than most of those metal made i just returned for refunds and replacements.

I tend to ignore bad reviews that do not involve the product but other things like delivery.I liked the look and size of this camera and found it had come down in price, which usually means they are about to introduce another model. I was about to take a trip with my daughter and never expected to get it in time.  It came the day before we left. I didn't have time to read the manual but put it together while I looked over the quick start booklet. I took a picture of my son, in the house with plenty of light etc. I just knew the photo would be over exposed or maybe too much red in the face. I was amazed at the flesh tone. Not only was it natural, it was exactly as he looked. I read later that it has a feature to correct skin tone and it works great.We went to a personal appearance of a celebrity and had to sit in the nose bleed section, tickets were sold out in 2 hours. My daughter took her camera also. The section was dark with the usual spotlight on the stage. I changed the \"scene\" setting to indoor/party and was prepared to change several times until I got the right effect. After about the third shot, my daughter put her camera away. Her photos couldn't compare with mine for color and clarity. It was a Nikon also, but 2 or 3 years old. I posted some of my photos on Facebook and some of my friends asked if we were really that close to the stage. The zoom and focus couldn't have worked better.When we left the event the next day we had to drive home through the snow. I took many pictures on this trip and the battery never went dead. I plan to buy a spare like my son did but so far I've not had any problems. A lot of people either don't know how or just don't use the \"scene\" feature.  They are really missing out on some great pictures. I tell my friends it is like using the f-Stop on the SLR at a much cheaper price.The battery thing is something I really expected. When these cameras first came out it was apparent that using the screen to view your photos was a battery drain along with the zooming and flash. Now that they no longer have view finders, we will just have to live with it.

The electronics are very fast and responsive, one of its strongest features.  The size is small and not the easiest to handle, but that is what you expect with a little pocket camera. The buttons are okay, but rather tiny.  Multiple program modes are available and the multi-point  auto-focusing is good.  The menus are average, but common features are available using the circular control on the back.  The display panel has excellent anti-reflective coatings and works well in daylight.  The display illumination can be changed, but is buried deep in the menus.  It has no viewfinder, which I don't like.  Holding the camera against your face is important for zoom shots, low light, or closeups.  The lens zoom range is very good, but not the largest.  The lens quality is excellent.  Very good anti-reflective coatings.  The optical distortion is very small and people will never notice it.  The video recordings are very good and include several resolutions up to HD quality.  The audio quality is above average for a pocket camera.  The battery is a special rechargeable lithium, one is included.  It gives good service, but a backup battery is essential to have on hand.  The battery is normally charged in the camera, but an external charger is can be purchased.

I'm really surprised at the One- and  Two- star reviews stating they had fuzzy pictures, etc.  He and I have had no problems.  It does have a slight lag in the auto-focus, which is pretty much an issue with all point and shoot digital cameras, that's why I rated it as a 4-star.

If you are shooting scenes with lots of motion, sports or kids moving, etc., a point and shoot is the wrong camera anyway, you'll need to move up to DSLR to be happy.

I found it in the Coolpix S6000.Reviews for this camera on Cnet and YouTube convinced me it would be a good buy, but I wasn't expecting to be instantly 'wowed' by it!  Being an intermediate digital photo enthusiast I've played with a lot of different digital cameras of varying sizes, speeds and with assorted perks such as optical zoom, macro and video capabilities.  While each one seemed to have one or two things it did very well, the Canon I dropped was as close to an all-purpose, go-to camera.  Upon playing with this Nikon I find myself wondering how I ever considered the Canon anywhere close to what I should want in a camera of this type.The Nikon Coolpix S6000 is my new favorite camera for everyday use because...1. Size - so compact and lightweight, you can carry it anywhere.2. HD Video - with the addition of a SDHC memory card (recommend 16 to 32GB) you have an HD video camera with stereo sound.3. Nikon lens takes great photos!4. Easy to set-up and use, out of the box.5. Many, many scene options for just the right settings, whatever your photo taking circumstances.  Really, really like the 'backlighting' one!6. Not a huge learning curve, so anyone from a child to a grandparent can easily learn to use it and take great photos.7. With 14.2 MP you can take great photos and get them enlarged to poster size without a loss of clarity or sharpness.8. It's as automatic as digital cameras get, but still takes amazing photos.9. Battery charges quickly via AC outlet hook-up, and holds a charge for hundreds of photos.10. 7x optical zoom is more than enough for most distance photos, and if you prefer to zoom in on something small like an insect or the petals of a rose, you have macro too.11. Face and smile recognition means you don't miss the perfect shot.12. Super-fast photo taking with image stablization - again, no missed or fuzzy shots.13. True color reproduction.14. Video or photo viewing via HDMI port on camera.15. Everything most families, students, travelers, and/or casual camera users could want in one inexpensive, easy-to-use package.If it seems like I'm gushing over this one, I am!  It's not often that I'm this happy with the speed, quality and ease of use of a camera, but this one does it for me.  The HD video is just the icing on the cake.If you are looking for a great 'go-to', point and shoot camera, this is the one!UPDATE: July 4, 2011After having used this camera in many different settings for months now I still consider this my point-n'-shoot, go to camera, but I wonder how long it will last?This evening it simply stopped - screen went black while viewing photos on the SD card - and the lens was out.  Turning it on and off did nothing, so I plugged in the charger - it too did nothing.  I removed the battery to check it and when I reseated it, the lens retracted.  I am charging it now and when untethered to the charger, it does turn on and off.I took some HD video the other day - it came out great, but I wonder if so sucked the battery that this happened?  I didn't see a low battery signal, so I find this curious.I'm finding I get hit and miss results on 'auto', but have learned to play with the scene settings to usually find something that works with a few trial and error shots.  The zoom works fairly well, but it's not meant for most distance shots over say 20'.Crossing my fingers this stoppage isn't a precursor to death.", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this camera !", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R374CYOX7CM6F8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a serious amature photographer for 40 years and have to say that this point and shoot camera is doing every thing that I am asking of it.As always good Nikon glass.The menu is easy to use.No problem with battery cover coming open.300 photos in the 2 months that I have owned this camera.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "nelle", "ReviewID": "R26XE6ANL055PF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am no technie but after a little practice at home, I was able to photograph a horse racing competition.

What's the point of paying extra for HD movie quality if the file compression makes it grainy?!  Also, to make quick copies of the movies to send to grandparents, I just use the software that came with Windows Vista- well, that software doesn't recognize .mov files.  You have to use quick time to play them back and I'm not sure what I'd need to use to burn them to a DVD. I am not interested in finding yet another software product.The quality of head to head point and shoot snapshots was also not any better on this model than on the S570.

It was my first day with the camera and I did not know what it was doing, and it froze for so long that perhaps I had no choice, AND there were other pictures on the SD card I had used in a digital frame so perhaps that was my error.

And despite the $20 cheaper price on the newer version, I think I did the right thing.  This is a very small camera and you really can't help putting your fingers on the screen while using it.  So I really think the mechanical controled S6000 version is definitely the way to go.Beyond that I was VERY impressed with this camera.  The pictures are VERY clear and the features totally blow me away.  I've had hundreds of cameras in my lifetime.  Many of them very high-end and some cheaper ones.  But this one is my favorite.  Its almost like Nikon took all my favorite features of my previously owned cameras and crammed all their best features into the S6000.  If you are a point-and-shoot photographer, this camera is fantastic, but if you like to push the enevelope with a camera (like I do), this camera will go right along with the program.  The camera is nice and small and can be slipped into your shirt pocket very easily so I always have it with me.  Battery life seems to be fantastic too.

I have had it for about a year now, and it has been on many adventures.  It takes great pictures, and I have captured many great moments with it.  I felt compelled to write this review because the lens will no longer open and the camera has been rendered useless.  To be fair, the camera has been used in more rugged environments that what many people would encounter (rock climbing in particular).  But if you are someone who is active and plans to take this camera into similar environments, be warned.  The mechanical lens components are very fragile and even the slightest hit can prevent them from functioning properly.  I was about as cautious as you can be with a camera in such environments, and still within 1 year it is unusable and I am forced to go camera shopping once again.  I have discussed this issue with others who have owned similar CoolPix models and it seems to be a common thread.

For heavy-duty photo shoots for production or for art I use my Nikon D 300S and get all the great control that you get with the big equipment scene and I love the results.  However, for quick before and after shots or for documenting product issues in my window fashions business I have found the little coolpix cameras to be indispensable.In fact, I just purchased my 4th little coolpix.  This one.  My first coolpix was the P4, purchased back in 2004 or 2005.  I carried it in my briefcase to all prospective customer sites and recorded everything from beginning to end with it.  The 'scenes' were a crucial factor in successfully shooting window dressings, as I could go from the museum setting to the backlit setting to really capture the room.  Awkward details that present challenges?  Instantly converted to close up and got great clear shots of uneven trim, out-of-square corners and obstructions.  It was considerably more rugged than I had any right to expect from a small inexpensive camera.  The design business is full of heavy sample books and ladders that get jumbled together in the back of a van, but the little camera just put up with the abuse.I loved the little camera so much that I purchased the s6000 for my sister and my installer so that they could get the same great detail shots with no training.  It is really incredible the quality of photos we have for every job we do with very poor conditions--low light and frequently high levels of dust.  The photos are almost always great for what they are.  We have great portfolios of every job.  Not magazine ready, but good enough to sell new customers on what we can do for them.Recently I dropped my little P4 for the last time.  I had no hesitation about getting another coolpix.  I tried another one in the series but returned it after only 30 minutes because the features just weren't suitable for what I needed.  I returned the newer model and found this slightly older model.  I have used the ones I gave to others and know it will be perfect for what I need.", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Little Camera", "Author": "C.

My photos were as good as a DSL camera my friend brought with. I am amazed and may never go back to using my bigger camera (except to a trip to see the polar bears this fall as I will definitely need the best zoom lens).

The camera is simplistic in design so that even the digital camera newbie can quickly learn to take good pictures with it. The camera is compact enough to fit into a pocket and lacks any external attachments that might get lost or be in the way. Basically, you pick up the camera, turn it on, select the appropriate scene setting and snap away at your subject. The 7x zoom is generally enough for the quick photo of a landscape or a portrait, and for the times the optical zoom isn't quite enough, the 14 megapixel file size allows a fair amount of digital zooming without degrading the picture quality. After two years of regular use, this camera is still working flawlessly.One recommendation I would make to anyone buying this camera is to buy at least one extra battery (I bought two) and keep it charged and in your camera bag at all times. The one disadvantage of buying a camera that takes a special battery is that you can't just run into a store and buy another one if you discharge the one battery you have and you don't have the time or place to recharge it.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everething Good", "Author": "Pierina", "ReviewID": "R1G3XXCJHXH9BN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelente camara! \u00datil para fines recreativos y tur\u00edsticos.
