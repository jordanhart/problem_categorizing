Night visions isn't that great at all though, and can't really see license plates or make out faces that are over 50' away. Good enough for what I wanted.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worst cctv equipment ever", "Author": "airbornexvii", "ReviewID": "R2URELFKIBSP8Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Well first the equipment don't have a power on off bottom, so everytime you have to turn it off or on you have to unplug the power cord. The instruction manual its not enough, need more details. The equipment get tripped almost all the time. The bullet cameras that came with it got a really bad picture, doesn't have real true colors so they are crap and the brackets that came with it are cheap and one of them came broken. The support on the Zmodo website it's vague and doesn't have to much support for the equipment they just have the same manuals that came with the dvr box for download online. Try it to upgrade for another zmodo remote control with the on off option bottom on it but no even the zmodo website have it for sale.I would never ever buy any other ZMODO equipment.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.99", "Features": "8 CH H.264 Surveillance DVR without a Hard Drive.
