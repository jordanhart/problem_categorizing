{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good camera for the money", "Author": "M. Santina", "ReviewID": "R2DUXPN6IP44FN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first impression of this camera was its cheap!  Coming from a metal cased Casio the Samsung is very light weight and feels of cheap plastic.  Nothing like the solid build feel of a galaxy phone or similar Samsung \"plastic\" product. Getting past the initial impression the phone started to grow on me.  It has a lot of good features; split screen shots, front display, wifi so you can back up directly to a computer, send via e-mail or share on facebook.  Transferring pics is very slow and you can only do 6 at a time(e-mailing)but its nice to have if you're not in a time crunch.  I have not printed out any photos yet but viewing them on the computer they look very clear.  When taking shots I did notice that the \"Smart\" setting didn't always pick the best setting and some of the pictures came out dark.  I ended up making a custom setting that worked best.  The only other complaint was that the menu could be more user friendly.  You have to go throught all the settings and options.  There should be a one click solution to go to picture settings or 1 click for wifi etc.  Different folders not just 1 big one.  All in all I wasn't looking to buy a high end camera and for $129 with 8GB card, tripod, case and more included in this bundle this was a great buy.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "very nice for the $$", "Author": "M.

Takes great pictures and videos in many different conditions. Lightweight and compact. The product was great, had some trouble with beach camera sending stuff. Didn't have everything in the box and he camera was defective. They sent a new camera which worked fine, but had to send a third box with the missing items. Kind of unorganized feeling, but ended up with everything (after a month and several phone calls).", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera but didn't get what was promised!", "Author": "CHERYL MAVEETY", "ReviewID": "R1IMGO7QK8P0NF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love the camera but the memory card that was included didn't fit so we had to go buy a new one.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not happy", "Author": "Penny Anderson", "ReviewID": "R1CCZL2BOJWI6A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It showed an extra battery came with the camera but their was a tri pod instead.
