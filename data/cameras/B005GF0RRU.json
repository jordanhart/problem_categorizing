{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great value package", "Author": "M. Schuck", "ReviewID": "R3UQPCNYY2M202", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think you get good value for you money with this package.I was surprised that it came with three batteries (one canon and two from another brand).The bag is just ok, I think I will get a better one. But it's ok for the start.Haven't used the flash yet, but looks cheap.It came with two chargers. One is the canon charger which comes with the camera. The travel charger has a US power plug connector, an additional adapter which  fits at least in Germany and a car adapter.The table tripod is a different one than in the picture. It's one of these with the flexible three legs, each leg around 10cm.The USB SD-Card Reader is a different one thank in the picture. The one I received looks better.What I'm missing are small bags to put the lenses in. The two small lenses (wide angle and macro) come with a small protection bag. But there is no bag for the two big lenses.The camera itself is absolutely great.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$737.00", "Features": null, "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T3i SLR Digital Camera Kit with Canon 18-55mm IS Lens + Canon 55-250mm Is Lens + Wide Angle Macro Lens + 2x Telephoto Lens + 3 Pc Filter KIT + 16GB SDHC Memory Card & Much More!!", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61le3mFC08L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005GF0RRU"}}
