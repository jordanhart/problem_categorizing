{"Reviews": [{"Title": "nice kit and camera so far", "Author": "Drew C.", "ReviewID": "R21PZRGX15RN1C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Until this purchase I have had only Sony Point and Shoot camera's, which for the most part I have been happy with, but it was getting time to replace the old Sony and had been considering the DMC-ZS3 for some time.  As I was researching that model, the DMC-ZS7 had come out to good reviews and had addressed a few problems with the ZS3.  So far the camera seems nice, has worked well and performs equally well to other P&S; camera's I have owned.  Probably the best attribute I have seen on the camera is the zoom, it really zooms well and the pictures come out clear and focused.  The biggest downside (if you want to call it a downside) is that this camera is complex with a lot of functions and very little instruction.  Most things I have learned just through trail and error.  I have seen other reviews about the mode dial moving easily and unexpectedly and that has happened to me, now I just remember to check it.  Overall I like the feel of the camera, the weight, construction etc...I like the 3in LCD screen (although hard to see in bright light like all P&S; camera's).  The kit was nice with the accessories; as it was not a whole lot more expensive than just the camera.", "Date": "May 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Pictures", "Author": "S. McCain \"TvGal\"", "ReviewID": "R3RD28HE6TM3WK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We buy a camera to take pictures and we want sharp crisp photos. This Lumix produces top quality photos. It's so easy to use, even a cave-woman can do it. The zoom in and out feature is right at your fingertips just before you're ready to shoot. I opted for the whole HDMI bundle, it was the best value for the money. It even came with a tripod. Leica makes top quality lenses and this Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 12.1 MP takes the sharpest pictures I ever took on a digital camera. My bundle came with this jump drive looking gadget that is actually a card reader. So you simply take the SD card out of the camera, insert it into the gadget and insert into the computer just like you would insert a jump drive. Upload the photos and then just delete which ever photos you want to off of the SD card. My bundle came with 8GB SD card and a nice carry-bag (and so much more). I haven't tried the video yet. The GPS is a cool feature for travelers.  I think I would invest in a reserve battery. I simply love this digital camera!", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 Camera", "Author": "FANTACIE", "ReviewID": "R3A93LDJ279Y9E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has great zoom.
