Very satisfied with the combination of Canon T3i with the upgraded 18-135 zoom.  Also nice to get a UV filter and hood for the lens with the package.  The 16GB memory card is fast and the tripod is sturdy and well built.  The one-stop-shopping kit + combo at Willoughby's was a great find.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "gopi", "ReviewID": "R372B8CI8UO3ZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I cant say how good is my purchase. Everything I have received are in excellent condition. Extra battery is certainly helpful. Canon bag is awesome. Lens is super good. I like the tripod, it is sturdy and helped me a lot. This camera has awesome video capture capability even in bad light. Its auto mode is perfect and newbies. I am very lazy to change lens, so this lens is great for me. I highly recommend this bundle and seller.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Product", "Author": "Harrison Chin Hing", "ReviewID": "RUN5DITQJJLLU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS LensThis Canon T3i is an excellent camera with lots of features, I am still going through the manual after 3 weeks of using it.After coming from the old Canon AE1, this was a new experience, but quite easy to follow the manual, although I also bought the book by Charlotte K. Lowrie - Canon T3i Digital Field Guide.The bundle i got was with the 18-135mm lens kit and it arrived with everything including the tripod, extra battery and cleaning kit. I am happy with the purchase and would definately purchase from this supplier and amazon again.
