I try every piece of electronic equipment before I give it. I was surprised. It took me only 2-3 minutes to get familiar with the camera's operation out of the box (no instruction reading). I found it's set-up to be very intuitive without the massive confusing menu system of - oh - lets say the CANNON POWERSHOT A560.Set up the camera mode on a dial switch.turn flash on/off/auto at a single button.point-click-picture. And nice ones too.small problem - the picture stabilization mode only seems to work when the flash is used. When the flash is on, you can violently shake this camera all over the place and it will capture the crispest image when it goes off, even your shoes or ceiling if you're shaking it that violently.Using a 4GB sandisk sdhc card, on maximum 10mp, the camera says it will hold just under 2000 pictures on the counter. On minimum 1.2mp setting, the counter stops at 9999. Yes, nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine. The numbers don't add up to me for MP size and # of photos, but if upscaling is used ( as I've read from others) , then these picture quantities do start to make sense.Between the Cannon power shot and another hard to use upscale Sony camera, both my mother and sister  wanted this one for ease of use. What they actually want.My neice looooooooooooves this camera.Takes about 45min of video too.If you want wall sized pictures - this is not for you.Full page picture - It can handle pretty well.4x6 memories - I don't think anyone can go wrong.", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Sally Pace", "ReviewID": "R1LLC657WCKI5Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works well, although a bit slow to recover after a pictures.

I ordered it on Friday evening and paid the extra for next day shipping. It got to my house about 5pm the next day. I was so excited.I read EVERY review of this camera on here. I was a little worried about the battery life so I bought a ton of batteries just in case. The picture quality is amazing, The features are very fun and very simple to use. The batteries that came with it only lasted about 2 hours. I put fresh Energizer brand batteries in and I was very surprised at how long they lasted. We took several videos at least 3 minutes long or longer and about 60 pictures and they still had about a 1/4 of a charge left. The only thing I agree with everyone on is the lack of an external speaker for the videos is a bummer.My boyfriend who worked in photography for many years loves it. He plays with it all the time just for fun.The only tip I have is don't use the cord that comes with the camera to download the pictures. Simply remove the card and download directly off the card to your computer. It will save on your batteries and it cuts the download time in half or more. Im not overly excited about the Kodak software, as I have used it I am getting better at it but I still don't think it is very user friendly.I would recommend this camera to anyone just wanting to document some fun times and memories with friends.

Batteries are always a challenge.  I strongly advise using Utlimate Energizer batteries (lithium) which have a long life although expensive (2-3 bucks). I tried using rechargeable batteries but they were so undependable I gave up and went to the Energizers.

I must tell you he thought this camera did a great job of doing everything he wanted.  Close up pictures were wonderful.  Color perfect.  Ease of use was a wonderful feature and each and every photo came out beautifully.  Batteries lasted a long, long time.  Now, I use it for all kinds of photo taking and love it!

You got to really stock up on the Energizer Ultimate AA batteries.The first digital camera I had was a Polaroid a530 Digital Camera back in 2009. In 2010, the Polaroid Digital Camera had fell and dropped to the floor so hard (ceramic tile) that it had cracked the screen and broke.

The sun was so bright with no shade that I couldn't see a thing out of the preview screen (yes this was annoying but I've noticed that even a lot of more expensive digitals don't have separate view screens these days), and the wind was fairly strong so I know that many times I wasn't able to hold the camera very steady.  So basically I was taking photos blind and shaky especially toward the end when I stopped even trying --  yet out of fifty shots I took only *one* was in need of deleting (it was an indoor shot where I manually turned the flash off and didn't have a steady enough grip to prevent blurring the first time, I retook and 2nd one came out fine).  I was very impressed, great shots for little effort.  Even without using the setting for reducing blur from camera shake they were all crisp and clear.  It did go through batteries fast at first, but having read the reviews here I bought the lithium and they are still going strong after the whole day.  I recommend setting the camera for auto shut off at three minutes, and using a card reader not the camera to transfer photos to your PC; you can also set the screen brightness to power save, all these things will help extend battery life.  I specifically made sure I bought a camera that took regular batteries, so I could take pictures anywhere, any time, and not be stuck on a trip with the inconvenience of needing recharge time.

What I wanted was a small, easy-to-use, non-comlex point and shoot that my son 9-year old son could use so he would stop using my camera.  The C180 delivers on that and more.Physically, it's perfect to slip in an adult's pocket or for a kid's hands.  Nothing fancy; quite boxish-looking at that.  Good screen and no optical view finder, but again, we are looking for simple.  Buttons are easy to use and well arranged.  All-in-all, a good sturdy feel to this camera.But what really sets the C180 apart is that it takes great pictures.  I caught a shot of my son in mid-air on his skateboard and it's perfect.  I was surprised that a low-end camera would capture such a shot, and the colors are really vivid.  I would probably recommend rechargeable batteries, though.The bottom line is that my son was taking shots within a minute of getting it out of the box, and the pictures are really quite good.  For me, now when I do things where I might be worried about camera safety, the C180 gets the call instead of my camera.  Cheap, easy to use, great shots, and I'm not going to be too upset if it gets broken.

I downloaded the latest easyshare software from the Kodak website, so i could upload short films to Youtube and i must say uploading was a breeze. My only beef was it eats batteries, but for fifty dollars i don't think i would have gotten a rechargeable camera for that price. I have lots of rechargeable batteries already, so this shouldn't be a problem. I would recommend this camera for someone who just needs to take pictures, a first camera for a teenager or so.

I'm happy because I read reviews ALL the time. Actualy I read the reviews BEFORE buying this camera and I was under a different impression.Basically I've just got off the phone with a Kodak representative because last night I was using my camera in a low light environment and I realized how \"cheap\" everything looked. The flash barely helped since it was a big room and my pictures from 6 feet of distance were poor and dark. I would have to be VERY close for the flash to actualy do it's job. Also a feature that most cameras nowadays have is the one where you softly press the shutter button and I will give you a red light to point BEFORE the flash. I thought this camera had but it doesn't. If you are in low light setting (let's say... birthday party) you're on your own and you would have to guess what are you shooting. Quite a bummer to be honest.Overall the pictures outside are good, but indoors and low light are not. Now I know (from Kodak website) that I have to adjust the iso thingy. But still the fact that it will be dark until the flash comes on downgrades the camera BIG time for me.I would think twice now before buying a camera online before seeing it first on a store.Overall I paid under $100 for it, I wasn't expecting much.
