{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worst IT Product I have ever attempted to Install", "Author": "ABVIworker", "ReviewID": "R1V1JAJSFJL1DH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have over six years experience in everything IT from desktop support to telecommunications.This camera is the most frustrating piece of equipment to install.(1)I bought this product under the title of \"Y-cam White SD, Network Camera, WiFi, MicroSD (YCW003) \" Which is misleading. Is it a micro SD that is needed or an regular SD to store the video? Turns out after I got it in the mail, its a micro SD. I already bought one SD card with the purchase but that is now useless since I need a micro SD.(2)How do you I set it up so you can confirm it records to the micro SD card? No clarifications in the Manuel!(3)How much can be stored in a GB on a micro SD card so I know how often to switch cards ? No clarifications in the manuel!(3)Where do I go to get the Y-cam app? No clarifications in the manuel!(4)When installing I could not log into the device. Why? Needs a firmware upgrade. The Manuel gives a general address, but doesn't specify exactly where to go.(5)Logged onto the website for help and was told that this device is \"discontinued.\" If I knew that before I bought the thing, I wouldn't of bought it. Why was this not indicated/disclaimed on Amazon from the seller?!(6)Tried creating a domain so I can view my equipment wirelessly...Manuel refers you to a third party (domain is free, which is good), but doesn't accept my password to connect to the camera. Reset password multiple times, called the service from the third party only to get a voicemail asking me to leave my number.It shouldn't take over four hours to set up a camera wirelessly should it?!?!(7)Checked out the Y-cam app for the ipad, (which is also the reason why I bought this) and its got 50/50 (shady) reviews. One person loves it, another hates it and says it doesn't work well on the iphone.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$174.99", "Features": "High quality remote viewing via any computer or internet enabled smartphone\nLow light recording for 24 hour surveillance\nQuick and simple set-up on both PC & Mac\nNAS-Ready - direct recording to any NAS drive, including Synology, Netgear, Buffalo\nView remotely from anywhere on iPhone, Android and Blackberry with free Y-cam apps", "Name": "Y-cam White SD, Network Camera, WiFi, MicroSD (YCW003)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417B4NDIZBL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002JM2BBS"}}
