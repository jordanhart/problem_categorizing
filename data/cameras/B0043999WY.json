They still look great at normal view. It also takes good video but it's not HD quality.

Pictures look better taken at medium rather than short range.  The advertised \"anti-shake\" technology sometimes fails to live up to its promise, so I've learned to take several shots whenever possible in order to pick the best later.  Otherwise it met or exceeded all my expectations.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "Jan", "ReviewID": "R6D2YA7PQNS5J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice little camera to use for what I need it for.

This must be a fairly durable because it's still in one piece, after several weeks of him using it. It also takes very clear pictures. I would highly recommend this camera if you are looking for something inexpensive that takes good pics. Also, since it comes with a small amount of memory on the camera itself, we were able to not use the memory card we bought for it, which he kept taking out and putting in backwards. The much cheaper quality Vivitar I had ordered before this one and returned required you to use a memory card. So, my son has fun with it taking pictures with the memory on the camera itself. It's really a great little camera for a young child. It's way cheaper than the \"toy\" ones I was looking at, and I'd prefer him having a real camera anyway.", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Vivitar Digital Camera", "Author": "C. A.
