{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's almost all I expected it to be!", "Author": "M. Prince \"The CoffeeGeek\"", "ReviewID": "R30VTEQ99UNE96", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So the deal is, I shoot photography in a professional capacity. I recently moved to all digital in my SLRs, which has resulted in some pretty satisfying results. I get awesome picture quality, superb tools for post processing, and no longer really have to hassle with developing film. But one thing was missing... convenience and portability.My pro kit bag weighs in at about 17 pounds fully loaded. My camera and lens of choice weighs in at over four pounds just on its own, and it's hardly what I'd call pocketable. So I started searching for an ultra small, ultraslim camera to do the trick.My search took me to a variety of \"influencer\" sites including dpreview and others. I read like a madman. I looked at picture quality. I read comments by current users. And I weighed positives against negatives. My choice was narrowed down to the Pentax Optio s4 and I was about to buy, when I found out the new s4i was coming out. It made my choice a lot easier. I'll outline more below.I placed a preorder on Amazon, and took delivery of one of the first shipping models. I guess that's extreme early adopter for you - the camera wasn't even supposed to be available till April 1, but I had mine in my hands by April 2. I've used it for five days now, and while that's a short time to evaluate something, it's long enough for me to give it a thumbs up. Here's what I like:Extreme Small Size: This is one of the smallest digicams on the market, but it's ruggedly built with lots of aluminum and metal surfaces.Large (relative) LCD: a big step up from the s4 is the 1.8\" LCD on the s4i. May not seem large, but considering the small size of this camera, it's massive.Streaming Video: very important feature for me. My previous digicam (before I went dSLR) was an Olympus C-5050, and I loved the fact I could fill a memory card with one long video. This one lets me do it too.Image quality's okay: at ISO 50 and 100, images are good, colour tone is decent. At 200 it's losing me, and at 400, it's terrible, but at least it goes to 400 ISO. The lens quality's okay too - nothing's changed from the s4 model, and the sample images you can find online show it's a decent snapshot capture device.\"Stupid\" Modes: Normally I'm not a fan of what I call \"stupid\" modes - you know, put the camera into a mode where the camera makes decisions for you (ie Museum mode, Night shot mode, Portrait mode), but I like the versatility in some of the modes on this camera. My faves so far: 3D mode, food mode (works well!), text mode and digital filter mode (I like taking a picture of myself as someone skinny!).\"Lifestyle\" Features: on top of being a digicam, this camera has additional lifestyle perks. It has a capable audio recorder mode (which I plan to use while conducting interviews for articles I write). It has a world clock function (though accessing it is a bit of a pain, unless you map it to the quick button). It has not one, not two, but three alarms, which can be set for once or daily (hey nice feature - a $350 travel alarm clock!).There are some negatives:Shot to shot performance: in a word, it blows. This thing can take a first shot quick (lag time is very short). But in \"high speed\" frame mode, you're lucky if you can get one shot every two seconds or more. Maybe if you have it set to manual focus or something.CCD is tiny = Grain, Chromatic distortions: because the CCD inside is so small, you end up with pictures with grain in continuous colour areas, and you see a lot of purple fringing in photos with high contrast.It may be too small: I've got big mitts. This thing feels like it's so small, it may fall out of my hands at times. The textured alum on the front helps though.Overall.I wasn't expecting a camera that could rival a Nikon D70 or a Canon Eos Digital Rebel in image quality, and you shouldn't either. But if you want a good quality camera for taking snapshots, movies, recording audio (sounds good too), and something you can wear around your neck or make disappear in your pocket, this is the model to beat. I'm very happy with the purchase.", "Date": "April 7, 2004"}, {"Title": "Reasons to consider the Pentax S4i", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R19IP3Q5UX90MQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here are reasons why the Pentax S4i should be considered:1) SMALL AND LIGHT- Smallest not only by linear dimensions (also is the smallest by cubic inch 'bulk' as well ) and weights only 4.2 oz WITH battery and memory card.  All with a large 1.8\" screen.2) AVAILABILITY - It is so easy to carry around that I don't leave it behind in the hotel room (how many times have you left your camera in the hotel room while out dining because it isn't acceptable to carry a full sized camera to dinner or other events...and lost the opportunity to capture pictures?)3) SHUTTER LAG and SHOT-TO-SHOT SPEED - Unlike other digital cameras...captures the picture as intended.  Hardly any shutter lag (0.1 sec).  Also important to me is that the time between shots is minimal with the internal buffer.4) LITHIUM RECHARGABLE BATTERY - Some prefer standard \"AA\".  I do not as the \"AA\" will allow less than 50 shots compared to the 200 shots I can get on a single charge.  Why is that important?  I hate to carry multiple spare batteries...and \"AAs\" are heavier (just as an example...holding four \"AAs\" alone feels as heavy as the Pentax S4i fully loaded with battery).5) SECURED DIGITAL MEMORY CARDS - The cards are cheaper in price than Xd or Memory Sticks.  My recommendation ... Panasonic brand high speed SD cards...which are known to be quicker than other brands (Panasonic data transfer write speeds of 10mbps ...which is quicker than the high end SanDisk Ultra II speed of 9mbps).  [Another thought... 4-megapixel is plenty to obtain beautiful 11x14 prints.  Choosing a higher megapixel camera is not necessary as most prints will be made below poster size and all the higher megapixel does is fill up your memory card faster].6) TELEPHONE SUPPORT - Call Pentax customer support at 800-877-0155 and you will see.  Not only for customer support...but technical knowledge and product selection.Suggested accessories:** Spare battery** Fitted authentic Pentax leather case with storage pockets for accessories.  Model PTX-L40.  Bought mine at Walmart.com for $19.34.  Also sold at Ritzcamera.com and Amazon.** Memory cards (I view it as a positive that Pentax is not including a memory card other than the included 10 mb internal memory.  This compares to many manufacturers that are providing a 16mb memory card...which will fit 16 shots at 4mp and are basically unusable).  (Suggestion....Pansonic brand secured digital cards are known to be quicker and higher performance than other brands.  Buy several 256mb cards.)** And yes...an Altoid tin for storage (Fits in the tin and it does close tight for storage.  Just have to shape the box by 1/16\" with your thumb on the initial use to make room for the wrist strap eyelet.  No big deal).My best suggestion is to study this camera in person.  You will not be disappointed.I highly suggest the Pentax S4i for any traveler...as well as any parent...who wishes to have a very well engineered camera available...which will last for years to come.", "Date": "July 6, 2004"}, {"Title": "Super-Ultra-Sub-Compact!!!", "Author": "JMC \"RockStone\"", "ReviewID": "R3E1H8AHN9MA7A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fantastic camera. This camera is probably the smallest one in the market today (I consider it smaller than the new slim Sony T1, which is only thinner (just a bit) but much wider). Pentax loaded this small machine with more functionalities that you can even imagine: B&W, sepia, green photos without the need to use a photo editor. Shoot in museums, snow, portrait, landscapes, sun, night, etc, by just selecting the appropriate occasion on the display and the camera will automatically adjust the exposure and speed. Good battery, won't die on you in the middle of the day.The only cons until now is that it may be too small! Watch out not to leave it on a restaurant table!Suggestion: Buy the pentax case PTX-L40. You'll pay a little premium on this case but it fits the camera well so that you do not buy a small camera and put it on a huge case (buy a huge camera then!).If you are looking for portability, without lacking functionalities (optical zoom, 4 megapixels, good battery life) this is the way to go.

She wanted a Large screen and for it to be easy to use for good photos.I wanted it to take good pictures, have a real Macro mode (around 2 inches), remote (a  $30 option) + video out (for family portraits), Manual focus, good low light focusing, and to be a fast shooter, Tripod Mount and a good battety life.This Pentax Optio S4i does all this and more and it is incrediably easy to operate. Not just the basics, even the more advanced features.  I  considered its almost twin the Casio Exilim EX-Z40 (same lens)but worse menus, (Casio has No remote option or video out), but it has a 2 inch sreen instead of 1.8 (both screens are same Resolution though) the casio does have an almost double life battery that so far is not available separtely for eihter camera (the two take the same batteries).  Basically the Batteries last about 300 shots, the old around 150 (710ms vs. 1230mA [the battery model #s are D-LI8 and NP-40] Addiitonal and OEM and third party ones are $18 to $40).If it matters pentax is actually also smaller then casio about 2/3 the size.Also considered Sony T1, and all Minolta's Dimage X/t/i/g and of course Canon's Elph series.  For me they were all lacking a feature or two or three+ (Be it Macro, Tripod mounts, remotes or more).You can go to reads reviews on dcviews.com (a meta site for news and other review and news sites).

I began to have some second thoughts after I started using it, though.Pros:* Ultra-small and lightweight. Goes anywhere!* Easy to use* Fairly intuitive menus* Fast, very little shutter lag* Pretty good picture quality, overall* Sturdily built* LCD screen is big and brightCons:* It's almost TOO small -- a little hard to get your hands on.* Some barrel distortion is noticeable* Flimsy little rubber cover over PC/AV port* In very low-light conditions, both viewfinder and LCD become unusableAfter a week of playing with the Optio, I decided to buy a Kodak DX7440 for comparison, and spent a week trying them side by side. The Kodak is considerably better ergonomically because it's bigger and fits in my hand better, has a more powerful flash, shows less barrel distortion, offers many more scene selections and manual override controls, and its menus are (amazingly) even easier to use than the Optio. The Kodak cameras are often praised in reviews for their picture quality. But I actually found the Optio's pictures better than the Kodak's in most cases. The Kodak produced rather garish, unnatural-looking colors, whereas the Optio seemed to render colors more naturally and realistically. And although I like the feel of the Kodak in my hand, in the end I decided that its relative bulk would make it a lot less likely that I would actually carry it around and use it.Bottom line:  I'm returning the Kodak and keeping the Optio S4i.For a go-anywhere, easy-to-use, point-and-shoot camera, it's great!", "Date": "August 17, 2004"}, {"Title": "Absolutely the best!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RU7AQAVXGE0LJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to start off saying how much I love this camera.  I've had a few digital sub-compacts over the last few years, with the last being the Casio Exilim series.  This camera totally beats all of the Exilim's hands down!  I am VERY impressed with how good the camera's pictures are!  This is probably the most noticeable thing right off the bat.  On my old Exilim, the pictures were kind of dark and fuzzy around the corners, but not so with the Optio S4i!  This camera is wonderfully easy to use and packed full of features.  Even though I read the manual from cover to cover, the menu's are so simple and intuitive, I could have used it without any manual reading. To my surprise, this camera even records sound in Movie mode, something most of the Exilim's don't.  The movie mode even appears \"smoother\" than the Exilim's, despite the fact that they both take pictures at 15 frames/second.  Overall here is what I liked and didn't like:Pro's:-Outstanding pictures and quality (most important)-Extremely easy to use-Packed full of nearly every feature you can think of-Movie mode comes with sound-Ability to look at pictures on T.V. (can't with Exilims)-Very large LCD screen on back of camera-Small size makes easy carrying and encourages more pictures-Macro mode is just unbelievable - 3\" - WOW!Con's-LCD screen is \"washed out\" in bright sunlight, but then again, I haven't found a camera LCD that didn't do this, just some are better than others.-Battery life could be a bit better! About comparable to the Exilim series.-If one takes pictures to battery depletion (which I always do), you must recharge the battery first in order to download the files to your computer.  The battery charger which comes with it only charges the battery, you cannot download the files while the camera is attached to the charger.  This is a cheap shot from Pentax in making the customer shell out another $50 for the optional AC adapter to avoid this quirk.- If you use a \"normal\" non-high performance SD card, (which I use), there is considerable lag in continuous picture taking since the file has to be read to the card prior to taking the next picture.  Shell out more money for a high performance card, and this will be greatly minimized.  In all fairness, though, the average user probably will not be using this camera for fast-paced \"action\" shots, so this is only a minor inconvenience!Overall, though the Pro's far outweigh the Con's, and I have to say that this is the best camera I have ever bought!  I highly recommend it!  I'll probably keep it until they get 6MP cameras this size. Given the current trend, (seems about 1MP per year), it should be in about 2 years!

After much research, I have not found another ultra-compact that even comes close in performance, features and small size to the S4i.  Currently, its closest competitors are the Konica Minolta Xg and the Sony DSC-T1.  The Xg is much larger and lacks many features which are available on the S4i. The only feature better on the Xg is its 320 X 240 @ 30 fps movie mode (320 X 240 @ 15 fps on the S4i).  The Sony is also much larger and has a much higher price tag.  Again the movie mode is better with the Sony-640 X 480 @ 30 fps.Pros:-Smallest ultra-compact available in its class-Excellent quality 4.0MP photos-Packed with features  -Nice Panoramic mode which provides you with a \"ghost\" image of  the previous shot to help you align the next shot.  -Very interesting 3D mode  -Excellent Super-Macro  -Many more modes to chose from-Strong aluminum alloy body has a solid high qualty feel in your hands-Large LCD screen-Plugs into your TV for a slide show-Charges battery in the cradle while battery is in the camera-320 X 240 @ 15 fps movie mode with sound.Cons:-Lack of control over shutter speed and aperture (only a concern for those who want complete manual control for depth of field effects and certain light conditions)Consider the Pentex Optio S40 if you want an ulta-compact that uses AA alkaline batteries.

As a professional digital camera workshop lecturers, my husband and I have a lot of experience with a wide assortment of digital cameras. We also own the Casio Z4U digital camera which is the competition to this digital camera. So we are not without a lot of knowledge and great deal of experience. The Pentax S4i is a major change from the Pentax S4. The LCD has been enlarged, a docking station is now a part of the package, and the ISO is now adjustable up to 400 ISO instead of the 200 ISO that is available on the Pentax S4. All in all the Pentax S4i is a much improved digital camera when compared to the Pentax S4. While the Casio Z4U measureably looses digital image resolution and quality when digital photos are taken in less than \"normal\" lighting conditions, where higher ISO settings are required, the Pentax S4i is able to handle increased ISO settings with many fewer problems. In the final analysis, the S4i is a better digital camera in our opinion than Casio's Z4U. However, please keep in mind that the Casio Z4U, while it cannot shoot video clips, does have a \"Best Shot\" capability which allows pre-set settings which are very convient, especially for beginner or novice digital camera users.

Instant review, various flash options, and a number of other color and light adjustments that can be made assure that you never take a bad picture. The video and sound recording options are also fun. As an added bonus, the super lightweight battery is rechargeable. I like that I can easily fill the memory card with one battery charge and then quickly recharge the battery for more use.

The best thing is that I can keep it with me in my purse and take pictures anytime.  It really makes you love taking pictures again.  I'm using it in the \"best\" picture mode, and both the 4x6's and the 8x10's I've produced are fabulous.  I had been hooked on my Elph (non-digital APS camera) because of the size and had all but stopped using my 35mm SLR, but this produces better pictures (especially closeups), has all the advantages of digital, and is a lot smaller.  A couple of reviews of this camera and its predecessor, the 4s, mentioned that 400 ISO pictures are noisy.  While that's true, you'd have to manually select 400 because I have yet to find any of the \"auto modes\" that choose 400 speed - most are done in 50 or 100 speed regardless of the light, and the shutter speed compensates (and/or the flash compensates). The night mode does a great job if you have a tripod or brace the camera (4 second shutter speed). So unless you want to take a lot of pictures of moving subjects in dim light, or can't hold the camera still, I can't see that it would be an issue for any point-and-shoot type of usage, indoors or out.  In comparisons with 8x10 closeup pictures from the Canon S400 and Nikon 4500, I'd challenge you to find any negative differences.  The \"flower\" mode does soften the sharpness a tiny bit, but I found it to be more aesthetically pleasing.  If you like it sharper, you can use another setting such as generic \"picture mode\" or \"landscape mode\".  (It's interesting to review the metadata information on the computer after taking shots with different settings and in different modes.  You can see how it adjusted the contrast, saturation, white balance, etc. in addition to the shutter speed/ISO info and more)  The best use I've had so far was last Saturday night when my son brought his date here to get prom pictures.  I took a few shots (reviewed them on the spot - retook one when I noticed it would look better if she wasn't holding her purse) then came inside, downloaded them, reframed one of them to be closer and printed them out before they left.  His date not only had some great pictures from the prom, she had pictures to take TO the prom!  Everyone was thrilled!By the way, I use MicroSoft PictureIt Professional and an HP 2210xi printer to print them, and have found the results to be fantastic.  Printing from the Optio software seemed to be fine too.

Amazon did not have any available at the time, so we bought locally.The camera was the perfect small size and light weight.  We found the hugh manual tiring to read and too many options to operate what is supposed to be a simple pocket camera.  But this was all ok, so long as it performed good.We shot many pictures and started printing some.  At first glance we thought, very good.  But we then started noticing that every picture, indoors or out (but primarily indoors) was slightly out of focus.  So, we took identical shots with this camera and our old fujifilm finepix 2 megapixel camera and printed both.  At this point we were very dissatisfied.  There was no comparison.  The fuji 2 MP pictures were beautiful and clear.  The Pentax 4 MP pictures were all relatively fuzzy and out of focus.  We tried again, using a tripod on the pentax camera.  Same results.  We then returned the camera for a refund.I called customer service, and they had no idea what I was talking about.  Said,  they never had a complaint like this before.  So, we took the $80 SD card purchased for this camera (which we could not return) and when back to the store, put in our sD card in their display model.  Took a lot of pictures in the store with it and also the Fuji camera.  When home and printed.  Found the same results.We learned a new lesson, that the number of megapixels is not the most important feature of a camera.  We believe that because of the miniature size of this camera, possibly the tiny CCD which captures the image is simply not of the best quality.  So, I magnified those images 100 times and found that colors were not correctly being duplicated.  For example, looking at a black picture frame in the pictures, on the pentax, only about 10% of the dots were black, the rest were mostly light purple or yellow.  On the Fuji camera, about 90% of the dots were black.Hope this is helpful to those concerned with crisp, clear pictures with vivid color.  I don't believe the Pentax Optio S4i can deliver on that.  Obviously, many people don't look that close at pictures and are only interested in glancing at snapshots.

When I got the camera, there is no power in the battery, so I had to recharge it, took about 1 hour or so, not too bad to recharge. The user guide is pretty straight forward and explains everything I want to know about aking pictures, different modes and shooting movies. And I can easily use it now without referring back to the book. I put in a 256MB SD card and at the second smallest size (pixel) setting combined with best quality (3 stars)-which is optical for printing out 4x6 pictures, you can take 450 pictures. At the higest setting for both size and quality with a 256mb card, you can take about 87 pictures. I find that really good, and since I usually don't print out anything 8x11, I would set it to a smaller size and get more pictures out of it. And to comment on a previous user about fitting into an altoids can. He is right the bulging part on the left where the strap holder is does make it a little difficult to fit it into the tin, but what i did was stretch the left side of the tin a little by my thumb, and now it fits nicely without being too tight. The top doesn't close completelyy due to an uneven surface but it closes enough so that it wouldn't pop open by itself. What I would do is to go to a candy or toy store to get a cute coin purse that's that size and put in there. Coin purse fabric is softer so I think would protect it more.

I haven't found a good case for it yet.3) The battery charge is easy to use, just plug the camera in; you can also charge the battery seperately.  But it takes a while to recharge.  Also, the charger is made of white plastic and just looked cheap.", "Date": "April 16, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great vacation camera", "Author": "Gellor", "ReviewID": "RKZQ51206YWG2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to take on vacation to New Zealand.  Its very easy to use.  Having never used many cameras before, I was able to figure out my way around this camera, its modes, and even began messing with exposure times.  The image quality is exceptional, especially for a camera that is so small and light that I sometimes forgot I had it strapped to my belt.The battery life was quite good.  I was able to take a couple hundred pictures with flash and display on before having to recharge.A couple of things to note, though.  The battery life indicator isn't very accurate.  When the battery started draining fairly low, I'd power on the camera and sometimes it would show that it was fully charged, sometimes it would show that it was about to lose power alltogether.Also, don't plan on taking either action or night shots with this camera.  The shutter delay (time between pushing the button and it taking the picture) was long enough that I missed taking a few shots that I really wanted.  (ie, a whale's tail as it was diving).  For night shots, there is a lot of noise on the images, and objects tend to blur a little.  (lacking detail on faces/etc)That aside, I'd still recommend it for point-and-shoot users that want a record of their vacation.  For the price and size, I couldn't be happier.", "Date": "December 4, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great little camera!", "Author": "Spiff", "ReviewID": "R1LM59KPUTRJ64", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd been thinking about buying a small digital camera for about 3 years. My girlfriend continues to impress me with her pont and shoot, on the go picture taking ability with her tiny camera. That's what I was looking for, a camera that disappears when you don't need it.I was originally looking at the Nikon 3100. However, while visiting in CA, I was introduced to the Optio S4i. What a small camera! And 1 megapixel more than the 3100. All for about $50 more (or more than that, now that the 3200 is out). I did some reasearch online that night and decided to buy it the next day.Have not been disappointed yet.The picture quality is very good (not the bestest). The lag time is negligable and I find the interface for the most part intuitive. It has a lot of handy modes to help one take a great picture. The idiot modes included in the camera's software are great! Makes a spontaneous picture look even better. I know that a lot of people gripe about not being able to manually control the camera, but his is not what this cameral was built for. It's built for take-along point-and-shoot fun where you don't have to think too hard. Continuous movie mode at 15 frames per second is also very nice. The size is also perfect. About the size of an Altoid can - slips into a pocket easily. Tamrac makes a great carrying case which accomidates the camera and a couple of SD cards.The only gripe I have with it so far is a minimal \"fishbowl\" effect that is only noticeable when a lot of straight lines are present (took a picture of a tiled floor). However, this is found in most point and shoot cameras (some more than others), so no big loss.Overall I'd say I am very satisfied. This camera will keep me happy taking pictures for a long time. When I get used to digital pictures, that's when I will go for the SLR, control everything camera. And even then, this camera will still be great for vacations and outings where a 17 pound camera bag is a third wheel.", "Date": "May 22, 2004"}, {"Title": "It was the best camera I ever had until the sand...", "Author": "Maria Angela Franceschini \"mari\"", "ReviewID": "R3OEPR1T58V2L2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got a Pentax Optios S4i camera last Christmas from Amazon and it worked really well until this summer.  First day on the beach, I started taking pictures of my daughter, when suddenly the camera stopped responding.  There was some wind and despite my precautions some sand must have gone inside the zoom mechanism.  By zooming in and out and then trying to turn off the camera a sand grain cracked the zoom and then entered in the lenses, blocking them.  The result was the camera didn't work anymore. All my picture went blank, overexposed.I called Pentax and was told that a digital camera is like a computer and shouldn't be taken to the beach. That sound really wrong to me, and in any event, the lenses part broke, not the \"computer\" part.You can imagine, though, that few people would buy this digital camera if they knew they could not take photos at the seashore.  I never read anywhere that sand damages are not covered by the warranty. I went to the Pentax Optios web page and first thing I saw was a picture of a kid with his dad playing on the beach. I found this totally misleading since people at Pentax told me if I wanted to bring the camera to the beach I should have bought a different camera possibly sand proof.Despite my complains to get my camera fixed I had to pay 110$. Actually 105$, I got 5$ discount because of the phone call.I'm stuck with this camera. I had a digital Sony before and never had problems with sand or dirt. This one is just too fragile.

I do have to say that Pentax Customer Service has been okay to me.  I bought the camera in April 2004.  Around Sept 2004, it just stopped working.  I was at a charity event, took it out of the case to snap a few photos, but it wouldn't operate.  When I pressed the power button, I got 2-3 beeps, a sound like the lens was trying to open, then the camera just powered off.  Then it started working again, at least for a while.  A month later I took it on a short weekend holiday.  Of course it stopped working there.  Sent back to Pentax for repair.  Got it back about 2 months later, repaired.  6 months later was going on another short holiday.  Took the camera out of the closet to confirm it still worked, and again was disappointed.  When powered up, the lens opened, autofocus failed, lens closed, and camera powered off.  Had to buy another digital camera (this time a Canon) for that trip.

The image quality of my Canon is much brighter and sharper than any of the images on the S4i.Couple of other things I don't like about the S4i.  The USB Cable isn't a standard size.  Why?  Also, you need to load the specific USB software to get XP to \"See the USB Storage Device\".  It should show up as a camera.  I didn't have this problem with the Canon s400.  This is Pentax's way to get the consumer from returning it once they've tried it.  All stores say that you can't return it once the software's open.  When I opened my camera the software was already opened so I'm sure I'll have fun returning this.

Sure, this camera takes great pictures, but that's no good to you if it breaks while on vacation.  I did NOT abuse this camera or drop it in the sand.  The sand probably came from a couple grains in my pocket (I was fully clothed wearing jeans, so it's not like I was in shorts lying down in the sand). I don't know if the seals have a bad design but why release a camera with such a poor design.  I would never buy another one of these again.
