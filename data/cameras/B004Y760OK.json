Everything works like it is supposed to, and almost all of the accessories are provided. I ordered a 32GB card and was only provided an 8 GB card.. that is disappointing, but since memory isnt that expensive anymore, not that big of a deal i guess. Also, I was supposed to receive a tulip lens shade. Didnt get that either. Otherwise, I did get everything that was promised to me. The Camera itself and the second lens and Macro lenses all work great. I will get a ton of use out of this camera overseas on deployment, but I dont think I will order from the Sunset Electronics again.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Love This Camera", "Author": "Ron", "ReviewID": "R35ZZYBZ7RULYT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just started using the camera a few days ago and this kit is almost everything I expected. I'm no professional and plan to use it to take alot of great amateur pictures. With all the extras included in this kit I feel I'll have great opportunities to try new ways to take photos.The only disappointment so far is the tiny camera bag that's included in this kit. There are so many extras that come in this kit that I bought a large camera bag and I'm using the included bag for the less used items so, nothing is wasted!Also, The tripod seems so light weight and flimsy but it has many advantages over it's larger, heavier and bulkier counterpart tripods. It's super transportable, don't take up any space to store and it is very quick to set up.Give me a few months to learn to use this camera and I'll post a new review.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "T4I is a better choice if you can afford a couple of hundred dollars more.", "Author": "Handgunner", "ReviewID": "R3TCNVI4PB84I6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was my second digital camera.. My first was a Minolta point and shoot. This was my intro into SLR cameras. Don't get me wrong, it's a great starter camera and has some great features but i did have to give the \"package\" 3 stars because of the accesories. The bag is too small to carry all of the things that come with it. The flash that fits on the on top of the camera did not work. It was a cheapie so I threw it out since the postage to send it back was more than it was worth. Lastly, It came with a wireless remote and this camera is not wireless.One more thing, the 75/300 mm lens does not have a stabilizer, but it is a kit lens and works well.One cool point for new SLR buyers  ...  It has an automatic setting that does all the thinking for you!  It turns your SLR into a point and shoot and takes great pictures! If you have the extra bucks, go for the T4i. It will do movies, same as the T4i, but has a built in Auto Focus. The T3i does not.Hope I was some help,  Handgunner", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "resumen", "Author": "jose francisco", "ReviewID": "R27JVGIKIYB8J1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "me gusto el producto,es justo lo que pedi y lo que decia el anuncio, es muy buena calidad y me llego a tiempo, felicitaciones  y gracias", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Kit", "Author": "Geonney", "ReviewID": "R3ALPW71UDE167", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was my first camera and It did its job.Even though its a the lower end of dlsr cameras I was able to pull of some pretty decent shots with it.I think the kit as a whole i would give an 7.5 out of 10.Tripod is trashHD and wide angle trashbag is small but it does its jobnever used the flasheverything else was pretty solid though", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Rip off", "Author": "Gerry Cheramie", "ReviewID": "R3QAXNSX4MJLIB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "A few of the lenses they came with this camera didn't even fit on this camera.
