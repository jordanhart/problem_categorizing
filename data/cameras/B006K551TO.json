{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "TechGuy", "ReviewID": "R3B8QVHKHB88S3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For some reason this was available in New Zealand, via Asia, before the US/UK release.  I've had it for about a week now.  So, it is as spec'ed in the preview comments about it so far from the various websites.It starts fast, focuses quickly, does not have shutter lag and is easy to handle and has tons of functions.  It handles well for its size and does not feel heavy. Having the zoom on the side of the lens is great - makes it more stable to hold the camera. I've taken some pretty amazing shots with it - the zoom allows good creativity and the low light capability produces detailed and pleasing shots.  How much different this camera is to the previous model I'm not really sure in terms of the additional megapixels via the new sensor. My previous camera was a Olympus E620 DSLR - in comparison there is less detail with the Sony, although not hugely noticeable on a 23\" LCD computer monitor. The camera is a lot of fun to use and it just begs you to be more creative when shooting. The partial colour shots are great. The LCD screen is very good, nice and bright. Nice touch to use the optical viewfinder and have the screen turn off. The built in user manual is great - to look up what a function does without having to refer to the manual.  Also when you find what you want it provides the option to go to that function right away - so for example I wanted to look at the ND filter function, once I've read what it does I can then select to open the function from the help screen rather than exiting help and then trying to find it through the menu system.It provides good flash coverage and the slow-sync function is great to prevent those deer in the headlights shots - as this flash can put out a lot of light.The superior auto mode is good for the stability/less blur in long range shots as it takes multiple photos and apparently works out which is the best photo to save.  This is great as at maximum zoom the camera shake from your hands can be a problem if you've ever experienced using a megazoom before. Personally without that image stabilisation and multi-shot taking having a megazoom is a bit pointless as you'd never take good photos at long range without frustration.Shooting movies and the ability to shoot a good sized still at the same time is very impressive - probably one of the best features - as I've always wanted to be able to take a high MP shot during a video shoot because that's when you typically need it and on other cameras it was always one or the other but not both at the same time. The video quality is very good. No issues there and the zoom works well when videoing.  The microphone does pick up background noise around the camera (ie from people talking nearby) and without a zoom mic option is somewhat limiting. That said the audio capture is good.Other good things - HDR - similar function to my iPhone 4S - produces good highlighting without overcooking the photo. When it is taking multiple photos with HDR and other functions it takes a few seconds time to process and save these but I guess thats normal. The menu system is good - particularly given how many functions this camera has.I use it with a Sandisk 32GB Extreme 32GB SDHC Flash Memory Card (Class 10).  Seems fine to use - saves quickly. It is probably better to get higher spec cards like this one if shooting HD video.On the downside... the lens cap can get stuck if you don't remove it before turning the power on. Flash - there's no button to pop it up as per usual cameras - you need to use the jog dial and select flash to get it to pop-up. Once set it then pops up the flash when needed. The LCD screen doesn't fully articulate but that is not a major for me.In summary it will never please the pro's out there - the image quality is very good but not perfect.  Good enough for most people wanting the \"best for me\" rather than \"best in the world\" class of camera - its affordable, has huge capabilities, more than acceptable image quality and fun. A family orientated camera for sure that everyone can pick up and use and get pleasing results (and compliments).There is a link to a few photos in the comments section (all handheld shots, no photo editing).  Have added some more photos - very pleased with the colour accuracy.A bit more on zooming in photo or video mode and focusing speed which is typically an issue with superzooms.  To me the Sony seems quick to focus at maximum zoom in photo or video mode.  We're certainly not talking more than a half a second to a second say from one subject to another at the far end of the zoom.  It's quick and smooth with no hunting zoom noises. Would be nice if someone else reviewed this camera to concur!", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V", "Author": "YnotMe", "ReviewID": "R9C4IAD1I7DX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I found myself wanting to up grade my super-zoom point and shoot camera. I had a Samsung HZ50W and wasvery happy with it, but I felt it was time for change.I read reviews from everywhere I could, from camera experts to everyday people, I decided on looking at fivecameras, Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V, Fujifilm FinePix HS30EXR, Nikon COOLPIX P510,Panasonic DMC-FZ150K, and Canon SX40 HS.I decided if I was spending $400 to $500 on a camera I was going to try them out in stores first. I like to buy thingsonline, but I don't like returning items, so off to the local shops.  First I'll have to say that I drove about 90 miles to look at cameras. Unfortunately I couldn't find 2 cameras, theFujifilm FinePix HS30EXR or the Panasonic DMC-FZ150K no one carried either one.I played around with the other 3 cameras quite a bit, all were very nice and I don't think I would have gonewrong with any of them. It was little things that made me pick the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V. The Canonhad I smaller screen and auto focus seem to struggle at times, plus 2 different sales people told me if you buya Canon get the extended warranty, although I don't see any issues like that in any reviews. The Nikon was nice butit seemed to miss a good shot more often, whether taking to long to focus or a little blurry.The Sony seemed to focus fast and get the shot way more often and the 3 inch screen was nice.. I have nowowned this camera for a week and can't stop taking pictures and video. I have tried to put this camera in everysituation possible and it has worked every time. So far I've taken pictures at my son's tennis meet, other son'sband concert, portraits, the dogs, flowers, landscape, low light, no light, bright light, very close, full zoom, burst modesand couldn't be happier. The video is great  , I still can't believe how smooth and detailed the video, I took of my sonsband concert, holding the camera by hand no tripod and at half to full zoom.I am an amateur photographer that takes about 100 to 1000 pictures a week and have for 15 to 20 years,we have had more cameras than I can count, including SLR - DSLR, point and shoot, and video cameras.As with every camera there are a few cons, The viewfinder is not very good, but I love that the camera switchesto it automatically when you go to look through it. Also no Raw image, my last camera had it and I was just startingto learn how it use it in editing. 29 minute video length limit? I don't know if that will ever be an issue, but why the limit.And I've never seen this on a point and shoot camera, but why can't we turn off the picture preview and have a liveview all the time, it would be much easier to follow the action whether in burst or single shot mode.I am very happy with this camera, and I can live with the few cons I found, Thanks for reading, hope this helps.", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony superzoom", "Author": "pcarnut \"Roger\"", "ReviewID": "RYXHCKB121TQZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wanted a superzoom with Panorama mode so the choices are fairly limited.  This week both the Sony HX200V and Nikon P510 came out so bought them both to compare.  The first review by \"techguy\" gives some nice details about the camera so I won't repeat his comments.  I've played with them now for a couple of days and do not claim to be an expert by any means so take these comments with a grain of salt.  These are just initial impressions.I found overall the Sony took nicer pictures than the Nikon which tended to give a slight yellow hue on grass.  And when enlarging the pictures the detail was better.  The Sony produced slightly clearer pics both indoors and out and skins tones were a little warmer and more natural.  The Sony also allows you to adjust the color and vividness to personal taste, don't believe the Nikon allowed for this.I did like the size and feel of the Nikon better, the menu was a little more user friendly I thought and so was the layout of buttons.  Start up time was about equal, although be aware with the Nikon if you choose to have it display the \"Coolpix\" icon it delays this by a couple of seconds.One feature I found very useful is the Sony tells you how much time remains in minutes, not just a bar graph, I hate running out of power unexpectedly.  Biggest gripe so far with the Sony is the power cord/charger. It's nearly as big as my laptop charger.  Wish they would do it like Nikon or Panasonic.  I travel on a motorcycle and space is very limited so this is a pain.Sony puts the Panorama mode on the top dial while Nikon buries it with the Scene mode and the view finder turns on automatically if you put your eye to it, both thoughtful touches.  I really wanted to like the Nikon more, mainly due to the better charger layout but in the end, good pictures is what it all about so the Nikon will be going back.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Brief Review", "Author": "Cookie Monster", "ReviewID": "R3KUYAKR5RLIWU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most likely you have already read professional reviews of this item, so I will not repeat the list of features. Here are bits of info that I didn't find in reviews when I was shopping, and had hoped someone would post, along with a few surprises I found:1- Once you turn off the annoying start up tone, it takes less than a second to be ready, a big plus2- There is a zoom/focus ring. It is electronic, I would have preferred a mechanical one but it works well. Zoom or focus selectable by a switch3- The sweep panorama mode works well with the exception of the fact that it has a fixed width. If you don't sweep far enough within the allotted time, e.g. because you don't want too wide a panorama, the rest of the image will be filled with a grey filler. I hope a firmware update will fix this as it looks hideous.4- Macro photos are not the greatest.5- Ability to select the mode automatically works well.6- When powered on, the extending lens struggles if lens cover is still on. Would have been nice if it were removed automatically (too spoiled, I know)7- The included charger is an in-camera charger. It can power the camera for use and also while connected to a PC. To charge an extra battery, you'll need to buy a separate standalone charger. While connected to a PC, the camera charges the battery through the USB port.8- Great camera. Amazon and Beach Camera are outstanding.9- The bundle from Beach Camera is great (Make sure to get the one with the 16GB card)I like the camera and will definitely keep it for years to come.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just OK", "Author": "deanie1", "ReviewID": "R1KDBOU7XSRSLL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this to replace an old Lumix which I loved, but broke.  It's definitely better than a three year broken bridge camera or a cheapo pocket point and shoot.  I know a little about cameras and have owned several, but am no pro.  I've had this for two weeks and have taken a ton of pics.PROS:1) Has about every feature that a bridge camera should have and then some, including HD video and some in-camera editing, which I haven't tested out.2) Super zoom capabilitiesCONS (or should I say, irritations)1) As a birdwatcher, quick focusing is essential, and this camera seems slow to hone in on a bird -- by the time it focused, the bird was sometimes gone.2) Too often poor ability to focus at all.  Switching to manual mode worked, but took time3) No useful user guide -- Yes, it's online, but you can't readily print it out.  You also can't buy one.4) The LCD screen smudges really easily and wiping it off with something handy makes it worse5) The viewfinder is pretty dark and sometimes doesn't show the whole scene6) Worse lens cap ever!  Pops off if you set the camera down wrong and half-way pops off and gets stuck if you accidentally turn the camera on with the lense cap still on.7)  Doesn't come with a lens hood or stand-alone battery charger.

We purchased this camera to capture action shots for our son's games and for better overall picture taking of family vacations.  We were contemplating stepping up to a DSLR however the added bulk and the learning curve were a detractor.  Thus I decided on a bridge cameraI spent hours reading reviews between this preorder, the HX100V, Panasonic FZ150 and Canon's SX40.  I chose this because of the HX100V reviews and knowing this would be an improved model along with a much better price found on buydig which also included a 16gb class 10 sony card and a generic case.I received it last night and we took some sample photos and videos in low light conditions and were very impressed!  It captured fine details such as shadows around a face and the photos simply looked 10x better than anything we've ever captured.  It's a true night and day difference.The learning curve on the camera doesn't seem to be all that terrible.  Most functions were easy to figure out.  There's also a built in manual in the camera which is useful.  The paper manual is very basic.  There are also a ton of youtube videos on the HX100v that prove useful in learning some of the advanced features.Regarding some of the other comments, yes the camera charger is huge.  It's similar to that of a laptop power cord brick.  However, the manual states you can charge the camera from the provided PC USB cord.  The camera takes a micro usb end.  This means it'll work with phone chargers!  You can even use your iPhone's charger.  Just plug in the Sony USB cord to the iphone charger and the other end to the camera.  Note: It may take longer to charge via this method, but is much more convenient.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Has features that others do not.", "Author": "RosieAndMe", "ReviewID": "R1Y0L1Z5FSE67S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are three cameras that one should consider the Canon Powershot SX40 the Panasonic DMC FX150 and then this one the Sony HX200V.Researching these three is interesting because you will find sites listing each of the three as the very best over the other two.  I think the bottom line is that any of the three will give good photos and satisfy the user.I purchased this camera because of two features that are largely ignored by the professional reviewers but to me they give this camera the edge over the others.  First is Sony's proprietary optical steady shot stabilization.  A good stabilization system is extremely important because no matter what the camera if you don't have good stabilization or a tripod then you have fuzzy pictures.  Here is what Techradar had to say in their review of the HX200V;  \"We got sharp results at maximum zoom from shot to subsequent shot when it was used handheld. That's almost unheard of on rival models.  On most superzoom rivals we've needed to take two or three shots of the same subject to arrive at one that wasn't soft.\"  The reader should go to the Techradar site review and then go to SAMPLE IMAGES.  The first photo is taken at wide angle and shows a long tree lined path ending at a distant white building.  The next photo was taken handheld at the same spot but now at full telephoto and WOW.  You now clearly see a fence that you did not see before and the paint is rusted in spots and there is an emblem on the fence that you can read.  Also go to SENSITIVITY AND NOISE.  Here you can see how the level of noise at different ISO settings effects the photos.  Which brings me to another subject.  Some professional reviewers point out that higher megapixels do not necessarily mean better photos because noise can increase depending on the CMOS sensor which is true but then they are completely baffled at why the Sony engineers increased the megapixels on this new camera.  Well I'm not sure either however I am sure they didn't make the camera worse than the competition but rather better.My second reason for selecting this camera is the Superior Auto Mode. This mode shoots multiple shots of the same scene in rapid sequence and then creates the best single picture as a composite Here is what Squidoo says in their review; \"Get cleaner, more dynamic pictures and fewer missed shots. The DSC-HX200V automatically recognizes the correct scene mode, then quickly shoots and combines up to six shots to produce images with greater clarity, optimum dynamic range using backlight correction HDR technology and lower image noise using 6 shots layering technology. Superior Auto intelligently detects 33 scenes for still images and movies, making it easy to get the best shot.\"  If you Google tumblr HX200v you will see sample photos of the Superior Auto Mode which are impressive.So did the camera meet my expectations, yes it did.  The stabilization worked as advertised however the lens does have limitations.  It works best in bright light.  The alternative would be stepping up to a more expensive and larger Digital SLR camera along with lens.  For example Canon has a 800mm lens to fit the more the expensive cameras but it is 18 inches long weights 10 pounds and costs $13,499.00.The Superior Auto Mode also met my expectations.  It does not improve all photos but it does make astonishing improvements in photos that would benefit from this mode such as back light etc.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Closer and closer ... Almost there.., most people will love it", "Author": "Careful shopper", "ReviewID": "R3T3Q5VE22HN8F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sony DSC-HX200V is SO close to my vision of a great bridge camera.  Many good things about this camera, why they couldn't go a bit farther I don't know....Very small sensor is biggest item holding it back in my opinion, not so good to go with this many MP with sensor size of only 1/2.3\"Sensor measurements are;  Diagonal 7.66mm / 6.17mm Wide x 4.55mm High / Area 28.50 mm Sq / Crop Factor 5.6418 MP should allow you to crop a photo as much as you want to... but you pick up on the \"oil painting\" look very quickly if you crop in on a photo much at all....  of course many/most people will never do more than just print the photos right from the camera without changes in post processing.  Those people will be very pleased with this camera, those wanting to work with the photos a bit will not like the limits it presents.Pretty nice 27-810mm optical zoom range, there no need to use digital zoom.  As with any camera, more zoom lowers quality of photo, but for this type camera, it does pretty well.  Light and setting dependent of course.In case you wonder about the Carl Zeiss brand lens used, it is made by Sony using Carl Zeiss specs and is not actually ground and polished by Zeiss.As Sony states it;\"Every lens in a Sony product that carries the Carl Zeiss name is designed and produced in close collaboration between the two companies. Manufacture of a new lens is carried out by Sony, closely following stringent quality and testing guidelines defined by Carl Zeiss\".Note that you are NOT going to get DSLR quality photos unless you are using a lens that costs at least as much as this complete camera.  You just can't have the best optics with this type setup.  For most, this one is a good compromise all around.You also need a camera with larger, better featured sensor to get more quality... you just can't have it all at a lower price point but photo quality will please most people who have not had better camera/lens equipment.3\" LCD is bright and sharp with 921,000 pixels.  Can be seen outdoors in brighter light where others can'tI so wanted a bridge camera with articulated LCD as it can be so handy most times...  The DSC-HX200V does have one, however it only tilts in the horizontal plane and not side to side.  Such a shame they didn't do a full movement screen.  You CAN use it side to side if you are taking a portrait format shot with the camera held on end of course.... but really needed full movement like some of the competition.It also has an EVF (Electronic View Finder) that has an approximately 201,000 pixels.I hate to say that it seems to fall short in use... too small and not enough resolution.  It has diopter adjustment with notched stops to accommodate varying eyesight.  I found that I could not get a setting for my eye I'm sorry to say.  Going to be pretty useless for me I'm afraid.  Too bad also as it can save on battery over the large LCD screen.  Perhaps it will work better with your eye.If you've used a bridge camera or DSLR (or even a good P&S;) you will know how to use the controls and menus pretty quickly.  It has some new and unique features but getting to them is the same as most digital cameras.Love the fact that you can use the ring on the lens (electronic not mechanical) to focus or zoom depending on how you set it up in the menu.  Default zoom is a lever around the shutter button.Video is saved in AVCHD format (1920 x 1080 60p, 28M quality), (1920 x 1080 60i, 24M quality), (1920 x 1080 60i, 17M quality), (1440 x 1080 60i, 9M quality); MP4 format at 30 frames per second (1440 x 1080 12M), (1280 x 720 6M) or (640 x 480 3M). Audio format is AC3 stereo and clip length is 29 minutes at the highest quality AVCHD setting.  That is a pretty impressive video camera in itself I'd say.The DSC-HX200V outputs photo files at 350 dots per inch ready to print.  (many cameras output at 72-95 dpi more for monitor viewing and use in Emails)You'll need a high capacity, high speed memory card to go with this but the good news is that they are fast and affordable these days... get a class 10 speed no matter what capacity or brand you buy.For example;SanDisk Extreme HD Video 16 GB SDHC Class 10 Memory Card (SDSDRX3-016G-A21) , SanDisk Extreme 32GB 45MB/s SDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDX-032G-X46,Black, AmazonBasics SDHC Class 10 32 GB Secure Digital Card AmazonBasics SDHC Class 10 16 GB Secure Digital Card AmazonBasics SDHC Class 10 32 GB Secure Digital CardBattery  is charged IN the camera with supplied AC power adapter.  I will be getting an external charger as if the battery should fail while charging, I don't want to damage the camera as well.Brand New Sony Np-fh50, Fh30, Fh70, Fh100 Camera & Camcorder Battery Home Travel Rapid Charger with Car Adapter for Sony DCR-SR47 / DCR-SR47R / DCR-SR47LSony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V Battery Charger - Wall & Travel Charger for Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V several others available here at Amazon,Photos taken at lower ISO numbers are of course better than those taken at high ISO settings as with most any camera.  This Sony will try it's best to get you a decent photo in low light high ISO going as far as to take several shots and combine them into a better photo than if you had taken only one at one setting.Sure wish they would have threaded the lens so you could use protective UV filter and off the shelf lens hood. (and also had built the lens structure to handle the extra weight) I don't want to use an aftermarket push on hood or glass filter as the lens mechanics were not designed to hold more weight and adding more on the outer end when extended could make the barrel sag and distort photos over time.Plastic lens barrels can be a problem on their own many times.  Camera has all color filters selectable in the menu, would just be nice to have the protection of a filter over the lens.Some have expressed desire for it to be RAW capable.... but with a camera like this that has and promotes so many in-camera features for the user to improve their photos and fun, I don't think that would work so well.RAW would bypass all of them and require you to post process on your computer to have a finished photo.  RAW really needs a great lens and sensor ($) to give you the base UNcompressed file to work with, the point & shoot and bridge cameras need their onboard systems to please the owners with ready to view/print photos.No built in WiFi, But it is built to make use of an optional \"Eye-Fi\" card for transferring image data...You can set in menu whether to use the upload function of an Eye-Fi card (commercially available), when you use the Eye-Fi card with this camera.[Eye-Fi] is displayed only when the Eye-Fi card is inserted in the camera.MENU (Settings) (Main Settings) [Eye-Fi] desired modeHX200V also has the latest \"TransferJet\" function for wireless transfer of files to another TransferJet capable device.You can select TransferJet communication settings. MENU (Settings) (Main Settings) [TransferJet] desired mode (on/off)TransferJet is a close-up, wireless transfer technology that allows data to be transferred by closely aligning two products that you want to communicate with each other. To find out whether your camera is equipped with the TransferJet function, check for the TransferJet mark on the bottom of the camera.Using a Memory Stick with TransferJet (sold separately) allows images to be transferred between TransferJet-compatible devices.For more TransferJet info, see the Operating Instructions supplied with Memory Stick with TransferJet.Overall, this is a big step(s) forward for this type camera and only good things can come of this feature path in the future.  I only hope they can increase photo quality on the next version.As always I will update with anything I find worth mentioningUpdate;  Looks like Sony listened and uploaded the full .PDF manual to their web site now", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Lens", "Author": "Larry D.

They have, and are pioneering consumer Camera products that have other Camera manufactures scrambling to keep up. Here is some insight for the reader about the new Sony DSC-HX200V (released Feb. 28, 2012). I am an amateur hobby enthusiast photographer who primarily takes Wildlife and Landscape photos. Hence I am NOT an expert, but can at least hold a small candle in the photography world. This new DSC-HX200V system is a bit of a hybrid in that it is utilizing Sony's excellent Exmor Sensor, Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar \"T\" Lens system, offers an impressive array of MODE usages that are: Automatic, or User-controlled, or a combination of semi-auto & User-controlled functions and settings. With 18.2mp, and 30x Optical and another 30x Digital - you have the capabilities to expect very clear images taken at considerable distances. The host of features and options within this model are too extensive to burden the reader with herein - however in simple terms, this new Camera is a \"bad boy\" (very powerful) that provides nearly all the features of an expensive DSLR or SLT Alpha type Camera. It truly is a high end Point & Shoot Camera, and it has an Electronic Viewfinder (similar to Sony's Alpha series SLT Cameras).There are a couple things that prevent me from giving this rating a (5). Sony has discontinued providing its very good and respected Software Program known as \"PMB\" (Picture Movie Browser) that has in the past come with its products in the form of an included Disc to load into your computer system. This has now been replaced with Sony's \"PMH\" (Photo Memories Home) Software Program in which the Camera itself has built in Firmware (no diskette is included anymore) that will connect you on-line with Sony's Web, and download this new program into your computer system. The downloading will automatically erase any PMB Software with this new PMH product. In my case the erasure of PMB also stopped and took out Microsoft's \"Media Center\" program built into Windows 7 (I also use for Slide Shows), and this supposed newer/better software is anything but! The Camera does come with a rather poor 30pg. \"Users Manual\", and is also down loadable in PDF Format.Secondly, Sony's \"USERS GUIDE\" (some 215pg. detailed camera usage & operation) can only be seen by going to Sony's Web site via your Browser, and is in HTML format only. Meaning that you can not \"download\" the Users Guide into your system, NO PDF Formatting, you can only view one topic at a time, but you can print each topics 1-3 pages of HTML sub-section. SONY Support is absolutely terrible. It comes out of the Philippines in which they have little desire or understanding in truly helping you. They all have pre-written scripts of reply, and simply press a key for the script that \"might\" come close to your question or concern. This also holds true for their Level II Support, and \"Customer Relations\" Department. It is in poor marketing and support that Sony has ceased providing a Diskette that you can load into your PC enabling you to have \"at hand\" the necessary detailed operational usage, and functionality of your new purchase. Sony also does not offer a printed hard copy of the Users Guide, or Diskette for purchase either.  This is not the only product Sony sells that excludes user/owner operational product details. Sony has made dramatic cutbacks in many areas - as are so many other companies that are now shaving services, and product package contents - a real shame!This review reflects Cameta Camera (of Long Island, N.Y.) in which I have personally done business with them numerous times. They have outstanding pricing and carry top shelf brands of products. Their Customer Service department leaves much to be desired however - they do so much business that they are quite hard-nosed about things.The Camera product herein - is the follow-on to Sony's family of \"HX Series\" products. The HX9V for example came out in 2011 and is a terrific product. The HX 10, 20, 30 have also come out more recently. This HX200V (the \"V\" means it has GPS Capabilities to relate to exactly where/when the photograph was actually taken) shares much of the same features and functions as its bigger much more expensive Alpha Series SLT (DSLR type) Cameras. So the bottom line is: Sony has terrific products - truly - but their Support leaves a tremendous void. Sony Cameras are not only equal to, but surpass many of the other very well respected name brands - I know because I utilize DSLR & P&S; type products from Canon and Nikon also.I hope this provides some insight to the perspective buyer.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "otto0713", "ReviewID": "R36WKZQJM6KYM8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After looking for a decent bridge camera that would do the job, I finally settled on this one.

The new 18.2 MP. and the EXMOR R CMOS sensor are more than enough for even the advanced shooter who is looking to find both the scenic majesty of a wide-angle lens combined with the excellent 30X zoom and new advanced crystal clear X2 modifier capabilities. It leaves me astonished at the possibilities. This small package 1.2 lb. is a treasure, both to hold and shoot.I was swayed between this gem and the Nikon P510,Nikon COOLPIX P510 16.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 42x Zoom NIKKOR ED Glass Lens and GPS Record Location (Black) which has a 42X zoom, but has difficulty at long range focusing. Other complaints with the Nikon were the inherent noise heard in the video when zooming. I also scoped out the Panasonic FX 150 that sports a myriad of extras (including RAW files).Panasonic DMC-FZ150K 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom (Black) I couldn't find any negatives with the Panasonic and would highly recommend it if you don't like Sony; for whatever reason.I must add that this Sony is a real treasure, with a new ergo dynamic contour and masterfully executed menu lay-out, this thing is a pleasure to both shoot and also play with; the new added (up from the HX 100) special features, give you, the user, a great creative opportunity to shine. I would like to tell you that the accompanying shoulder strap is thin and I don't use it. I opted for a Bower leather wrist strap (from B&H; Photo@$6.95) that attaches to the tripod socket and is mandatory insurance for a potential camera drop; that not only would devastate you, but the camera also... Once you hold this thing, you will agree that a wrist strap is the way to go.Add to that a new Lowepro Edit 110 camera case,Lowepro Edit 110 Camcorder and Camera Bag and not only is the camera well protected, the added storage pockets easily provide that needed extra room for batteries and memory cards.I'm very impressed with this system and can't wait to get out there and capture those far-off shots that for years have evaded me.Finally, if you have read to here, I would like to emphasize the absolute necessity of using the wrist strap. I've heard so many horror stories of people grabbing their cameras without first putting on the wrist strap AND DROPPING THEM! I can't say enough about this.By and large, this camera will astonish you and may be the last one you will ever need. I highly recommend this one.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Camera Ever", "Author": "MRacingBrat20", "ReviewID": "RXQXX28AXCMPY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best camera everMy husband and I love to travel, we were about to go on vacation and wanted to purchase a new camera.  We bought a Sony Cyber Shot DSC - HX200V, and from the minute that we pulled it out of the box we were amazed!  The features of the camera are easily accessible and user friendly for even those that are not professional photographers.Before our recent purchase we owned a Canon Power Shot S2 IS which gave us the opportunity to know some functions and features that we wanted to look for in our new camera.  With this knowledge we were able to choose a camera that best fit our photography capabilities.For my husband and me one of the most important features of a camera is the zoom.  Since we are always taking far away shots we wanted a camera with good zoom.  Our old Cannon camera had a zoom of 12X optical but this new Sony has a zoom of 30X optical and up to 60X clear image.Secondly, we wanted to make sure that it had a larger LCD screen then our previous camera.  The Sony has a 3.0\" LCD compared to the Cannon's 1.8\" LCD.  One thing that I still preferred better on the cannon was that you can rotate the screen so you can close it into the camera to protect it.The third feature we were looking for was the processing speed of the camera.  With a regular point and shoot camera we were missing shots because it took so long to process each picture.  The Sony seams to take no time processing each picture unless you are taking multiple shots per second.The fourth feature that we looked for was the battery life of a camera.  Our old camera used 4 rechargeable AA batteries which did not hold a charge for very long.  The Sony camera has a regular photo battery which lasts a lot longer and takes more photos per charge.  This battery also rapid charges so you have less down time without your camera.Our last item to search for was the different functions of each camera.  Cameras have a lot of the same basic settings, but when you get into the fine details of each camera that is where you get your endless options.  Features on this camera, Sony Cyber Shot, are easy to access and use.  Everything is on screen and there are no special tricks to find all the options. Previously, with our old Cannon, the salesman showed us some of the really cool features but once we left the store we were never able to find them again.For us we found these functions to be the most useful:* Smile detection; it will automatically take our picture once it detects a smile on your face without pressing any buttons.* Color distortion; the camera will take a picture in black and white while only pulling one color.  (You can choose between yellow, red, blue or green.)* Continuous shooting; this setting allows you to choose from two options. The first option is 2 shots per second using up to ten shots.  The second option is 10 shots per second up to ten pictures.  This allows you to capture the \"perfect shot\" when your object is in motion.* Manual zoom; this feature is nice because if you have something that needs just that fine bit of clarification you can obtain it through the lens zoom.Some of the other settings that we liked were two auto settings, 3D still images, HD videos, and panoramic photos.  We really are very happy with our camera and do not regret the choice of purchasing it.  We would definitely recommend this camera to anyone that is looking for this type of camera.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "What else could I ask for?", "Author": "D. Ehlers \"D. E.\"", "ReviewID": "R2T52ZWO106I4Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a photographer for 15 years.  I helped my ex wife run her photography business for 5 years, serving as the post processor for 100,000's of Raw files, and was also the second shooter for weddings and celebrity events.  The last \"real\" camera that I spent a lot of time with was a Nikon D3, but have also owned a D2X and a 1D MKIII.  My ex wife retained all the good camera gear after our divorce, so I have been running around with a Nikon P7000 for the past 1.5 years.  Why the P7000?  Answer: full external manual controls.  It took decent snap shots when I needed to take pictures of people (or EBay items... lol).  I finally decided to try and photograph my kids baseball games....  and that camera just did not have ANY speed to do that.  I basically had to setthe camera to shutter priority mode at 1/500 and just time the shot right to capture action.... plus the whopping 1.2 fps was just not intended for sports.  TIME TO CAMERA SHOP.  I spent 3 days reading reviews of the latest super zooms on dpreview, cnet, zdnet, photography blog, imaging recource, etc.  It seemed like the Panasonic FZ150 and Sony HX100V, HX200V were the answer (because I also wanted 1080 60P video capability).  NOT ONE FREAKIN BIG BOX RETAILER, CAMERA STORE, OR OFFICE SUPPLY STORE EVEN STOCKED THE PANASONIC FZ150 in San Diego.  Seriously, who is in charge of ordering merchandise for these stores!!!!  So after going to EVERY store, I handled Canon and Nikon cameras in this category, and they just felt cheap and plasticy.  I handled a Panasonic FZ47, and it felt CHEAP, and if the FZ150 feels anything like it, there is no way I would drop $500 on that camera..  I came across a HX200V for $399, bought it.  I bought a 32GB SD card (class 10, 30mb/s) and photographed 2 little league games yesterday.  The \"Tracking Focus\" function is just awesome.  Simply press the center control button on the back of of the camera and a little box appears, now place that little box on your subject and press the center control button again......  now a larger \"floating\" box stays on your subject no matter where in the frame the subject moves to.  I was using shutter priority at 1/640 and shooting continuous bursts up to 10 frames all day long......  at the 10 fps setting.  This camera is FAST and free of delays, except when the camera needs to dump 10 full resolution images onto the memory card...  seemed to take about 3-4 seconds.  I filmed each of my son's batting sequences, twice each at 1080 60p.....  watched the video on my new Acer A510 tablet computer, and the video was well focused and smooth.  It's so funny, I don't think any of my action sequences were out of focus.  I have not had time to test all the other aspects of this camera, but so far, so good.  The build quality feels robust in my hands.  However, when the lense is fully retracted, if you shake the camera a little, you can feel play/movement of the lenses barrel inside the body.  I researched this, and the HX100V and a few other makes exhibit the same thing.  They are designed this way so that the seals are not too tight for the lense to zoom in and out smoothly, without resistance.  Once you zoom a bit toward the telephoto end, that play/movement tightens up and completely goes away.  Also, the up and down tilting real screen helped big time while holding the camera over my head to take pics over the fence.  Also, a big plus for me....  just leave the huge charging block/cable in the box....... this camera will also charge through the USB port with the other supplied cable, I charged it in my car by plugging in the USB cable into my cigarette lighter adapter iPod charger piece.  Someone in another review claimed that it does not come with a lense cap...... well it most certainly DOES.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "I like this camera", "Author": "Howard W.", "ReviewID": "R1A9LEPMPLYGYD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a part time professional photographer.  When I go on vacation, I don't want to carry all my expensive and heavy equipment.  I was looking for something that will allow me to get good vacations shots and not have to worry that there will be a problem with the pictures or the camera.I got this Sony for just that reason and I have put it through the paces to see how it performs.In general I would say it does a fine job.  Pictures are clear and useable for prints and Facebook and the same goes for the videos.I always turn off any digital or software zoom on the camera.  I figure Photoshop and Lightroom can do a better job than the camera's firmware.  With that said, the 30x zoom performs very well.One of the tests I did was to take some pictures of license plates of cars more than 100 feet away with the 30x zoom.  Not only was the license plate numbers clear, I could read the numbers (easily) on the registration stickers.  So while it wasn't as sharp and my expensive lens might have shot, for this kind of camera, I was pretty pleased.The videos were nice and clear and I could not detect and sound from the lens when zooming during the video.  Focus stayed locked on until I had zoomed to 30x on something only a foot away.  But I wouldn't expect to actually have worked.The thing I personally like the most is the live histogram.  You get this by turning on more information as a display option.  I think it actually works better as a light meter indicating what range of values you would get if you shoot the picture. Most cameras will give you a histogram of the shot after you take the photo.This camera has another interesting feature.  Both a view finder and a rear display.  It also senses when you are using the finder and turns off the display as to not draw your focus from the view finder.  This is a nice feature.There are a few things I don't like.  The camera \"feels\" cheap.  It is made of plastic and just feels like it will break if you drop it.  The automatic settings seem to choose high ISO values even in bright light. And one thing this camera doesn't do well is control the amount of noise in high ISO pictures.  However, there is a setting on the camera to reduce noise after taking the shot, but this adds about 2-3 seconds to each picture and unless you are in multi-picture mode, the camera is as slow as most point and shoot cameras.  I also wish there was a raw mode.There are a bazillion photo effects, but I never use any.  If I want to do that, I do it outside the camera.Though auto works okay, I would suggest shooting in P or M mode with the live histogram.  But no matter what mode you shoot in, you can take some very nice pictures and video with this camera.  Just don't drop it.", "Date": "June 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Versatile, easy to use, everyone in the household loves it", "Author": "M. Cordoba \"mxc\"", "ReviewID": "R3EW9EZL3DHCZQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About me: photography enthusiast. I own a DSLR with several lenses, know my way around shutter speed, iso, white balance, aperture, etc) I've also owned several point and shoot cameras over the years since they are easier to carry around (and I'm less worried they will break/get lost).About the camera:It's hard to find faults with this camera. The only potential issue is that at around $500 its touching the price point of entry level DSLRs. However, you would need to spend another $500 in lenses to cover the zoom range in this camera, and the complexities (weight, equipment, changing lenses) that come with it.This camera has everything, video, decent wide angle (but not great) but great zoom. The shutter speed is very quick. Obviously not as quick as a DSLR, but much quicker than any other point and click camera I've ever used.One really outstanding feature is the super panoramic shots you can capture with incredible ease. Set it to panorama, (easy twist of a knob) click shutter, (instructions show up on screen) and just gently move your camera sideways. It takes around 2 seconds and you can capture some amazing shots with it. I have used many cameras, and the ease and quality of this feature is second to none.Also a good thing, you can use standard SDHC cards. (yeah, Sony finally giving up on their silly desire for their own proprietary memory stick)Other pros:- GPS (auto geo-tagged pictures)- optical image stabilization- Did I mention is has a whopping 30x optical zoom? You can really get nice closeups. For those that don't care about image quality loss, it can be combined with a very decent digital zoom to get ridiculously close shots of very far away subjects.- you can zoom manually (with your hand on the zoom lens) or with the press of the button.- Manual focus option! This is great, we were trying to photograph a great looking lizard that was just below some leafs/low bushes, and the auto focus always focused on the leafs above the lizard, making it blurry. Well, you can very easily switch to manual and just twist it slightly to change the focus to your desired subject.Neutral (but worth pointing out)- 3D still image (gimmick in my opinion. Obviously you need a 3D tv to see them)- Compass- 18 mega pixels (sounds nice, but the sensor isn't any bigger/better. So image quality at 100% size is lower than those of a 10 mp camera with a similar sensor. Still, its a lot of megapixels and if you're only printing 10x8 or smaller sized photos, this is more than enough with great quality at those sizes. As always, megapixels isn't everything.Cons:- No RAW output (I considered taking off 1 star for this, but given this is a point and shoot at it's core I didn't feel it warranted it)On to other great things - the auto setting is really good. It tends to overcompensate too much for my taste. For example, you are in a slightly dark room, and you like that darkish setting for the picture. You snap the shot, and then stare at picture you've just taken - a lot (if not all) the time they will come out as if you've shot them in a bright light. Whites come out of nowhere to make the image clear. I was surprised to the length sony went to make all pictures look bright and white. The reason why I think this is a positive, is that's what most users typically want, a clear picture. If this was a DSLR I'd be pointing this as a negative feature, but for a point and shoot that you can give to a stranger, or kid to take a picture, this gives you a better success rate. (There are many manual options present if you want to control the image outcome)The colors are a bit over saturated, but that is also a common thing among point and shoot cameras, Since most people like the colors to jump out. (blues are bluer, reds-redder, green greener, etc).Overall, this is an incredibly versatile camera, with a lot of high end features, that make it overall, a good value, despite its higher than average price. If you want a camera that is easy to use, has high end features, and you don't want any extra lenses, this is probably the one to get.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera for the money", "Author": "amateur-pro", "ReviewID": "R21K5PO0WU7SZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera to upgrade from my very little point and shoot.

I like that I can carry the camera in an average camera bag and take it with me wherever I go because I like to have my camera with me all the time for the kids activities and wildlife I may run into.The zoom is more than adequate, in fact the zoom on this camera outdid a typical SLR camera on a recent photo shoot. The digital zoom has a stability feature so the pictures are crystal clear without the use of a tripod. I took photo's of the night moon and the zoom was so incredible using the low light feature that the mountains on the moon are clearly visible. Very impressive! The 18mp quality allows for crop and blow up to be even more amazing.I like the panaramic feature and the continuous shot mode, just by holding the button you get your consecutive pictures.I am only just learning all the features this camera has to offer but the camera has performed beyond what I expected so far.

I've used this camera while on a cruise vacation, at a 5-year old and 7-year old's soccer games, for landscape photos in my large backyard, family photos for my family of five, photos of my dog, photos of kids tubing, boating, swimming, and photos at different times through the day at different sunlight.  i think knowing your camera and reading the manual makes a HUGE difference.  It was a new toy for me, so i took the time to take test shots using my family and the surroundings while reading the manual on how to get that best shot! I previously have owned the Fuji Fine-pix, the cannon powershot, the Nikon cool pix and the Sony was by far the easiest to use and best photos I've taken!  I almost bought a DSLR camera...trying to decide between cannon and Nikon, but decided I have enough stuff to carry around with me and I didn't want to haul a mini backpack around.  Also,i didn't want to change lenses for different photo shots...not enough time for that, 3 kids doing 3 different things while on vacation, at the beach, or camping.  If you want an easy to use camera that can capture kids running for a soccer ball, a dog that doesn't sit still, the beautiful true blue water while out in the boat, a close up detailed photo of a birds nest up in a tree, the scenery out on vacation that makes you want to go back, and that perfect quick snapshot, then buy this Sony camera!

I have a great Canon DSLR and a small point and shoot, but I needed a good mix of the two. This camera isn't exactly what you'd call a bridge camera. It does have bridge camera functions, but it lacks the ability to shoot in RAW format. It also lacks a mic input, but the stereo mics on top of the camera do a more than passable job. The camera starts quick, from the moment you turn it on. The on/off button is sensitive, and doesn't require a deep press. There is little to no shutter lag, even in low light without the flash. The movie recorder is equally fast with very little lag. When talking about the movie mode, I would be remiss if I didn't expand on how spectacular the video quality is. I tried a few other super zoom cameras before finally settling on this one, and the movies on this one far exceed the ones from both the Nikon P510 and the Canon SX40 HS. Very good picture quality. The low light pics are very good, and don't get too noisy at higher ISO. The zoom is fantastic, and is quick to focus. It does have a slight hum to it, and can be detected when using the movie recorder. Sweep panorama is my favorite feature on this camera. The Canon requires post processing to get panoramas, and Fujis and Panasonics require that you stay within predefined parameters (sweep inside the dots on the screen). If you have the slightest bit of handshake, your panoramas will look like a puzzle with other cameras, but not with the Sony. It provides a near flawless panorama every time. The scene options are great and the in camera features are fantastic. The lens cap needs a sensor, as the camera will turn on and push out the lens regardless of the lens cap being in place.

to get damaged during our travels, so I helped her search for a camera that would deliver great picture results, good zoom, had a good amount of settings (simple and some manual control) and of course didn't cost too much.During our search, this camera popped up many times and ended up ticking all the boxes, that combined with the such high positive ratio on reviews, it ended up being a no-brainer, so we chose it.What comes in the box:The one and only... HX200V Camera! | Lens Cap | Power Adapter | USB - Micro USB Cable | Shoulder Strap | Battery | Manuals etc...Extras you will NEED:SanDisk Extreme 16GB SDHC Class 10 (You can buy a different brand/capacity if you want).Optional Extras:Sony LCS-U20 Carry Case for Handycam and Cameras, this is a brilliant case that keeps the HX200V well protected and has a good amount of pockets also.Upon taking the camera out of it's box, we instantly had a good impression just by holding it, it's super light, comfortable and has very nice grip.Before you start playing with the camera, I would highly recommend charging the battery up fully which takes approximately 100 minutes (1hr 40min).This camera has some nice simple settings for those who just want to point and shoot: 'Superior Auto' & 'Intelligent Auto', and if they happen to fail you, you can choose from many different pre-sets in the \"SCN\" mode(Scene Selection'), or choose the 'iSweep Panorama' to get those great panoramic shots easily.For those who aren't familiar with the more advanced photography settings and you want to get a good picture, stick with those mentioned above and leave the 'P'(Program Auto), 'S'(Shutter Speed Priority Shooting), 'A'(Aperture Priority Shooting), 'M'(Manual Exposure Shooting) and 'MR'(Memory recall mode) settings until you have time to play around and have fun with them.My sister had about a week to play around with this camera just before we went on holiday, she seemed to be able to navigate around the menu quite easily after a few tries.As for the experience with the camera, it's been mostly positive, the zoom is just fantastic, we both love the moveable/tilt LCD screen(probably one of the best features a camera could have).Like any camera, we did get a few out of focus photos, but the majority, be it using the full zoom, or even at low light(recommend using the ISO or hand-held twilight mode in low lighting conditions), have been superb.Overall, this is a great quality camera with superior zoom and photo taking capabilities, it's helped my sister take some fantastic shots whilst on holiday, so she's extremely happy.I have also included a video to show off the zoom and video quality (video uploaded was in the 1080p format, however I'm not sure what the quality outcome will be on Amazon).Anyway, from both me and my sister, we highly recommend this camera!", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this camera!", "Author": "D. Schlicht", "ReviewID": "RDF74WH8ZEFEA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Canon PowerShot SX20 hs and was actually going to upgrade to the SX40, but after doing some research and going to the store and comparing cameras, I chose this the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V.  I know little about photography and cameras, but I know what I like.  This is a very smart camera.  It automatically chooses settings for the picture conditions.  This is different from the Canon as I had to decide the setting for the picture I was taking, and with the Canon I would get a lot of blur if I moved and on action shots even when I had the setting in action mode.  Not so with this camera.  And the zoom is fantastic and maintains great picture quality. Shooting video is easy and comes out unbelievably beautiful.  I think that's what really swung me on it.  For someone who's not technical and doesn't want to have to know much, but wants great photos and video, this camera is a no-brainer.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fast fun super zoom with disappointing omissions.", "Author": "Tony Hall \"If the movie stinks, just don't go!\"", "ReviewID": "R34XX5CJ4GKICY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm enjoying this camera for it's insane optical zoom coverage and incredible speed. It's easy to use, has some fun features and feels great in hand. My NEX-5N feels like a pocket camera after getting used to holding this thing. I'm a very experienced photography/camera geek, so I don't fool around with manuals and I don't need them. Did not miss the printed manual. Just spend an hour with your camera and see what all the options are.The Good:- Huge zoom range in a cheap, small, and light package.- LIGHTNING FAST focusing. Really makes my 5N feel kind of sluggish by comparison. And actually some DSLRs for that matter.- Huge grip. This thing feels so nice to hold.- Articulating LCD and thumb dial on the back. I love how you just click the thumb dial to switch between ISO, aperture and shutter speed (or exposure compensation).- The viewfinder helps when shooting outdoors.- GPS is an awesome feature for a camera like this. Sony really understands the kind of people who will be using this camera.The Bad:- No way to disable noise reduction. At moderate ISOs, aggressive noise reduction destroys image sharpness. If you're spoiled by your DSLR and a sharp lens, you'll want to stick around base ISO with this camera (and even ISO 100 looses detail to noise reduction).- Along the same lines, no RAW. The previous issue would be forgivable if I had some way of still retaining all the data so that I may run my own noise reduction (or none at all). Why not, really?- No way to disable auto review. Every time you snap a shot, the screen goes black for a moment and then your last shot appears. You can interrupt this by pressing the shutter button half way. I'm not interested auto review since I can see what the shot is going to look like before I even take the picture. This means a half shutter press in between each photo for me. it often causes me to loose track of my subject. I can't remember the last camera I used that didn't allow you to disable auto review.- No focus lock by holding the shutter halfway between shots  I also can't remember using a camera that didn't have this feature. Pretty much every camera from the cheapest point and shoot to the most expensive camera with keep focus (and sometimes exposure) locked between shots as long as you keep the shutter pressed half way between shots. This is definitely an intentional omission. Why? I have no idea.- I can't even set my own white balance in video? Yup, if you want to shoot video with this camera, it's auto white balance or nothing. Which will mean the occaiosonal blue video that could have been easily prevented with a selection from the menu.- SLUGGISH image zoom in review mode. If you want to check your focus, it takes a while for the camera to zoom in on your picture or some strange reason. Not so on my NEX. On the 5N, I can just tap the screen to magnify the picture and check sharpness.The UGLY:- Image quality at about ISO 400 and above. Do not get this camera if you're looking for low light performance. That is not what it's for. This camera is for taking photos in broad daylight. This is a great camera for sight seeing and takng wide shots and panoramas of tourist attractions. It's a great camera to take on a hike or to the zoo. Zoom in and capture the shot, IN BROAD DAYLIGHT. My advice is to use this camera in the sunlight or with the flash unless you're noti concerned with image quality and sharpness or are just going to post your photos on Facebook of Instagram.- All the feature omissions for no other conceivable purpose than to torture enthusiasts. No raw, no disabling auto review, no focus lock, and no white balance in video.Conclusion:Do you ever use your cell phone to take pictures? This is WAY better than a cell phone and in some ways, better than any DSLR setup that YOU could afford. The image quality is about point and shoot level... Better than cell phone quality, but closer to that than DSLR quality.However, what this camera is all about is the lens. The image quality of your DSLR doesn't matter if you can't afford an 800mm lens. In many cases the HX200V can simply capture images that would take a multi-thousand dollar DSLR rig to capture. And when you've got your DSLR sitting there with it's stunning low light abilities and raw files, you're still limited by the reach of your lens. If you're at the zoo with a d7000 and kit lens, trying to get a photo of a far off animal, you're not going to have a very sharp and detailed picture once you crop it down to what you had in mind.It's in these cases that the HX200V is going to kill medium zooms on SLRs. Even with it's lack of RAW and destructive noise supression, it's optical ability to get into the subject is going to insure you have way more \"data\" of your subject than you would with a shorter lens.It should also be mentioned that this camera is obviously geared towards gadget freaks more than photographers. There are so many fun and gimmicky features like panorama, picture effects, and even 3D that it's obvious this camera is being marketed towards the iPad crowd.For what it is, it's a great camera. I think I'll have a lot of fun hiking with it and taking it to the zoo. It could never replace my 5N when it comes to image quality though and I do have to emphasize that the intentional handicapping of this camera by omitting enthusiast features is a disappointment. It does deserve at least four stars for what it does at this price.", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Package", "Author": "NauticalArt", "ReviewID": "RN0BFBFJ6W2OD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been very satisfied with Sony DSC digital cameras, and the DSC-HX200V is the forth Sony DSC I have owned. My previous Sony was the DSC-H5 which featured a 12X optical zoom which has always performed well in my research for nautical paintings. The DSC-HX200V has an amazing zoom and a myriad of complex features for a digital camera that is not an SLR. Make no mistake, this is a fine zoom camera. My comments on the camera pertain to what Sony has supplied in the packaging of this camera as to accessories and instruction. In my opinion, Sony should have included the following in the package for a camera of this price and complexity.1. This camera package does not include a lens hood or a means of attaching a lens hood. There is no inside or outside threaded area for attaching a lens hood or a filter. The Sony DSC-H5 came with a very nice  lens hood. I feel the lens is vulnerable to scratches, abrasions, and light refraction without a hood or filter. Sony does provide a lens cap.2. The camera comes with a battery, but no SD or SDHC memory card. Even a simple SD card would seem appropriate at this price to get one familiar with the camera.3. The battery for this camera is charged IN the camera. I feel Sony should provide an exterior charger for the convenience of charging several batteries prior to a trip. The Sony DSC-H5 came with a separate  battery charger.4. The instruction manual is woefully inadequate for a complex camera such as this. Sony should not assume that everyone can access the features of this camera using this manual. Sony does refer those having  computers to their site for more complete instruction.....however, not everyone ( believe it or not ) has a computer. I do have a Mac computer, but found the site somewhat perplexing. There is also an \" In-  Camera Guide \" which one can access, but I could not access specific questions I had on this guide. A thorough paper reference guide would be preferable. I tried to contact Sony to  make suggestions, but , was not able to find a suggestion contact. The included instruction manual also does not have an index. I strongly feel that Sony should provide a COMPLETE instruction DVD with this  camera, plus a COMPLETE instruction manual which is fully indexed. The Sony DSC-H5 had a \" Read This First\" startup guide and a separate indexed instruction manual that was far more complete than the  DSC-HX200V manual.  All this being said, I repeat that I have been very satisfied with Sony DSC cameras. They are fine cameras with fine Carl Zeiss lenses. On this particular camera, Sony should have put more thought into accessories and instruction, and not assume that the general public will understand this complex product and it's capabilities.", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best upgrade yet", "Author": "B. Heinemann \"BH\"", "ReviewID": "R1FLKVLZ4FM92X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third Sony camera. First had the Sony W100, then upgraded to the Sony DSC-HX5V. I was looking to upgrade again for the mega zoom features and still keep the GPS feature.My review of the Sony HX5V is here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GTX0QZ6PRHKB/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permOver the years I've owned digital cameras, smartphone cameras keep getting better and better. I was looking to upgrade my camera to get some good zoom functionality and one day had an epiphany when thinking about my digital camera use. I carry my phone with me everywhere. It's become my main camera. My actual digital camera sits at home in its bag and only comes out to play when I travel or take vacation. Once I realized that, I wasn't so concerned about getting a camera that was small or compact because a small, compact camera is what the iPhone has basically become.After looking at all the reviews and doing lots of comparisons at snapsort's site, I settled on the Sony DSC-HX200V. I wanted to keep the GPS feature, I liked the 30X zoom, and thought the HD video recording might come in handy. I liked that the interface was similar to the W100 and HX5V that I'd gotten used to.I'm not a prosumer, or even a camera pro. I'm a guy who wants to turn on the camera, select the auto button and get good photos. The Sony does that. I have taken this camera to Kauai and Maui several times since and it's been great. Battery life has been excellent, the GPS works great and the pictures have been fantastic. The zoom feature works excellent as well as the image stabilization. It took some getting used to carrying around a bigger camera but I'm happy and it's exceeded my expectations.LIKES:Camera has a strap/cord to attach lens cover to camera body so that it doesn't get lost. This is nice. You have to remember to remove lens cap, if you turn on the camera it will kinda pop off, probably not best for it.I didn't think I'd care about the tilt out lcd screen, but I've gotten to really like it a lot.My Sony HX5V LCD screen seemed to scratch easily and I had to get a screen protector for it, but the lcd on the HX200V seems more scratch resistant and haven't had any issues.GRIPES:Sony doesn't include a battery charger anymore. I like charging the battery separate and not in the camera. In fact all three Sonys I've had the cables pretty much stay in the box. I ordered the Sony BCTRV Travel Charger -Black and it fits fine in the camera bag.GPS locking can take a little while depending on your view of the sky. The HX5V would use your last coordinates but this camera seems to start fresh each time and not use the last coordinates. You can speed up the lock by updating the GPS assis file on the camera card. There is Windows software included but I'm a mac guy but if you google sony gpsassist-updater you'll find a nice little mac program that will handle the job. GPS coordinates aren't embedded in videos but you can paste location in iPhoto on Mac.Speaking of camera bags, best one I found via someone else's review is the Case Logic DCB-304 Compact System/Hybrid Camera Case (Black) It holds the camera, has side pockets for charger and cleaning cloths and has a shoulder strap. Works great, highly recommend.Mac & Software:I've seen a few reviews griping about software and mac. People listen, you fled the pc world because of crappy software. Most camera included software is for pc because they really don't have anything better. Mac comes with iPhoto. Learn it and love it. It's better than the crap included software and works fantastic. The pro folks have already moved beyond that to Aperture and and whatever Adobe is selling this week. I have used iPhoto with all three of my Sony cameras and it works great, even with the video files.  Other than the GPS assist function mentioned above, if you've got a mac, leave the sony software in the box.Video:I used the video mode this weekend for the first time. My brother had a part on stage at a program and I was way at the back of the auditorium (almost 4,000 people, big place) and I used the zoom feature to zoom in and record. I didn't have a tripod, so the camera rested on my knee and it was a little shaky, but recorded fine and I was even pleased with the audio quality. Loaded the video into iMovie on the mac and did the image stabilization and it turned out great.I noticed that Amazon is now showing that the Sony HX300B is replacing the HX200V. From what I can tell, it's bigger, heavier, shorter battery life and no GPS!!. My HX200V will be my camera for awhile, it's a keeper.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everything I Wanted and More!", "Author": "K. Tate", "ReviewID": "R24JHX7CPIRLPW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When my backpack was stolen in May in Barcelona, I found myself in the market for a new camera. My old camera was a Sony DSC-HX1, which with only minor flaws, we absolutely loved. I never liked the fact that Sony forced you to use their memory stick, and the picture quality was acceptable, but no where near that of a DSLR. So, when I started my replacement search, I was focused more on Canons, Nikons, and the new Sony Alpha series DSLR.  But because we had had such good luck with the Sony DSC-HX1, I decided to at least take a look at the new model, the DSC-HX200V.So, I did a ton of research, visited with several high-end camera shops in the Raleigh area, and spoke with a number of experienced photographers. All the research and the advice led me right back to the DSC-HX200V. My wife wants something that is simple to use and takes great pictures in \"auto\" mode. And the advice that one photographer gave me, pushed me over the top - he said, \"If you spend a lot of money on a Nikon d5100 and leave it in auto-mode, you have wasted a lot of money!\" And he was right. Almost any point-and-shoot, including the cameras built into most smartphones today, can take perfectly acceptable pictures in auto-mode. The real question is - what else do they have to offer. The answer to this question is where the Sony DSC-HX200V really shines!Like its predecessors, the camera has a built in panorama mode...just hold the shutter button down and pan left to right.  The internal processor stitches the images together into a perfect shot! Don't go looking for this on any other brand camera because Sony acquired the patent when the bought the 'Minds of Minolta'. It is truly amazing technology that allows for the capture of incredible shots.  To get these shots with a high end Nikon would require you do stitching in a 3rd party software on your computer like Photoshop.We liked the DSC-HX1, but its big brother has much more power and capabilities. This camera sports a 18 MP processor, and its picture quality rivals (not equals...and it never will) the DSLR. And in 'Scene' mode, they have added a few settings that I really love...like an HDR mode (three images combined to give you perfect light balance) and a \"background defocus\" mode, which produces DSLR-like images with shark subjects against a blurred background. And for the creative types that like Instagram, you will love the \"miniature\" mode, which somehow applies filters and light settings to make any picture appear as if it is a miniature model and not real. There is also a setting that will take a B&W; shot with one predominant color left in...something that it takes me hours to do in Photoshop in post production.Another really cool feature this camera has is that it automatically senses when you are putting it up to your face, so it switches from the LCD image to an image in the view finder. Sweet! Add to these features the fact that this camera now comes with a 30X optical zoom, allowing you to take shots of craters on the moon (no kidding), and it is one powerful beast. Oh, and Sony got the message about the overall dislike of the memory stick, so now you can also use a standard SD card in this camera!  Thanks Sony!All-in-all, this new Sony DSC-HX200v is absolutely everything we ever wanted and more! I give it a full five stars!BTW - warning to those traveling in Europe - take precautions not to fall victim to teams of crafty thieves! They will distract you, take your belongings and you will never ever know it. I suppose the silver lining in this experience for me, was being able to get this new camera!", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best bang for your buck", "Author": "Rachel Gravelle", "ReviewID": "R34VE5AMPV3SN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok-  I have waited about 6 weeks of having the camera to write a review that would be useful to potential purchasers.

Wow, what a difference in function, photo quality and ease of use the Sony is. Using the sony zoom compared to the nikon there were interesting differences. The sony photo image has clear image detail along with excellent color rendition compared to the nikon.  In fact, I had to take 6 photo's of the same image with the p510 to try to get a similar quality image as the sony and it still didn't show the fine detail and color the the sony did in the first try! (the nikon p510 going back). Just started using the hx200. But from the looks of the terrific image quality, ease of use for the menu navigation user interface, and overall quality features and options I will keeping this. I purchased the Case Logic DCB-304 High/Fixed Zoom Camera Case, which fits perfect and room for filters, small accessories and the shape of the case is easy to wear/use. This replaces a 4 year old panasonic smaller point and shoot.  The sony hx200 does some excellent low light images and very quick image capture and shoots 10 fps! Very happy with the hx200 and would highly recommend this camera.**UPDATE 12/20/12 just finished a 2 week vaca and took more than 1500 images along with over 90 min of video with the hx200. Performance was accurate, color rendition is very crisp and impressive from no zoom to super full zoom. Was able to capture whale splashing in the ocean in full zoom with crisp definition and droplets of water. I enjoyed learning some of the functions to improve various images. Including a function to add high 'vivid' colors to landscape photos. It would be difficult to take a bad image with the well designed hx200. Overall ease of use was simple and quick. I have small hands and this camera fits well for me. The one thing I had to get used to for this camera was the lens cap. I took the hx200 on long hikes, sailing, flying ect.  Low light performance is excellent! I took a little time to learn the functions and experiment to find what settings worked well for me. What a terrific camera and very happy to recommend the hx200.**another Update** 1/24/13 I wanted to note that I use this camera frequently on a daily basis. I purchased an additional battery but even after a day of 300 shots and 20 min of vid, I have not had to change my battery that came with the camera.  Also: for those that are saying it is slow. Not the case! Are you using a class 10 card?? The card you are using may be what is making your camera record slow!! I use a class 10 card and I get no lag for camera shots.

I wasn't concerned about the slightly longer zoom or the more megapixels but wanted something that would focus faster and have a shorter lag time between shots.  This camera has really amazed me!  The Z981 has an image stability process but this camera has a much, much better system so I can handhold long zoom shots and get a good picture.  The lens is incredibly sharp.  I have taken closeups of a lily's blossom from several feet away, handheld, and been able to see the texture in the petals.  I took a picture of a small airplane coming in for a landing, still at probably at least 1000 feet, and the camera exposed for the plane well against the sky and even froze the plane's propeller.  True, there are not great instructions for this camera but I have been able to learn the basic things I need to use the camera.  Between the printed instructions and the learning system inside the camera I know I will be able to master all the functions of the camera as I need them.  I had spent several days doing intense research in person at stores and over the internet and read dozens and dozens of user reviews on many different digital cameras of this type, \"bridge cameras.\"  This camera was very highly rated overall and seems to have no Achilles heel other than, perhaps, the lack of a good instruction book.  I wish someone, an outside source if necessary, would write an indepth guide to this camera.  This camera is phenomenal!  I am incredible pleased with it!", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Much Better Than All Other Superzoom Cameras", "Author": "Capt. Aero", "ReviewID": "R1C2J8DXMLBT9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used the Sony HX200V regularly for one year, after having the HX1 and HX100V before that. It has an almost errorless autofocus for both photos and videos, even in dim light. Once it grabs a moving subject in a video, it will stick tight on it, even when it passes behind tree limbs or other obstructions. For long-range wildlife, it is without equal.Although it comes with no means to attach a telextender, a KiwiFotos lens adaptor tube for it can be bought here on Amazon and it fits solidly, with good alignment. I use it frequently with 1.7X and 2.2X telex lenses, for even greater reach. The autofocus works just as dependably with these lenses. I usually shoot in the 16:9 mode, that uses 13.5 Megapixels of the sensor, for a widescreen picture. This mode gets more bits-per-pixel for J-PEG encoding and this can improve the quality of the photos, especially if you show them at larger sizes. I usually reduce the size for Internet viewing down to about 1,600 X 900, with the Sony Play Memories Home Program. I set the quality at the highest level of 6 and the results are excellent.There is one problem that has surfaced about the noise-reduction settings. When it is set in the Menu to the minus position, it actually raises the noise-reduction function to the same as the high position, which can degrade the photo quality. Sony doesn't seem to issue firmware upgrades to resolve such issues, so it is best to set the noise-reduction to the middle position, which causes no loss of quality that I can see. I have also set my Contrast, Sharpness and Color-Saturation functions in the Menu to the high positions and I get a richer and better image. I most often shoot in the P mode and lock the ISO at the lowest position of 100, moving this setting upward only when dimming light or indoor shooting requires it. The lower the ISO level the better, for picture quality, as long as there's enough light to support a low setting. These small-sensored, long-zoom cameras can't have the ISO raised very much, the way it is done with large-sensored D-SLRs. If you leave the ISO on auto mode without locking it, the camera may jump up the level too high. The photos and videos often require the EV setting on the control wheel to be lowered one click or sometimes two.In the video settings, you can choose between several modes, with different encoding levels and frame-rates. I always use the PS mode, which has 60p scanning, in the AVCHD format. By using 60p, all of the artifacts caused by the CMOS sensor when panning or shooting fast-moving subjects, are eliminated. If you use any of the 60i or 30p scanning modes, there will be juddering (stuttering) of moving subjects. It's also necessary to have a moderately-fast computer to play the 60p video smoothly and I find that the Sony PMH Program does a good job in playback.I should mention that I recently bought a new Sony HX300 camera, that has a 21.5-MP sensor and a 50X zoom lens. After five days of testing, I determined that it does not come up to the performance of the HX200V. It doesn't focus as well at full zoom or in lower light levels and doesn't dependably keep its focus on more difficult subjects. Both its photos and videos are not as sharp and I have returned it to the dealer. I will now have a renewed appreciation for my HX200V and I may buy another one as a spare, at the reduced closeout price. There may not be another long-zoom camera such as this, in coming years.Update on 5/11/14: In fact, after writing this review, I did buy another HX200V camera. It has an updated firmware, to V 1.01. The fault I mentioned above about the noise-reduction in the minus position, has been corrected. Sony made no announcement about this update and does not furnish it to those who bought the earlier HX200V cameras with the v 1.00 firmware. I recommend reading my review of the new 2014 model, the HX400V, which performs very well.Steve McDonald", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Far Exceeded My Expectaions", "Author": "Darren M. Tooley", "ReviewID": "R3F8QC8TC3EQWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been reviewing super zoom camera's for the past 2 months. I had it narrowed down to the Canon SX50, Nikon P510 and the Sony DSC-HX200V. I consider myself an Intermediate/Life events photographer and for me the DSLR's were out of the question. I eneded up going with the Sony for the meriad of fetures that none of the other camers offered. 18.2MP is great, 30x zoom with the 60x clear digital zoom is phenominal. I've always wanted a camera that could zoom in to the moon and show great detail and the Sony does just that. Although the Canon SX50 has a greater zoom (50x) it is lacking with 12mp's. My favorite feature of the Sony is the \"defocused background\" that will take 2 shots, creating sharp focused detail on the object shooting and blurring out the background creating a beautiful portrait that was previously only possible with a professional DSLR. The Sony is very simple to operate with several \"auto modes\" that are great for the quick point and shoot for your everyday use. The Video produced is a Stunning 1080/60p which is Crisp and beautiful for playback. I Love the 3D Stills options and  Panorama. It takes phenominal Low light images with incredible clarity and detail without a flash. I would buy this camera again without hesitation. If there were any problems I could easily return it but Love the camera. The down side to this camera is the inability to delete photos from the Memory card with the computer. You have to do all of your photo/video management with the camera functions only. which isn't nice at all. In addition you have to charge your battery while it is in the phone, the is no external battery charger included. The instruction manual is poor to fair at best. Even with the online manual it does a poor job of specific details on how to use the many functions. they are pretty vague..for instance, if you want to use the \"defocused background\" all of the manuals will tell you what the function does but does not elaborate on how to actually get the function to work correctly. I select that option then aim the camera, half press the shutter button for the very fast auto focus and recognition, then full press of the button. 50% of the time it will take the picture beautifully, the other times it will say \"unable to perform specified function at this time\" and I have no idea why. I dont know if i am to close or to far away from the object and it does not explain it anywhere how to use this function properly. Overall though the camera is great, you wont find all these options in any other camer. it feels great.

It zooms very fast, too, usually within a couple of seconds, much much faster than the Nikon P510. I also like the long-lasting of the battery life; it can sustain almost 6 hours continuous shooting, making my backup battery almost useless except for the day in Louvre, Paris.

Having said that, I find this camera extraordinarily complicated relative to my Canon EOS DSLRs. There were buttons for things on the DSLRs that appear in this camera only in a drop-down menu. Why can't I just twirl a knob to change the ISO???The payoff seems to be in the end product. I find that every single photo that comes out of a DSLR needs editing. Not so with this camera.

On safari, we two couples took two Sony hx200v cameras and one entry level Nikon DSLR, as well as the newest high-end Nikon DSLR, both with Sigma zoom lenses.  The latter lenses weighed about 4 pounds and were difficult to maneuver, but the high-end Nikon pictures were superior to the Sony pictures (as should be expected when the equipment costs about 12 times as much).  The Sony cameras were very easy to use and produced excellent pictures, with greater magnification than the Nikon cameras were able to achieve without cropping. We considered purchasing the Canon SX40. However, the Sony has two very valuable attributes that no non-Sony camera has regardless of price.  First, it has what is known as the backlit option.  In taking pictures, sometimes part of the picture is in bright sunlight and the other part is in shade. If you adjust the camera settings for the bright light portion, then the part in shade is too dark, and if you adjust the camera settings for the dark portion, then the part in light is washed out.  And going halfway means that neither the shaded portion nor the sunny portion looks right. What the Sony camera does is take two pictures at once, one automatically adjusted for the light and the other adjusted for the shade. Then it combines both pictures into one, where both parts are more balanced. The light part is still lighter than the shaded part, but both parts work. And all this is done, without any complicated manual adjustments. The second attribute is that under the \"superior auto selection\", the Sony camera takes 3 pictures in very rapid succession. It then throws out the random noise to produce a superior picture.  Like the Canon Sx40 and almost all point and shoot cameras, the Sony hx200v has a very small sensor. This means that a lot of random noise enters the digital photo. By taking three pictures, the camera can eliminate most of the random noise as random noise is unlikely to affect the same pixels. This is a very easy to use camera that produces excellent pictures and very high-quality video. It also allows those who like to adjust camera settings in various ways to do so.

But during my London visit for Olympics, I dropped the camera from the table to the wooden floor, and the LCD monitor got shattered. It works through the viewfinder, but, everyone noticed me and felt uncomfortable being in my pictures. I probably appeared to pose too powerful to them, perhaps. So, I immediately ordered DSC-HX200V on Amazon.co.uk.1. The body is less covered with the rubbery texture, and the on/off switch is grey chrome finish instead of regular silver tone. With the older one, when I first took it out of the box, it was a shock, but, I instantly liked it as the rubbery texture allow me to grab the camera confidently, and, with HX200V, the embossed texture is thin and it is less characteristic, slight disappointment, but you won't even notice it.2.(+)The on/off switch responds slightly faster, and even if the monitor is not turned on yet, it still manage to take 1-2 pictures, not to miss the speedy moments.3.(-)The color in Super Auto (that golden setting) is not as saturated as the HX100V (other users post the pictures of a dog, that is about it). The older version carries a very rich nice color saturation in all situations.4.(+)The night picture is a definite stepup from the HX100V. Less blurry, or grainy, and less red color saturated. I have a very steady hand, and I no longer use flash light at night, but only in the beach during the day facing the sun.5.(+/-)iPanorama is a great picture to document the feel of the location, but, horizontally used,  it cuts out the top and the bottom of the regular frame. And the figures are recorded noticeably thinner that they are. But, somewhere like cathedrals, sometimes, the vertical panorama create an arch ceiling and the columns seamlessly, and I was impressed with the result. I often feel like a kid with a magic wand. I didn't do anything but the camera did all the job.6.(-)Macro is a step down. Sometimes, I use this feature to take pictures of insects, and I cannot get too close to them without startling them. HX100V would let me use a little of zoom feature with macro, but with this new HX200v, it takes 3-5 seconds before it automatically macro focuses if the zoom is used a little. So, this is the only time I should be patient with this camera.7. (-)For the video setting, I had used MP4 setting, and the new camera would not record the other format as the old memory card had created the specific setting folder. Video Recording is often better than the actual still pictures, true to the actual images, colors, and sound that you perceive. I use a lot of video clips to capture my trips. I love instant dual recording feature, however, the pictures taken during recording the video will not be as great as the super auto setting on its own. I would say, it is at best, the P mode picture, which is not bad at all for many users.8. (-) (lacking a wall charger) still today, you will have to buy a separate wall charger for the battery, as their adaptor is as big and tangled as the small laptop adaptor and I have never used it.9. (generic Battery?) If you think of buying a generic 1000 mAh battery, you will experience the flickering monitor when the power is down to 30% or less. You never experience this with the Sony's authentic battery(830mAh)and Sony battery lasts longer. I would only buy Sony battery at $30+.Now, after the summer is more than half way through, I see the price further dropped to $409, And, this is again a very affordable great camera that any casual user should own, without hesitation. But, my firsthand experience after 3 week events still tells me there was no surprising upgrade with this updated model compared to the last year's HX100V.However, this shouldn't sound like a complaint at all. I love them both ;) My pictures definitely tell the difference since I switched to Sony HX series last year.The only concern is that I need to buy ext HDD to store all the pictures I took and sort them out vigorously.

I am incredibly impressed with the functioning of the 10 zoom, but not with this 30 zoom. I returned the camera after four days of shooting in various settings on various subjects. The zoom does not render sharp images when wanting to crop an image in software, nor when magnifying the image while it is still in the camera to view afterward of taking it. Compared to the 10 zoom, which is amazingly sharp on both those aspects (cropping in software and magnifying in camera) the 30 simply lacks. My reason for purchase was to have the quality of the 10 zoom now in a 30. But, that quality isn't there. Also, when at full zoom, trying to get the camera to focus on an isolated subject, like a bird/butterfly or similar, doesn't happen - you have to back the zoom off sometimes up to halfway (15 zoom) for it to recognize the subject and focus accurately. Which defeated the purpose of wanting this camera. The 10 zoom can be used at full zoom and cropped with amazing sharpness, having me wish the 30 could do the same. If it could've performed in this same way then the 30 zoom would've been my prized point and shoot camera in my arsenal of cameras, but alas that's not the case. Now, if you want just an all around good point and shoot other than for acutely getting in on specific nature shots such as I do, then this camera would suit you. But, for the magnitude of what I sought, the camera was not for me. Last note, the viewfinder could also be better on the 30 zoom.

With that in mind, there are three things about the HX200V that would make this 6 stars, were they included.  Threads for filters, dedicated remote port and the ability to sync with an external flash, all of which were on the A1 and A2.  Those things would help make this more of a photographer's cam.  Plus, it was having bought the filters, remote and external flash for the A1 that helped me decide to get the Sony A200.  Still, I bought this for the features it does have like the ability to switch control of the zoom & focus from the lens to the body and the full manual mode.  Some say the boost to 18mp doesn't help and makes the pictures fuzzy, but the HX200 has many resolutions to choose from.  If you've been shooting at 10mp or less before now, I think you'll see that what we assumed was \"sharpness\" was a lack of detail.  Kind of like making the jump from VGA to even just 2mp.Newer pics on older displays don't quite match up.  As far as picture quality, I noticed the HX200 likes contrast. I'm impressed with what it can do with HDR in B&W.;  I like that there are links to the more obscure functions in the in-camera guide.

I like the viewfinder- it turns on when you put your eye to it.  Crisp, clear pictures.  Good battery life- mine isn't even fully charged right now and it displays 230 minutes of charge (recording movies obviously reduces that time).  It has this awesome feature where you can take 10 contiguous shots in less than two seconds.  That has been SO handy when snapping group photos.  You're bound to have one with everyone's eyes open!  To get to some of the neat picture options (b&W;, Toy camera, painting, miniature, etc), you have to set the dial to P.  The panorama picture was too cool!  It's come in handy a couple times.

Linstrom", "ReviewID": "R1YZFMRC2XAE78", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera, after considerable research, in order to take pictures of my son playing Little League baseball. The primary criteria included the ability to fill the frame with a batter from across a 200 foot baseball field, multiple frames/sec for action shots, and a reasonably high resolution for cropped enlargements. The secondary criteria included ability to take video for the random times I might want that.I've had the camera for almost a week and have taken upwards of 300 pictures, mostly on the baseball field. First off, this camera is not a dumbed down DSLR but rather a super point and shoot. The difference is important since it affects expectations of what can be done and how. The best example I have is multiple frame per second (MFPS) shooting. With a DSLR one either pushes the shutter release quickly or holds it down. That flexibility is not an option with this camera. To get MFPS with this camera, the proper mode has to be selected. Once selected, every time the shutter release is pushed a variable number of pictures are captured, from 2 to 10, depending on length of push and settings. Keeping this short and sweet, I was able to figure out the MFPS settings and am completely satisfied that it works well. While I end up taking more frames than needed, it costs nothing since the memory card holds over 5,000 frames at highest resolution.The photographic results are very good. The only frames that were out of focus were improperly shot; my fault. Image stabilization is fantastic. None of my frames exhibited camera movement, even at high zoom. The next thing I want to master is how to set the focal depth of field - currently everything is in focus on long shots (not a problem but shorter depths of field yield more interesting pictures IMO). I've poked around but haven't been able to figure it out yet, although I know it is there somewhere.Battery life seems pretty good. I shot those 300 frames over a two day period on a single charge, ending up with more than an hour battery life left.That's all the comes to mind for now.

I wanted to be able to be some distance away from them and still get great shots (for example - at swim lessons when they are on the other side of the pool).  Basically capture those moments when they aren't posing or noticing you are right there, but instead are completely enthralled in their activity and you can get that picture that shows the look of joy on their faces or the concentration they are putting into what they are doing.  Those pictures are hard to get when you have to be close with your average point and shoot.

Where it has issues is in low lighting or with some macro photography. The Fujifilm HS series does better at zooming in from a distance for a macro- level photograph from a couple feet away. The Kodak does better in low light. This shines over both of them when the lighting and distance are just right.For some images like if it's very far away or a macro photo of something small but moving just a bit like a bug, it will snap a few images very quickly then composite them into one image.

The rest were soft and fuzzy, even though the camera thought it had locked focus (solid green light and focus brackets). I tested all focal lengths from macro to fully extended zoom, in bright cloudy outdoor light and bright indoor natural light. Same results throughout: mushy focus that couldn't be seen until the photos were uploaded.There were two symptoms of malfunction as I was shooting. First, the camera shake warning flashed for every single shot. This is not reasonable: my hands are normally steady, and although at full zoom one might expect that a tripod would be necessary, it shouldn't be needed for macro or moderate focal lengths. Clearly the internal optical stabilization of the camera was malfunctioning. Second, the manual focus function of the zoom/focus ring didn't work at all. The ring would zoom when set to zoom/autofocus, but it simply would not focus when set to do so.One more thing to be concerned about with this camera: it does not accept a filter or lens hood. In other words, there's no way to protect its precious lens from scratches, impact, or rain. I confirmed this with Sony.Finally, the low-resolution viewfinder of this camera offers barely adequate clarity for framing and focusing pictures.I've sent the camera back for a refund, and I'm disappointed.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Problems with focus, not an easy-to-use camera", "Author": "OlyNomad", "ReviewID": "R22B2S2R7ACVQA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have a nature photo blog and have used various Sony cameras for almost 10 years and was very excited to get this camera, but I had to return it because it would not focus. I have since read many complaints about this, so no it wasn't just a defective unit unless there are many defective units out there with the same focus failure.  It appears to be an issue with this model. I went to the pond and couldn't even get it to focus in on a duck or a crane, it was just a blur.  Same with the mountains, same with my dogs.  None of my shots turned out.  That is the main thing a camera needs to do and it failed.  It doesn't matter if I can zoom in on something if I can't get a decent shot of it.There were other reasons to not like this camera:- The lens cap is awkward and each time I'd go to take it off it would annoy me.- Does not come with a full user manual, just a small paper one that lacked detail.  With a camera like this, I expect a quality manual.  I do not want to have to go look it up online or get a pdf of it.  I want something I can carry with me and make quick references.- Does not come with a battery charger, you plug the camera in to charge it.- It had loads of features but they weren't easy or quick to access.  If you are like me and just want a camera you can pick up and get the shot quickly, this isn't it. There is a delay after each shot.  If you switch it to a scene mode, that screen stays on for several seconds before it allows you to take the shot.  It's like they packed it full of features at the expense of function.

I will admit, I was honestly stuck. Should I get the lumix fz200 or the hx200v? I must have read every review on the computer....twice. Ultimately it really does depend on 2 things. Who you are, and what you are going to do with it! If you are a professional photographer with the need for RAW files and Hot shoe - this is not a camera for you! HOWEVER, for the average Joe who wants to take family photos or movies this is more than enough camera to get the job done! Personally, I guess I'm stuck somewhere in the middle. I work on eBay and sell vintage items, jewelry, etc. so I had to have the ability to take great macro shots. In my spare time, I love to shoot close-ups of insects...(there really are aliens in the backyard you know!). I have had a bit over a week to play with my camera now and absolutely LOVE IT!! It takes beautiful, clear shots indoor and out. Power zoom can be lots of fun if you are into that kind of thing...and the movies - GORGEOUS! Fun little extras as well - 3D photos, etc. My only complaints at this time is that there is no thread at the end of the lens for add-ons or protection. I worked it out and purchased a lens adapter with a set of macro lenses and uv filter which should fix my problem. I had upgraded from my beloved Panasonic Lumix fz35 which was an all around great camera. I dropped it, over-worked it and it just kept on going. Unfortunately, there was a tiny scratch on the lens which would occasionally produce a smudge on my beloved macro shots and I knew it was time to replace it. Prior to that camera I had a Sony Mavica - can you tell I don't buy cameras very often? Stuck between two brands that I knew to be excellent, I made the jump back to a Sony. I did take a few shots using a LED ring, which I had to hold because my lens adapter has yet to arrive, and they came out great. I will upload those for anyone who is interested.

I tried it out by taking pictures of a Blue Heron on the dock behind his house and was amazed at the details when I zoomed in on the Heron's eyes and beak. (Keep it in mind it was a bright, sunny day). I waited for about six months before Amazon had a sale and the camera was marked down over $100. So I finally bought it and was excited when the camera arrived. What I discovered over the course of the following weeks is that the camera has some nice qualities but some flaws as well. First, the camera seems to capture the clearest picture (and the finest detail) when it is a bright environment and you are close to the object (even three or four inches). Unfortunately, the picture quality decreases significantly when there is low light or it is partly cloudy. The picture quality also decreases when you use the zoom. Next, the camera is highly sensitive to movement (even when you set the hand motion feature). I like to photograph animals in the wild and most of the shots are blurred because the animal moves slightly or I move because I am using the zoom feature. On occasion, the camera does recognize low light situations and makes adjustments accordingly. There is a camera guide that you can access on the camera itself. but it is difficult to navigate. I recently downloaded the manual from the website.in hopes of understanding the various camera features (of which there are quite a few). I may be expecting too much for the price as I realize there are digital cameras well over a $1,000.

I have all but stopped using my older DSLR (Nikon D70) since getting this camera.  The pictures are more crisp (18mp, baby) and the 30x optical zoom is amazing.  With the zoom and a tripod I got some spectacular moon shots with a ton of crater detail.  The image stabilization feature works surprisingly well, especially on stuff below 20x zoom.  It works OK beyond that, but you'll notice a little blur when you zoom in.  Once again, this is a feature that I didn't have on my DSLR.  I got some pretty cool shots of a family of loons that were aided by the image stabilization feature.  And if you've ever encountered loons, they don't particularly like to get close to people.The only slight downside to this camera is its size.  It is not going to fit in your pocket.  So this wouldn't be a good replacement for a small point-and-shoot camera that you can stick in your jeans pocket (I have a Nikon Coolpix that goes just about everywhere with me).  That being said, no camera that size will take anywhere near the quality shots that you'll get from this camera.Another huge bonus was getting this camera on sale; it was a steal at $250.  Having used it for about 6 weeks now, I'd have to say that $400-450 would be a reasonable asking price for this thing.  It's that good.Other items that I would purchase with this camera:-If you don't already have large capacity SD cards (16+ Gb), I'd recommend grabbing one, if not two, for use with this camera.  With great image quality comes great memory usage.-I would also recommend grabbing one of the two battery/charger combos (can be found for under $30 here on Amazon).  The camera does come with a charging cable, but it can only be charged via USB.  The battery charger can be used with regular wall outlets or with via the included car adapter.  Having a few extra batteries is key (especially if you constantly have the viewfinder on and are taking lots of pictures) as the battery will typically run out faster than the SD card will fill up.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Takes great pictures!", "Author": "Thomas Block", "ReviewID": "R2Z8CGQZR3TKLZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 5th Sony Camera and this one is the best of them all..

So far this one is best for a point & shoot with a long zoom.  The Clear Image zoom doubles your range without any noticeable loss of quality, but turn off the Digital zoom.  The Image Stabilization is excellent, until you enter the Clear Image Zoom range. The image quality is excellent for daytime shots and the flash has an impressive range.  Night time zoomed shots leave a larger sensor to be desired, however an SLR with that much zoom would be cost prohibitive.  Play around with Contrast, Sharpness, Noise Reduction to see how \"low\", \"standard\", or \"high\" work in combination for your shooting situation.  Get to know the settings of this camera.  The ISO up to 1600 is very good, but try setting it to 100 and let the camera automatically adjust the shutter speed and aperture.  Play with the shutter speed and aperture to see how they affect the picture, especially with those moon shots.  The Superior Auto with its automatic High Dynamic Range can give you surprisingly good photos in difficult lighting.  The tilting screen is very handy, and the viewfinder, tho not great (but better than some), works in a pinch.  The eye sensor for the viewfinder is a plus.  The grip is good.  You learn to remember to remove the lens cap before powering up the camera.  And yes, a threaded lens would be nice so we can use a protective filter.  I need to investigate to see if there is an adapter.  Disappointed AVCHD video is not compatible with Mac, but the MP4 is pretty good.  The jog dial to access frequently used settings is handy.  The battery life is excellent!  A stand alone charger would be appreciated, instead of the cumbersome long cords and transformer that are space eaters and awkward in the camera bag.To all the people remarking about slow focus, slow between shots, slow after changing a setting or changing a mode on the dial - simply press the shutter button half way in any of those situations and the window will immediately return to \"ready\" to shoot, no waiting.To those who are wanting the User Guide handy, pretty much the whole Guide is inside your camera.

You sweep the camera and it does the rest, however if you're like me and want more control, or want to access the individual shots to make the panorama on a PC, then you're out of luck.  The zoom is great as well as the image stabilization, and even the over zoom is useable.  If you look at the individual pixels you'll see a bunch of noise and noise reduction artifacts, however in practice if you shoot at the maximum resolution and reduce the image for printing or albums, most of that noise fades away.  Think of it like scanning a newspaper or magazine picture at high res.  You'll see all the dots, however if you shrink it by 50%, the dot screening goes away.  Anyway, great camera.

This is my second cyber shot and I was so happy with my first one I bought this updated version without doing much intensive research on other brands since the reviews and prices were comparable for the features.The most noticeable thing for me is that even though I am not strictly steady this really helps me to take clear pictures.  Also the zoom and focus is powerful, easy to use, and, again, allows for very clear shots.  Overall usage is very intuitive and just took me one read through to understand.

It is way too light, handy, fun, and user friendly to be in that category. This is my third ultrazoom and as much as I wanted blazing fast shutter speeds and extreme low light capabilities, buying another ultrazoom was a no-brainer in the end. I broke ties with Olympus this time, purely because I needed the GPS capabilities of the current Sony line, which includes a GPS log and electronic compass, which have been accurate and quick so far. The electronic compass is touchy, but they all are. Ultimately, these functions could save me hundreds of hours in my environmental consulting business, since the location and direction taken for each photo must otherwise be recorded by hand.I've found photo quality to be excellent in good light and fair to good in low light. The camera has some settings for compensation in low-light situations and they can be quite effective at times. I love love love the Backlight Correction HDR scene setting, especially when taking shaded forest shots on a bright day. It doesn't result in great shots, but it makes otherwise impossible high-contrast shots possible and even at times attractive. The video has been a gem so far, but I have yet to really test it. Lastly, the zoom is absolutely sick. It has been fully fictional all the way to 30x in nearly all light conditions, with photos blown up to the size of my computer screen. That was not the case with my past ultrazooms. I've already shot several great shots at 30x in moderately low light with no tripod or support. It does suffer in very low light, but what can really be expected without $2,000 + worth of heavy cumbersome equipment.  This has been an amazing camera for birding and other wildlife photography. I almost always have it around my neck to quickly snap some crazy telephoto shot of an eagle circling 1000 ft above and seconds later a macro of a wildflower at my feet, all geocoded. The versatility is unmatched.The things I do not like: (1) The camera has a cheap and slightly clumsy feel, more so than my Olympus SP570UZ. My first impression was not great, but it improved quickly after that. And while I wish is was rock solid, I'm glad it is not heavier. (2) The zoom motor seems to strain a bit and zoom response can be delayed at times. (3)The plug in charge cord is stiff and not very portable. (4) Camera and software seem to lack the functionality to photostamp the location and direction information on the photos and use it to name the photos. Instead I will be buying $70 worth of software to do those relatively simple functions.All told, I would buy it all over again. The unique functionality of the GPS made it a no-brainier for me.

I wish I could upload some photos so you can see how ridiculous it is. You even won't be able to recognize the objects anymore!

It doesn't happen alot and does not affect my photo saving capabilities, but is rather annoying.  It will start by saying the camera cannot read the memory card and to reinsert it.  I do that and then it will freeze.  I will take out the battery and put it back in.  This fixes the issue and I am good to go.  This is the reason for the 3 stars.  This is a big feature that should work appropriately.  I might have given it 4 stars, but this camera is not listed in Lightroom 4 for sync purposes.  Which is more of an issue for Lightroom, but Sony really should work with Adobe to make sure all their cameras work their software since it is the most popular out there.Overall, the camera is good for the price.  You can have added control to customize your shots, while keeping the ease of a point and shoot.

I have been using a Canon SLR for the past five years, so a lot of my experience (and basis / comparison for this review) is using the Canon as a benchmark.  I am not a professional photographer, just a husband and a dad that takes a few pictures in our walk of life.If you are a professional photographer, or use a camera with a bunch of different lenses, this is not for you.  However, if you are looking for an upgrade to the super-basic Android or iPhone camera, as well as something better than all of the $150 models that are out there, this one should be one for you to consider.This camera is a little larger than I thought, and is not something you can put in your pocket or a small purse - it does, however, fit great into a backpack or medium sized purse and I used it to take pictures at a kid's birthday party with no problem and the pictures turned out crisp, detailed, and I really saw no issue with the camera slowing down trying to compensate while I was trying to get a picture of a child running from one location to the other.I also took some pictures in bright sun of some flowers in my garden, and I was pleased with the rich details that were processed.  One thing to watch out for is this thing zooms in really fast - there is a slight delay and, if you have the button pressed continuously it's like there is a half second pause, then \"bam\" you are zoomed in 100% and need to gradually back off to get things in the right perspective.I'm not real sure how long the battery will last before the thing will die.  I took about 50 shots in-between each charge - not that the battery was dead, just that I was done for the day and put it on the charger before I went to bed.  This thing does have a fairly large adapter hookup for charging, and this is yet another product with another adapter I have to keep up with and find space to store.Overall, this is a very nice mid-priced point and shoot camera and something to consider for the casual, non-professional photographer user and the zoom and adapter \"issues\" above really aren't issues but nitpicks.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony & Amazon You Are Te Best !", "Author": "Ralph Ames", "ReviewID": "R2UFUFALBKIU5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very pleased with my NEW SONY CYBER-SHOT DSC-HX200V.

After doing some research, a mid-range quality of Camcorder will be around $300 to $800 (depend on brand). At the same time, my old camera is death and I of course want to shoot some still pictures too. Therefore, I go to search for the camera (pretty good one). I know some professional Digital Camera (DC) can up to $1000 or even $5000. To be honest, I am not professional photographer. I barely know the basic of shooting picture. A mid-range is good for me (point and shoot usually). And because of the coming baby, I want to learn more photo shooting. (taking better moment for her)Now Combination of the video taking and still picture. I found a Nikon first, but the main problem is the zooming while taking video. The recording is blur because of focus problem. It is a huge problem for video taking while zoom. Moreover, the Nikon does take 1080P video but only limited to 30fps. On the other hand, Sony does not have those problem. (full 60fps & 1080p)On the still picture quality, because I am not a professional photographer, I cannot give a 100% accurate comment but I am satisfied with it. I own Cannon and Panasonic point and shoot cameras before and the Sony absolutely is better with great price. The Image quality is Good for me.The less one star is because of the Amazon. I place the order at March 1st and shipped by super saving shipping (expectation date is March 7th to 9th). However, Amazon ships my product on March 6th after I request on live chat regarding adjusting the price. I did get the package on 8th, but how comes Amazon takes that long to process my package and shipped from NJ. (at that time the website does not show it will take 1 or 2 more days to process) My Point is Newegg does not have this problem even it is free shipping. For example, Newegg shows it will take 3 to 4 business days but sometimes I get my product within 2 days, if shipped from NJ (I am at NY). That is the right attitude for running a business, not 100% making money charging for shipping.

It has many smart features built in.  For example, I don't have to change setting if I want to shoot a very close up object.  All you need to do is keep the function selection dial at i-auto mode and bring the camera close to the object.  Be careful using the zoom function because the telescoping lens may touch the object.  Another nice thing this camera has is when I playback the video, I can snap shot a frame that I like to become a photo right on the camera.  It comes in handy when you are bored on an airplane.  The 30x feature is nice, 50x is even better.  But, the size and weight become concern to me.  Also, it will be harder to hold the camera still at full zoom.  So it's a trade off. The thing I don't like so far is if you accidentally touch the power on button, the telescope lens will extend out to a default position, which will half way out the lens cover.  It could be engineering a little better.  Also, the video recording button is a little confusing.  You can change the function dial to the video mode first and push a standalone red button to record, or, just just push the red button will let you record as well.  Humm..I have this camera for a few weeks now, and still learn to use it.One thing I want to point out:  the seller of this camera is KNOCKOUT DEAL via amazon.  Good price.  But, there is no sony warranty document come with it. Also, the lens has a smear spot on it when I received the package.  It looks like the seller has done something on it and repackaged.

If you haven't been bit yet by the photo bug then this is a great start, it has features that will cost thousands of dollars in a modular system (camera body, GPS module, lenses to cover the focal/zoom range, a macro lens, neutral density filter, and more). The catch is that it doesn't do anything nearly as good as a DSLR or Compact System Camera (Like the NEX series), except that it's complete in a smallish and relatively inexpensive box. The fact that it lets you play with all of the creative options like Aperture, Shutter, and Manual Modes lets you learn and grow with this camera so that when you're ready to invest in a larger kit you'll have a better idea of what's important to you.Best features of this camera:+ Swivel screen, which although it won't let you take self portraits, helps teach you to explore taking photos from other angles.+ GPS, when mixed with photo apps like iPhoto, Picasa, or Lightroom let you remember where the photo was taken.+ Neutral Density filter built in makes it possible take longer exposures of things like water and clouds to smooth them out.+ Macro feature works well.+ At it's widest angle it has a reasonably fast 2.8 aperture.+ Sony smart auto features and panorama sweep modes work as well as ever.+ Lots of direct access buttons and dials.+ 30x zoom from wide angle to moon capturing long.Mixed bag:> Image quality... Sony compact cameras do a good job considering their size and I've been thrilled with the quality that comes out of their W/WX series cameras. White this one looks good it seems to over compensate for noise even at it's lowest levels. So it's fine for prints and the web, but enlarged you'll won't see as much sharpness as I would like.> The 10 FPS feature only lasts for 1 second... not long enough for many fleeting moments... and the other burst mode is 2 FPS which lasts for 5 seconds... long enough, but not fast enough. Since 10 full resolution photos seems to be the limit of the camera's buffer, I wish they would have but in a more practical 4 or 5 FPS mode which would last a couple of seconds, but still be fast enough to catch the decisive moment.Cons:- The lens cover is not built into the lens, they provide a lanyard that helps you from losing it. But when you turn it on it sticks half on half off and jams a little.- No hotshoe means discovering the joy of photographic lighting is pretty much a no go, also it limits low light photos (although it's passable as far as small cameras go.)- The view finder is really low resolution and is only really useful if the sun is to bright to use the main screen.- The minimum focus distance which is good at the wide angle falls off quickly, so you have to be far away from you subject if you want to really use that 30x zoom.- There are a lot of menus and they are not as easy to navigate as I would like. Fortunately there is a custom button which you can assign whichever important feature they decided to bury (like white balance).In conclusion, if you're going on a cruise or safari and you want to capture nature to remember the adventure while still enjoying yourself then this is a great camera. If you think you might want to learn photography, but don't want to drop a lot of money right away, this is a great camera. But if you want your whale or lion photos to be awe inspiring... then you will need to look at a larger kit, perhaps a Sony NEX or Alpha camrea with a fast telephoto lens.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just Love IT", "Author": "P.

The HD movies are impressive and I was very happy with the low light pictures I have taken inside and outside.

I got great shots of a subject on a hill at least 2 miles away from my patio - and the detail in the photo was great! The panorama mode worked great as well and the LCD screen is one of the brightest I have seen on a camera. My last camera was a Canon G series that served me well for five years before I lost it in Miami, but the Sony is in a class by itself and it would be cruel to compare the two. I haven't captured any movies yet but am confident the results will be fantastic as well.

The HX100 produces video that is exceptionally clean for a camera of this class, and even though the color is accurate, it is a little undersaturated. It looks like video shot from a pro camcorder with the color toned down. The HX200 looks like consumer video.The video image stabilizer is second to none. I can walk and shoot with this and get video that looks like it was shot on a steadycam rig.Many settings can be set manually, like focus and ISO setting. I depends upon the mode setting as to which functions can be over-ridden manually. Automatic exposure control is one that can't be over-ridden in any mode.Sound is very clear and crisp, and rarely distorts even at high level band volume.The form factor in the hand is very comfortable all day.

That is an eternity for any camera let alone a camera in this price range.The quality of the viewfinder is just mediocre, when the camera detects your eye it take a whooping two seconds to switch from LCD to viewfinder mode, that is an eternity when you are shooting fast action.On one hand this camera offers an easy way to shoot with a 30x zoom but if you are a pro I doubt you will be happy with the resulting noisy images. I tested the camera at noon in a snowy landscape and the noise was unacceptable compared to any other camera.There is one major design flaw. the power button is not recessed enough so the camera keeps turning itself on inside the bag hence extending the telephoto lens and getting jammed, this will most certainly damage the camera after a short while.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Manual focus and viewfinder", "Author": "Ethelred \"(Ready)\"", "ReviewID": "RG4WVCKYQZ9A5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I saw that this camera had manual focus capability and a viewfinder, I thought that my dream camera had arrived. My existing, otherwise excellent, point-and-shoot camera (SONY Cyber-shot DSC0HX5V) was a bitch to control focus when near and far items were in frame together and knowing WHAT was being photographed when in bright sunlight was a guessing game. Hence my purchasing this camera.Unfortunately, the switch that changes the function of the ring on the lens from zoom to manual focus worked only intermittently. That could just have been a dud, but more seriously, when the switch did work, the manual focus functionality was horrible. The scene presented through the viewfinder and on the rear screen was either a total blur (nothing in focus) or was focused on infinity even though the \"focus distance bar\" on the display indicated otherwise. I am not sure if this was simply another symptom of its being a dud or if it is supposed to operate that way.It's going back.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Photos look awful.

Upon doing loads of research, I decided I would try one of these \"like a DLSR point and shoot\" cameras.  My old point-and-shoot was a Sony Cyber-shot (I think I got it in 2006 or 2007) and it had really served it's purpose and is a great camera for still shots.  But now that I have a three year-old constantly on the move, I need something better.Here is what I was looking for in a camera:1) Easy to use.  I wanted to take GOOD pictures right away.2) Fast startup and FAST shutter speed (tired of waiting 4 seconds for my old camera to focus... the moment is over!)3) True-to-life color4) Good \"low-light\" shooting5) Versatility - easy quick shots AND nice quality real photography potential6) Good quality photographs7) Zoom potentialThe Sony kind of wowed me at the retail store.  It seemed faster than the other comparable cameras, like the  (Canon SX40 HS 12.1MP Digital Camera with 35x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch Vari-Angle Wide LCD and Nikon COOLPIX P510 16.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 42x Zoom NIKKOR ED Glass Lens and GPS Record Location (Black).  So I bought it with a 30 day \"hassle-free\" return.What a mistake!  After about 3 hours of playing with the this camera, I realized I HATED it.  The menu navigation is awful... I felt like I had to click around 40 times before I found what I was looking for, EVERY time.  While the shutter speed is fast, the focus is great sometimes, slow others.Photos taken on this camera look digital, and not in a good way.  Very flat pictures.The major dealbreaker for me was the TERRIBLE COLOR.  It was awful.  Not true to what the naked eye sees at all.  I wish I had kept an example.In the end, I returned the Sony and went with an entry-level Canon DSLR.  I'm in love.  The Canon DSLR is awesome and SUPER EASY to use.  I'm happy.SUMMARY: This is not a camera for someone who wants seriously gorgeous photos.

I ordered the latest Panasonic Lumix camera from Costco and have been super happy with it and so glad I went back to what my research had made clear to me that I should get.
