Here is what I've found. At high ISO settings (above 200) there is alot of noise (big suprise). I usally use the program mode and keep the ISO at 64 and my photos look great.I have not had the problem with purple fringing. I have tried and tried but I can't reproduce the problem. Is it as good as a $3,000.00 digital SLR? No, even though that's what it is constantly compaired to. The digital SLR that comes close in price is the EOS Digital Rebel. But by the time you buy a couple of lenses you are in the $1,500.00 range, that's 50% more and no you can't take a short video with the EOS. And the DSC-F828 color reproduction is better than the Canon. Is it better that other cameras in it's class? YES! I had a Fuji S7000 and had to return it, the photo quality and focusing problems were horrible. If you want to see purple fringing and noise look at a Fuji S7000 photo! The DSC-F828 takes crisp clear photos under all lighting conditions. It's Auto-focus is super fast and accurate. The camera body is solid. The lens has great range and the macro works great. The camera is EASY to use. You can use the infrared setting to take pictures in the dark without flash (yes they have noise) Or you can use the night framing to take a normal flash photo in the dark and they look great. Why 4 stars and not 5? The only drawback is that there is no black&white setting. I like to see what a photo is going to look like in black & white when I'm shooting. And the tech support is weak. I emailed tech support to see if they are going to do a firmware update and suggested a b&w setting. I like to use an IR72 infrared filter. And they gave me a lame response. \"We aren't going to add new chips to the camera.\" Tech support should know the difference between software and hardware. If your going to freak out about a little noise or you want to blow-up a photo to a poster size you can use Neat Image to remove any noise, and it's free for non-commercial use.", "Date": "January 19, 2004"}, {"Title": "This is one of the best non-PRO cameras!", "Author": "Max J. Pucher \"Max J. Pucher\"", "ReviewID": "RA3ZZF4KZEMD8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony F828 is an outstanding product for its price/quality/capability relationship. I have used all kinds of professional and semi-professional digital cameras over the years. Go ahead and compare it to a product 5 times its price and it will obviously come short. It does not replace a professional product, but for an ambitious amateur photographer and computer expert like me, who knows how to deal with the intricacies of a digital image, this is as good as it gets.The camera is solid, easy to use, identical in operation to all Sonys and works like an normal SLR. The image quality is outstanding, when you know how to use it and where the limits of CCD capturing are. If you have to work a lot in very low light conditions there is no substitute for highly sensitive film material. I flash everything and while the in-built flash is good, I would recommend to buy the HVL-F32X which is an excellent product and add-on. Learn to use the flash in every situation, even in bright sunlight to add clarity and to brighten the foreground against the background glare. I have used the flash for macro-photography and being able to shot with a hundred different camera and flash settings and then immediately check the outcome on my notebook is just incredible.I have used the ability to shoot a series of 7 images and it is simply stunning. This is the first time I have seen this work really well in a digital non-pro camera. I series-shoot everything now, then just delete the rubbish. With the CF and Sony slot you can have up to 2GB of images, in highest resolution this is 500 pictures! You do need 50 shots for ONE great photo. The zoom lens is excellent too and the camera is very pleasant and professional to hold. It has a great balance. The digital viewfinder as well as the LCD work perfectly. Color quality is typical Sony high-end quality and the color-tone is easily adjusted to your preference. One of the best features is the battery stamina (also typical Sony). With the standard battery I get 3 hours of continous use even when I use the flash.Overall, this is the first camera that truly substitues my previous high-end SLR set.", "Date": "January 2, 2004"}, {"Title": "A Tempramental Masterpiece!", "Author": "Sinister Minister", "ReviewID": "R20QFEMOR8M7YA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned my 828 about a year now and I have been amazed at the bashing this camera has and still does take. Even to the point of 828 online clubs devoted to the pictures and defense of this amazing camera! And yes this camera is amazing. As I have stated in my other reviews I sell cameras for BestBuy as well as work as a professional photographer so I will give you the straight and narrow on this camera. Ready? The fringe thing-I have taken about 2000 pictures with my 828 and in only one of them was I able to reproduce the famed purple fringing effect, this was using a long shutter exsposure on a city street at night, 1999 other shots in as many situations and not a trace. I even tried pointing the camera directly at the lights in the the bestbuy store (you know what those look like!) and guess what? \"Nada\" I just got a great picture of the bestbuy ceiling. So the conclusion on fringe? Get over it, it is such a rare occurance that it hardly warrants concearn. Noise: here is where a tend to agree with most critics your pics will get mad noisy at the 800 ISO setting, but few digital cameras wont, hell even Canon's 20D starts losing luster at a 800 ISO setting and that camera will go all the way upto 3200!! So turn down the ISO and take your pictures or learn to use photoshop or something and fix them. I mean this is a DIGITAL camera right? The thing these bozos don't tell you is that removing ISO noise from an image is an extremely easy thing to do, again, get over it. Having addressed the two main gripes about the 828 what are you left with? Lets start with the four color CCD. I have said this before and I'm saying it now: The 828 has the best color of ANY digital camera out there today! If your into outdoor pics, close ups, night shots (turn that ISO down) your pictures and thier color will be amazing! By the way touching on low light pics and the 828, I do alot of long exsposure shots with the 828 and they are always top notch! Battery life on the 828 is an impressive 240-300 minutes on a full charge! (no kidding)The Lense- the biggest part of the camera and the biggest attraction if you like focusing your camera yourself (with a little digital help). The lense is a Ziess made with little to no barrel distortion (flower lense hood is included! BONUS!!) and quite versitile as far as the focal ranges it will cover, this also brings me to the cameras construction, this baby is heavy but damn! it sure feels good! The 828 is the 2nd largest in its class, so if your into pocket toys you best be looking at Casio or HP cameras (sorry that was mean) The 828 is really a SLR camera with a lense on it you can't take off. End of story. The body reminds me of my Sony F-707 wich I loved ( probably the best 5MP camera ever made) The tilting body is a Godsend for the pro and joe shmoe alike! The eye piece is among the best out there and id diopter adjustable, the LCD screen is a little small 1.8 inches but is extrememly clear and sharp so it works for me. The 828 like its little brother the V3 shoots on Memory stick as well as Compact flash type I & II, and unlike the V3 the 828 can use micro-drives (I have a 4 gig in mine) All the controls on the camera are well placed and easy to master even for the beginner. However I found i got slightly better pictures in the \"P\" mode than in full auto, but a novice should always start in the auto mode. The 828 boasts the same range of shutter speeds and apatures as the DSC-V3 (see my review) wich as I have said before I think is a sane selection of ranges! All your options are useable so play, play, play!! The scene modes are pretty run of the mill: Landscape, night shot, low light portrait, snow, tropical sun, and candle light. The white balancing features are pretty dead bang but watch out for the blues- I leave mine set to auto unless im shooting outside then I'm pretty safe. Sonys X-32 flash and this camera are a match made in heaven but thanks to the ACC port your old one will work too, but I can't stress enough the benefit of Sony's. Sony still has the on board crop feature. (other cameras do this but only Sony lets you  determine the resolution of the cropped image!I have just barely touched on the features and capabilities of this camera ( I don't want to use up all of amazons web space) so let me leave you with these thoughts. Currently I own and run the following digital cameras: F-828, DSC-V3, Nikon 8700, and the Nikon 8800, all four of these are eceptionally high rated cameras, out of all the 828 remains my right hand camera. I will say in all honestly this is not an easy camera to use, It will make you think about your shots, make you work for them. This is NOT a point and shoot camera, it was never meant to be (people who love this camera will tell you this) So why all the bad press? Well, with this camera Sony made an awful lot of professionals toys run of the mill, this camera broke down alot of technology barriers (still does in fact)So alot of people went on the offensive looking for the fly in the ointment, wich can be found with any camera on the market today. So why the fuss? this is a genuine technology breakthru people, the real deal, and there ain't no going back. I apologize for the lack of technical data in this review I love this damn camera so much I tend to spend more time defending it than specing it out! But the proof is in the pictures so with that I'll rest my case. Because the strongest feature of the 828 is the most important one \"the pictures are fantastic!!\" If you want an easy to use camera, move on. If you like to fuss with things and tinker or play with your camera, have fun with your camera, create with your camera then add this puppy to your shopping cart. cause this is your beast.I have heard Sony is working on a successor to the 828 I can only hope it is half the camera! Bottom line... don't believe the hype or sour grapes folks this is the state-of-the art and has been for nearly 2 years.

The color is great, a high quality lens, the camera is fast, and EIGHT megapixels, well that's just AWESOME!  The 7x optical is also plus.  I pondered purchasing a Canon 10d until I read about Sony's 8mp f828 due out in November.  Despite the delay (and it's already on back order again) it was definitely worth the wait.  At $999.00 it is an incredible value.  At this time, you can't get close to 8 megapixels at this price. The body has a nice feel and is comfortable to hold.I planned on purchasing a digital SLR, but I did not want to get locked in to only 6mp just yet, when eight was around the \"affordable\" corner.I was using a nikon 5700, but returned it - focus was painfully slow and lens started to make a grinding noise when zoomed out.  It also had way too much noise.  The lens was qualtiy great along with the zoom, but it didn't make up for the negative aspects of this camera.The color on this camera is remarkable.  As a graphic designer, I work with professional photos and Photoshop a great deal.  We all know that Photoshop is a huge plus in the digital darkroom, but it DEFINITELY helps to start with sharp photos with a lot of pixels and great color.For the non-professional to consider: often digital photos have too much noise and not enough pixel information - something even Photoshop currently can't do miracles with.  I often hear consumers comment they don't need five, six or more pixels, because they won't be making such large prints these cameras offer.  However, after a photo is cropped of unnecessary background, your image needs still needs a lot of pixels to enlarge that portion.  That is a problem with 4mp and below.  Five is acceptable, six really good.  Eight -awesome!  In the next two years we'll all want 11mp or more, but you currently have to shell out $8,000 just for the camera body!There is also low noise with the f828, a problem with many other digital cameras.  I absolutely love it!  The color is so true to life.  Beautiful!  You can photograph fast-moving children and pets with wonderful results and get great indoor shots as well, an area the other cameras in this price range generally fall short.  This camera truly sets a new standard, and considering it's very reasonable price tag, definitely worth it!!!", "Date": "December 26, 2003"}, {"Title": "Wonderful camera...not to be confused with a DSLR", "Author": "J. P Richardson \"- JPR\"", "ReviewID": "R3CIR842F3PDVE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ive been doing photography for nearly 10 years. It paid my bills at one point but now its more of an active hobby. Ive also given advice to many people as to what type of camera to buy. I have yet to have someone come back disappointed.I prefer film to digital but digital is cheaper. I didnt want a DSLR ( didnt want to pay 2k for one ). So I started looking at the 8M batch. I did a lot of research and read reviews at just about every site. In the end I went with the sony and I havent been disappointed.THE GOOD: - The pictures are crisp, colors strong and the lens and focusing are fast. - The 7x zoom range is versatile. The 28mm wide angle is especially welcome to us landscape photographers. - The macro ( close up ) is jaw dropping. You can get close enough to get the texture on a dollar bill. - The night framing function is amazing for taking pictures in little to no light at all. - The scroll button and 'joystick' for menu functions are fabulous and the menus easy to navigate. - The LCD and viewfinder and bright and clear. - The manual zoom lens is a VERY welcome relief from nasty electronic zooms. - The twistable camera body is fabulous if you need to shoot from waist level or at an angle above your head. - The camera feels fabulous in the hands ( and looks darn sexy ).All in all, the camera is wonderful for an experienced user. An amateur could benefit from learning on this camera as its very user friendly. The seasoned user will be right at home. The professional photographer might consider this a back up camera.THE BAD: - CA/Purple Fringe - Noise above ISO 200Yes, as youve heard these do exist. However, they can be prevented and or eliminated afterward.The purple fringe usually happens with big apertures. The 828 has f2 so its going to happen more often. This however, has been blown out of proportion. The PF will very rarely be a serious issue. Stopping down your aperture can reduce it. If that isnt an option you can greatly reduce/eliminate it in post processing ( photoshop ).The high noise at the upper iso's is a common problem in film as well as digital. Unless you are shooting 400+ you wont even notice it on a 4x6 print or on screen. Keep your iso low unless you need to capture something at high speed. There are also several wonderful post-processing programs that can reduce/eliminate the noise.Dont believe the hype about these two problems. A little knowledge goes a long way.FINAL THOUGHTSAn amazing camera that will produce amazing pictures and prints. Its very user friendly.I cant stress enough: This is NOT a digital slr. Anyone getting this camera expecting it to be will be disappointed. For the rest of us, its a wonderful addition to your camera family.", "Date": "July 28, 2004"}, {"Title": "A camera of extremes - good and bad", "Author": "John Martin \"madmartha\"", "ReviewID": "R3R9U9F2LWPNR1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been using this camera extensively for two weeks, although it belongs to a friend. I suppose that may make me more objective than someone who actually owns one, because I don't have to rationalize having made a $1000 investment. I wanted very much to like this camera, and there are certain things that I love about it. However, there is no way that I could use this as my primary camera.First, the good. It is absolutely the coolest lens I have ever seen, particularly on a digital camera. The zoom covers almost any shooting situation I would need, from landscape, to portraits, to sports. The fact that you can zoom by turning a ring makes it far superior to the \"fly by wire\" zooms so common on digital cameras.The user interface is great. It is far better than other digital cameras I have owned by Nikon, Olympus, Pentax and Ricoh. I was able to use just about every cool feature without ever looking at the owner's manual. It is very intuitive. It is much easier to use than a Nikon film camera as well.Mechanically, the camera is a gem. It feels about as rugged as my Nikon F5 (although it probably isn't.) It is incredibly solid.It is also very fast, both in the time it takes to turn on and off, and also in terms of delay when you push the shutter. For all intents and purposes, there are no delays at all, except sometimes when writing an image to storage, but even that is faster than on most other cameras. It is just a very responsive camera.Battery life is great. I never ran low, and only charged it occasionally.The movie mode is great. Easy to use, and good quality images and sound. It wouldn't totally replace a video camera, but it would be fine for occasional use.Now, the bad. All the negative things you may have read about purple fringing are true. It is not difficult to find a scene where this shows up in an unacceptable way.The white balance is really off in many scenes I've photographed. Snow looks medium grey. I know that I could probably do better on this if I read the manual, or post processed in Photoshop, but it is disturbing that with the default settings, it records scenes so inaccurately.It is not a great camera for available light. I was not able to handhold it for shots that could esily be done with my Olympus 5050. I think it is partly because of the aperature, and partly because it is an extremely long camera, where any movement is exaggerated.In side by side comparisons, some of the images from my 5 megapixel Olympus are superior to the 8 megapixel Sony 828 images, in terms of color and sharpness.Sony is really on to something here, and it is possible that some of these problems could be fixed in a future version. But I am not planning to buy one of these now.The weird thing is that now the bar has been set very high for what I would want from a user interface and lens. So even if I found a camera with better image quality (which wouldn't be hard), it would not compare favorably to the Sony in other dimensions. This two week testing period makes me want to wait a while for Sony to fix the issues with the 828, or for other companies to catch up to Sony in terms of other features.", "Date": "January 31, 2004"}, {"Title": "Good camera, sneaky Amazon and reseller", "Author": "Josh Daniel S.

It turned out that the order was forwarded to USAPhotoNation, not Amazon.  It wasn't a zShops order, it was Amazon's own internal order.After looking more in depth, USAPhotoNation does this.  Sells cheap, cancells, gets you to call, and they try to sell you overpriced accessories.  Aparently there was some problem with part 2 and they just cancelled the order.Amazon was not willing to work out a deal or compensation regarding the price they promised and for which they accepted money.  I did get a full refund on the camera, but I still have the accessories which I wouldn't have purchased in a split order.As for the camera itself, it has a great optical zoom, takes pictures in low-low light, supports compact flash as well as memory stick pro, has a manual focus ring, and otherwise does all of the things that all of the other sony DSCs do combined into one.  It is a bit bulky, but it's well worth it if you're serious about photos.There are some reports of purple streaks, but this is generally lense flair.  A $30 filter kit will increase the crispness in odd lighting and will also protect your lense from dirt.The camera is a bit bulky, but this is to be expected with a decent optical system.  It's great for those of us with bigger hands as you can get a really good grip on it.So, I highly recommend this camera, but I highly recommend against using Amazon to purchase it.

We shoot professionally for a conference brochure print publication, inside shooting, no staged shots, using the artificial lighting in the hotel meeting rooms. We also do trade stock shots primarily of landscape scenes in Hawaii, so we push cameras pretty hard.  The 707 was fun, but slow, almost unusable for brochure work, the 717 was a big improvement and the 828 is truly awesome.  The colors are great, the operating system is fast, you will never lose a shot even with indoor sports, the shooting modes help you adapt to any situation.  The 8 Mega Pixel (MP) means you can take a full body shot and if you find you need a head shot instead you have plenty of resolution.  Sony has really worked on the layout of buttons and that is a major improvement, no more accidental white balance disasters.  And the control modes wheel appears to be more robust ( I touched the 717 wheel with some suntan lotion on my hand and it removed all the painted modes ).The 828 is my favorite digital and with 8 MP I can get the speed to print of digital with every bit of the quality of 35mm film at this point.  My wife prefers the Canon EOS-10D with the 828 as her second favorite and to be sure you can put some very fast lenses on that Canon body.My advice to you if you are considering buying is to avoid anything on the low end, if you get less than 5 MP your shots are not worth printing.  Don't scrimp on memory sticks either, you would be amazed at how fast you go through a 128M memory stick shooting 8 MP shots and we won't even talk about TIFF mode.And if you invest the money in an 828, really push it. Read your manual and see what this critter is capable of. Play with the nightshot mode, it really works!  Some of my favorite shots are from a shark tank with nightshot, it looks like I was actually swimming with the beasts.  Try to catch something fast like a bird with the burstmode; what a great way to fill a memory stick with a single button push.  Play with the AE lock, it really takes a picture with dificult lighting over the top.These are great days to be alive, who would have ever guessed we would have tools like the Sony 828 at a sub 1k pricepoint?

Spivack", "ReviewID": "R3NYHLA1ZHWH8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I relate my tale about buying this camera through Amazon (ultimately, I did not, not for lack of effort on my part) let me detail some of what I think is terrific about this camera.I had a DSC-F717 and that camera took remarkable photos. It was intuitive and pretty (silver!) and the buttons were all in the right places. In short order, I felt like a pro taking pictures with it and the results were really good (if you want, email me and I'll link you to some pictures. The only problem with F717 was it was a little cheap in construction so when it began turning on and off randomly (some problem in the hinge I think) it was time to look for a new camera.Since all my accessories are Sony (from the F717) it was natural to look to Sony for solutions. The F828 was the next level and the changes they made appear stunning.Gone is the silver. It is now a serious textured black. No one who looks at this camera wonders if its a toy. They may wonder if its a weapon of some kind but it feels good in the hand. It balances much better than the F717 and the key layout, although I'm still getting used to it, makes a little more sense. No more using software purely to delete pictures. There's a button for that. Same thing for White Balance. WB is the most important feature I've ever found on a digital camera and very few people use it. I use it before EVERY shot.  Before on the F717, I had to look for a button among a nest of buttons. Now, its right on top right near the shutter.Next among cool reasons to like this camera is the holographic AF. This (like the F717) camera prjects a visible grid of laser light to detail the subject being photographed. The focus is tight and pretty.  I haven't had a chance to play with depth of field but if its like the F717, it will be a strong suit.It is also very fast. I can now take pictures about as quickly as I hit the shutter. On the F717, it took time.The only negatives so far is that the camera is heavy. It balances well in the hand, but I have to find a way to carry it thats a little more comfortable. It will work out. I bought the bag (which I'll review separately and that I did buy on Amazon) and it fits into it well, but there's no pocket to hold the charger. Ah well, gotta charge at home and carry batteries.Last, I'd like to relate my experience in purchasing the camera.Amazon listed the camera as $454. This was listed in its main price, not through a reseller, auction or Amazon shop. I clicked buy, checked the pricing and hit Submit Order.  Surprise! It was a third party reseller named USAPhotonation.com.  I got a confirmation that said (pasted) \"we're writing to confirm your purchase of the following item from USA PhotoNation: 1 of Sony DSC-F828 8MP Digital Camera with 7x Optical Zoom [Camera](available to ship by 28-October-2004)Amazon Payments has charged your credit card (DELETED) for thispurchase, and the funds have been credited to USA Photo Nation.\"Having checked out resellerratings.com ([...] ) I basically saw that this company seemed to be a bunch of crooks. Out of a rating of 1 to 10 (10 being the best possible) they scored a .64 as rated by 43 people. I wrote Amazon who reassured me.  On Amazon there were no ratings. Apparently I was the first time they'd ever been referred business by Amazon.After a flurry of email exchanges between Amazon and myself, a few fired off to USA Photo Nation, which they never bothered to answer and over 2 hours on hold at their customer service number, they informed me that my order was cancelled and I could expect a refund, which I did get.Amazon seemed to wash their hands of it. I got my money back and the next best price on another camera was north of $900 and they weren't going to supply a camera at the price I was confirmed (by them) because, they said, it was the reseller who didn't deliver the product. I, on the other hand, had NO idea I was dealing with a reseller and would never have used that particular reseller after viewing their online ratings.I bought the camera at a Best Buy. I paid over double what Amazon assured me was the price and I'm pleased with my purchase. I'm a little angry at Amazon however. I've done a lot of business with them over the years and I think their relationship with the reseller does not absolve them of their responsibility to provide what they confirm has been purchased.So, for my review, this is a great camera, one that is heavier duty than my F717 and much faster. But if you are thinking about buying it through Amazon, I'd advise caution. Make sure it isn't a reseller or if it is, that they have reasonable rating for delivering on time what they promise.", "Date": "November 1, 2004"}, {"Title": "Why are the PROS reviewing this Camera?

It certainly contributes to the camera's weight, but for me the improved image quality makes this \"weight in gold\", not dead weight. The lens combined with the macro setting, for instance, has helped to make some remarkable pictures.Add to this the bells'n'whistles of the multi-point autofocus (hey, I _make_ pictures; I don't pretend to be an actual photographer, nor do I play one on TV!), the night-shot system, and the slow-shutter noise reduction and I have been a very happy picture maker.

It is now 2 months later and I wouldn't consider giving up my F828.It is true there is purple fringing in high contrast situations (like bright sun shining between small branches in a tree).  In most cases this is only visible when you magnify the image many times on your PC monitor. It is apparent in less than 10% of my photos and I have never needed to correct for it when printing.  I had one instance where it was visible at full size and corrected it easily in my photo editing program - took about 60 seconds.  This is much easier to fix than lens flaring, image softness or the exposure problems you can find in many digital cameras.  Of course, I would rather the camera be perfect but I've been around photo equipment for decades (35mm, medium format, digital) and trust me - there will always be something.The F828 is a delight to use, combines a great lens and body into a well built, reasonably compact package. It has excellent battery life (a huge problem for some digitals) and delivers great image quality. I think you will be amazed at the detail you will see.  You can set it to automatic or use a host of manual features - all of which are easily accessible.  I can't tell you how handy the 828's swivel lens/body is.  My first digital camera had it (Nikon 990) and I considered it a must-have feature for its replacement.Do you need an all-in-one solution i.e. camera and lens together? Are you looking for vastly improved image quality over say a 3-4 megapixal digital?  Do you need it now?  If YES, get the Sony - you won't find a better choice.  If no, you might wait a bit and look at the other 8 megapixal cameras that will be rolling out over the next few months (I've already seen a few but none beat the overall quality of the 828).  If you don't care about physical size, then one of the new digital SLRs from Nikon or Canon might be a good choice - but remember you have to buy the body and lens separately, they are more expensive, and you've got to haul all that stuff around with you - I take my camera on business trips and just don't have the room.

Many people have complained about it and recomend getting another camera, I recomend and exchange.  You will be happy with a working F-828.  Mine has been working for months flawlessly.Noise is a normal thing in photography, even 35mm photography has noise at any ISO, but since 35mm would be like a 20 (twenty) megapixel camera you don't notice noise on film unless you get a BIIIG picture, or zoom in on it a lot.  So noise is not a problem with the F-828.  In fact I like the effect of 800 ISO combined with Sepia.  Besides, if you print an 8 Megapixel image at 6 X 4 you won't notice noise even at 400 ISO.I've also heard people complain that at 28mm wide angle the image is distorted.  Of course it is, any camera with a wide angle at 28mm will distort an image.  It is mostly used for landscapes and special effects, some people will even use wider angle lenses.  Most cameras start their zoom at 35mm or 45mm which is less of a wide angle, thats why they have less distortion.  Portraits are shot mostly with zoom 80mm or above so that there is no sitortion at all.This camera is not Professional, but I consider it at least Semi-Pro.  The thing about Professional cameras is; they are serious equipment, so if you make a living out of it, get a Professional camera, but don't expect tu use a serious professional camera to fool around and play.The SONY F-828 can be treated seriously and taken seriously, but you can also use it for your normal life, play around with it, take video (at high quality I find it as good as any DV camera), it's great.It might be big but the bigger lens gives better quality, it might not be light, but weight helps me keep the camera steady.You can trim (crop) or resize pictures you have taken, the only thing you can't do (olympus does have this feature) is copy pictures between Memory Stick and Compact Flash.

The gold chain holding a light on the ceiling had a red glow to one side of it (I assume that is the purple and gold mixing). Every single shot (shot towards light) had a noticable purple fringe.I reviewed the same shots with the F717. For the first time, I noticed the \"purple fringe\" on my F717.

I love the new settings for color. You can have the camera display the \"real\" color or there is another setting that slightly saturates your images. This is called \"standard\" mode. I found I was always saturating my F717 shots via Photoshop so this is a welcome feature for me. Sony's new 4 color processing gives you more realistic color. I have compared may shots from my F717 an I like the color better on the F828.For the first time Sony has included another pic storage option besides their incredibly expensive memory sticks. You can now use compact flash cards. They are about half the price of memory sticks so you won't have to sell your car to get 1 megabyte of storage. You can use Memory stick and Compact flash together. There is a switch to go back and forth between the 2. This means you can theoretically have 2 gigs of storage before you have to change a memory card. Another cool feature is smart zoom. The camera is capable of 8 megapixel photos. I use 5 megapixels generally. Smart zoom will let you add to the 7x zoom if you are not using the highest resolution. It does this automatically. Very cool. So the lower resolution you are using the more zoom you can use.I love the night framing mode. Normally it is impossible to see your subject in the view screen when you are taking pics at night. This camera has infrared so you can see a black and white outline of your subjects when taking pics in total darkness. This really helps frame your subject. The pic you take however come out in color and generally it is perfectly in focus! Then, when you push the shutter button, the camera emits a laser beam on your subject. It lets the camera know the exact distance your subject is from the camera. I have taken some great, in focus shots in total darkness!

But it's a significant, additional in-house service we provide. This met my particular needs for an upgrade from the F707...and, yes, I wrestled with the same issues people have mentioned here. So, this is a pretty detailed, often technical evaluation:ALL-IN-ONE VS. DSLR:*SLR mirror noise is intrusive in many of my shooting situations, i.e., arts events, rehearsals,*I don't need to carry the additional weight of extra lenses at live events,*Dealing with sensor dust could ruin my client's day.8MP NOISE:*Unavoidable with that many sensors on a 2/3\" chip. I shoot ISO64-100, 200 if necessary. I can always clean it up with Noise Ninja if required. I'll take the extra detail.CHROMATIC ABERRATION (CA)/PURPLE FRINGING:*Unavoidable in digital cameras (that purple border around light sources such as bulbs, sun reflections). Pretty bad in this camera.*Solution: I post almost everything anyway. Photoshop CS fix with judicious use of the sponge tool is easy. Lots of solutions posted online.ALTERNATIVE CAMERAS?*Canon Powershot Pro1 was the only other competitor for me. But, had no live histogram, nonexistent low-light AF, and half the battery life of the F828. Nikon (8700) lens disappointing @ only 35mm equiv. wide, proprietary front filter mount. Olympus performance was dismal.*Sony R1 (10MP): MUCH bigger sensor/less noise. But, R1's 120mm zoom equivalent couldn't match the F828's 200mm (f2.8 vs. f2.0 wasn't an issue, considering sensitivity of different chips). R1 front filter is 67mm vs. 58mm on the F828, meaning fewer and/or more expensive accessory lens options for the R1 - except heavy, expensive proprietary Sony adapters. Disliked the top-mounted LCD on the R1.WHY THE F828 WORKS FOR ME:*Immaculate Zeiss lens,*Manual zoom,*Same (now) classic Sony swivel body for easy overhead/ground shots...solid, solid, solid,*Fast hologram AF,*Speed or framing (yes!) burst, bracket exp,*RGBe sensor solves the problem of overblown reds in previous models, excellent depth,*Expanded, though still easy, menu navigation/thumbwheel/joystick,*Both CFII media (I use 5GB) & Memory Stick (faster..I use ProDuo 2GB),*Compatable with standard 58mm thread accessories (filters, adapters, etc.),*Simplified single button delete on review or PB.And a note on Sony proprietary flash (i.e., the HVL-F32X):I use the Promaster DX5500 which may be the only other hotshoe mount that talks to the Sony. The advantage is x-axis rotation - which the Sony doesn't have - particularly useful in bounce flash situations.In short, the issue of whether this is a good product or not is moot.

I admit there is still a considerable amount of learning for me to do with this camera.  The Carl Zeiss T* lens is just incredibly, and the 4-color CCD does seem to render colors better. I am consistently impressed by how eye color and detail is captured by this camera.....by far the best I have seen in a \"non D-SLR\" digital camera. OK, now onto the niggles....(1) Yes there is some noise from ISO200 and above, but there are others in this boat also, and there is a noise reduction feature in the \"twilight\" profile. Neat Image software does an acceptable job mitigating the noise in most images. The FujiFilm S-7000 (my previous selection) has a horrible reputation for high ISO noise, and apparently has some real issues trying to autofocus in low-light. Were it not for Howard Creech's appraisal in Epinions, I would have an S-7000 and probably be pretty pissed off. (2) Purple fringing.....stated by so many as being Chromatic Aberration, is most likely due to CCD Blooming. I believe this is CCD Blooming due to overloaded pixel elements dumping onto adjacent pixel elements and you get purple fringe.  I have seen night shots of city waterfront areas, and on \"auto\" there is significant fringing, but in \"aperture priority\", with a small aperture the purple is very slight.  Makes sense......less light entering the lens equals fewer CCD pixel elements overloaded. Also, I recently began using a circular polarizing filter, and this really helps control situations where harsh glare would induce \"the fringe\". The Carl Zeiss T* lens, while not an \"apochromatic lens\", has extremely high optical qualities. If there is some chromatic aberration to blame for the purple fringe, the F828 has nearly every other digital camera as company in that department!I really like this camera, and I feel quite strongly it was the best $919.00 I have ever spent.

So far as I could tell, none of those cameras got better pictures of that trip than the Sony, and most of them had to worry a lot more about dust and water, due to their interchangeable and add-on lenses.My one caution is that you can't use the 30 FPS movie mode with CompactFlash memory.

I had used the DSCF717 previously on numerous occosions, (as well as a Nikon DX1), and was shocked at the improvements that Sony made with the DSC F828 model.The processor in the DSC F828 processes an 8 MP image in half the time that the DSC F717 processed a 5 MP image - an impressive technological feat that really pays off when shooting image sequences.  I  have tested the mpeg features and find the clarity of the image and sound output to be professionally acceptable for a multimedia producer. I plan to use this feature frequently.Two really impressive new features are the storage of image data in RAW format and the ability to use microdrives for storage.  Using a 1 Gig microdrive allows me to store over 100 RAW data files.  The benefit of this is that the RAW data can be manipulated to increase or decrease white balance, color, and exposure AFTER the photo has been taken.Add to that the control and range of a manual focus lense,  Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* 7X Zoom lens (28 - 200mm, 35mm equivalent), Multi point autofocus, Super Nightshot 0 Lux System, USB connectivity to your pc and many other bells and whistles, and you end up with a great tool that produces high quality pictures, video and sound at an affordable price. As for 'hideous looking purple flares' - one should keep in mind that backlighting distortion and white glare can easily be avoided with a polarized lense filter.  Most professional photographers would recommend using a polarized lense filter at high-altitude, on snow or water, or any combination of snow, water, high-altitude unless you are specifically looking for light distortion in your output.I would definitely recommend this product for the pro/recreational enthusiast who's looking for more than something that takes a digital snapshot without breaking the bank.

Carver", "ReviewID": "R341IAAYEBBG8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this camera extensively for field work, and I work for an engineering company.  I travel a lot so I lug this beast through airports and rental cars -- I would not do that if it wasn't worth it!This is the Swiss army knife of cameras.  Over the years I've owned it I've added the remote commander (release cable), a pocket tripod, external flash, and macro lense.  Also an extra battery (I sometimes shoot for hours in the field and take hundreds of photographs, so an extra battery is handy.)  But all this stuff (including the charger & manual) fits into a regular-sized SLR camera bag, so essentially I have a full studio in one little camera bag.  I've used the movie mode to shoot digital video of street conditions and traffic operations (I strapped it to a bicycle once to record bike commuting conditions) in addition to the still mode.  The camera works great for portaits, landscape shoots, long exposures, indoor photos of public meetings -- you name it, the camera can do it. Enlargements from 8 MP are better than anything I've ever gotten with 35 mm and I put them right up there with photos from my Rolleiflex medium format camera (I've had them both done for comparison, and they both looked great -- different from each other, but great.)Downsides?  Well, it is heavy, but I've tried using the tiny cameras as well and they just don't cut it for me.  I'm too spoiled by the infinite possiblities of this camera.Purple fringing -- not an issue.  I've seen it a few times, but it's never of any consequence.  I've also seen it on 35mm slr pictures -- I think it's an artifact of particular lighting conditions with particular lense settings.  Big whoop.High ISO Noise:  I only go above 100 ISO if I absolutely have to, and if I have to go above 200 ISO, I reset to 64 ISO and just use the flash.  The 400 and 800 ISO settings are about useless in my experience -- there is tons of noise.  You can clean the noise up, but when the noise to picture ratio is so high, I find that the cleaned pictures have a definite \"soft\" look to them.  That's going to be good occasionally, but not generally.  For very low-light situations without a flash, I prefer to revert to 400 ISO film.  This is the major shortcoming of this camera, in my opinion.Durability -- let's talk.  I've had the camera sent off for repair once, after about two years of very heavy use (including getting dumped out of a bag into the sand while working in a Katrina rebuild job, and being strapped to a bicycle :-)  The mode dial switch on top got squirrelly, and two screws worked loose and disappeared out of the lense barrel.  So I bought a slightly larger bag (to keep the mode dial from getting bumped in the bag), I routinely check the tension on the barrel screws (they get loose occasionally) and I'm more careful about where I leave the camera.  I consider the camera very resilient for the type of conditions I put it through.  Will it last 50 years like my Rolleiflex?  I doubt it.  Will it last longer than other digicams?  It's already outlived two of my wife's Nikons.  I think it's going to be around a while. I would not be surprised if the camera outlived the digital storage media available for it.What I love about it:  I love the completely silent operation -- great for candids and taking pictures during public meetings, photos at family events, etc.The rotating back is great for the same reason -- you can shoot and no one even realizes you're doing it.  I've really come to love waist level shooting.Complete manual control -- let's me do everything I can do with my K1000 (except for infinite bulb control.)Infrared mode -- produces neat infrared photos with a filter, that in turn make cool B&W; pictures.And the lense -- what's not to like about a HUGE Zeiss lens?  Manual zoom control -- yes, the only way, feels like a real camera and not a toy. And no annoying \"whirrr\" when I zoom in and out.I could go on, but those are my favorites.  This camera is as big as a horse, as far as digital cameras go, but it's a work horse, and it definitely pulls its weight.

It seems there is disagreement among reviewers here regarding the alleged chromatic aberration (purple fringing) issue.  The most thorough and objective online review site I know of for digital cameras is Digital Photography Review ([...]  As an aid to other consumers concerned about this issue, I offer the following quote from their review of this camera:\"It's a huge pity but the DSC-F828 has a fringing problem. We'll call it 'purple fringing' but it's clearly a combination of chromatic aberrations caused by the interaction of the lens and the microlenses on the sensor and enhanced by a certain amount of blooming which carries the color out further than the original artifact.While worse at full wide angle and maximum aperture (28 mm equiv., F2.0) it is visible throughout the zoom range and at smaller apertures. It's clearly possible to take images which will never suffer from this effect, it does require either a strong backlight or sunlight reflection to become apparent. The issue really is that in a normal shooting situation you would have no real idea if the image had suffered until you return to your computer and view the image at full size.It's also possible to reduce the visiblity of these artifacts with careful post-processing, using specific CA reduction tools or simple color replacement filters. However there is no getting away from the fact that these artifacts should not be there.\"I've viewed about a dozen sample photos that illustrate this aberration, and I agree with the above assessment.  Also, I was not at all impressed with the DSC-F828's noise level in low-light situations given this camera's price point.  There is a lot of potential in this model (8MP, Carl Zeiss lens, etc.), but at the end of the day, image quality is what matters most in a camera.  Sony has consistently upgraded this camera about every 12 months for the last four years (F505 - Aug '99; F505V - Apr '00; F707 - Aug '01; F717 - Sep '02; F828 - Aug '03).

But what does it mean by 8mpx? 8mpx doesn't mean anything when the CCD censor is small, and doesn't give you a good quality result. Nikon D70 uses 23.7 x 15.6 mm CCD sensor Canon 300D uses 22.7 x 15.1 mm CMOS sensor Sony F828 uses a 8.8 x 6.6 mm CCD sensor the sensor is like the negative in film camera. the smaller the sensor, gives you a poorer quality output and greater distortion on the output. In this case, Nikon D70 gives 6.1mpx vs Canon 300D 6.3mpx vs Sony F828 8mpx, D70 wins hands down on image quality. F828 uses a electronic Viewfinder (VF). In another word, the VF is laggy. Another problem with F828 is has a slow Autofocus (AF). Yes, it is faster than F717, but it is way too slow compare to D70/300D. With laggy VF and slow AF, at the moment when you fire, most likely the subject already no longer at the position.

And sure enough, once he knew what to look for, the CA was present in many photos.  There was even a photo (taken outside) of a salesman and a customer in front of a car that just had some installs.  At both points on the fender where the sun was reflecting - purple stars instead of the white ones you'd expect.I didn't really look into the noise problem.  I think Sony should try to improve the CA first.  ---Too many pixels on too small of a sensor.---Love the look, feel, and features.

Functional and attractive at the same time.", "Author": "Adrian", "ReviewID": "R7AUM5YLB6G2O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Sony f828 second hand 2 months ago for SGD$650, which is about USD$430ish. I fell in love with it the first time I held it when it first came out, but it was way too expensive. Now it is mine!The f828 has come down in price, yet it remains very competitive in terms of appearance, features and results.All this previous brouhaha about \"purple fringing\" and \"excessive graininess\" was, in technical jargon, a load of bulldust.Perhaps one of the reasons people had criticisms about it was it's high price. If it had been originally priced 35% cheaper, in line with it's other prosumer contemporaries, maybe it would have fared better reviewise. But then again, Sony has always priced itself higher than other brands.Back to the present though. I've taken about 150 shots and I find it is an immensely versatile camera.It takes two types of memory cards (I have a 1GB Compact Flash and 2 GB Sony Mem Stick Duo primed and loaded), it has a gorgeous lens which focuses mega fast and has a very useful zoom range from wide angle 28mm to 200mm. This is far more versatile than the f828 replacement, the R1. In addition, I love having shutter speed control, manual zoom and focus, manual flash and tilting the handgrip so you dont have to hold the LCD screen near your eyes like a dork.The photos arent bad either. Sony has always had excellent colour and this is no different. I admit that it is not as perfect as a dSLR (I had a Canon 350d prior to this. Pic quality was awesome) but since i rarely print photos, this is not an issue. I usually store pics on computer, burning them onto VCD as backup. If I want to share, I post them online. A lot more \"modern\" people do that than people realise. Not everyone wants to print hundreds of photos which are the size of an A4 sheet of paper.Are there any gripes?A larger LCD screen might be nicer, though I really have no problems with the 1.8 inch one provided. Current digi cameras all have 2.5 inch though.As one reviewer mentioned, it does get a bit heavy if you carry it around for hours on end.The instruction manual could use some improvement. There were a couple of times it would say something like \"press the blah blah button to use the blah blah feature\" without actually specifying where the button was, or how to find the controls for the feature.But overall I like the f828. At it's current second hand price, there is no digi camera which has it's features, and you have to pay a lot more to get superior features plus picture quality. The Panasonic FZ-50 has double the zoom range, but no wide angle and some people still think it has issues with grain. A dSLR with a useable 28-200mm lens costs triple or quadruple the price. (eg a Nikon dSLR with a Nikon 28-200mm lens)I hope some people find my opinion of some use :) Cheers!", "Date": "April 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "My First Real Camera!", "Author": "Walter F. Southard III \"prodiverwalt\"", "ReviewID": "RE0S0YVGBV5S2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started off, like most people, with a 35mm pocket camera.  The 35mm produced 2 or 3 pictures I could live with however, it takes more than an hour to see the results.  I changed to the 24mm Advantex system and was pleased with most of the photos shot, an hour or so later.I allways wanted a relly good camera and decided to up-grade to a digital.  I did not want to drop good money into the unknowen so, I started a month long reserch for the perfect camera for me.  I have read more than a hundred reviews from everywhere before it lead me to one model; Sony F828.  For the price, the Sony offers the widest range of functionality and versatility in its class.This is the first digital camera I have ever owned and it took no time for me to learn to use it well, but it did take work.  Most of the Sony features are right at your fingertips.  Other, less traveled features, are only an easy-to-read menu away.  Once you learn the menus and settings on the F828, you can use other Sony cameras (DSC P75,100,150)that have the same system.The Sony F828 has good video and ok sound, too.  I was going to buy a video camera from Sony next.  After useing The F828, I abandond the idea.  This camera is memory hungry in video mode if you want to shoot for any length of time.  The camera offers three video qulity levels; 160, 640 standard and 640 fine.  With a 512 memory stick,  I can shoot 22 minutes of video and sound on standard.  If set on 640 fine, the time is about 5 minutes.  I bought a 4GB Micro Drive and I am now able to shoot video past the battery life and thousnds of photos.A note about accessories:  Buy a good flash for when the need arises.  Do not wast your money on macro add ons or a telephoto doubler. I have thease items and am not happy.  The macro built onto the camera is excellent.  The built on 200mm zoom is great.  The 2x doubler lowers the qulity of the photo and confuses the auto focuse.  If you want a lense accessory, a wide angle lense is the better choice.Draw backs on the Sony F828:  It is not as mobile as my pocket camera and a bit heavy.  Unless you plan to blow up photos and need the advanced features this camera delivers, I would recomend another camera.  The Sony DSC P-100 or P-150 is a good start.  My second camera is a P-100 and it is out of this world.If you do deside on the F828, stand back, your in for a great photo experiance.  Remember this.

The beauty of this piece of equipment is that it kindles people like me who used a camera to record a holiday, birthday etc. to take it into the next level.  The package consists of more or less everything you need to start taking better pictures.Three months after the purchase, I have my own website, read about photography every day and completely absorbed by its adventures. I have bought the 1758 tele converter and the F32X flash unit as well.  I still haven't felt limited by the fixed lens or any other features.Including Compact Flash as well as the legendary memory stick trully brought this out of the usual \"Sony\" proprietary syndrome.One draw back is I don't believe that Sony is fully committed to serious photography equipment compared to Canon or Nikons of the world.  This looks like another money spinner that makes them smile.  So the committment for accessories, enhancements will always remain a question mark in my mind. The only other drawback is the time taken to write a raw file (12-15 seconds). A write cache would have made this the perfect camera in this league without costinng the consumer too much.

My first impressions were that the F828 is a great looking and solidly built camera that takes outstanding pictures. Shutter lag is extremely short such that it can catch the action before the action moves off the frame.  Recycle time between shots is very fast. Recommend getting the 12x CF card which is a big improvement over 4x, but not noticeably slower than the 40x.  Zoom range is more than adequate with a surprisingly good wide angle and good macro feature.  Battery life is excellent but since it's a proprietary battery, it would be a good idea to carry a spare.  As far as the storage media is concerned, Sony did right by having the F828 accept compact flash.  I find it useful to have both a 256MB CF card and 256MB memory stick pro loaded in the camera at the same time.  I can fill up my compact flash and switch to memory stick with a flick of a switch without missing a beat.  The built-in flash is fine for fill-in or close indoor shots, but I would highly recommend the Sony HVL-F32X flash.  It makes a huge difference and would be money worth spent.  I also expected faster shutter speeds from a camera that sports a fast Carl Zeiss lens.Leaving the exposure and aperture on automatic produces great resolution and color.  I did get caught up with being concerned about purple fringing and noise after reading dpreview. In a few photos, I did notice some purple fringing, but I really had to zoom in about 4x and look for it on my 17\" LCD.

At higher ISO settings, the noise levels are unnacceptable, especially when cameras like the Digital Rebel do so much better at high ISO with their CMOS chips.

Is compositional freedom important to me? if the answer is no then get this camera. If it's yes then don't because of the following reasons. First of all if you look past sony advertising.. the only thing F828 lens shares with a true 200mm is the angle of view. It does NOT have the same DOF as a true 200mm lens..(you think just because u got an apperture of 2.0 that u will make portraits with beautiful bokeh?? think again.. you will not! A 50mm lens gives u good background blurr only at very close focus at which the features of ur subject will be distorted.It does NOT compress perspective like a true 200mm lens. Which mean u cannot stack those hills.. You cannot push ur subject closer to those gorgeous mountains. You cannot compress a crowded traffic filled scene and make it seem dramatic. At best it will do normal perspective where nothing is dramatic. It does NOT have the same magnification as a true 200mm lens! And if those good marketing folks were replaced by engineers there would no such thing as 'digital zoom'. Advice: if a salesman tells you \"this has a 5X digital Zoom\" .. please please please prove you are not stupid by laughing in his face!  Additionally at the wide end.. it's a 7mm lens.. come on?? you don't expect distortion? go to [...] and see for yourself! Normal people call it 'Rule of thumb', engineers call it the 'The Bayer Imperitive'. Smaller the pixel size higher the noise. Pixels don't get any smaller than in the SONY. Nevermind that magic fourth color, the sensor produces unacceptable noise at all ISO's above 200. source: [...]What about the purple fringing?? I hope Carl Ziess bought sony dinner first! Don't belive me? go see [...] Before u commit to settling for the chromatic aberations resulting in the purple fringes, keep in mind that there is no filter in the world that will cure this completely because filters can only mask problems they can't alter lense geometry. If you are serious about photography and money is tight.. get an entry level DSLR from canon or Nikon. Conclusion:If I were to make a sony F828 out of my EOS 300D I would have to do the following: perminently superglue a fast 50 lens to the camera. (then slow it down because they are usually f1.8). Take a shot and crop the edges away in photoshop till I get about a 200mm field of view.(offcourse the sony does the exact same thing except the crop is much higher res because it is done by the senor that is way smaller than the image made but the lens). If my explaination is unclear then consier this.. take a 35mm film plate, take a pair of sissors and clip away the edges and make the film area about 25% of it's original size. Then make the film 4 times more dense. Then give the film a name like 'miracle film' that makes any lens 4 times more powerful. Then ask your self one question.. Will I buy this film if it were sold to me? Sony lens is 7-51mm.. sony marketing says 35-200mm (35mm equallent) Please see past the marketing.. demand to know the facts. Ask then to define equallent. Lastly, it uses an EVF: let's try an experiment.. I'll come to ur house and replace all the mirrors with tiny TV screens. It's a great idea becaue u can then see urself even in the dark. If you think you will like that.. they you will like the EVF idea too.. come on damnit! it's a 1000$ camera..If you are an SLR user and are thinking about buying a sony F828.. your decision is simple.. don't. If u are a newbee and this is ur first camera.. then buy it.. it's got killer features and u will make beautiful pictures never knowing what ur missing.got more question? don't agree? vik_wvu@hotmail.com", "Date": "February 26, 2004"}, {"Title": "almost perfect", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R9PEOV2VBQO8Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "great camera who's highlights have been well described here.only problems with some minor purple fringing.but how can such a high end camera not have black and white when sony's lower end cameras all have it???", "Date": "June 21, 2004"}, {"Title": "Nikon vs. Minolta vs. Canon vs. Sony, or d-SLR?", "Author": "Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"", "ReviewID": "RROH9MG6JS44B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, this isn't one of my usual hands-on reviews.

The purple fringing is bad but just annoying, filters clear it up easily and make the photos look better anyway. There is also a clarity problem with any light that is not out doors. Maybe its just my camera and if anyone else has this problem please say so, but shutter lag is horrible. The 717 was way better. And the buttons on the lens for Macro and bracketing can get in the way and accidentally pressed.On the positive side it has awesome features, and looks. The feel is solid and lens with the proper filters can take some awesome shots. The manual zoom is a step above the 717's button zoom. As well the features are better than the 717.I will keep this camera but plan on getting a Canon 10D as my pro shot taker when I want reliability and reduce this to the alternate.
