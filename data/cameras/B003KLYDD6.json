It was inexpensive, and the 12 megapixels was a great feature.  It is really great as a family picture-taker.  I've taken some really beautiful pictures of my kids with it.  But then someone needed me to start taking pictures of some things she wanted to sell, so she wanted them to be very true-to-life.  The colors are NEVER good enough for her.  There's always something \"off\" about the pictures I take.  I need to be very close to the items to get detailed shots, and usually that renders the flash unusable, since it washes the item out.  So I can never use the flash, and then the shutter speed slows down so that half the time, my pictures are blurry.  And here's something REALLY annoying: when I'm getting ready to take a picture, everything looks awesome in the LCD screen.  But then when I take the picture (without flash), all the colors are off, especially the whites.  They turn bluish.  If I'm using flash, this doesn't happen, but I can't use flash for reasons previously mentioned.  I've looked everywhere, and there doesn't appear to be a white balance setting on here, so that would explain that.Bottom Line: This is great for informal family pictures (the macro setting is actually quite useful too), but if you're trying to take an important picture, don't rely on this.  Get a DSLR.  That's what I'm doing.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great inexpensive camera", "Author": "Maurice A.
