I'm used to Canon, but when I saw the pics produced with this Nikon D7000, I was blown away.  I researched prices and packages for a long time.  I read all the reviews and finally decided on this DavisMax Advanced Bundle III.  It has everything I was looking for.  I'm still saving for a Nikon 55-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED VR AF-S DX Nikkor Zoom Lens and will most likely purchase that from DavisMax if they offer it.  Great bundle with great prices.  Everything as promised, thank you DavisMax!", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004LK47CM"}}
