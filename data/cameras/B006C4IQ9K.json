For 14 mega pixels and all the options, the zoom is not that great so in a sense for a budget camera it is well worth the money. I also use a tripod that I bought separately. The camera is compact has a good bright flash for dark photos it comes with 1. 5 volt alkaline batteries. However, I use rechargeable batteries. In all if you're just starting abroad with basic photography, this is a step higher than a point and shoot camera, the photos without zoom come out clear in the daylight and night. In a total for the money and photo quality, I give it five-star rating.", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.95", "Features": null, "Name": "GE X5 14 Megapixel 15x Wide Optical Zoom 2.7 TFT LCD - Midnight Blue [Electronics]", "ImgURL": "http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._V192198896_.gif", "ProductID": "B006C4IQ9K"}}
