{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R20OC9RE2CUAU9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For my first digital camera, this was a pretty big investment so I took my time reading all of the reviews and looking over all of the specs before committing to buying this camera.  First off, some items that might be worthwhile to mention.  Since the description of the product is so detailed, I thought I'd give a list of what is actually included in the box.Mx-2900 Camera, 8mb Smartmedia Card (3.3V), Rechargeable Lithium Ion Battery, AC adapter (you can plug it into the camera to charge the battery), Serial transfer cable for both PC and (what looks like) Mac, Video out cable (for displaing what's on the LCD to a TV), Lens Cap, Wrist Strap, CD of Software (image editing software and drivers to transfer images to the computer), manuals and etc.What it lacks is a carrying case and I have to admit, transfering images via serial cable is quite slow.  I haven't gotten so frustrated at the speed as to go buy a card reader, but to transfer a 640x480 image at highest compression takes about 7 seconds.  The 8 meg card fits 144 of those, so a full card can take a while.  The image quality is wonderful, I show my friends the pictures I've taken and they comment on how professional looking the pictures seem (colors are vibrant, images are sharp, 1800x1200 max resolution) and I am no professional photographer.  The zoom isn't great in terms of power (3x optical and 2.5x digital) but there is minimal distortion when using the optical zoom.  The flash is powerful enough for most uses but there is a hotshoe for the addition of an external flash.  As well as a lot of automatic features that let you point and shoot, there is a manual mode where you can adjust exposure, flash, white balance among other nifty features I am still playing with.  The case is sturdy and it feels comfortable in my hand, and it looks really nice compared to some of the other cameras on the market.  The battery life is great (for me), I've taken 70 pictures without flash or LCD and the battery had over half its life still left.  Overall, for a thrifty spender like me, I have no regrets spending $500 on this wonderful camera.", "Date": "October 11, 2000"}, {"Title": "The Best Camera I Have Ever Owned", "Author": "Donald E. Tebbs", "ReviewID": "R3OQ39E09NZ3KQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I buy anything, I do lots of research.  I did my homework on this camera and am greatly satisfied by the results.  I am amazed at all the useful features.  The 3X optical zoom and the 1800X1200 resolution of the pictures make it one of the few great cameras in its price range.  The ability to shoot pictures using the manual as well as the automatic mode, make it an excellent camera for the person who has been using traditional SLRs and wants to move into the digital age.  The quality of the color in the photos is brilliant and nearly exactly like natural colors.  When I print 8X10 photos, the pictures have sharp resolution.  I use a USB SmartMedia card reader.  I am able to download the pictures to my PC in literally seconds.  With a 32 meg. SmartMedia card, I can store 36 photos shooting at 1800X1200 resolution. This is my second digital still camera in two years and I am greatly satisfied with it.  I have recommended it to three friends who also now own the camera and love using it.", "Date": "December 3, 2000"}, {"Title": "Outstanding digital camera", "Author": "Chuck Hammock", "ReviewID": "RGSNT4W9LZGF8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my MX2900 for about 3 weeks now and I love it!  It's easy to use and takes great photos at high resolution and low resolution.  The optical zoom is great.  I can't believe how clear it is.  There aren't many camera's out there in this price range that have the features this camera packs.  One of the main things I like about it is all the manual options it gives you.  If you like to play with shutter speed and lighting, this camera is for you!  It also has great special effects built in too. The only downside I've noticed to this camera is the serial connection for downloading your pics.  This can be fixed by buying a USB card reader.  It would have been nice if they had thrown in a 16mb smartcard too.  Don't let these little problems keep you away from this camera.All in all, I'd say I'm a very satisfied Fuji owner.", "Date": "October 22, 2000"}, {"Title": "Fuji has a Winner here..!!", "Author": "Neeraj Jain \"NJ\"", "ReviewID": "R1JN98LRT47O7K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Being a stickler for value, flexibility, operating costs, and above all appearance and ease, I admit this camera has it all. My first digital camera, carefully selected after months of research on C/net, auction sites, consumer reviews, amazon reviews, I am so happy that I chose the Fuji MX 2900. I have seen cameras from Olympus and Sony, but they couldn't come up to my expectations. The three reasons why I concluded with a 4-star rating is: 1) The lens cap w/strap is a bad idea. It really is a problem putting it back on the lens after you have switched off the power. 2) The LCD screen is quite dim when composing shots. However, the actual shots are amazingly clear. 3) The Serial port is S L O W. Buy a SanDisk USB card reader for under $40 from anywhere.By the way, the included 8MB Card is good enough for an occasional photographer. It can take 141 standard, 89 normal, 17 Fine, and 2 Hi quality shots. I took 17 fine shots at the fist go and they are incredible for potraits. Now, I am sticking to normal quality.Also, the in-built flash is sufficient for most purposes, and I don't agree investing in an external flash unit at this time.I am still experimenting with the manual operation. So far I am already amazed with the Auto mode.Finally, the quality of color reproduction is probably the best in class. Way to go...FUJI.!!", "Date": "January 10, 2001"}, {"Title": "Good camera, great price!", "Author": "R. Mok", "ReviewID": "R2EMUG7FA3U918", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second digital camera. I bought it because it has a lot of manual controls that my first camera, Agfa CL50, doesn't have. Fuji introduced this canera near the end of 1999 so its price has dropped quite a bit since then. I really like its design. The hand grid and the solid metal feel make it so comfortable in my hand. Built in hot shoe is a big plus that I can attach an external flash light. It has a 2.4 mega pixels CCD which is more than enough for my use. Image quality is good and nicely exposed. It has a full control of all shutter speeds but only two settings for aperture (4 and 8) which is the only thing I disappointed. And that's why I give it a four instead of five stars. Anyway it is a very nicely built camera in a very attractive price. All control buttons are in good positions. Oh, lastly the rechargeable battery last for quite a while after a full charge. Except it is quite pricy!", "Date": "March 17, 2001"}, {"Title": "Takes a lickin & keeps on clickin", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RQVN4EDVQQQIB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera was knocked out of my son's hand by a ceiling fan onto our basement floor, fell out of my shirt pocket onto a concrete sidewalk  outside the National Cathedral in DC, and has otherwise been bumped, dropped, and generally mistreated for going on two years, and it still takes pictures -- that with the right printer, paper, and software -- I can blow up all the way to 11X14 inches with true photo quality.  There isn't enough good I can say about this camera. Of course, it's no longer a current model, but at the prices available today -- and assuming you use a card reader of some kind to download pictures from the smart media cards -- it's still a great camera for the money.", "Date": "December 8, 2002"}, {"Title": "Excellent  Hardware, less than excellent software", "Author": "George E Creel", "ReviewID": "R223AX33NZ5EQ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the camera.  The zoom works easily and the optical viewfinder means I never have the battery run down during a day of shooting.  But...Fuji uses an odd TIFF file system when taking umcompressed photos and regular software won't read the file.  You have to use the Fuji software and convert the file to JPEG.  Their software is not user-friendly.  Fortunately, I rarely take TIFF images.  The JPEG images at the 1 megabyte level are fine for anything but portrait work.  Excellent construciton and excellent color rendition. I've used the camera for a year and will soon upgrade to a 5 megapixel unit, keeping this as a second camera.  One really irritating thing:  The \"close-up\" setting does not go back to default when the camera is turned off, which can ruin a lot of pictures if you're not careful to turn the \"close-up\" off when done taking close-ups.With that exception, the controls are easy to operate and the camera has served me well.", "Date": "December 24, 2001"}, {"Title": "My  fantastic Fuji MX2900 Digital Camera", "Author": "\"mandalke\"", "ReviewID": "R2GUFRYJX0CW06", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Dear Fuji !First I would like to say , that the MX2900 has been a great camera at a great price for me . I purchased one... for myself and my job.  I am currently the Internet Manager for Mancari's Chrysler Plymouh Jeep in Oak Lawn IL . I have used the camera for taking auto photos and many other different projects. The Fuji MX2900 Digital Camera is extremely  easy to setup and use altogether . It has a very nice \"Chrome metal\" look and is also very lightweight. The pictures it takes are excellent !...Even though I know there may be better cameras out there , I still rate this one a 10 in my book of Best Cameras.

I use a hp1000 printer with it and only hp premium plus glossy or matte paper. The pictures are magnificent, I have printed some of my pictures for comparison on much more expensive printers none so far have been better than mine.The only thing I have against it,is that it didn't come with a leather carrying case.
