( even the HP home site couldn't compare with Amazon's deal + free shipping )and overall it seemed pretty idiot proof... ( I am completely challenged when it comes to electronics ) When I got it I was so excited to try it out...I took it to my daughter's dance watch night and with the video feature recorded her dance numbers ( with the extra SD memory card I bought ) It was very easy to upload the video and pictures I took onto the computer using the software it came with...I even figured out how to email all of it to out of town realatives without being reduced to tears! I would absolutely buy this camera again and would recommend it to anyone, the only suggestion that I have would be to get either a set of good rechargable batteries or lithium ion batteries...they may cost more now but they are well worth it...also, investing in an extra memory card or two is probably a good idea if you plan to use your camera a lot...I got a 2GB memory card on Amazon for $5 !! You won't find a better deal then that anywhere !!", "Date": "February 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera for the Price!", "Author": "C. Briggs \"Cindyssmilin\"", "ReviewID": "R1UAHITTJDCCQI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great. I am a huge HP Camera fan. This is my 3rd one (I upgrade every 3 Megapixels once they go on sale). It is easy to use and makes beautiful pictures.I am a picture a holic. I constantly take pics of my niece and nephews. This camera has held up with the excessive use and pics are as beautiful now as before. The different shoot modes allow you to get just the right lighting and exposure for any situation. The fact that you can edit the photos directly in the camera is great. Especially if you are using one of the gogo HP printers.The manual recommends lithium batteries and they work the best. I got about 4 hours of heavy picture taking out of the alkaline and about 7 out of rechargable. The lithium last about 3 days of very heavy picture taking.I would recommend this camera to anyone. It has been nothing but a pleasure for me.", "Date": "February 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Takes great pictures", "Author": "intanet", "ReviewID": "R2MZK24TJDUA95", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Camera takes beautiful pictures.  Crisp and clear.  The automatic lighting feature is great.  I took pictures in my living room at night and they were clear and bright. But with the 16mb internal memory, if you have the settings to good quality photo taking (8mp), it can only hold a few photos in memory (8 pictures I think).  I also got the camera for the video feature.  Problem was, it can only take a 13 second video with the 16 mb of internal memory.  Had to get a card.  Luckily, they were on sale too so I got a 4GB card the next day.  Now I can take 51 minutes of video. And the sound was very surprising.  Of course the camera doesn't have speakers so you can't hear the sound till you upload the video to your PC. And I can store over 1000 pictures now.Never had a digital camera before.  I guess there's no getting around the lithium batteries cause the alkaline batteries they provided to get you started only lasted for about 6 hours. HP tech told me the zoom feature eats up a lot.  Anyhow, takes great pictures.", "Date": "November 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Least Durable Camera Out There", "Author": "J. Kuhn", "ReviewID": "R2MRQJBSC2QBUX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this camera for Christmas.  We found it took nice pictures and was easy to use; however, it has a major design flaw.  The memory card slot is inside the battery compartment which is extremely difficult to open and easily broken.  Within 10 days the battery compartment door was broken because those little tabs that hold it closed are tiny and weak.  HP replaced the camera.  Now the new camera has the same problem and now a new problem.  Another tab holding the battery compartment has broken.  It's a different one from the one that broke on the first camera but they are all made the same; tiny and too weak to withstand the regular opening required to retrieve the memory card.  The new problem is that the slot that holds the memory card will no longer release the card.  When you push down on it, it is suppose to pop up; it doesn't.  The camera has suffered no abuse beyond regular, responsible use.  I would not recommend buying this camera no matter what the cost.Editted:  It has been almost a year since I bought the original camera and less than 8 months since I received the second replacement.  The second replacement is now broken.  Again, the tabs in the memory card/battery compartment the hold the door closed have broken off.  Two of the tabs are broken this time.", "Date": "February 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not happy with Gamzi Digital", "Author": "Lied To.", "ReviewID": "R3TH7FN7ZUH71N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Only problem was it didn't come in the original box or with manual after salesman told me it was still in the box.

Fair or not, here are my impressions.The good:  It really took some great pictures.  Also for a camera that takes AA batteries it has a small form factor almost in the subcompact category.  Delete button is handy for deleting unwanted pictures.  Flash button is handy for turning flash on/off or to red-eye flash.  Cool Panorama feature although you might need a tripod for it to really work seamlessly.  Menus are straightforward.The bad:  Battery compartment door is hard to shut and it feels like it would break over time.  The tiny slider that switches from camera to movie mode to display mode is flimsy and clumsy to use especially if you want to stop in movie mode.  Movie mode is only 320x240 at 24fps.  Limited options.  Flash recharge time is long.  Sometimes focuses on things other than your subject.  Size.  IT's not big, but not as nice and sexy as a true subcompact.the ugly:  The USB port is on the bottom of the camera which means you either have to lay the camera on its front or back when hooking the camera up to your pc.  In other words you get to choose whether you would like to scratch the front of your camera or the back.  (Ok you can buy a tiny soft pillow to lay your camera on.)  The lcd display gets a nod here as well. It's just not that good.  It doesn't do a good job of communicating whether or not you took a great photo.  I felt the Canons that I previously used were much better in this regard.  And another annoying thing was the camera seems to take a picture a half-second after you want it to even if you halfway hold down the shutter button to charge up the flash.  It's also not a winner in the looks department.  IT looks clunky.  Last the zoom is not that good.  The buttons don't feel that great and the zoom sorta \"skips\" rather than zooms in/out.All in all this camera is a great value if you want pictures equal to the top point and shoot cameras and you want AA batteries and yet are willing to put up with its clunkiness.  To be fair I am used to Canon cameras and so some of the clunkiness may be interpreted (perhaps) as just \"not Canon.\"For $93 now it's hard to beat in terms of money spent to get a great picture.  Still I decided to return it and get a Canon SD1000is instead.  IN a few weeks I'll see if it was worth it.", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "I hate it", "Author": "Margie", "ReviewID": "R37HV2UBGIHXJA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was waiting and waiting for the camera.

They expect you to download the manual, at your own time and expense, from their web site.  All they provide with the camera is a Quick Start Guide and a detailed warranty. Also the place where you connect the USB cable to transer pictures to your PC is at the bottom of the camera.  I usually take pictures with a tripod which means I always have to remove the camera from the tripod to transfer pictures.  Badly designed feature.  The software that comes with the camera may or may not be current and therefore may or may not work!THE UGLY:  This best describes the experience you may have dealing with HP tech support.  I called their tech support TWICE BEFORE i BOUGHT THE CAMERA AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND SPOKE TO 2 DIFFERENT TECHS ABOUT HOW THE SELF-TIME WORKS.  I use the self-timer all the time and it works differently in various cameras.  Both techs told me it did NOT need to be reset for each picture as long as you didn't shut the camera off after setting it.  NOT TRUE!  I don't they intentionally lied to me.  I don't think they knew the right answer and didn't bother to look it up. But things went downhill from here.  There is supposed to be editing features in the software that comes with the camera.  All I wanted to do is crop the pictures I take.  When I couldn't find this feature in the software I called tech support.  THEY REFUSED TO HELP ME!  They said I had to look the information I needed up in their online user manual and figure it out myself.  To say I was furious is the understatement of the year, especially after I looked it up in the user manual only to find out the manual DOES NOT EVEN COVER THIS SUBJECT!!!  I called tech support back and asked to speak to a supervisor threatening to return the camera to Amazon and put a scathing review on Amazon's web site for all the world to see about HP's lack of customer service.  Fortunately a kind, knowledgeable, helpful tech from India took my call and agreed to help me.  He showed me how to access the program on the software but after cropping a few pictures, we had trouble saving them.  He determined I didn't have the most current version of their software and he showed me how to download the one I needed from their web site.  This solved the problem.  I later brought my experience to the attention of a supervisor, who listened patiently, but told me he couldn't do anything about it, including discipling the tech who refused to help me.  While it's tempting to return the camera and tell HP to go to hell, I've tried a Canon, a Nikon and a Panasonic digital camera in this price range only to find they were all defective in some way and had to be returned.  I was beginning to think I couldn't even find a camera that actually worked, much less one that took good pictures. The picture quality is out-standing on this camera.  I gave it only a 3-star rating because of the Bad and Ugly points mentioned.  BE FOREWARNED!  HP is going out of the camera business.  Maybe that's why they don't seem to care about helping their camera customers.  But I honestly think I'd get the same crummy customer service on any HP product so I won't buy another one. If you buy this camera and need tech support, pray you get the same kind, helpful tech I finally did.  I have a feeling he was one in a million which are not good odds, but you may get lucky.
