I thenI watched a You Tube video about changing this screen and ordered this replacement, not that expensive, not that difficult to change (took me two tries but that's not bad.  Turned out great, I'm back to taking pictures for less than ten dollars!", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Glad to find this Replacement Screen", "Author": "Daniel Bowman", "ReviewID": "R2L6Q5KEI5Q20I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This replacement LCD screen is working very well and was fairly easy to replace.

It never came.  Three weeks later they refund my money.  So I decide to buy one from TopBang.  It came within days very nicely boxed.  I removed 7 screws, popped off the back and replaced the screen.  It wouldnt light up at first...I hadnt pushed the connector all the way in.  After reinstalling it, it lit right up!  Fit perfectly from the git-go.  Highly recommended.  All you need is a jeweler's phillips screwdriver.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009GSYCE2"}}
