Although it is not a perfect camera, it's a good everyday camera.Pros:  Battery Life - It's much longer than expected.  Went two weeks without charging once.  It appears that Casio's claim of 300 shots per charge is accurate.Picture quality without flash - given the size, indoor pictures without flash comes out pretty good.Size - no need to say more.  Even with a case, the camera can be carried anywhere.Quick Camera Response - the camera is ready to use as soon as the 'on' button is pushed.  Shutter lag time is minimal as well.  A great camera to capture 'at the moment' pictures.Good features - over 20 preset special features including portrait, macro, night shots, etc.USB Cradle - Very convenient.  It charges, downloads and used for viewing pictures.  It retails for $50 but it was included.Looks - Best looking camera on the market.  Much better looking than Canon SD550 or Nikon S5.Cons:The camera did not respond when on button was pushed for a couple of hours.  Thought about returning the unit, but since then it has been fine.  Still cannot figure out what the problem was.No case was included.  Had to purchase one for $30 (although I'm totally happy with the case).Macro Picture Quality - picture quality when taken up close is mediocre.CD Manual - It's inconvenient as I have to pop in the CD.  Although a print manual comes with it, it only covers basic on/off operations.  All detail features are covered in the CD manual.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.  I mainly use the camera to take my son's pictures and the quick response has been the biggest plus as he moves around constantly.  I certainly recommend the camera.", "Date": "April 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Brian Lord", "ReviewID": "R3SC6GEJKE9P48", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first digital camera was a great camera-an Olympus D-500, but it got left out in the rain, and alas, it died, wet and soggy...This camera is excellent, I have been impressed with its digital zoom, its screen, and its ease of use... Its digital zoom is so good, that, look at the picture I uploaded to the customer images page, I can zoom in on a book with small print from 5 feet away and read the page. THis is good enough that I no longer have to pay for copies at my school. Yes, like the previous reviewer said, the screen does get fuzzy if you zoom in, but, I wonder if he/she actually purchased the camera, when you take that picture, it clears right up, even on the camera's little screen you have a perfectly clear image...and the screen is good enough that I can read that page in the book easily with out straining my eyes.I especially like that you can half-press the camera button, and a little square on the screen will light red or green, if its green, that picture will be be perfect everytime, with no blurryness at all...Now the camera can be a little picky as to what it thinks is a good or bad picture, but even if the square doesn't turn green, you're still likely to have a good picture, I've found, but when that square is green, you can jiggle the camera and still take a clear picture. I have noticed that this camera tends towards red-eye, but most small cameras have this problem, it has to do with the small lense, any (most of the time free) photo software can solve this easily, and the camera itself does a pretty good job also...", "Date": "April 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good for people on the go", "Author": "jack", "ReviewID": "R38VC0Y90T4YQZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Casio Exilim s600 is my first digital camera, and I think it's great. Although the LCD screen may only be over 80,000 mpxls, it works for me. The real selling point for me was how compact it is. This camera really can fit into your pocket, although I do have to periodically check on it to make sure I didn't press the 'on' button, which would make the lense protrude.Pros:-VERY small-->about half an inch thick.-nice 2.2 inch LCD screen-good picture quality, (see cons)-easy to use buttons conveniently placed-I didn't have to read the manual to figure out how to work it-the video feature can carry up to 2 hours of good footage-the 'best shot' features are nice. (e.g. sports, night scene, flower, text, portrait)-won't scratch-takes pictures very quickly-has a certain 'wow' factor that gets you a lot of attention.Cons:-might feel like you are going to drop it-the lense sticks out (unlike the sony cybershot)-no viewfinder..but you wouldn't need it anyways.-you need a 1gb of storage if you want to fit a lot of photos+video-pictures don't turn out very sharp-I'm personally not too keen on the software they give you [photoloader, photohands]-pricy for a point and shootThat's just my opinion; hopefully you can draw your own conclusion based on this and other reviews.

We loved it. Then the ring around the lens popped off after simply turning it on; it could not be reattached. The machinery inside was exposed. Casio took it back since it was under warranty, but, after we sent it to them, we were told that the lens ring was not covered. Even with their warranty in hand that stated everything (excluding the battery and power cord I believe) is covered, Casio insisted we pay nearly $200. In addition, we have been waiting 2 months to get the camera back (we still don't have it). We're so very frustrated. I would pursue them legally if I could justify the expense and effort.

This new one is a little bit bigger and the screen sticks out a bit, but the improved image quality at 6 megapixels and inclusion of a 3x zoom more than make up for it.  Realizing that there are limitations to the form factor, the picture quality is very good. I also have a larger Nikon SLR, which produces a better picture, but I have found that I would rather take the Exilim with me.  I can just stick it in my pocket, instead of having to drag a camera bag with me everywhere I go.  I also found that the improved video function to be another bonus, don't need to lug a separate video camera around, and the quality was surprisingly good compared to previous models.The only negative is that it takes a bit longer to start up, especially when you need the flash.  And the delay for the flash meant missing a couple of shots.

For example, you can only manually drop the ISO to 800 speed- but in the Best Shot Indoor dim light mode the ISO goes past 1000 (I forget exactly what)- why can't I set the camera to that manually??The Best Shot auto mode also does weird things, which somehow take very good photos-- for example the camera seems to love ISO 100- even indoors and in indirect light...I would think 400 would be a standard setting?  Whatever it does w/ the color balance, etc. seems to work though, as the pics still come out nice.I also dont get why I can't take non-blurry pics w/ faster shutter and film speeds manually even while using the same settings that the Best Shot mode does...unless I set the camera to Best Shot Sports mode, which adjusts everything for you.One more thing- this camera is hard to keep stable due to its small size..tough taking non-blurry pics in dim light sometimes.Do I wish this camera was more flexible?  Yeah, but thats a lot to ask for somethign this tiny and for under $300... overall a great all-around camera that you will actually take with you!", "Date": "July 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "A Great Camera with a few drawbacks...", "Author": "Z.

My old camera however was about the size of a brick. This one on the other hand, fits very easily in my pocket and I take it everywhere with me. After changing some settings around I have gotten the camera to take better pictures. If you want a camera with lots of features that is conveinient to carry, this is the camera for you.

I was hesitating between a canon (SD450) and this casio. The SD450 has an optical view finder and is supposed to have better picture quality. The casio is supposed to have a much better battery life, mpeg 4 video and image stabilisation.  After playing with them, I found that the optical viewfinder is hard to use on these tiny cameras and that the LCD of the casio ex-s600 is good even in full sun light so the optical viewfinder which I thought would be a deal breaker was now a moot point.The movies that I shoot with the ex-600 are good quality (but not as good as my mini-DV camcorder which isn't a surprise at all).  If I go somewhere and don't want to lug a camcorder, I won't hesitate to use the casio and since it's all encoded in mpeg4, I can fit an hour of video per 1GB SD card as opposed to 8 min of video per GB on the other cameras such as the canon SD450.  While I'd never record as much movie on a single card, what it means is that I can film as uch as I want and still have room for pictures.Indoor picture quality is not as good as my G2 (as expected) but based on what I've seen, the Canon SD450 wouldn't have been better.  The flash works well, the menus and buttons are intuitive.

The size is its killer feature--i take it with me everywhere--but it does really well with shutter lag too.  Actually, that's why I bought it.  My prior cameras (a cannon and a kodak) would constantly miss the action ( a  kid's smile, a great play at the plate, etc.) because of shutter lag. I did a ton of research on this (and even had a member of US Congress recommend it to me) and I find it great at capturing the action.  The movie feature has been terrific too, great quality for blogs and email.One downside is the PC software was completely useless for getting the pictures off the camera, but i just take the SD card out and pop it into my computer and it works great.", "Date": "June 14, 2006"}, {"Title": "Small price, Small camera, but huge return - highly satisfied", "Author": "STZ", "ReviewID": "R3CDEDIUREAP0I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used Casio Databank watches for long time now and I know how good quality they are. So I thought I try Casio camera because they looked slim, small, and good. I was pleasantly surprised. It is of exceptional quality, very easy to learn, slim, small, and very easy to use. I had got it last year but never used it. So last weekend, I pull it from package. It took me less than an hour to read the booklet. I took hundreds of pictures. All of them, using the highest pixel resolution mode. Each picture (.jpg file) turned out to be around 3.5 MB in size which is very good. I used an SD card of 2 GB. This allows you to take over 1000 picture of highest resolution. I have not used the software that comes with it and allows you to download pictures. I simply pulled the SD card from the camera, put the SD card in an adapter and put it in my computer's USB port. Then simply cut and pasted the files into my computer's hard disk. I could take pictures repeatedly (like every few seconds) and the flash would work every time. A few of pictures turned out to be a little darker than I expected but I think that is because of my lack of experience/knowledge of the camera. I really love this camera and highly recommend it.

Hudson \"Fatherhonda\"", "ReviewID": "R1RYF953H9YQ4K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned several digital cameras.  This Casio EXS600 is my eighth, and it is the most useful one so far.  It isn't just that the camera is small, so that I can carry it around all the time.  Picture quality is excellent, with sharp images and rich but not unrealistic saturation.  The video mode is efficient, producing artifact-free (as far as I can see) videos in relatively little card space (my two Canon cameras yield video of equal quality but use four times as much memory space).  The anti-shake feature, while it may not be the best technology (they move the CCD instead of variably bending light in the lens), seems to work.  I've gotten hand-held overhead shots in low-light at 1/40 of a second that were quite sharp.  There is also an ISO 1600 setting for extreme situations, but results are grainy.  Battery life is excellent -- I have taken as many as 150 pictures and several videos in a day and have never seen the indicator fall below 3 bars (out of 3).  I like the \"past movie\" mode, with which you can set it to take videos continuously but keep only the last 8 seconds of activity that occurred before you pressed the button to begin.  I know this sounds confusing, but here is an example.  I pointed the camara at a rooster and waited for it to crow -- after it did I pressed the movie button to turn the video mode on.  When I viewed the video it turned out that I had captured the full crow.  This mode is also useful for capturing something that my grandchildren are doing sporadically.There are a few downsides.  The cradle is fine for home use but not for travelling.  When travelling I use a card reader to feed photos to my laptop and an aftermarket battery charger to charge the battery (Amazon lists many chargers, some that come with spare batteries, for the NP-20 battery).  The camera has an instant-on feature that was annoying -- it would turn on in my pocket when the button was pressed lightly accidentally.  But it was a menu-selectable item and I turned it off.  The flash takes a few seconds to recharge for the next photo when you've taken a photo that demanded full flash energy (a distant subject), and it won't let you switch to viewing photos while that is going on.  But the flash is stronger than the ones on my Canon cameras.Overall, the negatives are minor.  This is a great camera.  You might be able to find it at a reduced price -- the Casio web site no longer lists information on it, which suggests they are phasing it out.UPDATE July 5, 2007.  The LCD screen failed on June 21.  The top half would not display an image.  I sent the camera to Casio's designated west-coast repair shop and was told I'd have to pay $140 to have it repaired!  They claimed the LCD screen failed because I had exerted undue pressure on it.  Maybe they're right.  I had kept it in a lower pocket of my cargo pants, not in a rigid case.  Part of the charm of a slim camera is that you can have it with you all the time, pull it out quickly, and use it to capture a photo op.  But I've kept a Canon SD400 in the same pocket for years with no problem -- so the Casio, with its larger screen, is apparently more fragile.  But $140 to repair it!  New ones are now selling on Amazon for $180.  I called Casio's customer service and found someone who agreed that $140 is excessive.  She called the repair shop and got the price down to $98 (including tax and shipping).  More reasonable, though if I had known the camera was this fragile I think would have looked for a more robust brand.", "Date": "May 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Quick reacting camera", "Author": "Just a guy", "ReviewID": "RK886Y0ZI98WM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update - I had some problems with the lcd display recently.

I've used it on 6 bike trips and 2 snowy trips in the Alps and all over the USA and have put thousands of shots and hours of videos through it. But I've never lost it or dropped it. How possible? When I bought it I attached a neck cord and have ALWAYS carried it around my neck (except on airplanes, where it lives in it's little leather case inside my camera bag). If it's not around your neck, you WILL drop it. If you carry it in your pocket, it WILL break. Same with any such camera. If I hand it to someone to take a shot, I put it around their neck. EVERYONE should get a neck cord for their tiny digital cameras and USE them. No worries after that. Here's a good cord on Amazon: Targus Digital TGK-NS Digital Camera Neck StrapThe paint is chipped all over now, and the lens cover doesn't open all the way until you tap it (this warpage happened recently in Vegas when I left it in my car for a day, and the car temperature probably reached well over 150 degrees - it was 110 outside - try not to do this!). But the camera still works!The only negative I've ever had with this camera is that you cannot zoom during video mode.  You must set the zoom where you want it BEFORE you start the video.I'm sorry that some folks have had quality control issues with this model.  But if you get a good one and wear it around your neck at all times, you are gonna love it.  I am very surprised (happily) that this older model is still available, but from what I read about the newer models, it is in many ways preferable, as Casio seems to be cheapening its products to stay competitive.PS...I carry my cellphone on a neck cord too, and it's over 7 years old (Sanyo on Sprint) and still works like new . . . never lost, never dropped, never broken.

Because of its price (especially the one I bought it for), a golden opportunity.If you find it around at an offer, since there are Exilims around at 12 Mpixels already, get it with confidence.", "Date": "August 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "prefect", "Author": "jk \"jk\"", "ReviewID": "R191P9EH0OB5DW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love this camera..its small and fits right in  your pocket the pictures turn out good and everything about it works wonderfully!", "Date": "August 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Poor warranty coverage", "Author": "David C.

I read the review about this issue.I will say, however, that my own experience with this camera, and a 2 GB memory chip, both purchased online, has been stellar. I've had my camera for about 18 months. As far as family photos, it has changed my life. I learned to make movies from the video clips, and now I'm the official family movie maker. I have never run out of memory with the 2 GB chip. I record all day long and then upload it to my computer and then reformat my camera disk to erase everything and start all over again.  I absolutely love this camera. It is tiny, light, convenient etc.  I am, however, extremely careful with it. I won't let anyone hold it unless they first put their hand through the wrist strap. I don't want it dropped because I had read a review before I purchased it that it damaged the viewer. However, I admit I did drop it once or twice, even with being so careful. There is no damage and it works beautifully. I have never printed pictures from it, but I have made at least 50 DVDs from the video clips.  It's my new hobby -- videotaping the grandkids, and the family members, especially those who live far distances, absolutely love receiving them. The kids, too, love seeing their trips et al on DVDs. So I have only fantastic reviews of this camera. I will be buying my daughter-in-law one for her birthday this year. I noticed that in 18 months the price of the camera has come down from about $400 to $200 and the memory chip from about $100 to $30.  What a deal.  I'm a huge fan of Amazon.com and purchase stuff regularly. I've never had any problem. I do still think, however, that it's riskier buying on line.
