Im a profesional photographer and i like to have a nice and portable camera \"just in case\", and i found this camera ( i had first the 12 megapixel fx100) almost perfect. wonderfull design and remarcable results. everybody knows about noise in this cameras over 400 iso. ALL THE CAMERAS in this range have the same limitation about noise;the small size of the sensor and the \"race\" of megapixels make this. You can bet that the next step in this class of cameras (2009 generation) will be increase the size of the sensor. So you should consider the differences between them. Color rendition of the panasonic: beautifull...quality lens.. leica,and deserves the name.  video in hd.. love it.. options of settings: a lot... construccion: excelent... easy of use control.. cant beat it, and... RAW format.. oh yes!! the first one in this range with this privilege. if you consider what are you buying (and what for) and how much are you paying (!!) i recomend this camera with out reservations.Update. Well i still recomend this camera but... with reservations. After some time and many pics i must agree about the noise. More than usual and more than the previous model fx100.

It has a few nice options, one which I particularly like is the SCN mode for low light portraits. It has a delayed double flash which allows you to balance ambient light with the flash for a more pleasing look. The one dissapointment I've been able to discern is its low light capabilities. Anything past iso 400 is virtually useless on this camera. The noise is so pronounced I would steer clear of anything higher than iso 200 if you want to print larger than 8x10. Other than that it should suit my needs. I would not consider this any kind of replacement for a good digital SLR but if you happen to need something small and discreet which allows you to enlarge you pictures beyond 8 x 10 this should fit the bill.", "Date": "September 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Features, Size and Quality in 1 pacakge", "Author": "Kurt @ TNMS", "ReviewID": "R25J5DJ2GQ74CH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a full review on my website: [...]To sum it up really fast:  This portable point and shoot camera has a lot of features, even I was impressed.

Davis", "ReviewID": "R2POPTCTTHXHE3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera has the capability to be a legend. The lens is tack sharp (besides the fact that it only has two aperture settings), and pictures look great in the day time. The auto white balance performance is better than my LX3, and the RAW capability is very cool (now with support in Adobe Photoshop Raw!). The 720/24p video is more than excellent, although it would have been nicer if it were H.264 video. The camera looks great in silver (it is actually a bit of a gunmetal color).That's where the good ends.You can see noise even at the lowest ISO setting, and chroma noise renders even ISO 800 images unusable for anything except thumbnails. Before you solely blame the minuscule sensor, remember that Ricoh Caplios have a smaller size sensor that they have been packing more pixels on for a few years now. The high ISO output from a Ricoh Caplio may be lacking in detail, but it doesn't have awful chroma noise infecting every inch of your photograph. Yes, I know the Caplios top out at 10 megapixels, and this camera tosses 15 insane megapixels, but still the density on the Caplio R10 is nearly identical! There's no reason the FX150 should be so underperforming.The RAW capability is nice to have. However, Panasonic saw it fit to make sure you can't EV bracket in raw. Speaking of bracketing, you can't do +2 and -2 EV bracketing either, which I feel shames both the FX150 and the LX3 (and I'm not the only one who feels this way). Another issue with RAW is that the dynamic range of the camera is so narrow that it really doesn't matter that it is there.This camera could have been a classic, and I really want to like it.

But as the PhotoGuru, I needed to keep my street cred, so I began the search.When I saw Panasonic's Lumix DMC-FX150, 14.7 megapixel compact camera about the same size of my Sony (possibly a tiny bit smaller at 2.12'' x 3.8'' x .98'') my mind said \"dope!\" and my late 90s lingo said \"no you di-ent!\". It's almost the size of a business card, just under an inch thick (non-chunky-style), and weighing in just over 5 ounces. Wow.It wasn't easy to find one in stock, but after searching the web, and making a few calls (with pain-in-the-rear reps tryin' to fake the \"in-stock\" sales pitch), Amazon.com's third party company provided me with one in stock (even Panasonic currently lists the camera as \"backordered\").I'm still getting to know my new little friend, just having it for less than a month, but I'm diggin' the RAW capability (that's right, RAW files, rarely seen in point & shoot cameras today), the massive 14.7 MPs (sure it's packed into a small 1/1.72\" CCD image sensor, but what would anyone expect for the great price and compact size?), as well as all of the quick menu options (giving me the ability to change flash option, ISO, as well as other features on the fly).For some reason, the auto rotate function isn't working, so I have to rotate any vertical shots to review them larger, taking up the entire 2.7\" LCD screen (hope to fix that or figure out why), but in general I'm very pleased with this compact beauty - the sleek black body very stylish and functional (I like to roll GQ style).I also feel the f/2.8 wide-angle Leica mass-produced lens (28mm to 100mm) is of quality, and I dig the new auto-focus tracking feature (focusing for you without touching the shutter button).The 8 GB SDHC memory card (I picked up after the fact - made by SanDisk) gives me over 300 images on the highest file size (RAW + JPEG, which is what I use on my 35mm DSLR)- more than enough as long as I download every so often (which is best to do anyway since you never want to trust your memory card to store your memories for too long). Plus, with the Lithium-ion rechargeable battery draining down after 330 snaps, I simply recharge the battery while I download the shots (hoping to pick up an extra battery as a backup). The camera even has 50MB of built in memory if you jam up with an extra card- thanks for caring Panasonic.The Lumix DMC-FX150 also has a nice ISO range from 100 to 6400, with many exposure functions = Manual, Program AE, Movie/ Motion Picutre, Intelligent Auto mode, along with many Scene modes. I always love the Manual exposure mode option, giving me full control of my camera when the meter is fooled. The metering mode options even include Spot metering. Sure, it doesn't offer an HD movie mode as other Lumix compact cameras do, but I wasn't looking for HD in a compact digital camera personally - what am I, movie-boy?To see a few shots I captured with this camera this past month, go to: [...]For more on all the technical specs, click here: Lumix DMC-FX150 tech specsFor more on the camera in general, go here: Panasonic Lumix DMC-FX150I highly recommend it to anyone- sure the digital noise increases with a higher ISO over 100 (mainly due to a small image sensor), but you can't expect everything in such a beautiful small package.

No regrets keeping this over my TZ5.", "Author": "None", "ReviewID": "R3NESWMXPFBI54", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my TZ5. The TZ5 is a great camera: awesome lens, easy to use, HD video, 3in high-res screen. The problem I had with the TZ5 is that it wasn't portable enough to `carry on me'. I finally made my rounds with the FX150 and got rid of my TZ5. No regrets!The FX150 fit the bill as a 'carry on me' camera. The extra megapixels are great for printing big photos. I've actually printed large fantastic photos, but find my self often shrinking photos for standard 4x6in prints. I don't find the photos more or less 'noisy' than my TZ5 (equivalent with the same ISO settings). The lens is great and the distortion is minimal (equivalent to my TZ5).The HD Video is only at 24fps, which shows a lot more artifacts (than the TZ5 at 30fps) if you're taking video of children or moving vehicles. I do wish it had the zoom feature in video, but after a while I got used to no having it. HD video output uses the same cable as the TZ5 (Panasonic DMW-HDC2) at 1080i. On bright days outdoor video looks great.I did carry a FX55 (great camera). The FX150 is substantially better in capabilities, but I do miss the 3\" screen on the FX55 and TZ5. I do wish the FX150 did have the 3\" screen high resolutions screen, as the 2.7\" screen is substantially smaller. The camera is `chunkier' than the FX55. Not a big problem, but more noticeable when in the pocket. I use a Timbuk2 carrying case that the camera fits perfectly into. It feels like a chunky flip phone on my belt waist.This is probably a bridge camera with features that will be 'standard' on Panasonic's next run of cameras. The focus tracking is good for things that move around a position. It looses track of running kids or fast moving vehicles.", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fairway Phil", "Author": "Philip C.

If you have large fingers, the camera may be cumbersome to use especially in the one handed mode. Screen always needs to be cleaned because the camera is so small with the screen taking almost all the back side.  Screen is good in all except facing bright sun.  I believe there is an adjustment for such, but I have not got around to that in the manual.  Just came back from Caribbean and the electronic markets down there have not seen this model yet. I believe the pricing thru amazon was competitive.  The face tracking recognition feature is cool. I'm a click and shoot photographer and do not want to wait to change settings or go to manual mode to get the perfect picture.  I'll shot 10 picts to get one good one and maybe fix it up in PhotoShop. Flash seems better than other comprobables. Batter last a long time on one charge.

I was attracted to all the features it offers and somewhat ignored the reviews I read about grainy images.After using it a little and having some images developped at the walmart 1 hour option, i think it takes really decent images.  Most taken were of children and skin tones were represented really well even in indoor images WITH flash.  No blown out tones and no really overly dark backgrounds.  All their eyes were strikingly blue and bright and skin tones were even.  Backgrounds were still understandably darker but overall not bad at all considering I used the auto mode with flash on.I like this camera.  Admitedly it doesn't have stellar iso capabilities like my DSLR and a prime lense but it does a great job for a 230$ p&s.; I wouldn't pay 400 for it like the orig. price was but it does a great job.  With a little careful shooting in a dimly lit room on auto no flash I got a nice crisp image that represented the dim lighting very accurately. Holding it steady it does a great job without needing a tripod.  Images can be slightly grainy but overall detailed and good quality for a p&s.;  Just don't expect high end quality and be happy with good, but not necessarily excellent image quality and this camera will suite the user just fine!  In good lighting it takes very good images but can still be a little grainy noticable in darker areas.  i dunno,  I like it.  it's not an SLR but it takes good pictures.  The conveniance is worth it.It feels solid in your hand.  the buttons on the back are a bit plasticky but overall a good user experience.  Most of the advertised features are built in and won't appear in the limited menus.  Switching to review an image can take about a second but loads up fast after that.  Shutter feels good for a p&s; and the wide angle as advertised feels nice.  It's a nice range for a p&s.;  Zoom goes to 7x, which I don't quite understand because it seems like there is someting mechanical moving all the way out to 7x but it advertised 3x.  pleasant surpise.  I like this camera and it'll be a good pocket friend when needed.  It doesn't take much room and isn't bulky like a Canon G9 or G10.

But once it arrived and was tested through a week, I was hugely disappointed to learn that the the camera couldn't take good pictures of any kind UNLESS it was with an ISO of 100 or 50, AND in bright sunlight.  The camera never produced colors that looked natural with good saturation despite any type of manual setting, and any picture taken at 200 ISO or above ALWAYS presents unacceptable levels of noise (worse when taking pictures in low lighting situations).  Recording in RAW format doesn't help at all, since the noise issue seems to be sensor related, and all it does is record all the noise with the RAW file.  For anyone who is a professional and look for amazing images, I recommend looking higher up the price range for a sigma DP2 or a Panasonic Lumix LX3, anyone who wants to keep the price within an affordable range should stick with the Canon's.

Most P&S; cameras have f5.6 lens which may not seem like a big deal but it means that 1/4 as much light gets to the tiny sensor inside the camera and this makes for a lot more noise and very grainy looking images. The camera has optical stabilization but best not to rely on it too much. There are 3 different modes of stabilization, with one just for video shooting.Battery life is excellent even when using the flash. I have never had to worry about running out of power and needing a second battery. The battery charges very quickly in the very compact charger that Panasonic provides.The camera has an automatic cover for the front of the lens that moves out of the way when the camera is powered on. It makes it easy to turn the camera off and slip it into a pocket or purse and not need to worry about dirt or fingerprints on the front of the lens or having it get scratched. A lot of pocket cameras have this feature but a great many do not.Camera focuses quickly and you can take pictures of very small objects at very close distances. RAW file capture does not seem to slow this camera down which is very unusual for a point and shoot camera. This speed requires using a SDHC card and not the internal memory which evidently is slower. I do not know the bit level of the RAW files but they do not seem to have any more dynamic range than 8-bit JPEG files from the camera.The only negative from my use of the camera is that even with the lowest resolution selected the image files are 2.5MB which compress down to 400-500K and are too large to email or use on a website without additional editing to shrink them down.An excellent camera overall for specific uses. If you want to take a picture that you can later make into a 11x14 print this camera is not going to be the one to use. Check out the new compact cameras from Sony and Sigma with their APS-C sized sensors. If you need something for documentation or snapshots for 8x10 or smaller prints this is an excellent camera that will easily fit in a pocket and be ready for use when you need it.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Panasonic FX-150K. A serious camera?", "Author": "Mel D.", "ReviewID": "R314OKAMAE5PKP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera for several reasons: good resolution, portability, reliability and price for the features. I am not disappointed. The camera functions well and, for the price, it was good value. It is not a serious camera, however, if you are thinking that it will do anything more than 4x6 snapshots of your family, the baby, or an eBay item for which you need a quick photo to post on your listing. Don't be fooled by the 14.7 MB resolution. You pretty much need to keep the ISO below 50 to get the noise down to manageable levels, otherwise, noise will contaminate the image and enlargement will not work well above the 4x6 level. The camera has some automatic ISO and flash and program features that make it a \"no-brainer\" for those quick snapshots of the family, and it also has a movie recording feature that works moderately well (but, noise again a factor). So, if you're looking for a small camera that fits in your pocket and is easy to use and will cost in the less than $200 price range, this is worth consideration. If you're interested in an alternative to a larger DSLR, forget it, you will be disappointed. The camera's RAW feature, however, requires software supplied with the camera to open RAW images--Photoshop will not open the images for editing, so shoot JPEG if you want to go directly to Photoshop to do limited editing.", "Date": "July 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Blur", "Author": "Big B in South Carolina", "ReviewID": "RUVHOE4SR51OL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not the best camera, with the image stablization on still get quite a few pictures blur.

The FX150 looked good on paper with a nice resolution and image stabilization, etc.First day of use, I actually had a need for the camera. I am a pilot and I fly old airplanes. We were supposed to fly in formation with a rare airplane that just got restored. I took the camera in my pocket and managed to get 3-4 shots in difficult conditions. Point and shoot was the name of the game. I knew I was taking a risk for framing but I figured I could crop the image given the high resolution of the camera. My trusted Casio does not have image stabilization so I was hoping the Panasonic would give much better results.The pictures I got were totally unusable. Framing was ok, but they were blurry, out of focus and low resolution to boot. Although I had played with the camera for a few shots before, the menus somehow got screwed up and the camera unexplicably reverted to a very low resolution. Once back on the ground - and without willingly changing any settings - we were back at full resolution again... Probably operator error. But I consider myself an experienced operator, and if I did this with this camera, it is bound to happen again.This camera failed me when I needed a mission-critical reliable piece of equipment. I returned it and ordered a Canon S90 that I just received and I am much happier with it.Very disappointing.", "Date": "November 1, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.95", "Features": "14.7-megapixel CCD captures enough detail for photo-quality poster-size prints\n3.6x wide-angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized zoom lens\nIntelligent Auto Modes include new side portrait and AF tracking; HD video capture\nFace Detection AF sensing up to 15 faces; Creative modes include multiple exposure and simple manual\nCapture images to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Panasonic DMC FX-150K 14.7MP Digital Camera with 3.6x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31LfODnAv3L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001CCJOGG"}}
