{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good value", "Author": "Anthony D Ravenscroft", "ReviewID": "R8NV2WVBNWNM0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought a C183 as an upgrade for my old (six years) CX6200. The improvements are pretty clear: moving up to 14 mp from 2 mp, 5x zoom instead of 3x, a viewer that's four times the size, slimmer body, many more picture-taking options, & all for $20 less.While the older Kodak has no focus feature at all, the C183 is constantly tweaking, which makes for some incredible super-fine photos that make for big-sheet enlargements that are almost studio grade.And that leads me to the small downsides I've encountered. First, the C183 makes \"disk reading\" sounds that might be bothersome. It's like having a cricket trapped inside. Nothing major, but it seems to be worrying some owners who aren't tech-savvy & think it may be broken. This also seems to take battery life down a little faster than with simpler cameras.Second, the C183 hesitates. Many of my photos are of home life, with animals & kids. When I press the shutter button on the CX6200, capture is immediate, & I almost always get exactly what I intended. The C183 hesitates about a half-second, which is not a problem at all for staged shots & still-lifes, but I don't think I'll be getting rid of the older camera anytime soon.Finally, the old camera has a physical viewfinder. If I keep the viewscreen off, I can snap hundreds of photos on one pair of batteries. The C183 doesn't have that \"old fashioned\" option.But, more upsides for the C183. While not as good as an actual video camera, it shoots GREAT video with sound, far better than you'll get from a cellphone. And uploading to YouTube (or whatever) is a breeze compared to older cameras. If you share a lot of video clips, the C183 is an excellent minimal-fuss all-around camera. I'm not impressed with the Kodak software, but all my computers have built-in chip slots, so I just swap the SD in & transfer.Because I got a bargain, this camera didn't come with a printed manual, but Kodak customer support is very good, so I just downloaded the manual from the Kodak website. The \"quick start\" brochure in the box is very basic, so be sure to get the full manual so you know how to access the 21 Scene modes (including things like super-closeup, low-light, & panorama), & you'll be taking \"difficult\" shots in a few minutes.Keep a few fresh bateries handy, spend maybe $20 on a big SD chip (I got a 4 gb SDHC that's got room for 9,999 huge photos!!), learn to ignore the cricket, & I think you'll be happy with this camera for years.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Basic point and shoot", "Author": "Shala Kerrigan", "ReviewID": "R2GBL0VG2XVOTT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a point and shoot for quick snaps and got this one on sale. It's pretty basic, 3x digital zoom that you operate using a switch on top of the camera, auto-focus by pushing the shutter button halfway down, take a picture by pushing it all the way down. It works fairly well as a point and shoot and will take fairly good pictures close up.Also takes video but I use a Flip for videos.I love the size of this camera. It's small enough to slip easily into a pocket or to fit in my purse, which makes it convenient to carry. The photos are large enough to make very nice prints.If you're looking for a good point and shoot that's easy to use for family snapshots that can be printed out for any relatives who prefer \"real photographs\", this works well.", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not bad", "Author": "Lilac Lily", "ReviewID": "R3I4K21BELAKW1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a simple point and shoot camera that takes pretty good pictures in all kinds of light settings. The price is low enough to put up with some of its shortcomings.Let's start with the positive aspects of it: It has 14 mega pixels which makes it easy to enlarge your favorite shots without any loss of picture quality. The size of the actual camera is small enough to fit in your pocket or purse, yet the camera doesn't feel fragile like other models and you won't need to worry about accidentally breaking it. There is a bright 3\" LCD screen which allows you to easily view your pictures even in bright sunlight. I also like the smart capture function which identifies the environment in which you are taking a picture and automatically adjusts its settings so you get the best possible picture every time.The are a few things that I don't like about the C183. The silver plastic buttons, for example, look and feel cheaply made. There is no separate viewer besides the LCD screen. The camera doesn't have a rechargable battery and the required AA batteries seem to run out very quickly. You can make video clips with this camera, however, in the playback mode there is no sound which I found highly annoying.Overall, if you are looking for a bargain the Kodak Easyshare C183 fits the bill. I think it would make a good first camera for kids or anyone looking for a cheap upgrade.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money...move on to something else", "Author": "Mistercommunication", "ReviewID": "R2HNSZHTG1NAOR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Kodak is infamous for their true-to-life color photos.  This one falls short of expectations.  However, at less than $50 it's a good camera for kids or basic beginners.Pros:-Large 3\" LCD Screen-Captures Video-Easy To Use-Software for YouTube/Flickr/Facebook uploads-Accepts newer SDHC cardsCons:-No sound playback on camera!  You have to d/l to PC to hear what you have recorded in video mode.  How lame is that?  A speaker for these would cost less than .50 cents to produce in China, so why omit this basic feature?-Slow shutter/capture speed.  Not suited for action photos-Photos inside under florescent lighting are unacceptable-Uses two AA batteriesSummary:Overall this is a decent camera for the kids, but if they want to record video and hear it WITHOUT a PC, then they will be disappointed just as my niece was.  If you're looking for a simple point-and-shoot camera and don't mind using AA batteries and want to take photos outside, then this may be for you.  Otherwise, spend the extra $20 and get a Li Ion rechargeable camera.", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very bad camera...", "Author": "DLE", "ReviewID": "R1612EEKGQE1UC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this camera at the Black Friday sale at Wal-Mart, but when I took it home and did the same tests as the C180 --- it failed. Here are the comparisons with the C180:C183- More features, but more confusing to operate.- Batteries didn't last that long.- Darker pictures, even with the flash on. Also, the pictures were grainy and unclear.- When I spun around, like I did for the C180 (in active kids mode), they were much more unclear and a lot of unsuccessful pictures.- The employees at Wal-Mart even commented that a lot people were returning them due to the same reasons as we were returning them.C180- Less features, but very easy to operate.- Batteries seem to last much longer.- Pictures seem to be well lighted and in excellent shape.- Did a spinning around test and took pictures (in active kids mode) as I spun around, and almost all the pictures still came out great.I would get the C180 camera by Kodak instead of this one.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice and Cheap", "Author": "Rashed Mokhtar Rashed \"Love, Ruwruw\"", "ReviewID": "R1MKUVIY8IY7JE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i Recommend this Camera in Refurbished or New Condition i bought both of them,,,(Whichever Cheaper) they're both work great! same quality,.....", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004OBZ23Q"}}
