It takes better pictures than my casio. We went to the zoo in ft. worth and she took so many pics (over 300). She is the camera queen now!! The pics came out really clear and colorful. Even the pics she took of the reptiles behind the glass turned out great. I would recommend this camera to anyone.", "Date": "March 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "bad camera", "Author": "E. Layfield \"traveling mia\"", "ReviewID": "RUSVYTZ9NG9E9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was a great camera when it worked, however, it broke after only 4 months and Sanyo said it only had a 90 day warranty. Nothing i did could have caused it to mess up, the lens is stuck.  When you go to the support website, lens is stuck is the top searched problem, not good.  I wouldn't get this camera unless you only need it for 4 months.  I do not want anymore items made by Sanyo, i thought it would be okay because i have have Sanyo TVs all my life, appearenly no quality with the camera.", "Date": "July 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera- and mine is even used!", "Author": "Beth \"Beth McLean\"", "ReviewID": "R1CEVCWWYQJFA0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my Sanyo e760 used- I was a little hesitant after reading some of the negative reviews on here about the cameras dying right away, but the seller I bought it from had it for over a year and loved it. They sold me the 7 megapixel because they were going to upgrade to 10- I don't see why the 7 is great! I've had this camera for a while now and its still working beautifully.The internal memory is really small, so I bought a 4 gb SD card for it- and omg I went from taking 11 pictures at the highest resolution/megapixel to 1732 photos!!! I can take as many pictures as I want now for a $20 upgrade- its worth it- buy it!I am also very happy with the video quality. You of course are going to have to invest the 20 bucks for the sd card but with it I can take 2.5 hours with of video on this little camera. I love it!Great for the amateur photographer/videographer!", "Date": "November 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Loved this camera until.....", "Author": "A. Huhn", "ReviewID": "R304IOGO8AM4O2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I loved this camera! It was very user friendly. The pictures were good for the most part. Sometimes a little grainy. However, a little over a year after I bought this camera the battery stopped holding a charge. I bought a new $35.00 battery but had the same problem. It is past it's warranty so I have to get a new camera. Probably won't buy a Sanyo because of this issue but I loved it while it worked!", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Crisp, sharp pictures", "Author": "Dima", "ReviewID": "R1MN1803UEMP03", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for your day-to-day pictures.

The first one, I loved so much, but accidently spilled OJ on it and it fried. So I was looking for the exact same camera and found it!! I carry it everywhere with me, it's always in my purse. It takes wonderful pictures and video. The battery last a very long time during use and when hanging out in my purse. I would highly recommend this little camera to anyone, IF you can find it!", "Date": "January 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera with lots of features", "Author": "Mistress Holly", "ReviewID": "R147G4Z74J1372", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Takes great pictures & has audio & video capabilities as well.

I would rather use a disposible camera. I've been a professional photographer for over 10 years and was looking for a cheap pocket camera for my young daughter. She picked this out because of the color and that's really the only thing going for it. I could not believe the horrible quality of pictures. My camera phone takes better pictures than this piece of junk.
