{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The most discrete hidden camera I have found", "Author": "FreeSpirit", "ReviewID": "ROZZDR85WE2A6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have tried at least 4 other type of hidden cameras without much success. Some were difficult to set up or use, while others were not really hidden. This hidden camera in an AC adapter is definitely the most discrete camera I have found and it actually works pretty well. My humble thoughts on the pros and cons of this device:PROs:- Very discrete, you can plug it in to an AC outlet and start using it immediately. The camera opening is not visible at all. If you don't know it's a hidden camera, you won't even know the lens opening no matter how closely you look at it - it's that discrete!- No batteries required, runs from power in the AC outlet. The cable attached to the end of the charger is not really required, I simply leave the charger plugged in without the cord. But you can attach it if you want to give the impression that it is actually charging something.- Motion activated, good this so it doesn't unnecessarily use up the SD card memory by recording empty walls when no one is in the room- Easy set up. Actually doesn't require any set up at all. Insert the memory card into the slot and you're good to go.- Decent video quality. It's not HD but it's clear enough to know what's going on. Not too grainy as some of the other devices I have tried. Overall not bad.- Playback - simply remove the memory card and plug it into your PC. I think it records in AVI format. Whatever format it is, it runs fine on my Media Player.CONs:- EXPENSIVE!! The price for a simple charger made of plastic is ridiculously high!! Most other devices sell for $40-50 or thereabout.- 30-second recording - The device records 30 seconds at a stretch. If there is continued motion, it will stop and start recording again (I think the interval between each stop and start is 1 min, but I'm not entirely sure of the exact time break).- No sound - sound would have been a perfect addition of features to this device.- Port for the wire - I think it will help tremendously if they simply include a USB port at the end of the charger instead of the current micro charging port they currently have, which only attaches the hanging wire without actually charging anything. A USB port will help charge a device so the charger doesn't look so out of place just sitting in the outlet by itself with nothing connected.Yes, it is an expensive device for what you get, but this seems to be the only good device that we have been able to find. If this was priced more reasonably (I think around $40-70), I would have gladly given it 5 stars.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works as advertised", "Author": "Mr. Guy Dudington", "ReviewID": "R2M2KJOM63G2WF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great device and does exactly what the description claims.  Works great as a security camera.  A couple notes on the recording though:1- When motion is detected, it records one minute of video (not 30 seconds like other review(s) state.  After that minute it will \"black out\" for 30 seconds, after which it can record again next time motion is detected.2- There is no audio available in the US.  The manual does show a microphone but after checking the manufacturer website, they claim that units sold in the US has no mic/mic disabled.  Presumably this is due to wiretapping concerns.3- Yes the video codec is unusual.  Windows Media player (on default windows 7 install) cannot play the video files.  And Quicktime didn't recognize it on my Macbook pro either.  I recommend getting VLC player (free) which plays everything, so you never have to think about codecs again.Pros:good picture quality, considering the size.  720X480.  I've seen other cameras that claim the same resolution but this one has good contrast and color depth.very efficient on disk space.  The 8-GB card can handle several days monitoring, depending on amount of motion in the room (Each 1-minute clip is 22.3 MB).extremely discreet.  you really won't recognize it as a camera, even if you know it's a camera and know where the lens is, you can't see the lens from > 5 feet away.no batteries to worry about.  With a large enough SD card you can monitor a space for months.cons:1 minute record time sometimes misses important details.uses quite a bit of power when not recording...it keeps the camera on to detect motion.no audio in the US.not good in low-light applications.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "AMAZING GREAT CAMERA", "Author": "Just a guy \"Me\"", "ReviewID": "R2DJ1K51QRM84W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Super stealthy.

The files are easily viewable. the sensor is sensitive so change in light would set it off. The files are not saved in order and are all mixed up. The biggest con is that there is NO AUDIO! This is highly annoying as seeing a person speaking on the phone but not hearing the conversation can be a great loss.

The motion sensing lags a little so make sure you have it set far enough back to see the action for several seconds.  I needed to watch something going on in my garage and it seemed like when the unit is in hot temperatures (late summer), it just recorded snow.  But inside, picture was clear and color was good.  The unit itself is top notch in being stealthy.  I was afraid the lens would be visible, I had to look for it.  What I like about this concept is power adapters are everywhere so it is never out of place.

Wish our outlets were vertical though so I didn't have to watch the video sideways.  Great way to see what is going on in your house during the day but not the best device if you want a continuous stream.  It shoots for a minute, shuts off for a minute, and come back on.
