Ltaestro \"Pat Maestro\"", "ReviewID": "R28FD1UQWROVCP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was really excited to see a camera with a built in projector and first saw the older S1000 on Amazon for half price of the newer s1100pj.I first bought the newer camera because it has a brighter Projector up to 14 lumis compared to up to 10 lumis of light projection on the older camera.I also liked the newer features such as Fisheye effect and 720p high difinition video recording.When amazon dropped the the price on the older camera s1000pj ($129.00) I decided to buy it and compare it to the newer version s1100pj and here are the results.The newer camera sucks at $309.00.First of all I had trouble getting the touch screen to respond when looking at my photos. The projector brightness doesn't look better then the older camera.The 3 inch view screen on the new camera remains on when projecting which is very annoying. The only way to shut off the viewer screen on the camera is when using the remote control.The fisheye effect is not fisheye at all. It's Nikon's way of adding a strange effect (Non-Adjustable) on photos already taken and cannot be used when shooting 16 X 9 photos or with Video recording.The older s1000pj is the only way to go.There's no touch screen which is better in my opinion and the Viewer screen on the camera automatically shuts off when using the projector.The brightness on the wall looks about the same as the newer camera's projector.The focus adjustment is a knob on the newer camera and a slider control on the older camera. Both are easy to use.Even the battery compartment on the older camera is more user friendly.I was having trouble removing the battery on the new camera as it would not drop out without the need of shaking the camera.Also, the description failed to mention that if you use the projector for a few minutes you must wait for the camera to cool for about 30 minutes before you can resume taking pictures so keep that in mind if you're at a party.The result is buy the older s1000pj Nikon camera. You will save money and have a better camera.", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect gadget for any geek", "Author": "Pointdexter", "ReviewID": "R1183N7C3HUCR0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned Nikon SLRs and own a Nikon D-SLR and wanted a smaller camera to take on shorter business trips and into places where SLRs camera are not always convenient or allowed. I had seen the videos/promos for this camera and wanted this before it even came out. I ordered via OneCall (one of Amazon's partners) on the first day it was available and so far I'm impressed. The touch screen works really well, menus are very obvious, picture quality is very acceptable for a point-and-shoot, video quality is very nice, battery life is acceptable (I ordered a spare battery as I have a history of taking many photos) and of course there is the projector, which most of you want to know about. In daylight it works well on a 8x11 size background from 1 to 2 feet away. Anything further away or colored background are not ideal in daylight. In a darker to dark room, you can actually go quite big, much bigger compared to stated, with reasonable quality. Obviously, the closer to the wall, the better the quality, but remember that this is just a very small projector, and it's built into a camera and not a stand-alone device or intended to be a stand-alone projector. Battery life suffers quickly using the projector and I wish they would not display the \"battery low\" indicator on the projected image, but that's how it works.Drawing on images while projected does not work as smooth as in the promos and the provided stylus is a better tool for this compared to using your fingers.Have to yet test it as a projector on a PC but assume this to be similar compared to projecting images.Overall it lived up to my expectations. Nikon has a gem with this one, and after testing the S1000pj at a retail store, it seems like quite an improvement over last year's model. It's a good camera and for a geek like me, it's also a sweet gadget.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazon's GREAT, Nikon is NOT!!!!", "Author": "SVMOJITO", "ReviewID": "R28E1IP5U8V8I1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Shortly after receiving this camera the shutter button/zoom switch became problematic.  I contacted Amazon and they replaced it, no questions asked.  Kudos to Amazon's excellent customer service.  The second camera developed the same problem after six months, obviously a design flaw.  Amazon then referred us to Nikon customer service and gave us a $30 gift certificate for our troubles.  Since then, dealing with Nikon's customer service has been a nightmare for an obviously flawed product.  The denied any fault and said Amazon probably dropped the boxes the cameras were stored in and have insisted that we pay $84.00 to repair the camera.  They also refused to allow us to speak to a manager or some higher authority.  Feeling like we had not other choice, we agreed to pay the $84.00 to repair this $300+ camera.  That was four months ago, they have not received the part for the repair as yet and we are without a camera.  It remains to be seen when and how this will be resolved.

Connecting it to a PC requires installing a software using a CD they provide. The projection lags a lot on a netbook. You have to switch the settings of the camera every time you want to change from uploading photos to computer and using the computer as a projector. The whole camera is pretty big in size compared to regular digital cameras but can't complain on a device with a built-in projector. The camera has some pretty nice features, though some requires the user manual to help you find out what they do. The flash is very powerful and there is a touch to focus/exposure on taking pictures. Not on video though, unfortunately. The touch screen sometimes lags a little and requires more pressure than smartphones such as the iPhone.

Maybe I'm just too used to the iPod Touches screen.The projector is very nice, but it has to be pretty dark to be \"very nice\". It's really nice to be able to show off your pictures or videos on up to a 47\" screen instead of everyone huddling around you and the tiny camera screen right after you took a picture or something. Overall, this is a very worthy camera and I highly recommend it. Picture quality is great and it takes 720p High Definition video. Also, the sound quality is pretty good as well.

Marks", "ReviewID": "R2JGBFTAFB9OSG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The novelty of the built-in projector is what attracted me to this camera.  As a woodcarver, it is useful to have some way to project an image for tracing onto a block of wood, and I expected to use this camera for that purpose.  I also anticipated selling my Panasonic Lumix 6MP camera and Aiptek Action HD GVS camcorder on eBay, because I figured that I wouldn't need them anymore if I had the Coolpix, with its triple threat of camera, camcorder and projector.  Wrong!  Despite a higher pixel format, the Coolpix still shots failed to capture the same richness and detail as my Lumix.  And, you have to wait an unacceptable amount of time until the Coolpix is ready to take its next still shot!  The HD camcorder was really fuzzy on panorama-type shots, and even when set to continuous auto-focus, it failed to focus on the subject when I zoomed in.  That was really surprising and I considered the relatively poor video function as a dealbreaker. Image color balance with both camera and camcorder were also too blue/cool for my taste.  I could have gotten along just fine with the built-in projector, but the other Coolpix components made me reject this camera.  I've never owned a Nikon before...they were too expensive, but I'd always wanted one.

I was attracted to this camera because of its built-in projector.  I figured that it would be a great way to share my photos while amongst friends or family...and since it was a Nikon 14MP camera, I took for granted that it would display better quality pictures than my Casio Exilim 10MP.  I was wrong. The pictures are not as sharp as my 10MP Casio, and the exposure is pretty erratic.  In addition, it has the worst shot-to-shot performance than my previous cameras (Sony, Canon, Casio), which is quite an embarrasment when taking group photos.  I usually take 2 or 3 shots of a group to be able to choose the best outcome, but having to make the subjects wait for about 10 seconds in between photos is absurd (that's a long time to freeze their smiles and keep their eyes from blinking).  I've used the built in projector when the camera was new, impressing those who would see it, however, since I have now lost confidence in the quality of photos, I don't even use it anymore.  With these disappointing results I cannot wait for 2 more years to purchase my next camera...and it certainly won't be a Nikon.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointed with Nikon", "Author": "SweetPacino", "ReviewID": "R2RZB9UKVTRZ1S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After reading all the reviews, I was pretty excited to snag this camera for $130.  The Nikon brand has a good rep and I had read some good reviews on the camera.I couldn't get the camera to take a decent picture.  I tried many settings on the camera as well as many different environments.  Most of the pictures came out blurry, had horrible red-eye (that was unfixable with basic software), and under/over-exposed.The lens on the camera does not move in and out on the camera, and I wonder if that is what is causing the focusing problem, or maybe I had a defective one (which could explain the cheap price from Amazon?).  Nonetheless, I still didn't think it worth the $130 I paid for it.  I have an old Canon Powershot that takes pictures far superior to this one.I like that you can zoom in and out during video, but the zoom is not smooth and has a bit of a learning curve to learn the increments.The projector is a cool feature, and works OK, but it has to be pretty dark to use it.If you are on the fence about this one, choose another.

Gehret \"G-Man  Colorado\"", "ReviewID": "R43QV5RGGX95E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nikon created 3 very different projector cameras in this Series. The initial launch was the S1000pj which is impressive. Built (most solid) However, It didn't offer the larger screen which are 3 inch. But Nikon's first launch is well throught out, nicely designed, rugid and a winner. The Second model, S1100pj had many changes/improvements from the first. And, the final projection camera (S1200pj)...is stellar.  The S1100pj is the ONLY one which offers touch screen menus, a round dial for focusing, (with activation inside of the focus dial). Not so impressive is the SD Card/Battery compartment hinge ..which is flimsy and feels as if it could break. On the plus side, the touch screen is nice, but users will need to read how to erase or trash shots they don't want to keep. Set-up (via touch screen) is fairly well laid out..gives the user many choices and features. The zoom (while shooting in video mode) is really smooth and very nice. The power useage for this particular model, is fairly rapid ..so users will need 2 or 3 batteries for back-up. This model includes the remote control when projecting and a great idea. The Sound Quality is SUPERB. Infact, all 3 models provide the VERY BEST SOUND (of ANY compact camera). The built in speaker allows users to actually increase or decrease sound . I was amazed with its clearity and loudness for such a small digital.Bottom Line....I am on the fence with this model, when Nikon's final model (in this series) the S1200pj truly is The VERY BEST . They both offer a \"fill light\" when shooting in video mode, and both later models offer a Video button for quick capture in video mode.The S1200pj continued with great sound, a fill light for videos, a projector dust cover which also activates the projector.  It's much brighter DLP projector allows users to project to 60 inches and has a built-in bottom stand.Each of the Nikon projection cameras are different yet impressive. It comes down to an individuals particular taste. I really like each for their unique and different designs and features. I would give 5 STARS to the final model (S1200pj) and this model - 3 1/2 Stars.  Regardless of model..the user and their audience will be impressed. Video playback projections are its strong hold. Others bought these cameras for using the projector for their cellphone or laptop.

I purchased the camera was to utilize the projection feature via usb from pc photos/clip art but FAIL!!!On a perfectly smooth flat white surface the image is fuzzy, dark, colour and shape of the projected image is highly distorted, and forget the 'focus', there is no focusing the photos to be usable.The camera makes a whirring sound I assume that is the mechanics of the projector as none of my numerous digital cameras made such a noise.I purchased this camera about 3 months ago, have used it no more than 3 hrs. tops all of which was trying to get it to work as Nikon described it does with zero percent success.  It has been nothing but intense frustration, headache and sure as heck did not live up to ANY expectation I had.I am sending it back.

For the price, the camera isn't too bad (not to mention it's a Nikon). First and foremost, I even admitted to my friends that the projector feature sounds really cool, but in reality, I have not and cannot think of an occasion where I think I would be able to use it for a purpose other than to say \"my camera has a projector\". The projector itself is pretty good quality if the background you are shooting on is flat with dim lighting.The camera itself is just ok... I bought the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH20K 14.1 MP Digital Camera ([...]) last year and it is a MUCH better camera as far as quality and ease of use. I don't have a problem with the touch screen on the Nikon, but the scene settings (for lighting) are very limited. It takes decent pictures in the dark but overall, the quality of any picture I take seems to be a bit blurry compared to the very crisp quality from the Panasonic camera.The zoom function is my biggest gripe of this camera: it's one of those dials that you control on the top of the camera to zoom in and out, but rather than a smooth zoom, it zooms in increments, so it's very hard to get customized control. As I said before, the quality of the picture is severely compromised when zooming in (even before you hit the digital zoom).Overall, if you can get this camera for a good price, go for it, but if you're looking for a more long-term digital camera, I would go with something else.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lots to learn", "Author": "C.
