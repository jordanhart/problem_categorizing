Network aware.Cons - would be nice to have a gigabit ethernet connection.  The mouse is awful.  The remote sensor is about as weak as they come.  Recommend administering over network once initially set up.  Does not recognize 4TB drives (but in all fairness - it doesn't claim to).Overall - Put this in one of my clients shops; for the cost, he couldn't be more pleased.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$109.99", "Features": "D1/Half D1/CIF Real-time Recording and Playback.
