{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing value!", "Author": "BrownieMoose", "ReviewID": "R3BGLHP4WXO4RE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the Canon to replace an outdated SLR that I have been using for years.  After countless hours of research I decided on the Canon T5i.  The additional lenses alone cost several hundred dollars so I was pleased to see the extra lens was included in this package  The lens (55-250) is genuine Canon.  Works GREAT!!  Was not totally pleased with the extra flash.  It's not genuine Canon, that's for sure.  However, extra battery charger and the side shutter is AMAZING!!  The other gadgets and gizmos were a nice treat.  I will also note the wireless flash is not 100% compatible with all the features of the camera.  (Only instant shutter release, no 10 second delay as offered on the camera itself.)  All in all I can't complain and I stand firm on my 5 star rating.  Great value for sure!  (And packaged well also!!)", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,239.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 15 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Canon EOS Rebel T5i Digital SLR Camera & EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Lens + <2> Canon EF-S 55-250mm STM Lens + <3> Canon 2400 DSLR Camera Case +\n<4> Transcend 64GB SDXC 10 Card + <5> Precision Design DSLR300 Flash + <6> Zeikos BG-E8 Battery Grip + <7> Spare LP-E8 Battery +\n<8> Battery Charger for LP-E8 + <9> 58mm UV Filter + <10> 67mm UV Filter + <11> RC-6 Shutter Remote Control +\n<12> PD HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable + <13> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <14> PD 8 SD Card Memory Card Case + <15> LCD Screen Protectors", "Name": "Canon EOS Rebel T5i Digital SLR Camera & 18-135mm IS STM & 55-250mm IS STM Lens with 64GB Card + Battery + Case + Flash + Grip + Filters Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61wsnd75IxL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GHY3NAW"}}
