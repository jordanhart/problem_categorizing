It captures an excellent image both indoors and out. The only problem I have encountered is its voracious appetite for AA batteries...I suggest strongly that if you wish to purchase this camera that you also purchase at the same time a battery charger, and TWO sets of rechargeable batteries! Otherwise you will be unable to make a complete record of your child's birthday party!The reason I did not make this a 5-star evaluation is because the illustrated picture is NOT the Vivitar Vivicam 6300, but is another model in the 6300 series- I believe it is Vivicam 6300s, which is the slimline model. However, if you are in the market for a first digital, this is a very good choice.", "Date": "January 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Vivitar Vivicam-6300 digital camera comes through with flying colors!", "Author": "Jana Payne", "ReviewID": "R1KU08RTI2XCBJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought 2 Vivicam Vivitar digital cameras, one for each of my children. Both of them had no trouble getting acquainted with the cameras and were quickly charging them and then using them. So far we have experienced no problems at all and they both use them daily. My middle-schooler carries her around with her constantly. If there is anything I could say needs improvement, it would be the cases for the cameras. Though adequate, they are thin and don't provide a lot of protection. But the cameras are all I had hoped for.", "Date": "January 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Not worth the money", "Author": "P.

This camera was low quality even when it was first released. The 3x optical zoom in incredibly limited and the sound card is horrible. I still have videos taken with this camera and I always have to turn the volume up or down several times during playback because the camera just didn't handle loud noises (like cheering or a loud bass) very well.I purchased a better camera the first chance I got.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Image resolution up to 2816 x 2112\n2x digital zoom\nAutomatic white balance with presets for Daylight, Cloudy, Tungsten, Fluorescent, and Sunset\nRecords short movies in MPG format\n5- and 10-second self-timer", "Name": "Vivitar VIVICAM-6300 6.0 MP Digital Camera with 3X Optical Zoom", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PEGZT1HSL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000BZ6T2M"}}
