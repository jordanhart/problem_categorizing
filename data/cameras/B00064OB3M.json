The design works perfectly for my needs. I wanted to be able to carry my digital camera and get excellent pictures where ever I go. I was maticulous in my selection and my research paid off in this camera. Initially I was going to go sony for their design and memory stick capability. But, I wanted the Canon quality that people spoke of in their reviews. The solution: The Canon Powershot SD20. Now I leave my Canon Rebel SLR at home, and don't miss it much. I love the built in zoom, the point-and-shoot, the cristal clear quality and numerous shooting modes. Usually I don't need the full 5MP and I set the camera at a convenient lower setting so no resizing is neccesary when I load the pictures onto my computer. This makes it very easy to send my friends the pics by simply selecting the file from my desktop as an attachment. I love this thing!

It also would make an excellent camera for the casual photographer. The camera is tiny, really really small but takes great pictures. Despite size of camera, alll controls are easy to use. Complex menus are Canon-easy-to-use but you could also just point and shoot and never worry about the menus. Only fear about this camera is losing it. Thought of getting the SD300 but who needs the zoom really for the use this camera will be seeing?

I was concerned that the camera was so tiny that my hand would shake, and the images would come out blurry. But despite the small size, I took hundreds of pictures, and they've come out beautifully.I transferred them to my Apple IPOD Photo, as well as my Apple Imac computer, and have even printed them through Apple. Now don't get me wrong....I know I sound like I'm writing a review on Apple, but once I printed the pics, I was astonished at the clarity and the amazing details from the pictures once I received them.The big \"con\" of the camera is the small screen on the back. There are so many new small point and shoot cameras that now have 2-inch to even 2 1/2 inch screens on the back of the camera.  And there's no optical viewfinder on this camera, nor an optical zoom - but it's all really unnecessary when you have a camera this small.Those are the tradeoffs.  BUT, this is a camera that you will certainly want to carry along with you everywhere! It's not bulky, and you never even notice that you have it in your pocket. I went down the ski slopes with it, and even stuck it in my jeans pants pockets. It never bothers you with its weight, and you'll see that you'll always pull it out to snap some photos of friends.Advice: Buy a backup battery!!  Buy a big SD file card. I got a 1GB card, and on superfine mode, and the highest resolution, it allowed me close to 400 pictures!Great camera, and highly recommended.", "Date": "February 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "Canon=quality", "Author": "Jay \"Jay\"", "ReviewID": "R2U4GMXUB21OT4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did some research before i bought this camera. I had heard that Canon made quality products and i liked the specs of this camera so i decided to go with it. Sure there are cheaper 5 megapixel cameras out there, but they do not capture true to life color in their pictures like this camera does. Go to the canon website and download a full resolution picture that was taken with the SD20 if you dont believe me.Pros:5 megapixels  True to life color  Very detailed pictures  User friendly yet also has advanced features  Tiny, tiny compact size  Easy to take anywhere(i take mine with me everywhere)  Video has decent quality  Camera is beautiful  Comes with a leather case  Bundled software is fun to use  Battery life is awesome(i've gone 3 days before recharging)  Charging time is only an hour to hour and a halfCons:I still havn't found any. An optical zoom might be nice but i havnt missed it.This camera is great. It looks beautiful and everyone around you is going to want one. More importantly though it is a quality product in a small compact case. If you plan on taking this with you on vacation though, i would recomend a bigger memory card. It comes with a 32MB card which will allow you to store 20 pictures on the highest resolution but i bought a 512MB card which allows me to store 350 Pictures at the highest resolution.

The camera easily fits in (almost) any pocket and even the smallest of purses. It's about the size of a small cell phone. I constantly get comments on the color and the size of the camera. And the matching camera case-color just adds to it!But enough about aesthetics - the camera provides excellent picture quality in really any type of setting (although i haven't tried underwater)- as do all canons. And the menus and features of the camera are very user friendly. You can read the specs yourself - but the main features I use regularly are the various shooting modes (nightime, indoor, auto, etc.), quick shot and video.For the cons, the camera doesn't have optical zoom, the LCD is fairly small (a little over an inch square) and there is no optical viewfinder. The lack of optical zoom is the biggest drawback in my opinion. However, with 5MP - I can zoom and crop to my hearts content without losing much if any clarity/quality - particularly when you are talking 4x6 photos or online photos. I imagine the small LCD can be tough if you don't have great eyesight - but hasn't bothered me at all. The lack of an optical viewfinder is tough when you are taking pictures in a dark area (like at a nightclub) - you really can't see anything. In the second when the flash goes off you can adjust a little if you are pointing in the completely wrong area. Which goes to my last thought on cons. In a review I read before buying someone warned that if you have big hands, or unsteady hands - the camera is so small it can be a little unwieldy to hold still. And this can result in blurry pictures. I've only had this happen once - when a waiter was taking a group picture for me. Disappointing - but in the year I've had this camera has only happened once. In fact, I've tried to take blurry pictures by shaking the camera while shooting, and the pictures still come out clear....can't really figure that one out.....Overall, I really like this camera. I was looking for a small stylish camera that I could take anywhere easily but that would also take great pictures. I hate carrying things around, so if i couldn't fit it in my pocket or my tiniest purse, I knew i would never end up using it. I was aware of the drawbacks to this camera before I bought - but for my point and shoot and portability needs decided it would work for me. And I've been very happy with it.The lack of optical zoom/viewfinder may drive some people crazy - if so I might recommend the canon sd400. It's only slightly bigger than the sd20 (but only comes in silver), and has expanded features. It's slightly heavier also. But still, a very portable camera.", "Date": "August 29, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great compact digital", "Author": "Patricia E.

In order to give everyone out there an easy to follow and easy to understand review, I wont get into all the details, but some important features about this camera are; 1 - its size! The camera is ultra small and very lite! It puts my older S200, which I had always considered to be small and lite, to absolute shame! Throw it in your shirt pocket and head out. Just be sure to remember you brought it along or you may forget its there. That's how small and lite it is. The image quality is amazing! Just like all the other Canon cameras I've had, the SD20 is no diferent. The pictures are sharp, crisp and very clear. This is one of the best point and shoot 5 Megapixel cameras on the market today! No doub't about it and if you're shopping around, don't look any further! Its packed with great features even to please the most stringest photographer, if not amaze them! Take my word on this one, this is one awesome camera! The one drwaback, well its not a drawback, being that it packs 5 Megapixels of punch, you're going to need a nice sized CD memory card to store all those great pictures. I opted for a 1GB. With a 1GB card at full 5 Megapixels and Super Fine quality, you can store around 400 images. At Fine quality still at 5 Megapixels, the storage bumps up to 700 images. Drop the image quality a bit more, and 1GB card can hold thousands of images. It's your best bet!

Well, either I'm in the minority or I got a defective camera bc this camera is just horrible. First let's talk about the mini screen. One of the reasons I bought this was bc of the small size and the fact that I could fit it in my pocket. Had I known just how tiny the screen is, I would have never bought it. Another gripe of mine are the settings. There are so many which makes it extremely confusing so I would usually end up using the auto setting. This camera takes decent indoor pictures if you turn off the flash. With the flash on, or in any dim lit settings, forget about night time, the picture quality is HORRIBLE. Everyone's skin color comes out yellow or some off shade. Even with the indoor pictures, the color quality is horrible. I've tried playing around with the settings to where I get somewhat decent colors, but really who has the time to do that. If you use the flash at an evening event, the background will be extremely dark and if you auto zoom you loose even more of the realistic colors.Then there's the battery life. I will fully charge the battery and the cameara dies out after taking I don't know 20 pictures. I think I got a defective battery, camera or something. If you are thinking of taking a picture of something moving, all you will get is blur. I really can say I hate this camera.

Ever since I bought this camera, I have routinely been complimented on my photos.  When I look at the new Canon cameras and compare the technology and the price of these new cameras I am amazed.  Obviously, I know we need to go forward and I am looking at the Canon SD880.  If I could go backward, I would buy the same Canon SD20 that has accompanied me in my pocket for years.  I am never without my camera as long as I have a pocket.  I am still amazed at all of the features that you can take advantage of with the SD20.", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "reliable sharp convinent", "Author": "Nadeem Durrani", "ReviewID": "R3KXIX7RF4GW2O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "canon is awesome hands down.  bought mine 2+ years ago for $330, this camera has dings and scratches on it from world wide traveling and yet has no problems.  where ever i go i can throw it in my jeans pocket and take candid snaps on the go.  fits smaller than a pack of ciggs, what more can you ask for?  video is decent but sonys is just better, what makes this better than my old sony is the picture quality, so much sharper!!  learn the settings and modes and you're set for great pictures no matter where you are.", "Date": "June 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "Jennifer Bautista \"jeng\"", "ReviewID": "RUNPI6KYZQY15", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the SD10, the older model of this camera for over a year now.  It's cute, stylish, compact and takes great pictures, but my main complaint is that digital zoom merely crops the picture rather than actually zooming, so the zooming makes you lose quality and all my pictures that were zoomed are very grainy.  I have to use a huge setting and just manually crop my pictures myself on adobe if I want to \"zoom\".  Aside from that, there are no complaints, although I think I'd opt for a Sony the next time around because of their \"burst\" feature (I think it's fun, but unnecessary).", "Date": "February 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "great small camera for girls", "Author": "Jian Fang \"Lance\"", "ReviewID": "R5071W9R5G7SY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this canon camera for it is really small and nice looking, it runs a little slow on original 32mb card, I will purchase a faster 256/512 sd card in near future, the bonus is the very nice and comfort leather case, almost same color as my camera's garnet. 5mp is good enough for daily shot.

I have noticed that 80% of the pictures I have taken, have the red eye.  We just recently went on a cruise, and the camera does not take very good quality pictures inside a comedy club with decent lighting... the people moving around were blurry.  Lastly, when I went to power on the camera yesterday, it makes an awful noise, and then the screen blinks the canon logo, then goes black with an E18 error.  I contacted Canon, and its not covered by warranty, and the repair will cost more than the camera did new.  They claim that it was due improper use or mishandling.  The camera went dead while it was on, and the shutter is left extended... Recharged the battery, and now the shutter will not go back in... and thats MISUSE?
