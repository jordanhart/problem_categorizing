{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Straddles the line between point & shoot and DSLR", "Author": "M. Erb", "ReviewID": "R3OOP0YJICZ0JO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE: 1/11/2011 - Because there are so many comments asking the same question I decided I should add this to the beginning to save you agony. This camera is poor in low-light and not the greatest for taking shots of kids running around or in situations where you need to quickly take multiple shots. Having said that, this camera has an absolutely amazing zoom, optics are top notch, macro mode is incredible and great video recording is possible as well. I've taken thousands of beautiful photos with this camera. You need to work with this camera and it will reward you handsomely. But read through as many comments as you can because there is a lot of discussion that may interest you. And now on to my original review...I have two types of cameras that I generally use, small point & shoots, like the Canon Canon PowerShot SD600 6MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom for \"take anywhere\" convenience and DSLR's which for me currently is the Nikon D300 DX 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)If you have any questions about the camera, leave a comment and I'll do my best to answer you. Please note that I have updated my review with some additional observations on 3/29/2010 based on my continued experiences with the camera.I wanted to get a camera that was SDHC compatible (the SD600 is not SDHC compatible, while the D300 uses CF cards) so that I could use the Eye-Fi wireless card Eye-Fi 4GB Share Video SDHC Wireless Flash Memory Card EYE-FI-4SV with it. I've had excellent results with small Canon point & shoot cameras over the years but the Nikon L110 caught my eye and I decided to buy it. It is substantially larger than the svelte Canon SD600, yet much smaller and lighter than my D300. It's called a \"bridge\" camera by some people since it has some qualities reminiscent of a DSLR at the expense of being as small and pocketable as a typical \"point & shoot\" camera. Consequently, depending on where you are on the scale of novice to professional photographer and how pocketable you need your camera to be, this camera may either thrill you or leave you wanting something else. I'm somewhere in the middle.There is a lot to like about this camera. It has a very nice feel in the hand and the rubberized grip makes you feel secure holding the camera. The large 3\" LCD display is gorgeous... it is bright, sharp and has excellent dpi not normally found in a camera of this price range. It also works quite well outdoors due to the fact that it has an anti-reflective coating on it. However the camera lacks an optical viewfinder which I do miss as I am more accustomed to using a viewfinder than not. The lack of a viewfinder is not a deal-breaker for me though. 12.1 megapixels gives you ample file size to make huge enlargements or lots of room for cropping. And the awesome zoom, from the 35mm equivalent of 28mm-420mm gives you an amazing range. It's not normally even possible to hand-hold a camera and expect a very sharp image if you are zoomed to 420mm, or even 300mm, but with the great VR and Motion Detection incorporated into the camera, you can actually hand-hold at that extreme and get usable images. I was impressed with that. If you use a tripod at those extremes, then be sure to turn off the VR or you will get poor pictures. This is always the case with electronic VR... you never want to use it when also using a tripod since it is intended to compensate for your hand shake and when you're on a tripod, there is no hand shake to correct so it is not necessary or desirable to have  VR on.The L110 has a minimal number of buttons and control pads which makes it a very approachable camera to use. Of course, the downside to that is you need to delve into the menu to get to some other features or controls that you may want to fiddle with. Again, coming from the D300, I found this a bit frustrating but someone more used to a point & shoot might not mind or even think about that as much.What I like specifically about the camera is that I can take stunning photographs with little thought. Using the default \"easy auto mode\" lets you get started taking photos with little to worry about. Just frame your subject and press the shutter button. But you may not want to keep the camera in that mode all the time because it does come with some limitations that you need to be aware of. Easy Auto Mode automatically determines what you are trying to accomplish then sets the \"scene\" to what the camera thinks is the appropriate setting... it may not always be correct. And I noticed that auto-focus may not always work correctly especially when trying to shoot closeup images in easy auto mode. So in those cases you can switch to \"auto mode\" or manually select the \"scene\" to the mode you specifically want, such as \"close-up, portrait, landscape, backlight, etc\"The macro mode on this camera is excellent. You can get as close as .4 inches from your subject and this is fantastic if you are into macro photography. I will post some sample photos in the customers images area for you to see.I like that the camera can be turned on directly in playback mode simply by pressing the playback button instead of the on/off button. The advantage to doing this is that if you just want to view photos/videos on the camera, the lens remains retracted.  Otherwise if you turn the camera on using the on/off button, then press the playback button, the lens first extends then goes into playback mode.The flash does not automatically flip up when needed like some cameras of this style. That's not a bad thing, just something you need to know. If the camera determines that flash is necessary, it does display a message on the LCD screen informing you to \"Raise The Flash.\"The buttons on the back of the camera only require a very light touch. At first this annoyed me a little bit as they felt overly \"touchy\". But I quickly grew accustomed to the lighter touch and now must say I like it.Video quality is very very good, especially in outdoors and well-lit situations. Low light results in more grain than I would like to see, but since this is not a dedicated video camera, nor expensive, it is acceptable. The audio recorded in video mode (stereo by the way) is very good too.UPDATE: I've been using the movie mode more extensively since my original review and have changed my opinion of the audio and video quality. The low light performance of video recording is not very good at all and results in -very- noisy (grainy) video. I've also noticed a significant muffled quality to the sound that is especially noticeable when just a persons voice is recorded. Recording where the ambient noise levels are high, such as when outside, masks this somewhat. But when recording video in more quiet surroundings, a single sound source such as voice will present the distortion, hiss or whatever you want to call it, at much more noticeable levels and is not what I would call good quality at  all. On a scale of 1-10 I'd have to rate the audio quality  about a 4. There is no capability to attach an external mic, nor would I expect that for a camera in this price range. The audio quality is quite disappointing to me now though, especially when compared to my Canon SD600 that has extremely clear, distortion free (mono) audio. Finally, I also heard some zoom induced mechanism noise while zooming and recording video.One feature that really appeals to me is the \"small picture\" option. If you take a lot of photos that eventually end up on the web, you can have the camera make a smaller sized copy of any photo that you have taken... either 640x480, 320x240 or 160x120. I find this really helpful because if you take your original photo at a lower resolution, then that's what you're stuck with forever. But with this feature you can take your photos at the highest resolution then have the camera make a re-sized copy of the photo at the resolution you specify. I build websites so this is very helpful for me as I don't have to spend as much time in Photoshop resizing photos destined for the web.There are a slew of other features, such as \"blink warning\", automatic red-eye fixing, smart-portrait mode, sport continuous mode (pretty cool feature that will take up to 20 continuous photos at 11.1 fps) and even more. Regarding the Sports Continuous Mode; this mode reduces the image quality/size to a maximum of 3Megapixels and is not going to give you razor sharp images that you would get in other modes. But consider it's purpose... to get a shot that would otherwise be nearly impossible using this level of camera. It takes a burst of photos to enable you to hopefully get a decent action shot out of a series of shots taken at a moment in time. The ISO is also increased to 640 in this mode which does inject more noise into the final image. This is common to small sensor cameras such as this. You really want to keep the ISO at as low a value as possible to reduce \"noise\" in the photo. Increasing the ISO increases the sensitivity of the sensor and this is what causes the increased noise... think of it as distortion when you turn the volume up to high.I'd have to write a book to cover all the features in detail. But one more feature that I'll mention is Panorama Assist which is handy when composing a series of shots intended to be a panorama. It provides a ghost image of the previous shot to help you align the next shot you want to take in your series of photos destined to be a panorama.Nikon includes several software titles including Panorama Maker Pro by ArcSoft. I was happy with the results that Panorama Maker Pro produced; it was easy to use and flexible in what you can do with it.Battery life is quite good. The camera uses 4-AA batteries, either alkaline, Ni-MH, or lithium. That makes it convenient if you have dead batteries since AA batteries can be purchased anywhere. Proprietary batteries often provide longer life, but once they're dead, so are you if you don't have a charger or second charged battery with you.A few issues for me with the camera is that I am frequently wanting to manually focus the camera and that is not possible. Another issue is that other than setting ISO and exposure compensation, there is little else you can manually do to control the camera. You cannot manually set the shutter speed or aperture. Concerning ISO, when it is set to 3200 or 6400 the image mode settings are limited to 3 megapixels 2048x1536, PC 1024,768 or VGA 640x480.Overall I like the Nikon L110 quite a bit. The photos are excellent and HD video is a nice extra although you won't be too happy with lower light video quality and the audio capabilities are not the best. It strikes a nice balance between a simple point & shoot camera and a larger and substantially more expensive DSLR. It's a product that because of it's price point, will not meet everyone's expectations. If you desire excellent video from this camera, you'd be better off spending more and getting something that is video-centric. If you view this as predominantly a camera that also has the ability to take video, then you'll probably be OK with this. If you are expecting this under $300 camera to also excel at taking movies with awesome audio, you will not be happy. Concessions will have to made at this price point.UPDATE: 4/4/2010- Just a brief update regarding battery life using plain old Alkaline batteries. I took over 300 photos plus 20-30 movies of varying length and did quite a bit of viewing before the batteries died. That's not bad for regular Alkaline batteries. Consider also that I am also using the Eye-Fi wireless SDHC card in the camera that automatically uploads any photos or movies through my wireless network so that is also putting a drain on the batteries. Without the card, I would expect even better battery life than what I've reported.  You'd get much longer life with Lithium and of course rechargeable NiMH batteries would probably be the best long-term bang for the buck.UPDATE: 4/22/2010- I've uploaded a few video snippets from the L110 on YouTube. Just search for \"Nikon L110 Video Sample\". They will not win any Academy Awards for cinematography but just a really quick indication of video quality.

Cool pics!", "Author": "Alexandru Mazilu", "ReviewID": "R21FPBSOEY6ADE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the L110 for the main purpose of taking pictures of my two kids. They are not still subjects and the L110 is doing a great job in keeping up the pace with them. It pops-up in like 2 seconds and is shooting rounds of pictures at max resolution (12.1). That's for speed.Wide angle and super-zoom are in the manual. What is impressive is that at max zoom (digital zoom included) - with no tripod - I get to take sharp pictures. That's for image stabilization.After ~500 pics and ~30 min of HD video, the original AA Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries are still fully functional. No warning yet.----Later edit. I took around- 1100 pictures with the original AA Energizer Ultimate Lithium (L91-FR6) batteries ([...]).- 400 pictures with some alcaline AA Energizer (LR6-E91-AM3) batteries ([...])- 500 pictures / recharge with some rechargeable Energizer AA 2450 mAh.All pictures were taken at maximum resolution and the flash fired for about 80% of those pics.----The stereo HD video recording under the same hood is a treat. The maximum length for one video session is 30 minute (regardless of SD capacity) which is decent for birthday parties and similar.Unfortunately, this is no camera phone that you can slip into a pocket until you need it. The only draw back I can see.I test drove both Nikon Coolpix L110 and Canon SX200IS before I decided on Nikon. Size is the only advantage of the compact vs bridge, although price is higher for that particular Canon.L110 is a stylish piece of equipment and an ergonomic one: I can easily operate it with only one hand.The menu is really simple and intuitive... even for the feminine intuition... :)All in all, a great camera and some well spent money.", "Date": "February 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome little point and shoot!!!", "Author": "Studio Rayne", "ReviewID": "R37TWU0FS0BTQB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an awesome little point and shoot camera.I purchased it because I needed something that would take really nice photos but could be easily slipped into my handbag whilst on vacation. My DSLR and lenses are a little bulky to be lugging around all day.My first choice after reading tons of reviews was the Canon SX20, mainly because I really didn't want to sacrifice a viewfinder, plus it had the HD video capability. But I have to get a hands on the product first and no stores in our area had one in stock.When I found the L110 was just being released I decided to give it a go....I have to admit I am impressed....this is a neat little camera. I've read some reviews where people are dissapointed that there aren't any manual settings, but the many preset features are really good for just about all conditions.One feature that I really like is the smart portrait setting - the camera will automatically shoot the pic when it detects a smile. This feature helped me get some of the cutest photos of our baby nephew. When I was trying on plain auto mode I missed the smile every time. Theres also a setting that will let you know if someone blinked with a pop up on screen warning. This certainly helps avoid those *would've been a great pic if only you hadn't blinked* photos that you notice hours after the event.As for digital zoom...I don't really like it on any camera...so chances are I won't use it unless absolutely necessary. But, I did try it out and found that using the full zoom capabilities you can get a pretty impressive photo of the moon, craters and all :o) (I'll post a photo I took of the moon with the L110) I did need to use a tripod though, because at that power zoom the camera shake was pretty bad. But it could be just me, I don't have the steadiest of hands.I also love that I can record HD video, even indoors in low light it's not really that bad when played on a HD TV. Outdoors in natural light it is pretty impressive. However, its not intended to replace a stand alone video camera so don't expect Hollywood results. Oh and the mic isn't ideally placed, but thats probably to minimize the recording of the lens movement when zooming (it already picks up on it so avoid zooming if possible)All in all its a great camera and I didn't really find any real cons to it. It definitely isn't a *pocket* camera, but its not bulky either, somewhere in the middle I'd say.Oh and as for battery life.....using either the optional recommended Nikon rechargeables, or the included energizer ultimates you won't be dissapointed, I just can't seem to get either of them to run out of power.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Kirk's 2nd Nikon try", "Author": "K.

Price was OK at $185 but right from the start the picture quality was poor and camera did not work right.  It finally quit working 92 days after purchase.  Thankfully, Amazon let me return it as they had none in stock for replacement.  I then reviewed the NIKON L110 12MP 15x zoom and even though it was nearly $100 more than the L100 I got it.  Let me tell you, the L110 is really a pleasure to use and the pictures are GREAT.  I can not believe the differance and although its alittle pricey for a point and shoot its well worth it.  From day one I was taking great indoor shots even in low light.  The flash works great.  The video is cool as camera has stereo speakers.  If the L100 ever is avaiable again PLEASE don't buy it.

Anderson", "ReviewID": "RX99DYESK538B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you want to move up from a pocket size point and shoot camera to one with a 15X zoom, this is a good choice.  The picture quality equals many point and shoot cameras, and the 15X zoom and anti-shake features allow you a great deal more flexibilty.  Without casting any negativity on reviewers who gave unfavorable ratings, I can only assume that they didn't set the camera on 'auto mode' which does permit you to set the flash mode, and allows some white balance compensation.  You can also pick Nikon's preset camera modes, but 'auto mode' works best.  Does the picture quality equal a digital slr camera? Of course not.  Are the quality of pictures equal to my Canon SD1000 point and shoot? Yes.  Is it priced like a 15X zoom digital slr? No.The camera's viewfinder/playback screen is one of the camera's other highlights.  It has a very high pixel count and is the same as one used on Nikon's higher priced digital camera.  The HD video recording approaches that of a mid priced HD camcorder.  I had NO problems playing back HD movies on any of my HD TVs, and I don't understand the complaints about poor picture quality, bad flash pictures, and poor HD video. I can only assume people didn't understand the directions, which aren't the best, left the camera in 'easy mode', which is how it is set out of the box, or they got defective units and simply should have exchanged them.  While this camera probably isn't exceptional in any one category, it performs very well across almost all categories and is a steal in the performance vs price segment.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for stills, but not for video", "Author": "E.

You may encounter some mild pumping from the auto focus. Nikon tells you upfront that shoot times are limited and there's a meter on the LCD with the remaining record time.Having a stereo microphone seems pointless if it's not pointing at the camera's subject - it's mounted on top, aiming upwards.

I have always had Nikons--over 25 years worth from a manual to an SLR to digital to this one!--and once again I can take pictures straight out of the box. It feels good in your hand, the controls are so easy and the photos are crystal clear. I have only had it for short while, so I have not tried out the video but I didn't buy the camera for video capabilities so I may not ever use it! I have yet to read the book but I will so I can take some creative shots.I broke the LCD screen on my Nikon CoolPix L15 (don't ever put them in your purse without a case!) so I initially thought I'd get another one like it until I saw the L110. The 15x zoom is absolutely wonderful, esp for taking wildlife shots, which is what I was lacking with the L15's 3x zoom.I wanted a Nikon L-series camera because it uses regular AA batteries (comes with 4 Energizer Lithiums!) which you can find anywhere, esp on vacation.The camera strap and lens cap strap that come with it are great--the lens cap strap is threaded with the camera strap so you cannot lose it, which is very nice, yet it is out of the way.I've taken quite a few macro shots both on the \"upclose\" setting and on the standard \"portrait\" setting and both work beautifully.The absolute ONLY thing I'd change on the camera is to color in that glowing orange dot for the record button--it makes you think the camera is \"on\".So far I haven't had any blurry pictures issues like some of the reviews here....", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is a great camera!", "Author": "K.

I loved the fact that it was a step in between an SLR and an Instamatic. The 15x Optical Zoom on a camera at this price is tantalizing. But the simple fact is that, like other reviewers, I couldn't get this camera to take a good photo. The pre-set scenes didn't seem sufficiently useful. I didn't like that you had to flip through menus to bring them up which is too time consuming for point-and-shoot. And you pretty much had to be shooting from a tripod to get a non-blurred photo. The color is extremely disappointing. The useability leaves something to be desired. The Vibration Reduction is worthless.I bought this camera to replace my Canon PowerShot SD780IS. But that camera took way better pictures. The color was brighter and I didn't have to be a robot to get a non-blurred image. So I exchanged the L110 for Canon's version of the same thing, the PowerShot XS130IS. Of course, that camera only has 12x zoom rather than 15x, but the set back in zoom is a worthy price to pay for better photo taking. In fact, the PowerShot XS130IS is much more usable than the L110 - it can go fully manual, it has a setting where you set the aperture and the camera determines the shutter speed or vice versa. Plus it has many more pre-set scenes than the L110. It has better face recognition than the L110. The color is much more vivid, especially when shooting in \"vivid\" mode. Best of all, Canon's Image Stablizing software actually works and you can take a crystal clear picture. That's what I missed when I went from my SD780 to the L110. The PowerShot XS130IS is a way better camera for $10 less than the L110. Some say the L110 takes good photos if you know what you're doing. Here's the simple facts: (1) I couldn't get the L110 to take a good photo in any condition and I was able to take better photos with my SD780; (2) the PowerShot XS130 has triple the capability (again, it goes fully manual) and yet is still suited for quick, point-and-shoot photography. So, the PowerShot XS130 in my opinion is a true hybrid between the SLR and the Instamatic - I can take my time and have full control over the camera when I have the time and I can go fully instamatic when I'm just wanting everyday photos.", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for the money", "Author": "Brian S.

A clueless camera!", "Author": "Azom S.", "ReviewID": "RWRFNICHKMIY8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am a Nikon guy and love my D90. I bought this L110 camera for my sister expecting great things from Nikon.First of all, this is not a camera that you start to shoot out of the box and expect great pictures. My first use was at night-time indoor light. To be frank, the camera was completely CLUELESS about the surrounding environment, even in Auto and Easy Auto modes. It would not use flash (with the flash raised) and would use a long exposure to take picture of the room (as if I am trying to photograph night landscape on a tripod!). And that means, blurry picture. The other point and shoots that I like, would know that it needed to use the flash and fast shutter speed in this condition.The Portrait mode (with red-eye turned off) eventually did the trick for me in low light conditions. In this mode, camera uses flash and proper shutter speed. But, every time I turn the camera on in Portrait mode, the red-eye reduction will automatically turn on (and pictures are not so good with that). So, I will have to disable red-eye every time I turn on the camera. And, yes, I will have to raise the flash too!This camera takes decent picture in daylight or on a tripod at lowlights... but, so does some really cheap brandless point and shoots. Not sure how Nikon decided to market this product. Mine is going back. Probably is going to settle for Samsung ZS7 or Canon 780IS.BTW. This camera looks and feels great!

Of all the cameras I've ever used, the Nikon L110 is the most dissapointing. When I took the camera outside and shot still photos of birds and flowers, they came out beautifully. However, when trying to shoot pictures of my one year old in my house, images were consistenly coming out blurry and nothing I did fully remedied the problem. Some of the people who have given this camera positive reviews have suggested that perhaps those getting blurry images did not have it in auto mode, were not adjusting the white balance, etc. All I can say is that I tried all those things and more, went through the manual and read about all the features but could not find any setting that completely remedied the problem.The bottom line is when your toddler is doing something cute, you do not have time to scroll through menus adjusting various functions. To me, auto mode suggests that the camera automatically finds the best setting and takes the picture. The worst part is that, there is another setting called \"easy auto\" that is supposed to do just that, but when I tried it the results were even worse. Sitting five feet away from my son in his high chair eating peas, with all the lights on, and the images were so blurry as to be unusable.A few other features were also annoying enough to mention: the lens cap is a seperate piece that you have to manually place on the lens rather than it automatically being covered when you turn the camera off. Ditto with the flash, you have to manually pop it out for flash pictures. And although some people might prefer this, I think its worth mentioning that it takes AA batteries rather than having a rechargeable unit (which is what I prefer- saves money and rechargeables have a longer life).", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "A step up from the point and shoot", "Author": "LunaNik", "ReviewID": "R1SZ01CSY6R51A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera mainly to take higher quality pics of my four kids.

Waste of money.Easy Auto has never produced a good picture for me.  The shutter is always too slow and the light horrible.  The only time you can consistently get a good picture out of this camera is in natural light, which is nothing special for any camera.You cannot adjust the shutter speed, and the shutter is always too slow.  The closest you can get to adjusting the shutter speed is by adjusting the ISO, which still doesn't make much of a difference.It takes minutes of adjusting settings, white balance, light settings, ISO settings before the camera is even close to the right condition for shooting.Time between shots is really slow until you turn on the sports continuous mode.The flash is also a pain.  Just flipping it up will not turn it on.  You have to go into two menus and put it into flash setting besides flipping the flash up manually.The LCD screen is difficult to see in the sunlight, and of course, there is no view-finder.The zoom is really touchy.  You can never zoom just a little because of the huge range.The only thing I've liked about this camera is the battery life.  I have taken over 300 photos, left my camera on forever and taken videos too, but the batteries are still not even half-drained.Overall, I think this camera is meant to be an easy point-and-shoot with ridiculous amounts of zoom and no manual controls.

Amazon has a better price, but even for the price I paid it is a great value.  I wanted to buy a digital SLR but found they were a little more than I wanted to pay right now, but I needed a camera with more zoom than my pocket point and shoot.  I have a daughter in high school dance company and needed a camera that could take quality pictures of her when she is dancing on the football field or in the gym at a pep rally.  The Nikon L110 does the job nicely.  I got good, clear, crisp pictures of her on the field and in the gym. I also got some great video. The sound could be better though.  It might be better hooked up to the TV.  After reading some bad reviews on low light performance, I went around the house and took pictures without the flash, using different modes, trying to get a bad one and couldn't.  I even took a picture of my dog in a fairly dark room and got a decent image.  I also got a great shot of the moon without even using a tripod.  Other reviews complained of not having a manual mode or a viewfinder, but for me this is not a problem.  I'm not a good enough photographer to worry about that.  But I did see that the Nikon P100 has a mode for that if you are into it, and it's about $100 more.  So for the price, this is a great camera.  I'm thinking that the people with bad reviews might have just gotten a defective camera.  All in all, I think this is a great camera and a great price.Update:  I have ended up returning the camera for the Canon SX20is.  This Nikon still did take good pictures and great video,especially outside and inside in good light, but I found I wanted a little more control, as I am taking a photography class at the local college and wanted to learn more than what this camera has to offer.  Also, I began to experience what some other reviewers had issue with - after a few shots it will just freeze up and you can do nothing until you turn the camera off and then back on again.  Also, although only once, I turned the camera on and had a purple screen.  It would not go away until I turned it off and then back on again.  Also in comparison to the Canon - the colors on the screen were not as true and the Canon's.  But if you are looking for a point and shoot that is better than the compacts, this is still the one.Pros:  Camera not heavy at all, feels good in the hand  Large, bright LCD screen, I like that it takes AA batteriesCons:  Freezes up, sports mode only goes to 3mp, but does take pics fairly fast.Look for my review on the Canon SX20 IS", "Date": "November 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "READY RED CAM!", "Author": "LOW-LUMBAR", "ReviewID": "RN0ZR1V8KKJZC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "VERY EASY TO USE COMBINES FEATURES THAT MAKE SHOOTING FUN AGAIN!

Almost all cameras will take good outdoor pics during daylight and the L110 is no different. So far all my outdoor daytime pics have turned out clear and crisp with natural color. I've been pleased with the night pics I've taken, even when it's pitch black the flash brightens up the shot nicely so long as the subjects are close enough for the focus light to illuminate.2. Outdoor video looks good considering it's coming from a point n shoot camera and not a designated camcorder.Indoors:1. Like most cams it needs to fire flash in order to get clear pics with standard, indoor lighting. It has an Easy-Auto and Auto mode that will usually get the settings right, no manual mode though.2. Indoor video isn't impressive if the lighting is poor, especially if the camera or subject is moving very much. Having said that, the vid quality is better than most other point n shoot camera's video mode that I've seen.Pros:1. Price is good for features2. Takes good pics and video is reasonable for a point n shoot camera3. AA batteries are cheap, easy to find, and last a long time in this camera4. Nikon's Easy Auto Mode will have your grandma taking good pics5. Zoom is powerful (15x zoom)6. Camera firmware is easy to understand and responds fairly quickly7. Large 3\" LCD8.

Takes HD 720P 30fps video, perfect for YouTubers wanting to do their vlogs in HDCons:1. No manual mode (AE priority, etc), only auto modes2. Both Sports mode and Multi Shot 16 are nearly useless since the L110 drops the image quality down and turns the ISO up which makes the pics very grainy, especially in low light3. An integrated lens cap (like my Optio 555) would have been very nice4. No matter how large your memory card, you can only take 29min of video at a time (you can take multiple 29min vids though)5.

I prefer the PC setting for picture quality and with this setting for pictures the 8 GB SD card will hold over 10,000 pictures.  If you choose the 16x9 setting you will have considerably less storage on your SD Card, though that will still allow you well over 2,000 pictures.I love the zoom on the camera, 15x times is great!I am at the moment using my Energizer rechargeable batteries; however the Ultimate Lithium disposable batteries are the way to go!  When I have been to a race or other event, I usually have a fresh set in the camera as well as a backup set in case the batteries in the camera go dead.  As long as you have a fresh set in the camera you should be fine for a no less than a few days even if you were to use it strictly for making videos.  I just try to have an extra set of batteries with me for any kind of special event, just my personal preference.If you are only taking pictures, the batteries will last you quite some time!  For just picture taking, the Energizers will last at least 2-3 months or more.  If you are using the camera for videos, your battery life will decrease more as compared to photos only.  I have yet to fully test how long the Ultimate Lithium Batteries would last doing just videos non stop - though I would guess 3 days would be a safe bet (and  I would guess longer).  You can do videos up to 27 minutes at length at a time, which the camera will record in the default HD 720p Resolution.  As with taking pictures, the proper lighting is important for videos if you want them to be clear.  Background noise can be a problem as the mic picks up EVERYTHING, so try to keep that in mind if you are making a video and you want the audio to be heard clearly.I am not as familiar with a rechargeable battery pack for the camera, though there is a DC port on the side of the camera.  The DC allows you to charge a battery pack.  I have not used a battery pack or charger, though I feel comfortable in saying they won't last as long the Energizers anyways.  I am only referring to the Energizer batteries in this review as they are the only brand I have tried besides sometimes regular AA batteries (the regular batteries DO NOT last long at all - do not depend on them to last, go with the Energizer Ultimate Lithium if you want a battery you can count on).  The Energizer rechargeable batteries I use typically do not last very long, usually as long as regular AA batteries before having to be recharged.To maximize the battery life, you need to set the camera for what type of battery you put into it.  The options are:-Alkaline (Regular AA)-Coolpix (Ni-MH) (Rechargeable)-Lithium (Lithium, such as the ones I recommended, or your preferred Brand.)While I own an 8GB SD card for my Camera and it should be more than enough for what I need for the life of the Camera, this camera can accommodate up to a 16GB SD Card.As for options, this camera has quite a few!  I usually use the auto setting for most pictures, though you can choose from several different manual options which may work better for the more advanced user.  I usually like to take Standard color photos though you also have the option of Vivid color, Black-and-white, Sepia, and Canotype.I honestly have only read the instruction book two or three times, so this Camera is ideal for the more novice or beginner such as me that enjoys using the camera and figuring out the different features on my own.One other item worthy of mention is there is a tripod attachment opening on the bottom of the camera, the tripod is sold separately unless of course you buy a package which includes one (as well as the SD Card is sold separately).  It's been a while since I bought my Camera, though I don't think it came with any batteries either.  You would also have to buy a rechargeable battery pack as well or purchase a kit that includes the battery pack and charger.In conclusion, this is a great Camera that will work well for just about anyone!  The only limitations I can think of are of course you can not add or change different lenses or the flash - this camera is an all-in-one unit.  However, that is one of the reasons I bought this camera.  As for the video feature I was only looking for a camera that took great pictures, the video feature was only an added bonus for me.  The feature however could be ideal for someone looking to make shorter videos for YouTube or just to send someone a video of your children, pets, etc.The links I have included are for examples only.  You may like these items, though you may prefer a different brand.  I suggest using whatever quality brand you prefer.  There are many other brands available for different needs and preferences.PNY Optima 8GB SDHC Class 4 Flash Memory Card P-SDHC8G4-EFEnergizer Ultimate L91BP-4 Lithium AA Batteries, Pack of 4 BatteriesEnergizer Value Charger with AA Rechargeable Batteries..

(However some people may prefer the original default factory settings and your camera should still work just fine if you don't want to bother with the firmware update.)  To update the firmware, go to Nikon's website or put \"Nikon L110 Firmware update\" in a search engine such as Google, Yahoo, or Bing for example.  Download the firmware onto the SD Card you will be using with the Camera before you start to take any pictures.

I keep mine in auto and pay attention to the shutter speed, if it becomes red then you need to raise the flash or change it to the proper scene mode. as for the problem with taking photos in max zoom.... i just walk closer to the object. over all i like this camera a lot and again if your looking for a cheap SLR alternative, nothing beats an SLR except a better SLR.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Grainy photos", "Author": "Freebie", "ReviewID": "R3M2MUEU0DUFAK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had the Nikon L110 for several months now and I still don't like this camera.

I am a point and shoot, basic photographer. My subjects are my 4 year old daughter and my pets. However, I also like to take pictures of the hawks that frequent my yard.  The Canon had a hideous shutter lag, just awful! And the picture quality wasn't keeping up with the demands of online photography products, like Christmas cards.  The shutter issue sent me to a Nikon product but I wanted a camera with great zoom.  I read a lot of reviews and decided the Coolpix L110 was the best choice for me.  Reviewers who are much better and knowledgable photographers have found this camera mediocre.  Well I don't.  I'm still figuring it all out but I'm very pleased with my purchase so far.  My number 1 concern was this camera would be too technically difficult for me to use.  Not true.  It has 2 auto functions, an easy auto and auto.  I had to watch a You Tube video  or two to figure my way around quickly.  I will read the directions but who wants to do that as soon as they open the box?  You want to take a picture first! The zoom is outstanding!  The picture quality is equally impressive.  There is a sports setting and I tried to get some motion shots of my daughter at her first dance lesson but all the photos blurred.  I'm sure it's me, not the camera but I say that to point out that there is a learning curve.  As you can see plainly from the pic of the camera, you are giving up easy portability with the camera - the only purse this camera will fit in is a large tote type bag, so my cross body purse leaves me out of luck.  However, the features of the camera outweigh the convenience of being able to put the camera in a shirt pocket. I have not tried the video feature on this camera yet.  We have a Flip, so that was not a  primary reason for purchase.  It's nice that it's there and I'm sure I'll try eventually but I can't weigh in on the quality of the feature.  I had to have the red one, from a purely female point of view.  wink wink).  And it is pretty.  Very happy and don't let all the features scare you away if you're a rank amateur.8 mos of experience later....  Well...I still like the camera but I have found some short falls.  The sports/motion setting creates grainy photos.  The auto settings are awful, you must use the other settings.  I like the wide array of choices for specific conditions and most settings are good.  The video function is minimal at best - 30 seconds is all I've managed to get.  The video is great, just too short. I'm bound and determined to make this camera work but it frustrates my husband.18 mos later and back from WDW.  I brought a back up camera in case this one gave me agita but I left all others in the hotel.  I am pleased with the quality of the vacation photos and many have complimented. I am updating this review because I find fault with one aspect of my 8 mos later review.  The easy auto is a good setting.  This camera is still very motion sensitive which doesn't help when your main subject is 5.5 years old.  You have to make sure the crosshairs are on your subject because the background sometimes comes out less focused.  So if I'm photographing birds and the crosshairs focus on the feeder instead of the bird, I've got clear feeder, blurry bird. Easy auto fixes this to a degree.

I primarily needed a camera to take pictures of the guitars I make and the cars I work on.  That being said, an SLR is a little overkill for what I am using this camera for.Pros - The image stabilizer makes it easy to use zoom and get a decent photo without using a tripod.  I've been able to get some very nice looking pictures both from all sorts of ranges.  I love the macro setting because I can really show off some of the fine details of my cars/guitars.  The LCD screen is also very nice and the zoom works great.Cons - I hate that you have to raise the flash manually.  I'm sure I will get used to it over time but my Fujifilm S1800 had a nifty little button that would pop the flash up by itself.  The biggest disappointment for me is that there's no view finder.  I found it easier to hold the camera steady if you can rest it against your face.  The S1800 also had a view finder.As you can see, I used to own a Fujifilm S1800 and you may think I liked it better than the L110.  Well, let's just say that the cons of the L110 are the only pros of the S1800.  I was not satisfied with the quality of pictures I was getting with the S1800 and then discovered that a close friend also owned an L110.

I don't.  In fairness, it has many nice features which other reviewers have commented on.  The lens is unbelievable and getting 15x physical zoom on a camera this price is incredible, plus the image stabilization is very good and you can get clear shots without a tripod even at 15X.  The macro mode is very good although it occasionally gets confused with focusing and you can't get all the way in to the much-ballyhooed .4\", but still, superb closeups are quite possible.  There are many other nice features that other reviewers have commented upon.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the performance of this camera in low-light conditions stinks.  I would say if you shoot primarily outdoors, you should seriously consider this camera.Unfortunately, I don't.  I bought this camera primarily to shoot indoor pictures for eBay and a good macro mode was mandatory.  Unfortunately, pretty much any indoor picture qualifies for \"low-light\" unless you use the flash, which I don't because on this or any camera it gives pictures a very cold color balance.  My big, big complaint is that when you snap a shot, the colors of the picture you take come out differently than it looks on the screen.  This makes it impossible to decide what settings to use prior to taking the shot.  Trying to get the right colors on a picture becomes a matter of trial and error.  You shoot a picture, then you look at it, it's not right, you try a different setting, and go through the process all over again.  It's an arduous process if you have a still subject and are trying to achieve a certain look.  I find the built-in modes to be confusing and it's unclear what effect they will really have on the final picture, so once you start playing around with the modes, you are again back in the trial and error situation.  I wanted a camera that would take good pictures without much effort, and for the situation I am in, this is NOT the camera.  Outdoors where there's plenty of light and the zoom will be a lifesaver, it's a great camera.  But indoors, my wife has an Olympus Stylus that shoots reliably great pictures the first time with little effort (and it has an incredible macro mode too).  I'm sorry I got this camera.  It seems nice but for me it was ultimately disappointing and a huge time-waster.***** UPDATE *****Well, several months later and I have gotten quite good at finagling good pictures out of this camera indoors.  The white-balance function is the most important.  For indoor pictures, the \"fluorescent\" and \"incandescent\" modes seem quite effective in generating realistic colors under the appropriate light sources.  I generally have to avoid the \"auto\" white-balance because it often changes its mind about what the appropriate white-balance is from one picture to the next, and it can cause consecutive pictures of the same subject to come out differently. On some occasions when none of the built-in white-balance modes seem to work right, the \"auto\" sometimes seems to do the trick, so I do use it a little.The other thing that helps a lot is the exposure function.  Apparently they figured out that this was a crucial function people would have to mess with a lot to get good pictures out of their camera, so they gave it its own control directly on the back panel. I shoot a lot of pictures against a black background, and the subject consistently comes out overexposed unless I reduce the exposure significantly.So, basically I've learned to fiddle with the white balance and the exposure every time I shoot pictures for an auction, because different subjects often require different settings.  I stay away from \"smart auto\" mode because it's not so smart as they wish it was.  And I do get some great pictures out of the thing now.  It wasn't worth the hundred hours of headbanging, hairpulling, reading the manual, and experimenting at great length, to get to this point.  So for shooting outdoors, buy this camera.

I bought three sets of rechargeable batteries-they're much cheaper than buying a replacement battery for a camera that doesn't take regular batteries. Run out of rechargeable batteries and you don't have your charger with you? You can buy a set of AA for cheap anywhere and you're saved. Haven't used the video feature yet, but I have seen some videos others have made with it and the quality is excellent.", "Date": "March 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nikon L110 - Good for Bloggers", "Author": "Jennifer Ngan", "ReviewID": "R2HD4APHXZDLBM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this Nikon L110 camera at the end of December so I can use it to enjoy festivities with my family AND to replace my old Canon SD400 point and shoot camera. I have been very satisfied with it and used it many times for pictures.In terms of ease of use with navigation, the Nikon L110 is extremely easy to use and the option mode has enough features to let you explore different types of finishes (auto, black and white, portrait, etc). Once you get used to the Nikon options screen, it will be very easy to navigate through the features. I give it a 10/10 for navigation ease.As for the features of the camera, it is a bit above your traditional point and shoot because of the zoom lens. Beside looking like a DSLR camera, the fundamentals of the L110 is similiar to a traditonal point and shoot, but with better quality. I recommend reading the manual and blogs to get the most out of this camera because you can execute great quality images if you play around with the ISO speeds. I do a lot of macro shots since I'm a blogger and with the right lighting, your pictures will look great. It would be nice to change the aperture speeds, but I don't believe you can. I give the features a definite 8/10.I have not tested the video feature yet, but I do remember that it makes a humming noise when you reply. I'm not sure if this is because the camera is so sensitive, it captures air (crazy, right?) or it's just how it is. I wasn't too crazy about the battery part. It just seems kind of cheap to not have a charger pack for it, but over time I can see how convenient it can be if you ever need to replace them.In terms of value, it is an amazing value for what you get. I originally bought this camera for $199 on sale at Staples, and I bought the \"bundle\" that went with it (camera bag, mini tripod, insurance for $40) and a memory card for $5 (2 gig), and I felt like I had all that I needed to have and it was a great investment for me because I can take quality pictures without having to splurge on a DSLR camera, especially since blogging is merely a hobby.Overall, this is nice lightweight camera that is portable and very easy to use. It stems above a tradtional point and shoot but picture quality is in the same range if you're not careful. It does tend to blur if you're not using flash, so it's best to have a steady hand when using. I really do like this camera a lot, and I'm still on the experimenting stage with it as I use this camera to capture objects in different lighting, surroundings, etc.Overall: 9/10If you want to look at pictures, head to my blog to check to them out.[...]All images after Jan 2011 were captured with the Nikon L110.", "Date": "March 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Michele", "ReviewID": "R25LYU1WPPZFA9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a reasonably priced camera with at least a 15x zoom and this camera fits the bill.

It takes fabulous pictures and at 12.1 megapixels, you can enlarge your photos to just about any size. The 15X zoom is nifty as well. The macro feature works pretty well, but you have to get pretty close for the autofocus to work. That can make shooting insects difficult (but not impossible though). There are many shooting modes like Sport, Landscape, Smart Portrait, and....you get the idea. The only mode that is missing is Manual mode, which may be a major con to some, but the only complaint I have is that you can't take time lapse shots due to lack of ability to change the shutter speed manually. I use my old camera for that. Oh well. For $200 I won't let that sour me to this camera (my old camera actually cost more). A minor con is that the flash doesn't flip up by itself when needed. The camera tells you to raise it, but I've found that it's just easier to raise it from the beginning. It just takes getting used to. No big deal. The last minor con is that the 3\" LCD screen automatically shuts down after only 20 seconds or so and takes a few seconds to come back up when you hit a button. I missed a few shots due to that in the beginning, but I just started pressing the shutter button half way down periodically so I don't miss as many opportunities. There is no eyepiece or viewfinder on this camera either. You point and shoot through the LCD screen. I was worried about that, but I find that it hasn't effected my pictures at all. The screen is bright and clear. I found the neck strap to be limiting considering that you'll want the camera off your neck due to the point and shoot nature of it. I ditched it and spent ten bucks on a DSLR wrist strap. It's soooo much easier. I can't comment on the video feature because I haven't used it and have no intention of using it. I have a camcorder for that. LOL. The battery life is FANTASTIC! I use Energizer Ultimate lithiums (it takes 4) and I've shot over 800 shots and just got my first battery warning today.

The pics came out blurry and grainy and I missed some great shots because of trying to figure out why it wasn't working like I think it should have.

One other little gripe I have with this camera was mentioned by someone else who reviewed this, to view photos you have to take the lens cap off, otherwise it will pop off.  I am now trying to find a point and shoot digital camera to purchase so that I will have a decent one to use when my granddaughter arrives in a week.  Like I mentioned before the zoom is great and it does have the capacity to take wonderful pics, but you really have to become accustomed to it so you know how to hold it, etc.  I was very impressed with the sport mode on this camera, it takes great action shots, one right after the other when you hold the button down. And I feel it is a great camera for the money. But, if you want a camera that you can just grab and shoot though, go with a compact digital.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good hybrid camera", "Author": "sandyT", "ReviewID": "R1PCEBBLCLZDIW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a nice looking middle of the line product.

Its easy to get around the menus and settings, the zoom is in a nice place, it zooms well getting good shots but you have to have a fairly steady hand or i would suggest buying a tripod because this camera is not so forgiving in that aspect. When you are viewing a picture of something shiny like jewelry (or the sun), that has a bit of glare it has these lines of rainbow color vertical on the viewing screen. When you take the photo and are looking at it no lines are visible, the picture looks perfect. There is no view finder like the older style cameras have, which i would have liked.I like the variety of photo settings, there are the usual like landscape, sport, portrait but they added some unexpected ones like food and panorama assist for a panoramic view of say a wide sunset.

I was looking for a good size digital camera that will shoot good quality pictures as well as withstand the rigors of parental handling.  I'm glad to say that the L110 did not disappoint.  The \"scene\" selection feature took the guesswork out of the mix.  I actually have fun finding the best setting for indoor, outdoor and different weather and environmental situations.The weight and size of this camera helps me keep my shots steady.  The size of the base helps when it comes to using the timer.  I can easy place it on an even surface and run.  This is something I can't accomplish quickly with the small, dainty digital cameras.  The size of the LCD, lens and bulk also lends itself to a tripod.The best surprise for me was the quality of the video and sound I get from the L110.  I'm a professional TV producer and have used my share of highend broadcast cameras.  Let's just say I'm picky when it comes to video.  Again, for the price I paid, the video yield is excellent.  I just shot a video of my child's concert last night under indoor gym lights and it came out great.  The plus was the sound.  I really wish this camera had an audio output for a headset and a mic input.  But that's asking too much for the price.Of couse, it's not perfect.  The only gripe I have is the placement of the SD card slot in the battery compartment at the base.  It becomes a little cumbersome to remove and insert an SD card. But this is not a deal-breaker for me.

I currently have a Canon A510 compact which I've had for about 5 years.  Its a great little camera but with only a 3X zoom and 3.2 MP, I felt as if I was missing out on some great pictures. To be honest, I'm not a professional photographer but I like taking vacation photos and lots of pictures and little videos of my grandchildren.After doing some research, I narrowed my search down to the Nikon L110 and the Canon SX130IS.  I really liked the Nikon L110 mainly because of the 15X zoom and 12.1 MP. About 2 weeks ago, I purchased the red Nikon L110 but returned it back to the store when I realized that someone had owned the camera before I did because all the settings were already in place and the batteries were missing.  I initially wanted to exchange it for one that hadn't been used but there were none left so I just got a refund.Today I went into Costco and much to my surprise, they were selling the L110 with a 4GB SD card and a camera case for very low price of $159.99 so I bought it again.  After setting it up I took some shots and they came out pretty good.  I even took some video which came out OK too.I am very happy with this camera because I realized that I could read camera reviews from now till eternity and will always read something bad about each and every one.  I decided to buy a camera that was in my price range that had the features I was looking for.  The Nikon L110 fits the bill perfectly.  Its a great looking point and shoot camera, is very responsive, and it's simple to operate.The only thing that I can fault on this camera is that you can definitely hear the clicking sound when you are zooming in and out while shooting video.  Since I have a separate compact video camera, this was not a deal breaker.

I went right outside to test it on our dog and get some shots of our daugther, neither of them would stay still of course so i just messed around with the settings and figured they probably wouldn't turn out all that good the first time but i was wrong they turned out great, i zoomed in and took one of our dog running at me and it's so cute not even blury, i'm very happy with this little camera it's great! :)", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Missed the mark for me", "Author": "MuxDux", "ReviewID": "RONAEKKNJBKE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I read the manual from front to back and took several hundred pictures with this camera over the weekend. The burst mode is quite good, something like 10 shots a second at low resolution. It seems like I barely dented the battery capacity with the included lithium AAs. Those were definitely pluses.However, 95% of the photos were noticeably blurry, even without any zoom, on the AUTO and EASY AUTO presets. I adjusted the ISO and \"scene\" settings and got an unacceptably small level of improvement, along with considerable degradation in image quality.Subjects sitting down five feet from the camera came out inexplicably blurred, looking like they were about to make the leap to hyperspace, even with a flash. These were shots I thought were the simplest possible. Now perhaps there is some arcane tweak to the L110 settings I could have made to improve the results, but I tried.In the more demanding zoomed pictures, I expected some blur, and got it. My reaction was a big fat MEH. Perhaps with more practice those shots could be improved. But here's the tradeoff: a tiny Canon pocket point-and-shoot already works fine for 80% of the pictures I want to take. It would have aced my weekend shots, except for those involving big zoom, or burst mode. I don't see the point of owning a larger camera which is so finicky or ill-suited for basic shots when something smaller and simpler does the job better. And the successful zoom shots from the L110 were not that great anyway.Overall, I was underwhelmed. This L110 missed the mark and I sent it back (easily through Amazon). For about $20 more I'm buying a Panasonic Lumix model a year or two old but that gets consistently rave reviews.

The flashbar must be manually raised, a mixed blessing, taking time to start shooting, yet, for novices, the lack of an auto-pop-up flashbar means that the automatic mechanism won't be broken, by accidentally holding it down, when it wants to pop-up. Also, the lens cap must be removed before powering on, since the lens extends right away, right out to about an inch from the lens cap ring.The Clarity and detail are very noticable. In highest resolution mode, a class 10 SD memory can get 20 frames in one second. I expected to be held back to a lower resolution mode, for this shot mode. I haven't tried sport-continuous, as stated in the features, resolution has to be lowered, for that shot mode.I just like the way it l00ks. Red is great. Deep red colour, and a metallic glossy deep red at that. The Camera has the air of an expensive one, and flair, point and shoot nature, and with the Nikor lens and optics, I've gotten some pictures I've been unable to get with other cameras.I remember other cameras I've had, that I allowed a friend to use, to shoot something, and upon telling them to please not touch the lens, that's exactly what they seem to do, by human nature, so the L110 is my baby, not to be used by anyone else, barring another afficionado to photography.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very nice!", "Author": "Carmen A.", "ReviewID": "R3RTSUFOI2UEPL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my daughter for Christmas, and she's enjoying it a lot.

Sometimes it will overexpose the picture because apparently it needs some time to process the lighting conditions before \"deciding\" what to do with the flash.  It's odd, and makes you have to do a little more work on your own to get the picture right.  Also, what's up with having to pop up the flash manually?  What a dumb idea! Once you pick it up and shoot a picture you're half expecting the flash to just pop up or just go off....but no, you have to do it yourself.  I had a Konica Minolta Dimage Z20 before this and I think that one was so much more user friendly.All in all, it takes good pictures and videos, obviously, don't forget to buy at least an 8gb memory card.

It's a very good camera, and has survived several tumbles down rocky terrain. It has a lot of features, a very good 45x digital zoom, and it takes nice, sharp photos. It does a really great job in low light. Sometimes it overcompensates and the pictures still come out overexposed, but other than that, it's great.Complaints:* It is slow to recover after taking a photo with the flash. If seconds count, give up. My Canon Powershot never had this problem.* Flash photos drain the batteries really fast. You can take maybe 10 flash photos before the camera shuts down.* It's a bit slow recovering from any shot. Really frustrating for photographing small children or wildlife or anything that moves around a lot. Use the \"sport continuous\" setting if you photograph moving objects often.* Mine has a tendency to \"freeze up\", and I haven't figured out why. Lately I've noticed that it happens after I've taken several photos in quick succession with the zoom in use, especially if I've got the zoom all the way out. The camera just stops responding, and eventually shuts down. It can't be reactivated unless you open the battery compartment, take the batteries out, and put them back in again. Sometimes the camera gets really hot, but not always. If it does, you need to cool off the camera and the batteries. It also happens when the flash card is more than 3/4 full. I can get 750 shots out of my 4gb card, then the camera complains that it has no memory and shuts down. Not usually a problem, except when I'm on vacation and don't have access to a computer to download my photos to.* My pictures often come out overexposed. I've got to reset the exposure level almost all the time, or spend time correcting it with photo editing tools.* The color red usually comes out slightly blurry, or the red object looks fake.* Without a tripod, it's very hard to take a good shot with the zoom all the way out.", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Denis Carvalho Parry", "ReviewID": "R223PVDKWF0JC6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got it many years ago, but only now I have noticed that I hadn't written a review on it yet.

We personally find this annoying and expensive.- If you put it on auto and take pictures without the flash up (even if you dont need it) the shots come out blurry.Overall we are pretty happy with the camera.

I am in agreement with those who suggest using a tripod when the zoom is fully extended.  I only got one clear picture out of five when testing the zoom.  Here's where having a viewfinder would come in handy, but it's not a big enough problem to make me change my mind about the camera.The lcd is bright and sharp, and you can adjust the brightness.

I desperately needed to get an upgrade from my 5 yr old Sony with 4 megapixels so I researched quite a bit about this camera and thought it would be a wise decision without having to buy a digital slr.  Not a wise decision at all!!  I have been so frustrated at how every picture I have taken is blurry.  I even took it on a trip at which point the camera decided to stop all together.  After letting it sit for a couple of months, I decided to try it again.  It would take a picture but still blurry.  No matter what setting I have it on, blurry pictures!!  The menus are awful to navigate through.  Preview mode doesn't stay on when trying to look through pictures.  Just moving the camera takes it out of preview.  I'm definitely looking into a slr now but probably won't even stick with the Nikon series at all.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this camera.", "Author": "Disappointed", "ReviewID": "R3UXGR4AHACX50", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera after reading reviews upon reviews of it.

After 3 days of owning it, hundreds of pictures and about a 3% success rate on getting the shot I was looking for I sent is back for a refund. The camera will not focus in zoom, I dont care who you are or what your taking a photo of it isn't going to happen, the camera will not focus with the macro lens on and the camera close to the subject of the photo. Camera performs horrible in low light conditions as well as any moving show you could want to take. It just did not hold up to the nikon name. Don't buy it.

Nearly all of the pictures I have taken inside are blurry and every one of the pictures that I took using the zoom lens are extremely blurry - just have to be dumped. I frequently need cute pictures on the spur of the moment and by the time this camera is ready, the moment is over. I also have not been able to get the movies I took to play back on the computer. You would also think that my living room was as long as a football stadium because everyone is so far away in the picture. Maybe after I read this 300 page booklet, I will know how to make this thing work better but I will never be satisfied with having to scroll through a menu (baby has already moved) or raising the flash.

The image quality was horrible and to my dismay the camera didn't have a manual mode. Seeing as every normal camera basically has a manual mode I'd forgot to check for it before I'd bought it. The shutter speed was too slow, the pictures too blurred, overexposed, not properly focused, and had too much static. The HD video was so bad our HD TV didn't even want to connect to replay the video for a second time. Now, don't get me wrong, I know what I'm taking about and this camera is not a camera in my view because my Black Berry takes better photos! About the only thing this camera is good for is sitting on a self to look pretty, this camera is shiny when new and reflects the light nicely back at you.All in all, I do NOT recommend this camera unless you don't mind crappy pictures.
