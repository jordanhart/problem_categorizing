{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not horrible, not great", "Author": "Jessica Thompson", "ReviewID": "R1BVU8MTDAHC3X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had high hopes for this camera, but the reality is it is the bottom of the Stylus Tough series. The shutter speed is so slow that by the time the picture is taken the kids have closed their eyes or walked away. The flash is so ridiculous that everything has a white haze around it (that is if it isn't completely washed out). Outdoor pictures are ok, nothing special, the shutter still lags though. I will be calling Olympus with the hopes that my camera was defective and I didn't in fact purchase a low quality product (the only reason I didn't exchange it is because I foolishly didn't test it out until my return period was up, my fault).On the plus side, I LOVE the one touch HD video recording, and of course, waterproof and shockproof make it great for adventures. The built in storage is great too, just in case you run out of space on your card.Hopefully, if my unit isn't defective, as the summer goes on, this camera will grow on me! I've got lots of \"watery\" vacations in store! This camera has lots of potential, no doubt about that, I will continue taking pictures and hopefully post some for others to see.Accessory Recommendations:If you buy this product you will most definitely need an adjustable or floating wrist strap (the one it comes with does not tighten around your wrist, and the camera does not float, obviously). You will also want to buy extra batteries (not too expensive on here) as the battery life is pretty weak. For a pretty low price you can get a good warranty with accidental damage because lets face it, if you buy a shockproof/waterproof/freezeproof camera you're likely an adventurous person, and some adventures could leave you with a busted camera!", "Date": "May 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good choice if you plan to abuse your camera, otherwise, plenty of better choices", "Author": "Surgery100 \"ADJ\"", "ReviewID": "R2A7B8SA17KEDV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Positives:1) submersible in water to 3m (10 feet),2) shockproof3) will work at extreme temperatures (rated to -10C, around 14F)Negatives:1)Extremely slow, takes about 6 seconds from the time that you turn on the camera to when its ready to take the first picture.  The picture to picture time is also a fairly slow 2 seconds.2) Poor quality of indoor pictures, some blurring as it does not focus well in poor light. Also some noise on the indoor pictures without flash.3) LCD is not very bright which can be a problem when trying to compose pictures outdoorsSummary:Very easy to use, the current settings appear on the side of the LCD and they are easy to change. A fairly robust feature set as well as its ruggedness are the main positives. The poor LCD and very slow response times make it hard to recommend as there are better cameras on the market (see Canon A3100 IS for example).  If you need a tough, rugged, camera you'll probably do better with the Panasonic Lumix DMC FT1.

I spent a weekend with it, mostly outdoors, and shot many stills and a few videos as well.  It's getting returned to the store today and I hope to find another 80xx to take it's place.While the feature list of the 3000 reads quite similarly to the more expensive models in this family line this is a camera that really does exemplify the old adage \"you get what you pay for\", in this case, not a lot.  I won't go into great detail about what this camera *should* do; if you are reading this you probably already know that the \"Tough\" line are designed to withstand pretty good shocks, such as an accidental drop onto pavement, and not only be water resistant but truly water PROOF.  I favor the \"Tough\" family of cameras over it's obvious competitors as the Olympus Tough line is also one of the only point and shoot cameras in this class that have mechanical image stabilization, a feature not to be underestimated when shooting action on the go.While no camera of mine is ever likely to be tossed at a rock or anything the 3000 has a cheap, plastic feel to it that makes it easy to imagine shattering into a million pieces if it was even to fall out of a pocket onto concrete or something.  The more expensive models, in contrast, feature a much more solid construction with real metal in it, the 8xxx series even having metal reinforcement in key points (the corners) most likely to take a hit.  Likewise, I don't take my cameras scuba diving but I DO live in the rather rain-prone Pacific Northwest and the seal and hinge arrangement on the 3000 appears on close examination to be almost an afterthought, compared to the higher end models.  Opening the single door that conceals the battery, memory card, and cable ports, you can see that there is very little rubber to make a good water proof seal when the door is closed.  Further the hinge feels weak and even brand new can wiggle a bit when tested.  I'd be afraid to see how long this camera could function if fully submersed on a day to day basis.One thing that I really found distracting was that the 3000 has most of it's controls underneath a pliable plastic shield, something like the \"bubble\" type keys on some old style pocket calculators, television remote controls and even early cell phones, unlike the higher end models which have relatively solid feeling controls made out of metal.  Not only does this give the 3000 a \"cheap\" build feel but I found it irked me that contacting a control with a thumb or fingertip wasn't always the actual control but rather the raised plastic bit above it.  Pressing down just a bit harder then gave the tactile sensation of actually pressing down on a button.  It made quick navigation of the system feel less natural, less intuitive, and quite possibly a bit slower as well.Battery life was shockingly terrible compared to the more expensive models.  None of these cameras are going to keep you rolling all day long on a single charge, especially if you are recording video and/or using the flash a good deal, but this model was the first of it's kind that made me wish I had purchased SEVERAL spare batteries instead of just one.  It ate up the charge like a kid can eat candy!  Maybe 30 seconds of video and 40-50 still shots on a full charge?Last but not least is image quality, which I can't rate any higher than \"Meh.\"  While the 3000 does have a 12 megapixel CCD it is really only good for web based displays.  Anything larger, such as 12\"x print, will reveal lots of chromatic aberration in high contrast areas as well as a lot of noise on any ISO setting above 100, or in just about *any* of the smart modes if you choose not to select your own ISO setting!  Having used some of the higher end models with a similar CCD size, and presumably very similar firmware, my experience with image quality left me feeling suspect that poorer performance had been intentionally built into this model to offset it from the more expensive models in the line up.  Whether that is true or not comparisons to photos I had taken with even the 6020 (only $30 more) revealed in more cases than not that the 3000 was the lowest on the scale of photo quality as well as price.  The flash was OK, not really any worse than any other point and shoot I've used, start up time seemed rather slow, and the auto focus and auto white balance in some of the modes left a good deal to be desired as well.In summary, in general the Olympus Tough line of \"point and shoot\" cameras are a good choice for outdoors photography in less than favorable conditions and the mechanical image stabilization is a real boon at this price bracket... but I have to leave the 3000 with the feeling that perhaps Olympus has gotten too greedy in trying to completely dominate the market.  This model is a poor representation of the entire line and should be skipped in favor of the slightly more expensive (approx. +$30) 6xxx series or the MUCH better (and nearly twice as expensive) 8xxx series. Plan to budget at least one extra battery, preferably two or three even, for an all day adventure, and look for a bundle that includes the separate battery charger as some of the less expensive ones do not.", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Disappointment", "Author": "M.H.I.", "ReviewID": "RPFPIFCH015", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My daughter bought this camera a little over a year ago.  Along with many other reviewers, I agree about the short battery life.  It seemed it needed to be charged all the time.  Also, the camera was very finicky about batteries.  We bought an extra aftermarket battery as a spare and it was tough to get the camera to accept it to charge.  Weird.The worst problem, however, came on our trip to Hawaii in October.  My daughter had taken the camera underwater a few times prior, but when we waded into the ocean and she tried to take a picture, it just fried.  So no underwater photos of the turtles and fish in Hawaii.  Bummer.We thought we were okay, however, since we bought a 2 year extended warranty. Ha.  Just got off the phone.  There was \"extensive corrosion inside all of the camera either due to accident or operator error\" and the warranty doesn't cover that.

The Stylus Tough-3000 takes terrible blurry pictures no matter what settings I put it on.  Also, the low light settings result in VERY grainy and orange tinted pictures no matter what I tried.  Also, the old camera could run for days on end of moderate use (including video recording) without needing to recharge the battery.  The new one only lasts for about 1.5 hours of moderate use before it needs charging.

This compact, and powerful little stylish bubble camera has been the answer to everything that I could possibly ask for.When Digital Camera's first came out onto the market my very first camera I received was a little digital Olympus from my dad as a gift..I bet it was something like 5mega pixels or something - but and I loved it too. I carried the little thing everywhere telling my story in self portraying photographs...Then somewhere along the lines I decided to take a photography course and upgraded to a Minolta DIMAGE A.2. The BEST on the market at that time (this was in 2004). It was 10 mega pixel SLR and I spent $1100 on that camera.... I hated it. I still dont really know how to use it. Not to mention that Minolta has now become extinct - so I couldnt even buy parts if I wanted to. For YEARS I had this Minolta this BiG honkin' piece of machinery.... That I simply hated carrying around...Now its 2010, and it was time for an upgrade. Really I was looking for a new still camera that I could compact with me everywhere I went, but there was a catch. I wanted video capacity and HD preferably... Something Cute, and not to expensive...Then TaDa! This little stylus perked up its little face on Amazon.com. Now the first thing that attracted me to this little Olympus was his price...he was comparably priced at approximately $200, and of course because I once had a Olympus before that I very much loved, we instantly had a connection. Then he continued to tell me about himself...\"I'm waterproof\" he said seductively. \"You can carry me around with you, anywhere, and we will have an amazing time...you'll never have to worry about me because not only am I susceptible to water, up to 3 meters... but I'm also Shockproof\" he said cockily to me. \"I'm a Stylus Tough, and I'm one of a kind.\"How could I not fall in love with such a wonderful little camera?But before I could commit to him; I need to feel him, hold him in my hands and KNOW for sure that he was the one for me. So I looked around looking for my prince charming camera. I met many other camera's in the process... but none of them were stacking up to the stylus that I read about on Amazon.comThen Finally I found him! He came in 4 different colors to choose from, but I knew that I wanted him in Red. The clerk as he was showing him to me, was as charismatic as the camera, and I knew that we were a perfect fit. Today was the day that I getting my new little Olympus Stylus 3000!He was perfect to hold in my hand, and I liked that his lens was not retractable. To me, that was a feature that was less likely to cause me to send him away to the warranty hospital. His buttons on the back are rubberized and soft. Everything about this camera is fun and noninvasive. He has many \"magic\" features, and a wide arrange of capture settings such as `cuisine' and `pets'. My favorite setting is the pinhole, and popart in the magicbox. But you can also stencil and create coloring pages!The only downfall that I have about this little camera is uploading the video. The video feed is only compatible in Quicktime (MP4) and I have to convert all my videos in order to alter them in moviemaking which compromises the quality - quite a bit. And when you are recording video you cannot zoom. you can zoom before you start recording and it will work, but once the red little button has been pushed that's it! no changes missy! and unfortunately the features don't work in video either... so no popart videos :(Besides that, I highly recommend this Powerful little 12mp, Stylus Camera![...] Samantha is a part of what is arguably to be the World's Largest Internet Marketing School available.
