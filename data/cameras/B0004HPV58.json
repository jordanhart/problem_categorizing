This is particularly true for cameras, especially if you want to capture all those spontaneous moments in life. Size therefore plays a major factor.In this camera, Sony proves that size doesn't mean less capability. To be able to pack a 4M pixel camera with 3X optical zoom, and NTSC resolution full motion audio/video capture (with no time limit) in a form factor the size of a candy bar is pure genius.The interface is easy to use. I picked up the camera and started using it without having to read the manual.There are only 3 weaknesses with the camera:1. the microphone is positioned on the top left hand side of the unit so it is easy to cover it up when you are holding the camera to take videos.2. when in video shooting mode, zoom is fixed but autofocus continues to operate.3. flash pictures in dark environments can sometimes yield lens flaring.", "Date": "November 23, 2004"}, {"Title": "Amazing Little Camera", "Author": "M", "ReviewID": "R3TW1678EPPL1I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera and am extremely happy with it.

Pretty easy menu system and the most important functions are readily accessible.  When conditions are right, it takes clear, beautiful photos.  Rechargeable internal battery means you don't spend a fortune in double A's.  LCD screen is a good size.The bad:  Focus problems!! In certain lighting conditions (e.g. fluorescent lights) you cannot take an in focus picture using the automatic setting.  I missed so many potentially great holiday pics of my kids due to fiddling around with the settings.  Mostly, I simply gave up trying to get a clear pic. I finally contacted Sony tech support and they acknowledged the focus problems under certain lighting conditions, including bright sunlight.  They suggested changing the white balance and shutter speed- but when you're a novice photographer, changing these settings is not so intuitive!Bottom line:  Buy a Canon elph.  I wish I had.

I recently sold my Canon SD110, which was an excellent camera but I needed the $$$. This camera I wanted it to be an upgrade, so I went from a 3.2 to a 4 megapixel camera. I am very happy so far.Probably the biggest selling point is the SIZE, Wow! My Canon was a bit thinner, but this is smaller and with more megapixels for 25$ less than my Canon when I bought it new.For me, Canon and Sony are in a dead heat when it comes to consumer friendly/amateur/high resolution/amazingly compact cameras. Canon has a bit of a technical edge because they seem to have more features and better photo quality (probably not discernable to the naked eye). But Sony has the technical edge on simplicity and size. You decide which is best, but both brands are excellent.I am happy so far, and I highly recommend this camera.

I have had this the L1 for over 6 months.  It is so easy to use, and the pictures are magnificent.  The camera was worth every penny. I think that you really pay for the camera's design as the specs are quite average compared to other cameras of the same price.  I am a Sony girl, though, and am willing to pay the extra cash for a high quality product.My only mishap with the camera was with the flash. I set the flash to SL (Slow synchro) not knowing that this setting is for low light which slows the shutter speed.  All of my pictures were horribly blurry!  Thank goodness I dug up the manual and read up on camera's settings.  While I was able to use the camera immediatly after bringing it home, I highly recommend that you take a few moments to look over the advanced settings and the LCD icons in the manual... You never know, it may save you a few moments of confusion someday!I highly recommend this camera.

Unless you're standing very close to your subject in dark environments, your picture will come out dark.However, the other positive features of this camera outweigh that one negative.Because of its size, I can take this camera anywhere.  I've owned cameras before, but since they were larger, I'd never take it with me and thus miss photo opportunities.  I barely notice this one is in my bag.Second, contrary to other reviews, I feel that this camera is fairly durable.  I bought the Sony LCS-LA leather carrying case, which is hard, not soft (as described in Amazon), and I've dropped this camera a few times in this case with no problems.Third, this camera takes BEAUTIFUL daytime pictures.  The colors come out so rich and vibrant.This camera is well worth it for the point-and-shoot consumer.-----Update: I've had this camera for almost two years now, and it's still working great.  I bought the underwater case on Ebay at a discount, tried it in the ocean, and the camera still works fine.  Also, I found a way to strengthen the flash in dark environments.  In the menu, change the environment setting to Program, and then before you take a picture, point the control knob up to change the flash setting until it shows the lightning bolt with the \"+\" sign next to it.

There is so much that I can say about this camera, but I want to keep it down too a minimum.Pros:*Design - Slick and portable: Pretty much the height and length of a credit card, and the width of two CD Cases. So compact, I easily lose it in my pocket sometimes!*Picture Quality - 3x Optical Zoom with 3.4 Megapixels and a Carl Zeiss lensframe. Don't understand what I'm saying? Neither do I, but damn if these pictures aren't good looking.*Weight - Remember the really old cameras where you had to put them on a tripod, put your hand up holding a huge bulb, and hide your head under a cloth to take a picture? Well yeah, this isn't anything like it :-P*Video - Not really something to point out here, but I just love filming video on my camera with friends (I've made over 100 videos, and I have a 1 GB Stick, allowing to film up to 46 minutes per video!)Cons:*Microphone - Filming takes a little used to, considering the microphone is on top of the camera where I usually put my index finger to rest*Scroll button - Looking through the menus and previews of pictures/videos can be tough, being that the scroll is just a tiny knob that you have to push to the left/right/up/down.In my opinion, a great first buy for me.

Also, what would be good; (though haven't seen in many other cameras) is for the light to work when capturing 'movies' at night time. Otherwise, it's too dark to see who's who. To reliably render faces you'd need as much light as is needed to read a menu. But, at least the audio compensates. Can be assured it's going to pick-up intelligible voices from across a table in a noisy restaurant.Pros:V.Good Battery life. Excellent at capturing moving subjects in dim lighting! In fact, I find the muscle of this camera and the beauty of its photographs most apparent in low-lit conditions. On the movie function- there's no capture time limit. You can film so long as your memory stick permits! Ultimately, it's not a super-thin camera but it is small! It's just that it can stand on it's own without toppling! Trust me, I've seen other people's cameras do this just as the timer was about to snap a photo.Heartbreakingly, I broke this camera's LCD after only 2 weeks of purchase but I'm still a satisfied customer. Anyway, it was my stupidly it broke and nothing to do with Sony.I couldn't have the LCD replaced straightaway because it was far too expensive so I carried on using it as was.It was very easy actually.. I estimated where to hold the camera and it was always on 'Auto'... (unfortunately with most of the option functions being displayed on the LCD menu, I never got any access to those either).I've had the camera for one whole year now and I haven't felt a pressing need to replace it. Beautiful pictures and with little effort!! I do have an idea of what I'm taking a picture of especially at night time because the camera cleverly beams an infra-red light on to the subject. And I just snap blindly and everyone agrees the photos are excellently sharp and better than my friends' equivalently sized counterparts especially when taken in a club and people are dancing etc ie. lots of movement and dim light is concerned.I'm really quite surprised some people claim it blurs. I mean could their 'conditions of use' be any harder than mine?! I have no LCD, no access to additional camera functions and what's more.. tend to take pictures when partying with my friends! And we aren't exactly still or taking pictures with a particularly steady hand at this point. Yet, the image quality and detailing is amazing! If you keep zooming in you can make out a single eyelash. Really flattering photographs!I'm not giving it five stars because it's obviously physically fragile.

Many people mistake the small size as durability. Sony makes good cameras but this one is not for rookie camera folks. I would recommend getting a Kodak or Canon SureShot as a first camera, then graduate yourself to this one. People complain that their pictures aren't good in dark/low lighting. Well, of course! The tiny flash on this thing isn't going to make a big impact on the lighting of your pictures.

The two I currently have (P5 and P100) have performed beautifully over the years. I've never had a lick of problem with either. So, when I decided to buy a small compact camera that I could throw in a pocket I decided to go with Sony again. After looking at the T1 model, I wasn't too impressed with the picture quality. Too much of a compromise was made to get the unit small. Then I can across the L1. It has been the perfect little camera. It's small- about the size of a Snicker's bar- so I can keep it in my pocket. The pictures are terrific- 4Mp meets all my needs. The picture quality has been superb too. Much better than the T1. Although I mostly run it off of full auto mode, it does have nearly as many manual options as my P100 has (ISO, scenes, quality). And to top it off, the camera is fast. Power on to first shot plus shot to shot timing is lightning fast. I've been very happy with this camera.There are a few things that keep me from giving it a full 5 stars. First, while the LCD is sharp and works well in most lighting, it's still on the small size compared to other cameras. There is room on the camera where they could have put in a 1.8\" or even 2\" LCD instead. That would have made a big difference. Also for some reason, Sony chose to go with a separate bracket for tripod attachment instead of putting the screw mount right on the camera. This is a pain. Fortunately, I don't use a tripod with the L1 very often.Overall the L1 is a great little camera. For the cost, it's portability and picture quality can't be beat", "Date": "March 15, 2005"}, {"Title": "camera doesn't charge through USB connection", "Author": "Kyung A.

I got mine for Christmas last year and within the first 2 months the pin on the command dial had broken. I had to pay to ship it into Sony's repair center and wait 2 weeks for them to fix it. Luckily, it was under warranty. I wasn't so lucky the second time. I went to take a picture with the thing and it blanked out. I thought the battery just needed to be charged, but no such luck. It won't turn on, it won't charge, and the lens is stuck in the on position. It's still under warranty, but Sony wants me to ship it back to their repair center, wait another 2 weeks to fix it, and pay $171 for labor on the thing, even though it's only 6 months old and barely been used. I have a carrying case for it and it is in excellent condition. This thing is not worth the hassles- check out another brand of camera that has a more reliable customer care policy!", "Date": "July 26, 2005"}, {"Title": "It's going back", "Author": "JHM \"jensays\"", "ReviewID": "RXTOUTAHEOJMP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "One reviewer mentioned that their L1 broke on the 29th picture.
