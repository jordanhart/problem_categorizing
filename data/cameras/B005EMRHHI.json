{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice affordable underwater camera", "Author": "maddmurf", "ReviewID": "R3V5RRPLBDGPVO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was worried about this camera, found it to perform quite well.  We took it snorkelling in Mexico and only took underwater pictures.  I did buy rechargeable batteries and they did just fine.  The pictures were just as I expected.  Not like a pro, but pretty good.  Did not try the video, cause the view finder is kind of hard to see.  It is a little small, but everything is different underwater.  No leaks and I did change batteries once.  I got about 100 pictures on a battery charge.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not user friendly", "Author": "H. Argyle \"Critical consumer\"", "ReviewID": "R32A2H7UZB7YWZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after losing my good Canon digital to a saltwater splash.  Unfortunately, it is not easy to use, and therefore probably will be used only as a \"disposable\" backup.  Buttons are very rigid, and unresponsive, leading to missed shots.  It is battery hungry, and picture quality is decent, but only in natural daylight.  Worst design feature is that the USB port is inside the battery compartment, and un-usable.  The micro SD card is teeny, and not easy to use either.  Poor design kills this camera.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quality of camera is horrable", "Author": "MHC IT Department", "ReviewID": "R3MNE4S6VLGAVU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Quality of camera is horrable. Did not re-produce color's correctly and was extremly grainy. Completly unusable. Tried taking pictures in all MP options and turning setting off and on like image stabilization produced the same results.I would expect the quality of the picture to come from a 1MP camera, not a 12MP camera.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 5 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Bell & Howell Splash WP7 Waterproof Digital Camera (Blue) +\n<2> Transcend 8GB microSDHC Card +\n<3> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet +\n<4> PD 5pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <5> PD Flexible Table Mini Tripod", "Name": "Bell & Howell Splash WP7 Waterproof Digital Camera (Blue) with 8GB Card/Reader + Cleaning & Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FpytTKktL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005EMRHHI"}}
