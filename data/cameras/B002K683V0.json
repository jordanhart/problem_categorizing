I made arrangements with a neighbor at exactly that distance to share his internet connection with me.  I purchased this item and hooked the two up.  It was easy to connect and I have had no problems with it.Using this device requires only moderate technical ability during the very first connection.  After that, it can be forgotten about completely.  Although the casing around the antenna appears of good quality, it is still made of only plastic and I doubt it's ability to withstand direct exposure to extremely strong storm winds.", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worth Every Penny ... so far!", "Author": "John A. Fiedler", "ReviewID": "R1C820AYW2BA15", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The EZ-Bridge Lite system has solved a twenty year old problem for us and saved a lot of money in the process. We live and work in rural Idaho where DSL is either non-existent or slow and expensive at best. Ours is slow and expensive! Our home is several hundred yards from our office and we pay for DSL service at both buildings. With the EZ-Bridge system we save money! It was very easy to set up. I knew I would have to mounth the units on the outside of each building, but I was concerned about the dense \"wall\" of Ponderosa Pine between them. Today was a rainy day and I did not want to venture outside. I set up the base unit near our server and a windown. The I set up the remote unit on my desk out the house. To my complete surprise, despite wall, windows, trees and distance, the units detected one another without problems. I'll grant the signal was weak, but once everything is properly mounted, it should be great. Time will tell how the system survives hot summers and gold winters, so I will try to update this review as time goes on.", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Rock Solid!", "Author": "CCDFLA \"CI Professional\"", "ReviewID": "R3ICV5L5IBBPCZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Rock solid operation. Easy install. Anyone can do it. Great friendly tech support. I am using it to go from my house to my business. They are about 300yds apart through a dense pine forest. It works great.Follow-up....over a year later and still running strong. 100% uptime so far. I was woriied that last summer the dense foliage growth would block the signal but that was never the case. GREAT PRODUCT!", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good while they work", "Author": "NoSpam", "ReviewID": "R17R7SXHF8CZQG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've been through two sets of these bridges.  On the plus side, they worked over a 3.5 mile link.  One pair lasted over a year through cold & heat extremes of the high desert.On the down side, making changes from the default settings tends to get the units locked into a non-workable state.  Very poor documentation as well.  I eventually just lived with the default settings.  Not very secure.The plastic housing is very thin and flimsy.  They are not waterproof by any means.  The second set only lasted 2 months before failing.  At that point I gave up on them.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "450 ft through forest", "Author": "Clive McCarthy", "ReviewID": "RDSZHWVDGMU58", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had concerns about this bridge working through dense forest. It does. I have a cabin and a barn 450 feet apart with NO LINE OF SIGHT. I could figure the direction required to line up the antennas by using Google maps. The accuracy does not have to be great because the antenna's lobes are not that tight.The result is a -56dBm signal and a 54Mbps data rate. Now our cabin is connected to our Wildblue satellite network available in the barn. I may purchase another of these to 'wire' the entire property.If you are a Mac or Linux user beware. The utility software is only available for Windows. This means that finding the IP addresses of the bridge units, to custom configure them, REQUIRES a Windows computer. However, the default configuration works just fine as a bridge so don't be put off by this. There are other tools that can determine the IP addresses allocated to the bridge if necessary.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "It works well if you know what you are doing...", "Author": "User528", "ReviewID": "R3H4J8PW7Z1ALB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this unit operational for over 2 years... yes it can be temperamental, but once you set it up it runs like a dream! I am able to get 10 Mbps/sec sustained transfer rate running at 30% power at a distance of 300 feet. It's very important to set the power based on distance, I also found line of sight is critical for stable connectivity. Also, you must use STP cable, as the units are sensitive to EMP from storms and the like. I also recommend connecting the units to a UPS for additional protection. I also recommend purchasing a spare card which is easily swappable out of the antenna housing for backup in case one goes down. These units are inexpensive and the extra peace of mind is worth it. I have not found a comparable system as this price point. I recommend a tech savvy installer, setup an open based system first and then employe encryption for added security, I found no difference in transfer rates open or secured.  All in all very pleased with these units and would highly recommend. Make sure to configure everything in one room... confirming all operational ability before you deploy into the field.Good Luck!", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "amazingly easy", "Author": "B Joyful, Aspen, Colo. \"B Joyful\"", "ReviewID": "R12JZRQEUXE1P6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "simple setup, a monkey could do iti went from 900k to 4MB/sec, huge improvementgreat range, no signal conflict (seems to auto-detect/sync channels for conflict avoidance)aiming needed only to be approximatei didnt even mount, this allows me to reposition easilymy research anticipated best of class, product exceeds expectations", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Had for over 3 years running.", "Author": "Ryan Jones", "ReviewID": "R35XZH31T2AQHZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Installed this to cover only about a 1km, but installed and configured and have had running non-stop pretty much straight through the past 3 years.

Not able to get response from tech support", "Author": "Bob9", "ReviewID": "R11SFS7LN0J1WB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wanted to use this as a dedicated point to point internet connection to a detached house about 40-50 feet away from my main house with the units installed indoors (and therefore sending the signal through stucco walls).Units were easy to set up and seemed to work fine as per their manual.  Given the proximity, it did require some adjustment to parameters to get the signal strength within their recommended values.  However, the actual throughput was insufficient to support video streaming (HD video streaming using windows media center).  To be fair to EZ-Bridge, their specified bandwidth may simply not be enough for this purpose.  I could find no documentation that would tell me exactly what WMC requires, but the bandwidth test in WMC indicated it was just under what would be required for HDTV.The frustrating part for me is that I tried to contact EZ Bridge by both telephone and their website to see if there were any other parameters I might tweak to get this to work properly and they did not answer the support line (with no option to leave a message) and my web query was never answered.
