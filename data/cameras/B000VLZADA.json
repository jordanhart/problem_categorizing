The quality of the pictures are clear, bright, and focused. This camera can be used for close up shots that are in focus, and faraway shots that capture the whole scene. The camera has different modes designed for novice photographers to seasoned ones. There is also a video mode with sound capabilities. The camera also comes with a stylus to use when viewing your images, as well as a fun picture frame option.
