{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So Far So Good. Not Perfect, But What Is? 4.5 Stars. Bought Another After 10 Months!", "Author": "Ethan A. Winning \"ewin64\"", "ReviewID": "R2EXHNY6237XHC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sept. 1, 2012 - Although I'm always leery that Canon will come out with a new model soon after I order a camera, I have just placed an order for an SX40HS for my wife! Some of you may think that it must be worth 5 stars now, and the answer is that it is not perfect. Low light even using a higher ISO is still an issue, but the lens and IS at 35x are superb. Many of the photos that I have posted with this review have recently won photo contests, and that is certainly due to the equipment almost as much as my knowing how to use it.****Nov. 3, 2011 and Jan. 13, 2012 - [Please see posted photos here and my web site from my first days' and most recent shootings. A picture is worth a thousand words.] I will do a complete review as the weather clears and I can take some photos in various light conditions. So far, it has performed well enough, but there is a learning curve from the SX20 which allowed greater latitude in overriding what the camera \"wants to do.\"It may take a month before I can review the camera adequately, so I have uploaded some photos that I took on the first day, and I must say that they're pretty good. However, there were only 8 out of 51 taken. ...And then it started to rain. Please note that I am not new to the Canon line or (nature) photography: I have had the A620, S3, S5, SX10, SX20, and now the SX40. (I returned the SX30 which was a terrible disappointment.) And I've been taking pictures for over 60 years. So, unless you really get to know the camera - and even then - you may or may not get the results that I do.On that note, I might add that I was sorely disappointed that Canon didn't pop for a printed manual which, with this camera, is a must. Unlike the SX20 for which I could use the SX10 manual, this camera is quite different and - so far - I think more complex or at least more different than the SX20. Because of the issues that I've run into just in 3 days, it's very difficult to cross-reference what it says under Av with Tv or C1. This is not the basic point-and-shoot Elph, and I rarely shoot in \"Auto.\" As I said, I have to give it a couple of weeks before I'll pass judgment.I must say that the photos that WERE already posted when I bought the camera gave me some trepidation in that so many were a little washed out. What I am finding so far is that, \"Auto\" might well be \"Average.\" Average aperture, Average speed, Average contrast. But I purchased it anyway, and I've already found that Av or Tv or M are still the best settings although, unlike the SX20 where one could just set the speed and the camera would use the setting, I had to save the Tv settings to C1 or C2. This became routine by my third day (today).Nov. 8, 2011:Five days since I got the camera, and three days of shooting. I must say I've never seen so many comments regarding reviews, and many people have agreed with the more negative comments. What I've found is that the quality of photos I've taken have been excellent, needing very little post-production diddling. That said, and having used the burst mode, I'm deleting 4/5ths of the pix that I've taken, some because of duplication, some because of focus, and some because I just screwed up.In looking at the negative comments, I would admonish people to decide before buying this camera - or any other camera - WHAT DO YOU WANT TO USE THE CAMERA FOR??? I take pictures of nature, some scenery, but mostly birds, bugs, bunnies, bees, bears, and begonias. The SX40 HS has done very well in these areas, and I realize that there is a learning curve for such extreme focal lengths and the macro (which I rarely use).If you're going to take night time shots - which seems to have garnered so much comment about viewfinders and such - I can't address it. I took a picture of the (harvest) moon, hand-held, in Tv mode and it came out beautifully. But I don't take many nighttime pix, and I haven't had a chance to take fireworks in years. (If I want snapshots of people or parties, I use my wife's Elph.)I am still having some difficulty in overriding what the camera is set for re: aperture and speed. The SX20 could be overridden just by setting the speed to 1/2500th and one would get a much darker picture which could then be adjusted with software. Sometimes, it's the only way to get realistic clouds. With the SX40, I set it for 1/2500 and when I shoot, the camera comes down to 1/1600 or slower. IF I ever get the printed manual that Canon promised, I'll look for the menu where I can increase the value of the photo by -3 to +3. Yeah, I'm being a little lazy, but I hate the .pdf manual on disc that came with the camera.On the plus side, by coming down to 12 mp from 14 and by improving the processor, I can finally get SOME pix in low light or at least on a cloudy day. I've posted a few photos from the past few days: the two of the golden-crowned sparrows and the hummer were taken in low light and in thickets. They came out as sharp as anything I've ever taken with the SX10 or 20 (or S3 or S5 etc. etc.). Another plus, I am not having as much trouble with the SX40 focusing on a bird in the middle of a tree. The camera spots the center and at least HALF the time immediately seems to understand I want the bird not the branches.IF every photo I took came out perfectly, where's the fun in photography? Yes, sometimes the SX40 frustrates me, but Mother Nature sometimes frustrates me. Sometimes I think Mother Nature is picking on me. I ALWAYS though that Canon picked on everybody. After all, why do they come out with an improvement (?) every 10-12 months? Okay, the SX30 was terrible...I'll continue this in another week or so. For the time being, what I really like is the sharp photos I've been getting, and the 8 fps in the burst mode (the third is usually the best). I'm still not crazy about is the lack of an override for Tv and Av even using the C1, and I THINK the viewfinder is smaller than the SX20.Oh, btw, this camera is a few crucial (after a 5 hour hike) ounces less than the SX20. It's probably because it has a proprietary battery instead of the 4 AAs. I like the weight. What I don't like is that Canon wants $59 for a second battery, and has warned me about buying from \"the secondary market.\" Comments? Suggestions? I'd appreciate knowing if there's a reliable battery that will work with this camera. (One of the other dealers offering a second battery as part of the SX40 HS package has been called out for offering a battery that doesn't fit the SX40!)I think it's silly to say that the LCD isn't as clear as a computer monitor. Never had one that was, and I'm often disappointed when something that looks in focus on the LCD is not nearly as sharp on my computer. After 12 years of digital photography, I've become accustomed to it. At least I didn't waste any film and have to wait two weeks to find out that my vacation pix are lousy.Still 4 stars for the features, 5 for the photos I've taken, and 3.5 for Canon engineers.Nov. 14, 2011.I posted more photos which speak for themselves. However, there is a caveat: I took 191 photos this morning mostly of deer, wild turkey, hawks, one praying mantis, and one tarantula. Of the 191, I posted (on my own site) 9. Here, I posted 5. And I kept 11. 180 were deleted, and that brings up two points. The burst mode of 8 fps works. That is, the SX40 really can shoot at 8 frames per second. However, not all will be in focus; many will be identical shots; and it is not the panacea for carefully composing and focusing and being at the right setting. (If you need the burst mode, you may be best off in Tv because speed is what you're after.)And please note: The battery is rated at being able to take 400 photos at the highest resolution and using the viewfinder (380 using the LCD). Well, if you shoot in the burst mode often or you take \"movies,\" expect your battery to go in about 250 shots - and that's fast at 8 fps. I have just purchased two more batteries and, though they're not Canon \"approved\" because they're 1/4th the price, I'm hoping that I now will never run out of batteries while shooting. Will report on that when I get them.Just one note re: the battery indicator. When the battery indicator is down from 3 (full) to 2 bars, it only takes 3-5 more photos to get it to show red and Charge the Battery. This isn't a lot more helpful than the old SX20 which allowed about 10 shots when it said to change the battery without any precursor. I was really looking forward to having a real battery indicator. This ain't it. Still 4.5 stars.Nov. 22, 2011I started this review on Nov. 3 by saying, \"So far so good,\" but I had a few reservations. I no longer have reservations, and would definitely recommend the SX40 to anyone who is more than a novice photographer. This is not a \"simple\" point and shoot, and you may get more than what you need or even want.It takes great photos, but you still have to know how to tweak its capabilities. If you're just going to keep this at \"Auto,\" then you don't need this camera. However, if you really want such features as taking movies and using \"my colors\" and a quasi-fisheye mode, this may very well be the camera for you. If you want to take pictures in RAW, this is not the camera for you (it doesn't have RAW). I care about none of these things, so for me the camera gets 4.5 stars. If you want those features, this camera may be only a 3 or 4.So basically, I'm content with my purchase. There's no second-guessing. No alternative would have made me happier. I REALLY like it, but I don't love it. BUT look at it this way: if I got perfect pictures every time, it would take all the fun out of digital photography. I still need room for creativity ... and improvement.April 1, 2012: Note - if you are planning on taking videos using this camera, you may find the 8GB card to be insufficient. Though this is a good price, I suggest buying a 16GB card for videos or if you're going to take photos at the highest resolution which I highly recommend.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "This one has it all!!!!", "Author": "Eugene", "ReviewID": "R2CUSN3SR3AQ7L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a Nikon D7000, which I think is a very good camera.  I was looking for a lighter camera that can take good photos with good quality.  The one camera I can travel with, take photos of my three year old's birthday as well as the sunset.The detail on this camera amazed me.  The quality that is obtained without any extras, without any training in photography makes it the camera that I was looking for.  I have selected to use the class 10 memory card, which I believe was a good choice, adding to the quality.I have also purchased the Zeikos Digital Pro Slave Flash ZE-DS12 and although I was unsure if this was the correct choice, I am 100% satisfied with the flash and the way it work with the camera.  Being a perfectionist that does not have the time to go for proper training and like things to happen the easy way, this camera turned out to be the perfect choice!!  The most outstanding factor for me is the detail that I am able to capture and the quality of the photos, without any effort.", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Best Choice Short of a DSLR", "Author": "El Barto", "ReviewID": "R3F595P2MM10E7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned Nikon film SLR's and Digital Cameras before I moved to the Canon SX10 IS.  Now, I have purchased this Canon SX40 HS and am very pleased with it.  While this camera is not perfect, there is room for some improvement, it is the best overall choice for me.  I require a camera with a big zoom, good image stabilization, manual controls, and doesn't require a suitcase to carry it around, the SX40 HS does this for me.  There are two improvements that I would like to see.  One is a separate manual adjustment dial that doesn't also function as a switch.  The other improvement I would like to see is RAW support.  While I can get this using CHDK, it would be nicer to have it built in.As far as the kit goes,  the case is adequate for job it was intended.  The card reader is handy, the 8 GB memory card is not one of the faster ones generally available now. And don't forget the little bottle of isopropyl alcohol and five cotton swabs they call a cleaning kit.

I took photos outside of our dogs and they are active and most of those pictures came out rather well and I was surprised about that since they were moving around a lot. Their photos of them sitting or laying really came out extremely good!This camera will be a good one for me to use for vacation photos of scenery and family photos and probably not for fast-paced stuff like car races or sporting events.What I like about this camera is several things.....including a large 35X Optical zoom lens, looks well-built, has a flip out LCD viewfinder, has an optical viewfinder also, fairly easy to use and battery life is pretty decent for rechargeable batteries.What I don't care much about this camera are just 2 things.....when I have the camera on AUTO mode, the zoom sometimes refuses to zoom out and I have to turn it off and back on to get the zoom working [I may have to look at the manual mode for using this camera to bypass that problem] and this camera uses a rechargeable battery. Get several of these rechargeable batteries if you plan to use it a lot.I have not tried video mode with this camera, yet. So, no comment on the video quality on this camera.Indoor photos with and without flash seems to be pretty decent in quality. Outdoor photos are overall quite good and good color qualities also.Overall, I think this Canon SX40 HS digital camera is a decent camera for general photography such as vacations, scenery and family photos. I am not sure if this camera will be good for high speed uses such as sporting events or races.So, I would give it 4 out of 5 stars overall and recommend this camera.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best affordable camera ever", "Author": "Bev65", "ReviewID": "R3S40204DWSKBS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Canon Power shot SX40 a few weeks ago.

I bought the camera a few months ago as an upgrade from a 15+ year old camera which worked well but did not have an anti-shake feature.  My old camera was taking blurry photos because I now shake when using a camera, and even a small shake can blur the picture.For me, this was an expensive camera.  On top of the anti-shake feature, I also liked the built in power of the telephoto lens.  All these features work well.My biggest complaint is the screen.  Because of my eyes I use glasses when viewing the screen and have to take them off to look through the viewfinder.  Inside the screen is great, but outside the screen becomes hard to see in bright light.  Very hard.  It is also difficult to see any detail in the screen when trying to line up the shot.  What I have to do is take a wider shot than normal and then use my computer to crop it down to the size and view I like.  Not being able to distinguish detail while I am framing the shot is disturbing to me.  The view through the viewfinder is also very small.I now realize that when using a full sized 35mm style camera of old I would put the viewfinder up to my eye then press my elbows into my ribcage to steady the shot.  This made the camera steady for most shots.  Because of the small nature of this camera and the rather crummy view through the viewfinder I can't do this easily.  I now have to hold the camera away from my face and use the screen which makes framing the shot harder because the screen is further away from my far less than 20-20 eyes.The camera is small for my hands and that makes it hard to hold and push the little buttons.  The screen folds in, but to open it up for picture taking isn't easy for me because the small detent designed to allow opening the screen doesn't fit my finger.  I don't want to leave the screen exposed during transport so I always fold it in to avoid scratching.The Powershot has so many \"features\" that I cannot keep track of them.  The manual is on a disk.  It completely covers operating the camera.  Maneuvering through all the menus is hard, and a lot of the choices are beyond me.  I normally just put the thing on auto and fire away, which means I paid for a lot of flexibility that I will not be using.The pictures are excellent and the anti-shake works well.  None of my photos have come out blurred.  The flash works well.  The lens adjusts and focuses quickly.The bottom line is I bought the wrong camera.  I needed to buy a larger style of camera, like the old 35mm, with a great viewfinder so I could use my ancient shot framing method.  My only real complaints about the camera are its size, too small, and the poor viewfinder.AD2", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot SX40 HS", "Author": "Charmk9 \"Charmk9\"", "ReviewID": "R1RAR7USLIIDK7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera looked nice.
