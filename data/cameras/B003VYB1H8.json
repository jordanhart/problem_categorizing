It was fun to use, but took bad pictures.The design and interface is great.  The menus are easy to navigate and making changes to the settings is quick and very simple.  It does take the shots quickly just like I wanted (no anticipating, just shoot exactly when you want it to take).  I love the touch screen.  It is by far the most fun and enjoyable camera I've ever used, however the output isn't great.We have a hard time getting good pictures.  Landscape pictures in bright daylight are about the only ones that look really good.  Indoor ones are always grainy, and live action shots are always blurry unless in full daylight.  Do any zooming indoors and forget it.  So it seems that the flash just isn't strong enough, and the internal zoom lens isn't the best design.  Bummer!  We've played with the settings some and certain situations have been able to improve the images, but I like having a camera that can be in auto and shoot great pictures no matter what the situation is (especially when on the go like on vacation).  This camera has a smart scene selection mode where it chooses the appropriate scene setting based on its brains, but I think it often chooses wrong.  I gave up on that setting and went to regular Auto mode.", "Date": "December 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fujifilme z800EXR Camera", "Author": "Don Dinsmore", "ReviewID": "R3Q4DWIAA0RDKR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera had severe lcd touch screen problems that did not resolve themselves during the first week. The repair process to resolve the problems was just short of four weeks and the \"repaired\" camera had a different set of touch screen problems when tried out for a week. Had to drag information from the repair department concerning status of camera. Cannot believe my experience with FujiFilm product and repair department were unique to me? I am requesting a refund instead of a second repair that would have expensive out of warrentee costs! Would suggest not buying the Z800EXR until they get the bugs out of it!", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "FinePix Z800EXR", "Author": "Robert White", "ReviewID": "RIG6XPHS2YNCS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good quality - appears to be a good value/cost camera.  When using, it feels quite small -smaller than you would expect by looking at the reviews.  It is easy to learn and has a lot of useful features.  I strongly recommend a case, since the touch screen is almost the entire back of the camera.  The only negative I've discovered so far is the 'battery level' - the indicated 'last half- goes very quickly.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Only an average consumer point and shoot, Facebook does not work", "Author": "anotherbuyer", "ReviewID": "R2W25JAI16TBI6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this as a gift based primarily on its Facebook tag & upload feature. That feature would not work  - there is a problem with either the PC software or the Facebook site itself, but Fuji support was of no help. The pictures it takes are average - not as good as our CoolPix and about as good as our cheapo Olympus. The camera does a good job of taking pictures in low light, only using flash when absolutely necessary. Touch screen works very well especially the \"swipe\" picture browse. Most common functions are easy to find on the large, bright touch screen. Given the average pictures and broken Facebook software, I returned the camera.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good idea, bad execution.", "Author": "Mafalda Quinn", "ReviewID": "R3FGGSVLWYVXW8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was so looking forward to getting this camera. I was attracted by the big screen and the ability to take vertical and horizontal panoramas. (tall buildings, wide spaces). Fuji tried to put so many bells and whistles that ended up with a confusing program. The panorama doesn't allow you to create a less than 120 degree shot, when you need no more than 2 shots to create a good one. More than that and it gets too thin and long.  After reading the reviews, I ended up with a GE W1486, absolutely great and simple and you can create your panorama the way you like it. Sometimes simplicity wins the day. I put it on Auto, canceled the flash, and I am able to take superb pictures inside and out. Great names many times take a back seat to an unknown or newcomer.", "Date": "May 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great purchase", "Author": "Nancy Pants", "ReviewID": "R2P6A0X0KS7CPL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read the reviews by people that had bought this camera and they weren't very great reviews but after purchasing it and playing with it i had no bad reviews and its a great camera...

Reid", "ReviewID": "RSCCSYB5HQ73X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received a defective camera, but mistakenly threw away the packaging so I had to send it to Fuji for repairs. When I called after they received it (FedEx tracking), they explained to me that it would take two weeks for a technician to look at it. A week after the two weeks, still no word. A follow up call received a promise of a new camera. A week later, my original camera arrived with no explanation at all, just the camera in an otherwise empty box. The fuzzy pictures problem had been solved, but movies taken indoors were uniformly dark regardless of settings. Snapshots under an overcast sky also come out dark.I think there is a serious sensor problem with the camera, and perhaps some quality control issues. The menu system is okay, but not intuitive or well organized. While I will contact them again for repairs, I am not optimistic. I don't think I will buy another Fuji camera, and definitely not the high end one I was planning on buying.
