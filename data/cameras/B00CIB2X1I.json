The shutter release and eye cup were delivered two days after I placed my order. The camera, however, came regular free shipping and arrived several days later. I paid more for shipping on the two small items than they were worth. To top it off the camera didn't not function properly and I will have to return it and hope that a replacement shows up -- I would have thought that I could have just returned the camera box but apparently have will have to repackage everything to return the malfunctioning box. This was my fourth Cannon Eos Rebel and I love the camera -- the shipping errors and exchange policy, however, have me scratching my head.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CIB2X1I"}}
