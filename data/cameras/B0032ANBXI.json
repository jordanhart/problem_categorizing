{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Low-Light performance!", "Author": "Black Lemon", "ReviewID": "R16GGAU42HF8HV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Casio Exilim EX-FH100's four main draws over other cameras are it's low-light capability, its high speed burst photography, it's slow motion video, and it's loooong battery life.The excellent low-light performance comes (mostly) from the back-illuminated CMOS sensor which allows for more light gathering than traditional sensors. The camera takes a better shot in low-light situations than similarly sized cameras (small sensor cameras) without the backlit sensor (Sony however has a similar sensor called EXMOR on some of its newest models).The high speed features include both a high speed shutter that allows amazing action shots (30 shots at a rate of 40fps in burst mode), and high speed video filming for gorgeous slow-motion video (can slow 1 second down to 14 seconds at the max setting of 1,000fps).The camera further leverages the above features for some neat tricks in difficult lighting situations, which are unusual abilities for this compact form-factor. The sensor and high speed shutter are used together for several preset modes that help in low light. \"Lighting Mode\" is suggested for situations where parts of the frame are bright and other parts are dim -- it takes several high speed shots at various settings, then combines them for a more evenly lit image. There's a similar mode for night shots. The combination helps keep noise unnoticeable even at high ISOs.The stereo mic is a nice plus over most other cameras (though also present on the only current competitor to this product, Sony's Cyber Shot DSC-HX5V). Other notable features are the wide angle lens, and the availability of a mode that combines mechanical image stabilization with the continuous shutter mode to reduce blur. There are also modes that use the continuous shutter to record both before and after the shutter is fully depressed, to allow you to choose a different moment if for example the person you are photographing closes their eyes or changes their expression.Spec for spec, The Casio Exilim EX-FH100 and Sony's Cyber Shot DSC-HX5V are nearly identical. However, the Casio has a few advantages - a larger aperture, longer battery life (520 shots vs. 310 shots), a faster continuous shutter mode (40fps vs. 10 fps), slow motion video, the option of RAW format (useful if you like to manipulate images with professional photo tools), and priority modes (aperture, shutter - which are common but Sony omits them on the HX5V). On the other hand, the Sony allows use of the optical zoom while filming video (in movie mode the Casio only does digital zoom), has a panorama stitching mode, and has GPS capabilities with position & direction metadata.While the basic functions are easy to use - even switching from HD video to slow motion is just a toggle switch -- I suggest reading the full manual on the accompanying CD. Certain things are not obvious, such as how to find the two particular video modes that allows switching on-the-fly from HD video to VGA slow-motion video (you don't use the Regular vs. HS video toggle switch for this because doing so stops the recording. For a seamless transition, you actually set the toggle switch to HS mode, and then choose a setting in the menu for on-the-fly transitions, which are then operated via the left & right keys).Thankfully, Casio has eliminated the pointless video length limit they had put on the previous model, the FH10.Note that while 30fps video can be up to 720p HD, and slow-motion video at 120fps is VGA quality, increasing the slow-motion beyond this (max is 1,000fps) results in decreasing the screen area displayed as a trade-off to maintain video quality at that data transfer rate. Worth mentioning here is that video can be output via the mini-HDMI out port. A composite A/V cable is included, but if you want mini-HDMI to regular HDMI, you'll have to buy your own cable.For still shots in continuous shutter mode, it will take 30 shots (or fewer if you release the shutter button) at a rate that is selectable from a scale of 1fps over the duration of 30s, up to 40fps within 1s (yes, you are limited to 30 shots, but the rate goes up to 40fps).I suggest you set the image quality to Fine and up the sharpness to +2 if you're going to be cropping or printing to large sizes. You'll also want to use a SDHC card that is rated \"Class 6\" or higher to ensure the memory can achieve the necessary sustained write rate to record HD video or high speed shots.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "There's a reason for the mediocre average rating on this one...", "Author": "O. Greene", "ReviewID": "R34JB6ZL9TRZ7H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this as a compact camera, with an emphasis on HD video, for an upcoming road trip. I had an older Panasonic TZ3 and wanted a similarly sized camera with better video (HD) and preferably more manual control.I spent a while researching the purchase both in Amazon reviews and elsewhere. While the Amazon reviews were luke warm, the feature set seemed good, and I'd always wanted to try a Casio camera. I also paid particular attention to a DPReview comparison of \"Compact Travel Zoom\" cameras since it included this Casio as well as the descendant of the TZ3 the Panasonic ZS7, and many others. It seemed like a perfect reference since in theory it was comparing all the cameras in this category side-by-side: [...]In that review this Casio earns a high recommendation, with relatively minor reservations, and is one of 2 top picks. Unfortunately I have to disagree with DPReview this time, since I have now tested both the Casio (their top pick) and the Panasonic ZS7 (not among their top picks), and I much prefer the Panasonic for reasons I'll explain.First and most important is photo quality. To put it succinctly, it is really pretty mediocre. The DPReview tests showed it to be inferior at night shots, which I was ready for and didn't mind so much since I have a decent dSLR. Unfortunately I found that even the photos in daylight are not as good as I expected, or as good as the DPReview samples led me to believe. I was using the default settings (as I believe was DPR), with a mix of auto and manual controls. Yet I struggled to get anything better than mediocre (at best) shots.I found I got the best results on manual since the auto settings would often choose slower shutter speeds than were needed to freeze movement (presumably in an effort to keep ISO and noise down). What disappointed me more was, even when I got a sharp shot, there was noticeable noise reduction, even for fairly bright pictures. The remarkable clarity shown in the DPR shots vs. other cameras (for daytime scenes at least) wasn't really evident, even testing against my several generations old Panasonic TZ3. And I don't believe there is any control over noise reduction either. With RAW support being basically unusable with 15 second wait times, and anyway limited to 200ISO (useless), you really have less control than may be needed to get great results.Something else that contributed to worse than desired photo quality was the poor image stabilization. I realize this camera's zoom has a fairly long reach, especially for such a light and small camera, but I also have the ZS7 to compare it against, and I can tell you this Casio does not have a good IS system next to the ZS7. DPR's test show this as well, but again I didn't really expect it to be quite as bad. Unfortunately this affects video too, making low-light video especially jumpy (unnecessarily so, as my ZS7 videos later showed me).Additionally, while DPReview does mention the slow startup time, it was definitely more annoying than I expected. It's funny how the little things can compound issues like this, and in the case of the Casio the fact that it does not respond to the zoom lever once startup is finished unless you depress it *after* startup is complete was what made it extra annoying. Imagine this: you see a distant subject you want to capture, you press the power button and while you're waiting you turn the zoom dial so that as soon as the camera is ready, it will start zooming. Makes sense, right? But it doesn't work that way. Other cameras, including the ZS7, do.I found no really quick and easy way to tell when exactly it had finished startup, since even the display being on and splash screen gone doesn't indicate it's totally done yet. It probably sounds like I'm exaggerating the point, but I truly found that the lack of \"buffering\" of inputs created uncertainty that would delay actual use of the camera sometimes even beyond the 3 second startup time. And when you're trying to grab a shot of a bird or other moving subject, 3 seconds is a long, long time. So if you imagine yourself ever wanting to catch anything in motion, consider the slow startup time heavily in your decision. I know I personally did not give it enough weight when I decided on this purchase.As for video quality, in daylight it's pretty decent, no doubt. It's high definition (720p) and fairly clear. You can get relatively long recordings out of it with a large memory card. But the poor image stabilization is an issue, as I said. I also didn't think I would miss the lack of zooming that much, but I ultimately found it really was frustrating not to have it. The ZS7 does zooming while filming just fine. One nice thing about the Casio with video is it lets you zoom in on video in playback, a feature I liked a lot for HD videos on such a small screen, but it's a minor benefit. You also appear to have some manual control (shutter speed, aperture?) over videos, which I will admit seems better than the ZS7 which can sometimes overexpose bright portions of scenes with tricky lighting (think concerts, with a main performer lit with a bright spot against a dark stage - the main performer will be almost white, losing a lot of detail).The high-speed videos were a brief novelty, but as others (and DPR) have said, the low resolution and high light levels needed to capture anything definitely keep it as a novelty and ultimately seldom used. Worse than that I found the video switch would often get moved from HD to HS (high speed), so I would end up taking a low resolution, high speed shot (without audio!) of a scene I wanted to take an HD video of (with sound!). This obviously only happens when you're in a hurry and not paying attention, but the point of a point and shoot pocket camera is it's supposed to not require as much thought and planning, and ultimately I didn't find that to be the case with this Casio.I suppose in summary perhaps the DPReview did tell me most of what I needed it know: it's slow to start up, has noise reduction issues in image quality, doesn't zoom while filming video, etc. I just didn't think it would be that bad in practice, especially since they ultimately gave it high marks and a top pick. If you actually read their review and experiences, ignoring the numeric ratings and top pick, you probably wouldn't pick this camera up though, it's just that the scores throw you off. So I know I'll be sure to consider the review text a lot more heavily than scores in the future (though I certainly read the reviews in-full many times before buying in this case, and still got caught out). Also pay attention to the Amazon reviews (I usually do), and don't assume that lack of experience or different requirements can entirely explain someone's dissatisfaction. I made this mistake once and won't do it again.So as I indicated several times in this review, I ultimately went with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Black), and am much happier with that.

The main purpose, for me, was to photograph and video my newborn daughter.With those expectations set, I was extremely pleased with the camera! It certainly won't compare to a DSLR in terms of photo quality, or a dedicated video camera in terms of movie quality- but for the size and price,it's great.When I started shopping, I had a few important criteria. Note that these criteria immediately rule out any sort of DSLR (mainly due to size and price)Must Have features:- Portability: I needed a pocket-ish-sized camera, one that I could take everywhere.- Affordability: I was on a relatively strict budget of under $400.- HD Video: I wanted to be able to record at least 720p.Desireable features:- High-speed photo: This is an incredible feature for photographing action (and babies, children, animals, etc).- High-speed video: I have always loved high-speed (slow-motion) video.- * Shockproof / waterproof: I plan to do a lot of outdoor photography, so this would be nice.Ultimately, the Casio ticked off all the boxes save for that last one- it is not waterproof, nor (I imagine) very shockproof. My wife also owned an older Casio Exilim model, and we've been very happy with it, in terms of size versus image quality. So I made my decision, and went with the fh-100.So far, I've been quite pleased with the camera. It takes fairly nice-looking photos and HD video, and the high-speed features are tremendously fun.If you are interested, you can check out my YouTube channel for examples of HD and high-speed video, and my picasa albums for examples of photo quality:[...]My main complaints, after a few months' usage, largely boil down to missing \"wishlist\" features, and other \"hey, it's a point-and-shoot\" type of issues:- Limited aperture range:. It's a beefy camera, but it's still a point-and-shoot.- No intervalometer: This has forced me to use other cameras for time lapse photography.- No zoom or autofocus (or manual focus, for that matter) while recording video.- No A/C power: Not uncommon with cameras, but worth mentioning.- 4GB video limit: It does not continue to shoot video once the 4GB file size limit is reached, without manual intervention.Those last two complaints make it difficult to take long video, even with a large memory card.Clearly these are all minor issues. I would love to see an intervalometer added via some sort of software update, but otherwise I am quite happy with the camera.The battery life is great, but it's still worth buying an extra battery in my opinion, so you're never waiting for it to charge.

The reason I switched over was the slow-motion recording feature. However, not only is this feature incredible on this camera, but the picture quality is unbelievable! I've been taking the most amazing pictures, on par with DSLR's!As for the slow-motion feature, it's extremely easy to use, especially to activate. The HD and Slow-Motion toggle is a great little piece of hardware, and the dedicated video button makes it that much more amazing. As for video quality, WOW! Not only is HD Recording amazingly clear, but switching to 120, 240, or even 420 FPS looks absolutely amazing.. hilarious too! 1000 fps is way too slow for what i'm using it for, and besides the video quality at this speed is too low.As for picture quality, 10x zoom is great, I haven't gotten a single blury shot, and low-light performance is very good. I've been looking for a camera that takes good night pictures, especially at parties. The camera makes skin look natural, not greasy and shiny like other cameras. Colors looks spectacular.As for the screen, i wish it had better quality. I see myself taking pictures and not being impressed with how they look on the camera. But once I download them to my mac, they look STUNNING!Overall very impressed with the camera. I couldn't be happier!", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera overall!", "Author": "J. B. Chung", "ReviewID": "RS6P2ITMQ1EXF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've played with this camera for a week and I love it. It looks nice, fits in your pocket, and it's amazingly fun to play with the slow motion video.The pictures are great. I'm not a big photography expert, so I can't say too much about the picture quality. Compared to other point-and-shoot cameras I've owned like the Canon PowerShot SD870, it's just as good if you're taking normal pictures. However for low light and high speed, this camera kicks ass.But mainly I played with video, it was the main reason I bought this camera. So far it met my expectations. It's really fun and it's just like what you see on YouTube. It's great for analyzing your golf swing or martial arts. It also works in room lighting, but it can be a bit dark at 420-1000fps. When you're outdoors, it works perfect. The resolution at 1000fps is quite small though but it works very well.One minor downside is that the built-in memory is very slow, so when you first get the camera, your experience will be inferior. It will not have much capacity, your HD video recording/playback will be slow and jumpy (as another reviewer pointed out), and 1000fps videos will take a long time to record, and some videos may skip frames. But since I put in a Class 6 8GB SD card, all those problems went away.I've had no issues transferring the videos/pictures to my computer via SD or usb plug.Overall I think it's great value and I would recommend it.", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent for Golf Swings", "Author": "Boston_Qualifier", "ReviewID": "R18W63W5TWXFUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been looking for a reasonably priced camera/camcorder for viewing golf swings for a long time, and this camera has finally done the trick.  I have given it 5 stars on that basis.  (Note: golf clubs travel up to about 135 miles per hour, so this review would be applicable to recording anything up to that speed.)Viewing a golf swing without a blurry image requires a very fast shutter speed -- this camera will do up to 1/40,000 of a second (although 1/8,000 may be fast enough).  Importantly, the shutter speed can be set manually (shutter priority mode) to the fastest speeds with this camera, whereas some other cameras/camcorders that advertise fast shutter speeds do not allow them to be manually set to the fastest speeds, which makes them unacceptable for this purpose.  Granted, you need a lot of light to use the extremely fast shutter speeds, but that should not be an issue for golf swings unless you are trying to record indoors (I was able to get a good image at 1/8,000 outside without being in direct sunlight).You also want a fast frame rate to be sure that you get a lot of images for one swing -- this camera will do up to 1000 frames per second (fps).  The image quality natually goes down as the frame rate goes up, and the quality is not great at 1000 fps, but I have found 120 fps to be quite adequate with a reasonable image quality for viewing a golf swing.Again, this rating is based on the uses described above; I do not have an opinion on the quality of the basic images quality (e.g., individual still pictures) relative to other similarly price cameras.", "Date": "April 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "A really decent camera!", "Author": "Byron Lemmond", "ReviewID": "R3OT4Z7MZFEM3M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera replaced a several year old Canon point and shoot, last in a line of point and shoot Canons, and it compares vary favorably with them all. I'm still fooling with it, but I have had the most satisfying results in natural light using the red square and \"A\" exposure settings. The \"BS\" setting doesn't give me the pictures I want. I added a slave flash that's much bigger than the camera and I'm set for portraits and small groups of people. It's a bit slow cycling between exposures, and the built in flash isn't terribly powerful. My pictures are generally very sharp with minimal artifacts. I haven't used the movie mode yet and may never. The camera is a bit too small, so it's hard to touch the \"on\" button without looking at it, and it could use a bigger grip surface. The camera seems much more solid than my old Canons. The focus speed is not outstanding. On power up/down, the noise the lens makes extending/retracting into the body is disturbing, but it seems to just be a feature of this camera. Battery and memory card access is top notch. The Casio has been able to capture images that compare favorably with ones I've taken with my Canon Rebel DSLR, but of course the little Casio is usable over a narrower range of exposure situations. This is really a usable camera, especially considering the price. Sharp photos! Just OK image stabilization. I think I like it, but I'll be sure in several years.

This camera takes clear photos every time. The burst feature is perfect for babies that always seem to put their hands in front of their faces right when you snap a shot.

Took this camera along, and it worked great, right out of the box. So far, so good, with barely a tweak to the default settings, which I will certainly adjust. I don't understand the complaints about slow startup speed, nor noisy zoom; both are fast and quiet on my camera. What others don't mention is that you can program the left and right buttons on the 4 way controller to quickly adjust your choice of camera settings; I have mine set to ISO, so I can instantly adjust this without going through the on screen menu. There are a number of other helpful choices. I also like that you can set many other defaults yourself in memory; for example, I almost never want the flash to go off. I can set this and forget it, so it will never go off unless I want it to. Hooray!Yes, it's a bit heavier, and a bit larger than other compacts, but that's because it seems built to last and has useful features. It's not as large, nor does it have as many angles or edges to catch on things, than some of its competitors. It fits well in the hand, seems easy to use one handed if needed, has a nice bright screen, and quick action - quick to acquire focus and shoot, even in low light. I like and need that. The power button is easy to find, but small and very slightly recessed, which should help avoid inadvertent battery drain. Very helpfully, you can also program independently the time the screen remains illuminated, and the 'auto off' time for the camera itself.I can see why the dPreview reviewers seemed to choose this camera more frequently for their own use over the other cameras they had for testing. I'll be working it over frequently in the week to come; but for now, and as a very experienced photographer, I think I will enjoy this camera, and will find it very helpful as an all around, every day, always with me camera. And if the battery life is all that everyone else suggests, then so much all the better! That's been the bane so far of many other cameras, whether due to internal circuits or the tiny batteries they must fit.So far, so good, in the first hour of use.LeeUPDATE:  After using this camera for several months now, I still find it quite usable and successful. Brilliant color and clarity in daylight, very workable images in lower light, great buttons and features and programmability.

Stark", "ReviewID": "RJENZFFK5KZQR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I chose this camera primarily for a combination of slow-motion video, HD video, and acceptable photo quality. It's a good choice if that combination of features meets your requirements, but if you're mostly interested in taking really great photos, look at other cameras. In my experience, Canon point-and-shoot cameras produce better photos and they're generally less expensive.About the Casio photo quality... I've posted three nature close-ups to show that this camera is capable of reasonably nice macro shots. The trick in shooting tight close-ups with this camera is to move back from the subject and zoom all the way in on it (camera set to \"macro\" focus). You can get a larger subject that way, essentially seeming to be closer to your subject. This technique tends to create a nice \"bokeh\" or background blur, while the subject is well-focused. The camera usually takes an attractive photo, although it also produces a large share of duds. It does a fair job of autofocusing, although sometimes it hunts or focuses on the background even when the center spot is clearly aimed at the foreground subject. To be sure that you have a good shot, take lots and lots of pictures -- this is the digital age, you don't have to pay for film and processing just to see whether a picture is any good, so why not fill up your camera card? Delete the duds and extras later.Unless you have a full minute or two between shots, you need to set it to take JPEGs, and even then it isn't very fast at saving the highest quality shots. And when it comes to saving RAW photos, this is one of the slowest cameras I've ever worked with. Much as I prefer RAW, on on the Casio EX-FH100 it's way too slow for nature photography, where a few seconds delay is enough for your subject to walk, fly, or swim away. The camera's JPEG photos, when greatly enlarged, show an odd splotchy characteristic that reminds me of the paint effects filters you find in image software such as Photoshop. This means that cropping and enlarging is iffy. Might look good, might not. I'm Photoshop fanatic, and I have over a decade of experience at photo editing, so I don't have a lot of trouble fixing some of the quirkier JPEG artifacts produced by this or other cameras. Most people aren't inclined to play with photo editors, however. Fortunately, this camera's pictures start out fairly big, and most people don't require giant poster-sized copies of all their photos. For snapshots and pictures up to 11-inches, it's not too bad, and every now and then it produces a great photo worthy of poster size.With its good-to-great but sometimes bad-to-terrible photo performance, I might have chosen a different camera, but the video swayed me, and I'm happy I bought the Casio. The HD quality is very nice. It looks as good or better than many dedicated HD camcorders, and it's easy to use. On a tripod, especially, the results are attractive. As many have mentioned, don't look for crisp HD quality in slow-motion videos from this camera. With the slow-motion features, you're getting VHS quality at best, and the quality and image size greatly diminish as you select slower and slower video speed. For my purposes, I usually select the 30-120 option, which provide VHS video quality that you can easily switch between normal speed of 30fps to 1-fourth speed of 120fps. The camera was great for slowing down butterflies and other flying insects, and it did a good job of muffling the effects of a windy day when trying to videotape wildflowers on the prairie, making the rolling fields look mesmerizingly musical. I had a lot of fun setting up this camera on a pond's edge and capturing leaping frogs and playful dragonflies. The slow motion helped when panning the camera by hand, reducing my spazzy shakes and jitters. I don't do sports video, but that would be an interesting use as well, especially for coaches helping athletes review their performance.Be warned however, if recording an event, or shooting vacation footage, or working on any other project using HD and a variety of slow-motion video: because of video size and quality differences in each of this camera's settings, it takes a bit of editing and resizing work to combine all of that footage into a single movie. I use Vegas Studio, or Pinnacle, or Adobe After Effects and Premier, whichever is easier for a particular project. (If you're looking for an easy photo editor with great features, you couldn't go wrong with Sony Vegas Movie Studio 9 Platinum Pro Pack.)All in all, I really liked the video features in the EX-FH100, and I'm excited to see how Casio evolves this line of cameras. Could you use this as a sole camera for amateur to prosumer level nature photography/videography, or if you're on a trip and want to carry just one camera? I think so, particularly if you have suitable image and video editing software.For this camera, I also purchased the Maximal Power DB CAS NP90 Replacement Battery, a cheap knock off that works as well as the Casio battery, and has functioned well for me over 100 hours of nature photography. It properly fits the camera, fits the charger, has an equivalent battery life. As for the camera's battery power usage, I think it's great. I get a full 6-8 hour fieldtrip of photos, HD video, and slow-motion video from a single charge, so Casio is to be commended for remarkably efficient use of resources with its camera engineering.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "This is my 1st digital camera purchase, won't be needing another for a long time", "Author": "Bbert Freezefryer", "ReviewID": "R2LK25U2V8H8RP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the 1st digital camera I've purchased and I'm blown away by how great this camera performs.

When the camera arrived, I noticed that it had a cool design and it wasn't nearly as bulky as the pictures made it appear.  The camera was extremely easy to use.  I am 13 years old and I could easily figure out how to use it.  If you are new to photography just keep the mode on \"BS\" mode.  I started out using \"BS\" mode, but then changed to \"M\" mode because I realized that you can make the photos turn out much better in manual mode.THESE ARE THE BASIC THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT \"M\" MODE:The higher the ISO, the lighter the picture.The lower the F (aperture), the more light the lens lets in.The slower the shutter speed, the more light the shutter lets in.If your shutter speed is too fast, the indoor pictures will be underexposed.You can change the shutter speed up to 1/40,000 in slow motion mode and up to 1/10,000 in HD mode; in the rapid fire picture mode you can make the shutter go to 1/40,000 of a second.SHUTTER SPEED AND FRAME RATE ARE DIFFERENT.Shutter speed is how long the shutter is is open, and frame rate is how many pictures per second the camera takes.The picture quality is good and the stereo mic is really good, and the 10x optical zoom is great. I noticed that some people said that the screen was low quality, but I think it is actually decent.  I wouldn't use it for manual focus; I'd stick with auto focus, but it's not bad.The slow motion mode is amazing.  This is the main reason why I bought this camera.

Best Shot, the ability to merge to made a sort of HDR photo on the fly....As others have noted the RAW capacity is unusable.  It will shoot raw but it is slow loading and preparing for a next photo.  But if you can be happy with a LARGE JPEG and the flexibility to shoot in all modes...aperture, shutter, manual... you'll like this cost effective black box.That is all saying NOTHING about it's ability to shoot slow motion video which I hope to montage with the HD video I can get with my Canon 5DM2.I suspect the disappointed people in previous reviews did not know how to actually work the camera.

I've been trying to capture our resident hummingbird on film in slow motion but haven't been lucky enough yet.The camera takes high quality still film in the basic mode,  sharp, true color photos. The 'best shot' option allows you to choose from many common scene settings, including high resolution and slow motion video modes. Since I'm not exactly a techie, I appreciate this feature. The fast shutter speed action mode captures great photos of running kids and dogs, gives you the option to choose the best expression/position of the lot and erase the rest. This option works extremely well but uses up a lot of memory so isn't for everyday use when you won't be able to download pictures or recharge the battery frequently.I'm not a big fan of the zoom toggle. It's jerky and continues after you've stopped pushing on it making it hard to fine tune.  A gentle touch works well, but this is the one feature I've had problems with.The slow motion video does not work well in low light or inside. Not a problem for me, as I plan to use it primarily for outdoor activities, but one caveat. Also super slow motion video is somewhat useless and has such a small pixel size it's an option I have rarely used.Overall, the colors come through very well, photos are sharp and focused. There is a learning curve to this camera, more so than the basic point and shoot, but the features I needed, including relatively fast start up time, sharp video, fast shutter speed for action shots, long lasting battery (three days and lots of video during a remote wedding) and a high powered zoom are all superb.

Frankly, I like point and shoots, the F30 pics I took in 2008 in Croatia still are among the best quality in any light I've ever shot.

It has an amazing array of features, remarkably fast rapid sequencing, all sorts of cool \"best pic\" settings.  It takes a lot of getting used to.  As a P & S it works very well.  So why did I downgrade it?  Well, first of all, there's no manual.  IT is all online and you have to download it, and it is a very complicated little camera.  Second, the monitor screen is actually kind of lousy, and for several weeks every picture I took, I kept showing my girlfriend and asking - \"is it me, or is this really unsharp?  Is this fuzzy?\"  I thought about sending it back several times.  But when I downloaded the pictures, the colors and resolution were terrific.  but THIRD, I got to send it back anyway, because right after I returned from a vacation, the shutter release and zoom broke.  Completely.  I was out shopping and saw an amazing sunset, whipped out the Casio, and dead as a doornail.  IT would turn on, but wouldn't zoom, and wouldn't expose.

I decided to look into a new Point and Shoot.  We are a typical family, do a little travelling, kids sports and the usual so wanted something to find something that would fit.  It came down to this camera and the Sony DSC-HX5V, or GPS VS burst photos.  The $100 difference made this more appealing, so placed my order.I have had the camera for a few weeks now and it really is a great camera for a family.  The picture quality is great, it is quick and the 10X optical Zoon rally lets you zoom in on the daughters  Soccer moments.  The Best shot mode actually have some very useful modes I have never seen in another camera.  The ability to hold down the shutter, taking photos until after the moment is great, stops you trying to guess when to snap the candles being blown out, the little girl kicking the ball or the entry into the pool.The Night shots using the multiple photos stitched into one created some great results, if you can take one of those and one with auto, it gives you two very different photos, but you will find something to like in each of them.  The HD Video is nice, stereo mic helps sound.  it would be nice to zoom in and out, but nothing is perfect.  I would like to have seen the slow motion modes been in 16:9.  I understand that the image quality is lower, but the HD video is WS.  The slow motion video is fun, things just seem more entertaining slowed down.This is a really great camera for a great price.  The ability to really capture action moments, great night shots and quick and simple use for the wife, makes this a winner.", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Time Phased Review", "Author": "John Miller", "ReviewID": "R1BJFNQXTKDEBY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the $250 camera, Casio EX-FH100, 11/15/2010 from Amazon at a premium price of $16, exclusive of shipping cost, over that offered by Portable Guy (PG). I have had excellent service in the past, using Amazon. They replaced a defective 42 inch LCD TV at zero cost to me. I have not used PG and have no experience with them, although it's customer service ratings are excellent.The camera should be delivered at no cost in two days on 11/17, using a zero cost trial subscription to Amazon Prime.I looked a variety of reviews, primarily imaging-resource.com and dpreview.com. I looked at the reviews by fellow customers for this and many other cameras. All camera manufacturer customer services have horror stories about them, so picking a camera based on one being more response than another did not enter into my decision making process. Quality control at manufacturing facilities appears to be horrible. Customer service will probably leave you banging your head against the wall. Whether you get a good camera or not is more luck than anything else.I weighed the cost of the camera against a wide range of cameras. Cost was not a significant deciding factor. However, it does not make sense to buy a throwaway item, which is expensive. (I considered Fuji FinePix HS10 10 MP CMOS 30X for $368, but it had horrible customer reviews and was a much larger camera. I also considered the Nikon D5000, but avoided it because of its large size and 3X standard lens.)Small cameras with small sensors CCD or CMOS don't have the ability to produce large perfect color pictures. To get those you need to part with major bucks, like $11K for a Mamiya. Excellent photo quality is only available on large CMOS or film based DSLRs. I don't own one and am not interested in carrying one around, as I did when I owned an old fashioned Minolta SLR.I wanted a real pocket camera. I had a Sony H20, which was not pocketable unless you have really big pockets. I don't take videos, so the quality of those and consumer comments about those were not considered in my camera selection.A highly rated Canon S95 is about the same size as the FH100, but it is 3.8X, costs about 50% more than the FH100, and had to many negative consumer comments about it. Panasonic's DMC-ZS series are plagued with hardware problems. Negative write-ups exceeded a level that I was comfortable with. The $171 ZS1 is the best buy unless you want to take movies of limited value and want a GPS, which drains you battery. The 12X camera appears to take sharper photos, but with hardware problems I did not want to bother with it. The top of line ZS7, which is a ZS1 with bells and whistles, runs $258 from Amazon. A number of `nice on paper' cameras did not make the cut, based on customer reviews about faulty equipment.I wanted a camera with a zoom in the 5X to 10X range. Larger zooms come with larger photography and equipment problems.Why Casio? It was probably more a whim of the moment than anything else was.Big factors in selecting the FH100 were:Long battery lifeCMOS sensorManual control - ISO, Aperture, and Shutter SpeedBest Shot photo process - the camera takes 5 photos and merges them to give the best shot or you can select amongst the five.High Speed Burst PhotosPhysical size - roughly 3/4 inch longer and 3/8th inch wider than a pack of Marlboro and just about the same thickness.I wanted a camera, which would be delivered before Friday. My super hot girl friend and I are going gambling Saturday through Monday. I want to take photos of her playing the slots. The ambient light in casinos (L'Auberge and Delta Downs in Lake Charles, Louisiana) varies from marginal to really dark. She is 70 and I am 65.I downloaded the FH100 user manual. It is 203 pages long. I have scanned it. The electronic manual is exceptionally well written and comprehensive. The options available to the photographer, using this camera, are mind boggling. I question anyone's negative comments about the picture quality of this camera, unless they have read and understand the whole manual and have experimented with the options available.The FH100 is not in my opinion meant to be a simple point and shoot camera. It can be used that way, but I'll bet that will not get you the best pictures that the camera can take.I'll get back to this review and adjust my star rating, as necessary, based on my experience with it, considering my limited knowledge of the camera and its capabilities.Day 1First photo experiences with the Casio EX-FH100 - Transcend 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6E installed.Charged battery, bought $10 case and $10 travel tripod, formatted SDHC card.Two test photosAmazon1 = 1.41MB JPG reduced to 240KB via MS Digital Image Pro 10Hand held Ambient light - computer monitor and lighted painting behind photographer (that positioning accounts for shadows left and center bottom of the photo.

At first I thought there are some hidden controls that I would need to get access to to improve the picture quality. I simply could not believe the water color images I was getting at the lowest IS0 100 setting. I searched in vain for a setting to turn off noise reduction. The camera's shutter lag was so unacceptable (at least 1 seconds from pressings it) that I was totally unable to get any sort of shots where the subject (my son) was moving even a little. Granted, I was not expecting picture qualities even close to my Sony A700 DSLR, but I was certainly expecting better images than my very old Fuji f10 (6 megapixel camera). Flash pictures were even worse. There were so many strange colors and secondary artifacts in all the shots I took, that I was quite taken back. Interestingly, this camera has remarkable low-light performance, and even at ISO 3200, the pictures look only a little more water colored than at base ISO. The video performance was not bad, in that they looked relatively decent, and the stereo microphone is definitely a nice touch. However, even though the zoom functions during video recording, the lack of focusing makes taking sharp videos of moving subjects nearly impossible, especially when they are closing or receding. I got this camera for it's high speed video capabilities, but the quality of still images was so remarkably low that I simply could not justify this camera at $300.

It came with a lengthy instruction book written in multiple languages (perhaps 20) but which was certainly inadequate in English.  There was also a set of abbreviated instructions in English. When I examined these I discovered that the shutter release is significantly delayed for auto-focus, and that the camera makes a beeping noise with each shot.  Both the long and short instructions were utterly silent about how to bypass or correct these two common functions important to me and to, I assume, many buyers - to be able to take non-posed pictures quickly and to take pictures silently.  Additionally, both sets of instructions were totally silent about a timer function for self-shots when say, out hiking alone or with a friend and no one around to take the picture. I eventually learned all of the above is possible - but to find out how to do these very basic functions I had to run the included CD on a computer, or use a computer to download same.  I don't usually carry a laptop along when taking pictures.A teckie would probably just push a few buttons and self-teach or intuitively figure out such things, but for those who need instructions to sort out all the tiny buttons and bells and whistles, it is, well, to quote another reviewer about the similar situation with a different camera, \"this is quite simply unacceptable for a camera with this many features and which requires extensive study of the manual to truly master. And I shouldn't have to go to the expense of printing out 150+ pages to make up for this cost-cutting scheme.\" Perhaps this is a common situation these days?  So I returned the Casio and learned a lesson which cost me one-third of the purchase cost in return fees, insurance, etc.My solution?  Either buy a new version of a product one already knows how to operate (I went back to a Panasonic, specifically the updated LUMIX DMC-ZS6.) or pay a little more and shop directly in a real store where you can examine the camera and its manual and functions.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't drop it!

I spent a lot of time going through reviews on point and shoot cameras and decided on this model. I really liked it while I had it.

It never really slid out but rather would get hung up as I struggled to pull the camera out. I also found myself accidentally turning on the camera when retrieving it from my pocket as their are some dedicated shooting mode buttons on it that if pressed can turn the camera on. The build quality seemed solid enough but I dropped it once and that was $240.00 down the drain. The lens wouldn't retract back into the camera and it was a painful lesson.
