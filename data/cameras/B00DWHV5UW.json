Before I receive the merchandise, the price dropped by Amazon and B&H; camera. I contact this seller but they replied that they don't do price adjustment and said \"Not all camera dealers pay the same price for an item\". Well... I bought thru Amazon and expect price match as Amazon does. If it is true that \"Not all camera dealers pay the same price for an item\" as they said, we need to check the seller before purchase.I paid $19.95 for original shipping and the shipping charge was over $50 to return. I chose 'the peace of mind' and keeping the camera by loosing $80~130. I don't want to buy another camera before the fund is cleared completely by Cameta Camera. It is already Dec.14. and I don't want to miss this Christmas without a good camera that I anticipated to have. It is very important to look at the seller. It was my first time to buy camera worth $1449.95. I should've researched more about the seller.The accessory included in this package is not bad but there are always good deals and freebies from Amazon and B&H.;", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,579.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 13 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Canon EOS 70D Digital SLR Camera & EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Lens + <2> Canon 2400 DSLR Camera Case + <3> Transcend 64GB SDXC 10 Card +\n<4> Spare LP-E6 Battery + <5> Precision Design 67mm (UV/CPL/ND8) Filters + <6> RC-6 Shutter Remote Control +\n<7> Precision Design DSLR300 Flash + <8> Precision Design 58\" Tripod + <9> PD HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable +\n<10> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <11> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <12> LCD Screen Protectors + <13> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet", "Name": "Canon EOS 70D Digital SLR Camera & EF-S 18-135mm IS STM Lens with 64GB Card + Battery + Case + 3 Filters + Flash + Remote + Tripod + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61dE6txsHLL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DWHV5UW"}}
