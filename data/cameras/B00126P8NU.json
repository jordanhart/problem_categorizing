I was turned off by the D40 due to it's 6MP sensor and lack of JPEG (fine) + Raw capabilities. I ended up passing on the Canon Rebel XTI because of the complaints about the low-quality kit lens which would've added costs beyond it's initial price tag.Looking in various photography forums I discovered the Sony Alpha being recommended to other people looking in the same price range I was. It had a 10.1MP sensor, a good lens and was in the same price range as the Rebel XTi. I'm really happy with the purchase. Picture quality is excellent with the kit lens (SAL-1870). I also purchased the SAL-55200 telephoto lens and it is also a very nice lens for the money.The battery life on the camera is excellent. The auto-focus is super fast and delving into the manual a bit will reveal many powerful configuration options (I don't think a lot of the Nikon and Canon fans who are critical of this camera ever did that because I've seen claims made on forums that just aren't true).Some of the myths I've heard:*No Shutter Lock (not true, just set the camera to \"Manual\" mode)*Limited and expensive lens selection (Sony has a pretty decent selection on it's own but this camera can also use many Konica-Minolta lenses dating all the way back to 1985).*Can't use standard flashes (while the Alpha does have a proprietary hot shoe which is lame, there are good adapters out there.Lack of live preview a problem (this comes up a lot and apparently these people have never shot film before. most professionals I know do not need or use live preview)There are many Pros but some that stand out in particular for this class are:*Great bundled software (usually bundled software just sits in the box but the programs that Sony's included are actually quite good)*3200 ISO (this is extremely rare in a camera in this price range)*In camera image stablization*Dynamic Range OptimizationAll in all this camera is actually more in the class of the Nikon D80 as far as image quality goes but at nearly half the price.", "Date": "April 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Great Price!!!", "Author": "Reza K.", "ReviewID": "R3QZY2BEDLV14H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony has really done it. This isn't gonna be a technical review, just what I feel are strong points and weak points of this camera.This is a great camera for beginners of SLR's to learn on but ain't too bad for those of you who know what you are doing. I myself have had film SLR's for many years, this is my first DSLR and cost was a factor for me. I am in no way made of money so the low price really sold me (no pun intended). The features you expect from an SLR are all there, and you can go from full auto to full manual and every point in between in a just a flip of a switch and the pressing of a few buttons to set up your shot.Built in Image Stabilization is a great feature to have, especially when some camera makers build it into the lens, which, in turn, makes your lens prices considerably higher.Some people complain about no live view on the LCD, but I personally prefer no live view. It saves on some battery life and it makes it feel like more of a real camera and less of a point and shoot. If you want live view, wait for the A300KThe camera feels sturdy and isn't too big or small. I have very large hands and the camera feels good in my hands. It is mostly plastic, which in a way can feel a bit cheap but doesn't seem to be a problem at this time.ISO setting is great. If you want to shoot in low light situations you have ISO settings up to 3200 with a supposed noise reduction but I haven't checked that out yet. I personally have it set on 100 and will keep it there for the least amount of noise.Media options are GREAT!!! Sony MemorySticks are ridiculously priced. Especially when you need to have a high capacity one for these big pics (esp. shooting in RAW). Luckily this camera takes CompactFlash cards, which are some of the cheapest one you can get. (I got mine here on Amazon 4GB for $42).The only thing I have a problem with on this camera is that you have to pay an extra $12 for an LCD protector (small plastic cover for LCD screen). Some camera makers include this with their SLR's. Sony should have included this as well.Just don't forget the accessories. It will be nice to get the 70mm-300mm lens (which I got for $229) for those far away and macro shots. Screen protector is $12. Memory will vary by the amount you get. I also bought a nice tripod/monopod for $40.So that's it. With this camera you will be taking very nice pictures, at high resolutions and at a reasonable price. There are very few downfalls in the design, and a lot of extremely nice features. Hope this helps with your decision.", "Date": "April 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "First hands on...very nice entry level DSLR!", "Author": "Hiram Grant \"just call me Sam\"", "ReviewID": "RF5QQZTFVUP2W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been able to handle one of these off and on for several weeks now, and I'm very pleased with the handling and features for such a value price.Compared to the older Alpha 100, this camera is a bit smaller, but not so much that a person would find it \"too small\" for their hands.  It uses the same, full sized battery as the other current Alphas, including the now top-of-the-line Alpha 700.  Additionally, it can be made bigger by adding the vertical grip (although this might make it a bit too large for some).Typical of the Alpha series, the LCD is very good quality, and, when set to the larger type size, easily readable by older eyes.Autofocus speed has definately been improved over the A100, and all performance levels seem to be at least as good, most improved to various degrees (but you'll notice the AF most).Features that are lacking are a wireless remote option; depth-of-field preview; and a quick AF/MF (autofocus/manual focus) button or setting.  Then again, there aren't any other cameras this inexpensive with a 9-point AF system, built-in anti-shake, and 10 megapixels!  You should value the anti-shake as at least $100 bucks for every lens you plan on purchasing!A decision to make might not be which camera brand to buy, but which model.  The Alpha 300 will have the same features as the 200, but will add the articulated LCD with Live View, for an extra $100.  Personally, my experience with this feature on the Alpha 350 says, to me, it is worth $100.  You get the same 2.7\" LCD, but now it articulates.  The Live View works great (no autofocusing lag like other brands), and allows a live, digital crop of 1.4x or 2x.  [The Live View feature does have one drawback the way Sony uses it.  It only shows 90% of the entire image].All-in-all, this is a fine camera at a GREAT price!Here's some accessories you might find useful:Sony PCK-LH2AM LCD Protector Cover Type for Sony A200 DSLRSony VG-B30AM Vertical Grip for Sony Alpha A200 DSLR", "Date": "March 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "AF Illuminator???

I sent it to the service center in Laredo TX, They told me there was corrosion on one of the boards and it was'nt covered by the warranty.Wow...was I dissapointed , They gave me the option to repair it for $350.00 or trade it in for a new camera ....I opted to upgrade to the A300 for $347.00 (Duh!) .My point ....These cameras should be able to withstand some drops of sweat...we do take photos in the heat.....so take extra care of yours ...unless u want to upgrade to the A300 Hahahah. Another expensive lesson for me..........I'm looking forward to the A300 it should be arriving by early next week. hopefully the live view will minimize sticking my face on the camera while sweating........hahaha.

C. Henss Jr.", "ReviewID": "R3CZ75QBP1KXRX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used a wide variety of film SLRs and digital point-and-shoot cameras before. The Sony A-200K is by far the finest I've used.I simply haven't found anything this camera can't do--and that's a surprise, given its teeny-tiny flash. Indoors or out, pictures are invariably sharp and well-lit. (Letting the camera make the decisions has worked well to date; I haven't needed to get into the manual settings.) The 18-70 mm lens is lightweight, amazingly sharp, and, at a 35 mm equivalent of 27 mm to 105 mm, is an almost ideal range for around-town and travel use. Built in image stabilization (Super Steady Shot) and sensor self-cleaning are features you don't get in comparable Nikon or Canon models.One of the major selling points of this camera is its backward compatibility with Minolta Maxxum film lenses and flashes. This means that lenses can be acquired inexpensively, on Craigslist or elsewhere--to evaluate a lens for your needs, just multiply its focal length by 1.5. I haven't yet tried my very complicated Maxxum 5400xi flash with this camera, but Sony says it will work.Dollar for dollar, there's no better entry-level SLR on the market today. I'm thrilled with this camera.", "Date": "May 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "Robert Field", "ReviewID": "R34YLREUL838J3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is really an excellent camera.  I definitely don't consider myself an expert in DSLRs (I have only spent time shooting with Nikon D200, D70, and Canon Rebel XTi), but I've been very pleased with this one so far.Image quality is extremely comparable to the Rebel XTi, except in the greens, where it appear to be superior.  Noise reduction is where the Sony sort of fails- low ISO noise is very acceptable, and definitely on a par with the Canon, possibly even better depending on the image.  Once you get up to ISO 1600 the Canon appears superior and the Sony is beginning to look fairly noisy- check out sample images on camera comparison sites to see if it's acceptable to you.  ISO 3200 results in very noisy images, but frankly the Canon can't hit 3200 anyway, so at least there's that!  In short, at low ISOs the Sony holds it's own or slightly exceeds it's competitors, at high ISOs it looks worse, but at the same time it's capable of hitting ISO 3200 whereas the competition isn't.  Kind of a toss up, I guess.The kit lenses are about what you'd expect- a little soft, but overall not something the average user is likely to complain about.  Image distortion and chromatic aberation don't really appear to be a significant issue.  They're decent lenses, overall, definitely comparable to the kit lenses you'd get from any other maker.Battery life so far is totally acceptable.  The Dynamic Range Optimization isn't as powerful as I'd like, but does work and is actually fairly cool.  The in-camera image stabilization is truly a great feature, and works well.  From what I've seen it maybe buys you two speeds' slower shooting that without it.The thing that really sets this camera apart from the others I've played with is accesibility- it's truly easy to use.  I mostly got this camera for my wife, who's interested in SLR photography but generally unfamiliar with it.  She's had absolutely no trouble or intimidation in picking up and learning the camera quickly.Overall a very good little camera that's an excellent choice for learning and having fun with, and is also capable of taking great pictures in experienced hands.", "Date": "June 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "I simply cannot BELIEVE this kit is priced so cheap!", "Author": "Method2Madness \"Alex\"", "ReviewID": "RIB1V8K2CVZNW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Prequel: I am coming from a strict Nikon background and due to having my $4000 kit(D80, 3 VR, 3 2.8 pro lenses, etc) stolen out of my car, am starting all over again.That being said, I don't have $4000 to plop down at once, so I decided to get an \"entry to mid-level\" system and after many internal battles, decided to try something different and go with the Alpha system. My thoughts were if things didn't work out with this setup, I haven't spent that much and could use it for a carry-around camera. So far I see absolutely NO reason to go back to Nikon. Yes, this system is THAT good.First off, the built-in Image Stabilization(Super Steady Shot) works wonders. I was able to hand hold the camera at a shutter speed of 1/5th of a second with an ISO of 400 and still get usable output.Second, the kit lens is actually pretty darn good! There are some signs of CA(purple fringing) and softness wide open, but they are kept to a minimum. This lens is CERTAINLY better than the kit lens offered with the XT and Xti (I haven't had a chance to try out the XSi kit yet) and equivalent to the excellent 18-55mm Nikon kit lens(The De facto of kit lenses). Not to mention the image quality the body brings to the table! I have printed out and framed a picture taken at (ASA) ISO 1600! Now don't get me wrong, theres noise at that level, but its nothing like the 1st gen, a100. Of course, it goes without saying, lower ISO shots are very vivid and sharp.Lastly, the menu structure and usability are second to none.

I've wanted to move up to a DSLR for some time and now was the perfect time seeing as the prices for many of the entry level cameras has come down significantly in the past few years.It was really a toss-up between this and the Nikon D60.  I threw the decision to some of my photo friends who initially laughed at Sony (one of them actually said, \"Sony makes TVs...would you buy a car from a skateboard company?\"  The Nikons are very popular at the moment, but I've had luck with Sony products--computers, camcorders, and yes, tv's--so I figured to give the Sony a shot.I've really had a great experience with the camera thus far.  I was able to get some great shooting time this weekend as there was a large festival at my campus and many of the shots came out great.  For some night shots I wish I'd brought my tripod, but overall the shots were really great.I feel that this camera has a good balance of features--auto modes and presets that are actually pretty good as well as really intuitive manual controls--AND it takes Minolta lenses (for more info on this, do a quick google search).  The camera is light compared to regular film SLRs or other DSLRs, but it still feels very substantial.Though they're not specific to Sony cameras, RAW images are great to work with.  As one webpage put it, working with RAW images is like having a film negative to work with (in photoshop, iphoto, etc) whereas jpegs are like having a flat print.  If you're into photoshop or other types of digital enhancing/manipulation, RAW format is the way to go.

As I did my research, I did notice that this model has won good reviews all around, even though it is considered a basic entry-level model in the SLR market.The pictures I've taken so far have been nicely exposed and sharp. But you would expect that. So what's not to like?1. Shortage of third party accessories. You can't get a cheap flash from, say, Sunpak like you used to for the old Minolta cameras. I haven't found a definitive yea or nay on whether the Minolta flashes work with the Sony.2. Proprietary battery. Sony will take you to the cleaners when it is time to replace your (rechargeable) battery. I could buy batteries for the old Maxxum for less than ten dollars.3. You won't be mistaken for a pro. But that's OK because you probably aren't one, otherwise you'd be buying the high end Nikons and Canons.4. People stepping up from point and shoots -- note you won't be able to use the LCD screen as a \"viewfinder\". This is because of the mechanics of how an SLR works. Regardless there are other models (more expensive) within the Sony range that work around this limitation.Overall I'm happy with what I got.

Some reviews said it was too plasticky but I think it's a pretty solid unit. The kits lens don't have that nice solid, rubbery grip like more expensive lenses but for starting out they are absolutely fine. Some other reviews said the images produced by the kit lens are a little on the soft side, but I thought they were pretty darn sharp.If you are new to DSLR like me and stepping up from a regular point & shoot camera or 35mm SLR camera then this is absolutely a good choice. The camera body itself has enough features to keep you busy and experimenting such as using Aperture and Shutter priority (I'm too afraid to try manual mode just yet!) and it will give you plenty of opportunity to upgrade to better lenses in the future as your expertise grows.Overall this is a great camera that produces beautiful images.

Also, the additional lenses are a great bargain - being able to do both macro and zoom shots by swapping out a lens is nice after being limited to specific zooms.

I prefer SD cards but there are quite a few CF to SD adapters so that's not much of an issue.I don't have much experience with the supplied software as I prefer to take the memory card and put it directly into my laptop instead of using a USB transfer.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great DSLR for the price!", "Author": "M.

This camera is sized well for someone with big hands but the camera has plenty of features and quality for any hobbyist or beginning DSLR photographer. I bought the kit with the 18-70 and 70-300 lenses and I couldn't be happier. I would recommend getting a second battery for the camera and eventually investing in an accessory flash. the pop flash is adequate for casual shooting but a good accessory flash will greatly improve the quality of your indoor and low light pictures. My next investment is going to be a prime 50mm lens since the kit lens has an f stop of 3.5 which doesn't give you as much flexibility for low light shooting. Overall, a great product at a great price. Highly recommend. The 300 is the same camera but with live view.

I made some excellent photos with that camera, but was unimpressed with the construction quality and the quality of the pictures taken under fluorescent light. Otherwise, it took excellent indoor and outdoor shots. Moved on to Canon. Talk about impressed...nowhere in 35mm photography could you find a better combination of meter and lens! Tack sharp lenses that gave VERY detailed shots of greenery, true to life color registers and a construction quality to rival Hasselblad's! Something happened to BOTH Canons I had! It was like they were cursed, so my next purchase was a Nikon FM.So, let's leap ahead to 1985, and back to Minolta. The Maxxum 7000 comes out, and I can't resist this camera that does everything but go up to the subject and tell it to say \"Cheese!\". Autofocus, motor-driven, auto-rewind, aperture preferred, shutter-preferred, match-needle AND program modes!! Interchangeable Fresnel screens, facility to enlarge battery source, all for about $300.00!! What I had was a Nikon FTN with all the fixins' for about one third the price! Served me beautifully until, after 20-some years, it started to show its wear. So, I perused the 'net to see what was for sale and saw a Maxxum 50 for the unbelievable price of $164...INCLUDING the lens!! Got it. A definite improvement over my old 7000 at half the price!Then disaster! After merging with Konica...Minolta gets out of the photographic camera business! However, they pretty much sell all their rights to Sony, and Sony proceeds to produce a line of excellent DSLRs that use the Minolta AF lens mount. Wanting to go beyond just the regular point and shoot viewfinder digitals, I buy a Sony a200K and couldn't be happier! The shots I've taken so far look like something out of a 4X5 view or \"ideal format\" medium format camera. VERY sharp! The feature that really has me fascinated is the way the LCD menu will adjust to the way you're holding the camera, from vertical to 90 degrees off axis....VERY thoughtful feature! The battery's ability to be charged even if it's not totally depleted is nice, too! Anti-shake, an in-camera dust-cleaning feature, 10.2 megapixels....shutter/aperture priorities, match-needle and program......I'M IN HOG HEAVEN!!

Hessler", "ReviewID": "R2M4DD27QCBLF5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera marks my entry into the Digital Camera age.  I take too many photos on vacations and it costs a fortune to develop them, so I decided to get a dSLR.  After much debating, I ended up getting this camera because I found it for a good price and my existing lens (from my older cheap Minolta SLR) were compatible with it.  By no means did I buy this because it was a superior camera.  Rather, according to reviews, it held its own with the competition and had some options others didn't.I recently finished my vacation and after viewing the images, I am quite happy with the performance.  The first real test for the camera was an aquarium.  Obviously, one doesn't want to use a flash while walking through an aquatic tunnel.  The camera, however needed too much time to take a shot, so I, cautiously changed the ISO to 1600 and 3200 and took some pics.  While obviously suffering from some grain, I was really pleased with the image quality.  Certainly good enough for the Internet or a 4x6 photograph.  I will note that the ISO button makes changing the ISO very easy.The next test is the dynamic range required for waterfalls.  I'm still developing my craft for photography, I'm hardly a pro, but I generally had good efforts taking waterfall shots with this camera.  Some waterfalls were very difficult to photograph, however, because I was underexposed in some regions and overexposed in others.  I have read that RAW versions of photos have more dynamic range, however, I haven't tested that out yet.  Overall, I was pleased with who the camera could do with waterfalls.The next test was rapid photo taking.  I took a series of shots using the continuous advance of people going down a log flume ride.  I was very pleased with the very rapid photo capturing.  To be able to choose between continuous advance or single frame or delay, was very simple with a button up on top of the camera.  The one thing I wish the camera had was a 3 sec delay in addition to the 10 sec delay.  While the 10 sec is good for being able to get oneself into a shot, it is a pain and hassle to use when taking long shutter exposures.As others have noted, you will need to buy a plastic cover for the camera's LCD screen.  You can get it at Amazon or Sony.  It needs to be protected.  The cover is easy to put on, not too hard to take off, but it shouldn't fall off by accident.  Another issue I found was that for the lens that comes with the camera, if you shot at 18 mm and use a normal filter, you very well could get blacks edges in the corner.  I will probably need to get a thinner polarizer filter to prevent that.I have found the battery lasts a good long time and it was never an issue of running out during the day.  I would typically need to charge it once every few days of taking lots of photos (roughly 1250 over a week).  The camera takes an Compactflash so you can get a good amount of memory without the hassle of it being as expensive as other media and the Compactflash media is standardized to continued growing in capacity and is more rugged than other media types.Overall, the camera has performed very very well for me as an entry level dSLR.  The camera does not have HDR capability, it can't make movies.  At the entry dSLR level, you really need to figure out what you need.  Some cameras perform better in some ways but poorer in other ways.  It would probably be best to check out [...] and spend a good while reading through their comprehensive reviews to see which brand or model may better suit you.

Where i live there are no camera stores, so that wahy i decided on the pawn shops.  After a few visits i found one shop that had the Sony and a Nikon.  The sony came with a 70-300mm tele-macro lens, and the kit lens, plus a new camera bag.

If you want to carry more weight to have the perception of more quality, go for another SLR.(+) Better kit-lens.The 18-70mm is versatile enough to use it as your one and only lens, compared to the common 18-55mm kit-lenses. And it's incredible lightweight too. Spice it up with a Sigma 70-300mm for about $150 and you're all set (btw, that is one of the best tele- and macro-lenses you can get for the money!). Quality of the lens is okay, keeping in mind that all zoom lenses can't mess with prime lenses in terms of picture quality. An 18-200mm Tamron would be an alternative, but it makes a lot of distortion in wide-angel - had that one.(+) Compatible with Minolta System.You can use the old Minolta lenses. Bought a Minolta prime lens 28mm f2.8 with AutoFocus for $110 used. Works like a current Sony lens with full automode support, no difference (and it really makes sharp, crisp pics!). While the use of old film-era lenses is not a Sony/Minolta-only phenomenon, I have the feeling, people are less fighting for this stuff as Sony is not extremely common in the SLR sector, compared to Canon or Nikon. So you are more likely to get a good deal with the old Minolta stuff.(+) Extra ISO Button.Easy to reach, this is not absolutely common in the entry-level segment.CONS:(-) The stupid eye-start.Well, what Sony sells as a feature is the most annoying, stupid thing ever. Imagine, a camera hanging at your neck will never ever shut off because your belly keeps the eye-sensor active all the time. And you can not deactivate this feature. Technically you can turn it off in the menu, but that has no consequences: The camera will stay alive forever if you wear it. I'm so annoyed that I have to keep a safety distance to the damn sensor for about a minute to let the cam shut off by itself.(-) On/Off Switch.Most cameras have their on/off switch on the right side where you can operate it with your index finger = shutter finger is able to turn the cam off without using your other hand. Not so this one which is on the left side. Combined with the eye-start issue it's the result of stupid product design.(-) JPEG Compression.The camera is compressing the JPEG-Quality images even in finest quality setting slightly too much. It's not really bad, though. As I'm shooting in RAW most of the time, this is not a problem for me and I think most of the people buying an entry-level SLR wouldn't even notice that. Picture quality of this one is nice anyway!(-) Bracket limit of 0,7.Bracket shooting mode enables you to shoot 3 pics with different exposure in a row while keeping the shutter button pressed. In other words, it will produce e.g. 1 underexposed pic, 1 normal pic, 1 overexposed pic. Great for post-producing HDR pictures. You can set the range of how strong the under-/overexposure is. Unfortunately unlike other D-SLRs, the Sony A-200 is limited to 0,7. \"Why?\" I would like to scream at a Sony designer. My old Pentax was able to make a bracket with up to -2/0/+2. A range of 0,7 is so ridiculous that you totally can forget about this feature.I have to admit though, that most of the people buying this cam will never use this special feature.(-) High ISO.Okay, this is not only a problem with Sony. I read the manufacturers and consumers highlighting the awesome ability to shoot with ISO 3200. Forget about anything beyond ISO 800, pics will look terribly noisy. To make great pictures with ISO 3200 or even 1600, you need to spend $1600 or more for a prosumer or pro SLR. No matter what, those entry level SLR produce a lot of noise even at ISO 800 (though this is still acceptable). Maybe in a few years.In ISO Auto mode the cam will not go beyond ISO 400 anyway - I guess that's because Sony know that the pics aren't looking that smooth anymore beyond ISO 400...The Sony A-200 is a good choice, but I don't know if I would rather go with a Nikon D40 instead. I got a great deal one year ago and I don't regret buying it. But again, I think the D40 makes better pics, though it is more heavy and the kit lens needs more desperately to be replaced than the Sony kit lens.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "For the price and options, there is no better deal!", "Author": "J.

I can only imagine that a consumer that does their research will be skeptical of Sony because of their relative obscurity.I bought the a200 because it was the least expensive starter DSLR with the most features. I can say that this camera is exactly what I was looking for, with just about every feature that I need, all wrapped up in an interface that's easy to use. When you first start out using a DSLR camera, the number of things you can control in full manual mode can be overwhelming. On the a200, all the image settings are presented to you in an easy-to-understand display, with individual buttons and dials that control all the exposure and focus settings. Moreover, the in-body image stabilization and AF motor are great features too. Compare this to the Nikon D40, where both the image stabilization and the AF motor are built into the lens.As for the image quality, I really can't complain. Since I'm still new to digital photography (my last SLR camera was a Minolta x370 from the 80's), I was blown away by how clear the images were. I could take a picture of a restaurant from across the street, and still be able to read the size 16 font on their menus posted in the window when I downloaded the images to my computer.The only complaints I have about this model are the software and the lack of live view. The included software is mediocre, at best, and is only really useful for converting the camera's RAW images to TIFFs or JPEGs when you shoot in RAW mode.

It turns out that when you click on the shutter and activate the timer, the camera focuses and doesn't adjust the focus anymore. This may sound trivial but if you happen to be in front of the camera when you press the shutter button it'll focus on you up close and then it won't adjust the focus again when the field changes.

There is a pop up flash that senses low light. You can put it on all automatic; focusing, light metering or you can go creative and make your own settings. This is a very versitile camera that is great for the beginner or for the advanced photographer because there are so many possibilities. This takes creative photography to the max! I love this camera, my camera, and would recommend it to anyone!", "Date": "March 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Nice DSLR", "Author": "Steven Klimasewski", "ReviewID": "RFMFZJ6O52V0Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera close to a year now and absolutely love it! I have looked at the Canon and Nikon as well as Olympus competitors and I choose this one over the others and I am happy with my decision. ( note I have also extensively used the Canon XS for about a year now and IMHO does not even come close the the performance or quality of the Sony A200 )Battery: Battery life is outstanding I have never had it die on me even once sometimes I could go a few days without even charging it ( taking a few hundred shots each day ) In general I get about 600 without flash and about 200-300 with flashKit Lens : The kit lens is surprisingly well built and has a surprisingly good quality. When compared to the canon XS's standard kit lens ( 18-55mm ) the build quality is much higher and the sharpness throughout the range is much higher then that of other kit lenses I have used.Lenses In General: one of the things I hear the most commonly from company biased employees at camera stores when trying to lore people away from less common brands like Sony is on the lack of lens options. This is simply not true I would not consider myself a pro but an advanced amateur, though I do know some pros who use Sony and agree that there is every lens you will ever need on the Sony camera's unless you do specialized photography ( like microscope photography or telescope photography ) you will not be bothered with the lens options sony gives you. Not only will all of the sony lenses work on the camera ( and there are a lot of sony lenses ) but also all of the Monlita lenses will as well and they work just as good and you can find great deals on used Monilta lenses. Not to mention all the major third party lens companies produce lenses for Sony ( Tamron, Sigma etc ) So if you hear someone saying there are not a lot of lens options for the Sony camera system then don't listen to themErgonomics : This was one of the main reasons I choose this because the Canon camera's ( XS,XSI,XTI ) did not fit my hands very well ( I have big hands ) this Sony fit my hands perfect. I would also like to compliment Nikon for having great ergonomics on there cameras as well, the Nikons fit my hand great so it would seem Canon is the only one with ergonomic related problems that I have used and for my hands.Quality  : The Quality is great on this camera and IMO almost identical to the performance of the Nikon D80. The Noise could be a little better but I find it usable to shoot at ISO 1600 if I turn of noise reduction in camera ( built in noise reduction is Horrible and makes the picture worse so turn this off ) and then use a program like Noise Ninja or Dfine ( I prefer Dfine ) if you use one these softwares it will let you use iso 1600 for small prints ( no larger then 8x10 IMO at this ISO ). Also at iso 100 the dynamic range is very good when shooting in Raw I can pull or push about 2 stops ether way without making it look too bad.Features : This camera has a lot of features that are extremely useful like IS ( image stabilization ) since IS is built into the camera every lens benefits  and you don't need to pay extra for IS lenses like you do on NIkon and Canon. It also has dynamic range optimizer so that it pushes the shadows slightly and pulls the highlights slightly. One feature that was included in the A100 that is not in the 200 is Mirror lockup which is disappointing because it would have been very useful ( mirror lockup produces even sharper images by moving the mirror up before as to not shake the camera ).Build Quality: This camera is built very tough! For example about a week after I got it I had it on a tripod about 5 feet from the sidewalk ( yes concrete ) and it fell over when I bumped the tripod, right onto the concrete and all it did was put a scratch on the top of the flash. Not to mention it has been through very moist conditions, I have taken this out unprotected ( probably not smart ) during heavy rain storms and pretty much soaked it and have never had so much as a problem with this camera.All in all this is an amazing camera and IMO the best that you will find under 800 dollars as of right now. Remember you are buying into a system not just an individual camera. One thing that I dislike and hope that sony changes is that this has an unstandard  hotshoe and requires an adapter to work with studio lights or other name brand flashes.Check out samples I have uploaded to Amazon I include one which was shot in 1600 ISO with built in Noise reduction turned off and using Dfine for noise reduction", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "This is one of the best Enter level DSLR camera!", "Author": "Patrick Nguyen \"Trance Music\"", "ReviewID": "R10A8V0YYPVQH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera, this is an excellent camera for outdoor portrait, pictures are awesome, it's a little heavy for small hands.

I was most impressed with the clarity of the a70 images for being less than 4mp.I've yet to read the entire instruction manual for the a200 as I was told the best way to get familiar with the camera was to simply spend time taking photos. I sense this is excellent advice.I'm glad I purchased this model (as well as a warranty) as I plan to take many photos of my friends (and pets) as they're lovely people, and well, animals seem to photograph very well.I am impressed with the number of features on the a200 and I certainly like the anti-shake correction,,,the feature which sold me on this model. I understand that Sony builds the anti-shake feature into the body and most other camera makers build the anti-shake into the lenses?I was tempted to buy the a350 as I have big hands and it has a bigger body, however, the a350 felt like too much camera as I am new to digital photography. I've yet to play around with the ISO feature however, I understand that the ISO rating related to film speed??I'm excited to play around with the features and test my luck with taking black and white photos.I have friend who has a Great Dane and I'm sure she won't mind if I take 20 or 2000 photos of her.

This camera can and will do just about anything you ask it to. For the average person with an average understanding of what each function is used for, one could easily become distracted by all of the bells-and-whistles that this camera has! It lacks nothing to prevent you from creating that perfect shot. It has so many features that if you took the extra time to review each one, your subject will have gotten up and walked away... five minutes ago! The beautiful part of owning a camera such as this one, is that you can practice and practice and practice and not have to shell out any additional cash for developing your prints. As a matter of fact, I would recommend just that. Practice makes perfect, and with this camera you'll be creating professional looking photographs (pics?) in no time. Don't get hung-up on the 10.2 mega-pixel resolution either. Are you going to be composing huge (larger than poster size) prints? Do you work for a large advertising firm who may specify (for some unknown reason) output in RAW, super-resolution format? I'd say more than likely you would answer the last two questions... no! However, you may want to have a non-pixelized, 8 x 10 inch or possibly an 11 x 14 inch print of your family, or your pet, or that beautiful sunset that you've just captured. No problem... this camera will accommodate those wishes with ease.The camera body is basically a revamped, converted-to-digital, cram-in-some-fancy-electronics, auto-focus, Konica-Minolta SLR. As such, you should be able to use most Minolta A mount, AF (auto-focus) OEM (Original Equipment Manufacture) lenses from Minolta, Konica Minolta and Sony! This ability allows you to purchase older lenses and specialty items which will work just fine on your new Sony and at realistic prices! This is a good thing! While the bundled 18 - 70mm, f/3.5 - 5.6 lens (comes with the Alpha 200K) or the 2 lens, 18 - 70mm, f/3.5 - 5.6 PLUS the 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 (comes with the Alpha 200W) are pretty decent in their own right... as you get more and more professional, you will likely want to upgrade to a faster lens. Of course, there are many good aftermarket-type lenses for this Sony, including Carl Zeiss! You may also want to upgrade to a more powerful flash. Be careful here! The hot shoe (flash mount) is proprietary. You can't just buy a universal flash. The OEM flashes are somewhat on the expensive side, but I think it's worth the few extra bucks. If you use the wrong flash, you may end up destroying the camera's flash circuit and possibly the camera itself. Do your homework or ask a pro! I have the Sony HVL-F42AM ($300 new) that I picked-up on eBay as an open-box item for less than half of retail. I'm very pleased with it. It works great and has more adjustments and options on it than I will ever use in my lifetime! The a200 also comes with a neat little feature called the \"Super Steady Shot\" image stabilizer. Have you ever tried to hold the camera steady while trying to photograph your subject which requires a telephoto or zoom lens to bring the image closer? ...or tried to steady the camera when using a long exposure time? Not too easy, is it? Voila! Super Steady Shot electronically freezes the image which prevents the camera shake that just ruined your \"perfect\" shot. You know... it's the one that you worked so hard to capture in the right place and at the right time. This feature can be a life-saver!As you can probably can tell, I really like this camera and would recommend it to anyone! For more info, check out the great websites below.

I generally liked the build, excellent features for the price and the fact that it includes two lenses (18-70 and 75-300). The menus are excellent and the battery life is extremely good.However there are disappointing things also:- ISO800 and above is almost unusable for professional work because of the noise.- In low light situations (indoor and cloudy days) the noise and quality of the photo (white balance and in noise) is sometimes terrible.- Pictures of kit lens 17-70 are disappointing in maximum zoom. Same goes with 75-300.- Photos with flash (automatic mode) are sometimes overexposure and sometimes underexposure.", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "The software killed my computer!!!!

My computer would not restart until it went thru troubleshoot mode. So I tried it again..Like the idiot I am...Then it locked my computer up for good. The only way I could save my computer was with SYSTEM RECOVERY... I lost all my files and started from scratch...Then tried it again..After loading new software for a printer and a Canon camera...With the same result...

The seller was listed as the former when I purchased a Sony alpha a200 Dslr on Amazon, but was listed as EZ Pawn when I returned it through Amazon. That fits. The LCD was damaged, the camera took terrible photos, and it was missing accessories that should be in the kit.  There was no manual, no USB cable, no memory stick for the adaptor, and no protective caps. The camera arrived in three pieces: the body with no protective cap, the18-70 lens with neither a front nor a back cap, and the charger. I spent an additional $35 for a memory card and lens cap.  The LCD was scratched in the center, and images on the screen of photos I took were dark and barely visible.  When I downloaded photos onto my computer, they were dull, dark, and looked like images taken with a cheap camera phone.I am familiar with the Sony alpha a200 DSLR features and what should be in the kit because I bought it new.  Unfortunately, it was stolen along with my backpack.  I love the camera's features and want to replace it, but calling this purchase a \"kit\" in \"very good\" condition is false advertising.
