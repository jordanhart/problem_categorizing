{"Reviews": [{"Title": "SWEET DEAL-GREAT CAMERA", "Author": "Alina C. Green", "ReviewID": "R21PEZDRFITNOI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a volunteer photographer for a website called \"Find A Grave\", a virtual cemetery with world-wide membership. My old camera was a bit heavy, and acting up. With the sun down here in Florida, I have to hold an umbrella to take the shot sometimes. So, I needed something lightweight, with different settings, and no batteries. I thought it was a TALL order, but then I found this little beauty together with all the wonderful accessories, I put it first on my Wish List, and purchased it when it was reduced to only $129.95!...(thanks to an email from Amazon). This little jewel is almost 1/4\" thick, SUPER lightweight, and has settings for color, black/white, sepia, and mixed. Just the other day, I received an additional battery pack. No batteries, just charge the camera and go. The film feature has audio! I am also known as 'Paparazzi Grandma' so, you know I am going to have fun, too!", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "Stephanie", "ReviewID": "R1FUTW9NA7OCLV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really great camera for Hawaii - my only dismay was not being able to make it do actual landscape photos- the long long ones, you know. It would go through the process fine, but when trying to recall images, those landscape ones were never there. good quality, great assortment of things and so lightweight. Plus- purple!", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be happier", "Author": "phire", "ReviewID": "R37C8YA6T42X4H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves!!
