These are both super cameras that have been a boon to my business.  However, like all modern SLRs they are big, heavy, noisy and the automation works for most everything.  I came to photography when cameras were much simpler and actually required a knowledge of how a camera works.  I am glad I did, as to use the DP1 to its full advantage you must know what you are doing.Photography is a passion even in my off time and I wanted something light, small, and quiet for the candids of life that I would always have with me.  The poor image quality, control, and responsiveness of compacts was not what I was looking for.  I briefly considered the M8 but for a non-money making \"fun\" camera it was way too much to spend.  The DP1 filled the bill for me.Why?  You will read complaints about slowness.  If you are a point and shooter, that is correct, and you should avoid this camera.However, if you are a photographer read on.  During my research I read an article written by a Leica user that said he was always ready to shoot by having his camera prefocused and ready to go.  That is the best way to use the DP1 also.  Use manual focus and the correct aperture for your expected depth of focus needs.  Unlike any other compact camera you can both turn off the lcd and the sleep mode and walk around with the camera ready to shot in an instant.  Of course with the lcd off you will need the optional viewfinder.I normally shoot in A mode and the controls allow fast changes to aperture and exposure compensation, something else no other compact camera does.The image quality at ISO 100 is astounding and loses some quality as it goes up to ISO 800.  800 is somewhat disappointing as color saturation drops off dramatically.Yes it is slow for point and shooters and has a lousy lcd but if that is sacrifices Sigma had to make for a superior image from a compact camera at this price point its fine with me.  I am having a blast with this camera as it opens up a whole new world of image possibilities.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has a photography style that suits a M8 but does not want to spend a fortune for the tool to do it with.  Its not a M8 of course but a bargain in comparison.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Perfect for Urban and Personal Diary Photography", "Author": "Chris Kitze", "ReviewID": "R1MZ62TLW5SLH0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a high end digital camera for street or personal diary work, this might be it.  It's more expensive than other high end \"point and shoots\", but this is much more like a digital Leica M3, than a consumer level p+s.  I mainly do fine art photography in urban settings, here's a link to a monograph of my latest work The Electric Image so you have an idea of the kind of shooting I do.Start with the sensor, the Foveon 14 megapixel gives you color fidelity that other digital cameras can't touch.  It's great to have this in such a small package.  The camera is extremely compact and while you might think the 16.6mm fixed focus lens (28mm equiv. on 35mm camera) is limiting, it is perfect for urban street shooting.  The lens quality is very good and the test shots I've taken so far look very promising.Things I'd like to see; a larger buffer so you can keep shooting longer, a dedicated button on the rear of the camera for faster ISO changes, higher ISO up to 3200 even with all the noise, faster autofocus (though real street shooters always use manual prefocus anyway), a better grip, zero shutter lag -- an issue all digital cameras have  and finally support in Lightroom and Photoshop RAW, which I would expect within the next three months or so.Overall, a very good camera, fairly priced for what it is.***Update***  I have now been using the camera for about a month.  I still love it -- but it is really designed as a daylight street-shooter.  I never take it out at night, the noise is too severe, but during the day, the color it produces is JUST GORGEOUS.  Remember the first time you saw Kodachromes??  It's that kind of experience.What could be better about this camera?  First, the buffering needs to be improved.  I can get a shot off every 2 seconds or so, which in a fast moving street scene means you get one chance for the shot.  I wish the powerup was quicker and the lens was a stop faster.  Of course, that would mean a fixed lens (that doesn't retract on poweroff), so the camera wouldn't be quite so portable, but I'd pay that price.  Another issue is the Sigma supplied software to process RAW images, which takes a bit of getting used to.  It's OK, but extremely slow and I'm looking forward to the day when I can use Lightroom, as I mentioned above.One thing that is perfect about this camera is that it is SILENT.  You can make hip-shots all day long without attracting one iota of attention.

The autofocus is simply too slow for a camera at this price, and it is made worse by the fact that the preview image freezes while focus is acquired. These problems combine to make it very difficult to focus and frame the image properly in dynamic situations.Other issues are the rather slow write speed for RAW files...3 seconds, even with a SanDisk Extreme III card and the fact that it takes too many button presses to change the ISO.If we can have dramatically better handling in compact SLRs at the same price-point, why can't the DP1 match that? (I know SLR's use a completely different focusing mechanism, so it may be hard for a compact to completely match their focus speed). But at a minimum, the DP1 should be at the top of the performance charts in every category when compared to other compacts. The fact that it's only average is disappointing.I wanted to love the DP1, but I've returned mine. I think the real problem is Sigma's lack of experience with compacts. Please, Canon, Nikon, someone...take the sensor and image processing pipeline from one of your 1.5x crop compact SLR's and build us the DP1 we really want!", "Date": "April 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great for some, but not for everyone", "Author": "J.

A compact camera with a large sensor similar to a mainstream DSLR rather than the usual tiny sensor found in all other compacts..  Sigma's number one goal was image quality and they sacrificed a lot of other things to get it, so this is not a camera for everyone.On the plus side this is a very well built, metal bodied camera with a high quality lens, DSLR sized sensor and phenomenal image quality in well lit conditions.  Image quality is clearly superior to other compact camera's (puts my Canon G9 to shame at all ISO's and I love low ISO shots from the G9).  Image quality at low to moderate ISO's clearly competes well with any entry to mid level APS-C or 4/3 sized sensor DSLR.On the minus side, performance and handling is more like an economy P&S; compact.  Its no DSLR in these areas, and falls considerably behind something like a Canon G9 in terms of speed and performance.  Things like power up time, focus speed and performance, buffer size, write performance, flash performance is more like an entry level P&S.;While I find its no nonsense utilitarian feature set both desirable and refreshing, it requires a lot of work on the part of the photographer.  No scene modes, face recognition, image stabilization, or much handholding of any kind.  Very few menu options and configurations compared to most camera's today (P&S; or DSLR).  Its reviews are very mixed because of its limited feature set and primitive implementation.If you are into photography as an art, think about most of your pictures before you take them, value image quality over everything else and want a light compact camera, this could be a GREAT camera for you.  Otherwise take heed of all the negative points in all the reviews out there - there are a lot of them and they all seem to agree on both the good and bad points - its just a matter of degree.I was nervous ordering one given the reviews but I was attracted to the DP1's rugged simplicity.  Some of the things I though would bother me (mostly speed related issues) don't - this camera is fast enough for most pictures I take.  Its LCD does not appear to be near as bright or as fine as that on my G9, but its ok indoors and at the golden hours outside.  It offers an optical finder for use in brighter conditions (although at $150 I would have preferred a built in optical finder like the G9).  Its flash is very low powered but they do offer an external flash.  This all adds up to well more than the price of a mid level DSLR, so compact better be important to you.Bottom line: Compact, simple, no frills, high image quality, lots of warts.

I have taken around 1,600 shots with it.The DP1 takes a little getting used to, just like any camera you use from a different manufacturer. This is not a negative.  Once you learn the control system, you'll find it quite fast and intuitive.Changing, ISO, Aperture, Shutter speed, EV, are all very quick and easy.The LCD isn't as bright or as high res as some other cameras but it is quite usable. I took about 300 shots the other day at Niagara Falls in full sunlight and didn't have any major issues with it. I did have theLCD set on high brightness.AF speed: it is a little on the slow side. I believe this is due in part to the DP1's higher focus accuracy. There are several reports of AF accuracy being very good. I would agree.Manual focus is a dream! If you are in MF, when you press the shutter, the shot is taken instantly. With a little practice, you capture those quick moments using MF.Image Quality: Stunning; Ground Breaking; especially considering the size of the camera. ISO800 is very usable.  On most other compact cameras, anything above ISO200 gets very grainy.The terrific IQ is due to two key elements:1.) The superb lens. Sigma has really outdone themselves with the lens. It has terrific sharpness and accuracy. It's quality is on par with professional-quality Digital SLR lenses.2.) The Foveon Direct Image Sensor. [...]On standard (Bayer) sensor cameras, 2/3 of the color data at each pixel site is estimated rather than measured. In the Foveon sensor, each of the pixel sites measures the full true color. There is no guesswork. This results in much sharper images with high dynamic range. Because of the higher quality of the image data, images from the DP1 can be upsized with better quality that standard digital camera output.The final answer:The Sigma DP1 is worth every penny.It's a little quirky in a classic sort of way.It's not perfect but very likable.It is capable of truly stunning imagery. Isn't that what photography is all about?If top image quality is at the top of your requirements then you will be delighted with the Sigma DP1.", "Date": "April 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Three (3) Things You MUST Ask Yourself Before Buying", "Author": "J. Nickel \"Jimmy\"", "ReviewID": "R1IW28PSCV0AWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I love my Sigma DP1 camera. That being said, I also am 100% clear on the reason why other reviewers may hate this camera.So, to help anyone else out there who is trying to sort through the good and bad reviews, let me present the following three questions you should ask yourself before buying.1. What am I shooting mostly?Looking back through my old digital albums, I saw mostly architecture, stills of people, animals, and nature scenes. So, if you are shooting mostly static subjects (i.e., not moving too quickly), you will love this camera.However, if you are shooting a lot of action (kids playing, sports, weddings, events where fast focus is needed) do NOT buy this camera. You will only be disappointed by the lack of speed that every other reviewer compains about.Yes, using infinity or pre-set focus can be a work-around in some cases, but compared to other digital compacts, it's still too sluggish in the moment.2. What do I value more, ease-of-use or image quality?Before buying, I recommend using sites like Flickr or Smugmug to search image results based on cameras. When looking at others' results with the Sigma DP1, my reaction is the same as when looking at my own shots (WOW!).When researching other competing cameras in this category (Canons, Leicas, Nikons) I still saw great pictures but with less of a WOW! factor.The sensor in this camera captures a range of colors, shadows, and highlights like no other. The captured images are very highly nuanced and almost exhibit a film-like result.Of course, if you care less about capturing beautiful images and you need a \"fast-draw\" camera, stay away from the DP1.3. Am I creative?Yes, I'm quite sure there will be some who read this and say, \"I'm creative and I STILL don't like the Sigma DP1!\"I can't overemphasize the use of the term \"Picture Maker\" (as used by one pro photog reviewer). That is, if you have an eye for angles, composition, use of light, and a steady hand, your options for creating rich, stunning images are unlimited (remember, there's no zoom or image stabilization on this thing!).However, if you just want a camera where you just point, shoot, and capture subjects on the fly, then this may be the wrong camera for you.By no means do I mean to denigrate anyone who simply wants a camera that is a \"no-brainer.\" This is a perfectly normal and natural need for a busy person or someone who is using their camera as an image recording device.Of course, if you are a creative individual (who is not offended by the clunkiness of traditional film cameras) this camera may be a great option for you.I hope this helps anyone trying to decide which camera to buy.

The image quality is far superior than any other point & shoot camera, and IMO better than most DLSRs.  I've even seen the DP1 create better photos than a $4500 Canon setup and a $2500 Olympus set up.But even if other companies started putting larger sensors into small bodies, I would still buy another Sigma.  Why?  Because of the Foveon sensor!I was almost discouraged from buying this camera due to many of the negative comments about poor speed and lack of features.  Now I am very happy that I went ahead and bought the Sigma DP1.I understand some customer disastisfaction with the slower in-camera image processing speed, limit of rapid fire shots, and lack of face/smile recognition.  Yes, this camera is lacking some of the modern bells and whistles of the digital camera age.  Rather than a major con, however, I see it as something positive.This camera forces the photographer to slow his itchy trigger finger and be present with the subject.  Being forced to slow down returns the photographer to the simple beauty of photography.  The fine details of the subject and the camera settings become important again.  The removal of \"auto-everything\" features restore the magic of photography and imbue the photos with individual personality.The Foveon sensor is simply amazing.  When compared to every other Bayer-sensored DSLR (Canon, Nikon, etc), the over-saturated cartoonishly fake colors become very apparent.  Foveon sensors capture real color, while Bayer sensors guesstimate colors with mathematics.  In this age of simulated reality (TV shows, Hollywood blockbusters, XBox 360), the DP1 may seem a bit out of place.  But I prefer to capture the natural beauty of our lovely world and not some artificial reconstruction.If you want a simple and authentic camera, then the Sigma DP1 may very well be for you.  I've read a few stories of loyal film photographers finally taking the plunge to digital with the DP1, and being very pleased.However, if you want to shoot 1,000 photos of your son's soccer game and skip the post processing, then go with another brand.

I am amazed at how much detail there is in each photograph, in terms of the color and tonal accuracy and the ability to crop in on very small regions of a photo and still get a decent sharp picture.  The lens and sensor appear to be of very high quality.  I have not found the F4 aperture to be a problem, and find that it produces quite acceptable noise levels at ISO 800. Previously, I was taking photos on a medium format camera, scanning the negatives, then working with Photoshop.  This camera rivals what I can obtain from film, but is much more convenient to use.  I would recommend it for anyone who likes working with high quality images, usually uses a wide angle lens, and appreciates a compact camera rather than a bulkier digital SLR. I would not recommmend it for the casual snapshotter, as this is not a tiny camera, it does not have a zoom lens, the pop-up flash is apparently limited, and there is a few second processing delay after each photo before you can shoot another picture.

The images taken in bright sunlight are truly STUNNING - clear, sharp and with fantastic color. The lens is especially good showing sharpness from edge to edge. The sensor obviously delivers smoothly graduated and vibrant color - the results speak for themselves. However it is not all good. The fixed lens while good is a little too wide for general use IMHO, so it forces some real discipline onto your photos. Maybe a 50mm would have been better. It is a little slow to focus and sometimes just seems to get confused into doing nothing - which is strange. The low light results actually seem quite pedestrian compared to the truly spectacular bright light results. Added to all of this, it seems that the \"non-Bayer\" sensor means that few RAW converters (in my case Apple Aperture)can work with the RAW files it makes - so you need to use the very odd SPP software that comes with the camera. So in summary I will use this when the light is good and the colors work well, and just work around it's limitations. I recommend this as an alternative to an SLR.

Upon opening the box I was impressed with the solid, yet compact, feel of the DP-1. It feels well made and constructed with high quality materials. Fits the hand nicely, though somewhat slippery.The lens is not completely housed within the camera body, so that while it's a compact design this isn't truly a pocket camera, unless you wear cargo pants. This camera really wants to be carried in a pouch, a small waist bag or a purse or backpack.Once you turn it on your greeted by a fairly bright and large LCD, some have complained of loss of detail in bright light. I find that the LCD is about what you'd expect from most cameras, it's utility is degraded in bright light. The Sub-menu structure is somewhat involved, with different options presented depending on the setting the main dial is on. This can make on the fly changes somewhat difficult, and requires that you experiment, practice and set the camera to one major setting (Program, Aperture priority, etc) during a shoot, making small adjustments within it as you go (ISO, focus, etc).This lens really sings, it's got wonderful IQ, the images captured are sharp, brilliant and extremely vivd. I don't miss the ability to zoom, though with this kind of lens it would be nice.Good feedback from all the dials and buttons, though some of them require reviewing the manual to understand their use.Overall findingsPros:Easy to use (with the caveats listed below)Great lens IQGreat, vivid image captureSmall size makes it easy to shoot dailyFull manual control of the photographic processCons:Short battery life, if shooting with LCD and flashF4.0 lens can lead to long exposure times and some difficulty in capturing images in low lightMenu layout is not intuitive and varies with settingsUnable to quickly change essential settings quicklyImage format not yet natively accepted by Aperture, requiring saving multiple file copies.Autofocus can be very slowSlow image write times to cardOverall impression:This is not your typical P&S; camera, nor should it be purchased by amateurs that desire quick P&S; type function.For the serious amateur or professional who wants a small format, excellent digital capture camera the DP-1 can quickly become an important piece of equipment.The images are really beautiful and can easily match those of prosumer DSLRs.This is a great V1 implementation of a larger sensor in a small camera.

Yes, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the other small cameras but for people who are serious about photography, image quality comes first.Would I like it to be faster, have face recognition, better button layout, higher resolution screen, etc? Sure, but I sure wouldn't be willing to sacrifice image quality in order to get it. I know many point & shoot users would.  This is NOT a camera for those folks.This is a thinking person's camera. You have to use your brain to figure out what aperture, speed, ISO, DOF, etc. to get professional photos out of it.  Of course the camera can also help but it's not the quickest in focusing.  Hopefully, future updates to the firmware will address some of the shortcomings.For those of you who want to learn about photography, this is the perfect camera for you also.  It's the perfect camera to learn since it gets you to think about the settings before you take the shot.One other comment I would like to make is on the Foveon sensor. It does have a unique image signature that's very different from the Bayer sensor cameras.  Just as Leicas had a different film signature in the old days with film.  The DP1 has a 3 dimensional accurate color reproduction that's hard to describe.

But.....", "Author": "mr burns", "ReviewID": "R3P6V4XWYDYIN2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My background is in fine art and architectural photography. I use film/digital and have always wanted a high quality yet pocketable digital camera. The reviews on the web were mixed at best - but I felt that there were enough high quality photos taken at iso 200/400 out there to convince me to give it a shot.Key observations:-You MUST shoot with raw files as they are much higher quality then jpg files-You MUST be OK with using JUST the 28mm field of view (I hate zooms!)-You MUST take the time to run the files through the included (but very slow) SPP software AND then spend more time with photoshop-Auto focus is not the best, but perfectly usable in my experience. Manual focus is easy to use outdoors when you know the available depth of field (numbers are floating around the web)-The camera handles very well with an accessory viewfinder - easily fits in your jacket pocket.-ISO 50 is absolutely amazing quality. Also, I feel that you can go up to 400 as color images/prints. I would use 800 only for b+w's because of the noise.-While there are not that many buttons on the back, I have customized it so that both ISO and metering settings can be changed with one button press each.In summary, this is a great little camera for the seasoned photographer. The main drawback is it's relative slowness in terms of AF and file writing. Overall though, the image quality it produces outweigh those weaknesses. I predict that this will reach cult status when discontinued.Hope this helps.ps.

Now that I have been using it for the past month I find it is plenty fast enough for the way I do photography.  I don't get any enjoyment using the 'machine-gun' approach to photography that my fast DSLR provides.  To be honest, I actually prefer using old manual film cameras where I take my time anticipating the shot.  I find this much more rewarding.  The manual focus wheel and the 'feel' of the DP-1 create an almost similar experience as using film.  What can I say about the images this camera produces... Wow! and Wow! again! People say they are the equivilant of entry level DSLRs.  They are not.  They are better.  Much better.  If you feel tempted to delete an image because it doesn't look too good on the lcd screen, resist that temptation.  When you take it home, and work on it very briefly with Sigma Photo Pro, you may be stunned at the quality of the picture that eventually emerges.  It can feel a bit like a diamond emerging from the mud.  I found Sigma Photo Pro a joy to work with, but a bit slow.  It may be my computer, which is getting old now.  I said above that I found the camera plenty fast enough for me, having said that, I found Raw files very slow to write to the card after the shot was taken (about 8 secs).  But I have to remind myself that this is a very small camera and the Raw files are huge (18mb).  If you love the whole \"process\" of photography, as opposed to loving speedy gadgets, this camera could well be your 'cup of tea.'  Allow yourself a lot of time for a learning curve with this camera.  For example, I just discovered today, that the external flash takes much better pictures when the flash is set to ttl and the camera set to 'auto.'  Previously I had been setting the flash to ttl and the camera to 'aperture priority.'  I had been confusing the camera, whereas ttl and auto gave me gorgeous pictures.  If I want to use aperture priority then I have to set the external flash to manual.  This camera is very 'humble' in that it doesn't do itself any favours for a conspicuous marketing ploy.  It's biggest selling point, a DSLR sized sensor and Foveon technology, is not readily seen.  You have to take it on 'faith' that it is in there.  However, when you see the pictures it produces you know that this is not just another high end compact camera. I have had a lot of cameras from film to digital and I can honestly say, with my hand on my heart, that this one is giving me more joy and pleasure than all of them, but one.  My Pentax Spotmatic and Takumar lenses hold that number one place.  However, the fact that the DP-1 produces images the equal of those produced by my film Spotmatic make me wonder how long the Spotmatic will hold it's number one place in my affections.  Finally, I have been surprised at how much controversy this camera produces.  People seem to either love it or hate it.  If you \"need\" speed and rapid responses this camera is not for you. Personally, I had no negative feelings about autofocus speed. Also it is worth knowing that this camera lens has an infinity focus at 8ft, therefore the vast majority of photo opportunities can be taken quite fast when the lens is set manually to infinity.

The bottom line is that the DP1 is so good in some ways and so bad in others that it really depends on how much effort you're willing to put into it.  If you value image quality over ease of use, you may just love the DP1.  If your first thought is \"For that price, it doesn't even have a zoom\" then you obviously want something else.First and foremost, the image quality is very, very good.  Having looked closely at thousands of pictures I've taken with this camera, I'd say there are 3 reasons for this: (1) the larger sensor, (2) the lack of an anti-aliasing filter, (3) a high-quality fixed focal length lens.  The Foveon sensor, produces different (but generally pleasing) color rendition vs. the Bayer sensors in other cameras.  But the startling level of crispness, right out into the corners of the image, when combined with some occasionally annoying moire and color blotches can mean only one thing:  No anti-aliasing filter.  (Examples of removing the AA filter at [...]  It also means one other thing; Sigma's claims that Foveon sensors do not require anti-aliasing are, well, not strictly true and thus the occasional artifact.  (Briefly, \"AA\" filters blur the image slightly to prevent the appearance of moire patterns and color registration errors).OK, back to taking pictures.  For many of the things one would use a small camera for, the DP1 is dismal.  Start up is slow; shutter lag is slow; focusing is slow; flash recycling is slow.  In a word, slow.  You can beat the system to some extent by using manual focus and a fast card but if you want a camera to whip out for that shot of a meteor falling to earth, the DP1 would be less than ideal.  Some will say the manual focus is genius.  I suspect Sigma realized they had to do something until they can buy or license better focusing technology.The LCD is not great.  The displays are not great.  I put my Voigtlander finder into the shoe and the black paint rubbed off.  I've used Sigma lenses on and off since they had the YS system, so none of the above really surprised me.  But what did catch me off guard was the quality of the lens.  From the very first shot, I could see I was getting more sharpness and detail than with any point and shoot I had used, including Canon G series and the wonderful Ricoh GR Digital.  I also discovered, by frame 6, that there would sometimes be color blotches and a bit of moire.So that's it.  I took it through Asia and on days when my shoulders could no longer stand my SLRs, I took the DP1, knowing that I wouldn't have a \"great opportunity - wish I had my SLR\" situation.I hope this is helpful.

It has no optical zoom. Much has been written about the quality of its images and it is well-deserved; the images are amazingly beautiful. The colors seem \"cleaner,\" less muted. Interestingly though, Sigma has skimped on everything except image quality, like not having a built-in lens cover, image-stabilization, a viewfinder, a spring loaded battery cover, or a strong flash. Or generating a jpeg simultaneously along with RAW files. (Jpeg's are standard, but when set to RAW there is no jpeg generated, which means you can view it on the camera's LCD but not on the computer, unless you create a jpeg by processing it through their Sigma Photo Pro program.) The Sigma DP1 is a very compact camera about the same size as the Panasonic LX3, and weight and bulk of the Canon G9, but with an SLR-sized (APS-C) Foveon sensor. It comes with an excellent manual and once you turn off the beeping for focus confirmation and button click (which I tend to do), it operates silently except for the mechanical groan it emits when extending or retracting its lens on power-on and power-down.  It handles easily on a wrist strap. Its 230,000 pixel LCD is adequate for a 2.5\" display and doesn't seem unusually coarse or dim. Auto-focusing is deliberate and slow. As a work-around, you can speed things up by setting the camera to manual focus and either zone-focus for a distance or infinity. Auto-exposure is also slow, taking a second or two to settle on the exposure. Since the camera has no image stabilization (a big draw-back in my opinion, and fairly common amongst point-and-shoots costing less than half the price) forget about photographing indoors without flash, unless of course you use a tripod. The power button placement is awkward. The LCD can easily be scratched. Noise (graininess) is evident in darker tones beyond ISO 200. In low light the display becomes grayscale even though the final image is normal. But if you can tolerate all that the results are worth it.  Letter size prints looked awesome but the real test was seeing how they would print on 13\" wide paper on my Epson 2200. Increasing image size in Photoshop (bicubic for smoother) from 2640 x 1760 pixels to 3240 x 2160 pixels (for 12x18\") while maintaining resolution at 180 ppi (pixels-per-inch) yielded impressive results. To my eye the Sigma DP1 RAW files produces sharper prints than anything from a Canon G9 or Panasonic LX2.  If close-up photography is your thing the Hood Adapter HA-11 is mandatory because there are no filter screw treads on the lens.  The updated Sigma Photo Pro v3.2 software for processing RAW files has a powerful new interface which makes it very user-friendly. The Firmware update 2.0 (released late 2008) adds a bit more customizable functionality to the LCD display and buttons.  This camera might be too limiting for the beginner, but if your photography is one of reflection and observation rather than quick reaction, you will find the Sigma DP1 a noteworthy asset in your arsenal of image-making tools.", "Date": "May 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "A digiatl Leica M that can do AF.

I suppose I'm an amateur photographer, but one with a large amount of experience using DSLRs. I always get frustrated with compact digital cameras since they usually have little creative/manual controls...then I heard about the DP1 from a friend of my brother's, did some research...The quality of the DP1 is amazing for how small the camera is. It's the main reason I chose this camera over the Panasonic LX3. Well...and it was about $200 cheaper than the Panasonic at the time I bought it ($450 is a steal for this camera!). The design of the camera really appealed to me as well. The DP1 makes you work a little more for a good photo. That's what I wanted - not a feature-packed camera with an exceptional auto mode. The auto mode on the DP1 is alright, but I almost never use it because you can't manually focus in that mode. As long as you don't expect this camera to perform like a DSLR, you'll be alright. The flash is weak, ISO above 200/400 is usually too grainy (mostly in low-light), and card write times are relatively slow. The videos from the DP1 have a great look to them, but the resolution is too small for any use other than making video for Internet upload. But hey, it's a digital camera, so the quality of the video mode doesn't really matter to me.If you want a more consumer-friendly camera, buy the Nikon P6000 or Canon G10. If you want HD video and to pay more, get the Panasonic LX3. Or, if you want the BEST quality photos and to learn a little bit about photography, get the DP1 like I did.A few random tips:-I got the Mountainsmith Cyber II M case at REI, it fits the DP1 perfectly with a spare battery and memory card, and is a rugged case for all of my outdoor adventures-Check out Lensmate for customizing the DP1, I got the grip from their website and I love it-Figure out if you want to shoot RAW or JPEG, a 4 GB card holds about 1,100-1,200 high quality JPEGS, while only holding 250 RAW files (I'm getting into RAW and wish I had bought a larger card initially, oh well!)-The software that comes with the DP1 is definitely average, so look around if you want better options for converting and editing RAW images.

My other cameras have all taken good pictures, but they haven't captured what I remember.  No amount of money will get it back for me.I'm not sure I agree with the reviews that say this camera is not for everyone.  Yes, it doesn't have bells and whistles and it doesn't try to make things easy.  But I bet someone who knows nothing about cameras would take better photos with this camera at its factory setting than they would with a \"smart\" point and shoot.  Just my opinion, of course.  The fixed wide angle lens would be the most aggravating part.  As it is for me.  But again, everything you see in the LCD comes out exactly as you'll remember it.  So if you frame whatever you want (which might mean getting up in your subject's face) the camera will take care of the rest.  The reason the camera doesn't have zoom is simple.

I often decide to sell it, especially after I take it out for some simple pics at a party. It's not even close to Canon, Sony, etc., in ease of use. It can mess up on a photo a $50 point and shoot could handle with ease.  But then it takes some pictures that just jump out of the screen, or off the paper.

It loves iso 100 in bright daylight.  The colors are dreamy.  Even sunset at iso 100 f4 will give the most beautiful colors.  Leave the white balance on sun and no problems.  Part sun and some shade looks dramatic, but all shade looks washed out even with WB on shade.  Most reviewers say autofocus is slow, so I never have tried it!  Manual focus is great, just rotate the wheel to fast focus and you can zoom in to see detail while focusing by hitting the screen button on the lower right hand corner.  Mainly for most landscape shots or even most spontaneous shots, you can reduce the aperture and leave the focus on infinity with a wide open depth of field ensuring proper focus.  You can set the exposure bracketing to get three shots in one sec. Thus with preset focus and three rapid shots you can even get some great spontaneous shots. Use the LCD screen just to frame the picture: it will looked washed out in bright sun, and resist the temptation of all digit cameras to review the shot after you've taken it...  like a film cameras you wont know what you are getting till you \"process\" the picture.  Use the sigma pro software supplied which does an amazing job, if slightly slow at bringing out the image either on the default setting or auto.  You can make a few custom changes as well to bring out amazing images.  One tip is to use a SD card reader and the fastest SD card you can get and to review the unprocessed images rather more quickly as thumbnails and the only process the shots you like, since thats what take considerably more time.  There is an easy wheel on top to select aperture priority, and easy buttons to switch between apertures quickly.  Used in this way, you really won't be using many of the menu items which have been described as cumbersome for anything other than setting up the camera, which is best done with the manual by your side.  Set operation and shutter to silent and the camera is completely silent while shooting!  Sure it's a little noisy when the lens extends or retracts, but if you simply leave it on, no problem.  In short. the beauty of this camera is amazing sunlight pictures, light very portable well built body and a lovely quality wide angle sigma lens.

It helps of course that the image quality is of such a high standard so there's great satisfaction to be had with the fruits of your labour. I reckon the DP-1 should be used by photography students in place of high-speed DSLRs purely so they get into the habit of not being happy with wasted shots. Of course this camera isn't for sports photography, nor is it a little point and shoot to use to capture sudden events, but if you have the time, patience and really want to make this camera work for you, the results can be breathtaking. I took this along to a wedding and captured a priceless image of the bride and all her entourage looking, mouth agape, to see who'd caught the bouquet.

The flash should be removed, it is simply dumb and has a guide number of about -10 (kidding of course). The lens is nice but needs to be a full stop faster at least. A 2.0 lens alone would cause this thing to evaporate off of store shelves. The accessories are bizarrely overpriced, especially the case (majorly ugly and junky) and the VF-11 Viewfinder (junky, small, and many people are going to the Voigtlander model anyway or buying ancient ones off of ebay..Sigma is really screwing up badly by pricing this thing so high, the markup must be 800%). The LCD screen is too dark and the batteries take a month to charge. This camera is incredibly slow when shooting in raw mode...you better be patient and if you are working with someone you will often times be heard to say: \"excuse me the camera is still writing the image to the card\"..or something to that effect. The DP-1 has a grid over lay on the screen but an absolute MUST for this camera is a bubble balancer..either for the hot shoe or if u can somehow manage to find a 25mm long mini balance you can glue it onto the top of the flash (trust me). This camera is mostly made out of metal and feels relatively solid. The lens design is kinda dumb also..I would much prefer a fixed lens instead of a battery eating lens extension every time I start the camera. There is a new model being worked on that will address some of these issues, so let's keep our fingers crossed, but don't hold off on buying a DP-1 now..the way Sigma works it could be decades until the new one is released. What this camera really needs is to have a Leica M-Mount, and real rangefinder viewing would really be a dream come true. Of the models available (DP-1, DP-1s, DP-2) I recommend the original DP-1, the images are quite remarkable, nudes shot with this thing under blue skies yields awesome skin tones, skies, and detail. The small size of the camera is a big plus, not quite pocket-able, but close! Sigma could also get off of their butts and create a full-frame foveon chip....there are sooo many things they could do.

It's just a question of what priorities you have and what you want in a camera.  If you're looking for the best all-around compact you can get, and are satisfied with perfectly decent image quality, maybe you'd be better off with something like the Canon G10 or Panasonic LX3, excellent cameras by all accounts.  On the other hand, if you want a compact camera that has, hands down, the best picture quality of any compact digicam on the market today, and you are willing to put up with a slow, quirky, limited camera to get it, welcome to the Sigma DP1.A lot has been written about this camera, both in these Amazon reviews, and elsewhere.  Since there is no shortage of information, I am going to limit my comments to two areas.  First, some specifics regarding image quality, followed by a couple of clarifications regarding things that people have said in other reviews on this page.Other than being cool looking (to my eye), and very solidly built, this camera is basically a one trick pony, and its trick is unsurpassed image quality.  So even the most minor image quality flaws bear mentioning.  Keep in mind, the pictures from this camera are outstanding, and I am doing everything I can to nitpick here.1.  Color noise, especially at high ISO in dark areas, takes the form of green and magenta mottling.  It is much less finely grained than color noise usually is, and as such, is not entirely removed by the normally very effective \"color noise reduction\" slider in Lightroom.2.  White balance sometimes tends towards magenta in the highlights, and green in shadow areas, making a global white balance correction difficult in some cases.3.  Color saturation is greatly reduced at high ISO.4.  Chromatic abberation, though slight and easily corrected in Lightroom, seems more pronounced in many of my photos than it had been in sample photos that I'd looked at before purchase.Again, I'm really looking for flaws here.  Sharpness and dynamic range are incredible.  Color and noise levels are amazing.  The picture quality of this camera bests not only any other compact, but indeed many lower end DSLRs as well.Lastly, a few comments regarding some things said in other reviews on this page.1.  The latest DP1 firmware (1.04 as of this writing) includes a number of improvements, including the ability to map the ISO controls to the otherwise useless \"zoom\" buttons on the camera.  This means that ISO can now be changed directly with a single button push, without going into any menu.  (My camera, ordered a couple weeks ago from Amazon, did not come with the latest firmware, but it is easy to download and install from Sigma's website.)2.  As of this writing, Adobe Camera Raw, DNG Converter, and Lightroom 2.1 now offer \"preliminary\" support for DP1 raw files.  I have been using Lightroom 2.1, and to be honest, it does not render the DP1 raw files as well as Sigma's own software.  But it is adequate in most cases, and it is reasonable to expect that this will improve once the support is no longer just \"preliminary.\"3.  Some reviewers have mentioned that the camera is not really 14 megapixels, one reviewer going so far as to suggest that the claim is misleading, \"since each pixel records only one color.\"  By that logic, the megapixel claims of all manufacturers are spurious, since the same is true of every camera on the market.  If you're interested in this camera, you probably already know what the Foveon X3 sensor is, and understand issues of color interpolation vs. spacial interpolation, and photo sensors vs. final image pixels.  But if you're interested in reading more about this, Mike Chaney gives the best explanation I've encountered.  (Amazon apparently won't let me give a link here, you can do a Google search for \"Chaney\" and \"sd14\" and click the first result.)  Mr. Chaney is talking about the Sigma SD14, but the SD14 and the DP1 use the same image sensor, and all of his comments are applicable to the DP1 as well.All in all, I am very happy with this camera, and I hope it is a sign of things to come.  It is not perfect, but it's a step in the right direction, and it would be great to see Sigma, and other manufactures, continue down this road of making compact cameras for serious photographers.", "Date": "October 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sigma DP-1camera review", "Author": "W.

Otherwise, I'm very pleased. About two years ago I was looking at getting a really good compact digital camera, and my choice finally came down to the Sigma DP1 vs. the Panasonic DMC LX3. I chose the Panasonic and I still think, or rather know now, that that was the right choice. I can now directly compare the two cameras. My choice was, in the end, based on a comparison of lenses, and the Panasonic has a Leica/Zeiss lens that is a beauty. Plus, the Panasonic has more options and based on what I read at the time performs better in low light. I'm not so sure about that. That's the major drawback to not purchasing a DSLR system. Well, that and not being able to switch out lenses on the compacts. The Panasonic also offers f2.8, while the Sigma offers only f4, though the Sigma lens will close to f11, while the Panasonic only to f8. The Sigma lens is wider angle too. But the Panasonic allows for an optional REALLY wide-angle attachment that works well, though it's a pricey little thing. The Panasonic is also slightly smaller (more compact) than the Sigma and it consists of a metal case while the Sigma consist of plastic, albeit a fairly good plastic. (The best plastic-like material can be found in Minox sub-compacts.)Now, while the Panasonic has a Leica lens, the Sigma has Foveon metering, which is why I wanted it so badly. So the Sigma can produce DSLR-level photos. I really love it, including--sometimes--it's greater simplicity. The Panasonic has countless menus within menus, not that they aren't most all useful at one time or another. But I use both cameras only in Manual mode. That mode, and RAW format, are available on both cameras and tools aren't so different from one another. The cameras are about equal, at least in Manual mode, while I don't much care about the other modes. I can't even understand why one would ever need Shutter Priority. Aperture Priority makes a little more sense, but not much when there's a manual mode. Program Mode is just fully auto with a few more options than fully Automatic Mode. And any prospective purchasers should bear in mind that options in both cameras are more limited when shooting RAW format; i.e., digital zoom isn't possible, etc., etc. But digital zoom results in photos so degraded there could only be technical or desperate reasons for ever using it. These are wide-format cameras and that's just the way it is. Except, I should mention, the Panasonic does have a wonderful macro option that the Sigma lacks entirely. I think the Sigma allows for more megapixels, but past a certain point that becomes irrelevant. Both cameras produce adequate images in that regard.Both cameras offer similar metering modes and auto-focusing modes, whether set to more or less auto or to manual. I get a kick out of the Sigma's old-style manual focus, which uses an actual dial-in focusing tool complete with a guide that pops up on the screen. The Panasonic manual focus is more awkward, though it does nicely display depth of field.The choice of cameras was tough back then and I hated--for financial reasons--having to make a choice between the two cameras. Now I have both, thanks to a very good deal on the Sigma, as models of both cameras are out of date already. (As I said in another review, I seriously doubt that current models take better pictures, though no doubt they offer ever more and more options, gimmicks, thingamajigs, and so on.)The Sigma came with a lens hood and in a very nice leather half-case with strap. I had to buy one for the Panasonic, and they are expensive, believe me!! $100+ for each case. That's almost as much as for viewfinders that attach or for optional flash units available for both cameras (and essential if one does a lot of flash photography). The case for my Panasonic is a full-cover one I had to order from Japan. These cases offer a lot of protection while allowing access to all camera controls.The only really, really awkward thing about using these cameras is how difficult it is to use filters--thanks to the pop-out lenses. I DO wish manufacturers would figure out a way to make filters that fit the smallest diameter lens extension. I realize that could be very hard to do, but I think it could be done with a bit of ingenuity in design. As matters stand, use of filters requires long tubes that allow the lenses to move back and forth depending--in the case of the Panasonic--on the optical zoom chosen; and--in the case of the Sigma, which lacks optical zoom--on the simple fact that the lens extends from the camera body on start-up. That is, for those who don't already know, attaching a filter directly over the lens would cause the camera to issue a message asking that the lens cap be removed first. Filters have to be fitted at the end of the tubes, which in turn have first to be attached to the camera. The Sigma still allows, however, for use of the lens hood with a filter in place, while I have none for the Panasonic. I should get one but don't know how it would attach to the tube with a filter in place. So that's my biggest gripe about both of these cameras and, I think, likely about all so-called \"point and shoot\" cameras when on starting one up the lens extends out from the camera body. That's nice for carrying them, but very awkward for use of filters and hoods.I'm very happy with both of my fixed-lens, compact (far more than \"point and shoot\") cameras, and really happy to have both to play with.

Focus in normal light was reasonably prompt and accurate.  Loading of taken images is slow by DSLR standards, but not a problem shooting most landscapes (my interest).  The lens is very good--sharp to the edges, very little CA (chromatic aberration) and very little distortion of vertical and horizontal lines right out to the margin of the image frame.  You'd think there wouldn't be some issue with what happens to the light between the back of the lens and the signals recorded by the 3-layer Foveon sensor--but something is going wrong.Even with an upgrade to the current 2.00 Sigma DP1 firmware and the current SPP 3.2 software for a Mac computer, the glaring greenish shift persists at the corners and even side margins of all images shot in all circumstances in daylight, overcast, indoors, outdoors, any F-stop, as JPG's, as RAW files, etc.  On a Sigma forum discussion, it was suggested that the Microsoft version of Sigma's current development software corrects for this color shift.  If so, from my experience, the Mac version does not.Great idea and great little lens (dispite a little light fall-off even at F6.3), even great color, resolution and dynamic highlight range.

Here are some highlights1. I may not be a professional but I'm definitely NOT a photography newbie, I have couple canon and Sony DSLRs and couple Sony and eight L lenses in my bag and been shooting for years, and yes I do know how to play around with shutter speed, aperture, iso....2. my first feeling of this Sigma Dp1 is it's so light, and cheap build plastic quality on my hand.3. extremely noise LCD, I turned it on in a room with big windows and lots of sun light, but the LCD showed noise like hell. It's a very low resolution LCD.4. slow autofocus.5. extremely slow processing speed after taking a photo, looks like it froze for 5-6 seconds and you can't even do anything with the camera until the camera \"wakes up\". The red light is on indicating that it's \"processing\". I can't accept this kind of speed, specially for a point and shoot (DSLR alike). Probably with a sandisk extreme SD, it would be better, but...not worth it.6. Very slow resolution, even though it has 14MP, but I do not understand why resolution is extremely low, in photoshop it's showing me the photo is 2500 something by 1000 something. This is unacceptable for a 14MP, I felt like Sigma is lying to me.

This is progress?This camera does a few things exceptionally well, which will suit a few people well. But for most of the things people buy a camera for, this one does mediocrely, at best.It may be the slowest camera on the market at almost everything--so no quick shots of the kids playing, the dog fetching, or a sports team doing anything but stand there.The 14MP sensor is a somewhat specious claim. Each pixel records only one color, so the actual image size is only 4.46MP--smaller than almost any other camera out there. (In bright light, those will be 4.46 very good MP's. But its performance in low light is not outstanding.) This is an adequate file size for a 11x14 print, if you don't need to crop. But given the lens, you probably will need to crop--a lot.Insta-Matics had wide-angle lenses mainly because they put everything in focus. But they also distort perspective badly, which creates problems for most shots. The shot of your family opening Christmas presents will show little, tiny people in an immense, cavernous living room. That nice snapshot of your family standing in front of the Eiffel Tower will turn out to be a scary shot of the Eiffel Tower looming over your little, tiny family. To get the picture you wanted of your family, you'll have to crop the shot, which will be too small a file to get a good enlargement. Eight-hundred dollars is a lot to spend for 4x6 snaps.To get a portrait of your mom, you'll have to shove the camera in her face, which she probably won't like. She'll like the picture you get even less, because she'll look like a squirrel--pointy nosed and round-cheeked. By exaggerating perspective, a wide angle lens not only makes spaces look deeper than they are, they also exaggerate facial features--which is why portrait photographers use telephoto lenses. Pointy noses and apple cheeks for everyone.So if this camera does EXACTLY what you need, go for it. For the same money, however, you can get a much more versatile DSLR, which will do more things better than this, even if it'll be larger and more complicated to use. If you need RAW output, a Canon G9 will do most things better than this at half the cost.
