Rosener \"Photomatic\"", "ReviewID": "R2C53RYHCUYWPR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, let me tell you that this lens only works fully with the latest Nikon SLRs because it has no aperture ring to set f/stops. You must do that electronically using a D100, D2H, D70, N80, N75, F5 or F100. However, Nikon does provide a nice compatibility chart telling you how to use this lens on older Nikon cameras. So you can use this lens on S and P modes with the N90s, N8008s, N 6000, and N4004. This backward compatibility of lenses and bodies is one of the strongest points of the Nikon system. Even a 24 year old lens can be used with a new Digital SLR, to some extent.The lens is very light for it's zoom range. It has a reasonably substantial feel, unlike some of the Sigma lenses I've used. It's made of polycarbonate, which is the same stuff the F117 Stealth fighter is made from.If you shoot lots of portraits, this is the lens to get. The telephoto allows you to throw the background out of focus with relative ease. The lens has a 9 bladed iris, so out of focus elements are rendered in very subtle and beautiful forms. The Japanese call this \"Bokeh\" and much has been written about it. It's very nice that the Nikon engineers took this aesthetic principal into account when designing this economy lens. Once again, Nikon proves to be a design driven company.The zoom ring has a nice feel with good manual dampening. Zooming is precise with no \"slop\" or wobble. Manual focus is about average for a lens of this caliber. It's possible, but no great joy. Since I'm used to the silky feel of Nikon's old AIS  lenses, I doubt anything could rate higher. Autofocus for this lens is much better, and seems to be quick and precise. About the only time it balked was when shooting delicate cloudscapes. This is common for AF lenses and simply requires you to quickly disengage the AF on your camera body and rack the lens to \"Infinity\" setting.My D70 DSLR made this lens handy to grip and insanely light. The great thing about using this lens on a DSLR is that you end up with a 450mm zoom lens! great for bringing in distant objects. Watch out when shooting against strong backlight, however. This lens seemed to have more than a little \"Purple fringing\". Shots done in normal lighting conditions exhibit zero fringing, and superb sharpeness. So that's the good news.Overall this lens is a great bargain and worthy of the Nikkor name. Don't let the low price fool you. Although it's not a Nikkor 80-200 f/2.8 by any means, this lens is highly capable and a great second lens for your D70 Digital SLR or N series 35mm SLR. Nikon USA offers a 5 year warranty FREE if you mail the registration postcard in within 10 days of purchase. So be sure to get that in the mailbox right after buying!", "Date": "September 6, 2004"}, {"Title": "Good lens for this price", "Author": "Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"", "ReviewID": "R18KOO1GUMNCLY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Weighing in at about 15 oz., this Nikkor AF zoom lens is a lot of bang for the buck.  The zoom range is 70-300mm; if you use a Nikon digital SLR like my D70, the effective range is 106-456mm due to the 1.5x crop factor.  300mm or 450mm, this is a very powerful zoom lens for relatively little money.The maximum aperture of the lens is f4 at 70mm and one stop slower at f5.6 at 300mm.  These are of course slower than more expensive Nikkor's which can go to f2.8, but for that you'd be shelling out many times more money.  For most outdoor daylight photos as well as well-lit portraits, this lens does the job.  At f5.6 and 300mm, you'll get a nice shallow depth of field that will give you that \"professional\" portrait you've been looking for.  Just make sure you use a tripod.This Nikkor sports excellent optics (despite not being an ED -- see below), and is a full auto-focus lens when mounted on Nikon SLRs that can do AF on G-type lenses.  To switch into manual focus on one of these cameras, be sure to set the focus switch on the camera body to M (manual) first, before engaging the focus ring.  Because this is *not* an AF-S (S for silence) lens, it does not have the \"ultrasonic\" built-in motor and is completely driven by the camera, that's why you want to set the focus mode switch on the camera to M before turning the focus ring.Because this is not an AF-S lens, it's noisy when hunting for focus.  Being an economics lens, it focuses pretty fast when there's plenty of light, but in low light situations, it can \"hunt\" for focus for a long time.  In fact, where there's little light, you'll need to half-press the shutter button several times before the lens autofocuses properly; and don't be surprised if you have to switch to manual focus.  (Just remember to set the camera's focus mode to M!)Other features missing from this low-priced lens are a macro mode and low-dispersion (called ED by Nikon).  Of course, it doesn't have vibration reduction, either.Oh, if you have a digital SLR, you'll get an additional benefit of using a non-DX lens on a d-SLR: because only the central part of the image from the lens actually hits the sensor, you won't have to worry about aberrations that affect the edges, esp. when using low-cost lenses.  From corner to corner, side to side, your picture will be sharp.In short, for a little over $100 you are getting a genuine Nikon-designed (but made in China) lens with excellent optics, a long zoom range, fast autofocusing in bright light, and relative light weight but solid construction.  On the other hand, the low, low price means you won't get macro, ED, ultrasonic focusing mechanism, or the very best optics that much more expensive Nikkor lenses have.If you have enough money, I recommend getting a high-quality zoom lens that covers the wideangle to telephoto focal lengths.  My favorite is the compact and lightweight Tamron 28-300mm Di XR LD lens sold here on Amazon (although you do give up aperture speed).", "Date": "January 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very nice zoom lens, not for low light or dark indoor though", "Author": "Sidarta Tanu", "ReviewID": "R28N22TQIZYMFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I'm giving this 70-300mm lens a 5 stars rating partly because the price is inexpensive (which is good in my opinion).

I have taken some unbelievable photos with this camera, ranging from animals to motocross.  Many of the photos look like they are magazine quality.  If you aren't used to a pro-quality lens (which I am not), you'll think this lens is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  In my amateur opinon, it seems to focus quickly (of course that depends on whether the item is close-up, lighting etc; can range from instant to a couple of seconds ... if you are trying to capture a fast-moving object, I DO recommend that you already have the focus in the approximate focus range, and then the lens will focus in about a 1/10th of a second).  So don't take a picture of a flower that is 5 feet away, and expect to instantly snap a picture of an Indy car flying by 50 feet away at 200MPH ... be ready for the Indy car, focus on the track before the car comes by, and you'll probably get an awesome shot!I'm not saying that every single shot turns out great - when zoomed to the max (especially if the conditions are cloudy or dark), a good number of my action shots were somewhat blurry.  Since I have the new Nikon D50 (digital SLR), if I snap 5 pictures and 3 of them are blurry I can instantly delete them (or delete them when I get home).  But if I had a film camera, I might not be quite as happy if I had to pay for developing some blurry pictures.The actual zoom level is very good - I don't know the exact magnification level, but it is as much as you could want if you don't have the camera mounted on a tripod.  The construction seems very sturdy and \"professional\" looking - included is a nice \"hood\" that goes over the end of the lens, and makes you feel like a pro!If you are professional wildlife photographer, and are seeking out the perfect photo of the extremely rare and endangered African-duckbilled-yellow-breasted-warbler, then pay $1,000 for a true pro-quality lens that can stabilize images, etc.  But if you are a weekend-warrior photographer who wants to be able to capture some pro-quality shots (but your income doesn't depend on it) at a fraction of the price, then this is THE lens for your Nikon camera.", "Date": "August 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "300mm at an affordable price", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "R1K7HMTETIEU69", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The 70-300 G is definitely one of the least expensive lenses to get you to 300 mm, but there are some tradeoffs with the low price tag.

At the beach shooting surfers I came up a bit short.  Photographing birds I came up short.  Even photographing sunsets was a bit wimpy.  So I knew I needed just a bit more \"firepower.\"So I did some research, including Amazon, and thought I'd give the 70-300G a try.  I bought it from a local dealer in case I needed to return it.  The first day was rainy, so the lens was shooting at f/4-5.6 and I wasn't impressed.  But the next day I headed out to a local bird santuary, and wow!  The extra power of a 300 makes a bit difference.The reviews here are right on.  If you need a low light lens, this isn't it.  But if you're willing to live with a setting of f11 for the 300mm setting, the quality is superb.  To be honest Nikon probably shouldn't even call this an f4-5.6, but a f5.6-f8 lens, and the settings shouldn't allow any larger openings (I usually set my camera in aperature priroty at f11 when I put the lens on).  It is also very slow to focus in low light situations, if at all (the worst I've found is fireworks); in those cases I usually focus manually.For me, a 300mm lens is a drastic improvement over a 200mm.  If you find yourself usually shooting in daylight, this lens will do it for you.  You'll be impressed by the power.  Like another reviewer said, everyone with a D50 or D70 should own one.  In fact I would recommend it over the 55-200mm.  If you need to shoot in low light situations and you need the whole 300mm, you'll need to spend a lot more.UPDATE: I've been using the lens for a couple of years now, and am generally still happy with it.  I am still sold on the extra power.  However, the lens was never as crisp as I would like.  I don't know if I got a lemon, or the lens is nust naturally a bit soft.  Since that time I have upgraded to the 18-200 which I keep on the camera ALL the time (no dust).  I have found the 18-200 to be crisp.

The auto focus is pretty fast even at low light unlike some of the comments I saw. The auto focus Nikon body has a male drive pin that engages to the female pin on the lens ring and the focus locks it plenty fast for most applications. You need to make sure that you engage the auto focus switch next to the lens lock button on front of the D90 body. Switch it off for manual focus otherwise you will not be able to move the focus ring. Being able to use this motor-less lens was one of the main reasons why I purchased the D90 because it just saved me $500-%600 getting this lens. I am sure a $700 lens will be faster but since I don't use this lens much it suits my need quite well. Just took a photos of a duck zoomed in all the way and compared it with my $350 18-105 Nikor zoom, the difference is day and night due to the optical zoom of course. Now, I can take photos of birds. Can't see any reason to spend $700 for a dozen photos a year which is what my usage rate is. The lens has no VR so I braced myself and took a photo of a duck and the result is stunning. I compared the same photo with a friend's with the 18-200 and I must say the result is better on the 70-300mm since it is really a 450mm optical zoom. Not really a fair comparison since it is twice the zoom but now I can clearly see no reason to get the 18-200. My 18-105 with the 70-300 give me the complete range coverage I need. I don't make a living with photography and I can't really tell the difference between photos taken with this lens and a $700 lens unless I put them side by side. If there is a difference, you would have to use a magnifying glass I am sure. The photos are just great already. I would not buy this lens if I have a D40 because it will not work with auto focus. There is a Sigma lens for $50 more if you have the D40, not sure the result you will get with that lens. I have an old Sigma lens which is just horrible but this was purchased 15 years ago, I think a lot has changed since. If you have the D90 or any focus motor body Nikon camera and want to save big money, you will be very pleased that you get this one.Update: after comparing with other lens, this lens is not sharp enough.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great lens for the price", "Author": "Ryan Karolak", "ReviewID": "R15BXRUGYSQ7G8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Quite often people dismiss cheap lenses (under $200). While there are certainly bad lenses in this price range, there are often lenses that are surprisingly good. Many of these are Nikon's cheaper consumer lenses.I bought this lens for use on my Nikon D700 and D40 until I get around to buy a nicer telephoto, which would cost significantly more. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but I have been pleasantly surprised with the quality of the pictures for the price. The sharpness and colors are significantly better than another Cheap lens at 70-210mm (can't remember the brand, it was an off-brand).There are a few drawbacks to this lens, of course. This lens does auto-focus on cameras with AF and G capability, but must be manually focused on cameras that do not. This includes some other 35mm SLRs as well as Nikon's newer consumer SLRs that don't contain a focusing motor. These cameras would include the D40, D40x, D60, D3000, D3100, and D5000. I own a D40 and can use this lens on it, but have to focus manually. You also can't adjust the aperture on old manual-focus cameras.There is also no image stabilization, therefore to take consistent sharp images in low light you need to use a fast shutter speed, which may not always be easy to do. This isn't the fastest lens either, starting at f/4 at 70mm and f/5.6 at 300mm. Because of both of these omissions this lens works best in good light unless you have a camera that performs well at higher-ISO settings or you have a flash that can compensate.I've also noticed that the autofocus is a bit slow, as well as loud. It's not as bad when the focus adjustments are small however, making it usually fine for tracking moving subjects, it just becomes inconvenient if for example you are tracking a soccer player and at some point accidently focus on the background and have to go back.The final drawback I noticed is there seems to be a little bit of distortion and softness as you reach 300, but it's acceptable considering the price of this lens.Overall this is a great deal. There are some conveniences and frills that are left out, as mentioned above, but considering this is only $130 I feel you can't go wrong. If you don't have a telephoto for your Nikon and considering this because you don't want to spend $500+, buy this. It's worlds better than nothing. Just keep in mind that the autofocus will not work if you have a D40/40x/60/3000/3100/5000.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Lens", "Author": "R.

Although it is of fairly sophisticated and complex design, none of its THIRTEEN multi-coated elements are ED glass, and therefore no 'shiny gold on black' badge anywhere in evidence; just flat, matte' light gray print, instead. In fact, it is one of the least flashy products ever to wear the Nikon name! And while it has a focus distance scale, it has NO focus point mark or DOF scales; it's symmetry is not even broken by an auto/manual focus switch on the side! When the variator (zoom control) is turned, the front element does not rotate...however, when the lens is focused, the front element DOES turn!Color and clarity are frankly amazing and it's quite sharp throughout its range; surprisingly so for it's $150 price. In fact, it's almost as sharp as the present day AF-S 70-300 VR. ALMOST, but not quite, and then only on a DX body, but it's bokeh is actually better! And unlike the $600 AF-S 70-300mm VR, it doesn't rattle when you shake it!It has no VR mechanism and as I mentioned, no internal focus motor, but then, it's pretty light weight and quite well balanced on a D90 body, so it is very easy to hand-hold at lower shutter speeds. It may not get many covetous stares from other shooters...but it probably won't attract any of the 'wrong kind of attention', either. To be perfectly honest, with its lens shade attached, it doesn't look at all out-of-place on a D80, D90, or a D7000, but it just might on a D3.In the right hands, this lens will produce simply stunning images; sharp and clear with very good color and contrast...but you have to know what you're doing. I dare say that the 'point and shoot' crowd would be very disappointed, but 'Gray Barrel Nikkor Lens' aficionados will probably be more than a little bit irritated to learn this lens costs only $150!I call this lens \"The Thing\"...because I like it better than no thing...about A MILLION TIMES better than no thing!The Thing...get it now?Did I mention it's also half a 'stop' FASTER at the wide end of the zoom than the $600 VR lens!!

This is a very light lens, with no VR, so when zoomed in you'll notice quite a bit of camera shake.  This is easily solved by either using a monopod, tripod or some other type of stabization if you want to get sharper pictures.The lens does indeed get softer in the 200-300mm range, but a little sharpening in PS usually does the trick.  Since the maximum aperture is f/4, don't expect your subjects to pop much from the lack of bokeh.  Then again, I didn't expect much bokeh in a $140 lens, so this wasn't a surprise to me.I know this review sounds more like a two star review, but keep in mind that you're getting a 300mm telephoto lens for less than $150.

This is cheapest way to get to 300mm. *It won't autofocus on the low end Nikon DSLR's, though.* If the user guide of your low end Nikon DSLR is telling you about lens compatibility issues, you can assume that this one won't work, either.So, is it worth it? If you can't autofocus, no, it's not worth it. The f/5.6 aperture means that when you look through the lens, it's gonna be dark. Even if you're willing to manually focus the thing, the view through the viewfinder is too dark to see clearly, so focusing is going to be hard.Now, what if you have a mid-grade Nikon camera that can autofocus this thing? I'd still say no, for two reasons. First, the lens is soft. Your pictures won't be sharp. If it's the only lens you've ever used except for your kit lens, you'll have to trust me on this. Pretty much every other Nikon lens out there is sharper than this one. Second, the physics of taking picture with a 300mm f/5.6 lens on a DX camera mean that you're only going to get a decent picture in bright bright sunshine. Clouds? Early or late in the day? Indoors? Forget it. You're either going to have to crank the ISO up so that the picture is noisy, or you're going to have to use a shutter speed that's so slow that you get camera shake in every shot.I had this lens once upon a time, and always thought the problem was that I was a bad photographer. Now that I know more, I realize that it was this awful lens. The best thing I ever did was sell it.Recommendations? The 70-300 4-5.6 VR lens is quite good. It's somewhere around $600, but it's worth saving for. Another recommendation if you want cheaper, is the 55-200 VR. It doesn't have as much reach, but at $250, it's actually quite good for the price.

My impression is that it is definitely a budget lens but it does a pretty good job for the price.  It appears to be well-constructed and it is fairly light weight as the overall construction is  made of nicely molded composite-type plastic, so it is not flimsy.  The lens comes with a hood and the telephoto adjustment action of the barrel is just as smooth as my kit lens. This lens does not have its own built-in autofocus motor, nor an aperature adjustment ring. However, the D90 does have its own AF motor, which handles the auto focus and aperature just fine, it is pretty fast and accurate.  If your camera is the D5000/3000 or D40/60 which do not have an AF motor, I would recommend you avoid this lens unless you have a lot of time ad skill to manual focus your shots.  The lens is definitely much softer than my kit VR lens, and definitely not tack-sharp, especially at 200 to 300 mm range, and it needs bright sunshine outside to operate well.  It's really not an indoor-use lens unless you have a high ISO and some serious flash capability.  Even though this lens lacks the vibration reduction (VR) feature, it is possible to hand-hold it and get some really good shots even at the far end of the range.  However, a tripod or even a monopod provide much better stability for fast action shots.  I also added a Tiffen 62mm polarizing filter on this lens and that seems to make the colors better but doesn't help the sharpness, so I would still recommend using a filter with this lens.

I probably wouldn't have bought it on my own b/c of it's limitations.  But now that I do I have it, I use it selectively.Here's the key--for what this lens is, it's excellent.  But you need to recognize that it's got limits.1.  It's \"slow\" on multiple levels.  If you use autofocus (for instance, shooting sports), there are much faster lens out there.  If you shoot in poor light, this is an unacceptable lens...an f4.5 aperture just won't get it done while shooting football at night or inside a basketball arena with artificial lighting.2.  In good natural light with objects that aren't moving fast (wildlife, athletes, cars), this is a very good lens and it's unbelievably cheap for giving you this focal length/range and being a Nikon build.For instance, I just used this to shoot a Civil War re-enactment.  We were roped off as far as 200 yards from some of the action.  It was in daylight with good light, people moving on foot or horseback at a steady pace.  I started out using my 200mm f2.8 and switched to this lens.  I had 3 other photographers approach me during the event to ask if I'd mind sharing photos...they were shooting with either 200mm glass or they were using extension tubes (which got them closer but they weren't as happy with how sharp their images were).", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Impatiently waiting...", "Author": "Brittany  Morrill", "ReviewID": "RB4GD3XD1AVAG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ordered this via Amazon Prime's \"two-day shipping\" about a week and a half ago and still haven't gotten it.

I work as a wildlife biologist (with birds) in very remote, harsh places and have put this lens through quite a test, using it in rain, snow, salty air, banging it on rocks, dropping it. I have had enough bird poop on it to last me a lifetime but this lens is a champ, after all that I am STILL amazed at the quality of this lens (for the price).Lens feels cheap and plasticy, but has not fallen apart in any way and the plastic only makes it lighter so really I can't complain. If you're going to carry a telephoto lens all over place like I do, the lightweight build is a good thing!Optically, this lens is unbeatable for the price in this focal range. I have tried Sigma and Tamron lenses of similar ranges and have not been as pleased as I am with the Nikon version. Granted, you can't use the lens wide open, it needs to be stopped down, and from 200mm-300mm the pictures become pretty soft shooting moving animals (birds) even in broad daylight. This lens is excellent for good lighting and slowly moving subjects but quality quickly goes downhill after that. That being said, I have hand-held photos of flying seabirds off rocking boats at 300mm and am still able to get pictures that identify the birds, but would never win any photo contests.Contrast, color, bokeh, sharpness - all of these are lacking compared to more upscale versions of the lens, and once you get comfortable using the 70-300mm f/4-5.6G AF, you will be left wanting better quality over all.As a beginner who needed a sturdy lens to do the job and do it right, I chose this lens and have not been happier.

I mean it's not a lousy lens as some would say it to be but a functional at least. Obviously Nikon had to cut some corners hence the plastic mount and non-ED glass. Also it doesn't have the silent wave motor meaning you have to focus manually if you are using a D5100/5200 and below model. But on a positive note, it can still take sharp pictures. Though at 200mm-300mm, there may CA issues. But then again what do you expect at this price level? As long as you know the limitations of this lens and you can still get great photos. Just see the user posted pictures. In short this lens though not really fantastic is a good starter telephoto lens for the money.
