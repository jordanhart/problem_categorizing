Mainly for the color (green, her favorite), but it turns out to be a nice camera. Easy to operate, takes nice photos. Can even take videos and has a rechargeable battery (bonus).

Ganguly", "ReviewID": "R2V60M1K0TR3XR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera on the premise that for the kind of features this camera packs in, it was a steal at $150 or so. Or, so I thought. Let me draw some context here - If you love driving the BMW 750, along comes Hyundai with their Azerus and they claim it packs in all the goodies of a BMW 750 at 40% the price. And you know it is not really the same thing. In short the camera fails onClarity of Picture (It is not stunning at all. My Canon Powershot A10 bought 7 years ago has far far far better images/clarity than this Casio).It is a fast camera ~ This is definitely a plus.Has a decent Video camera recording facility. Is intuitive.Has nice number of preset options for taking pictures.But you should reconsider buying this.....I am planning to go with Panasonic LX3 or the Canon SD800. They're more expensive but going by all the reviews I've seen they seem very much worth it.", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "poor quality product", "Author": "Grace Doumanian \"grace\"", "ReviewID": "R185NL8WOTOEJ4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Basically, this is a nice-looking camera, easy to use, but it's not good quality.  It has stopped working on me 3 times in 9 months.  the first time it stopped working I had only had it for 4 months.  I sent it back to Casio twice and both times they \"fixed\" it free of charge, which leads me to believe the camera is defective.  Now it stopped working again---mostly lens problems.  I give up, I'm just going to purchase another camera-and NOT a EXILIM.", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "C. turlington \"Rummy\"", "ReviewID": "R21ZRRZSJAQAX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great,pictures are clear and crisp. THE SCREEN IS HUGE,i mean like it takes up the entire back of the camera. Video quality is great,color is kick@$$. You cant go wrong,my grandmom has a new sony cybershot same specs, and this one blows it away.", "Date": "May 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "good camera for the price", "Author": "roxpipi", "ReviewID": "R3V0MR9UZMMONC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I lost my digital camera and bought this one as a replacement, mainly because of the price, about 2 months ago. I completely love it. This is a great camera if you are someone like me: while I like to take pictures, I don't take tons of them, and I'm basically interested in snapshot and keepsake pictures--I'm not trying to take \"artsy\" photographs most of the time. To me, the picture quality is wonderful--while I'm sure there's better out there, it's far better than average. It's a very fast camera, is small and easy to use, and has good battery life. So far no complaints at all!", "Date": "February 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "This Camera is Pretty Good!!!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RAA048NKQDVU3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got this camera today, and I am really pleased with it. I've read other reviews about it saying that it took a long time for the picture to be taken, but it actually is pretty fast! Some of the things I really like about it is 1. The screen is HUGE! 2. The instruction manual is very easy to follow 3. The picture quality is pretty good. I've seen cameras that have even better quality, but this is still ok. Some of the things I don't like are 1. When you listen to a recorded video, the sound is very soft. You can barely hear it. 2. It's kind of hard to control the zoom. If you want it at just the right zoom, you have to put a little more effort in than I think nesscary. But overall, I am very pleased with this camera.", "Date": "July 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Casio Exilim EX-150", "Author": "D.

The battery seemed to last forever.  Videos are nice, and easy to play on a Windows computer.After a week, though, the screen developed two lines running down the side.  Casio and Adorama agreed that it was probably a defect.  The return went smoothly, and everyone was very nice to me on the phone.I ended up buying an EX-Z80 to replace it, mostly because I wanted a slightly smaller and lighter camera to carry around, and just to try something different.  Anyway I still love Casio's.  The menus are the best, and the pictures are fine.  I have an EX-Z4 that's still going strong.", "Date": "December 27, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "8MP with 4x zoom\nWide angle lens\nYou Tube ready\nCCD shift stablizer\nFace detection", "Name": "Casio Exilim EX-150GN 8MP 4x Zoom 3-Inch LCD Screen Digital Camera with 28mm Wide Angle Lens CCD-shift Image Optical Stabilizer (Green)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511y8eeIdTL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001F9I47G"}}
