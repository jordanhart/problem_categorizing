{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good starter Deep Sky cam, but...", "Author": "The DINK", "ReviewID": "RQI6GA7IDTCU9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my first dedicated deep sky astronomy camera.  I've used an Imaging Source and an OpticStar planetary video cam before, and I've done some deep sky with my dSLR.  This thing is a huge step forward over those.  The results I've been getting far exceeded my expectations based on what I'd achieved before.  However, as of right now, there are a few issues with the software that comes with it (Ver. 1.1.0 as of this writing)( at least in vista and 7).  I've been talking with their support people.  They seem to be working on it so we'll see.  Basically right now you have to shoot in raw mode, and some of the fine adjustments in the software don't do anything.  Color mode currently doesn't process reds.  The gain, offset, and fine histogram adjustments don't work.  Also the exposure adjustment goes in 1 second intervals, so you have to type in the exposure you want if you need something in between like while focusing or doing planetary work.  I also hate that the loop exposure mode has such a lag between shots (I guess it's expected since it takes a while to download the image from the camera) and that you have to stop and restart the loop to see any changes you've made in exposure - it doesn't register changes until you stop the loop.  That said, you can still get surprisingly good results.  A single .4 second exposure that I did of Jupiter beats the crap out of anything I got stacking video from either of the other cams.  With my Orion 120st, the M42 is visible with less than 5 sec exposure - not well, and the trapezium is blown because of the histogram settings you have to use, but visible.  The flame nebula is just visible in about 40.  The magnification on this cam is seems pretty high, plan on using a reducer of some sort.  Without a reducer, M42 barely (mostly) fits in the FOV with the 120st which has only 600mm focal length.  I do sorta wish it had higher resolution, but I don't regret buying this at all.  Once Orion gets the software bugs worked out, this will be a great system.  Right now, I'd recommend it but with some reservations because of the software.Update: 3/3/12If you get one of these, whatever you do, do *NOT* try to update the firmware through the update firmware menu option in Orion Camera Studio.  If you do, it will tell you it needs to put the camera in 'programming mode'- after which your computer will stop recognizing it as a camera and decide it is: 'AT32UC3B,' a 'LibUSB-Win32 Device.'  Camera Studio itself doesn't recognize the camera after that point. If you try to go back to the firmware updater it will say that it can't find the camera and that the camera may already be in programming mode.  The only thing you can do in the updater is browse your computer looking for an 'elf' file  (which I assume is the file type for the firmware) - it does not check online for a new version.  As there currently isn't one on Orion's webpage for manual download, you are stuck at this point and pretty much screwed.  There isn't any way out of programming mode - at least I haven't found a way out yet.  So, right now my camera is an expensive paperweight unless tech support can come up with a solution.  I'll update this again if they come through with the fix.  All in all, still unsatisfied with the sorry software that came with this otherwise capable entry level camera.Update:About a week later the tech support guys emailed me a copy of the latest firmware.  Mine originally had ver. 1.01.  The version they sent is 1.07.  According to tech support, going into programming mode wipes the firmware from the camera.  Why they don't have it posted on their webpage for download is a mystery.Update:Honestly, the more they try to fix this thing, the worse it gets software wise.  After updating to the latest version of the Orion Camera Studio, now the raw photos have the color messed up.  I didn't think to try one of the color modes to see if they've fixed that, but c'mon Orion.  My latest attempt was the double cluster which is well known to be clusters of blue stars with a few red stars mixed in.  All the blue stars were green, and the red stars were purple.  The colors are flipped somewhere in the pipeline...should be easy to fix, but we're going the wrong way.  And still no firmware available on the webpage.Update:I may have to take back some stuff I said in the previous update.  I noticed something recently that I hadn't expected.  When you install the new version of the software, it does not overwrite the previous version, but puts the new one in a different folder.  I expect that there is also a shared data folder of some sort that is getting overwritten.  Basically, I've been using the same desktop shortcut to open the program.  It appears that I've been using an old version of the main program mixed with some newer files that may not be completely compatible.  Poor skies and work have kept me from checking, but I was still running v1.2 after installing v1.4.  They've released v1.5 since I've had a chance to go out and see what difference, if any, it makes.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Orion Starshoot G3 CCD Camera", "Author": "Pintado10", "ReviewID": "R2LVIZUUJOGXI6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being in a light polluted area, I was becoming frustrated not being able to see most of Messier Galaxies and Nebulas, let alone see any detail within them .  So the only solution to this problem was going to astrophotography, if I had any hope of seeing the objects.So I took my first step into CCD imaging, with the goal of understanding the issues without spending a ton of money.  So I purchased the camera and began using it on my 4\" Celestron f10 refractor and my C8 SGTwith f6.3 reducer.The software was easy to load into my windows 7 HP laptop, and has run without any real issues.  Note: the camera software and picture processing are done within the same window - no bouncing between different packages.  Camera is made well and very solid.On my first night using the camera (and following the directions from the manual) I was going to look for M66 & M96....  After focusing on a faint star, I setup the camera for a single shot of 15 seconds at M66, when the camera completed the exposure and downloaded it to the PC screen, I saw a faint image of M66!  I increased the exposure to 45 seconds and the picture revealed more detail!  I was able to find and observe M96 as well that night!  Over the last few months I've photographed 27+ Messier objects (I've started a album in Powerpoint of all the shots).  The Whirlpool galaxy (M51) is really clear and huge with this camera at 45 to 50 seconds unguided.Some tricks I've learned, take a Dark frame with each object!  Take at least 5 to 6 sequence photos (more would be better).  Currently all shots are unguided, so my mount/setup only allows me to get to 50 to 60 seconds max, beyond that and you get star streaks.  FOV in my C8 f6.3 is approximately 40 arc-minutes, kinda narrow but not a deal breaker (chip is small vs. regular sized CCD chips).  For the software to process your images (align & stack), you do need to get good exposures, +30 seconds(faint ones cause errors).  For successful alignment, select star size of either 12 to 14, default is 8.Targeting the object in a small FOV for my Celestron SGT mount has not been a problem.  But I do have nights that the object is not in the FOV and I need to go find it....  After a while, I just re-polar align, and star align the mount, and that fixes the issue.Again, the camera and software work really well - credit to Orion.My next step, is to purchase an Orion f5 astrophotography Refractor to increase my FOV and the faster scope will create brighter images, but smaller.  I'm also looking at getting a guider to break the 60 second barrier.Hope this helps you....", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "My first Deep Sky Astrocamera", "Author": "Keith R Woodard", "ReviewID": "R2XHDJ4PWY18QC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Once you get past the firmware, driver, and Studio updates, this camera is easy to setup with only a novice understanding of astrophotography. I took some great shots of M42 for example and in color with just 7 seconds exposure with my Celestron NexStar SE8.
